Introduction
This article explores mentoring experiences of 17 mentors
and 16 student teachers (herein called students) during a
4-week residential practicum in a rural South African school.
The students were part of a Rural Teacher Education Project
(RTEP) which set out to examine alternative models of
Teaching Practice (TP) placement to service rural schools.
By contrast to other rural preservice teacher placement, these
students were placed at one school as a cohort, and shared
residential facilities nearby the school in a community of
teacher educators and peers.
Each student was attached to at least two mentors (one per
subject) who provided on-the-spot subject specialization
guidance and support. Mentors were expected to assume
multifaceted roles: guiding, supervising, counseling, over-
seeing, modeling, supporting, critiquing, and instructing
(Larkin, 2013). It is the experiences of students and mentors
that are the subject of this article.
Much has been documented about mentoring students on
TP in extant literature (Aderibigbe, 2013; Kaasila &
Lauriala, 2010; Leshem, 2012). However, this literature is
seemingly dominated by a focus on mentors and students'
experiences in isolation. Not much is known about mentor-
ing experiences of students and mentors during TP while
students reside alongside the community, sharing residen-
tial facilities with their peers and teacher educators in a
rural context. Much less is known about how large student
cohorts attached to one rural school and their respective
mentors experience mentoring in such contexts. This makes
the study distinctive.

Mentoring in a Cohort Model of
Practicum: Mentors and Preservice
Teachers' Experiences in a Rural
South African School
Tabitha Grace Mukeredzi1
Abstract
Little is known about mentoring student cohorts from largely urban backgrounds doing practicum at one school, living
alongside the community, and sharing residential facilities with teacher educators in a rural context. This article reports
Bachelor of Education students' and mentors' school-based mentoring experiences during a 4-week residential practicum in
a rural setting. Data generated through in-depth group discussions with students and mentors were analyzed using content
analysis. Experiences revolved around professional support, lesson observations and feedback, collaboration, and modeling.
Notwithstanding that mentors were a source of wisdom in practical knowledge for students, they gained valuable professional
knowledge around teaching styles and learner engagement from students. Collaborations rejuvenated mentor practices
and stimulated their reflection, enthusiasm, and passion for work. Nondevelopmental experiences related to poor mentor
communication, lack of modeling lessons, and objectivity in feedback. Although the overall impression from participants
was positive, there is evidence of unequal mentor­mentee relationships and failure to construct the mentoring process as a
journey of initiation into the preservice teacher's life role. I illustrate that in-school mentoring in the South African education
context may be enhanced, if school-based teacher educators are exposed to mentoring practices and school-based supports
through comprehensive ongoing training to better prepare them for supporting not only preservice teachers but also novice
teachers.

Student mentoring during practicum constitutes a critical
factor in their professional learning and development.
Ingersoll and Strong (2011) point out that mentoring has a
positive impact on commitment, classroom instructional
practices, and student achievement. Larkin (2013) suggests
practices for effective student teacher mentoring: not just
leaving them alone, turning on the commentary track,1
working jointly to find creative outlets, modeling lessons,
modeling learning new content, joint planning and making
time to talk, connecting the student to the larger school
political world, and treating TP as a learning opportunity,
not a performance. Ambrosetti and Dekkers (2010) add that
mentoring is critical in enhancing students' opportunities to
learn to teach within teaching contexts. These authors also
posit that such learning effectively occurs through lesson
modeling and observations, critical and constructive lesson
evaluation, providing and discussing feedback, team teach-
ing, counseling and role modeling, critical friendship and
equal partnering, and instructing and coaching. However,
students view this process as the best way to acquire teacher
professional knowledge and competence and it also pro-
vides a "protected" opportunity for experimentation and
socialization within the profession (Leshem, 2012).
Aderibigbe (2013) contends that the process assists preser-
vice teachers to be proficient with pedagogical and manage-
ment skills vital for effective lesson coordination. However,
mentoring should help students not only to manage learning
but also to explore, interpret, and explain the "how" and
"why" of what happened which then flows into the next
stage of the teaching cycle, (re)planning of the next lesson
(du Plessis, 2013). Thus, mentoring makes for an effective
catalyst for learning through reflection as students learn
about the "self" in context.
Kaasila and Lauriala (2010) report that mentoring in
teacher education benefits both the mentor and the mentee.
Mentoring was found to rejuvenate mentors' careers as it
enabled them to assist and shape professional and personal
development of mentees (Kaasila & Lauriala, 2010). Other
mentor benefits include increased confidence and personal
fulfillment. Despite this evidence, it is also believed that as
learning is individualistic, good teachers can work individu-
ally to achieve education goals. This perhaps, justifies the
argument that mentoring should be studied constantly within
specific contexts (Aderibigbe, 2013). Against this backdrop,
this article addresses the following research question:
Research Question 1: How did mentors and mentees
experience mentoring during a 4-week residential practi-
cum in a rural school?
There is quality inherent in rural schools and communities
which should be preserved (Arnold, Newman, Gaddy, &
Dean, 2005) such as contextual aptness for teacher prepara-
tion. Rurality in this study illustrates that these settings can
be effective sites for student professional learning. Insights
from the study may stimulate more research in rural educa-
tion and also provide pointers to teacher educators and policy
makers as they appraise and reconsider teacher development
programs.
First, this article discusses specifics of the Rural Teacher
Education Project (RTEP) and the research site which set the
context for the study. The South African Rural context con-
stitutes the next section, followed by a conceptual frame-
work for the study. The data production strategies used are
dealt with in the subsequent section, followed by presenta-
tion of findings. The last section concludes the article and
highlights some implications for practice.
The RTEP
The RTEP, a rural school­university partnership project, was
undertaken by the Faculty of Education, in collaboration
with rural schools in districts approximately 150 km north-
west of Durban in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province.
Launched in 2007, the project emerged out of the need to
address rural education, community development, and
teacher preparation (Islam, 2012). Although the university
teacher education programs did not discriminate against
rural school TP placements, students were not expected to
undertake practicum in such schools, but were required to
experience TP in both resourced and underresourced set-
tings. Consequently students sought placements in urban set-
tings closer to transportation and accommodation. The RTEP
emerged partly to counter this urban bias.
Broadly, the project focused on rural education by com-
bining research, intervention, and teacher education strate-
gies (Balfour, 2012). It tried to understand how learning and
teaching can be a means of professional development through
cooperation between in-service teachers in rural schools and
cohorts of preservice teachers. The RTEP also tried to
encourage preservice teachers, mentors, and education lead-
ers to act as agents for social change in rural settings (Islam,
2012). From a methodological perspective, the RTEP
intended to understand how schools could become resources
for, and be located to stimulate and lead, broader processes
of community development and rural transformation (Islam,
Mitchell, De Lange, Balfour, & Combrink, 2011). Thus, it
aimed to carefully reorient teacher education within the
Education Faculty so that rural schools could be recognized
as major learning sites for preservice teacher preparation
(Balfour, 2012).
Student participation in the project was voluntary. The
RTEP was widely publicized in the faculty, and students
applied formally and were interviewed for selection. They
had to express interest in rural school teaching; be in second,
third, or fourth year of study; be in Senior Phase or Further
Education and Training; and specializing in technology, man-
agement studies, English, computer studies, mathematics, or
science. Students in the Foundation Phase who could com-
municate in isiZulu (local language) were also considered.
Mukeredzi 3
For effective coordination, the project team appointed at
least two advisors/teacher educators for on-site leadership.
Usually, at least one advisor had a PhD in Teacher Education.
This is how I joined the RTEP in 2011. At the time, I was a
resident postdoctorate with a PhD in Teacher Education. The
advisors/teacher educators shared residential facilities with
students approximately 3 kilometers from the school. They
helped ferry students to and from school, typically remaining
at the school site to provide immediate support to the preser-
vice teachers, facilitating and attending to their activities and
professional dimensions. Each day was accompanied by
briefing and debriefing reflection sessions organized and led
by advisors between 4:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. where students'
experiences of professional learning in a rural school were
discussed and interrogated to make for a rigorous process of
collaborative learning through reflection.
The South African Rural Context
The concept "rural" is complex and difficult to define.
Defining it eludes those who attempt to understand it due to
its ambiguity and the flawed comparisons with urban
(Hlalele, 2012). Coladarci (2007) notes that there is no sin-
gular or multifaceted definition that would suffice to satisfy
research, program, and policy groups that utilize this con-
cept. This is due to the vagueness of the term and the subjec-
tive nature of distinctions with urban (du Plessis, 2013;
Kline, White, & Lock, 2013). The situation is further com-
pounded by the fact that scholars often overlook contextual
differences between rural and urban as school curricula and
practices are outstandingly similar (Howley, 1997).
Rural areas globally experience social ills and hindrances
to quality student achievements: low learner attainments;
poor financing and resourcing; a dearth of family social and
cultural facilities and services; unfriendly policies; problems
of "hard to staff, harder to stay" due to prevailing discourse of
deficiency which regard rural school teaching as low-grade;
schools distantly located and communities characterized by
disease and poverty; scarce economic activities and opportu-
nities; reduced population and literacy levels; family detach-
ment and seclusion; and low self-esteem of those who live
and work there (Arnold et al., 2005; Balfour, 2012; Hlalele,
2012; Kline et al., 2013; Lowe, 2006; McEwan, 1999;
Moletsane, 2012; Redding & Walberg, 2012). Islam et al.
(2011) add that rurality is concerned with space, isolation,
community, poverty, disease, neglect, backwardness, margin-
alization, depopulation, conservatism, racism, resettlement,
corruption, entropy, and exclusion. These obstacles adversely
impact on education quality achievement, consequently giv-
ing rise to associating rurality with deficiencies and disadvan-
tage (Gardiner, 2008; Hlalele, 2012; Moletsane, 2012).
Rurality in this study is understood synonymously with
remote. The term remote area implies underclass models that
describe conceptions of rurality in social development
(Chikoko, 2008). Consequently rurality signifies social
disadvantage on the people in question. Such people are
often partly or fully socially discounted from active national
mainstream sociopolitical participation. In South Africa, fea-
tures of rurality also include low literacy levels among adults
and poor education quality in schools (Gardiner, 2008).
Defining rural from a South Africa perspective, Wedekind
(2005) reveals that during apartheid government, the
Separate Development Act of 1936 and Group Areas'Act of
1953 forced native Black South Africans to live in deep rural
or homeland areas. Currently those former homelands are
characterized by poor infrastructure and services/facilities,
and portray village-style settlements or dense homesteads.
Communities in the former homelands of KwaZulu-Natal,
Eastern Cape, and Limpopo provinces today are the poorest
and least developed South African rural areas where poverty
and underdevelopment are evident in the poor education
quality available there (Gardiner, 2008). Thus, most South
African rural schools are generally deficient in learning and
infrastructural resources and basic services/facilities as they
were disregarded as sites for development for a long time.
With these limitations, some rural areas are so deteriorated
that they are disregarded as an attractive choice for a teach-
ing career or for living (Islam et al., 2011). A thriving econ-
omy, adequate health facilities, and quality education are
often nonexistent, contributing to poverty, illness, and lower
literacy levels. The site for the present research was located
in such contexts.
The South African government through many policy ini-
tiatives and the establishment of Rural Education Directorate
acknowledges rural education as priority (Islam et al., 2011).
However, Moletsane (2012) laments the many challenges
that still plague rural education which Mukeredzi and
Mandrona (2013) attribute to mismatches between policy
implementation, rural realities, and government response.
This is notwithstanding that many school-age children reside
in rural settings. Statistics South Africa (2015) reports that
40% of the entire South African population resides in nonur-
ban areas. KwaZulu-Natal province has approximately 54%
of the population residing in rural areas with about 3,000
rural schools that accommodate more than 1,000,000 learn-
ers (Gardiner, 2008).
Kline et al. (2013) recommend the development of strong
partnerships between institutions and rural schools for effec-
tive preservice teacher training, and support for rural school
teaching appointments. Such partnerships could enable insti-
tutions and schools to engage in collaborative reflections,
continuously evaluating and challenging existing practices
and philosophies to generate theories aligned with contem-
porary South Africa. This could make teacher education
more responsive to rural schools, while shaping perceptions
and professional growth of a new crop of teachers (Islam,
2012). The RTEP viewed the cohort model as effective in
promoting partnerships and teacher preparation for rural
school postings. Haugalokken and Ramberg (2007) highlight
two partnership models--where institutions control the
4 SAGE Open
cooperation--and a cooperative model with equal partner-
ship between schools and institutions. The RTEP tried to
establish the latter type of model.
The Research Site
The site for the RTEP in 2014 was Mxolo (Pseudonym)
Catholic combined school. A combined school combines pri-
mary and secondary sectors under one principal, and often
has classes from Grade R to Grade 12. Located centrally
within rural village settlements, Mxolo school enrollment
was approximately 1,450 with 39 staff. This was a big enroll-
ment for a rural school, but given its central location, amid
densely populated multiple villages and, without another
school nearby, Mxolo inevitably serviced large enrollments.
RTEP was attracted to Mxolo because of its combined struc-
ture which enabled placing all students under one "roof."
This was ideal for on-site support where teacher educators
remained at one site as opposed to dividing time between
sites. All participating students undertook practicum at this
school. The school portrayed cleanliness, orderliness, good
discipline, a calm and business-like atmosphere, and respect-
ful, neatly dressed learners. The principal lamented underre-
sourcing particularly for large classes; Grades 8 to 10 with 70
to 80 learners. Office space was inadequate, consequently
the RTEP team used the school library as an office. This
space promoted interaction among students and within the
RTEP, but tended to create "borders" between students and
schoolteachers.
Conceptual Framework
The study draws on (Awaya et al., 2003) conceptualization of
mentoring. Awaya et al. identified five themes that inform
effective mentoring: mentoring conceived as a journey,
equality in the relationship, mentor as source of practical
knowledge, mentor as source of moral support, and mentor
provision of space for the mentee to prove their worth.
The mentor­mentee relationship conceived as a journey:
Many searches are woven throughout the Odyssey of
Homer story: Odysseus the father searching for his home-
land, Telemachus the son searching for his father, and
more profoundly, Telemachus's journey of self-discovery
striving to prove his worth as heir to his father's throne
(Awaya et al., 2003). From the Odyssey of Homer story,
mentoring was understood from the apprenticeship model.
The meaning of mentoring has since evolved and is now
viewed as a process that facilitates career development
and fosters an individual's skill and professional growth
(Leshem, 2012). In this study, drawing on the Odyssey of
Homer story, the student teacher is on a professional jour-
ney of socialization and initiation into teaching, and they
are seeking their role in life as a teacher (Allen, Evans,
Ng, & DuBois, 2008). The student teacher is the seeker of
professional knowledge and skills while the mentor sym-
bolizes a source of knowledge and practical wisdom
(Leshem, 2012).
Equality in the relationship: The term mentor is associ-
ated with "friendly care and assistance" which heightens
the pivotal value of caring and friendship in mentoring
(Awaya et al., 2003). In the Odyssey, Mentor signifies the
king's trusted servant and Telemachus is his son. In this
study, the mentor's authority is derived from their knowl-
edge, skills, and experience as a teacher and not status or
position in the school (Heeralal & Bayaga, 2011). Thus,
the mentoring relationship is expected to be at a collegial
echelon, based on shared values, goals, and understand-
ings (Maphalala, 2013).
Mentor as guide to practical knowledge: Mentor symbol-
izes Telemachus's advisor, acting as a mouthpiece of wis-
dom, offering practical advice and guidance, shielding
from harm, and directing his steps while searching for his
father. The mentor is expected to direct and guide the stu-
dent teacher on their professional journey, offering them
practical knowledge and guidance, targeting their imme-
diate teaching activities not external viewpoints/premoni-
tions, but addressing the student's professional issues of
"here" and "now" (Awaya et al., 2003). The mentor's
guiding roles include assisting the student teacher: in
refining existing instructional strategies, introducing new
strategies and concepts, engaging in conversations about
their teaching; modeling lessons and professionalism, and
providing overall support (Maphalala, 2013). Through
such guidance, the student teacher can tackle problems
and challenges, and begin to see new paths to solutions
(Allen et al., 2008; Awaya et al., 2003).
Mentor as source of moral support: Mentor appropriately
breathes vigor into Telemachus. The mentor is expected
to urge the student teacher forward to confront new
encounters without intervening directly in the student's
action but supporting them through wise counsel and
encouragement, and continuously urging them into apt
action (du Plessis, 2013). This according to Awaya et al.
(2003) is "confidence building."
Providing space for Telemachus to prove his worth:
Although the mentor offers advice and wise counsel to
the "protégé," he knows when to stand back to let
Telemachus show off his worth. As a measure of trust,
mentor stands back from the action to let Telemachus
"show his stuff" (Awaya et al., 2003, p. 50) without
granting Telemachus victory, but only testing his strength.
The student teacher must show what he or she is "made
of," portray a true version of himself or herself, and dem-
onstrate appropriate capabilities to earn a good standing,
without the intercession of the mentor (du Plessis, 2013;
Maphalala, 2013). Mentors are expected to be aware of
when to stand back, and the student teacher must be will-
ing and prepared to tackle some tasks alone, displaying
willingness to demonstrate that they are made of the
Mukeredzi 5
"right material." Leshem (2012) points out that student
teachers often want to learn, and do so best when they
feel free to express and choose their own direction and
engage in experimentation. When mentors are able to do
this, then they fulfill a dual role of teacher and learning
facilitator. Thus, mentors must help student teachers to
identify what direction learning should take and facilitate
the best conditions for this to occur, while allowing the
trainee to engage in trial and error.
Method
A qualitative approach was adopted to investigate mentoring
experiences of 17 mentors and 16 students from their per-
spectives. Qualitative orientation views reality as constructed
by individuals intersubjectively from socially and experien-
tially developed meanings and understandings (Cohen,
Manion, & Morrison, 2011). As this study sought to explore
mentoring experiences of students and mentors, from their
perspectives, a qualitative methodology was appropriate.
Data were generated through in-depth group discussions
with participants, in line with the qualitative naturalistic
methods (interviews, observation, discussions, text analy-
sis), which ensure adequate researcher-researched dialogue
during the social construction of meaningful reality (Cohen
et al., 2011).
There were 22 mentors in total for these students but five
did not participate in the study. The mentors' biographical
details show diversity in gender, race, teaching experience,
and subject specialization. Students were also diverse in
gender, race, level of study, and subject specialization.
Participants' biographical details are reflected in Table 1.
Data were drawn from transcripts of group discussions
and audio records of group reports. Mentors and students
formed specialization groupings (five groups each) to make
for discussions on common mentors/students. Data genera-
tion lasted 3 days: one day for mentors and two afternoons
for students. Participants worked in groups providing
detailed insights into their mentoring experiences. The activ-
ity had two sessions: group discussion and recording find-
ings; and group reports which were audio-recorded. After an
explanation of what participants were required to do, the
groups embarked on intensive discussions before recording
their experiences on flip chart for reporting back. Both audio
records and written reports were transcribed verbatim.
Content analysis was used to unpack the data. The process
involves systematically examining and interpreting data to
identify patterns and themes (Cohen et al., 2011; Creswell,
2015; Plunkett & Dyson, 2011; Singleton & Straits, 1999). In
this study, it involved reading transcripts and listening to
audio-records several times, making brief notes of emerging
important experiences in the margin, scrutinizing, categoriz-
ing and labeling the notes descriptively, linking related cate-
gories/themes, and recording them as major or minor
categories/themes. This process was repeated with each tran-
script. Themes/categories were then reexamined for rele-
vance to the research question. This was followed by a
process to analyze and ensure that information had been cat-
egorized appropriately; scrutinizing all themes ascertaining
whether or not some could be merged or subcategorized and

finally returning to original transcripts to make sure that all
information that needed categorization has been categorized.
Cohen et al. (2011) suggest involvement of independent
judges to verify categories of relevant meaning. Thus, I sent
the data set to the RTEP leader to obtain a critical friend per-
spective, to identify errors and omissions. I then scrutinized
the data determining how many mentor/student groups
(MGs/SGs) had reported on particular themes and whether
their experiences were developmental or nondevelopmental
and entered in a table (Table 2). Subsequently, I reexamined
data extracting quotes representative of each theme which
would enhance description of mentors' and students' experi-
ences in their words which Singleton and Straits (1999) call
". . . capturing in their language and letting them speak for
themselves" (p. 349).
Involving the RTEP leader helped to establish credibility
and trustworthiness. The University Higher Degrees and
Ethics Committee granted Ethical Clearance to the RTEP.
Findings
The mentoring experiences of mentors and student teachers
were evident in four themes: professional support; lesson
observations and feedback; mentor modeling lessons; and
collaboration. Table 2 illustrates the number that MGs and
SGs reported developmental or nondevelopmental experi-
ences related to particular themes.
Professional Support
All SGs reported experiences of the professional support that
they received and the supportive role mentors played which
positively influenced their TP. The mentors were found to be
positive, always willing to assist, guide and offer valuable
advice, and shared their skills and experiences with students.
Some SGs mentioned specific needs that their mentors helped
them to address and some mentors seemingly met their men-
tees' expectations. SG4 quoted a mentor who instinctively
understood the mentee's concerns and responded to them:
It was as if she opened my mind and saw areas that I feared. I am
there thinking, I must master them this final year. She discussed
them calmly giving me sources, suggesting methods and learner
activities. She shared her skills and experiences, always had
valuable advice, helping me through, filling all my knowledge
gaps.
Students' descriptions of mentoring experiences were gener-
ally oriented toward pragmatics of classroom practice: micro
classroom activities and teaching strategies, and immediate
guiding action for "here" and "now" (Awaya et al., 2003).
Students also gave examples of some teaching techniques
which they had acquired through mentoring: "knowing how
to explain; making teaching material relevant; raising learner
curiosity using interesting and motivating strategies and
aids; gained insights into organizing teaching material; learnt
ways of relating to pupils; and how to build rapport." In
highlighting these developmental experiences, students
acknowledged capabilities of their mentors describing them
as knowledgeable and competent depicting sources of practi-
cal knowledge and wisdom (Awaya et al., 2003). However,
three groups (SG1, SG4, and SG5) also included some non-
developmental experiences. For example,
What dismayed me was that he introduced me as his assistant
and told learners that I was a student like them . . . I can't be like
his learners, I am qualifying this year. (SG5)
Mukeredzi 7
We met for daily planning and she said she wasn't going to class,
I should go. I had not planned, so I had to plan and teach there
and then. Mentors are not communicating with us! They must
communicate on teaching issues. (SG1)
I was upset, he sent the class outside to play when I was supposed
to teach. They don't see the need to tell us because we are
students, but communication is important. (SG4)
Remarks by SG5 may lead to students getting discouraged,
feeling inadequate, and losing confidence in their ability to
teach contrary to expectations by Awaya et al. (2003) where
the mentor should offer moral support and breathe vigor into
the mentee. What was seemingly underlying students' con-
cern for respect was the need for "acceptance" as colleagues.
SG1 and SG4 indicate lack of communication. Preservice
teachers are often excited to be part of a real school setting
with open communication from their mentors, other staff and
school management. The evidence above is contrary to these
expectations.
All MGs reported positive mentoring experiences but
portrayed a wider perspective of mentoring support, pointing
out that they challenged students, imparted knowledge in
motivating ways, and performed mentoring duties effec-
tively. They generally indicated that they enjoyed working
closely with students sharing ideas, skills, and plans. This
seemingly confirmed understanding mentoring as a journey
and mentors as sources of knowledge (Awaya et al., 2003).
They highlighted that there was more to the experiences that
was valuable as explained by MG1:
We got a different perspective to reflecting on what we did and
why. When students, joined us, we already had schedules and
lessons written. So we had to re-examine them critically
knowing we would share with students. We learnt new ways of
teaching, designing learner activities, assessments and discipline.
We started critiquing our lessons: was it effective? Were
instructions clear? All because of working with students.
Mentors became more reflective and critical of their peda-
gogical practices and learnt new strategies in the course of
mentoring students. The description above lays emphasis on
mentors learning rather than mentees. The very presence of
the preservice teachers seemingly stimulated reflection-on-
practice to provide a positive image to student teachers. MG4
added,
Students were enthusiastic and initiative which pushed us to
reflect on our work. Their presence was an energy which
propelled us; like more energy breathed into us. From nowhere
we became enthusiastic, our morale and passion just grew.
Other MGs reported specific aspects in which they had real-
ized growth from mentoring student teachers: "Having them
made us more tolerant, more understanding, and supportive"
(MG2). "Conversations with them helped us to understand
our pedagogical procedures which improved our teaching"
(MG5).
Lesson Observations and Feedback
With regard to lesson observations and feedback, what
"stands" out in both mentors' (four MGs) and students' texts
(five SGs) is the acknowledgment of feedback as crucial and
a major source of teaching knowledge but with slightly dif-
ferent orientation. Mentors seemingly regarded feedback
sessions as "intellectual dialogues" which stimulated stu-
dents' reflection and learning from their own practice while
students saw it as something that helped them to develop the
craft of teaching. Four MGs reported developmental experi-
ences related to feedback. For example,
We point out students' teaching characteristics. Although we
aim at developing them into good, committed teachers, everyone
is unique, with own background, character, and style. We give
them frequent feedback, isolating strengths and weaknesses then
assist them addressing the weak points. (MG1)
We ask them to evaluate themselves, the problems they faced,
the effectiveness of their teaching approaches, and what they
will do to improve. This reflection makes them learn from their
errors. We won't tell them what they should have done, but
make them see. Feedback is immediately after the lesson and
does not only focus on theoretical levels but we also use our
practical experiences. (MG3)
The evidence suggests working from the students' own level
of expertise, developing their abilities and strengths so that
they sharpen their pedagogical skills. MG1 highlights regu-
lar feedback. Students should receive feedback for each les-
son they have been observed teaching. Developing students
into effective professionals drawing on their individualities
tends to heighten the mentor's role. MG3 rather gives weight
to the mentors' experiences and skills but again emphasizes
practical knowledge. As well, leading students through
reflection so that they develop answers to challenges implies
guidance, urging them forward to see new paths to solutions
(Awaya et al., 2003). MG3 highlights another crucial dimen-
sion of feedback: its immediacy. The longer the time gap
between work completion and its feedback, the less effective
that feedback becomes. Thus ideally, feedback should be
provided within minutes of the task completion (immedi-
ately following the lesson). MG4, however, highlighted non-
developmental experiences of feedback:
Sometimes we felt very insecure during feedback. We had to be
selective on what to say to avoid hurting them. Many times we
left out some of the comments we had recorded during the
lesson.
Basically, feedback indicates performance in the efforts to
reach a goal and is understood as one of the powerful
8 SAGE Open
influences on achievement. Hence, being honest and objective
in feeding back places the student on the right path to their
goal of professional proficiency. It is not what is said which
hurts but how it is said. Thus, this calls for diplomacy and tact
on the part of the mentor. The views above by MG4 contradict
this value of feedback. They clearly did not view mentoring as
a journey (Awaya et al., 2003).
All SGs (five) reported both developmental and nonde-
velopmental experiences of mentor lesson observations and
feedback. Students generally portrayed feedback as having
given them insights into lesson organization and presenta-
tion, class management, and learner motivation. They saw
the feedback sessions as vital for receiving mentors'practical
guidance, knowledge, and wisdom, and obtaining encour-
agement which built their confidence (Awaya et al., 2003).
SG4 said,
We discussed lessons, their complements encouraged and gave
us confidence. Feedback is effective when the mentor is honest
and objective. We need to know our strengths and weakness in
order to maintain strengths and improve on the weaknesses.
SG3 added,
We gained in this TP because of strong, just, constructive
criticism given in a compassionate way. Honest advice given
gently is what we needed. It made us reflect and learn.
Mentees need knowledge of how well they are performing as
knowledge of good performance gives them a sense of their
worth which breathes vigor into them (Awaya et al., 2003).
SG4 highlights honest, objective feedback. Similarly, stu-
dents should know when they make mistakes so that they
learn from them and take corrective measures. Although all
SGs reported developmental experiences regarding feed-
back, they all also recorded some nondevelopmental experi-
ences as some of their mentors did not offer constructive
feedback. To illustrate, SG2 said,
She was lovely, wanted to be everybody's mother, treating us
like her children but didn't tell us the things we were doing well
or wrong yet other mentors were professional.
For three students (in different groups), feedback was
extremely limited. Quoting one student SG1 said, "I was left
in my own practice."Another in SG3 reported overcritical and
destructive feedback, "It's not the content of feedback, it's
how they talk." SG4 recorded a mentor as having said: "I've
written a lot but very little is positive. I wanted to vanish."
Such criticism often destroys confidence in the student's own
ability, which may encourage conformity to their mentors'
suggestions, and ways of thinking and practice, contrary to
Awaya et al.'s (2003) views of mentoring as "confidence
building." Notwithstanding the mentors' "overly negative"
attitudes, students expected mentors to be constructively
critical, appraising them on what they needed to do differently
or what required improvements. SG5 also reported one stu-
dent who did not get any feedback from one mentor who only
observed her lessons in the last week of TP.
I asked her many times to observe me but always said she was
busy. She would promise but never pitched up until the last four
days of TP as she had to complete university reports.
Mukeredzi (2009) coins this "compliance" mentoring, where
mentoring duties are performed to fulfill university student
TP assessment requirements. The university expected a stip-
ulated number of lesson observations with developmental
feedback. The behaviors reported above defeat the whole
notion of mentoring as a journey, as initiation into one's life
role where the mentor guides and supports through encour-
agement, practical knowledge, and wisdom (Awaya et al.,
2003).
Modeling
Both SGs (three SGs) and MGs (four MGs) talked about
modeling but, with slightly different orientations. The MGs
talked about modeling which included modeling lessons and
professional traits as role models, whereas students focused
on modeling lessons. Mentors emphasized that role model-
ing was a huge responsibility. Notwithstanding, they had to
portray a positive image of a model to be emulated. MG1
commented,
The main task for students is to follow and tail a good teacher's
teaching. Following an effective mentor may become a lifelong
benefit, but achieving it is a huge demanding responsibility. We
had to be punctual, as students were always punctual. Dress
code changed; you had to be presentable not scruffy, we became
enthusiastic about our work.
Being a model that students hope to become is difficult but, it
made us prepare thoroughly. Knowing that you will be watched
made you prepare and present lessons as best you could,
interacting appropriately and managing the class well. (MG5)
Comments by MG1 portray an unequal mentor­mentee rela-
tionship. Indeed, the comments to "follow and tail" portray
the mentor role as entailing presumptions of rank and a hier-
archical relationship where the mentor assumes a dominant
role and the mentee is relegated to a dependent position
(Awaya et al., 2003). Mentoring is currently conceived as a
process of growth for equal partners, coenquirers in the men-
tor­mentee journey. Although the comments also suggest
professional qualities that are "staged" due to the presence of
students, of importance, demonstrating appropriate qualities
and rapport with learners can show mentees that these behav-
iors can facilitate learning. However, MG2 reported nonde-
velopmental experiences regarding modeling lessons:
Mukeredzi 9
Being observed and the whole idea of mentoring caused anxiety
and fear. We didn't have confidence, we feared that students might
say we can't teach or we have little content. It was also stressful
because we had no time, we just forced time for mentoring.
Anxiety and fear around modeling lessons for students and
limited time for mentoring have been documented elsewhere
(see, for example, Hagger & McIntyre, 2006; Kiggundu &
Nayimuli, 2009; Leshem, 2012; Mukeredzi & Mandrona,
2013).
Concomitantly, while all SGs had developmental experi-
ences, SGs 1, 3, and 4 also reported nondevelopmental expe-
riences citing among others limited mentor availability, and
an awareness of the mentors' lack of confidence and feelings
of vulnerability as problematic. SG1 reported,
He kept on dodging playing hide and seek. He seemingly felt
that he would be "judged" and was apologetic of his teaching.
After one lesson that I observed he said: "That wasn't my best
performance, I wasn't well prepared."
SG3 also gave this example:
My NS mentor said she was nervous. I reassured her to relax and
teach as she normally did, and I told her that I am only there to
learn and not critique her teaching.
SG4 also pointed out that observing some mentor lessons
provided knowledge of what not to do:
She was teaching isiZulu. I observed a discipline strategy that I will
never use. Learners who didn't do homework were sent outside
then pinched under the arm as they re-entered one-by-one.
The above comments by SG1, SG3, and SG4 clearly illus-
trate once again that the mentor­mentee relationship was not
constructedasajourney(Awayaetal.,2003).Notwithstanding
the above nondevelopmental experiences, all SGs also
recorded developmental experiences around demonstration
lessons. The following excerpts illustrate,
She demonstrated word problems which excited them.
Explanations were clear and questions posed to their level.
Where learners gave wrong answers, she encouraged them to
try. I saw that knowing and supporting learners and encouraging
them gives them confidence to participate. (SG1)
The lesson was lively and learner-centered. They all actively
participated and he shared jokes here and there. I realized that
relaxes learners, and also breaking down concepts helps learners
to understand. (SG2)
She wrote the day's topic on the chalkboard, gave lesson
objectives and then recapped the previous lesson. A few learners
raised their hands and seeing this, she picked on those with
hands down but amazingly their answers were correct. I learnt
that all learners should be involved. (SG5)
The evidence above illustrates that students draw huge ben-
efits from observing key examples of the art of teaching
when it occurs in the real world. The mentor as a source of
practical knowledge and wisdom can point to key elements
during the preobservation conference, such as lesson struc-
ture, learner activities, discussion styles, and so on, which
themes could form the basis of discussion in the postlesson
observation conference.
Collaboration
Four MGs reported developmental experiences through col-
laboration which suggests mentoring constructed as a jour-
ney, and equality in the relationship (Awaya et al., 2003).
Such relationships often offer students a more positive per-
sonal field experience. These MGs suggested that collabora-
tive mentoring enabled them to encourage students to come
forward with ideas, to prove their worth and demonstrate
their capabilities at all stages of the journey while prompting
them into trial and error to expand their knowledge and skills
(Awaya et al., 2003). However, collaboration does benefit
not only preservice teachers but also mentors. Mentors may
know more about classroom procedures and operations,
while students may have new teaching pedagogies which
may offer mentors deeper insights into their own teaching
through joint planning, teaching, and reflection. MG2 said,
Observing students gave me opportunities to watch other people
teaching. I saw my learners who never participated actively
engaging. During feedback we discussed ways to further
encourage active learner involvement and participation. This
would not have happened without me observing his lesson.
We gained new knowledge on teaching styles. Meetings helped
us learn from each other and the joint planning, materials
development, teaching and marking made us more open-minded
and willing to learn. We began to understand each other, what
students knew or did not know so as to prepare interventions.
(MG3)
Having them made us professionally grow. Mentoring is more
than one-time conversation, but on-going engagement in students'
professional growth, continuous support and encouragement in
their activities, and withdrawing to see what they can do on their
own. (MG4)
The mentors' comments imply equality in the relationship,
mutuality, and learning from each other, which is not based on
the mentor's rank or greater expertise, experience, and wis-
dom (Awaya et al., 2003). Jointly devising ways of active
learner involvement reflects co-learning and enquiry-oriented
collaboration. Comments by MG3 also portray students as
sources of knowledge around teaching styles, and making
mentors open-minded, understanding and willing to learn.
MG4 highlights encouragement, breathing vigor into the men-
tee to forge into appropriate action, and urging them forward
10 SAGE Open
to meet new challenges without interfering directly in the
action but standing back to let them demonstrate their capa-
bilities which builds their confidence (Awaya et al., 2003).
Students' (five SGs) reports of collaborative experiences
reflect the value they placed on good relationships with their
mentors. They stressed the importance of a supportive one-to-
one relationship, being listened to and accepted. SG3 explained,
The best thing he did was to sit down and listen to me. He always
made me feel that what I said was worthwhile. Our interactions
were always fulfilling, he accepted my ideas and supported me
in my trial and error with methods.
Other SG4 also commented,
We hold meetings daily to plan and also strategize for the
following week but they expect us to have ideas or suggestions
while they ask guiding questions. Jaah, we learn from each other
not undermine one another.
Evidence generally shows mentor­mentee collaboration. The
mentor is represented as offering emotional support and guid-
ance on practical knowledge, portraying collaboration aimed
at guiding action, urging them forward, and focusing on par-
ticular immediate student needs of the moment (Awaya et al.,
2003). Students were supported to see and work through their
challenges and consider new solutions to addressing them.
Although, broadly, collaboration was developmental to both
mentors and mentees, SG5 also reported nondevelopmental
experiences. They gave this following example:
My Grade 9 mentor looked for me to teach but he was always
dodging from being observed himself. I went in to teach that
lesson and he came in and sat there playing with his cellphone,
laughing and mocking me while I disciplined learners without
even paying attention to give me advice afterwards.
Aderibigbe (2013), du Plessis (2013), and Heeralal and
Bayaga (2011) report ineffective mentoring relations where
mentors exhibited unprofessional behavior like taking
advantage of students, not gainfully observing them, or mod-
eling lessons for them to enhance their professional learning
experiences. Such unprofessional behavior contradicts
expected mentor responsibilities where mentoring is viewed
as a professional journey; the mentor guiding, nurturing, and
supporting mentee growth; offering them practical knowl-
edge and wisdom (Awaya et al., 2003); appraising them on
shortcomings and strengths; and encouraging them as they
develop abilities to prepare and deliver effective lessons
(Mukeredzi, 2009). In the absence of such supports, stressful
and threatening situations often arise.
Discussion and Implications
The study investigated mentoring experiences of mentors
and students in a cohort model of TP in a rural school. Results
show experiences around four aspects: professional support,
lesson observations and feedback, collaboration, and model-
ing. Although there were nondevelopmental experiences
related to unequal relationships and lesson modeling, the
overall impression given by both mentors and preservice
teachers was positive.
With regard to professional support, students' descrip-
tions of mentoring experiences covered the pragmatics of
classroom pedagogies. Mentors emerged as a source of wis-
dom being supportive, always willing to help and sharing
their knowledge, skills, and experiences of professional
practice. This suggests construction of mentor­entee rela-
tionship as a journey. Awaya et al. (2003) view a mentor as a
guide to practical knowledge, a mouthpiece of wisdom, who
points mentee in the right direction to realize new paths to
solutions, while targeting immediate needs--the "here" and
"now" issues. However, some students (four) were unhappy
with the welcome and introductions, and lack of open com-
munication by their mentors. These mentors introduced the
students as their assistants who were like school students
they were teaching. Such introductions clearly negated
equality in the mentor­mentee relationship as advocated by
Awaya et al. (2003). Mukeredzi (2009) establishes that stu-
dents appreciated being respected, accepted, regarded as col-
leagues, and made to feel welcome in the school. Of
importance to students in this study was seemingly the need
to be accepted as a person, a teacher, and a part of the teach-
ing profession. Stanulis and Russell (2000) note that students
often feel "vulnerable" and "exposed" during placement. It is
therefore vital that mentors are people whom they feel they
can trust. Awaya et al. (2003) indicate that a mentor should
act as a mentee advocate/mouthpiece, their source of moral
support who offers encouragement, and not one who threat-
ens their morale and diminishes their courage. Open conver-
sations and communication in mentoring make the most
significant and integral components in learning to teach as
this enables "jumping in" (Stanulis & Russell, 2000).
"Jumping in" is the willingness to take risks, to be involved
and to immerse oneself in acts of teaching to maximize learn-
ing opportunities for the other person.
Mentors viewed mentoring broadly, expressing that work-
ing with students provided valuable developmental experi-
ences. The very presence of students rejuvenated them and
stimulated reflection on and enthusiasm in their practice. The
term enthusiasm is used in instruction to connote a motivat-
ing, energetic, passionate, and dynamic teaching style (Zhang,
2014). Teacher enthusiasm is critical in holding learners'
attention, generating interest, and developing positive atti-
tudes toward learning. Enthusiastic teachers reflect on their
performance, are open to new learning to accommodate and
further develop effective teaching and learning pedagogies
(Zhang, 2014). They share their skills and knowledge and
whenever they observe other teachers, they identify practices
which are worth emulating (Zhang, 2014). All these crucial
qualities were observed in some of the mentors in this study.
Mukeredzi 11
Both mentors and students acknowledged lesson observa-
tions and feedback sessions as a major source of teaching
knowledge. Students revealed that they needed honest and
objective feedback which highlighted how far they were get-
ting "it" right or wrong so that they would uphold the "right"
and address the "wrong." Mentors regarded feedback ses-
sions intellectual dialogues which promoted students' reflec-
tion and learning from own practice. They reported provision
of continuous and undifferentiated feedback, emphasizing
immediacy and frequency in feeding-back drawing on pre-
service teachers'individualities. The lesson observations and
feedback meetings support Awaya et al.'s (2003) understand-
ing of mentoring as a journey toward self-discovery and ini-
tiation into their life (teaching) role. Sessions promoted
students'reflection and learning through the practical knowl-
edge and wisdom of their mentors. Mentors are well posi-
tioned to give critical developmental feedback due to their
greater and more intimate knowledge of the relevant contex-
tual factors (Hagger & McIntyre, 2006). As on-spot teacher
educators, mentors can monitor on daily basis students'skills
development to praise improvements and reinforce attention
to neglected aspects (Mukeredzi & Mandrona, 2013).
However, one MG did not give objective and honest feed-
back. The MG revealed that they felt insecure in feeding-
back and consequently discussed only strengths, overlooking
weaknesses to avoid "hurting students." Such mentoring
practices contradict notions of mentoring as a journey of ini-
tiation into preservice teacher's professional role in life as
viewed by Awaya et al. (2003). Such mentoring insecurities,
fears and a lack of mentoring confidence could be minimized
or even dispelled by comprehensive and prolonged mentor
training with follow-up and support. If mentor training is
implemented effectively, it may eventually become a natural
aspect of teachers' repertoire of mentoring skills.
Pre-service teachers valued feedback for developing their
classroom practice. They found it vital for understanding
classroom pedagogies and obtaining guidance on how to
improve their teaching performance. Some indicated devel-
opment of confidence from positive comments and encour-
agement, but emphasized the need for honest and objective
constructive feedback. From Awaya et al.'s (2003) perspec-
tive, such mentors would be providing wise counsel and
encouragement, accelerating mentees into apt action--
"confidence building." Essentially, mentors should monitor
students' professional learning, giving them accurate and
objective feedback. Again, weaknesses need tactful positive
discussion as positively offered feedback not only provides
more information than negatively expressed one but also
strengthens a student's motivation and self-esteem (Hagger
& McIntyre, 2006).
However, five students experienced nondevelopmental
feedback citing mentors who were "nice" without feeding-
back, were overcritical and overly negative, or performed
last moment technical compliance mentoring. All these
behaviors are in contradiction of Awaya et al.'s (2003)
themes that inform effective mentoring: mentor­mentee
relationship as a journey, guiding mentee on practical knowl-
edge, offering them moral support, and making for equality
in the relationship. A number of issues may have been at play
and I must acknowledge possible intersecting factors that
may have contributed to the mentors' behavior which prob-
ably influenced the mentoring process. For instance, students
may not experience effective mentoring if mentors them-
selves experienced problematic mentoring, given that much
of what teachers do or do not do is in response to early learn-
ing influences (Allender & Allender, 2006). Again, these
teachers may not have taken up the mentoring role volun-
tarily. Mentor selection was done by the school, based on
subject specializations, and some may not have fully com-
prehended the true nature of mentoring. Furthermore, these
mentors were exposed to a 1-day university mentor training
workshop which may have been inadequate given the com-
plexity of knowledge exchange between mentors and men-
tees required for effective mentoring. However, ineffective
mentoring noted in this study supports observations by the
South African Department of Education (DoE) where inef-
fective in-school supervisory and mentoring support in the
South African education context were hindering the success
of on-site initial teacher education (DoE, 2006). Limited stu-
dent mentoring in South African schools has also been
observed (see, for example, Heeralal & Bayaga, 2011;
Kiggundu & Nayimuli, 2009; Mukeredzi, 2009; Mukeredzi
& Mandrona, 2013).
Ineffective mentoring as alluded to above could be mini-
mized by long-term mentor training coupled with close mon-
itoring, support, and some pressure and coercion. Monitoring
will enable timely corrective measures and guidance. A com-
bination of support and pressure is essential for continuing
learning improvement (Ambrosetti & Dekkers, 2010).
Support may allow those in problematic mentoring situations
to tolerate the anxiety of those challenges through encour-
agement, motivation, and occasional nudging that many
practitioners often require to persist in challenging tasks
often inherent in mentoring. Pressure or coercion is often
vital in initiating attitudinal shift among teachers whose self-
impetus for change may be minimal.
Furthermore, addressing in-school supervisory and men-
toring support requires a forum where all partnership mem-
bers (university, school, and DoE) reexamine, rebuild/
strengthen, or reconstitute and revitalize the partnership
(Edwards & Mutton, 2007). This may enable reidentification
of mutual goals which may include among others student
teacher mentoring and promote creation of sustainable com-
munication systems across all levels (e.g., between school
and partners, with DoE and within the school). Such a pro-
cess may rebuild/strengthen a sense of trust among all stake-
holders, ensuring that all members of the partnership share a
common vision. Again, this may give rise to developing
strategies to offer mentors greater exposure to mentoring
practices and school-based supports through comprehensive
12 SAGE Open
ongoing mentor training referred to above to better equip
them to support not only student teachers but also novice
teachers. The content of such training may include: equality
in mentoring relationships, mentoring as a process; mentor
roles and provision of mentee feedback, practical knowledge
and moral support including ways of offering mentee space.
This may optimize school-based education of preservice
teachers, and promote school students' learning outcomes
while enhancing the professional growth of both school and
university staff.
The lack of regular meetings, consultations, and fre-
quent interactions of partnership stakeholders that was
apparent in this study support findings by Brady (2002),
Edwards and Mutton (2007), and Robinson (2016) who
noted an absence of platforms to encourage stronger part-
nership relations, universities expecting schools to do
more than they could manage, communication either non-
existent or tending to be procedural, and with almost no
evidence of deeper dialogues. Until teacher educators,
DoE, and schools engage in serious and committed discus-
sions around student school-based professional supports,
the possibility of significant improvements in this regard is
unlikely.
Both mentors and students reported experiences around
modeling. Most students (three SGs) commented that men-
tors modeled effective teaching and they viewed lesson
modeling as a valuable experience. From Awaya et al.'s
(2003) conception, lesson modeling relates to the mentor as
guide to practical action and knowledge where the mentee
observes live approaches to address issues and challenges,
and also to realize new classroom strategies and solutions.
Facilitating lesson observation opportunities for students is
a vital and effective instructional strategy which often opens
the mentor's thought processes for the mentee to observe. In
utilizing this instructional approach, mentors often engage
trainees in the imitation of particular professional behaviors
that encourage learning. However, role modeling was
regarded a demanding responsibility if mentors "had to
practice what they preach." For some, the very presence of
students improved their professional practice around lesson
preparation and delivery as well as their deportment and
punctuality. Mentors should portray role models of thought-
ful, enquiring teachers, aware of implications of their
actions, and who seek to further their own understanding of
classroom pedagogies (du Plessis, 2013; Mukeredzi &
Mandrona, 2013). In modeling good teaching, mentors
make students "see" what is important, what could further
be improved, and understand rationales involved (Hagger &
McIntyre, 2006). Most mentors (four MGs) portrayed some
of these qualities, while others, due to lack of confidence,
deliberately avoided modeling lessons. Awaya et al. (2003)
point out that mentors should share and demonstrate to the
mentee conceptions of and aims for teaching, always striv-
ing to create supporting challenges that push--breathe vigor
into the protégé.
Collaboration enhances both students' and mentors' pro-
fessional development and significantly reduces a sense of
isolation among teachers (du Plessis, 2013). In the current
study, collaboration in lesson delivery offered mentors new
teaching styles and effective ways of engaging learners.
Mentors indicated that joint lesson preparation, teaching, and
assessment created openness to learning and better knowl-
edge of preservice teachers. From the MGs, it appears col-
laboration was based on friendship, mutuality, and equality
in the relationship and co-learning, without foregrounding
the mentor's rank but greater experience and wisdom (Awaya
et al., 2003). Two MGs foregrounded "confidence building"
and an awareness of when to stand back and give the preser-
vice teachers space to show off their capabilities. This aligns
with what Awaya et al. (2003) regard as knowing when to
provide space and let the protégé show off their worth, por-
traying their true version and exhibiting that they are made of
the "right stuff." Often the dynamic is knowing when to
"jump in" and when to stand back. Mentors should guide
without taking control of the mentee's actions, but allow
them space to show-off what they are made of.
From the SGs while there was mentor­mentee collabora-
tion which was aimed at building what Awaya et al. (2003)
call "equality in the relationship," the preservice teachers'
comments generally portray the mentor's dominant role,
suggesting unequal relationships. Awaya et al. indicate that
where there is equality, there is caring and friendship and,
authority in the relationship is based on experience and wis-
dom notwithstanding mentor's rank or organizational level.
This was seemingly not the case. Effective mentoring exists
in contexts where the relationship is underpinned by a part-
nership in which neither party holds power over the other or
one disregards their position of power; where mutuality is a
critical feature; and where equality can be achieved between
all participants (Awaya et al., 2003). Three students did not
experience collaboration with some of their mentors as those
mentors did not make time for mentoring them. This behav-
ior contradicts views of mentoring as a journey in which the
mentor is a guide and a source of practical wisdom and sup-
port, who constantly and appropriately breathes vigor into
their mentee, urging them frontward to face new situations,
without direct interference in their action, but only encour-
agement into apt action--"confidence building" (Awaya
et al., 2003). Mentor­mentee collaboration has been recog-
nized as vital for developing teacher professional knowledge
and skills (Aderibigbe, 2013; Hagger & McIntyre, 2006;
Kiggundu & Nayimuli, 2009). Again, genuine collaboration
also exists where all participants feel safe to reveal their vul-
nerabilities to enable learning, and is driven by honest and
professionally supportive mentor­mentee interactions in an
environment where even mentors also feel safe to put them-
selves "out there" to help preservice teachers to learn
(Aderibigbe, 2013). It may be that for some mentors, the
mentor­mentee environment was not conducive for reveal-
ing their vulnerabilities.

Conclusion
The study explored mentoring experiences of mentors and stu-
dentteachersduringa4-weekresidentialpracticum.Experiences
revolved around professional support, lesson observations and
feedback, mentor modeling lessons, and collaboration. With
regard to professional support, students'descriptions of mentor-
ing covered the pragmatics of classroom strategies. All, except
three students who did not receive mentoring because their
mentors did not make time for them, portrayed mentors as a
source of practical knowledge and wisdom, who supported their
classroom practice and were always willing to assist and share
knowledge, skills, and experiences of professional practice.
Notwithstanding the professional support, four students were
dismayed by the way they were introduced to pupils and, the
absence of open communicate with them suggesting some over-
sights on how we learn to become teachers.
Both mentors and students hailed lesson observations and
feedback sessions as a key source of teaching knowledge.
Preservice teachers viewed feedback as vital for understand-
ing and developing the art of classroom pedagogies, and
receiving guidance to foster their teaching performance.
Some developed confidence from positive appraisal, encour-
agement, and constructive feedback. However, students
revealed that they preferred truthful and impartial mentors
who highlight both strengths and weaknesses so that they
uphold strengths and work on weaknesses. Some of the men-
tors were "nice" without feeding-back, overcritical, and/or
performed compliance mentoring. This type of behavior did
not portray mentor­mentee relationship as a "journey of ini-
tiation into one's life role, as a teacher."
Mentors saw feedback conferences as intellectual inter-
changes which promoted preservice teacher reflection and
learning from own practice. Mentors indicated that they were
able to offer continuous and undifferentiated feedback,
emphasizing propinquity and frequency in feeding-back
drawing on students' individualities. However, one MG con-
fessed lack of objectivity in feeding-back highlighting fear
and insecurity consequently, only discussing strengths,
avoiding weaknesses as they would "hurt students." Such
practice contradicts the views of mentoring as a journey
where the mentor provides guidance on practical knowledge,
morally supporting their mentee, and urging them forward.
Concerning modeling, all SGs indicated that mentors
modeled effective teaching which was beneficial and infor-
mative as they were exposed to key examples of the art of
teaching "in the real world." However, the other three SGs
also reported nondevelopmental experiences citing among
others mentor unavailability, lacking confidence, and portray-
ing feelings of vulnerability. The MGs that modeled lessons
revealed that it was demanding, but admitted that the very
presence of students improved their professional practice, les-
son preparation, and delivery behaviors as well as their pro-
fessional deportment and punctuality in their efforts to make
students "see" what is important. The one group that admitted
failure to model lessons professed a lack of confidence and
fear that students would view them as possessing inadequate
subject content knowledge. These mentors did not regard
mentoring as a journey into one's professional role and did
not understand the relationship as equal-collegial.
SGs valued collaboration and good relations with their
mentors and further esteemed the supportive one-to-one rela-
tionship including specific professional needs that their men-
tors helped them address. Others indicated fulfillment from
collaborations, being listened to, having their ideas accepted
and enacted, and receiving encouragement for experimenting
with pedagogies. Mentors testified that collaboration offered
them opportunities to watch other people teach, from where
they gained new knowledge on teaching styles and effective
ways of learner engagement and discipline. They confirmed
learning from each other which made them more understand-
ing, open-minded, and willing to learn. Their enthusiasm,
reflection-on-practice, morale, and passion for their work
grew which improved their teaching and enhanced their pro-
fessional growth. Mentors also confirmed that this would not
have happened without mentor­mentee collaborations. The
MG that did not speak highly about collaboration pointed out
that the entire mentoring process was stressful and caused
fear and anxiety as they were unable to make time for it.
On the overall, while most mentors in this study seemingly
understood mentoring as a process, a journey of student
teacher initiation into their professional life, the mentor­men-
tee relationship was not constructed as equal. Mentoring is not
a natural activity, which requires making all aspects of teach-
ing processes visible, breaking down all teaching approaches
into step-by-step instruction for students (Mukeredzi &
Mandrona, 2013). This implies a need for more time to focus
on mentor­mentee practices, meetings, setting expectations
and guidelines collaboratively, and addressing concerns of
various aspects such as modeling and observing lessons.
Perhaps achievement of mentoring effectiveness may be
enhanced through strengthening these school-university
partnerships, addressing, for instance, issues around specific
roles of the mentor, guidelines and expectations regarding
mentoring time, and how the university, school, and DoE can
collaboratively address these. The 1-day mentor training
workshop was seemingly inadequate as there appeared to be
a lack of clarity regarding mentor terms of reference. Again,
there seemingly was no forum to discuss concerns and
encourage/strengthen the partnership. There is need for the
tripartite group to engage in serious and committed discus-
sions around school-based supports for student teacher TP,
otherwise significant change in this regard may not be pos-
sible as mentors may continue to pay lip-service to mentor-
ing of preservice teachers.

Note
1. Many DVD movies often turn on the director's commentary for
viewers to hear what went into making the film as highlighting
details might be very difficult to comprehend. Likewise, good
mentors can keep a running commentary track ongoing for stu-
dent teachers, to help prevent them from uncritically copying
what mentors do, rather than focus attention on the mentor's
underlying goals. It is also a way to share practical wisdom.
