Abstract
Background and aims: The aim of this study was to explore ethnic differences in demographic and
socioeconomic determinants of poor physical and mental self-rated health (SRH) in the United States.
Methods: We used data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) 2001-
2003, which included a national household probability sample of 18
237 individuals including
520 Vietnamese, 508 Filipino, 600 Chinese, 656 other Asian, 577 Cuban, 495 Puerto Rican, 1442
Mexican, 1106 other Hispanic, 4746 African American, and 7587 non-Latino Whites. Demographic
factors (age and gender), socioeconomic factors (education and income), body mass index (BMI),
and physical and mental SRH were measured. Pearson correlation was used to explore correlates of
physical and mental SRH across ethnic groups.
Results: While age was positively associated with poor physical SRH, ethnic groups differed in the
effect of age on mental SRH. Age was positively associated with mental SRH among Vietnamese,
Filipino, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and African American individuals, but this was not so for other
Asians, Mexicans, other Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites. Chinese and Cubans were the only
groups where female gender was associated with poor physical and mental SRH. With other Asians
being an exception, education and income were protective against poor physical and mental SRH in
all ethnic groups. Ethnic groups also differed in how their mental and physical SRH reflect BMI.
Conclusion: Demographic and socioeconomic determinants of physical and mental SRH vary across
ethnic groups. Poor physical and mental SRH are differently shaped by social determinants across
ethnic groups. These ethnic differences may cause bias in health measurement in ethnically diverse
populations.

Introduction
Single-item measures of self-rated health (SRH)
providebrief andcost-effectivemethodsforestimating
the health of populations in epidemiology.1-5 Following
recommendation by the Institute of Medicine (IOM),
single-item measures of SRH are being used as a tool
to monitor the health of the US population.6-8 Single-
item physical and mental SRH9 predict a wide range of
health outcomes, such as utilization of health care,10,11
development of chronic medical conditions,1,2,12-14 and
mortality.15
Perceived poor health (poor SRH) prompts a
complex cognitive process that is required for health
care utilization.16,17 While a wide range of psychosocial
factors such as awareness, trust, stigma, access,
and insurance influence health care utilization,18
individuals would not seek help unless they perceive
their own health as poor.10,15-22 Given the critical role
of SRH in the process of health care use,23 there is a
need to better understand what physical and mental
SRH actually measure across ethnic groups.12,25-29 The
degree by which SRH reflects psychological distress25
and chronic medical and mental disorders1,2,12-14 may
differ from one ethnic group to another.30-36
The meaning and determinants of SRH are not
universal, but population specific.12,26,28 Factors
associated with SRH also vary across diverse ethnic
groups.30-36 As a general rule, poor SRH better reflects
health problems in non-Hispanic Whites compared
to all ethnic minorities such as Blacks, Hispanics,

and Asians.12 Poor SRH also better predicts mortality
in Whites than non-Whites.30 Even within a single
racial group, ethnicity changes how SRH correlates
with health problems.28,31 However, very few studies
have investigated the heterogeneity of demographic
and social determinants of physical and mental SRH
across ethnic groups.
This study compared 10 ethnic groups for
demographic and social determinants of physical and
mental SRH in the United States.
Methods
Design and Setting
This cross-sectional study was a secondary analysis of
the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys
(CPES), 2001 to 2003, composed of the National
Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), the
National Survey of American Life (NSAL), and the
National Comorbidity Survey ­ Replication (NCS-R).
All of these surveys are representative of the US
ethnic and racial groups and have employed similar
methodologies such as utilizing trained lay-interviewers
to conduct interviews primarily in-person. Data were
collected by the Institute for Social Research (ISR),
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Study design and
sampling have been described in detail previously.37
Participants
The NCS-R sampled 9282 individuals, the NSAL
sampled 6082 individuals, and the NLAAS sampled
4649 individuals. This study included a national
household probability sample of 18
237 individuals
including 520 Vietnamese, 508 Filipino, 600 Chinese,
656 other Asian, 577 Cuban, 495 Puerto Rican, 1442
Mexican, 1106 other Hispanic, 4746 African American,
and 7587 non-Latino Whites. All participants were
adults (aged 18 or older). Participants were either
American or immigrants in the United States.
Interview
Most interviews were face-to-face and were conducted
within participants' homes. The rest of the interviews
were conducted using telephone interviews. The
average response rate in the CPES was 72.7%.
Measures
Physical and Mental Self-Rated Health. Participants were
asked "How would you rate your overall physical/
mental health - excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor?" Responses included five categories: excellent,
very good, good, fair, and poor. Single-item SRH
measures have shown strong correlation with multi-
item health measures.38 Single-item SRH also predicts
mortality, net of demographics, socioeconomic status
(SES), and medical risk factors.15 Test-retest reliability
for single-item SRH measures is high.38 These measures
also show strong correlations with standard scales on
distress and well-being.38
Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors. Demographic
factors included age (continuous measure) and
gender (dichotomous measure, male as the reference
category). The study also measured 2 socioeconomic
indicators, namely education level (less than high
school [reference category], high school graduate,
some college, and college graduate) and income
(continuous measure).
Body Mass Index (BMI) Class. The CPES measured
BMI level based on self-reported weight and height.
Weight and height were collected in pounds (1 pound
= 0.453 kilograms) and feet (1 foot = 0.3048 meters)
/ inches (1 inch = 0.0254 meters), respectively. Using
the thresholds of equal to or larger than 25, 30, 35,
and 40 kg/m2, BMI class was categorized as under-
weight, normal weight, obesity class I, obesity class
II, and obesity class III. Although self-reported BMI
underestimates actual BMI,39 BMI calculated based on
self-reported weight and height is closely correlated
with BMI based on direct measures of height and
weight.39
Statistical Analysis
As CPES has used a complex sampling design, we
used Stata version 13.0 (Stata Corp., College Station,
TX, USA) for data analysis. Standard errors were
estimated using the Taylor series approximation. We
performed Pearson correlation coefficients within
each ethnic group. Mental and physical SRH were
both treated as continuous measures, with a higher
score indicating worse condition. P values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
From the 18237 participants in this study, 7587 (42%
of the total sample) were non-Hispanic Whites, while
the remaining 10650 individuals belonged to an ethnic
minority. Following non-Hispanic Whites, there were
4746 African American individuals (26% of the total
sample). Table 1 summarizes the sample size for each
ethnic group.
Descriptive Statistics
Table 2 provides a summary of characteristics across
each ethnic group. Mental SRH was measured as better
in Other Asians compared to non-Latino Whites and
African Americans.

Correlates of Physical and Mental Self-rated Health
Table 3 provides a summary of the correlation matrix
between demographics, SES, and physical and mental
SRH across ethnic groups. As shown in this table,
while age was positively associated with poor physical
SRH in all ethnic groups, ethnic groups differed in
the effect of age on mental SRH. Age was positively
associated with mental SRH among Vietnamese,
Filipino, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto Rican, and African
American individuals, but not among other Asians,
Mexicans, other Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites
(Table 3).
Chinese and Cubans were the only groups where
gender was associated with poor physical and mental
SRH. With Other Asians being the only exception,
education and income were associated with physical
and mental SRH in all ethnic groups (Table 3).
Ethnic groups differed in how their mental and
physical SRH reflect their BMI (Table 3).
Discussion
Major and systematic ethnic differences were found in
demographic and social determinants of physical and
mental SRH in the United States population. While
age was positively associated with poor physical SRH,
ethnic groups differed in the effect of age on mental
SRH. Age was positively associated with mental SRH
among Vietnamese, Filipino, Chinese, Cuban, Puerto
Rican, and African American individuals, but not
among other Asians, Mexicans, other Hispanics, and
non-Hispanic Whites. Chinese and Cubans were the
only groups where female gender was associated with
poor physical and mental SRH. Education and income
were protective against poor physical and mental
SRH in all ethnic groups, with Other Asians being
an exception. Our findings also suggest that ethnic
groups differed in how their mental and physical SRH
reflect high BMI.

Both meaning and determinants of physical and
mental SRH may be specific to ethnic groups. Our
findings are also consistent with previous research
which has documented major ethnic differences in the
associations between mental and physical SRH and
psychiatric disorders.12,26,28 It is still not clear how poor
physical and mental SRH reflect the past, current,
and future health needs of individuals from diverse
backgrounds.25,29 Still, there is a need for additional
research on ethnic differences on how demographics,
SES, and health factors shape SRH.40-53
Our finding has implications for clinical and public
health practice. Based on these results, sole reliance
on single-item SRH measures will result in bias across
ethnically diverse population, as SRH is differently
influenced by social and medical determinants across
groups.32,54,55 Thus, single item physical and mental
SRH measures are not ideal tools for the measurement
of health disparities across ethnic groups.56 Using
SRH items to screen individuals with a need for health
care may also result in the enrollment of a population
with heterogenic health care needs. Currently, physical
and mental SRH items are being used as screening
tools to detect individuals at high risk.57,58 Combining
single-item SRH measures with other measures is
recommended,atleastinethnicallydiversepopulations.
Our findings advocate for designing more accurate
screening tools for the screening of health problems
in ethnically diverse populations. Although still useful
information to assess, poor physical and mental SRH
does not universally reflect demographic and SES
status across all ethnic groups.
Thefindingsreportedhereemphasizethecomplexity
and non-linear association between ethnicity,
demographic factors, socioeconomics, and SRH.12
Different ethnic groups differ in how they perceive and
interpret health or illness, which influences their health
care use. Similarly, SES status may differently shape
SRH of ethnic groups.28 There is a present need for
the creation of health measures that are comparable
across ethnic groups. Before then, SRH items should
be carefully used as a tool for comparison of health
status across ethnic groups. It is still unclear why
demographic and SES differently shape the SRH of
different ethnic groups, and whether this variation is
biological or social.59-63 Ethnic groups differ in biology,
as well as historical life experiences, knowledge, SES,
values, cognitive styles,59-69 emotion processing,70,71
regulation,64-69 and culture,72-82 all of which can shape
our perception of health and illness.
The study is not free of limitations. First, due to its
cross-sectional design, findings should be interpreted
as associations not causations. Second, the sample

size was not balanced across groups. Third, validity
of mental and physical SRH may depend on ethnicity.
Fourth, a number of confounders such as nativity,
immigration status, and number of years in the United
States were not included in this study. Fifth, we did
not use multivariable analysis, due to the exploratory
design of this study. Sixth, single-item SRH measures
are sensitive to the contextual effects of preceding
questions in survey instruments, which vary across
CPES surveys.38 Finally, we did not measure social
desirabilityorcurrenthealthstatusinthisstudy.Despite
all these limitations, using nationally representative data
and a large sample size were 2 major strengths of the
current secondary analysis. To conclude, demographic
and socioeconomic determinants of physical and
mental SRH vary across ethnic groups. Poor physical
and mental SRH are differently shaped by social
determinants across ethnic groups. These ethnic
differences may cause bias in health measurement in
ethnically diverse populations.
