The Family Contribution to Health Status:
A Population-Level Estimate
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Clinical studies have shown strong family influences on individual
health, but the aggregate importance of family effects for population health is
unknown. Our objective was to estimate, at a population level, the variance in
individual health status attributable to the family.
METHODS Secondary data were used from the Community Tracking Study, a strat-
ified random sample of the US population. Hierarchical linear modeling was used
to estimate the individual and family components of health status. The setting was
60 US communities, which account for approximately one half of the population.
Participants were US residents aged 18 years and older who shared a household
with family members in the study (N = 35,055). Main outcome measures were
the Short Form-12 (SF-12) self-reported physical and mental subscales.
RESULTS Depending on the family configuration, 4.5% to 26.1% of the variance
in individual health status was derived from the family. The proportion was high-
est for older married persons. The family effect on health status was generally
similar for physical and mental health. Including age, family income, and health
insurance status in the regression equations moderately reduced the family vari-
ance component.
CONCLUSIONS At a population level, the family contribution to individual health
status is measurable and substantial. The shared characteristics of income and
health insurance account for only a modest portion of the effect. Health policy
and interventions should place more emphasis on the family's role in health.

INTRODUCTION
Since its publication in 1977, George Engel's biopsychosocial model
has provided the conceptual underpinning for family medicine and
other primary care disciplines.1 Writing in response to the biomedi-
cal reductionism that had taken hold in mainstream medicine, Engel
underlined the importance of understanding health and illness in a multi-
level context. The contribution of the biopsychosocial model has been to
emphasize the embeddedness of each person in a continuum of hierarchies
from the molecular to the societal and the role that each level of organiza-
tion plays in determining health outcomes. Despite its theoretical power,
however, the complexity of the biopsychosocial model has made it difficult
to test empirically in a multilevel framework.
Nevertheless, a large body of research has addressed both family
and community influences on health. Family-level influences on health
derive from 3 main sources: genetics, a shared physical environment, and
a shared social environment.2 The last 2 factors become more important
when family members inhabit the same household. The shared social
environment includes functional relationships, such as caregiving; shared
socioeconomic circumstances, such as income and wealth, that are linked
to barriers and opportunities for healthy living; and shared relationships,

FAMILY CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH STATUS
both positive and negative. Family effects have been
identified for a wide variety of specific health out-
comes in both adults and children.3-10 In addition, a
growing body of research during the last 2 decades
has demonstrated the effects on individual health out-
comes of community-level characteristics above and
beyond the effect of individual-level variables.11 Mor-
tality, cardiovascular disease, violence, and other out-
comes are influenced by the economic, racial/ethnic,
and social characteristics of neighborhoods and larger
social aggregations.12,13
In this study, we ask a different question: instead of
considering specific disease outcomes for individuals,
we ask what the contextual effects of family and com-
munity on individual health status are at a population
level. That is, across the US population, what propor-
tion of general health status can be attributed to indi-
vidual-, family-, and community-level determinants?
Our intent is not to disentangle the contribution of
specific family and community environmental deter-
minants, but to estimate the public health importance
of the pathways taken as a whole. To our knowledge,
this study is the first to address this question. From a
population or public health perspective, addressing this
question is important to understand the determinants
of illness and well-being and also to inform policy on
health interventions.
METHODS
Data Source
This study is a secondary analysis of data from the
Community Tracking Study (CTS), which was admin-
istered to a stratified random sample of the US popula-
tion between July 1996 and July 1997. Respondents
completed an automated telephone survey; provision
was made to respondents without telephones by allow-
ing them to access the survey by cellular telephone.
Survey questions covered demographics, health insur-
ance, satisfaction with health care, use of health ser-
vices, and health status. The response rate was 65%.
Because only adults completed the health status ques-
tions, we limited our analysis to responses from persons
aged 18 years or older who shared a household with a
spouse or at least 1 child (N = 35,055).
Measures
The health status questions administered included the
Short Form-12 questionnaire (SF-12), a validated health
status instrument with 2 subscales that cover mental
and physical health status.14 The overall SF-12 score is
scaled to have a mean of 50 with a standard deviation
of 10. The physical component summary and mental
component summary scores were used for this study.
The physical component summary scale is constructed
from SF-12 items covering physical limitations, role
functioning, pain, and general health status. The men-
tal component summary scale is constructed from items
on emotional problems, role functioning, and mood.
Analysis
In the CTS data set, 3 nested levels can be used to
define families.15 The most restricted definition, the
family insurance unit, includes an adult head of house-
hold, a spouse (if present), dependent children up to
the age of 18 years who are living in the household, or
children aged 18 to 22 years who are in school even if
they are living elsewhere. A census family, so named
because it most closely corresponds to the definition
used by the Census Bureau, includes all persons related
to the head of household by blood or marriage. Finally,
a household includes all persons residing together.
We chose to use the census family definition for
3 reasons. First, we wanted to include relatives who
shared the residence with the family insurance unit.
Second, because there was no relationship code other
than "spouse" for cohabiting adults, the household defi-
nition had the potential for misclassifying respondents
as family members when they were actually housemates
or boarders. Third, a family-level weight was available
for census families, but not households, thus allowing
more accurate population-level point estimates. We
tested the sensitivity of our analysis to the choice of
household vs census family definition by rerunning the
analysis; the results were nearly identical.
We defined family configurations according to a
CTS-constructed variable that categorized persons as
belonging to 1 of the following family classifications:
"single," "single with kids," "married, no kids," "married
with kids," or "non-nuclear family." The CTS further
subdivided households into single-family households
(84% of households) and multiple-family households
(16%), depending on whether there was more than 1
family insurance unit in the household. Most (55%)
persons in the additional family insurance units within
households were either parents or grandchildren of the
adult head of household. We chose to analyze multiple-
family households separately because we hypothesized
that these varied living arrangements might materially
alter the family environment.
Communities were defined as the 60 CTS sites--
generally cities or aggregations of rural counties.
Although we recognized this definition of community
to be coarse, smaller geographic units were not avail-
able in the public-use data set. We analyzed the indi-
vidual-, family-, and community-level influences on
self-rated health in a hierarchical linear model by using
MLWin (Centre for Multilevel Modelling, London)

software. The hierarchical linear
model accounts for the nested
data structure of individuals
within families and families within
communities.
All analyses applied person-
level and family-level weights
appropriate for making estimates
representative of the nonin-
stitutionalized US population.
Because currently available hier-
archical linear model software
does not account for the design
effect from clustered sampling,
in which the actual variance is
greater than what it would be
under the assumption of simple
random sampling,16 we recom-
puted all standard errors before
calculating statistical significance.
The average design effect across
the CTS variables is 3.7 (ie, the
actual variance is 3.7 times what
it would be if the survey were a
simple random sample),15so we
rechecked statistical significance
after multiplying the estimated
standard errors by 1.92 (the
square root of 3.7).
The Multilevel Model
We used the hierarchical linear
model to examine health status in
individuals, families, and commu-
nities. The individual-level model
(level-1) is a fixed-effects linear
model that predicts health status
for each individual as a function
of the family-specific mean plus
an error term. The family-level
model (level-2) expresses the
family-specific mean as a function of the mean of all
families plus an error term. By substituting the level-2
equation into the level-1 equation, a combined multi-
level model is generated, and a similar procedure gen-
erates the community-level model (level-3).17 Within
the combined model, the variance at each level is cal-
culated and can be used to compute an intraclass corre-
lation coefficient, which, for this study, is equal to the
family-level variance divided by the sum of the indi-
vidual- and family-level variances. It is a measure of the
proportion of the variability in health status between,
rather than within, families.
Our initial analysis used the combined level-3
model to partition the variance of the SF-12 scores into
3 components: individual (level-1), family (level-2),
and community (level-3). Because the community level
accounted for less than 1% of the total variance in
health status scores in initial analyses, however, subse-
quent analyses were limited to the individual (level-1)
and family (level-2) components. The second analysis
was a series of multilevel regression equations that
sequentially added age, family income, and then health
insurance status as predictors of SF-12 scores. For this
set of equations, we were interested in assessing the
proportion of family-level variance accounted for as
each covariate was added to the model.

FAMILY CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH STATUS
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics of the sample and study variables,
including the number and proportion of various family
structures for CTS participants, are shown in Table 1.
The multilevel variance components for the SF-12
physical and mental health summary scores appear in
Tables 2 and 3. The family (level-2) variance compo-
nent ranged from 4.5% to 26.1% for the physical health
score and from 14.1% to 26.1% for the mental health
score. All the level-2 variance components for physi-
cal health were statistically significant except for single
persons with children in multiple-family households.
All the level-2 variance components for mental health
were statistically significant except for single persons
with children in single- or multiple-family households.
The level-2 variance component was generally similar
for mental and physical health status. Level-2 variances
between single- and multiple-family households were
comparable. For this reason, only single-family house-
holds were used in the regression models
In the multilevel regression models, age and income
were significant predictors of
physical health status in all
family configurations (Table
4). The effects were in the
expected direction; older age,
lower income, and lack of
insurance were associated with
worse physical health status.
Age accounted for approxi-
mately 30% of the level-2 vari-
ance for physical health status
in the "married, no kids" group,
reducing the family-level vari-
ance component from 22.3%
to 16.2% of the total variance.
This magnitude of effect was
not observed in the "married
with kids" or the "single with
kids" groups. Adding income to
the regression equations further
reduced the level-2 variance
component by 23% to 60% in
all family configurations. After
adjustment for age and income,
insurance status only slightly
improved the model.
The multilevel regression
models for mental health status
displayed a different pattern
(Table 5). Income remained
a significant predictor in all
family configurations, but age
accounted for a very small
amount of level-2 variation and was significant only
in the "married, no kids" families. Insurance status also
accounted for little of the level-2 variance. Adjustment
for covariates had smaller effects on the level-2 variance
components for mental health than for physical health.
DISCUSSION
At the population level, the contribution of the family
unit to self-rated health status is substantial: the family-
level variance accounts for 4.5% to 26.1% of the total
variance in individual physical and mental health status.
The family-level effect is most pronounced in married
persons without children living in the household, prob-
ably because this group has the oldest average age of
any of the family configurations (56.0 years, vs 36.6
years for "married with kids" and 33.2 years for "single
with kids") and thus contains persons who have had the
longest exposure to the shared family environment. This
hypothesis is supported by the observation that including
age as a covariate in equations predicting health status

substantially reduces the level-2 variance component
for physical health in the "married with kids" group. As
expected, income is an important feature of the family
environment, exerting a measurable independent influ-
ence on the level-2 variance component, whereas insur-
ance status has smaller effects. With our limited number
of predictors, 40% to 80% of the family-level variance
component remains unexplained in our models.
Numerous studies have found family-level effects on
health behaviors and illness. For example, spouses have

FAMILY CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH STATUS
higher odds than age-matched controls for concor-
dance on coronary risk factors; diseases such as asthma,
depression, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and peptic ulcer
disease; and suicide.7-10 These observations strongly sug-
gest that rational clinical services should be designed to
take into account family-level influences. For example,
although the traditional gathering of family history has
emphasized seeking genetic linkages, the strength of
spousal concordance for many chronic diseases empha-
sizes that shared environmental risks are also important;
thus, a spouse's illness profile is useful for predicting risk.
The influence of genetic factors on concordant
health status in this study was probably small for meth-
odologic reasons. Spouses constituted the great major-
ity (87%) of adults whose health status was evaluated
in the multilevel model. Most of the family-level effect,
therefore, derived from shared features of the family
environment rather than from shared genetics. Of note
is that the only nonsignificant level-2 variances were
observed in the subgroup with potentially the closest
genetic relationship--"single with kids"--whose intra-
family correlations were derived mainly from single
parents and their young-adult children. Many of these
children could be assumed to be living outside the
household. The effect of a shared physical environment
and more frequent interactions is thereby lost.
Family environmental factors take many forms,
including mutually practiced health beliefs and behav-
iors, shared physical environments, common stresses
arising from family illnesses or deaths, instrumental
support for obtaining health care, and interpersonal
relations that can be either beneficial or deleterious to
health.18-20 The cumulative population-level effect of
the family environment on health will be determined by
the epidemiology of these family-level factors. One of
the most powerful determinants of family risk (which is
evident in our analysis) is socioeconomic position,21-23
which is generally shared by cohabiting family mem-
bers and which strongly stratifies many nongenetic
risk factors. The effect of socioeconomic position is to
structure a set of life circumstances--quality of housing,
neighborhood conditions, transportation, and access
to medical care--each of which carries health implica-
tions.24,25 Family systems research has documented that
different patterns of family dynamics predict different
health outcomes.26 We do not know, however, how the
epidemiology of family dynamics cumulates into popu-
lation patterns of morbidity and mortality.
With the exceptions of income and health insurance
coverage, this study does not elaborate on the contri-
bution of the various family environmental pathways;
rather, it seeks to estimate the public health importance
of the pathways taken as a whole. By understanding
the relative contributions to health of various levels of
the biopsychosocial continuum, proper weight can be
given to these levels in designing policy and interven-
tions. Although it does not automatically follow that
the solution to a family-level problem has to be applied
at the family level (for instance, spouses concordant
for depression or obesity can individually be offered
behavioral counseling or medication), there may be
fruitful ways to manage common risk for multiple
morbidities in multiple family members through family
interventions; the emphasis on individual clinical care
has impeded exploration of such interventions.
This study is subject to several important limitations.
First is our definition of family. Defining family can be
an elusive task, but a generally accepted definition is a
group of intimates who have a history and a future as a
group.27 Using data from a large epidemiologic study,
we instead had to rely on fixed-category self-reports of
family configurations. Second, we lacked information on
how long respondents had been in their current family
configuration. To the extent that there is a true family
effect, attempting to measure that effect in persons who
have been in a family constellation for brief periods will
underestimate its importance. Third, because the CTS
limited its geographic identifiers in the public-use data set
to the level of cities and counties, our definition of commu-
nity was coarse, and we almost certainly underestimated
the effect of communities (neighborhoods) on health sta-
tus. A robust array of studies has documented pervasive
community-level effects on morbidity and mortality.11,13,28
Fourth, we examined only 1 category of health outcomes
(self-reported health status) and can make no inferences
about the population-level contribution of family to other
important outcomes, such as mortality, functional status,
and specific morbidities. Fifth, assortative mating--the
tendency for people who share traits to form couples--
may account for part of the family effect, although the
lesser family variance component for young couples
suggests that assortative mating has limited explanatory
power for health status. Finally, the amount of variation
attributed to a particular hierarchical level in a multilevel
model does not necessarily predict the strength of the
explanatory variables that operate at that level.29 For
instance, if there were little between-community vari-
ability in health status, then the model would assign little
variance to that level, even though community-level vari-
ables might exert strong effects on health status.
In conclusion, using data from a nationally repre-
sentative US sample, we found a substantial population-
level contribution of the family to health status. With
the availability of multilevel modeling as an analytical
tool, further refinements in the understanding of the
family's role in population health status should follow
and contribute both to the basic science of family prac-
tice and to the development of policy and interventions.
