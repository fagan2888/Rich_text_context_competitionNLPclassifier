Background: Given the rising costs of health care, poli-
cymakers are increasingly interested in identifying the
inefficiencies in our health care system. The objective of
this study was to determine whether the overuse and mis-
use of health care services in the ambulatory setting has
decreased in the past decade.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the 1999 and 2009
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the out-
patient department component of the National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which are nationally
representative annual surveys of visits to non­federally
funded ambulatory care practices. We applied 22 qual-
ity indicators using a combination of current quality mea-
sures and guideline recommendations. The main out-
come measures were the rates of underuse, overuse, and
misuse and their 95% CIs.
Results: We observed a statistically significant improve-
ment in 6 of 9 underuse quality indicators. There was
an improvement in the use of antithrombotic therapy for
atrial fibrillation; the use of aspirin, -blockers, and stat-
ins in coronary artery disease; the use of -blockers in
congestive heart failure; and the use of statins in diabe-
tes mellitus. We observed an improvement in only 2 of
11 overuse quality indicators, 1 indicator became worse,
and 8 did not change. There was a statistically signifi-
cant decrease in the overuse of cervical cancer screen-
ing in visits for women older than 65 years and in the
overuse of antibiotics in asthma exacerbations. How-
ever, there was an increase in the overuse of prostate can-
cer screening in men older than 74 years. Of the 2 mis-
use indicators, there was a decrease in the proportion of
patients with a urinary tract infection who were pre-
scribed an inappropriate antibiotic.
Conclusions: We found significant improvement in the
delivery of underused care but more limited changes in
the reduction of inappropriate care. With the high cost
of health care, these results are concerning.

GIVEN THE RISING COSTS OF
health care, policymak-
ers are increasingly in-
terestedinidentifyingthe
inefficiencies in our
health care system.1 In an analysis of the
estimated $700 billion that is wasted an-
nually in our health care system, over-
use, or the delivery of services for which
the risks exceed the benefits, has been
identified as a significant component,
equaling roughly $280 billion.2 Interest in
overuse has started to gain traction, no-
tably by physician leaders. Several na-
tional physician groups have tackled the
overuse of screening and diagnostic test-
ing, identifying many common scenarios
in which services have low value and high
cost.3,4 Research has confirmed that over-
use is widespread and occurs across mul-
tiple specialties.5,6
Assessments of the current state of our
health care system typically examine 1 of
3 interrelated dimensions of quality: struc-
ture (the characteristics of the resources
of the health care system), process (inter-
actions between clinicians and patients),
and outcomes (changes in patients' health
status).7 Evaluations of process measures
dominate quality improvement because
they are activities that clinicians control
most directly. Process measures can be
further categorized into overuse, under-
use, and misuse. Overuse represents the
delivery of health care for which the risks
outweigh the benefits (eg, use of an anti-
biotic to treat viral respiratory syn-
dromes); underuse represents the failure
to deliver health care for which the ben-
efits outweigh the risks (eg, use of an as-
pirin in patients with coronary disease);
and misuse is the delivery of the wrong care
(eg, use of an antibiotic other than nitro-

lone for the treatment of an uncomplicated urinary tract
infection).
Recent studies8 have demonstrated an improvement
in the underuse of needed medical services; however, it
is unclear whether the rates of misuse and overuse have
also decreased over time. Understanding the relation-
ship of changes in underuse to overuse and misuse helps
to characterize the state of our evolving health care sys-
tem, particularly with respect to the quality of care de-
livered and the growing costs associated with care. In this
study, we apply the quality framework of underuse, over-
use, and misuse to a nationally representative sample of
patients cared for in ambulatory care settings to deter-
mine whether the overuse and misuse of health care ser-
vices have decreased in the past decade.
METHODS
DATA SOURCE
We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from the
1998, 1999, 2008, and 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NAMCS) and the outpatient department component
of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NHAMCS). The NAMCS and NHAMCS are nationally repre-
sentative surveys conducted annually by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health
Statistics. The NAMCS surveys patient visits to physicians in
non­federally funded, non­hospital-based offices; the NHAMCS
surveys patient visits to physicians in non­federally funded hos-
pital outpatient departments. The visits sampled take place dur-
ing a 1-week period that is randomly assigned for each prac-
tice (a 4-week sample period is used in NHAMCS). We pooled
1998 and 1999 data and 2008 and 2009 data to increase the
sample sizes.
Both surveys use a multistage stratified probability sam-
pling design that allows for the generation of national esti-
mates on the patient-visit level. Information collected in both
surveys includes the visit characteristics, diagnoses, medica-
tions, and services ordered.
QUALITY MEASURES
We developed our quality indicators using a combination of
current performance measures and guideline recommenda-
tions (Table 1). Each indicator was chosen because it per-
tained to outpatient quality of care and could be reliably cal-
culated using information in the NAMCS and NHAMCS in the
study years. We identified 22 measures, which we organized
into 1 of 3 categories: underuse, overuse, or misuse (Table 1)
of health care services.9-31 Although in some cases we applied
guideline recommendations that were published after 1999 or
after 2009, this approach allowed for comparative assess-
ments of the quality of care over time and is consistent with
previous examinations of quality using NAMCS and NHAMCS.8
For each indicator, we identified the eligible population (de-
nominator) using a combination of variables: patient's reason
for the visit, the diagnosis (classified using the International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification di-
agnostic codes), and the diagnosis check-boxes (owing to
changes in survey design, this variable was not used to iden-
tify eligible visits in the 1998 and 1999 NAMCS or NHAMCS).
We excluded patient visits on the basis of clinical contraindi-
cations. For example, we were interested in examining the ex-
tent to which patients with atrial fibrillation are prescribed an-
ticoagulation, on the basis of a quality measure developed by
the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Associa-
tion, and American Medical Association Physician Consor-
tium for Performance Improvement.9 We constructed the de-
nominator for this quality indicator by identifying all visits by
patients with documented atrial fibrillation who did not have
a contraindication to anticoagulation, such as a diagnosis of gas-
trointestinal bleeding. We then measured the proportion of vis-
its in which the patients were prescribed anticoagulation. Medi-
cations were identified using a combination of the medication
codes developed by the National Center for Health Statistics
and the Multum Lexicon Plus database.32
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For each measure, we calculated the weighted proportion of
eligible visits in which the patient received recommended care
or, in the case of our overuse and misuse measures, the weighted
proportion of eligible visits in which the patient received non-
recommended care. We then used the 2 test to compare dif-
ferences in these weighted proportions between 1998-1999 and
2008-2009.
We took into account the sampling weights and sample de-
sign variables available in NAMCS and NHAMCS to generate
these weighted, nationally representative estimates. The reli-
ability of the estimates is in accordance with the standards speci-
fied by the National Center for Health Statistics, and quality
indicators were not included if they had less than 30 un-
weighted cases in each cell.33 We generated 95% CIs using Stata
statistical software, version 11.0 (StataCorp).
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
In our study sample, there were 79 083 and 102 980 un-
weighted visits by adult patients at least 18 years of age
in 1998-1999 and 2008-2009, respectively (Table 2).
Compared with visits made in 1998-1999, visits in
2008-2009 were by slightly older patients (mean age,
54.2 years in 2008-2009 vs 50.9 years in 1998-1999;
P  .001) and by more patients insured through Medi-
care (26.2% vs 22.7%; P = .03). Otherwise, the 1998-
1999 and 2008-2009 study samples were similar with
respect to patient sex, race, ethnicity, reason for visit,
and practice region.
CHANGES IN UNDERUSE MEASURES
In our analysis of underuse measures, we observed a
statistically significant improvement in 6 of 9 quality
indicators (Table 3). In the 10-year interval under
consideration, there was an improvement in the use of
antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation (45.9% to
71.9%; P  .01). There was also an improvement in the
use of aspirin (28.4% to 64.5%; P  .01), -blockers
(28.1% to 55.2%; P  .01), and statins (26.8% to
58.6%; P  .01) in coronary artery disease. There were
also improvements in the use of -blockers in conges-
tive heart failure (20.6% to 59.7%; P  .01) and the use
of statins in diabetes mellitus (12.1% to 36.2%;
P  .01). We did not find statistically significant differ-
ences in the remaining underuse quality indicators: the

CHANGES IN OVERUSE OVER TIME
We observed an improvement in only 2 of 11 overuse
quality indicators, 1 indicator became worse, and 8 did
not change. There was a statistically significant de-
crease in the overuse of cervical cancer screening in vis-
its for women older than 65 years (3.1% to 2.2%;
P = .02) and in the overuse of antibiotics for asthma ex-
acerbations (22.3% to 6.8%; P  .01). Rates of urinaly-
sis testing at general medical examinations also de-
creased, although the difference was of borderline
significance (39.9% vs 25.3%; P = .05). However, there
was an increase in the overuse of prostate cancer
screening in men older than 74 years (3.5% to 5.7%;
P = .03). There were no changes in the remaining 7
overuse measures: complete blood count and electro-
cardiogram testing in general medical examinations,
use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections
and acute bronchitis, mammography for women 75
years or older, imaging in acute back pain, and chest
x-ray in general medical examinations.
CHANGES IN MISUSE OVER TIME
Of the 2 misuse indicators, there was 1 significant im-
provement. The proportion of patients with a urinary tract
infection who were prescribed an inappropriate antibi-
otic decreased from 24.9% to 2.7% (P  .01). There was
no change in the proportion of elderly patients who were
prescribed inappropriate medications. Adjusting for in-
surance status to account for potential differences in ac-
cess to care did not change our results.
COMMENT
In our examination of ambulatory health care services
over 10 years, we found an improvement in 6 of 9 mea-
sures of underuse but only 3 of 13 measures of inappro-
priate care (both overuse and misuse). Our findings of
the continued delivery of inappropriate care, such as the
use of prostate-specific antigen testing in older men and
cervical cancer screening in older women, are consis-
tent with other studies34,35 that demonstrate the persis-
tence of inappropriate care. Our results also suggest that
there has been little change in the delivery of inappro-
priate ambulatory care in the past decade.
Given the questionable sustainability of the current
trajectory of health care costs, our findings uniquely in-
form the discussion of strategies to improve the quality
of health care, particularly as solutions are analyzed with
an eye on their affordability and financial impact. We
found considerable room for improvement in most of our
overuse measures, a space in which the dual goals of high
quality and reduced costs can be met, and demon-
strated that attention to underuse and overuse has been
uneven. The United States has a higher total expendi-
ture on health relative to its gross domestic product com-
pared with all other countries.36 Although there is con-
tinuing debate about what constitutes a reasonable cost
of health care, there is growing momentum in deliver-
ing higher quality care that costs less. Reducing inap-
propriate care where patients clearly do not benefit and
for which there may be added risk is certainly part of this
stated goal.37
There are several possible explanations for our find-
ings; however, among the most likely is that targeting and
reducing inappropriate care has not been a real focus of
the quality of care movement. In the past 2 decades, there
has been substantial growth in methods to measure qual-
ity in health care. These quality measures have devel-
oped alongside the growing understanding that medi-
cine can and should be delivered on the basis of evidence.
Using a combination of information from clinical trials
and observational studies, panels of expert physicians have
created clinical practice guidelines, a repository of which
is maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality.38 The creation of clinical practice guidelines has
informed the development of metrics to assess the qual-
ity of our health care system.39 Although quality assess-
ments are dominated by process-based measures, these
have mostly taken the form of underuse measures. And
despite the acknowledgment that overuse contributes to
waste and inefficiency in our health care system, it is not

routinely measured in quality assessments. In light of the
abundance of literature and practice guidelines related
to underuse, our finding that the overuse of ambulatory
care may have changed little during the past 10 years is
not entirely unexpected. Reducing inappropriate care will
require the same attention to guideline development and
performance measurement that was directed at reduc-
ing the underuse of needed therapies.
Developing guidelines and performance measures to
reduce inappropriate care may be easier said than done.
Manymethodologic,political,andculturalchallengeshave
impeded progress in these areas. There are 2 main meth-
odologic challenges to creating quality measures that ad-
dress the delivery of inappropriate care.40 First, overuse,
unlike underuse, is not easily studied within publicly re-
ported databases or within hospital claims data. For ex-
ample, if a patient has an acute myocardial infarction, all
that may be needed to determine whether a patient ap-
propriately received an aspirin is the discharge diagno-
sis, inpatient medication list, and discharge medica-
tions. The second challenge is the difficulty in creating
guidelines and measures around overuse of many types
of health care services. Determining if a patient inappro-
priately received a procedure requires a much more de-
tailed set of clinical criteria than what is required for as-
sessments of underuse. Although there are methods for
assessing the appropriate use of services, such as the
RAND Appropriateness Method, they are typically time-
consuming and expensive processes.41 For example, cre-
ating appropriateness criteria using the RAND Appro-
priateness Method for the appropriate insertion of
tympanostomy tubes requires not only a systematic re-
view of the literature but also assembling an expert panel
composed of physicians from multiple specialties, such
as pediatricians and pediatric otolaryngologists grading
an exhaustive and mutually exclusive list of clinical fac-
tors, such as the presence of hearing or language de-
lay.42 Some specialty organizations (eg, American Col-
lege of Cardiology/American Heart Association43) have
developed appropriateness criteria around a number of
procedures and diagnostic tests. However, the method
has not been widely implemented to develop a robust set
of guidelines across a large spectrum of services.
There has also been no formal effort to develop and
promote the use of standardized overuse measures even
though there are some simple measures of overuse that
could be easily implemented and studied. For example,
there is good evidence that screening for prostate can-
cer in the very elderly and infirm is not beneficial44 and
yet it continues to be performed at alarming rates.35 De-
spite being easily measured, this practice has not been
evaluated as a potential performance measure or ad-
opted by the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Informa-
tion Set.
There are political and cultural challenges to address-
ing overuse as well, namely, resistance to limiting ac-
cess to health care services. For example, the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency
for Health Care Policy and Research), whose charge in-
cludes the creation of practice guidelines, was nearly dis-

solved when it recommended against the use of surgery
in the initial management of low-back pain.45 The gov-
ernment has not since taken up the mantle of address-
ing inappropriate care through the creation of practice
guidelines. The unwillingness of our society to address
overuse to achieve both high quality and affordability re-
flects the pervasive fear of rationing46 and the interests
of industry stakeholders.
The reactions by physicians to limiting inappropri-
ate care have been mixed. For example, when the United
States Preventive Services Task Force recently updated
and published its draft recommendations discouraging
the use of prostate-specific antigen screening in asymp-
tomatic men, it received strong words of rebuke from the
American Urologic Association.47 However, not all phy-
sicians are opposed to limiting care with unclear ben-
efits. Recently, the National Physicians Alliance through
its Good Stewardship project launched a campaign to limit
inappropriate ambulatory care and proposed a set of 5
overused practices in the fields of internal medicine, fam-
ily medicine, and pediatrics.3,5 The American Board of
Internal Medicine Foundation followed suit and launched
the "Choosing Wisely" campaign, in which they coordi-
nated with 9 physician specialty organizations, includ-
ing cardiologists, radiologists, and oncologists, to iden-
tify tests or procedures that are commonly used and not
always appropriate.48 The campaign is notable for the col-
laboration with many procedure-oriented physician
groups who are valuing high-quality care over financial
gains. These initiatives may be foreshadowing a change
in practice culture that may be necessary to begin the hard
work of addressing the delivery of inappropriate care in
the US health care system.
There are limitations to the conclusions of our study.
First, the number of underuse, overuse, and misuse mea-
sures available in the NAMCS and NHAMCS data sets is
limited; thus, our study presents just part of the picture
of appropriateness of care in ambulatory care settings,
and we cannot conclude with statistical confidence that
misuse occurred with greater frequency than underuse.
Second, some of the observed differences may not be sta-
tistically significant because of insufficient statistical
power. Third, we were limited by the availability of data
in the NAMCS database. For example, the NAMCS docu-
ments only 6 to 8 medications per visit and it is possible
that appropriate or inappropriate medications were not
documented for some visits, leading to overestimation
or underestimation. Fourth, we may have underesti-
mated the receipt of some services because NAMCS docu-
ments the services provided at only 1 visit per year. How-
ever, the trends remain informative because biases arising
from a once-a-year assessment apply equally to all years
of study. Last, we were unable to examine explanatory
mechanisms for underuse or overuse, such as physician
rationale and decision making. Understanding the root
cause of overuse will require looking beyond most pub-
lic use data sets or claims-based data.
In our examination of ambulatory care in the United
States, we found an improvement in most of the under-
use measures but limited changes in the delivery of inap-
propriate care. Reducing health care costs and improving
the quality of care in the United States can be achieved by
reducing overuse and misuse of health care services, but
it will require making uncomfortable decisions that pa-
tients, physicians, and policymakers have been histori-
callyunwillingtomake.Developingclinicalpracticeguide-
lines that define when care should not be delivered and
performance measures to address inappropriate care are
critical steps to advance the mission of increasing the value
and efficiency of health care delivery.
