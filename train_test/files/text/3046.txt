Context.--Significant symptoms of depression are common in the older
community-dwelling population. Although depressive symptoms and disability may
commonly occur in the same person, whether depressive symptoms contribute to
subsequent functional decline has not been elucidated.
Objective.--To determine whether depressive symptoms in older persons
increase the risk of subsequent decline in physical function as measured by objec-
tive performance-based tests.
Design.--A 4-year prospective cohort study.
Setting.--The communities of Iowa and Washington counties, Iowa.
Participants.--A total of 1286 persons aged 71 years and older who completed
a short battery of physical performance tests in 1988 and again 4 years later.
Main Outcome Measures.--Baseline depressive symptoms were assessed by
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Physical performance
tests included an assessment of standing balance, a timed 2.4-m (8-ft) walk, and
a timed test of 5 repetitions of rising from a chair and sitting down.
Results.--After adjustment for baseline performance score, health status, and
sociodemographic factors, increasing levels of depressive symptoms were predic-
tive of greater decline in physical performance over 4 years (odds ratio for decline
in those with depressed mood vs those without, 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.02-2.34). Even among those at the high end of the functional spectrum, who re-
ported no disability, the severity of depressive symptoms predicted subsequent
decline in physical performance (odds ratio for decline, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08).
Conclusions.--This study provides evidence that older persons who report de-
pressive symptoms are at higher risk of subsequent physical decline. These results
suggest that prevention or reduction of depressed mood could play a role in reduc-
ing functional decline in older persons.

MAJOR DEPRESSION is relatively
rare among older community-dwelling
persons,affectingonlyabout1%to2%of
that population.1-3 However, a high pro-
portion of community-dwelling elderly
persons (12%-20%)1-3 suffer from signifi-
cant symptoms of depression below the
severity threshold of major depression
as defined by the Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). These sub-
syndromal depressive symptoms, often
referred to as "depressed mood," are as-
sociated with high societal costs due to
increased morbidity and high utilization
of health services.1-5 From the perspec-
tive of older persons themselves, de-
pressed mood significantly affects their
well-being and ability to function.67
Physical disability among depressed
persons not only is significantly higher
than among nondepressed persons, but
also is similar or even greater than the
disability found among patients with
chronic medical illnesses.8
The relationship between depression
andphysicalfunctioningisacomplexone
whose specific causal ordering is hard to
unravel. Researchers so far have mainly
focusedonself-reportedmeasuresofdis-
abilityandfoundthatthecross-sectional
association between depressed mood
and disability seems to hold longitudi-
nally.1,6,7 Even in longitudinal studies,
however,itisdifficulttoexcludethepos-
sibility that disability is a cause rather
than a consequence of depressive symp-
toms. Further, the interpretation is
hampered by the possibility that de-
pressed persons may give overly pessi-
misticappraisalsoftheirfunctioningand
disability.9 Even when their functional
status remains the same, persons who
are depressed tend to become more de-
pressed over time and, therefore, may
report more physical disabilities.10,11 Fi-
nally, disability measures assess the
poorer end of the spectrum of physical
functioning but have less ability to dis-
tinguish higher levels of physical abili-
ties. Consequently, whether depression
affects physical function along its full
spectrum remains to be examined.

The growing interest in the heteroge-
neity of functional ability at older ages
has resulted in the need to expand the
measurement of physical function be-
yond the standard self-report measures
of disability. Increasingly, functional
statushasbeenassessedusingobjective
tests of subjects' performance of stan-
dardized tasks and covers the full spec-
trumofphysicalfunctioning.Thesemea-
sures of physical performance provide
useful information about older persons
not obtained in standard clinical exami-
nation12 andarehighly predictive of sub-
sequentdisability,falls,institutionaliza-
tion, and death.13-16 In addition, perfor-
mance-basedmeasuresappeartobeless
influencedbypersonality,cognition,and
moodthanself-reportedmeasuresofdis-
ability.10,11 These characteristics make
performance-based measures of physi-
cal function very appropriate for a more
complete and compelling test of the im-
pact of depressive symptoms on physi-
cal decline along the entire spectrum of
physical function.
The present study is the first to pro-
spectively examine the impact of depres-
sivesymptomsonchangeinphysicalper-
formance in an older community-dwell-
ing population. Since it is unknown
whether the effect of depressive symp-
toms is limited to high symptom levels or
whether it increases linearly with in-
creasing symptom levels, a continuous
measure of depressive symptoms as well
as a dichotomous classification of de-
pressed mood are used. In order to rule
out confounding by poor physical func-
tion,additionalanalysesareconductedin
a relatively healthy subset of older per-
sons initially free of physical disabilities.
METHODS
Study Population
Data for this study were collected as
part of the Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(EPESE), a prospective cohort study of
older persons supported by the US Na-
tional Institute on Aging. The eligible
population consisted of all persons aged
65 years and older who lived in Iowa and
Washington counties, Iowa. The sam-
pling and data collection procedures
have been described in depth previ-
ously.17 Between December 1981 and
August 1982, 3673 persons, 80% of those
eligible, were enrolled in the initial in-
terview.Follow-upinterviewswerecon-
ducted annually for 6 years and again at
10 years.
The sixth follow-up assessment con-
ducted in 1988 is considered the baseline
for the analyses presented, as this was
thefirstassessmentthatincludedphysi-
cal performance measures. At that time,
2547 (94.0%) of the 2711 survivors were
contacted. Of these, we excluded 278
(10.9%) who were institutionalized; 111
(4.4%) who were unable to participate in
the interview because of cognitive or
physical impairment and for whom a
proxy had to be interviewed; 57 (2.2%)
who had to be interviewed by telephone
because they left the geographic area;
and 68 (2.7%) with missing scores for
physicalperformance(n = 59)ordepres-
sive symptoms (n = 9).
Of the 2033 remaining subjects with
complete baseline data, 411 (20.2%) died
during the next 4 years; 74 (3.6%) were
lost to follow-up; 256 (12.6%) were un-
able to participate in the complete inter-
viewbecauseofcognitiveorphysicalim-
pairmentandwereincludedintelephone
(n = 86) or proxy interviews (n = 170);
and 6 (0.3%) had missing performance
scores. This left 1286 subjects for whom
follow-up data on physical performance
were available. These served as the pri-
mary subjects of this report. As com-
pared with these subjects, those who
were interviewed in 1988 but who were
not included in this study were signifi-
cantly older (80.1 vs 77.7 years), more
often men (39.9% vs 31.0%), more often
activities of daily living (ADL)­disabled
(49.2% vs 30.8%), and had higher mean
depression scores (11.8 vs 9.2).
Symptoms of Depression
Thepresenceofdepressivesymptoms
was assessed using the 11-item version
of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale (CES-D), a measure-
ment of depressive feelings and behav-
iors experienced during the past week.18
Scores of this shorter version were
transformed to correspond to the stan-
dard 20-item scale using the procedure
recommended by Kohout et al.19 Full de-
tails on the use, transformation, and va-
lidity of the modified scale have been
published.19 Briefly, for men and women
separately, scores were standardized
against the 1974-1975 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey I
(NHANES I), by means of the equation
xt
= [(xs
- ms
) (sdt
/sds
)] + mt
, where xt
is
the transformed score; xs
is the partici-
pant's raw score; ms
and sds
are the sex-
specificmeanandSDoftherawscoresin
thefullsampleatthefirstinterview;and
mt
and sdt
are the sex-specific criterion
mean and SD from the NHANES I.
Since the NHANES I study used a large
national probability sample, it gave gen-
eralizable, national criterion means for
theCES-D.Thecriterionmean(SD)was
7.1(7.2)formenand10.0(9.1)forwomen.
We used both the continuous CES-D
score and a dichotomous classification
based on the cutoff score of 20 to identify
subjectswithdepressedmood.Although
a CES-D score of 16 is the most com-
monly used cutoff score in general popu-
lations, using a cutoff score of 20 among
olderpersonsoffersamorestringentap-
proach to the classification of depressed
mood, yielding a higher accuracy for the
diagnosis of major depression.20-22 Sen-
sitivities of 72% and 92% and specifici-
tiesof94%and87%formajordepression
defined according to DSM-IV criteria
have been reported.21,22
Physical Performance
Performance-based tests of physical
function included measures of standing
balance, walking speed, and ability to
risefromachair.Assessmentswerecar-
ried out in the subjects' homes by spe-
cially trained interviewers. For testing
standing balance, subjects attempted to
maintain their feet in the side-by-side,
semitandem (heel of one foot beside big
toeofotherfoot)andtandem(heelofone
footinfrontofotherfoot)positionsfor10
seconds each. The classification range is
as follows: unable (0); able to hold side-
by-side position but unable to hold
semitandem stand position for 10 sec-
onds (1); able to hold semitandem posi-
tion for 10 seconds but unable to hold full
tandem position for more than 2 seconds
(2); able to stand in full tandem position
for 3 to 9 seconds (3); and able to main-
tain full tandem position for 10 seconds
(4). To test walking speed, a 2.4-m (8-ft)
walk at the subject's normal pace was
timedtwice,andthefasterofthe2walks
was scored according to quartiles of the
timerequiredin3EPESEpopulations.14
Categories were unable (0); at least 5.7
seconds (1); 4.1 to 5.6 seconds (2); 3.2 to
4.0 seconds (3); and 3.1 seconds or less
(4). For testing the ability to rise from a
chair, subjects were asked to fold their
arms across their chests and to stand up
from a sitting position and sit down 5
times as quickly as possible. Categories,
based on quartiles of the time required
inthe3EPESEpopulations,wereasfol-
lows: unable (0); at least 16.7 seconds (1);
13.7 to 16.6 seconds (2); 11.2 to 13.6 sec-
onds (3); and 11.1 seconds or less (4).
Correlations between observers of
more than 0.93 for walking speed23 and
test-retestcorrelationsofmorethan0.89
for walking speed,23 0.73 for rising from
a chair,24 and 0.97 for standing balance25
have been reported. The 3 test scores in
our study were moderately correlated,
with Spearman rank correlation coeffi-
cients ranging from 0.30 to 0.51. As in
previous publications,14,16 a summary
measure of physical performance was
developed by summing scores of the 3
tests. The overall performance score
ranged from 0 to 12, with higher scores
indicating better performance. Change
in physical performance was computed

bysubtractingthebaselineperformance
score (1988) from the follow-up score
(1992). Change scores among the 1286
respondents ranged from -12 to 8, with
a mean change of -1.6 (Figure 1). The
physical performance of 863 subjects
(67.1% of the total sample) had declined,
and 31.1% of those (400 of the total
sample) were reported as declining
by 3 or more points. However, 215 per-
sons (16.7%) improved their perfor-
mance scores. For the remainder of the
sample (n = 208, 16.2%), 1992 perfor-
mance scores were equal to their 1988
scores.
Covariates
Baseline sociodemographics included
age, sex, marital status, and education.
Indicators of baseline health status in-
cluded smoking status (never, ex-, or
current smoker), alcohol intake (an av-
erage consumption of 1 or less vs more
than 1 drink per day), body mass index
(computed as weight in kilograms
divided by the square of height in me-
ters),andbloodpressure.Thelatterwas
measured in a sitting position according
to the Hypertension Detection and Fol-
low-up Program protocol26 and was clas-
sifiedin4categories:normotension(sys-
tolicbloodpressure[SBP],140mmHg;
diastolic blood pressure [DBP], 90
mm Hg); borderline systolic hyperten-
sion (DBP, 90 mm Hg; SBP, 140-160
mm Hg); isolated systolic hypertension
(DBP, 90 mm Hg; SBP, 160 mm Hg);
and diastolic hypertension (DBP, 90
mm Hg). Prevalent coronary heart dis-
ease at baseline was determined by any
listed hospital discharge diagnosis In-
ternational Classification of Diseases,

in the Health Care Financing Adminis-
tration Medicare Provider Analysis and
Review files, by self-report of heart at-
tack at any interview, or by a positive
Rosequestionnaire28 foranginaassessed
at any in-person interview. Prevalent
diabetes, stroke, cancer, and lung dis-
ease (asthma, chronic bronchitis, or em-
physema) were considered present
when respondents had ever been told by
a physician that they had these diseases
or when they had listed hospital dis-
charge diagnoses in the past 3 years for
these diseases (ICD-9 codes 250, 430-
434, 140-208, or 491-493, respectively).
Prevalent arthritis was determined by
self-reportedpresenceofarthritisatany
in-person interview. Information about
drug use was obtained by interviewers'
observation of the containers for all pre-
scription and nonprescription drugs
taken over the past 2 weeks. Finally,
physical disability was assessed by self-
reports of difficulty in mobility (unable
towalkahalfmileorclimbstairswithout
help), according to the Rosow-Breslau
scale,29 and/orself-reportsofdifficultyin
ADL30 (unable to bathe, dress, eat, use
the toilet, walk across a small room, or
transfer from bed to chair without help).
Statistical Analyses
Since change scores of physical per-
formance were continuous and approxi-
mately normally distributed (Figure 1),
multivariate linear regression models
were used to examine the effect of de-
pressive symptoms on change in physi-
cal performance. These models included
baseline physical performance scores in
order to model residualized change (ie,
change adjusted for baseline level of
performance)31 and were adjusted for
age, sex, cigarette smoking, alcohol in-
take, body mass index, blood pressure,
and prevalent chronic diseases. Sepa-
ratemodelsexaminedtheeffectsofboth
the continuous and dichotomous depres-
sion variables in order to evaluate "gra-
dient" vs "threshold" effects.
Logistic regression models were per-
formed to identify the association of de-
pressive symptoms with more substan-
tial, and potentially more significant,

whose performance scores decreased by
3 or more points during follow-up (ie, a
decline of at least 2 points more than the
medianchangeof-1)wereconsideredas
having declined substantially. Those
whose performance scores increased by
1 or more points (ie, improved 2 points
morethanthemedianchange)werecon-
sidered as having improved. Persons
with no substantial change were those
with change scores within 2 points of the
median change (change scores between
-3 and 1). Two sets of odds ratio (OR)
estimates indicate the relative odds of
being among those who had declined vs
those in the no-change group, and the
relative odds of being among those who
had improved vs the no-change group.
All analyses were carried out using the
SPSS-Windows statistical package.32
PreviousEPESEanalysesillustrated
that lower levels of physical perfor-
mance predict nursing home admission,
mortality and subsequent disability.14,16
To validate that our definition of sub-
stantial decline is associated with clini-
cally meaningful differences in health
status,weusedthe1988EPESEdataon
more than 5000 persons aged 71 years
and older to examine the risks of a 3-
pointdifferenceinphysicalperformance
score. After 4 years of follow-up, a 3-
point difference was associated with a
1.5-fold increased risk of hospitalization
(95%CI,1.4-1.6),a2.2-foldincreasedrisk
of nursing home admission (95% CI, 2.0-
2.5),a1.7-foldincreasedriskofmortality
(95% CI, 1.6-1.8), and, among those not
disabled at baseline, a 3.9-fold increased
risk of subsequent disability (95% CI,
3.3-4.5).
RESULTS
The mean baseline age of the study
samplewas77.7years(SD,4.9),69%were
female,45%hadlessthan12yearsofedu-
cation,andonly1personwasblack.Base-
line CES-D scores ranged from 0 to 53
with a mean of 9.2 (SD, 7.8). In total, 137
persons(10.7%)hadCES-Dscoresabove
the cutoff of 20 and were considered as
havingadepressedmood.Depressedper-
sons had lower baseline performance
scoresthannondepressedpersons(6.9vs

only 1 exception, for each level of base-
line performance, the mean perfor-
mancescoreatfollow-upafter4yearswas
lower in depressed persons compared
with nondepressed persons.
The decline in performance, adjusted
for baseline performance, was signifi-
cantly greater for the oldest old, the less
educated, unmarried subjects, and those
withcoronaryheartdiseaseandlungdis-
ease (Table 1). Depressed persons had a
greater decline in performance than non-
depressedpersons(2.36vs1.48,P.001).

baseline were significantly associated
with greater decline in performance dur-
ing follow-up (for each point of increase
on the CES-D, decline was 0.036 greater,

mood as assessed by the dichotomous in-
dicator was also predictive of greater
decline in performance ( = -0.774;

residuals did not reveal departures from
regression assumptions. The effect of de-

3 components of the summary perfor-
mance score: the CES-D score predicted
change in standing balance ( = -0.020,
P.001), change in walking speed
( = -0.014, P.001), and change in abil-
ity to rise from a chair ( = -0.0051,
P = .02). Use of antidepressant drugs
(mostly amitriptyline) was significantly
higher(P = .003)amongpersonswithde-
pressed mood (10.2%) than among non-
depressed persons (4.4%). However, an-
tidepressant use was not associated with
change in physical performance, and ad-
ditional adjustment for this variable did
not change the results of the regression
models.
For a graphical presentation of the
gradient effect of depressive symptoms,
the CES-D score was divided into 5 lev-
els whereby the highest level corre-
sponded with the depressed mood cat-
egory (20) and the remainder of the
scores were divided into 4 roughly equal
subgroups: 0 to 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 12, and 13 to
19. Adjusted mean changes in perfor-
mance by level of depressive symptoms
are illustrated in Figure 3. This graph
illustrates that increasing levels of
depressive symptoms are associated
with greater physical decline (P for
trend = .001). When compared with the
referencegroupofpersonswiththelow-
est level of depressive symptoms (mean,
-1.27), a greater performance decline
was not only observed for persons with
CES-D scores of 20 or more (mean,
-2.26, P.001), but also for those with
scores of 13 to 19 (mean, -1.75, P.05)
and scores of 7 to 12 (mean, -1.59,
P.10). An additional regression model
that used both the continuous CES-D
score and the CES-D squared term
showed no significant improvement in
the predictionofchangeinperformance,
demonstrating that the relationship be-
tweendepressivesymptomsanddecline
in performance is not curvilinear.
To obtain a picture of the effect of de-
pressive symptoms free of the possible
confounding effect of poor physical func-
tioning, analyses were repeated among
the 976 persons who had no ADL or mo-
bilitydisabilityatbaselinein1988(Table
2). Again, the continuous CES-D score
and the indicator of depressed mood
were significant predictors of declined
physical performance ( = -0.031,
P = .002 and  = -0.646, P.001, respec-
tively). Even after a further restriction
tothosewithoutdisabilityatbaselineand
at follow-up in 1992, a similar, although
slightly weaker, picture emerged. A
higherCES-Dscorewassignificantlyas-
sociated with change in performance
( = -0.022,P = .03),anddepressedmood
was marginally associated ( = -0.432,
P = .13). The absence of interaction be-
tween depressive symptoms and disabil-
ity was confirmed by the nonsignificant
interaction (P = .72). To rule out other
possible interactions, additional analy-
ses were stratified by sex, education,
marital status, smoking behavior, and
presence of chronic disease, but the ef-
fect of depressive symptoms was found
to be consistent across subgroups (data
not shown).
The effect of depressive symptoms on
more substantial change in physical per-
formance was studied in 2 sets of multi-
variatelogisticregressionanalyses.Inad-
ditiontodepressivesymptoms,covariates
predictive of substantial change in per-
formance were included in the final mod-
els. For substantial decline (ie, decline of
at least 3 points), the covariates were as
follows: baseline performance (OR, 1.21;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.28);
age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.10); preva-
lentcoronaryheartdisease(OR,1.73;95%
CI, 1.09-2.07); and prevalent lung dis-
ease (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.09-2.07). Table
3 shows that after adjustment for these
covariates a higher CES-D score signifi-
cantly increased the risk of being among
those who had substantially declined vs
those in the no-change group (OR, 1.03;
95%CI,1.01-1.04).Likewise,thedichoto-

COMMENT
Our study provides evidence that de-
pressivesymptomsinolderpersonspre-
dict subsequent decline in physical per-
formanceaftera4-yearperiod.Although
decreased levels of performance were
most pronounced in older persons with
significant depressed mood, among the
less severely depressed persons, the
level of symptoms of depression also
showedagradientofriskforsubsequent
physical decline. The results were simi-
lar when the analyses were restricted to
subjects without physical disability.
Thus, in older persons at the high end of
the functional spectrum, depressive
symptoms were also predictive of sub-
sequentdeclineinphysicalperformance.
Our results are compatible with find-
ings by others that depressive symp-
toms were associated with subsequent
self-reportedphysicaldisability.1,6,7 How-
ever, by using a battery of physical
performance tests that covers the entire
spectrumofphysicalfunctioning,wedem-
onstrate that the effect of depressive
symptoms is not limited to physical dis-
ability,butthatdepressivesymptomsalso
predict physical decline outside the dis-
abled range. Since performance-based
measures have been shown to be less bi-
ased by mood, cognition, and personality
aspectsthanbyself-reportsofphysicaldis-
ability,10,11 our findings provide addi-
tional,morecompellingevidenceforalink
between depressive symptoms and sub-
sequent physical decline. Our results
complement another set of population-
based research data indicating that poor
physicalfunctionisariskfactorfortheon-
set of depressive symptoms.33,34 These 2
bodies of research suggest that depres-
sion and poor physical function are mu-
tually reinforcing, causing a progressive
downward spiral in the physical and psy-
chological health of older persons.
Researchers have hypothesized both
biologically mediated pathways and psy-
chological mechanisms for a link be-
tween depressive symptoms and physi-
cal function. Animal and human studies
found that psychological distress causes
neural, hormonal, and immunological al-
terations. By increasing the sympa-
thetic tone, decreasing vagal tone, and
causing immunosuppression, depressed
mood may enhance susceptibility to dis-
ease and result in decreased physical
health in general.35-37 Also, persistent so-
matic symptoms of depression, such as
fatigue or sleeplessness, may worsen the
health status over time. Via psychologi-
calmechanisms,depressedmoodmayim-
pede recovery processes by discourag-
ing persons from obtaining adequate
medical attention and rehabilitation; fol-
lowing treatment regimens; or engag-
ing in healthy lifestyles, such as exercis-
ing, not smoking, and maintaining
healthful eating habits. Data collected in
the first EPESE interview in 1982 pro-
vided some evidence for physical activ-
ity as one of the mechanisms in the link
between depression and physical de-
cline: depressive symptoms were signifi-
cantly associated with less engagement
in walking, gardening, and vigorous ex-
ercise activities during the last month.
Future studies should further examine
to what extent reduced engagement in
physical activities explains the greater
physical decline in older depressed per-
sons.Furthermore,depressionmaylimit
cognitive capacities and may cause a ten-
dencytoamplifyphysicalsymptomssuch
as fatigue and pain.38 This psychological
conductmayunderminetheeffortneeded
to maintain physical function over time.
Some alternative explanations should
be given as well. Depressive symptoms
may represent an adjustment reaction to
subclinical symptoms or disease that, in
themselves, would place subjects at
greater risk for subsequent physical de-
cline. In addition, performance measures
reflect not only what a person is physi-
callycapableofdoingbutalsowhataper-
son is willing or motivated to do. How-
ever,sinceweusedlongitudinaldatawith
adjustment for level of performance at
the time that depression was measured,
it is not likely that our findings are ex-
plained by a reduced motivation to per-
form among the depressed subjects. Fi-
nally,thedepressionandphysicaldecline
link may be due to a third factor (such as
organicbraindysfunctions)thatisrelated
to both conditions.
Physical function is an integral com-
ponent of achieving and maintaining
independence in ADL and a major con-
tributor to the overall health status of
elders. Lower levels of physical perfor-
mance strongly predict institutionaliza-
tion, death, and subsequent disability.
In line with others,24,39 our findings sug-
gest that physical decline reflects mul-
tiplefactors,includingolderage,disease
status, and psychosocial factors. In
contrast to most other significant pre-
dictors, depression is a potentially modi-
fiable and preventable condition. There-
fore, prevention and treatment of
depressive symptoms may be one of the
most effective targets for interventions
aimed at reducing physical decline and
increasing the number of years during
which older people are free of disability.
Although such interventions might be
more feasible and cost-effective if lim-
ited to the most depressed persons, our
findings suggest that there may not be a
need to limit these efforts strictly to
those who meet certain criteria for de-
pressive disorders. The risk association
between depressive symptoms and
physical decline seems to represent a
continuum along the entire spectrum of
physical function. Even outside the dis-
abled range, a higher level of depressive
symptoms increases the risk for subse-
quent decline in physical performance.
As opposed to major depression de-
fined by DSM-IV criteria, depressed
mood is very common in the older gen-
eralpopulation,affectingmorethan10%
in our cohort. Unfortunately, depressed
mood in older persons is often unrecog-
nized,40,41 and the treatment approach
when diagnosed is unclear. Although
more appropriate care for depressed
mood,consistingofincreasedcounseling
and use of appropriate antidepressant
medications, has been shown to be cost-
effective in terms of commensurate im-
provements in older persons' health and
well-being per dollar spent,42 few formal
clinical trials have been conducted. Our
datasuggestthatsuchtrialsmaybeuse-
ful to see whether treatment of de-
pressed mood may prevent the process
whereby depressive symptoms and
physical dysfunctions interact to cause a
progressive downward spiral in the
health status of older persons.
