Abstract
Background: Severe illness due to 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) infection has been reported among persons who are obese or
morbidly obese. We assessed whether obesity is a risk factor for hospitalization and death due to 2009 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1), independent of chronic medical conditions considered by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) to increase the risk of influenza-related complications.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a case-cohort design to compare cases of hospitalizations and deaths from 2009
pandemic A(H1N1) influenza occurring between April­July, 2009, with a cohort of the U.S. population estimated from the
2003­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); pregnant women and children ,2 years old were
excluded. For hospitalizations, we defined categories of relative weight by body mass index (BMI, kg/m2); for deaths, obesity
or morbid obesity was recorded on medical charts, and death certificates. Odds ratio (OR) of being in each BMI category was
determined; normal weight was the reference category. Overall, 361 hospitalizations and 233 deaths included information
to determine BMI category and presence of ACIP-recognized medical conditions. Among $20 year olds, hospitalization was
associated with being morbidly obese (BMI$40) for individuals with ACIP-recognized chronic conditions (OR = 4.9, 95% CI
2.4­9.9) and without ACIP-recognized chronic conditions (OR = 4.7, 95%CI 1.3­17.2). Among 2­19 year olds, hospitalization
was associated with being underweight (BMI#5th percentile) among those with (OR = 12.5, 95%CI 3.4­45.5) and without
(OR = 5.5, 95%CI 1.3­22.5) ACIP-recognized chronic conditions. Death was not associated with BMI category among
individuals 2­19 years old. Among individuals aged $20 years without ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions death
was associated with obesity (OR = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.5­6.6) and morbid obesity (OR = 7.6, 95%CI 2.1­27.9).
Conclusions/Significance: Our findings support observations that morbid obesity may be associated with hospitalization
and possibly death due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection. These complications could be prevented by early antiviral
therapy and vaccination.

Introduction
Since April 2009, the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus,
a novel influenza virus with a combination of gene segments not
previously reported in swine or human influenza viruses, has
spread worldwide and caused epidemics of disease. [1,2] Early
reports suggest that persons with chronic medical conditions
previously recognized as increasing the risk for complications due
to seasonal influenza also have a higher risk of complications due
to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection. [3,4] Conse-
quently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) included individuals with these recognized chronic medical
conditions in their priority groups for receipt of the new 2009
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine. [5]
Preliminary data from the United States and abroad suggest
that obesity (body mass index, BMI$30 kg/m2) and morbid
obesity (BMI$40 kg/m2) is disproportionately represented among
hospitalizations, intensive care admissions, and deaths from 2009
pandemic influenza A(H1N1). [6,7,8,9] We explored the hypoth-
esis that BMI is a risk factor for hospitalization and death due to
pandemic influenza A(H1N1), independent of ACIP-recognized
chronic medical conditions.
Methods
We used three datasets: patients hospitalized with 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1), deaths from 2009 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9694
Survey (NHANES), a representative survey of the general U.S.
population. For each dataset we defined individuals according to
BMI category (see below), presence of ACIP-recognized chronic
medical conditions (defined for this analysis as cardiovascular
disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, cancer, and diabetes) and
age group. We did not include neurologic, neuromuscular,
hematological, non-diabetes metabolic disorders or immunosup-
pression as ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions in this
analysis due to lack of this information from NHANES. We used
two age groups, 2­19 years and $20 years: dividing the $20 year
old age group into additional age categories resulted in unreliable
variance estimates when we stratified by BMI category and presence
of ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions due to zero
observations in primary sampling units of the NHANES survey.
For hospitalized patients and NHANES participants we used
BMI [height (m)/weight (kg)2] as an index of relative weight. For
individuals aged 2­19 years, we calculated age- and sex-specific
BMI z-scores and used CDC 2000 growth charts to define BMI
category, where underweight was ,5th percentile, normal weight
5­84th percentile, overweight 85­94th percentile, and obese was
$95th percentile. [10,11,12] For individuals $20 years we defined
underweight as BMI,18.5, normal weight as 18.5­24.9, over-
weight as 25.0­29.9, obese as 30.0­39.9, and morbidly obese
$40.0. [13,14] For deaths, no data were available on measured
height and weight, so we used mention of obesity or morbid
obesity within the medical condition section of the reporting form.
For all three datasets we excluded individuals ,2 years old and
pregnant women because obesity definitions are not applicable to
them.
We included information on 516 (10%) of 5009 patients
hospitalized with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in the United
States between May 1­July 12, 2009. These patients were a
convenience sample of all hospitalizations reported to CDC from
24 states as part of prospective surveillance project, as described
previously, [15] for which state health departments abstracted
information from medical charts using a standard case form. We
were provided with additional reports of hospitalizations from
New York City, Wisconsin, and Texas, that were not included in
the surveillance project, but had been collected by health
departments using the same or similar abstraction forms during
the same time period. If height and weight were not reported in
data collected for the prospective study, we attempted to contact
patients for this information. For a minority of patients for whom
we had weight but not height data, we estimated their obesity
category by assuming that their height was not less than the 5th
percentile or greater than the 95th percentile of the population (see
Supplement S1). We included information on deaths reported to
CDC from April 27 to July 23, 2009. State health departments
collected information from medical charts, medical examiner
reports, and death certificates, using a standard data collection
form. All hospitalizations and deaths included in our analyses were
confirmed to have pandemic H1N1 infection by real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). [16] We
estimated the proportion of the U.S. population in different BMI
categories from NHANES 2003­4 and 2005­6. NHANES
methodology has been described previously. [17]
For each dataset, we calculated the proportion of individuals in
each BMI category by age group (2­19 years and $20 years). We
stratified our analysis by presence or absence of an ACIP-
recognized chronic medical condition, which is likely to confound
the relationship between BMI category and hospitalization or
death due to 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza. We calculated
the ratio of odds (odds ratio, OR) of being in each BMI category,
where the normal weight category was the reference category, for
hospitalizations and deaths (cases) compared to the U.S.
population (cohort). Because we compared cases to the cohort of
the U.S. population selected before the time period during which
cases could occur (i.e., a case-cohort design), the OR estimates the
risk ratio of hospitalization or death by BMI category. [18] To
estimate 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and p-values of the
odds ratios we used the Taylor series linearization method to
combine the variance estimate of the log-odds of exposure among
cases (hospitalizations or deaths) with a variance of the log-odds of
exposure among the population as estimated using NHANES.
[19,20] For hospitalized patients, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis to consider how robust our analysis was with regard to
adjustment of age among $20 year olds, by creating a logistic
regression model for each BMI category with Normal weight as
the reference category, where hospitalization was the dependent
variable and age group (20.0­35.4, 35.5­45.9, 46.0­54.9, $55.0
years) was the independent variable (see Supplement S1). We
conducted a further sensitivity analysis of our treatment of missing
BMI data (see Supplement S1). We also repeated the analysis for
hospitalized patients after changing the comparison group to a
cohort of the U.S. population that had been admitted to hospital
for any reason in a 12 month period, as estimated by NHANES.
The rationale for this additional analysis was to assess whether any
observed association between BMI category and hospitalization
was due to more frequent hospitalization among obese and
morbidly obese individuals. We used SAS 9.2 for all analyses.
The investigation of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
infections was deemed public health surveillance, not human
subjects research and therefore did not require Institutional
Review Board review.
Results
Between April and July 2009, we identified 565 hospitalized
patients with confirmed 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection; we
excluded 51 patients who were pregnant and 77 who were ,2
years old. Of the remaining 437 patients, 283 (65%) had both
measured height and weight which we used to calculate BMI. In
addition, we estimated BMI category for 78 (19%) patients who
had data on measured weight but not measured height; 52 (27%,
n = 52/191) were patients aged 2­19 years, of which 19% were
estimated to be underweight and 23% were estimated to be obese;
26 (11%, n = 26/246) were patients $20 years, of which 42% were
estimated to be obese or morbidly obese. Our final hospitalized
cohort included 361 patients assigned to a BMI category.
There were 304 deaths among persons with 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) reported to CDC; 16 pregnant women and
eight children ,2 years old were excluded. Of the remaining 280
deaths, 10 (4%) were missing data about chronic medical
conditions and 37 (13%) about obesity, leaving 233 deaths in
our analysis: 31 were 2­19 years old and 202 were $20 years old.
In the U.S. population aged 2­19 years, the prevalence of ACIP-
recognized chronic medical conditions increased with increasing
BMI category: 16.4% were obese and 20.7% had ACIP-recognized
chronic medical conditions (Table 1). In comparison, among
hospitalized patients 2­19 years old, 25.5% were obese, of whom
53.7% had ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions. Among
deaths in 2­19 year olds, 9.7% were obese, of whom 33.3% had
ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions. In the US population
$20 years old, 28.0% were obese and 5.4% were morbidly obese; the
prevalence of ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions increased
only slightly with increasing BMI category: 40.9% of obese and
51.2% of morbidly obese persons had ACIP-recognized chronic
medical conditions. Among hospitalized patients with 2009 pandemic
Obesity and Severe 2009 H1N1

H1N1 infection $20 years old, 32.5% were obese and 67.7% of these
obese patients had ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions,
while 22.5% were morbidly obese, of whom 77.8% had ACIP-
recognized chronic medical conditions. Among deaths in $20 year
olds, 38.1% were obese and 12.4% were morbidly obese; ACIP-
recognized chronic medical conditions were reported for 63.6% of
deaths among obese and 56.0% of morbidly obese individuals.
Among patients 2­19 years, there was no statistically significant
association between being overweight or obese and hospitalization
among those who did or did not have ACIP-recognized chronic
medical conditions (Table 2). However, being underweight was
associated with hospitalization among patients 2­19 years old with
and without ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions (OR=12.5,
95%CI 3.4 to 45.5, p,0.001; OR=5.5, 95%CI 1.3 to 22.5, p,0.001,
respectively) (Table 2). There was no association between BMI
category and death among persons 2­19 years old (Table 2).
Among hospitalized patients aged $20 years with and without
ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions, morbid obesity was
the only BMI category statistically associated with hospitalization
(OR = 4.9, 95%CI 2.4 to 9.9, p,0.001; OR = 4.7, 95%CI 1.3 to
17.2, p,0.001, respectively). These associations remained after
adjustment for age (Supplement S1 Table S3), when we excluded
patients with measured weight but no measured height (Supple-
ment S1 Table S1) and when we assumed that all persons with
missing height and weight were in the normal weight category
(Supplement S1 Table S2). However, the association between
morbid obesity and hospitalization among individuals who did not
have an ACIP-recognized chronic medical condition was not
statistically significant in the final sensitivity analysis (Supplement
S1 Table S2).
BMI category was not associated with death among adults who
had an ACIP-recognized chronic medical condition. However,
death was associated with obesity and morbid obesity among
adults who did not have an ACIP-recognized chronic medical
condition (OR = 3.1, 95%CI 1.5 to 6.6, p,0.001; OR = 7.6,
95%CI 2.1 to 27.9, p,0.001, respectively) (Table 2).
When we repeated our analysis using the subgroup of the U.S.
population that had been hospitalized in the previous year as the
comparison group, morbid obesity remained associated with
hospitalization among $20 year olds with ACIP-recognized
chronic medical condition (OR = 4.1, 95%CI 2.0 to 8.7,
p,0.001), but not significantly so for patients with no ACIP-
recognized chronic medical condition (OR = 4.2, 95%CI 1.0 to
18.0, p = 0.1) (Table 3).
Discussion
Our analysis of early data from the 2009 pandemic in the
United States suggests that morbid obesity, but not obesity, was
statistically associated with hospitalization from 2009 pandemic
H1N1 influenza among adults both who do and do not have
chronic medical conditions. These findings are consistent with
reports from surveillance data of a high prevalence of morbid
obesity among patients hospitalized with 2009 pandemic H1N1
influenza. [6,7,8,9]. Among 2­19 year olds, hospitalization was
associated with being underweight, irrespective of presence of
ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions evaluated in this
analysis. Additionally, we found that deaths among $20 year olds
without ACIP-recognized chronic medical conditions were more
likely to be obese or morbidly obese individuals.

Obesity and Severe 2009 H1N1
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9694
Previous studies have demonstrated that obesity was associated
with an increased number of all cause hospitalization in adults,
[21] although there is no information about the role of obesity in
severe disease due to seasonal influenza. In our study, the elevated
risk for hospitalization due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection
persisted even when we restricted our analysis to the U.S.
population that reported at least one hospitalization in the
previous year, suggesting that the observed associations were not
because morbidly obese persons routinely experience higher
hospitalization rates. Several studies indicate that morbid obesity
may plausibly be an independent risk factor for complications due
to 2009 pandemic H1N1 disease: morbid obesity is associated with
complications in the intensive care unit, including prolonged stay,
prolonged ventilation, and death [22,23] and women with
BMI$30 have a higher likelihood of developing community
acquired pneumonia. [24] The risk for hospitalization among
persons $20 years of age with morbid obesity was similar
regardless of the presence of ACIP-recognized chronic medical
conditions, suggesting that the effect of morbid obesity is
independent of the presence of ACIP-recognized chronic medical
conditions.
We expected to see similar associations between deaths and
BMI categories that we saw for hospitalizations. That we did not
see the same association, especially for obesity and for persons with
ACIP-recognized risk factors, may reflect (1) misclassification of
BMI categories among deaths which did not have measured BMI
or (2) incomplete reporting of ACIP-recognized chronic medical
conditions. Due to the possible misclassification of both BMI and
underlying conditions among fatalities these results should be
interpreted with caution. Additional studies are necessary to better
define the risk of BMI category and underlying conditions, and
death due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection.
Children aged 2­19 years who were obese had an elevated,
but not statistically significant, risk of hospitalization due to
2009 pandemic H1N1 infection and no increased risk of death.
However, the number of pediatric deaths and hospitalizations
were small and confidence intervals were wide. In addition,
children aged 2­19 years who were underweight had an
elevated significant risk of hospitalization due to 2009 pandemic
H1N1 infection. Among the hospitalized children in the
underweight BMI category, 20% (n = 3/15) had neuromuscu-
lar/neurodevelopment disorders and 13% (n = 2/15) had
immunosuppressive conditions. For this analysis, none of these
conditions were included as an ACIP-recognized risk group due
to lack of similar data from NHANES. Therefore, inclusion of
these children in our analysis may in part be responsible for the
observation of an increased risk of hospitalization among
underweight children. The collection of additional data over
time may give further insight into the risk of BMI category and
hospitalization or death due to 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection
among children.
This analysis of data collected during the first wave of the
2009 pandemic H1N1 epidemic in the United States was
exploratory and findings should be considered preliminary until
results from larger and more comprehensive studies are
available. There are a number of potential limitations of our
analysis. Even though our data about hospitalized patients and
deaths were convenience samples, they were collected before
the first reports were published suggesting that obesity may be
associated with severe pandemic H1N1 disease. [4] We used
data from NHANES from 2003­2006 to estimate obesity in the
U.S. population, which has remained constant over the last few
years and so is likely to reflect the prevalence of obesity in 2009
[25]. Moreover, the high response rates for NHANES (the
proportion of sampled individuals who were interviewed and
had a physical examination was 76% in 2003­4 and 77% in
2005­6) indicate that obesity-dependent selection bias is
unlikely. An advantage of NHANES is that the height and
weight of respondents is measured. Medical conditions were
self-reported and could have been under- or over-reported. It is
hard to determine the extent to which this could have
introduced systematic bias. Moreover, NHANES does not
collect information about immunosuppression and neurologic/
neuromuscular and hematological conditions. [5] To reduce the
possibility of bias in our comparison, we did not include these
conditions in our definition of ACIP-recognized chronic
medical conditions for hospitalized patients or deaths. This is
likely to have resulted in an underestimation of the prevalence
of chronic medical conditions in all of the data sources included
in our analysis. While height and weight were incompletely
recorded for hospitalized patients, our results were robust to
various assumptions about these missing data and we conclude
that the observed associations with morbid obesity were unlikely
to be due to missing data bias. However, we had no height or
weight data for deaths, and our results of the association
between BMI category and death should be interpreted with
caution. Finally, some of the observed effect may be due to
residual confounding by race/ethnicity, which we could not
adjust for due to incomplete data for both hospitalizations and
deaths. The impact of this potential bias cannot be determined
from our data. Differences in obesity prevalence have been
observed only between non-Hispanic black and Mexican-
American women but not between other racial/ethnic groups
or among men. [26]
Our findings suggest that in the United States persons who are
morbidly obese, even if they do not have chronic medical
conditions recognized by ACIP as increasing the risk of
influenza-related complications, may be at increased risk for
hospitalization and potentially also for death due to 2009
pandemic H1N1 infection. However, additional studies with a
larger sample of patients and appropriate comparison groups are
needed to confirm these findings. We found that at least half of
Americans who are morbidly obese reported other ACIP-
recognized medical conditions and it is possible that some persons
who are morbidly obese also have unrecognized chronic medical
conditions. Clinicians should evaluate morbidly obese patients
with possible influenza illness for the presence of chronic medical
conditions and if these conditions are present, or if persons with
morbid obesity show signs of lower respiratory tract infection or
other signs of severe illness, these patients should receive empiric
antiviral treatment as early as possible. [27] In addition, as vaccine
becomes available these persons will likely benefit from vaccina-
tion with the 2009 H1N1 vaccine.
