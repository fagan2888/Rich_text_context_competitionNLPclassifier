Introduction
As the population over the age of 65 increases, promoting "suc-
cessful aging"--a capacity to maintain quality of life, health
and independence in later years (1)--is imperative. Successful
aging is dependent upon the ability to preserve mobility-

related functioning and avoid disability. Both have important
implications for the utilization of healthcare, nursing home
admissions, and mortality (2). The goal of minimizing disabil-
ity and chronic disease provides researchers with an incentive
to identify lifestyle, health, and social factors that may impact
physical functioning ability in older adults (1).
Aging is often associated with anthropometric changes, such
as increased abdominal adiposity and decreased skeletal mus-
cle mass (3). Recent evidence on distributions of BMI indicates
that ~64% of adults age 65 and over are either overweight or
obese (4), and as many as 25% of adults over age 65 and 50%
of adults over age 80 have sarcopenia, "defined as appendicular
skeletal muscle mass two standard deviations below the mean
of a young reference group" (5). These changes in body com-
position may be a factor in the degeneration of physical func-
tioning, and contribute to the disability that is frequently seen
in late life. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that sar-
copenia and obesity may act synergistically to exacerbate the
negative effects of each other both behaviorally and 
biologically
(6). The decreases in physical activity that typically accompany
aging may trigger muscle atrophy as well as 
creating an energy
surplus resulting in excess fat accumulation. Furthermore,
individuals with sarcopenic obesity--low muscle mass cou-
pled with the burden of carrying excess weight--may be at
the greatest disadvantage regarding physical functioning (6).
Baumgartner et al. reported that nondisabled older adults with
sarcopenic obesity were over twice as likely to report subse-
quent instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) disability as
were nonobese sarcopenic individuals (7).
The Impact of Insulin Resistance and
Inflammation on the Association Between
Sarcopenic Obesity and Physical Functioning
Morgan E. Levine1 and Eileen M. Crimmins1
Age associated increases in visceral adiposity and decreases in muscle mass (sarcopenia) have been shown to
contribute to disability in late life. Furthermore, there is evidence that obesity-related physiological states, such as
insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, may exacerbate physical functioning problems. Both conditions have
been shown to prompt hypercatabolism and impair the anabolic effect of muscles, ultimately stimulating protein
breakdown and suppressing muscle synthesis. This cross-sectional study investigates whether insulin resistance and
inflammation partially account for the associations between decreased physical functioning and sarcopenic obesity.
Subjects include 2,287 males and females aged 60 and older without diagnosed diabetes from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999­2004). Body composition measurements indicating waist circumference
and appendicular skeletal muscle mass, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), were used to
construct four body composition categories--healthy, sarcopenic nonobese, nonsarcopenic obese, and sarcopenic
obese. Physical functioning was measured using self-reports of difficulty performing six activities. The homeostasis
model assessment (IR
HOMA
) was used to measure insulin resistance, while inflammatory state was assessed through
measurement of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine the
association between physical functioning and body composition, and to evaluate whether differences in insulin
resistance or inflammation partially explained this relationship. In the analysis, we controlled for possible confounders
such as age, education, sex, height, and race/ethnicity. Findings suggest that physical functioning problems are
increased in those with sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenic nonobesity and nonsarcopenic obesity. Furthermore, these
associations may be influenced by differences in insulin resistance among different body composition phenotypes.

Epidemiology
Insulin resistance often occurs with abdominal obesity and
has been shown to prompt metabolic breakdowns of skeletal
muscle, which may manifest clinically as sarcopenia. When
sarcopenia was defined as muscle mass per unit weight, sar-
copenic obese adults were found to have greater levels of insu-
lin resistance than adults who were either solely sarcopenic or
solely obese, regardless of sex (8). Furthermore, diabetes mel-
litus, a condition associated with hyperglycemia resulting from
improper insulin secretion and/or action necessary to maintain
metabolic homeostasis, has also been shown to impair physi-
cal functioning in older individuals. A case­control study by
Sinclair et al. showed that when compared to controls matched
by age and sex, diabetics had significantly reduced physical
functioning and were more likely to require mobility aids such
as wheelchairs and walking sticks (9).
The association between abdominal obesity and insulin
resistance is influenced by an overproduction of inflammatory
cytokines--protein molecules involved in systemic inflam-
mation and immunological responses--which are released
from adipose tissue cells (10). Like insulin resistance, excess
cytokine production has been shown to impact sarcopenia by
promoting the deterioration of skeletal muscle fiber diameter
and protein content, as well as disrupting muscle force pro-
duction and fatigue resistance (11,12). While proinflamma-
tory cytokines have been found to positively associate with fat
mass, Cesari et al. showed that they may be inversely related
to muscle mass as well (13). Additionally, a study by Schrager
et al. showed that older community-dwelling obese individuals
who possessed low muscle strength also had elevated levels of
both C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (14).
In this study, we examine a nationally representative sample of
US citizens over the age of 60 (15) in order to investigate whether
insulin resistance and systemic inflammation partially account
for the associations between decreased physical functioning and
sarcopenic obesity. Based on previous research, we hypothesize
thatindividualswhoaresarcopenicobesewillhavecompromised
physical functioning and that this association will be explained,
in part, by high levels of CRP and increased insulin resistance.
Methods and Procedures
Study population
The study population was comprised of males and females aged 60 and
older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES 1999­2004)--a nationally representative, cross-sectional
study conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) (15). In NHANES individuals over age 60, African Americans,
Mexican Americans, and low-income white Americans are over sam-
pled to provide appropriate sample sizes for analysis. Sampling weights
provided by NHANES are used in estimating frequencies and means, as
well as during our regression analysis and mean comparisons to make
the results representative of the total noninstitutionalized population.
The 4-year weights from NHANES 1999­2002 and 2-year weight from
NHANES 2003­2004 were used to generate 6-year weights in accord-
ance with the formula suggested by NHANES: WT99-04 = ((2/3) ×
WT99-02) + ((1/3) × WT03-04).
Data were collected from at-home interviews and clinical examina-
tions, which took place at a Mobile Examination Center (MEC). Because
fasting is required for valid measurement of plasma glucose and serum
insulin, the subsample used in analysis included individuals who
attended the morning laboratory exam and who had fasted for 8­12h
prior. Because individuals with diagnosed diabetes were not asked to
fast, they are excluded from the study. The number of eligible partici-
pants over age 60 was N = 2,486. Among these, 2,287 participants had
completed data for the primary outcome variable or blood measures
and were included in our analysis. Anthropometric data measurements
for body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA), weight, and waist circumference were determined during the
clinical examination. Because of the potential for nonresponse bias in
the use of only cases with information from the DXA scans, imputed
data were used in analysis as developed and recommended by NHANES
(15). The NHANES files contain five sets of imputed data for each eligi-
ble participant with missing DXA data. The sample size of 2,287 includes
imputed data for 626 cases. While only one record was used in calculat-
ing sample sizes, all five records were used in analyses to insure more
accurate variance estimates as recommended by NHANES. Further
details of recruitment, procedures and study design are available through
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (15).
Body composition
Body composition measurements included waist circumference,
weight, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass. Body weight was meas-
ured using standardized procedures and equipment and was recorded
to the nearest 0.01kg by electronic scale. Waist circumference was
measured to the nearest 0.1cm starting on the right side of the body
at the iliac crest. Measurements for regional bone, fat and lean-tissue
content were collected by whole body DXA scans. We estimate muscle
mass using measurement of appendicular muscle which is the predom-
inant skeletal muscle type involved in physical activity and mobility and
has been shown to account for over 75% of total body skeletal muscle
(16). Appendicular muscle mass was estimated from the sum of the
DXA measurements for the arms and legs as a ratio of total body mass
(appendicular muscle mass/body mass × 100) (8). This formulation has
been found to more closely relate to metabolic syndrome than when
muscle mass is related to height (ASM/Ht2) (8). We believe this measure
better represents the muscle proportion of body mass, which is a central
component of our underlying hypothesis.
Subjects with an ASM <2 SD below the mean of a young reference
group, which included males and females ages 20­40 from NHANES
1999­2003, were classified as sarcopenic. The cutoffs derived from the
reference group were 25.72% for males and 19.43% for females. Compa-
rable means and standard deviations for younger subjects have been used
as reference group cut-points in previous literature (8,17). Obesity was
defined as waist circumference >102cm for males and 88cm for females
(18). Based on these cutoffs, four categorical groups were created--solely
sarcopenic, solely obese, sarcopenic obese, and normal. Because muscle
mass and waist circumference are also related to height, we included
height (in cm) as a control during analysis.
Physical functioning problems
Physical functioning was determined by self-reports of difficulty per-
forming six Nagi tasks--walking a quarter of a mile; walking up ten
steps;stooping,crouchingorkneeling;standingforlongperiodsoftime;
standing up from an armless chair, and lifting or carrying heavy objects.
These items represent an index of mobility and strength that in a fac-
tor analysis of 11 physical functioning items had factor loadings >0.60.
Within our sample a Cronbach's  of.893 was found for the six physical
functioning items. For each item, respondents were asked whether they
had no, some, or much difficulty or were unable to perform the task
with scores for each item ranging from 0 to 3. Respondents who refused
to answer or said that they did not know were considered missing. The
sum of these six scores was then taken to create an overall measure of
physical functioning, ranging from 0 to 18.
Insulin resistance and inflammation
The homeostasis model assessment (IR
HOMA
) was used to measure insu-
lin resistance and calculated using the formula: fasting serum insulin
obesity | VOLUME 20 NUMBER 10 | october 2012 2103

Epidemiology
(U/ml) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (19). Inflammatory
state was measured by CRP, a nonspecific indicator of general levels of
inflammation. High-sensitivity CRP assays were performed on blood
samples using a Behring Nephelometer for quantitative CRP determi-
nation (15).
Sociodemographic characteristics
Self-reports of age, race/ethnicity, and education were used as control
variables, as they have been found to relate to functioning ability (2).
Age was measured in years and was top-coded at 85 in the NHANES
public use data to avoid identification of study participants. Dummy
variables were created to classify race/ethnicity into three categories:
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, with non-
Hispanic whites used as a reference category. Education was reported
in five categories indicating years of school completed. Subjects were
coded to the midpoint of their respective reported categories (partici-
pants who had less than a 9th grade education were coded as 7 years).
Those who had attended high school, but received no diploma were
coded as 10.5 years. Those participants who received high school diplo-
mas, General Education Diplomas or equivalent were coded as 12 years.
Participants who attended college but did not receive 4 year degrees
were coded as 14 years, and participants who received 4 year degrees
and above were coded as 17 years.
Statistical analysis
SAS statistical software package version 9.2 was used for all analy-
ses. Before testing the hypothesis we assessed the association between
potential confounds using Pearson Correlation and multicollinear-
ity variance inflation factor and found multicollinarity to be within
acceptable levels (variance inflation factor <2.5 and tolerance >0.40).
All analyses were run utilizing weights provided by NHANES. Mean
comparisons were run to examine differences in IR
HOMA
and CRP
between the four body composition groups using a Bonferroni adjust-
ment to decrease the risk of a type I error. Because our dependent
variable is a count of the number of functioning problems, we used a
modified Poisson regression with robust error variances in our analy-
sis (20). Three sequential equations were used to first, examine the
association between physical functioning and body composition, and
then to evaluate whether differences in insulin resistance in the second
model and differences in inflammation in the third model partially
explain this relationship. Based on the coefficients from the Poisson
models, prevalence ratios (PRs) (relative risks), and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated. All analyses were done controlling for
possible confounders including age, race/ethnicity, sex, height, and
education.
Results
Sample description
Table 1 lists the descriptive characteristics of the sam-
ple. Just over half of the participants were female (56.2%).
Most of the sample were non-Hispanic white (81.6%). Non-
Hispanic blacks and Hispanics each made up 7.1 and 8.9% of
sample members respectively, while subjects of other race/
ethnic accounted for 2.4% of the sample. Mean education
was 12.5 years, and mean age was 70.6 years. ASM ranged
from 15.0­38.0%, with a mean of 25.4%. The range in waist
circumference was 64.8­149.6cm, with a mean of 99.3cm.
Mean IR
HOMA
and CRP were 3.80 and 5.34mg/l, respectively.
Most participants had relatively good physical functioning;
the mean sample score for functioning problems was 3.2,
with scores ranging from 0 to 18.
Approximately one-third (37.2%) of the participants met
criteria for classification as having healthy body composition,
3.6% were solely sarcopenic; 10.4% were sarcopenic obese and
largest percentage (48.8%) were solely obese.
Means for age, physical functioning, ASM, waist circumfer-
ence, insulin resistance, and CRP are provided by body com-
position category in Table 2. Sarcopenic nonobese subjects
were the oldest (77.8 years), followed by healthy subjects (71.0
years), sarcopenic obese subjects (70.9 years), and lastly non-
sarcopenic obese subjects (69.7). Overall, sarcopenic nonobese
subjects had the most physical functioning problems (8.2), fol-
lowed by those who were sarcopenic obese (4.4), nonsarco-
penic obese subjects (3.1), and healthy (2.4). When stratified
by sex, sarcopenic obese subjects had the highest waist circum-
ference in both males and females. Sarcopenic nonobese were
found to have the lowest muscle mass; however, it was practi-
cally equivalent to the ASM found among the sarcopenic obese
group.
Subjects who were sarcopenic obese also had the high-
est insulin resistance (mean IR
HOMA
= 6.1), followed by solely
obese subjects (4.5), solely sarcopenic subjects (3.1), and lastly,
subjects who were neither obese nor sarcopenic (2.2). Multiple
mean comparisons using a Bonferroni adjustment showed that
the four groups were all significantly different mean IR
HOMA
compared to one another. The highest CRP levels were found
among those who were solely sarcopenic (10.6mg/l), followed

obese (5.3mg/l), and finally those who were neither obese nor
sarcopenic (4.6mg/l). Mean comparisons showed that all four
groups had statistically distinct means for CRP, except for the
two obese groups which did not significantly differ from one
another.
Associations of body composition on physical functioning
problems
Given that the results from the regression analysis were found
to be very similar for both sexes and no interaction was found
when analyzing the data, regressions were run without strati-
fication by sex. Nevertheless, analysis was run using sex as
a control rather than a stratification variable, which did not
significantly alter any of our results when compared to sex-
specific findings. Table 3 shows the results from the three
Poisson regression models. In all three models the omitted or
reference category for the regression was the healthy group
of subjects--those who are neither sarcopenic nor obese. In
model 1, sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenic nonobesity and non-
sarcopenic obesity had significant (P < 0.05) positive associa-
tions with physical functioning problems. The PRs indicate
that physical functioning problems were 91% more likely for
sarcopenic obese (PR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.54­2.38; P < 0.001),
58% more likely for sarcopenic nonobese subjects (PR: 1.58;
95% CI: 1.15­2.17; P = 0.005), and 29% more likely for non-
sarcopenic obese subjects (PR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.10­1.51;
P = 0.002) relative to the healthy reference group. In addition,
increased age, lower education, being female, and being black
or Hispanic were also associated with having more physical
functioning problems.
Influence of insulin resistance and inflammation over
the association between body composition and
physical functioning
In model 2, when controlling for IR
HOMA
, physical function-
ing problems were still significantly more prevalent in the
three adverse body composition groups. Additionally, IR
HOMA
was found to positively relate to physical functioning. A one
unit increment in IR
HOMA
was associated with a 3% increase
in the PR of physical functioning problems (PR: 1.03; 95%
CI: 1.01­1.04; P < 0.001). Furthermore, variations in insu-
lin resistance appeared to influence the associations between
body composition and functioning, given that the inclusion
of IR
HOMA
into the model significantly reduced the power
of sarcopenic obesity and nonsarcopenic obesity to predict
physical functioning problems by 21 and 38%, respectively
(model 1 estimate sarcopenic obese:0.65; model 2 estimate
sarcopenic obese: 0.51) (model 1 estimate nonsarcopenic

obese:0.25; model 2 estimate nonsarcopenic obese: 0.16).
However, IR
HOMA
did not significantly reduce the power of
association between sarcopenic nonobesity and physical
functioning problems.
In model 3, CRP was found to be significantly associated with
physical functioning problems. One mg/l increment in CRP
level was associated with a 1% increase in the PR of physical
functioning problems (PR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00­1.01; P =.001).
However, unlike insulin resistance, CRP did not significantly
alter the power of any of the body composition groups to pre-
dict functioning problems.
Discussion
Our findings suggest that physical functioning problems are
higher in those with sarcopenic obesity, nonsarcopenic obes-
ity, and sarcopenic nonobesity. Furthermore, the association
between physical functioning problems and both obesity
groups, with and without sarcopenia may be related to vari-
ations in insulin resistance. The findings regarding body
composition and functioning are consistent with the work of
Baumgartner et al. which concluded that sarcopenic obesity
in older adults is associated with lower physical capacity in
comparison with normal/healthy older adults (7). The asso-
ciation between body composition and physical ability may be
a result of several factors which work to exacerbate function-
ing problems in the sarcopenic obese phenotype. First, age-
dependent adoption of a sedentary lifestyle may contribute
to added fat accumulation and muscle atrophy. Second, func-
tioning problems may arise as a result of added strain on mus-
cles and joints due to excess weight. Or third, excess adiposity
may impair muscle mass and quality on a physiological basis
through mechanisms influenced by systemic inflammation
and metabolic dysfunction. In the present study, the finding
that subjects who were either sarcopenic obese or nonsarco-
penic obese were found to have worse physical functioning
than those who were neither sarcopenic nor obese, may be
partially due to variations in insulin resistance among the body
composition groups. Obesity, primarily in the midsection,
has been found to associate with an increased risk of insulin
resistance, which may in turn exacerbate the development of
sarcopenia and disability with aging. It has been hypothesized
that obesity-related insulin resistance may impair the anabolic
effect of insulin to suppress protein breakdown and stimulate
muscle synthesis (21,22), resulting in a progressive decreases
in skeletal muscle mass.
Furthermore, the finding that obese subjects without sar-
copenia are at greater risk of functioning problems than
their nonobese counterparts could be due to adverse mus-
cle composition, which may not be apparent when meas-
uring muscle mass. Goodpaster et al. found that adipose
tissue which has infiltrated skeletal muscle mass is signifi-
cantly associated with insulin resistance in obese subjects
(23), while Visser et al. showed that increased fat infiltration
within muscles was associated with poorer lower extremity
performance (24). As a result, in future studies muscle com-
position may be an important component in understanding
the association between sarcopenia, obesity, disability, and
insulin sensitivity.
Finally, although the inclusion of CRP did not significantly
alter the association between physical functioning and body
composition, further investigation is needed. It has been sug-
gested that a key characteristic of sarcopenia is a heightened
inflammatory state, due to increased cytokine production and
oxidative stress (25). However, our null findings with regards
to sarcopenic obesity, sarcopenic nonobesity, and nonsarco-
penic obesity--states that should be signaled by even greater
levels of inflammation--may be due to our use of muscle mass
rather than strength in conceptualizing sarcopenia. In a study
by Schaap et al., higher levels of CRP and IL-6 were found to
be significantly associated with reductions in muscle strength
but not with reductions in muscle mass (26).
There are several limitations in the present study. First, the
use of cross-sectional data hindered our ability to test for medi-
ating factors or the temporality of our associations. Second,
our physical functioning variable relied solely on self-report
measures. This is noteworthy because reports of functioning
ability can be influenced by mood, opinion, apprehension,
condition, and strength (27). Consequently, this may alter the
impact of sarcopenia and obesity on the variable being exam-
ined. Fourth, the use of imputed data on measures for mus-
cle mass could be considered a limitation even though this is
the procedure recommended by NCHS. Nevertheless, analysis
run excluding imputed subjects yielded comparable results to
those reported. Fifth, CIs between the three body composition
groups overlapped indicating that these three groups did not
have distinctly different associations with physical function-
ing problems. Despite these limitations, the present study is
strengthened by the use of reliable techniques for measur-
ing body composition, biomarkers to measure insulin resist-
ance and inflammation, and t a large nationally representative
sample.
The current study demonstrated that insulin resistance is an
important factor in the association between abdominal obesity,
withandwithoutsarcopenia,andphysicalfunctioning.Because
functional disability is related to greater rates of injury, loss
of independence, chronic conditions, cognitive degeneration
and decreased life expectancy, it is essential for policy makers
to work towards the implementation of programs and strat-
egies that promote healthy aging and facilitate the reduction
in metabolic dysfunction and sarcopenic obesity among older
adults (28­31). In moving forward, further research using lon-
gitudinal data is needed to uncover the mechanisms that are
driving the progression of sarcopenic obesity and mediating its
relationship with disability and disease.
