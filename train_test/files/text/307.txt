ABSTRACT
Background: In the United States, black women are at much greater
risk of obesity than are black men. Little is known about the factors
underlying this disparity.
Objective: We explored whether childhood sociodemographic fac-
tors (parental education, single-mother household, number of sib-
lings, number of minors in household, birth order, and female
caregiver's age) were associated with the gender disparity in obesity
prevalence in young black adults in the United States.
Design: An analytic data set (n ¼ 7747) was constructed from the
nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health. Childhood sociodemographic factors were assessed in 1994­
1995 in nonimmigrant black and white youths aged 11­19 y. Obesity
was assessed in 2001­2002. For each childhood sociodemographic
factor, we evaluated whether the prevalence difference (female obe-
sity minus male obesity) was modified by the factor. We described
the contribution of each variable category to the overall prevalence
difference.
Results: In unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models, parental
education consistently modified gender disparity in blacks (P ¼ 0.01).
The gender gap was largest with low parental education (16.7% of
men compared with 45.4% of women were obese) and smallest with
high parental education (28.5% of men compared with 31.4% of
women were obese). In whites, there was little overall gender differ-
ence in obesity prevalence.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to document
that the gender disparity in obesity prevalence in young black adults is
concentrated in families with low parental education. In these low-
socioeconomic-status families, obesity development is either under the
control of distinct mechanisms in each gender, or men and women from
these households adopt different obesity-related behaviors. Am J

INTRODUCTION
It is well established that prevalence of obesity is higher in
black women than in black men (1, 2). In the 1999­2002 Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the
gender difference in obesity prevalence in blacks was 21.1
percentage points: 49.0% of black women were obese, whereas
only 27.9% of black men were obese (3). In contrast, there was
virtually no gender disparity in obesity prevalence in whites:
30.7% of white women were obese compared with 28.2% of
white men (3).
NHANES has monitored gender-specific obesity prevalence
for the past 35 y (4). During most of that time, the gender dis-
parity among US blacks remained stable at '15 percentage
points, but has increased to 20 percentage points in more recent
surveys (2, 4). Although this gender disparity is well docu-
mented, little is known about factors underlying the disparity: in
fact, we know of no studies that have investigated factors as-
sociated with this gender gap in obesity in blacks.
Because this gender disparity in obesity prevalence emerges in
childhood (2, 5), we hypothesized that the disparity observed in
young adults is associated with characteristics of the childhood
environment. Several sociodemographic characteristics of the
childhood family environment, such as parental education and
birth order, have been found to be associated with obesity risk in
adolescence and adulthood (5­17). We hypothesized that soci-
odemographic characteristics of the childhood family environ-
ment may differentially affect obesity risk in male and female
children (18) and thus affect the magnitude of the gender dis-
parity in obesity prevalence in black adults.
We were particularly interested in whether socioeconomic
status (SES) was associated with gender disparity in obesity. For

young black men and women in NHANES III (1988­1994), the
relations between SES and ``overweight/obesity'' (19) indicated
that the gender disparity would be larger in low-SES than in
high-SES black young adults. Nonetheless, a recent review
suggested that, between 1988­1994 and 1999­2000, the rela-
tions between SES and obesity reversed in black men and
women (20). This finding implied that the gender disparity
would be larger in high-SES than in low-SES black adults.
However, this more recent research focused on an older pop-
ulation. In younger adults, it remains unclear whether, in the
more recent time period, the gender disparity in obesity was
larger in low-SES or in high-SES blacks.
We used data from a nationally representative prospective
cohort study of adolescents followed into young adulthood to
investigate the associations between sociodemographic charac-
teristics of the childhood family environment and gender dis-
parity in obesity prevalence in young black adults in the United
States. We replicated all analyses in US whites to detect common
patterns in blacks and whites and to contextualize the disparities
observed in blacks.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Population
Data were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health). Add Health began as a nationally repre-
sentative survey of all US public and private school students
enrolled in grades 7 through 12. The Add Health survey focused
on adolescent risk behaviors and includes a wealth of behavior
data. The survey was cluster-sampled by school and also over-
sampled some subgroups, including black students with a parent
who had completed college or attained a professional degree.
In 1994­1995 (baseline), detailed questionnaires were admin-
istered to each student and to the student's primary in-residence
caregiver, preferentially a female. A year later, in 1995­1996, all
studentsexceptthosein12thgradeatbaselinewerere-interviewed.
In 2001­2002, 7 y after baseline, all study respondents who par-
ticipated in the 1994­1995 baseline visit were re-interviewed, and
height and weight were measured.
We restricted our sample to non-Hispanic blacks and whites, at
least one of whose parents was born in the United States. Race
was defined by a combination of child self-report and parent self-
report data (21). We restricted the sample to adolescents with
a US-born parent (22) because our theoretical framework pre-
sumed that shared cultural and historical experiences shape how
obesity-related beliefs, behaviors, and desired norms may be
transmitted differently to each gender. In immigrant families,
these constructs could be additionally influenced by the cultural
context of their parents' countries of origin. We also restricted
our analysis sample to those eligible to be interviewed at all
3 study time points, ie, those in the 12th grade in 1994­1995
were excluded. All study procedures were approved by the In-
stitutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Outcome
The main study outcome was the prevalence difference for
obesity (obesity prevalence in women minus that in men) at the
7-y follow-up visit. Obesity was defined as body mass index
(BMI; in kg/m2) 30 (23).
A prevalence difference of 0 repre-
sents an equal obesity prevalence for men and women, .0 in-
dicates that women were more likely to be obese, and
,0 indicates that men were more likely to be obese.
We considered modeling 6-y incidence rather than prevalence.
Incidence is advantageous when one is estimating causal asso-
ciations and seeks to exclude bias from reverse causation and
from confounding by differential outcome duration. However,
our intention was not to calculate causal estimates. Furthermore,
we believe that reverse causation and differential outcome du-
ration are of limited importance in this analysis. First, it is un-
likely or impossible that a child's obesity status would affect
parental education, family structure, female caregiver's age at
child's birth, number of minors in household, birth order, or
number of siblings. Second, obesity is generally a persistent state.
In Add Health, over a 6-y period, obesity was maintained 80­
90% of the time in black and white males and females (1). By
modeling prevalence, we produced estimates that can be directly
compared with other surveillance data and can be easily in-
corporated into estimates of public health burden.
Exposures and covariates
Exposurevariableswerederivedfromthebaseline(1994­1995)
interviews of respondents and their caregivers. Six exposure var-
iables were examined: number of full siblings (including re-
spondent), birth order, number of minors (age  18 y) living in the
respondent's household (including respondent), parental educa-
tion, family structure, and female caregiver's age at the time of the
respondent's birth. Both birth order and number of siblings were
defined in terms of the respondent's full sibship, ie, all children of
both respondents' biological parents. Parental education was de-
finedas thehighesteducationattainedbyeitheroftherespondent's
biological parents (5). We categorized family structure into 4
groups: household headed by single mother; by both biological
parents; by 2 parents, at least one of whom was nonbiological; and
other (22). Ninety-two percent of the identified female caregivers
reported being the respondents' biological mothers.
Other variables included in all multivariable models were
categorical age and the respondent's biological sex. Although we
use a variable for biological sex, our theoretical framework pre-
sumes that the obesity disparity observed between black men and
women results from both biological (``sex'') and cultural (``gen-
der'') influences (24). For lack of a more precise term, throughout
this article, we use the word ``gender'' to connote the confluence
of biological and cultural influences.
Exclusions
Overall, 78.3% of those eligible participated in the 7-y
follow-up (80.9% of black females, 71.2% of black males,
82.0% of white females, and 75.9% of white males). Of the
respondents, 7.7% were excluded from the present analysis.
About 5% of respondents were excluded because they were
missing baseline exposure information (4.6%), mostly female
caregiver's age at child's birth, which was missing for 3.6% of
respondents. Others were excluded because they were outside
the desired age range (0.01%), lived alone at baseline (0.2%),
were pregnant at the time of the follow-up visit [2.2% overall

(4.5% black women; 4.0% white women)], or were missing
measured and self-reported height or weight data (0.9%). Self-
reported height or weight was substituted for missing measured
data for 5.4% of respondents (7.2% of black females, 6.4% of
black males, 5.6% of white females, and 4.2% of white males).
The final analysis sample consisted of 2096 black and 5651
white respondents.
Data analysis
Effect modification of the prevalence difference
Our primary hypothesis was tested by examining whether there
was effect modification of the prevalence difference in obesity
by any of 6 exposure variables. Specifically, this analysis tested
whether the prevalence difference varied across categories of
each childhood sociodemographic factor. All sociodemographic
factors were analyzed as nominal categorical variables. We first
calculated obesity prevalence by race for each gender within each
exposure category. We then estimated the obesity prevalence
difference in each stratum of each exposure. Finally, effect
modification of the prevalence difference by each exposure was
tested by using modified Wald tests (25).
All estimates were corrected for Add Health's complex survey
design (25). Both unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted esti-
mates were calculated for all analyses (Stata 9; Stata Corp, Col-
lege Station, TX). To allow multivariable-adjusted associations to
vary independently by gender, all variable categories had inter-
actions with gender. Calculating adjusted prevalence estimates
from multivariable logistic regression models required us to set
model covariates to specific values (26). We chose to standardize
the multivariable-adjusted estimates to hypothetical race-strati-
fied populations with covariate distributions similar to those of the
sample population. For each race group, we set each covariate
category's value at the mean proportion of respondents in that
category over the 2 genderes (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, WA).
The one exception was respondent's age, for which data from the
2 race groups were combined before determining the mean pro-
portions. The delta method was used to calculate 95% CIs for
prevalence differences.
Because some of our 6 exposures were likely to be associated
with each other, we screened for multicollinearity. We used
bivariate multinomial logistic regression models with each var-
iable as an outcome and each of the other 5 variables separately as
an exposure. We found that female caregiver's age at the time of
the respondent's birth was strongly associated [odds ratio (OR) 
3.0] with most other exposure variables. To examine this further,
we ran multivariable models both including and excluding the
female caregiver's age variable. The estimates for other variables
changed very little, so we report estimates from multivariable
models including female caregiver's age at the time of the
respondent's birth.
We also observed a strong bivariate association (OR  3.0)
between birth order and number of siblings. To separate the
associations with birth order compared with those with the
number of siblings, we created joint variables that allowed us to
examine associations between prevalence differences in obesity
and either birth order or size of sibship while holding the other
factor constant. These analyses indicated that birth order was the
factor more strongly associated with differential obesity preva-
lence by gender (data not shown). Therefore, our final multi-
variable logistic regression models included gender, categorical
age, 5 exposure variables (excluding number of full siblings), and
gender interaction terms with all variables.
Decomposition of the prevalence difference
We used the Kitagawa decomposition technique to divide the
overallgenderdisparityintocomponentsduetodifferencesbetween
men and women in their stratum-specific obesity prevalences (27).
For each variable, the standard population was assigned the average
exposure distribution of the 2 gender groups. We modified the Ki-
tagawa method by dividing each stratum-specific component by the
sum of the absolute values of the stratum-specific components in-
stead of dividing by the overall prevalence difference. This ap-
proach simplifies interpretation when stratum-specific estimates
have different signs. In addition, this approach explores only dis-
parity due to differences in stratum-specific obesity prevalence by
gender, not that which may be due to men and women having dif-
ferent likelihoods of being in a given stratum. Any disparity due to
differences in the percentage of men and women in each stratum is
reflected in the difference between the overall gender disparity and
the sum of the stratum-specific components.
RESULTS
The mean age, obesity prevalence, and distributions of the
exposure variables across the 4 race-gender groups are shown in
Table 1. The distributions of the exposure variables differed
between blacks and whites but generally varied little between
males and females of the same race. As expected, obesity
prevalence was higher in black women than in black men: the
estimated prevalence difference was 11.9 percentage points
(95% CI: 7.0, 16.7). Among whites, there was no gender dif-
ference in obesity prevalence: the prevalence difference was
only 0.9 percentage points (95% CI: 21.9, 3.8).
The distributions of unadjusted prevalence differences across
the 6 exposure variables in whites and blacks are shown in Table
2. In blacks, the prevalence difference, or magnitude of black
women's excess obesity prevalence compared with black men,
was not uniform across the exposure variables. For instance,
the prevalence difference in blacks varied markedly depending
on parental education (P ¼ 0.01). In families in which neither
parent completed high school, obesity prevalence in black
women was 45.4% compared with only 16.7% in black men,
which corresponded to a large prevalence difference of 28.8
percentage points (Table 2). In contrast, in blacks with at least
one parent with a college degree, the prevalence difference was
only 2.9 percentage points. There was also some statistical
evidence that the gender disparity in blacks varied with birth
order (P ¼ 0.11). Because tests of modification are weakly
powered and therefore prone to type II error, cutoffs as high as
0.20 are often recommended to identify variation in an effect
measure (28­30). In whites, the prevalence difference did not
vary across any exposures to the same degree as it did for
parental education in blacks, but the prevalence difference in
whites did tend to vary with parental education (P ¼ 0.05), age
of female caregiver (P ¼ 0.08), and birth order (P ¼ 0.14).
Multivariable-adjusted prevalence differences are shown in
Figure 1, A­E. The overall multivariable-adjusted prevalence
differences for blacks and whites were 12.5 percentage points

(95% CI: 7.8, 17.2) and 0.4 percentage points (95% CI: 22.4,
3.3), respectively. These prevalence differences are indicated on
the figures by the dashed lines. The P values associated with
Figure 1 (A­E) are from tests of the association between each
sociodemographic factor and the gender disparity in obesity
prevalence: the tests evaluated whether the prevalence difference
varied between categories of each exposure variable. The most
striking association with the obesity gender disparity was found
for parental education in blacks (Figure 1A; P ¼ 0.01). The
prevalence difference was greatest among those whose parents
did not complete high school and was smallest among those with
a parent who completed college. In whites, as in blacks, the
overall trend was that women from the lowest-educated families
had a higher risk of obesity risk than did men from similar fam-
ilies. In whites, the test for effect modification of the prevalence
difference in obesity by parental education was statistically

significant in unadjusted (Table 2) but not in multivariable-
adjusted models (P ¼ 0.34).
For 2 other sociodemographic exposures, there were sugges-
tions of associations with the gender difference in obesity prev-
alence. Birth order appeared somewhat associated with gender
difference in both blacks and whites (Figure 1E). Having a female
caregiver who was relatively young (18 y at the time of the
respondent's birth) or relatively old (35 y old at the time of the
respondent's birth) appeared to be associated with a higher
prevalence of obesity for white women than for their white male
counterparts (Figure 1C).
Results from the decomposition analyses are shown in Table
3. Blacks from the lowest parental-education families repre-
sented ,20% of the population but contributed .40% of the
gender gap in obesity in blacks ('5 percentage points). In
contrast, black children of college graduates also made up
'20% of the population but contributed only '5% of the
gender gap (,1 percentage point). In earlier analyses, whites
from families in which parents did not complete high school also
appeared to show a gender gap in obesity. However, this group
made up less than 10% of the white population and thus con-
tributed only '1 percentage point of gender disparity.

DISCUSSION
We used an innovative methodologic approach to directly
study the gender disparity in obesity prevalence in young black
adults in the United States. To our knowledge, this study was the
first to examine family factors as possible correlates of the gender
gap in obesity prevalence in blacks. Parental education was the
only sociodemographic variable that was strongly associated with
the gender disparity in obesity in blacks. In fact, nearly half of the
overall gender gap was concentrated among the one-fifth of
young black adults whose parents did not complete high school.
Whereas young black women from low-education families were
at the greatest risk of obesity, young black men from these same
families appeared to be at the lowest risk.
Although US research addressing gender disparities in obesity
prevalence is scarce, there is a body of relevant work examining
international differences in obesity prevalence (31­35). The
association between SES and obesity varies both by gender and
by a country's degree of economic development [as assessed by
the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI)] (35).
For men in poor, low-HDI nations, SES is positively associated
with obesity; studies of men in medium-HDI nations (eg, Brazil
and Saudi Arabia) find fewer positive associations and more null
associations; and in men from high-HDI nations (eg, the United
States and Australia), null and negative associations are most
common. Women in low-HDI and medium-HDI countries tend
to show trends similar to those observed for men, but, in high-

HDI countries, negative associations are more common in
women than in men (35).
Our findings for whites conformed to patterns observed for
high-HDI countries, but our findings for blacks did not. The
gender disparity in young black adults more closely resembled
the profile of a medium-HDI country, where obesity prevalence is
usually much higher in women than in men (32, 36). Within
medium-HDI and high-HDI nations, historical subgroups can be
classified as living in contexts less developed than the larger
nation's because the subgroup is not fully integrated into the
nation's social and economic systems (33, 35). As in American
Indians in the United States or in Maoris in New Zealand, black
Americans in the high-HDI United States could be classified as
living in a medium-HDI context: legally sanctioned mechanisms
barred them from full participation in American social and
economic life until well into the 20th century (37).
Moreover, the divergent associations between SES and obesity
that we observed in young US blacks (men: positive; women:
inverse) resemble those of a medium-HDI country in the midst of
rapid nutrition transition. In these countries, the obesity burden
shifts from high-SES individuals to low-SES individuals (34),
and this shift generally occurs in women before it occurs in men
(31, 34, 38). Thus, the prevalence of obesity in women may be
inversely associated with SES, while the prevalence of obesity in
men may retain its positive association. Furthermore, as obesity
prevalence stabilizes or decreases among women of high SES, it
may continue to increase among men, causing the gender gap to
decrease. However, over the past 35 y, the magnitude of the
gender disparity in obesity among US black adults has not de-
creased (2, 4). Further research should explore whether the
obesity patterns of black Americans conform to the model ob-
served in rapidly developing medium-HDI nations.
Our results appear to differ from conclusions reached by
a recent review, which argued that, in blacks with less than a high
school education, women had a lower and men had a higher
prevalence of obesity relative to other black adults of the same
gender (20). This conclusion was based largely on Zhang and
Wang's analysis of the 1999­2000 NHANES data set (39).
Several aspects of that analysis differed from ours. Most notably,
the 1999­2000 NHANES analysis studied adults aged 20­60 y
(39), whereas the average age of our cohort was '21 y; a pre-
vious study found age differences in the gender-specific rela-
tions between obesity and SES for young black adults aged
,30 y relative to older black adults (19). In addition, the 1999­
2000 NHANES analysis (39) used ORs, whereas we used
prevalence differences; they examined an adult's own educa-
tional attainment whereas we used parental education; their ed-
ucation categories (9th grade, 10th­12th grade, and college or
higher) differed from ours (,12th grade, some college, college
degree, and higher than college); and their sample of blacks was
smaller than ours, which resulted in more unstable estimates.
Our analysis was not without limitations. First, we examined
a narrow age range within young adulthood; therefore, our
findings may not generalize to older adults. Second, we did not
investigate the respondent's adult SES independent of his or her
parents' educational attainment; the age range examined is
a highly complex transitional period, in which it is difficult to
classify SES independent of family of origin. Third, we were
limited in using preexisting data. For instance, family structure
and number of minors in the household were only examined
during adolescence; perhaps examination at a younger age or of
cumulative exposure over a longer period would have produced
different results. Furthermore, comparedwith tests ofmain effects
in data sets of the same size, tests of modification tend to have
relatively low power, which would increase the likelihood of
failing to detect an association (28, 29, 40, 41). Finally, there was
a possibility of differential selection bias by gender, especially
among blacks. Only students enrolled in school were eligible for
the study, and black males drop out of school at a higher rate than
do black females. In addition, fewer black male respondents than
female respondents were retained in the young adult follow-up
sample. However, the Add Health sample weights were designed
to account for this differential loss-to-follow-up.
Our study had many strengths. To our knowledge, Add Health
is the only nationally representative data set with an adequate
sample size and diversity of variables suitable for this work.
Furthermore, blacks with college-educated parents were over-
sampled, which allowed us to produce relatively precise estimates
for parental education. In addition, we had access to both in-
dividual-level (reported by the respondents) and household-level
(reported by the respondents as well as their parents) variables,
which is rare in a study of this size. Height and weight data were
measured by trained staff; there is evidence that associations
between obesity and SES differ when anthropometric data are
self-reported rather than measured (35). Additionally, retention
rates were good over the 7-y follow-up period. Finally, our
analysis of effect modification of prevalence differences allowed
us to make meaningful comparisons across race and across ex-
posure variables.
It remains a puzzle why black boys and girls from similar
genetic, family, and community backgrounds have such different
risks of developing obesity by young adulthood. In low-SES
families, it is apparent that black sons and daughters either adopt
very different and gender-specific obesity-related behaviors or that
obesity development occurs through different mechanisms for
these young women and men. We found that parental education,
but not other examined family factors, strongly predicted the
degree to which obesity prevalence differed by gender. Perhaps,
community characteristics related to SES are more important than
within-family dynamics in explaining the gender difference in
obesity prevalence in young adults. Future research on the causes
underlying the decades-old gender difference in obesity prevalence
among US blacks should examine mechanisms by which behav-
ioral and community characteristics of blacks from low-SES
families may differentially affect obesity risk in males and females
during adolescence and young adulthood.
