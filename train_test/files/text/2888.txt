Abstract
This paper estimates the exporter premium in bank lending. We examine credit relationships
in Germany, covering all loans of more than 1.5 million euro over the period from 2005 to
2010. Having controlled for a wide range of other firm and bank characteristics, our results
indicate that exporting firms take out loans around 15 percent larger than those of non-
exporters.

I. Introduction
The recent literature on international trade documents (and emphasizes) sizable trade-
related differences across firms. Firms not only vary strongly by trade activity; typically, only
a small fraction of a countrys firms engage in exports and imports. More notably, firms that
export also differ significantly from non-exporters in (almost) all other relevant firm
characteristics. Exporters are larger in size, more productive and pay higher wages than non-
exporters; see, for instance, Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007). Exporters also tend
to produce a wider range of products and are less likely to cease operations; see Bernard and
Jensen (2007).
In this short paper, we examine the difference between exporters and non-exporters
along another dimension: access to (and use of) bank credit. The dramatic decline in world
trade in 2008/2009 after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (`Great Trade Collapse') has led
to a growing interest in the procedures of trade financing, highlighting the role of financial
factors for trade activity. We aim to describe the association between finance and cross-border
trade in further detail, analyzing empirically to what extent the provision of bank loans is
affected by firm-specific characteristics, including the firm's export status.
Our analysis is based on a novel data set of bank-firm relationships in Germany.
Specifically, we match information from the German credit register (which covers the credit
exposure of banks towards individual borrowers) with detailed balance sheet data on the
borrower. The resulting, newly-compiled data set has, for our purposes, three key advantages.
First, the database covers all large-scale credit relationships in Germany. Since lenders are
required by law to report their credit exposure with a borrower exceeding a certain threshold
to the German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, our results are derived from a full
sample of bank-firm credit linkages. Second, due to the pair-wise structure of the credit
register, the lender is properly identified. This structure allows controlling directly for bank-
specific features of credit provision such as differences in lending policies or profitability.
Third, the balance sheet data covers, along with other firm data, information on the
borrowers' foreign sales. Based on this data, we compute measures of a firm's (aggregate)
export activity.
Previewing our results, we find large exporter premia in bank lending. Our estimates
indicate, for instance, that German exporting firms take, on average, 15 percent larger loans
2
than non-exporters, holding constant for other factors. To the extent that we properly control
for firm-specific determinants of access to external finance, these findings appear to provide
broad support for the trade finance channel between banks and exporters which suggests that
exports are particularly sensitive to financial conditions. Amiti and Weinstein (2011), for
instance, emphasize that international trade involves higher default risk and higher working
capital requirements; exporters rarely properly evaluate default risk (turning instead to banks
to provide insurance) and need more working-capital financing because of long delivery
times.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant
literature. In Section 3, we describe our empirical approach and the data, followed by a
presentation of the empirical results. Finally, Section 4 provides a brief conclusion.
II. Literature
A (by now) sizable empirical literature identifies economically large and statistically
significant differences between firms that export and firms selling exclusively on the domestic
market. Many studies re-examine and strongly confirm this finding for a broad range of
indicators of firm activity. There are also a large number of papers which aim to replicate this
observation for various countries, obtaining similarly affirmative results.1
For Germany, our country of interest, Bernard and Wagner (1997) document sizable
and robust exporter premia for various plant characteristics. Based on a regional sample of
firms, they find that German exporting plants are more productive than non-exporters (with a
premium of about 20 percent), have a higher capital intensity (by about 12 percent) and invest
more per worker (about 8 percent) than non-exporters; firms also employ more workers and
pay higher wages, with the premia varying by the type of worker. Holding constant for the
characteristics of both the worker and the workplace, Schank, Schnabel and Wagner (2007)
estimate that employees working in a plant with an export-sales ratio of 60 percent earn about
1-2 percent more than similar employees in otherwise identical non-exporting plants. Finally,
export activity is also associated with measures of firm performance and firm success; Fryges
and Wagner (2010) argue that exporting has a positive causal effect on profitability.
1 Given that relevant firm-level data sets often differ in design across countries and are not
always readily accessible, few surveys seek to combine and summarize findings for various
countries; see, for instance, Mayer and Ottaviano (2007).
3
The role of financial variables for firm export behavior, by contrast, was initially
emphasized primarily in theory. Building on the assumption that entry into foreign markets
involves sunk costs, it is hypothesized that only firms with (access to) sufficient financial
resources are able to start exporting. Chaney (2005) and Manova (2006), among others,
formalize this idea, adding liquidity constraints to a standard heterogeneous firm model of
international trade. Specifically, Chaney (2005, p. 5) argues that "one [additional] dimension
of heterogeneity along which exporters may differ from non-exporters is their ability to access
financial intermediaries", with less financially constrained firms being more likely to export.
The few empirical studies which aim to analyze the exporter premium for financial
variables typically find evidence in support of this hypothesis.2 However, since these studies
often examine measures of the financial health of firms, such as firm liquidity, they seem to
provide only limited insights. For one thing, financial health, which is the most
comprehensive outcome measure of a firm's business policies, depends on many factors,
including the decision to export itself. In fact, given the seemingly robust finding of
significant differences in financial positions between exporters and non-exporters, the
empirical analysis mainly focuses on causality, with mixed results. Analyzing a panel of
British manufacturing firms over the period from 1993 to 2003, Greenaway, Guariglia, and
Kneller (2007) find that participation in export markets improves firms' financial health,
while export starters display low liquidity. In contrast, Bellone, Musso, Nesta, and Schiavo
(2010) find for a sample of French firms that exporters are already more liquid before entry,
with no further growth in financial variables relative to non-exporters in the following years.
More notably, measures of financial health are, at best, only a very imperfect proxy for
the variable of interest, access to external finance. For instance, a large stock of liquidity may
reflect weak fundamentals rather than easy credit when firms are forced to hoard cash in times
of financial constraints. As a result, the association between a firm's financial position and its
access to external financial funds seems to be generally ambiguous.
2 A related literature in finance explores the capital structure decisions of firms, including the
use of external finance. For instance, examining a broad range of financing sources, Beck,
Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2008) find that exporters tend to use more bank, leasing
and supplier finance.
4
The special importance of external financial conditions for international trade
activities has been further highlighted in recent research on the `Great Trade Collapse'. The
sharp decline in world trade in 2008/2009 is widely attributed to a drop in the provision of
trade finance by troubled financial intermediaries in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
Ahn, Amiti and Weinstein (2011) provide suggestive evidence, showing that the prices of
seaborne-shipped goods, which are likely to be most dependent on trade credit, rose relative
to the prices of goods sent by alternative modes of transportation. In similar fashion, Chor and
Manova (2012) document that countries with tighter credit markets exported less to the
United States between September 2008 and August 2009, with the effect being especially
pronounced in sectors that require extensive external financing; see also Levchenko, Lewis,
and Tesar (2010).3 Analyzing bank-firm relationships in Japan, Amiti and Weinstein (2011)
find that the health of banks providing finance affects the growth in their client's exports
relative to its domestic sales.
III. Methodology and Data
In this paper, we aim to describe trade-related bank-firm relationships in more detail,
focusing in particular on the role of external finance for foreign sales. To identify possible
differences in bank lending between exporters and non-exporters, we run regressions of the
following general form:
(1) ln(Loanijkt
)=  +  Exporterijt
+ {  Xijt
} + j
+ t
+ ijkt
where Loanijkt
is a measure of the credit exposure of bank k to firm i in industry j at time t,
Exporter is a measure of the firm's export activity, typically a dummy variable that takes the
value of one if a firm has positive foreign sales (and zero otherwise), X covers a number of
other firm characteristics (such as firm size),  and  are comprehensive sets of industry-
specific and time fixed effects, respectively, and  is the residual. Bernard, Jensen, Redding,
and Schott (2007) use a similar approach to quantify exporter premia for other firm
characteristics. As potentially relevant firm-specific variables for lending other than export
status, we consider total sales, the number of employees, firm age, equity, foreign equity
holdings, and whether the firm operates more than one plant. In addition, we experiment with
3 For a contrasting view, see Bricongne, Fontagné, Gaulier, Taglioni, and Vicard (2012). They
find, for a sample of French firms, that the financial crisis particularly hit firms in sectors
highly dependent on external finance, but conclude that the overall impact of credit
constraints on trade has been limited.
5
the inclusion of controls for firm location (federal state), the legal form of the firm, and the
lending entity (bank). In our most demanding specification, we also use a comprehensive set
of firm-specific fixed effects, thereby identifying the association between exports and lending
from the variation in a firm's export status over time only.
We estimate equation (1) for bank-firm relationships in Germany, using quarterly data
for the period from 2005 to 2010. Our main source of data is the Deutsche Bundesbank's
credit register, named MiMiK, which contains information on all loans in excess of
1.5 million euro granted by banks in Germany to firms worldwide. According to section 14 of
the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz), banking institutions based in Germany are
required to report their large exposures on a quarterly basis to allow the central bank to
monitor indebtedness; Schmieder (2006) provides a more detailed description of the
database.4 For each bank-firm relationship, the size and composition of the credit exposure
(both on and off balance sheet) is provided, along with the name and address of the borrower
as well as information on the lender.
We match loans with (annual) balance sheet data for the borrower from the corporate
balance sheets database of the Bundesbank, Ustan. The Bundesbank has collected, mainly for
refinancing purposes, extensive data on individual firms; the data are primarily extracted from
annual accounts and financial statements submitted directly to the Bundesbank.5 Most notably
for our purposes, the database includes information on firms' export sales. Since the firm
identifiers differ between the two data sets, we match the data using a propensity score
matching algorithm, based on the name, the legal form and the location of the firm; see
Goldbach and Nitsch (2013) for a more detailed description.
Table 1 presents a brief overview of the data. In total, the Bundesbank's credit register
contains information on almost 1 million bank-firm pairs for the 24 quarters from 2005
through 2010. For the large majority of the more than 14,800 loan-taking firms in the data set,
we also have complementary information on firm characteristics. In fact, we lose only about
4 The German credit register was initially established in 1934, but reporting requirements
were occasionally adjusted to take account of inflation (raising the regulatory reporting
threshold) and structural changes in banking and financing techniques (e.g., adding credit
derivatives to the definition of credit exposure).
5 As Stöss (2001, p. 132) notes, these accounts are used for an examination of the
creditworthiness of parties to bills of exchange, since the Bundesbank Act requires the central
bank to purchase bills "backed by parties known to be solvent".
6
20 percent of the total number of (loan-quarter) observations through our matching procedure.
Most notably, the matched data set does not differ significantly from the full credit register
data. For instance, the pair-wise credit exposure consistently averages at about 8 million euro.
IV. Empirical Results
Firm-specific information on large-scale loans by financing entity allows identifying
directly the exporter premium in external finance. Benchmark estimation results are tabulated
in Table 2. Each of the four columns reports the results of a different regression specification
of equation (1), gradually increasing the number of additional explanatory variables to control
for differences in bank lending across firms.
Column (1) presents our default specification, in which we regress the log value of a
banks credit exposure to a firm on the export status of the borrower, holding constant for
differences in lending relationships across (two-digit) industries and over time. The estimated
() coefficient on the exporter dummy takes a significantly positive sign; the effect is also
economically large. According to our most parsimonious specification of equation (1), the
point estimate of  indicates that being an exporter tends to increase the credit exposure of a
firm by, on average, about 37 percent.
The next two columns show that about one-half of this effect is explained by firm
characteristics other than export participation. In column (2), we control for size, age and
structure of the firm; in column (3), we additionally include fixed effects for the location and
legal form of the firm as well as lender-specific fixed effects. While the estimated 
coefficients on the auxiliary variables take on the expected sign and are statistically and
economically significant, with larger and older firms taking more loans whereas multi-plant
firms and firms with access to foreign capital often use alternative sources of financing, the
estimated  coefficient falls to about 0.15. These estimates suggest that exporters take about
15 percent larger loans than non-exporters, holding other things constant.
In a final perturbation, we add to our specification a comprehensive set of firm-
specific fixed effects. Since this estimator takes account of all time-invariant firm
characteristics and, thus, exploits only variations in factors over time, the association between
external finance and trade is exclusively identified from switches in a firm's trade activities.
Unfortunately, there are only few changes in the exporter status of firms in our sample; we
7
observe 23,626 episodes (of firm-bank pairs) in which a firm starts exporting and 19,797
export stops (representing, in total, a fraction of 5.4 percent of our sample of about 800,000
observations).6 Still, the estimate of  remains positive and significant, again indicating that
foreign sales are positively associated with bank lending. Specifically, the point estimate of
0.02 implies that a financial institution tends to increase its credit exposure to a firm that
becomes an exporter by about 2 percentage points.
We perform extensive sensitivity analyses. Table 3 provides some of our robustness
checks and extensions. Again, there are four columns (on the left of the table) which contain
parameter estimates; each of these columns tabulates the result of a different regression
specification, corresponding exactly to those of Table 2. To economize on space, however, we
only report estimates for the coefficient of interest ; that is, the specifications now also vary
across rows such that each cell of the table presents the result of a separate regression. The
column on the right of the table reports the number of observations since sample sizes differ.
We begin by varying our measure of export activity, replacing the plain export dummy
with the log share of foreign sales in total sales.7 We also experiment with using employment
instead of sales as our proxy for firm size or adding a separate control for firm productivity.8
Reassuringly, none of these perturbations has a qualitative effect on our results. Next, we split
the sample into two sub-periods, showing that the exporter premium has become smaller since
the beginning of the financial crisis. However, while the magnitude of the decline depends on
the exact regression specification, our finding that exporters take out significantly larger loans
than otherwise identical non-exporters remains consistently unchanged. We also split our
sample along other lines. For instance, examining results by credit exposure indicates that
censoring should not be an issue; the point estimates of  turn out to be particularly strong for
firms with low credit exposure. Similarly, when we divide the total credit exposure into direct
credit debt and off-balance sheet liabilities the results become slightly less robust; our
estimates indicate that the exporter premium in bank lending is mainly due to an exporting
6 Since all firm-specific information, including data on exporting, is only available at annual
frequency, we cannot identify the exact quarter of the switch in exporting status. Therefore,
we attribute the switch to all (four) quarters in the year of the change.
7 Before taking logs, we increase foreign sales by the value of one to deal with the problem of
zero entries.
8 We compute a productivity measure, the ratio of value added to the number of employees,
from accessible firm-level information in the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics;
see also Müller and Buch (1986).
8
firm's access to a wider range of financing instruments. The specification seems to become
even more demanding, with mixed estimation results, when we use credit shares instead of
credit values as dependent variable.9 Finally, our benchmark estimates remain essentially
unaffected when we use lagged explanatory variables or allow for time-variant industry and
bank fixed effects.10
Despite their overall consistency, our estimation results are still subject to limitations.
For instance, a potential issue might be omitted variables bias. The estimated exporter
premium may be mainly due to characteristics of the exporting firm (some of which are
potentially unobserved) rather than the nature of the export activities, a critique that appears to
be generally less relevant for our specification which includes firm fixed effects. Further, loan
size may be affected by the frequency of transactions for which we have, unfortunately, no
data. An obvious issue, open for future research, is to establish causality.
V. Conclusions
The sudden stand-still in world trade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in
September 2008 has led to growing interest in procedures of trade finance. A growing body of
evidence seems to suggest that export-related activities of firms indeed depend
disproportionately on finance from external sources.
This paper contributes to this recent literature by examining differences in bank
lending between exporters and non-exporters. Examining a novel data set of credit
relationships in Germany covering all loans of more than 1.5 million euro over the period
from 2005 to 2010, we find that exporting firms take, on average, about 15 percent larger
loans than non-exporters, holding constant for a wide range of other firm and bank
characteristics.
The sensitivity of export activities to the availability (and the cost) of external capital
has clear policy implications. A reduction in access to trade credit (and a tightening of credit
9 In particular, it should be noted that our data set covers credit exposure at the bank-firm
level.
10 It might be argued, for instance, that banks used primarily by non-exporters have been
differently affected by the financial crisis than banks that provide finance primarily to
exporting firms. We thank a referee for making this point. To deal with the extremely large
number of fixed effects, we apply the algorithm from Guimarães and Portugal (2010).

conditions) is likely to hit hard on financially vulnerable export industries. As a result, policy
measures and interventions that improve the strength of the domestic banking and financial
sector and, thereby, help avoiding financial market disruptions are expected to have a
measurable impact on a country's international trade.
