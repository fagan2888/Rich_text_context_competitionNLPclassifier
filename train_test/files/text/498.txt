Abstract
OBJECTIVE
The paper examines changes in the relationship between employment and household
tasks of Japanese couples, using data drawn from national cross-sectional surveys in
1994, 2000, and 2009 of persons aged 20­49, and from the 2009 follow-up of the 2000
survey.
RESULTS
Wives' employment is structured by their husbands' employment time and earning
power, as well as by their family situations, including the presence and age of children
and co-residence with parents. Housework hours of husbands, though very low,
increased over time, while wives' hours decreased. Wives' housework time decreases
as their employment time increases. Marriage dramatically increases women's
housework time but produces little change in men's time. Husbands' housework hours
are positively correlated with reported marital satisfaction of both spouses.

1. Introduction
Using repeated cross-sectional surveys and a longitudinal survey in Japan, we document
changes in couples' time spent on employment and household tasks and the relationship
between these, as well as the relationship of wives' employment with husbands'
housework time, and of wives' housework time with husbands' employment time. By
examining the complex of relationships in the gender allocation of employment and
household tasks, this study helps further our understanding of the changing gender roles
in Japan, a post-industrial country with dramatically different cultural heritage from the
West.
2. Conceptual framework
Our analysis is guided by the conceptual framework presented in Figure 1. The main
focus is on the time allocation of employment and household tasks of spouses:
specifically, the relationships between (1) wives' employment and their own housework
time, (2) husbands' employment time and their own housework time, (3) spouses'
employment time, (4) spouses' housework time, (5) wives' employment and husbands'
housework time, and (6) wives' housework time and husbands' employment time. Note
that arrows run both ways in these complex relationships, as each path is likely
reciprocal. The two smaller rectangles point to micro factors affecting employment and
housework time, and the ovals call attention to elements of the broader context within
which the interplay of employment and housework occurs. It is particularly important to
note that any of these contextual factors may affect any of the key analytical variables
indirectly, through the network of relationships represented.
3. Data and measures
We use replicated cross-sectional data drawn from three surveys: the 1994 National
Survey of Work and Family Life (NSWFL), and the 2000 and 2009 National Surveys
on Family and Economic Conditions (NSFEC). The 1994 NSWFL is a nationally
representative sample of 2,447 Japanese men and women aged 20­59 (see Tsuya and
Bumpass 2004). The 2000 NSFEC is a national probability sample of 4,482 Japanese
men and women aged 20­49 (see Rindfuss et al. 2004). Of these, 2,356 responded to a
2009 follow-up. There were 3,112 respondents to the 2009 NSFEC new cross-section.
The same questionnaire was used in the two surveys in 2009. Weights are used for the
Tsuya et al.: Employment and household tasks of Japanese couples, 1994­2009
2000 and 2009 cross-sections to account for oversampling of ages 20­39 and
differential response rates by age, sex, and size of place of residence. The 1994 data are
restricted to ages 20­49 to match the age limits of the 2000 and 2009 cross-sectional
surveys.
In all the surveys, married respondents were asked to provide reports for
themselves and for their spouses on objective information, including the hours and
schedules of employment, time spent on core household tasks, and basic characteristics
such as age and education. This paper focuses on two central dimensions of the gender
division of labor: employment time and housework time. Time spent on childcare was
not included in the housework time estimates because this variable is difficult to
measure since parents are often doing other things while simultaneously watching
children (Coltrane 2000; Ferree 1990; Thompson and Walker 1989).

4. Couples' employment
Despite the prolonged economic stagnation since the early 1990s, the employment rate
and hours of Japanese husbands in their prime working years appear not to have
changed much over the 15 years under study. On average, they work about 50­51 hours
per week, and around half work 49 hours or more. This long average workweek is an
important factor to consider in evaluating gender differences in time spent on
housework (Jacobs and Gerson 2004).
Wives' employment rate increased modestly from around 58% in 1994 to 62% in
2000 and reached a plateau thereafter, but the mean work hours of employed wives
declined from 36 hours per week in 1994 to 34 hours in 2000, and to 32 hours in 2009.
This decline was due primarily to increases in the proportion of wives working fewer
than 35 hours per week and decreases in the proportion of those working 42 hours or
more. Women working less than 35 hours per week are likely to hold temporary
employment while those working 42 hours or more are likely to hold regular
employment. Hence, the employment circumstances of Japanese wives of reproductive
ages appear to have deteriorated--whether by choice or as a consequence of the
restructuring of the labor market.
Table 1 presents the percentage employed and the mean work hours of employed
wives by husbands' employment hours and income, as well as by age of youngest child
and co-residence with parents. Aside from the few husbands who work the unusual
schedule of less than 35 hours weekly (who are often ill or older), wives work fewer
hours if their husbands work longer hours or have higher income. The association with
husband's income became stronger over time. In 2009, 67% were employed among
wives whose husbands earned the least, compared to 57% of those whose husbands
earned the most. This is what we would expect as wives likely enter the workforce to
help their households financially (Kohara 2010).
As expected, wives' employment is strongly associated with their family
circumstances. By 2009, the proportion employed ranged from a low of 36% among
mothers of children under age 3 to 75% among those with school-age children. At the
same time, it is notable that the employment of mothers of children under age 3 is as
high as it is, and that it increased substantially (from 28% to 36%) over the 15 years
under study. Work hours of employed wives are not as clearly related to ages of
children, though those with no children under age 18 have longer workweeks. Perhaps
reflecting the availability of childcare, mothers are much more likely to be employed if
they are co-residing with parents (73% versus 58% in 2009), and also work
significantly longer hours.

5. Couples' housework time and combined workload
The upper panel of Table 2 presents the mean hours that wives and husbands spent each
week on household tasks and husbands' average share of couples' task hours in 1994,
2000, and 2009. As expected, there is a very large gender difference in the hours
spouses spend on housework at all three time points. While wives spent roughly 30
hours per week on household tasks, husbands spent only 2 to 3 hours on such tasks.
Even though women universally spend more time on housework than men (Geist and
Cohen 2011; Gershuny 2000), the Japanese difference is extreme.

Statistical significance of change over time in spouses' housework hours and combined workload is estimated using the OLS
or logistic regression models where time is the only predictor variable. Year 2000 is the reference category, and
a "*" indicates significance at 5-percent level.
At the same time, we also see signs of modest change in the gender difference in
housework time. Wives' average housework time declined substantially from around 33
hours per week in 1994 to 29 hours in 2000, and to 27 hours in 2009, while the
Tsuya et al.: Employment and household tasks of Japanese couples, 1994­2009
http://www.demographic-research.org 711
corresponding time for husbands increased from 2.3 to 2.7 to 3.4 hours. Consequently,
husbands' share in couples' housework time increased from 7% to 9% to 12%. These
changes are as expected and all in the direction of gender balance, but the level of
husbands' housework time nonetheless remains low and the absolute amount of
increase in husbands' contributions is very small. Therefore the increase in husbands'
share of household tasks is primarily due to wives' reduction in their housework time,
rather than to increases in husbands' contributions. We also examined changes in
spouses' hours and husbands' share in each core task and found that they followed the
same trends as those in the total task hours.
There was, however, a sizable decline in the proportion of husbands who do no
housework: from 42% in 1994 to 22% in 2009. Japanese husbands seem to be
increasingly drawn into the domestic arena traditionally considered as female, crossing
the symbolic gender barrier associated with doing housework.
Not surprisingly, similar to Western countries (Geist 2010), Japanese spouses
differ in the reported hours that husbands spend doing housework. There is remarkable
agreement with respect to the average hours wives work around the house (less than an
hour difference), but considerable disagreement about whether husbands do any
housework at all: in 2009, 25% of wives said their husbands did no housework,
compared to the 18% reported by husbands. A small effort on the part of a husband may
seem important to him in light of traditional expectations, but may be regarded as no
help at all from the perspective of his wife. Nonetheless, both wives and husbands
report a substantial decline between 1994 and 2009 in the proportions of husbands
doing no housework. The truth may well lie in between the reports of both spouses, but
the average is low enough that the difference matters little.
As shown in the lower panel of Table 2, when housework and employment hours
are considered jointly, the large gender inequality we saw in the division of household
labor disappears, and the gender balance becomes slightly more favorable toward
wives: husband's average share of the combined workload increases from 51% in 1994
to 54% in 2009. When we limit our analysis to dual-earner couples, however, the
gender division of combined workload remains unfavorable toward women, although
the gender gap has narrowed.
6. Couples' employment and housework time
In all three study years, the average number of hours that wives spent doing housework
was much higher among those who were not employed compared to those who were
working full-time (31 versus 21 hours in 2009) (see Table 3). Even though wives
reduce their own housework hours as their employment time increases, the amount of
Demographic Research: Volume 27, Article 24
712 http://www.demographic-research.org
reduction does not come close to matching the corresponding increase in their
employment hours. Consequently, wives' hours in housework and employment
combined rise dramatically as their labor-market time goes up, reflecting the "second
shift" of wives employed full-time (Hochschild 1991). While mean differences in
housework hours between non-employed wives and those employed full-time are large,
husbands' housework time increases only modestly (by 1­2 hours per week) when their
wives are employed full-time.

The main story in Table 3 is the strong, though expected, negative association
between wives' time spent in employment and housework. Nonetheless two other
patterns also stand out. Wives spend more time on housework, the longer their
husbands' workweek, and in particular the more husbands earn. Surprisingly, there is
relatively little variation by age of the youngest child, though those with no children
under age 18 spend less time on housework than those with younger children. As noted,
direct childcare time is not reflected in these estimates and this would considerably
increase the domestic workload of those with preschool children. At the same time, it is
impressive that wives' housework time decreased markedly during the study period
even among those with children under age 3. Co-residence with parents reduces
housework time of both spouses in all three study years, but the degree of reduction
tends to be higher for husbands, thereby lowering husbands' share in couples'
housework time.
The 2009 follow-up allows us to see changes in housework time associated with
moving into and out of levels of wives' employment--not working, employed part-time,
or full-time--from 2000 to 2009, and the results are both substantial and as predicted.
Women who were at the same level of employment in 2000 and 2009 reported
essentially the same number of housework hours in both years, whereas housework
hours tended to decrease for those who moved up in their employment levels and
increase for those who moved down. Among those who were not employed in 2000, the
average weekly housework time increased by 5 hours if they were employed part-time
in 2009 and by 8 hours if they were employed full-time in 2009. Among those
employed part-time in 2000, the mean housework hours increased by 4 hours if they
stopped working by 2009, but decreased by 3 hours if they moved up to full-time
employment. Finally, those working full-time in 2000 had 4 hours less housework time
per week if they were employed part-time or not at all in 2009.
7. Marriage and gendered housework time
Young Japanese primarily live with their parents when they are unmarried, and the
transition to marriage has very different implications for men and women. Compared to
8 hours on housework per week among never-married women in 2009, the
corresponding hours are 27 among currently married women (see Table 4). The
difference in the distribution of hours is dramatic: in 2009 only 8% of never-married
women did more than 20 hours of housework per week, compared to 72% of married
women. Men report only 3­4 hours per week whether or not they are married. By
marrying, Japanese women change their position from a receiver of care within a
Demographic Research: Volume 27, Article 24
714 http://www.demographic-research.org
household to the primary provider of domestic tasks. Meanwhile, Japanese men remain
largely receivers of care with the main provider switching from their mothers to their
wives.

correlations between housework time and (a) reported marital happiness, and (b)
satisfaction with the division of household labor. We found that the more time the
husband spent on housework, the happier both spouses were with the marriage, with the
correlation stronger for wives' reports than for husbands' reports. Men and women
differed, however, on their satisfaction with the division of household labor relative to
the time the husband spent on housework: the more husbands did, the less satisfied they
were with the division of household labor, while wives were more satisfied with the
household-task allocation. While the relationship between men's participation in
housework and marital happiness is certainly reciprocal, it is consistent with a pattern
that when marriages are happy, men are more likely to comply with their wife's wishes
about housework, even if they do not want to. Hence, happier marriages may have
greater participation by husbands, but because these husbands are helping more at home,
they are less satisfied with the domestic-task allocation.
8. Conclusion
In summary, there have been increases in the proportion of Japanese wives working but
decreases in the hours they work. Husbands work very long hours--a mean of around
50 hours per week. Wives' employment decreases with their husbands' employment
hours and income, and increases with age of youngest child and co-residence with
parents. Between 1994 and 2009 wives have reduced their housework hours
substantially, and more husbands are doing at least some housework. Nonetheless,
husbands' average housework time increased by only about one hour per week. The
amount of time Japanese husbands spend on housework is still very small, and they are
clearly an outlier in comparison to their Western counterparts (Fuwa 2004). The time
wives spend doing housework varies markedly with their level of employment. Further,
when Japanese women marry, their housework hours increase dramatically. For men, in
contrast, marriage produces very little change in their housework time, with the main
provider of housework changing from their mothers to their wives. And, finally, there is
a positive correlation between husbands' housework time and reported marital
satisfaction of both wives and husbands.
