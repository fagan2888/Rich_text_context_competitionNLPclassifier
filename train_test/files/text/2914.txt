Abstract
German banks experienced a merger wave throughout the 1990s. However,
the success of bank mergers remains a continuous matter of debate. In this paper
we suggest a taxonomy as how to evaluate post-merger performance on the basis
of cost efficiency (CE). We categorise mergers a success that fulfill simultaneously
two criteria. First, merged institutes must exhibit CE levels above the average of
non-merging banks. Second, banks must exhibit CE changes between merger and
evaluation year above efficiency changes of non-merging banks. We employ this
taxonomy to characterise (successful) mergers in terms of various key-performance
and structural indicators and investigate the implications for three important
policy issues. Our main conclusions are twofold. First, approximately every
second merger is a success. Second, the margin of success is narrow, as the CE
differential between merging and non-merging banks is one percentage point.
Keywords: Banks mergers, regulation, distress, cost efficiency, Germany.

Non-technical summary
Since the early 1990s the number of banks declined substantially in most
financial systems. Ongoing consolidation is a global phenomenon. However, it
has been most remarkable in the largest banking market in Europe: Germany.
According to the most recent report on EU banking structures by the ECB the
number of credit institutions in Germany declined by approximately 35 percent
between 1997 and 2003, by far the largest reduction in the EU. Yet, Germany
still hosts most banks in Europe and exhibits the most fragmented market in this
comparison. This may explain why for example the ECB expects further bank
mergers especially among relatively small savings and cooperative banks.
An evaluation of the success of past merger activity is therefore crucial. In
this paper, we assess mergers from an efficiency point of view. We estimate a
stochastic cost frontier to measure the cost efficiency (CE) of banks. On the
basis of a comparison of both efficiency levels and changes of merging versus non-
merging banks we distinguish successful from non-successful mergers. Only those
banks that exhibit simultaneously higher levels and changes in efficiency after a
transaction are deemed a success.
Our main result is that approximately every second merger is a success ac-
cording to this taxonomy. However, the mean difference between merging and
non-merging banks is slim. On average, CE levels of the former are around a
mere percentage point higher compared to the according cohort of non-merging
banks in a given year. This difference remains fairly stable for a range of one to
nine years that elapsed after a deal.
We use this grouping to investigate if mergers that are subject to three deal-
specific characteristics are more or less often a success (or a failure). The first deal-
specific characteristic is the size of pre-merger CE differentials between targets
and acquirers to capture the potential for learning benefits due to the transfer of
managerial skills. Our results indicate that only in the short run larger differentials
lead more often to efficieny gains. In the long run, akin partners succeed more
frequently in terms of CE.
The second deal-specific characteristic refers to the usefulness of mergers as a
tool to resolve bank distress. Our results indicate that banks emerging from a deal
that involved a distressed target are approximately as often in the success group
as non-distressed mergers. However, those deals where the acquiring institute is
distressed exhibit less frequently CE levels and changes above the benchmark set
by non-merging banks.
The third characteristic refers to the regional proximity of merger partners.
Savings bank mergers among institutions from the same municipality are in the
short and medium run less frequently a success compared to cooperatives. Poten-
tially, the lower frequency of successful savings mergers may be due to the lack of
optimal partners that are geographically close by.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Seit 1990 ist die Anzahl von Banken weltweit massiv zurückgegangen. Ins-
besondere die Konsolidierung im größten Bankenmarkt der EU, Deutschland, ist
bemerkenswert. Gemäß dem aktuellen Report der EZB zur Struktur des eu-
ropäischen Bankwesens ist die Anzahl deutscher Kreditinstitute zwischen 1997
und 2003 um etwa 35 Prozent gesunken. Trotz dieser mit Abstand stärksten Ab-
nahme bleibt das deutsche Bankwesen fragmentiert und die Anzahl an Banken
ist nach wie vor die höchste in der EU. Dies mag erklären, weshalb zum Beispiel
die EZB auch für die nahe Zukunft weitere Bankfusionen, speziell im Sparkassen-
und Genossenschaftsbankensektor, erwartet.
Eine Bewertung bisheriger Bankfusionen ist daher von großer Bedeutung. In
dieser Studie bewerten wir Fusionen nach Effizienzgesichtspunkten. Wir schätzen
eine stochastic cost frontier, um die Kosteneffizienz (CE) einzelner Institute zu
messen. Wir identifizieren erfolgreiche Transaktionen, indem wir Effizienzniveaus
und -änderungen von fusionierenden und nicht fusionierenden Banken vergleichen.
Nur jene Banken, welche nach einer Fusion gleichzeitig höhere Effizienzniveaus
und -änderungen zeigen, werden als Erfolg gewertet.
Unser Hauptergebnis ist, dass gemäß dieser Einteilung etwa jede zweite Fu-
sion einen Erfolg darstellt. Der durchschnittliche Effizienzunterschied zwischen
fusionierenden und nicht fusionierenden Banken ist jedoch gering und beträgt
etwa einen Prozentpunkt. Diese Differenz ist stabil für Zeiträume zwischen ein
bis neun Jahren, nachdem eine Transaktion vollzogen wurde.
Wir untersuchen weiterhin, ob jene Bankfusionen besonders häufig erfolgreich
bzw. nicht erfolgreich sind, welche durch drei bestimmte Charakteristika gekenn-
zeichnet sind. Wir betrachten erstens die Effizienzunterschiede zwischen Banken
eine Periode vor der Fusion. Große Unterschiede deuten auf ein hohes Potenzial
zum Transfer von Managementfähigkeiten nach einer Verschmelzung hin. Die Er-
gebnisse zeigen, dass große Unterschiede nur unmittelbar nach einer Fusion häu-
figer zu höheren Effizienzgewinnen führen. Auf mittlere und längere Sicht sind
eher jene Fusionen erfolgreich, welche zwischen ähnlich effizienten Banken erfol-
gen.
Wir betrachten zweitens, wie häufig Fusionen mit problembehafteten Banken
ein Erfolg sind. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Fusionen, in welchen das über-
nommene Institut sich in einer problematischen Situation befand, in etwa genauso
häufig in der Erfolgsgruppe vertreten sind wie Fusionen zwischen Banken ohne
gravierende Problemanzeichen. Es zeigt sich auch, dass Transaktionen mit pro-
blembehafteten Banken als aufnehmendes Institut selten zu einer erfolgreichen
Transaktion führen.
Die dritte Eigenschaft betrifft die regionale Nähe der Partner einer Fusion.
Fusionen zwischen Sparkassen innerhalb einer politischen Gemeinde sind seltener
ein Erfolg als Genossenschaftsbankfusionen. Die geringere Häufigkeit von erfolg-
reichen Sparkassenfusionen deutet unter Umständen einen Mangel an geeigneten,
geografisch nah liegenden Partnern an.

Evaluating the German Bank Merger Wave1
1 Introduction
Time and again, practitioners and regulators claim that increased competition
in the financial industry triggered profound changes in Germany's banking land-
scape. The drastic and continuous decline of the number of competitors since
the early 1990s is one of the lighthouse cases put forward as an illustration of
this claim. In fact, the number of banks constituting the three pillars of German
banking declined from 4,177 to 2,160 due to mergers and acquisitions between
1991 and 2003.2
Research on the dynamics of US banking markets is fairly abundant, but
our knowledge of the effects of German bank mergers remains limited. This is
cumbersome because bankers, regulators and the public all have an interest to
evaluate the effects of bank mergers.
A clear understanding of post-merger performance can, for example, facilitate
decision making of bankers on the one hand, and successful future supervisory
work on the other. To our knowledge, this study is the first to analyse the con-
solidation effects of the merger wave among all German cooperative and savings
banks. In this paper we suggest a taxonomy to evaluate bank mergers. The ana-
lytical workhorse is cost efficiency (CE) as measured by stochastic frontier analy-
sis. We pursue three objectives. First, we want to identify successful mergers on
the basis of CE. Second, we want to characterise successful as opposed to unsuc-
cessful mergers. Third, we want to apply the taxonomy to evaluate the influence
of potential skill transfers between merger partners, the success of mergers as a
means of resolving distress and the impact of prevailing regulation on geographical
limitations for merger success.
We organise the paper as follows. In section 2 we employ data provided by
the Bundesbank to supply an extensive description of market dynamics in these
two important bank pillars. This descriptive analysis serves as the fundament to
section 3 where we formulate a set of questions to address three particularities in
German banking. Section 4 explains the methodology for measuring CE and how
we identify successful mergers. In section 5 we present results on characteristics
of merging and non-merging banks. We further investigate the effects of skill
transfer, distress and regulation on the success of mergers. We provide recom-
mendations with regard to previously raised issues on the basis of fresh empirical
evidence. Section 6 supplies some final thoughts.

2 The German Bank Merger Wave
Our starting point in this paper is a stylised fact - German banks merged. The lit-
erature on bank mergers suggest a variety of possible reasons for this observation.3
But as put forward by Amel et al. (2004), the majority of motives advocated are
not mutually exclusive and thus rather reflect attempts to rationalise as to why
banks merge instead of representing exclusive explanations.
This indeterminacy of merger motives notwithstanding, the causal chain of
events is according to many scholars surprisingly similar, see for example Berger
(2003). Decreased information asymmetries of investors, lower switching costs for
borrowers, non-bank intermediaries venturing into traditional banking activities
and more leeway for incumbent banks to expand operations both in terms of
geographic and product scope all lead to increasing competitive pressure.
To counter these pressures, banks engage in mergers in order to utilise re-
sources more efficiently. Likewise, a profound lack of efficient operations can lead
banks to face financial distress. To resolve distress, banks may exit the market
through mergers.4
Hence, the effects of mergers should ideally affect efficiency in a positive way.
Therefore, many studies on merger effects focus on a comparison of the productive
efficiency of banking firms. We follow this notion and provide in this section a
description of the major characteristics accompanying the German merger wave.
2.1 Competitive Pressure
We have at our disposal data on all savings and cooperative banks for the period
from 1993 until 2003. We focus on these two pillars for three reasons. First, they
account for more than a third of total assets managed in the German banking
system and represent more than 80 percent of all banks in terms of number.
Second, the vast majority of mergers occurred among these institutes. While
a number of studies focus on mergers among publicly listed banks, this study
provides to our knowledge the only evidence on the (lack of) success of mergers
for these banking sectors as a whole. Third, Hackethal (2004) points out that
savings and cooperative banks are vital to the backbone of Germany's economy,
namely the "Mittelstand". Therefore, we are particularly concerned about the
success of bank mergers in these banking groups.
The data were obtained from the Bundesbank. All banks operating in Ger-
many annually report balance sheet and profit and loss account data. To grasp
the dynamics of competitive pressure during the last decade, consider table 1.
Profitability as measured by return on equity (ROE) more than halved in
this period. If competition increases, prices are driven down to marginal cost. As
markets approach perfect competition, textbook economic theory predicts that no
additional rents above marginal cost can be realised. We cannot observe marginal
cost. But the development of ROE indicates in any case that comfortable profit
bolsters during the early 1990s no longer prevail among German banks.
3For example, the OECD (2000) lists technical change, globalisation and deregulation as
three major triggers for mergers in the financial industry.
4Koetter et al. (2005) find that banks with weak financial profiles are more likely to merge.

4) Hirschman-Herfindahl Index between 1 and 10,000 per county.
Note: ROE, CI and NIM of savings and cooperative banks in percent.
The fact that cost-income ratios (CI) stayed fairly constant in the course of
events signals to us that the deterioration of profitability cannot be explained by
poor bank management alone. In such a case, administrative expenses as a share
of operating revenue should have soared in lock-step. However, with the exception
of the period involving stock market crashes around the turn of the century, we
observe that mean CI ratios seem to have been kept in check on an ongoing basis.
At the same time, deteriorating net interest margins (NIM) could reflect how
spreads between lending and borrowing are competed away. Seemingly, ongoing
consolidation, as illustrated by the declining number of banks, did not result in
banks seeking monopoly rents. Individual cooperative and savings banks might
still be too small to exercise market power. The mean size of banks increased
for our sample from around C
= 300m to a still fairly small scale of operations of
C
= 820m. We interpret our findings as indication that despite increasing mean
size banks continued to face considerable competition. Consequently, excessive
market power is at first sight a minor concern.
Not a single bank exited the market due to outright failure during the ob-
servation period. The consolidation nonetheless left a profound imprint on Ger-
many's banking structure. Local market concentration increased by more than
25 percent.5 Measured by total assets under management per county and year
we record an increase in the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index from just below 3,000
to 4,110 points between 1993 and 2003.
In sum, simple key performance indicators (KPI) convey in line with Bikker
and Bos (2005) that competitive pressures increased among German banks during
the last decade despite increasing concentration. A massively reduced number of
institutes bears witness to a changing bank market structure. The brunt of these
changes is in fact borne by mergers. The massive reduction of the number of
banks demands an evaluation of the success of mergers and the implications for

market power, concentration and prices. We rather restrict ourselves to simply acknowledge that
market structure changed substantially in terms of markedly fewer banks managing increasingly
larger volumes of assets.

2.2 Consolidation
The Bundesbank collected data on 1,417 targets that were acquired during the
period from 1994 to 2002.6 We have information about both acquirer and target
at our disposal for each of these transactions.7 Table 2 provides data on the mean
size of acquiring, target and non-merging banks in the year prior to the merger.
We depict these measures by banking group. Additionally, we supply both the
total volume and the number of acquirer and targets.

3) Multiple acquirers only included once per year; serial acquirers included in each merger year.
In accordance with Lang and Welzel (1996), we observe that most mergers
occurred among cooperative banks. While the number of German savings banks
declined by approximately 20 percent from 654 banks in 1994 to 519 banks at year
end of 2003, the corresponding decline of cooperative banks is 45 percent, reflect-
ing a reduction in the number of banks from 2,651 to 1,480 in the same period.
Consequently, the merger process in the two sectors might differ. For example,
regulation and/or government ownership potentially shelters savings banks to a
larger extent from competition compared to cooperatives. We then would expect
market structure and profitability measures to exhibit these differences. We there-
fore investigate in the next subsection some simple performance and structural
indicators per sector in the year of a merger.
6The total number of targets is 1,465 in the reference period, representing a decline from
3,464 institutes in 1993 to 1,999 institutes in 2002. We had to discard 48 mergers due to missing
data on either the acquirer or the target. We lack information prior to 1994 and after 2002.
7The number of acquirers is below the number of targets due to, first, serial acquirers and,
second, multiple acquisitions in a given year by the same acquirer.

Because we focus in this paper on an evaluation of the (lack of) success of
bank mergers, we are less interested to add another, to put it in terms of Amel
et al. (2004), rationalisation to the literature as to why banks merged. We limit
ourselves to extend our set of KPI introduced in section 2.1 by three additional
indicators. In doing so we aim to assess the plausibility of three frequently raised
motives by simple characteristics per bank. Let us briefly discuss the three motives
mentioned before we turn to the ratios in the next section.
A first reason as to why banks might merge is to enhance productivity of
labour. An intuitive illustration of this motive relates to technical advances in
banking. For example, Valverde et al. (2004) provide evidence that the increased
use of automatic teller machines and electronic payment systems fostered the
reduction of (labour intensive) branch offices. It is conceivable that banks aim
to enhance the productivity of labour by means of mergers. As German labour
laws are restrictive, restructuring the branching network of two banks operating
with considerable overlap is easier compared to simply laying off employees and
substituting them with technology.
Secondly, time and again practitioners hypothesise that merging banks aim
to realise economies of scale.8 Table 2 illustrates the small size especially of co-
operative banks. Cost pressures due to squeezed interest margins and too small
operations to spread fixed costs fuel the (perceived) need to expand the asset base
of these banks. The popularity of this notion among practitioners is vividly illus-
trated by a quote from Wolfgang Arnold, vice president of the German Bankers
Association:
"[...] Ein alter ökonomischer Lehrsatz befasst sich mit den Economies
of Scale. Wenn man erforderliche Größenordnung nicht selbst erre-
ichen kann, schließt man sich zusammen und optimiert über die Volu-
mina kostenträchtige Abläufe. [...]"9
While we point out that the academic literature fails consistently, somewhat
stubbornly, to find evidence in favour of economies of scale, we devise below a
simple indicator variable to learn if successful mergers exhibit characteristics that
support this motive.10
For an illustration of a third popular motive, consider the number and volume
of deals depicted in table 2. The second peak of merger activity around the
turn of the century is associated with turmoil in security markets.11 Banks that
expanded their securities business during rallying stock markets may have fallen
victim to mergers after the stock market crashed. Struggling banks with relatively
8According to Amel et al. (2004) this is probably one of the most popular potential motives.
9Press conference held in Frankfurt am Main on September 18, 2002. Available at
http://www.bdb.de. The unofficial translation is: "[...] An established economic proposition
concerns economies of scale. If one cannot achieve the required size of operations individually,
one combines these operations to optimise cost-intensive workflows by means of higher quanti-
tities processed. [...]"
10Importantly, we do not claim here to conduct a formal investigation of the issue. An example
ofa European study that estimates economies of scale is Lang and Welzel (1996).
11After a period of rallying stock markets, the stock market index DAX tumbled from an
annual average of 6,164 points in 1999 to 3,967 points in 2002.

large non-interest income shares potentially turned prey to banks that aimed to
diversify income sources at comparably favourable conditions.12
As noted throughout we do not assume that any of these rationales is solely "re-
sponsible" for mergers to occur. However, if these frequently encountered merger
motives - productivity, scale and scope enhancement - indeed drive mergers, we
expect to observe that our simple descriptives reflect these goals and improve after
a merger. We turn next to these characteristics across merging and non-merging
banks to obtain the stylised facts on bank characteristics after a merger.
2.3 Characteristics
If we assume that increased competition is indeed a major driving force of mergers
and therefore changing market structures, we are interested in learning about the
immediate implications for bank's post-merger profitability and costs. In table
3, we depict mean KPI to compare merging and non-merging banks across bank
sectors in the year a deal occurred.13

Note: Excluding pre-merger observations of ultimately merging banks.
Profitability differed significantly for both banking groups between merging
and non-merging banks by 5 to 7 percentage points of ROE. Likewise, cost pres-
sure is higher for banks that just merged, as measured by higher CI ratios. How-
ever, comparably poor KPI may result from a recent transaction, for example,
due to the integration of a new sales force or from incurring additional advisor
fees during the transaction.
Local concentration, measured by HHI, is higher among those banks that
merged, especially for savings banks. Those banks that merged are thus operating
in local markets with at times markedly fewer competitors. This can imply market
power. But at the same time mean NIM do not differ a lot between merging and
non-merging banks. Furthermore, for savings banks mean NIM is not significantly
12This motive indicator variable relates to the literature that seeks to estimate economies of
scope. An example of studies along this strand is Lang and Welzel (1998).
13This is in contrast to table 2, where mean KPIs refer to pre-merger years.

different despite substantially higher concentration among merging savings banks.
Rent seeking therefore seems to be an issue of less importance in our sample.
But while we find only limited evidence for rent seeking, higher concentra-
tion may still imply that market discipline is lacking and therefore banks fail to
monitor costs carefully. Foregone cost savings imply unnecessary reductions of
producer surplus and are thus undesirable. This line of thought is supported by
higher CI ratios for merging banks of both sectors, when paired with higher mean
concentration.14
In section 2.2 we collected three potential motives as to why banks merge.
These are to enhance labour productivity, to reduce fixed costs relative to total
assets and to diversify income sources. While we abstain from a formal investiga-
tion of these motives due to reasons mentioned above and in Amel et al. (2004),
we devise three simple indicators to gain some insight.
To grasp the labour productivity of merging and non-merging banks, Prod,
we relate the number of full time equivalent employees (FTE) per bank to total
assets. While the difference in table 3 is small, we find that merging banks
employ significantly more FTE per million Euro of total assets than non-merging
banks. According to this rough measure, non-merging banks use labour more
productively.
To investigate if economies of scale are a plausible merger motive, we relate
banks' operating costs to total assets to approximate unit costs, UC. Our data
indicate that among small cooperative banks the difference between merging and
non-merging banks is significant but small. For each Euro of total assets coop-
erative banks incur roughly 6 Euro cent in costs. Somewhat lower unit costs of
savings banks are in line with larger mean sizes reported in table 2. But minuscule
differences between merging and non-merging banks indicate that scale economies
are not a primary reason to merge.15
A third potential motive is the notion that banks merge to diversify their
income sources. We test if fee income as a share of total revenue, INC, differs
significantly between merging and non-merging banks. While we reject the null
hypothesis of different mean fee income shares for savings banks, we find evidence
that merging cooperative banks exhibit an earnings structure significantly differ-
ent from non-merging banks. The relatively large difference suggests that tapping
alternative income sources could be a reason for (cooperative) bank mergers.
To sum, we find that merging and non-merging banks differ with respect to
profitability and cost management both in the savings and cooperative banking
sector. These KPI measures indicate that merging banks perform worse than
non-merging ones in the transaction year. Regarding interest margins, market
concentration, labour productivity, unit costs and income sources, we receive
mixed signals depending on the banking sector. Merging savings bank operate
in significantly higher concentrated local markets and suffer from lower labour
14Note that the high p-value for the difference in mean test for cooperative banks may be due
to outliers in the data. As we intend in this section to describe the stylized facts we included all
banks which submitted data to the Bundesbank and were thus in operation. When estimating
the efficient cost frontier we conducted robustness checks by excluding extreme observations.
Results remained qualitatively unaffected.
15While we are aware of the crudeness of our measure, this simple plausibility check is in line
with studies that consistently fail to identify scale economies gains due to mergers.

productivity; merging cooperative banks exhibit a higher share of fee income.
Regarding market concentration, differences between merging and non-merging
banks are either minuscule and/or insignificant.
In line with Koetter et al. (2005), the described characteristics indicate that
merging banks perform at best mediocre. But with regard to the evaluation of
the success of mergers, we argue that all of the discussed measures suffer from
two major limitations.
The first caveat refers to the development of KPI over time. For example, lower
labour productivity in the transaction year itself may merely reflect the rigidity
of German labour laws. Adjustments of the labour force are time-consuming as,
for example, numerous employees at savings banks are protected by civil servant
status. Hence, large scale labour force reduction is only possible by using natural
fluctuation rather than Anglo-Saxon style lay-off waves. Therefore, it is in our
view crucial to track the performance of merged institutes over some time.
The second caveat is that any of the above mentioned measures provide little
information about what the optimal KPI could have been for banks operating un-
der potentially markedly different circumstances. After all, the share of the differ-
ence between mean ROE for merging and non-merging banks that is attributable
to poor management of the bank versus deteriorating economic conditions or sheer
bad luck remains unclear. We simply cannot state by observing some increased
post merger ROE whether the firm performed optimally - a higher return after
the merger might still be far from what could have been attained.
An alternative strand in the literature therefore suggests benchmarking banks
according to their ability to convert inputs into outputs.16 We employ cost effi-
ciency (CE) to measure the success of mergers. This approach ranks firms relative
to an optimal industry cost function.
The appeal of this measure is that we evaluate mergers on the basis of simple
textbook microeconomic theory. We assume that banks operate on markets that
are appropriately described by perfect competition.17 We expect a cost minimis-
ing firm to produce its outputs by demanding required inputs subject to prevailing
input prices. We then estimate an optimal cost function under the assumption
that deviations from best practice are, first, due to random noise and, second, due
to inefficient allocation of inputs. Intuitively, no bank can incur systematically
higher costs compared to competitors. To avoid being driven out of the market
any bank has to demand inputs in optimal proportions to produce a given output
vector. We argue that this also holds for banks which potentially pursue alterna-
tive objectives - in the long run no firm can afford systematically higher costs for
identical production factors employed.18
We postpone a formal introduction of our empirical model as to measure cost
efficiency to section 4. Beforehand, we discuss three characteristics that may
foster or hamper successful mergers in German banking.
16See for example Vannder Vennet (1996, 2003), DeYoung (1997) and Peristiani (1997).
17For the validity of this assumption see also Bikker and Bos (2005).
18In contrast, it may very well be possible that German savings and cooperative banks may not
strictly maximise their revenues as to maximise profits. Therefore, ROE and other traditional
performance measures may fall short to assess the success of bank mergers. But even with these
philanthropic co-objectives it is plausible that while revenues may not be maximised any bank
has to optimise its costs when allocating resources to provide financial services.

3 Facilitators and Obstacles to M&A Success
The preceding subsection shows that we have to, first, distinguish between suc-
cessful and unsuccessful mergers. Second, we are interested in the development of
bank-specific characteristics as measured by the previously introduced KPI over
time. As opposed to these bank-specific characteristics, merger success might
crucially depend on characteristics related to both how the deal is conducted
and the environment in which it takes place. We refer to these as deal-specific
characteristics and we investigate the following three:19
1. Transfer of skills between merging banks
2. Mergers as distress resolution tool
3. Influence of regional demarcation
With the exception of the influence of regional demarcation on merger success,
we regard these deal characteristics as endogenous to merger management. That
is, we assume that regulation cannot be influenced by the management in charge
of conducting the merger. Rather, investigation of the relation between regional
demarcation and merger success intends to shed light on the costs and benefits
of this arrangement. In contrast, the former two characteristics are the result
of decisions made by management, i.e. if and how to transfer skills or to merge
with another bank in order to resolve distress. In fact, our merger data allows us
to classify mergers according to these three criteria and thus learn if deals with
particular characteristics are more or less frequently a success (or a failure).
Subsequently, we motivate each of the three either by means of evidence from
the literature or on the basis of merger data available. In addition to the devel-
opment of merging banks' KPI, these three deal characteristics will serve later on
as a guideline to structure the discussion of our results in section 5.
3.1 Transfer of Skills
Lang and Welzel (1998) investigate merger effects for a sample restricted to co-
operative banks in the state of Bavaria. They find that in 53% of all mergers the
acquirer is more cost efficient than the target. However, only 18% of all merged
banks with higher ex ante acquirer CE managed to exhibit above average effi-
ciency growth after the merger. In contrast, they find that 35% of all mergers
with positive ex ante CE differences yield below average CE growth after the
merger. They conclude that these acquirers failed to transfer their superior CE
skills to the target.
This finding reflects that the transfer of cost management skills matters a
lot to determine success but that it can be difficult to accomplish. If banks with
superior CE performance manage to lift the merged units' overall CE, mergers are
19Clearly, there is a virtually infinite number of additional factors that may matter, for ex-
ample board compositions or local macroeconomic environments. Our choice here is motivated
by the availability of data and the policy relevance of the deal characteristic from our point of
view.
9
a desirable because they improve the competitive position of a bank and thereby
strengthen the stability of the whole banking system.20
Whether a beneficial transfer of skill is successful depends on two major fac-
tors. First, the size of the ex ante differential. On the one hand, a larger differ-
ential can indicate that cost management skills of one of the partners are clearly
below those of the other partner. Then, potential for improvement is easily iden-
tified. Relatively large gains may be quickly realised by simple imitation. An
example is that one bank pursues excessive spending on real estate resulting in
excessive office capacities. Switching to facilities closer to market cost then en-
tails a quick win if switching costs are low enough. On the other hand, a large
differential can indicate that one partner suffers from substantial problems that
cannot be easily remedied. An example is a funding structure incurring too high
interest payments. If these are stipulated in contracts there is presumably little
a new management team can do in the short run.
The second factor refers to whether it is the target or the acquirer that exhibits
higher CE. Acquirers that are dominant in terms of CE may very well command
sufficient power to enforce their management procedures on the target. However,
we have no reason to expect ex ante that the acquirer is indeed superior. Because
of the respective government and member ownership structure of savings and co-
operative banks (see Altunbas et al. 2001), we know that ownership shares are not
freely traded. Consequently, majority stakes cannot be accumulated in a hostile
fashion. The absence of a full-fledged market for corporate control may imply
that objectives other than value maximisation are important for determining the
acquirer and target in a merger. If it is indeed to some extent a political process
that determines the role in a merger, it may turn out that a large but potentially
less efficient bank is the acquirer. Then, it can be less likely that best practise
from the target is wholeheartedly embraced by the new organisation.
Whether such scenarios prevail and whether we can observe particular com-
binations of pre-merger CE differentials to yield systematically more (or less)
successful mergers remains an empirical question that we address below. This
way, bankers, head organisations and regulators can evaluate pending mergers on
the basis of pre-merger CE differentials to promote beneficial combinations that
are likely to improve CE.
3.2 Mergers and Distress
As no single bank went into outright bankruptcy it is reasonable to expect that a
number of bank mergers served the purpose to remedy distress. Table 4 underpins
that around 100 mergers are identified as distressed transactions.
We follow Porath (2004) and Koetter et al. (2005) and retrieve data on dis-
tressed banks from the Bundesbank's database on default information. We focus
here only on those events that represent restructuring efforts by means of merg-
ers.21 As can be seen in table 4, distressed mergers are not limited to cases where
a bank becomes a target. In fact, it occurred equally often that distress resulted in
20How far such joint CE must be lifted depends on the definition of a successful merger. We
discuss that matter at length in the next subsection.
21Detailed definitions of distress can be found in Porath (2004) and Koetter et al. (2005).

the bank acquiring a non-distressed bank. Only in six cases, both parties involved
in the merger were classified as distressed by Bundesbank records.
In sum, our data permit identification of mergers that received regulatory
attention due to distress as opposed to transactions involving banks that are not
identified by Bundesbank records as distressed mergers. We want to examine if
mergers are a successful instrument to ensure financial stability and soundness.
To this end, we analyse below if distressed mergers are relatively more or less
frequently identified as a success.
3.3 Mergers and regional proximity
The process of merging involves additional important institutions next to the
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision ("Bun-
desanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin"). These are the respective
head organisations of the savings and cooperative bank sectors, DSGV and BVR,
respectively (Reifner and Evers 1998, Maselli 2000).
While supervision authorities adhere to principles of financial soundness and
stability, representatives of these head organisations guard what is known as the
principle of regional demarcation ("Regionalprinzip").22 This principle is de facto
enforced among both cooperative and savings banks. It stipulates that regional
banks of these sectors must not conduct operations beyond the borders of their
assigned region. The objective of this regulation is to ensure that rural and
economically weak areas are also supplied with financial services in Germany.
Consequently, many mergers among savings and cooperatives involve banks
which are geographically close to each other. Table 5 depicts the number of
mergers where both target and acquirer originate from the same region.
In 64 percent of the events, mergers among savings banks involve targets and
acquirers that originated from the same county ("Kreis").23 Approximately 15
percent of all mergers in this group concern banks from the same municipality
22Legal definitions of financial soundness and stability, to which both Bundesbank and BaFin
adhere, are outlined in a series of laws. The German Banking Act ("Kreditwesengesetz, KWG")
is the most important one and is complemented by a number of regulations.
23Equal to the sum of county and municipality mergers over total, i.e. (86+26)/176, as one
county is distinguished into multiple municipalities.

("Gemeinde").24 For cooperative banks regional proximity of merger partners is
even more evident. In almost 80 percent of all the cases, both parties are from
the same county. A quarter of all cooperative bank mergers involve banks from
the same municipality.
There are two main reasons why mergers in the same region can be superior.
First, it is possible that these transactions serve the purpose of reaching some
required minimum size to operate efficiently. If two banks serve the same com-
munity with considerable overlap in their customer base, joined operations can
help reduce unit costs if excess capacities, for example branches or employees,
are reduced. Second, mergers among banks from the same vicinity may be su-
perior because the acquirer is presumably familiar with local market conditions,
for example weaknesses and strengths of local corporate firms, local politics or
customer habits.
On the other hand, it is possible that the Regionalprinzip implies a lack of po-
tential partners in a given region. Then it is more likely that target and acquirer
may fail to complement each other, e.g. in terms of product range or funding
structure. Mergers of banks located fairly close to each other might merely reflect
restrictions imposed by regulation. Another reason why close regional proximity
can result in inferior post merger performance is a lack of regional (income) di-
versification. The merged institute's revenue basis will be further concentrated
within confined boundaries, thus exposing the bank to a larger degree to local
macroeconomic conditions.25
In this paper, we abstain from a full-fledged analysis of the costs and benefits of
regional demarcation. However, we investigate whether mergers between nearby
banks are more often a success or not.
24Ideally, we investigate the geographical distance between target(s) and acquirer given the
prevailing regional demarcation issued by the head organisations. Alas, this information is
not available and we have to resort to publicly available regional indicators of counties and
municipalities where banks are located. The number of counties with banks is 438 and the
according number of municipalities is 2,333.
25Note an important caveat. Regions assigned to banks are not publicly available. There-
fore, we have to resort here to available regional identifiers, namely counties and municipalities.
Hence, our approach to investigate the relation between regional proximity and successful merg-
ers should be understand as a crude approximation of the implications of the principle of regional
demarcation only.
12
4 Methodology
Our first objective is to measure cost efficiency in a consolidating bank landscape
taking mergers explicitly into account. As noted by Lang and Welzel (1999), this
requires in a panel setting to model merged banks as new entities. This allows
banks after a transaction to follow a new efficiency path over time. Therefore, we
outline first our efficiency model.
Next, we suggest a taxonomy to define successful mergers that takes into
account both efficiency development and the efficiency of non-merging banks.
4.1 Cost Efficiency
We estimate cost efficiency (CE) with stochastic frontier analysis.26 We use the
intermediation approach and assume that banks produce three outputs. These
are interbank and commercial loans, y1
and y2
, respectively, and securities, y3
.
To this end banks utilise three inputs, which are demanded subject to prevailing
prices, wi
, and the technology constraint, depicted by a transformation function
T(y, x, z). A bank employs fixed assets, x1
, labour, x2
, and borrowed funds, x3
. In
addition, we include equity capital, z, to account for alternative funding sources
and heterogeneous risk-preferences among banks. Our sample includes all savings
and cooperative banks operating in Germany between 1993 and 2003.27
To estimate an optimal cost frontier for this unbalanced panel, we follow
Greene (2005) and use a bank-specific fixed effects stochastic frontier model with
time-variant inefficiency. Non-random differences in size, sector and regional lo-
cation of banks are now captured by the bank-specific fixed effects. To account
explicitly for ongoing consolidation, we follow the approach suggested by Lang
and Welzel (1999). A merging bank is treated as a new bank. We allow a merged
bank to follow a different optimal cost path inasmuch as each bank involved in a
merger is treated with a separate fixed effect k
.
This approach is markedly different from, say, including a dummy variable for
mergers in the cost frontier specification. Such a model boils down to estimating
one identical intercept for all banks that merge, which might be different from the
cost functions intercept of non-merging banks. However, it is a strong assumption
that the cost intercept is identical for all merging banks. The reduced form of
optimal cost is specified using the translog functional and takes the following
form:28
26We focus on CE as cost pressure is more frequently cited as one of the major reasons in
German banking to merge. A natural extension is to examine profit efficiency (PE). Given the
limited scope of this paper this approach is postponed for further research.
27To account for technological change we also include a time trend and interaction terms.
28We impose homogeneity and symmetry restrictions as in Lang and Welzel (1996).

In any year t, a bank k can deviate from optimal cost due to random noise,
vkt
, or inefficient use of in- and outputs, ukt
. To distinguish these two effects,
we specify a composed total error, kt
. For a cost frontier inefficiency leads to
above frontier costs. Therefore, the total error is kt
= ukt
+ vkt
. The random
error term vkt
is assumed i.i.d. with vkt  N(0, 2
v
) and independent of the
explanatory variables. The inefficiency term is i.i.d. with ukt  N|(0, 2
u
)| and
independent of the vkt
. It is drawn from a non-negative distribution truncated at
zero. Greene (2005) further notes that the k
's are allowed to be correlated with
the cost function variables, ykt
, wkt
and zkt
. Any systematic deviations from the
frontier due to heterogeneity across banks are captured by the fixed effect.
Note that inefficiency can vary over time but, apart from the distributional
assumption, is not further specified to follow any particular trend over time. This
approach has the virtue that efficiency can, for example, deteriorate in the imme-
diate aftermath of a merger but is able to "recover" after some time has elapsed.
At the same time, the cost frontier and the associated development of inefficiency
is bank-specific, as it depends to some degree on the fixed effect.
To allow banks to enter a new efficiency path, we assign a new identifier to
each bank after a merger. To illustrate this approach consider figure 1.
We assume for the sake of expositional ease that all banks A through D ex-
hibit a positive, linear trend of efficiency over time.29 Subject to its fixed effect,
D
, bank D illustrates a bank that is not merging during the observation pe-
riod and exhibits continuously improving CE. Assume now that compared to the
non-merging bank D two relatively less efficient banks A and B merge. Let the
relatively more efficient bank A acquire the relatively less efficient, but faster im-
proving, bank B in period 5. Then, efficiency differentials discussed in section 3.1
can be measured as the CE differential one year prior to merging. To adequately
evaluate the CE effects of merging, Lang and Welzel (1999) stress the importance
to treat the merged banks as if it is a new entrant to the market. Following their
suggestion we therefore assign a new identifier to this merged institute, C. Esti-
mated optimal cost, and hence efficiency, for this "new" bank are then subject to
29We stress again that such a development is by no means pre-determined by our specification
of the frontier. It exclusively serves the purpose of graphical illustration.

a new separate fixed effect. Put differently, the location of the optimal frontier for
this new emerged bank C is different from that of bank A and bank B. Thereby,
we allow efficiency to develop over time on a different path compared to that of
the two banks prior to the merger.
We are interested not only in a comparison to non-merging banks but especially
to distinguish successful and unsuccessful mergers. Let us therefore turn to our
definition of successful mergers on the basis of cost efficiency.
4.2 Successful Mergers
Identification of successful mergers on the basis of the level of efficiency alone
might be misleading. Consider as an example a bank that merged in 1995. Assume
it exhibits CE of 80 percent in 1997 relative to an average CE of non-merging
banks of 75 percent. On this basis alone the merger may then be considered a
success. But if the bank exhibited cost efficiency of 85 percent in the year of the
merger, 1995, the decline by 5 percent is hardly an achievement.
We therefore compare mergers along two dimensions. The first dimension is
the acquirer's change in CE in year t relative to the year of the merger. The
second is the level of CE of the merged institute in year t after the merger.
The first dimension captures changes in CE. As many practitioners point out,
potential gains require some time until they materialise. Therefore, we report
efficiency changes for a range of time t from 1 until 9.30 To evaluate whether a
particular merger was successful, we use as a benchmark the average efficiency
change of those banks that never merged, i.e. mean CE of all banks like D in
30We have information about merger acivities between 1994 and 2002. Hence, the maximum
number of post-merger years available is nine years, namely from 1995 to 2003.
15
figure 1 in year t.31 Hence, a decline in efficiency need not necessarily imply a bad
merger. If a bank suffered, for example, from a five percent drop in CE but the
group of non-merging banks experienced a drop of ten percent, the merger helped
to offset the negative trend. For example, we compare the two-year CE change of
a bank that merged in 1995 in 1997 with the CE change of non-merging banks in
the same two years.
The second dimension is the level of CE of merging and non-merging banks.
For example, along this second dimension, we compare a bank that merged in
1995 two years after the merger relative to the level of mean CE of non-merging
banks in 1997.32 Consider as an example figure 2.
We define mergers in the north-eastern quadrant, group I, as a success. These
transactions yield, first, higher CE levels compared to non-merging banks in the
year examined and, second, enjoyed an increase in CE since the merger above the
mean CE change of non-merging banks during the same time period. Below, we
examine if these successful mergers also exhibit other favourable KPI, e.g. higher
profitability and lower CI ratios. Likewise, we examine if successful (as well as
unsuccessful) mergers exhibit a clear profile in terms of deal-specific characteristics
in terms of transferring skills, regional proximity of partners, distress and learning
effects.
The south-eastern quadrant, group II, is deemed unsuccessful. Merged banks
exhibit above non-merging average CE two years after the transaction. But the
change in CE is lower compared to the mean change of non-merging banks. Such
mergers are unsuccessful because, for the example of an increasing industry trend
in CE, the bank failed to match positive market developments. This could be the
case if the acquiring bank was already highly cost efficient prior to the merger
leading to high levels of CE in the merger year itself.33 A high level of CE could
have led to a too relaxed attitude towards rolling out superior cost management
skills at the target quickly. We expect to obtain an indication if banks with ex-
treme pre-merger differentials fall relatively more often into this (or other) merger
groups, reflecting either inability or sheer neglect of transferring knowledge.
31We refer henceforth to those banks that never merged as non-merging banks. Thereby, we
avoid to compare in a given year merging bank's performance to a benchmark that includes some
banks which may merge later on. In fact, a banks' CE one year prior to merger may already differ
markedly from CE of banks never merging and can thus constitute a poor benchmark sample.
By excluding bank-year observations of institutes that eventually merge we avoid furthermore
a potential upward bias in the benchmark if successful banks merge early. Including these
successful early movers in the merger wave would then constitute a too high benchmark for
those relatively poor performing banks that follow suit at later stages of the merger wave.
32Note that our formulation of a benchmark is quite conservative as it requires successful
mergers to outperform non-merging banks simultaneously along two dimensions. Alternative
and less rigorous benchmarks are conceivable. For example, Vander Vennet (2003) compares on
the one hand pre- and post-merger efficiency rankings within the group of merging banks and on
the other he compares these measures between merging banks and those of a peer group selected
on the basis of institutional form, country and size. Here, we prefer to explicitly allow the merger
event to enter the fixed effect of the frontier and thereby influence the relative benchmark more
directly. Regarding the alternative of a peer group comparison we acknowldege here that our
sample already is much more homogenous compared to a cross-country study. Given the large
number of mergers we argue that the choice of relevant peer groups would be hard to achieve
and is likely to result in arbitrary selection criteria.
33Note, however, that we do not consider here how efficient the bank was in the year of the
merger but compare it to the benchmark t years after the merger.

The south-western quadrant, group III, depicts the worst mergers. In the
above example, mergers conducted in 1995 resulted two years later in CE levels
below those of non-merging banks in 1997, i.e. 74.94 percent. Moreover, these
banks exhibit a change in CE below the average of non-merging banks, namely
0.04 percent. We expect to see that these banks do also perform poorly in terms
of traditional KPI as they exhibit in terms of CE neither high levels of cost
management skill nor above average improvements.
Finally, the north-western quadrant, group IV, depicts banks with below non-
merging banks' mean CE but with above average changes in CE. Consequently,
these transactions are not univocally a success. But they may have the largest
potential as promising changes in CE may indicate above average efficiency after
some more time. We are interested below if, for example, especially those mergers
are a success where one partner suffered from clear deficiencies as reflected by
distress. While turning around a distressed bank could imply below average levels
of CE for a while, focused restructuring efforts could show up in our taxonomy
as above average improvements of CE.
Before turning to an assessment of the German merger wave on the basis of
our results let us briefly point out a potential caveat. The two dimensions on
which our grouping is based, namely the level and change of CE, respectively, are
not entirely independent from each other. A bank that exhibits above average CE
changes after up to nine years after the merger is also more likely to end up with a
level of CE above the average CE of non-merging banks. However, we argue that
most alternative approaches that rely either on levels of CE or, for that matter,
other KPI do suffer from even more severe problems as these approaches neglect
the development of the chosen performance ratio entirely.

5 Results
We present first the efficiency effects of merging banks according to the taxonomy
described in section 4.2.34 Compared to the group of non-merging banks we define
as a success those transactions that yield both (i) higher levels of cost efficiency
after the merger and (ii) exhibit above average changes in efficiency. Based on
this categorisation we subsequently investigate the issues raised.
5.1 Identification of Successful Mergers
In table 6 we depict for each cohort of merger years the difference between mean
CE of merging versus non-merging banks. We do so for both the level of and the
change in CE.

Savings and cooperative banks.
On average, the post-transaction level of merging banks' CE is higher com-
pared to non-merging banks. In addition, the change in CE compared to the
respective year of the merger is also above the mean CE change among non-
merging banks. Except for those mergers occurring in 1996 and 1998, most level
and change differentials are positive and significantly different from zero. Thus,
mergers have on average been a success in Germany's cooperative and savings
bank sectors.
34We conserve on space and do not provide parameter estimates and general descriptive
statistics on efficiency. They are available upon request from the author.
18
However, this success is on average modest regarding the level of improve-
ments, namely around a mere percentage point. The change of CE is more
favourable after considerable time has elapsed, say between seven and eight years
after the merger. Then, efficiency changes compared to the year of merger are
slightly larger compared to quick wins just one or two years after the merger.
But even a two percent increase can hardly be called a splendid performance.
Interestingly, for those mergers that were executed around the time of booming
equity markets in Germany, 1998 and 1999, the change of CE has been below
the average of non-merging banks up to three years after the transaction. This
could indicate that managers did not focus on keeping production cost efficient.
In times when the temptations to realise quick gains in new business arenas may
have been paramount from a banker's point of view, careful cost management was
apparently of secondary interest.
Table 6 depicts mean efficiency differentials. To further assess how many merg-
ers were a success we turn our attention to the distribution of mergers according
to the quadrant taxonomy described in section 4.2.

Note: Multiple acquirers included only once; each bank treated separately

The number of banks in group I is throughout the years after merging at
around 50 percent. Thus, we conclude that in terms of CE every second sav-
ings and cooperative bank merger resulted in a successful merger. To avoid that
multiple acquirers, i.e. those that absorbed more than one bank in a given year,
are assigned too much weight in the categorisation of mergers, we included these
banks' post-merger performance only once in each year they conduct multiple
acquisitions.35
Another indication provided by table 7 refers to the declining share of group
II mergers and the increasing share of group III mergers over time. A possible
explanation is that banks suffering from below non-merging banks' CE changes
ultimately also fall below the mean level of non-merging banks' CE ratios. Then,
these banks transit into the total loser group if they continuously experience below
average CE changes. However, the observation of switching shares of group II and
III, respectively, can only be regarded as an indication for the aforementioned
35We did the same for the calculation of efficiency differentials in table 6.
19
interpretation. This is because in table 7 it is also possible that the share of a
group stays fairly constant, such as for group IV, but the composition of individual
institutes continuously changes from year to year. To draw stronger inference we
would have to construct transition matrices and seek to estimate the probability
of transition given a whole range of bank-specific and environmental variables.36
While we argue that efficiency is particularly suited to evaluate the success of
mergers in the course of time, we acknowledge the inherent interest of practitioners
and regulators in alternative KPI to assess the (lack of) virtues of bank mergers.
We therefore turn to the development of KPI introduced in table 3 for each of
our merger groups.
5.2 Characteristics of Mergers across Groups
In table 8 we show the KPI ratios introduced in section 2.3 in addition to mean
CE over time and banking groups. Overall, KPI after a merger bear markedly
different information between savings and cooperative banks. In addition, most
differences between traditional KPI across groups are not significant in the long
run. Thus, they are by and large uninformative when categorising mergers on the
basis of CE six years after the merger. This indicates that after approximately
six years other factors than a merger determine these indicators. We therefore
concentrate in table 8 on the medium and short run.
Consider savings banks first. We find that profitability is highest for merg-
ers exhibiting above benchmark CE changes but below benchmark CE levels, i.e.
group IV mergers. At the same time both net interest margins and concentration
are highest for this group, too. Consequently, high profitability may be due to
market power. We consider such a merger not a success and conclude that market
power concerns are appropriate for savings banks that exhibit above benchmark
CE changes. Our taxonomy of success on the basis of CE seems to avoid identifi-
cation of such mergers as desirable. With respect to potential motives of merging
we find little support that either scope or scale economies are realised in savings
bank mergers. The share of fee to interest income and unit costs are not the
most favourable ones for our success group I. However, our productivity proxy
indicate that successful mergers are those with high labour productivity. Conse-
quently, savings bank mergers in Germany might indeed be a vehicle to reduce the
work force under comparably rigid labour laws. This result is akin to findings of
Lang and Welzel (1999) who report that only those mergers yield above average
efficiency growth which are accompanied by closure of branches.
Consider cooperative banks next. Profitability is high for group I but also for
group IV mergers. While the CI ratio is univocally the lowest for our identifica-
tion of successful mergers, this result implies that CE and profitability measures
contain different information. In contrast to savings banks, we find that neither
margins nor concentration is particularly high for group IV mergers. In fact,
both measures are hardly ever significantly different across merger groups. We
conclude that market power concerns are of minor importance for cooperative
36In fact, it is an interesting question in its own right which banks transit over time from one
group to another for what reason. An example of an explicit account of the transition dynamics
associated with bank consolidation can be found in Robertson (2001). Such an approach is
beyond the scope of this paper and subject to future research.

bank mergers. With regard to potential merger reasons we find as for savings
banks that productivity is most favourable for successful mergers. Thus, cooper-
atives may have used mergers as well to improve the productivity of their labour
force. In addition, unit costs are the lowest for successful mergers. This mirrors
the frequently raised objective of cooperative banks to increase the size of their
operations to realise economies of scale. Note also that both ratios are the only
significant ones in the long run. In contrast, income diversification is an unlikely
candidate for a merger motive as differences across groups are insignificant in all
periods.
We investigate next if the three characteristics raised at the beginning of sec-
tion 3 did facilitate or obstruct mergers to become a success.
5.3 Transfer of Skill
The first deal-specific characteristic in section 3.1 inquires if especially those merg-
ers are successful that involve partners with large CE differentials before a merger.
We create nine equally sized groups of CE differentials in table 9. We depict the
mean difference in CE levels between the acquirer and the target one year prior to
the merger, CEA

37For multiple acquirers we calculated the differential between the acquirer's CE level relative
to the average CE level of all targets weigthed by the respective target's total assets.
21
We then compare the relative frequencies of each merger group I through IV for
each of these nine CE differential groups to the population representation.

depicts mean CE of acquirer less CE of target one year prior to merger; multiple acquirers
included only once; each bank treated separately after merger. Savings and cooperative banks.
We draw three major conclusions. First, on average mergers involved pairs
where the acquirer is slightly more efficient prior to the merger, namely by about
one percentage point of CE. Given the tiny difference we concede that only little
room prevailed as to "import" superior managerial skills from either party into
the merged institute. Put differently, the desire to transfer skill or to replace less
able incumbent managers appears to be of lesser importance for most mergers of
cooperative and savings banks.
Second, large differentials of either kind, i.e. groups 1 and 9 in table 9, are in
the short run more frequently successful compared to those mergers that involve
banks with small CE differentials. Interestingly, those mergers where the target is
the dominant partner are identified considerably more often a success compared to
those where the acquirer dominates the target by a similarly large CE differential.
This result suggests that it is not per se important as to which of the partners
involved is dominant. We conclude that in the short run large differentials in
general spur realisation of "quick wins" as both minimum and maximum CE
differential groups 1 and 9 contain more often successful mergers.
Third, we find that the medium- and long-term effects differ markedly from
those of the short-run. On the one hand, mergers which involve acquirers with
CE levels on average ten percentage points higher than those of the target are less
frequently identified as a success. On the other hand, those transactions where
the target is around seven percentage points more cost efficient than the acquirer
are also in the medium-run more often a success. However, for this group the
benefits from transferring cost management skills wear off at the latest six years
after the merger according to our results. Moreover, in the medium- and long-term
those groups containing mergers with differentials close to zero, i.e. groups 4 to
6, contain successful mergers more frequently than any of the extreme differential
merger groups.
22
In sum, we conclude that large pre-merger CE differentials yield more fre-
quently successful mergers in the immediate aftermath of the transaction. But
these short-term improvements in CE, which can be due to a transfer of skill,
wear off already in the medium run. Three or more years after a transaction,
mergers involving banks with pre-merger CE differentials around zero yield more
often successful transactions.
5.4 Distressed Mergers
We next assess if distressed mergers are represented more than proportionately
in one of our merger categories. To this end we examine the short-, medium- and
long-term categorisation of (distressed) mergers in table 10. We compare group
representations of mergers without regulatory attention versus those where either
the target, the acquirer or both institutes are distressed.

Total N 189 2 7 2 200
Note: Each bank treated separately after merger; including multiple
acquirers once. Savings and cooperative banks.
Approximately seven percent of all transactions are distressed. We discuss
three major conclusions with respect to the success of distressed mergers. First,
the distribution of distressed mergers roughly mimics the one for non-distressed
transactions. In line with Koetter et al. (2005), this indicates that a number of
non-distressed mergers may be rather similar to those that received regulatory
attention. With respect to the group of mergers where both acquirer and target
received regulatory attention we note that robust inference seems inappropriate
due to the very low sample size. We therefore disregard this group here.
Second, mergers where the target is distressed are more often a success than
transactions where the acquirer is distressed. This result is robust over time.
Overall, the results clearly indicate that rendering a distressed bank the acquirer
in a problem merger is not beneficial from a CE perspective.
23
Third, we note that according to table 4, the majority of distressed mergers
occurred after 1997. Thus, our comparison of distressed and non-distressed merg-
ers six years after the transaction suffers from a lack of observations because the
last year of available data is 2003. We thus caution to draw inferences based on
these results alone. However, one interesting outcome is that out of the eleven
mergers that are still in existence six years after the transaction, the majority of
seven are transactions where the acquirer was initially distressed. Moreover, these
mergers are identified relatively often in group III. We tentatively interpret this as
a further indication that mergers with distressed acquirers are not recommended.
In sum we conclude that mergers can be a successful tool to alleviate distress
in the medium run. However, short-run gains are unlikely to materialise and wear
off in the long run. It is more favourable to render distressed banks the target
rather than the acquirer from an efficiency point of view.
5.5 Regional Proximity
We turn next to the question if regional proximity results in relatively more suc-
cessful mergers. In table 11 we compare the distribution of transactions across
groups representing three different degrees of regional proximity. First, we depict
mergers where partners are from the lowest level of regional demarcation avail-
able, namely municipalities. Second, we depict mergers where both the acquirer
and the target are from the same county. In the third pair of columns we show
those mergers where partners are from different regions as a reference group. As
previously, we analyse the short, medium and long run. We focus in our discussion
on two major conclusions.
First, merging savings banks that are located closest to each other are rela-
tively infrequently identified as successful mergers in the short and medium run.
The frequency of group I mergers ranges between 35 and 38 percent, respectively.
This is considerably less often compared to banks located further apart from each
other. Our results imply that regional proximity hampers merger success for this
banking group from a CE point of view. Note, however, that we cannot observe
whether these merger partners voluntarily decide to join or if they were forced to
join forces with "available" banks within their region.
Second, this result does not hold for cooperative bank mergers. In the short
run the representation of county and municipality mergers in group I is just
slightly below that for non-regional mergers in table 11. In fact, in the medium
and long run regionally close partners accomplish merger success more frequently
compared to those outside the region. The closer the partners in a cooperative
merger are, the higher are the chances to outperform non-merging banks in terms
of CE level and change even up to six years after the merger. This result is in line
with Lang and Welzel (1999), who note that successful cooperative bank mergers
in Bavaria are those that, first, involve partners with some overlap in their branch
networks and, second, reduce these redundancies by closing branches in order to
enhance efficiency. In the same vein, Hackethal (2004) show that the number of
cooperatives is despite ongoing consolidation still the highest in Germany, while
the size of their operations continues to be small. Our results here indicate that
cooperative bank mergers might thus have eliminated some of the excess coverage
in regions where fewer banks can provide customers more efficiently with banking

services. While we note that we have no information on branching overlap and
(lack of) branch closure, the results indicate to us that mergers of regionally close
cooperative banks are slightly different from savings bank mergers. More than
for the latter, proximity may rather reflect the elimination of too dense banking
(and branching) networks.
In sum, we find that regional proximity has different effects on mergers among
savings and cooperative banks, respectively. With the exception of county mergers
in the long run, savings banks are less frequently represented in group I compared
to cooperative banks. In contrast, regional proximity among cooperative banks
implies higher chances of a successful merger.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we suggest a taxonomy as how to evaluate the merger wave of
German savings and cooperative banks. We employ cost efficiency (CE) estimates
obtained with stochastic frontier analysis to benchmark banks on the basis of their
ability to efficiently convert inputs into outputs.
We define successful mergers as those which, first, yield CE levels that are
above mean CE of non-merging banks and, second, exhibit larger changes between
the evaluation and merger years as compared to the respective cohort of non-
merging banks in the same period.
Our results indicate that approximately every second merger is a success ac-
cording to our taxonomy. On average, cooperative bank mergers are more often
a success than savings bank mergers. Importantly, the margin of success as in-
dicated by mean CE level differences between merging and non-merging banks is
very small - on the order of one to two percentage points only.
Successful mergers exhibit higher profitability than transactions resulting in
25
below benchmark changes of CE, i.e. groups II and III. However, we find for
both banking groups that mergers in group IV, i.e. those that exhibit the highest
change in CE but below benchmark CE levels, also exhibit high profitability. For
savings banks, we find that both concentration and net interest margins are high-
est for group IV, too. We interpret these findings as indication that savings bank
transactions might fail to yield CE improvements due to the absence of market
discipline. In contrast, we find for cooperative banks that mean concentration and
net interest margins remain similar across groups. Consequently, market power
concerns do not seem to be an issue for cooperative bank mergers.
Investigation of three particularities of the German bank merger wave lead us
to the following core conclusions. First, the potential for transferring skills from
acquirers and targets is low as mean pre-merger CE differentials are minuscule.
Those few transactions with high CE differentials do not result in sustained CE
gains. Instead, we find that successful mergers exhibit no mean CE differentials.
Second, bank mergers where the acquirer is distressed are less often a success.
In contrast, mergers involving distressed targets lead in the short and medium
run relatively more often to successful mergers. Therefore, mergers where the less
efficient institute is the target are preferable.
Third, regional proximity of merger partners has on balance detrimental CE
effects for savings banks but positive CE effects for cooperative banks. Mergers
of cooperative banks from the same municipality are in the medium and long run
more often successful. In contrast, savings bank mergers involving partners from
the same municipality are rarely a success and more often an outright failure.
Finally, an additional route for further research is to assess bank merger success
on the basis of relative profit efficiency (PE). Because only few banks manage to
be efficient in both dimensions, we hypothesise that a simultaneous classification
based on PE and CE yields even fewer successful bank mergers.
