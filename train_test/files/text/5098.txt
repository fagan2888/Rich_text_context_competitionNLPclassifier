Offspring Protection: When the Sex
Difference in Physical Aggression
May Disappear
Eric T. Steiner1
Abstract
Parental aggression, that is, offspring protection aggression, can be viewed as a type of parental investment. Most mammalian
males do not exhibit parental investment and therefore exhibit little, if any, parental aggression. Men demonstrate parental
investment, and are typically more physically aggressive than women, but parental physical aggression in humans has been largely
unexplored. The current study examined potential sex differences in estimates of parental physical aggression involving hypo-
thetical situations, while controlling for general physical aggression. A self-report measure was administered to 217 students from
a western U.S. university (55 male nonparents, 50 female nonparents, 54 fathers, and 58 mothers). Male nonparents reported
higher parental physical aggression than female nonparents, but there was no difference between mothers and fathers. The results
are interpreted in light of ancestral effects of sexual selection and proximal effects of sex differences in testosterone, risk taking,
and fear aversion.

The literature on human parental aggression often refers to
aggression by a parent that harms offspring (e.g., Voisin, Hot-
ton, & Schneider, 2014). Conversely, the literature on nonhu-
man parental aggression often refers to aggression by a parent
that protects offspring, (e.g., Trainor, Finy, & Nelson, 2008).
The present study examined the latter form of aggression, that
is, offspring protection aggression, but with respect to humans.
The present study also used a common definition of aggression:
the intention to cause harm to another individual (Archer,
2009). Parental aggression can be directed toward another
human, that is, a spouse, stranger, adolescent, and so on, or a
nonhuman animal such as a dog that is threatening the parent's
child. Thus, theoretically humans can display parental aggres-
sion toward conspecifics and nonconspecifics, as is observed
with nonhuman animals (Svare, 1981).
Parental aggression in humans is relatively unexplored. As
such, a brief background on parental aggression among nonhu-
man animals is provided and then several human sex differ-
ences are discussed as they may pertain to human parental
aggression. Parental aggression is perhaps best understood as
a form of parental investment. The latter is defined as `` . . . any
investment in an individual offspring that increases the off-
spring's chance of surviving (and hence reproductive success)
at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring''
(Trivers, 1972, p. 139). In other words, parental investment is
any biological or behavioral expenditure by a parent that pro-
motes the welfare of a child and ultimately that child's own
reproductive success. Examples of parental investment include
everything from gestation to ensuring that one's child wears a
seatbelt in a car to parental aggression. Parental aggression can
be carried out by males (paternal aggression) or females
(maternal aggression).
A few examples that portray the range of species that engage
in maternal aggression include the red swamp crayfish (Pro-
cambarus clarkii; Figler, Twum, Finkelstein, & Peeke, 1995),

lizards such as the White's skink (Egernia whitii; Sinn, While,
& Wapstra, 2008), the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angu-
stirostris; Ribic, 1988), birds such as the dark-eyed junco
(Junco hyemalis; Cain, Rich, Ainsworth, & Ketterson, 2011),
the house mouse (Mus musculus; Maestripieri & Alleva,
1990), and the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta; Maestripieri,
Lindell, Ayala, Gold, & Higley, 2005). This range demon-
strates that maternal aggression is a well-preserved phenom-
enon across numerous taxa. Furthermore, the preservation of
maternal aggression as an adaption in various species serves to
hinder infanticide and predation, which are two principle
threats to offspring (Archer, 1988). In some species, such as
the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), infanticide has been led by
males (e.g., Watts & Mitani, 2000) as well as females (e.g.,
Townsend, Slocombe, Thompson, & Zuberbu
¨hler, 2007). For
detailed discussions on the biology and behavior of maternal
aggression, the reader is guided to more comprehensive sources
(e.g., Archer, 1988; Gammie & Lonstein, 2006; Svare, 1981).
Here it is added that humans are among the species that engage
in maternal aggression, and this topic is receiving increased
attention in the literature (e.g., Hahn-Holbrook, Holt-Lunstad,
Holbrook, Coyne, & Lawson, 2011).
If parental aggression is viewed as a form of parental invest-
ment, and given that males in over 95% of mammalian species
provide little or no parental investment (Clutton-Brock, 1989,
Clutton-Brock & Scott, 1991), then it may not be surprising
that paternal aggression is less common than maternal aggres-
sion. But though the former is less common, it is still a widely
observed phenomenon in the animal kingdom. Specific exam-
ples include a species of fish such as the smallmouth bass
(Micropterus dolomieu; Hanson, O'Connor, Van Der Kraak,
& Cooke, 2009), the dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli;
Reburn & Wynne-Edwards, 1999), the Canada goose (Branta
canadensis; Sedinger & Raveling, 1990), and the wild baboon
(Papio cynocephalus; Nguyen, Van Horn, Alberts, & Altmann,
2009). Interestingly, our closest ancestors, chimpanzees and
bonobos (Pan paniscus), do not demonstrate paternal invest-
ment (Geary, 2000), and therefore presumably no paternal
aggression. Humans are among the exceptions in mammals
with a significant and geographically widespread history of
paternal investment (Geary, 2000; Gray & Anderson, 2010).
Sex differences within a species, such as parental invest-
ment, are often explained by sexual selection: the process by
which sex-specific heritable traits get passed on to future gen-
erations, mostly by intrasexual competition and intersexual
choice (Darwin, 1871). Sex differences are explained in a
related manner by the idea that the reproductive success of
males is often limited by access to mates whereas reproductive
success of females is often limited by access to resources such
as food (Bateman, 1948), and these sex-different challenges
lead to sex-different adaptations. One explanation for what
drives sexual selection is the difference in minimum parental
investment between males and females (Trivers, 1972). That is,
the sex (usually the female) that is obligated to higher mini-
mum parental investment increased reproductive success by
being selective in choosing a mate, that is, demonstrating
intersexual choice, and this in turn drove intrasexual competi-
tion in the other sex (usually the male; Trivers, 1972). In terms
of parental aggression, the higher minimum parental invest-
ment by women, for example, in gestation and lactation, moti-
vates behavior to protect that investment, and an example of
such a behavior is maternal aggression. Considerable data have
supported the theory of sexual selection (Andersson, 1994;
Geary, 2010) and that sex differences are often linked with one
another, for example, the sex difference in testosterone is
linked with the sex difference in aggression (Archer, 2006).
Therefore, understanding potential sex differences in parental
aggression may be aided by examining sex differences in other
forms of aggression.
Among nonhuman animals, parental aggression tends to be
physical and direct, and therefore likely has relevance to
humans. Physical aggression and direct aggression are not
mutually exclusive constructs, but they are also not the same.
For instance, punching someone is direct, physical aggression.
Covertly pouring hot sauce on food believed to be eaten by
someone who is allergic to hot sauce is an example of indirect,
physical aggression. A meta-analysis of gender differences in
aggression in real-world settings revealed that men are on aver-
age more physically aggressive than women (Archer, 2004).
Also, meta-analyses showed that men are more physically
aggressive than women in various lab settings (Bettencourt &
Kernahan, 1997; Bettencourt & Miller, 1996). Furthermore,
men engage in more direct aggression than women (Campbell,
2006), and a meta-analysis of childhood and adolescent aggres-
sion reveals that this gender difference exists long before adult-
hood (Card, Stucky, Sawalani, & Little, 2008).
At a proximate level, many sex differences can be linked to
testosterone. Men's higher testosterone has been linked with
physical aggression (e.g., Archer, 2006), risk taking (e.g.,
Mehta, Welker, Zilioli, & Carr´
e, 2015), and reduced fear
response (e.g., Hermans, Putman, Baas, Koppeschaar, & van
Honk, 2006). Men are more physically aggressive as noted
earlier and also engage in more risky behavior (Byrnes, Miller,
& Schafer, 1999), and there is evidence that men's lower fear
aversion largely accounts for the sex difference in direct
aggression (Campbell, 2006). Moreover, a parent's intent to
cause harm to someone who is threatening the parent's child
involves some measure of risk taking and, possibly, temporar-
ily lowered fear aversion.
To be sure, parental protection often comes in nonphysical
and nonaggressive forms. As examples, a parent can supervise
his or her child swimming, monitor the child's access to busy
streets, restrict the child's use of dangerous objects or toys that
could be swallowed, and so on. Indeed, the National Center for
Health Statistics (2015) reported that the top three causes of
death among children 1­4 years of age in the United States in
2013 were drowning (393 deaths), motor vehicle accidents
(327 deaths), and suffocation (161 deaths). However, some
threats to children may very well elicit a physically aggressive
protective response by a parent. One example is if a parent
witnesses the kidnapping of his or her child by the other parent.
The U.S. Department of Justice (2010) reported that in 2010
2 Evolutionary Psychology
there were over 200,000 cases of parental kidnapping
worldwide.
To reiterate, maternal/paternal aggression is a type of
maternal/paternal investment. Humans demonstrate both
maternal and paternal investment. Women demonstrate
higher parental investment both at the minimum biological
level (e.g., gestation and lactation) and in terms of perform-
ing child care (Coltrane, 2000; Hook, 2010). Men exhibit
lower levels of fear (Brebner, 2003; Campbell, 2013) and
higher levels of testosterone, risky behavior, and general
physical aggression. In addition, men's higher physical
aggression can be used for a variety of survival or repro-
ductive ends (Buss, 2009), such as offspring protection.
That said, little is known about potential sex differences
in parental physical aggression and whether precursors to
such sex differences exist among nonparents. The current
study tested two hypotheses: (1) Male nonparents who are
asked to imagine having a child, and that child being threat-
ened, will report higher parental physical aggression than
female nonparents. (2) Fathers who are asked to imagine
that their child is being threatened will report higher par-
ental physical aggression than mothers.
Method
Participants
There were 109 females and 108 males for a total of 217 indi-
viduals who participated in the study. Ages ranged from 18 to
63 (M ¼ 30.42, SD ¼ 8.22). Ethnic breakdown was as follows:
96 participants (44%) were White/Caucasian, 50 (23%) were
Hispanic/Hispanic American, 26 (12%) were Black/African
American, 20 (9%) were Asian/Asian American, 14 (6%) were
mixed ethnicity, 7 (3%) were undisclosed, 2 (1%) were Native
American, and 2 (1%) were Pacific Islander. Highest level of
education completed was as follows: 84 high school, 59 some
college, 61 associate's or undergraduate degree, 10 graduate
degree, and 3 undisclosed.
Measures
The study included a survey with five demographic items for
age, gender, ethnicity, highest level of education completed,
and parental status. The latter item provided participants with
the option to select one or more of the following: childless,
biological parent, stepparent, and other.
The remaining items measured aggression using a Likert-
type scale. The first 9 items were obtained from a validated
measure of (general) physical aggression (Buss & Perry, 1992).
The authors reported a Cronbach's a (internal consistency) of
.85 for these 9 items. Item 7 was reversed scored. The remain-
ing 3 items were developed to measure estimates of parental
physical aggression involving hypothetical situations of an
increasing level of threat to a parent's child from verbal to
physical to potentially lethal. The 12 aggression items are
located in the Appendix.
Procedure
All procedures were approved by the institutional review board
where this study was conducted, and informed consent was
obtained before data collection commenced. Participants were
recruited from various undergraduate psychology classes from
a university located in the western United States.
The few participants who were neither childless nor biolo-
gical parents (i.e., parents of stepchildren, adopted children,
foster children, etc.) were excluded from analyses to be able
make a clear a distinction between ``nonparent'' and ``parent.''
For instance, if a childless man who recently entered a new
relationship and considered himself to be a stepparent to his
partner's child, this individual may have reduced group differ-
ences in the current study had he been included.
Statistical Analysis
An independent-samples t-test was conducted to determine if
parents reported higher parental physical aggression scores
than did nonparents. Higher scores among parents were
expected, given that they responded to hypothetical scenarios
involving their actual children whereas nonparents responded
to the same scenarios involving hypothetical children.
Subsequent analyses for nonparents and parents were kept
separate because instructions for the parental physical aggres-
sion items were slightly different for these two groups. That
is, nonparents were asked to imagine having a child, and that
child being threatened, whereas parents were asked to imag-
ine their actual child being threatened. This point is worth
elaboration. For a fair comparison between a nonparent and a
parent, both would have to be asked the same questions, that
is, both asked to imagine a hypothetical child of theirs being
threatened. And in such a scenario, parents would have to be
additionally asked to not picture their actual child being
threatened. Hence, two 1-way analyses of covariance
(ANCOVAs) were used to examine differences in parental
physical aggression while controlling for general physical
aggression between male nonparents (n ¼ 55) and female
nonparents (n ¼ 50), and between fathers (n ¼ 54) and
mothers (n ¼ 58).
Results
Analysis of internal consistency for Items 1­9 (general physi-
cal aggression) revealed a Cronbach's a of .82. For Items 10­
12 (parental physical aggression), Cronbach's a was .69, and
was maximized by not removing any of the 3 items. Values
over .70 are generally considered satisfactory (Nunnally,
1978). However, values over .60 may be acceptable for new
scales (Nunnally, 1978).
The data for general physical aggression and parental phys-
ical aggression were not normally distributed as shown by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, ps < .05. ANCOVAs were still
used because they are robust to violation of this assumption and
because of the relatively large sample in the study.

Furthermore, skewness and kurtosis values for both types of
aggression were between À1 and þ1.
There was a significant difference in general physical
aggression between men and women, F(1, 215) ¼ 27.90,
p < .001, Cohen's d ¼ .71. Men's scores (M ¼ 23.54, SD ¼
7.18) were higher than women's scores (M ¼ 18.67, SD ¼
6.39). These results are similar to those reported at the time
the scale was developed (Buss & Perry, 1992), and there-
fore suggest a comparable sample of participants in the
current study. General physical aggression was positively
correlated with parental physical aggression, r(215) ¼ .38,
p < .001, and therefore was included as a covariate in the
ANCOVAs. Age was not correlated with either general or
parental physical aggression, ps > .05. Descriptive statistics
for general and parental physical aggression are presented
in Table 1.
The independent-samples t-test revealed that parents
reported significantly higher parental physical aggression
scores (M ¼ 14.42, SD ¼ 3.65) than did nonparents (M ¼
12.99, SD ¼ 3.25); t(215) ¼ 3.04, p ¼ .003.
Regarding nonparents, Levene's test of equality of error
variances revealed that the variance for parental physical
aggression was homogenous, F(1, 103) ¼ .841, p ¼ .361. Gen-
eral physical aggression was a significant covariate for parental
physical aggression, F(1, 102) ¼ 28.28, p < .001. Male non-
parents reported higher parental physical aggression than
female nonparents, and this difference was statistically signif-
icant even while controlling for general physical aggression,
F(1, 102) ¼ 5.08, p ¼ .026, Cohen's d ¼ .46. Estimated mar-
ginal means of parental physical aggression for nonparents are
presented in Figure 1. As expected, an ANOVA (i.e., not con-
trolling for general physical aggression) results in an even
greater statistically significant difference in parental physical
aggression between male and female nonparents, F(1, 103) ¼
13.38, p < .001.
Regarding parents, Levene's test of equality of error var-
iances revealed that the variance for parental physical aggres-
sion was homogenous, F(1, 110) ¼ 1.347, p ¼ .248. General
physical aggression was a significant covariate for parental
physical aggression, F(1, 109) ¼ 6.84, p ¼ .010. There was
no significant difference in parental physical aggression
between mothers and fathers while controlling for general
physical aggression, p ¼ .716. Estimated marginal means of
parental physical aggression for parents are presented in
Figure 2. An ANOVA (i.e., not controlling for general physical
aggression) results in no statistically significant difference
in parental physical aggression between mothers and fathers,
F(1, 110) ¼ .41, p ¼ .525.
Discussion
Parents reported higher parental physical aggression scores
than did nonparents, as expected, and therefore lended support
for basic validity of the items.

4 Evolutionary Psychology
The first hypothesis, that male nonparents would report
higher estimates of parental physical aggression than female
nonparents, was supported by the results. This result is consis-
tent with the broader finding that men's higher aggression is an
adaptation best explained by sexual selection (Archer, 2009).
Furthermore, it is an adaptation that can be utilized in different
ways to overcome different survival/reproductive challenges
(Buss, 2009), for example, protecting offspring by way of par-
ental physical aggression. One can speculate whether the latter
was adaptive in its own right, that is, whether paternal physical
aggression provided an increase in the survival of offspring to
the extent that a heritable trait for paternal physical aggression
was ``selected'' by sexual selection pressures. Although
humans have a long history of paternal investment (Gray &
Anderson, 2010), it is unclear how much of a role paternal
physical aggression played in that investment.
Obviously, women also have an ancestral past of parental
investment, so why were female nonparents' scores not equally
high as male nonparents' scores? Several reasons could
account for this and the reader is reminded that parental invest-
ment comes in many forms. Offspring protection is simply one
form. Females have many ways to engage in parental invest-
ment and many ways to engage in offspring protection that do
not include parental physical aggression. From a proximate
perspective, men's higher testosterone, lower fear aversion,
and greater risk taking are offered as reasons for the sex dif-
ference observed in this study.
A meta-analysis of risk-taking behavior reveals that men are
more likely to engage in a variety of risky behaviors including
gambling, dangerous driving, unprotected sex, and so on
(Byrnes et al., 1999). Another line of evidence to support the
idea that men demonstrate a greater willingness to engage in
risky behavior can be obtained from data from the Carnegie
Hero Fund, which ``awards the Carnegie Medal to individuals
in the United States and Canada who risk their lives to an
extraordinary degree saving or attempting to save the lives of
others.'' An analysis reveals that over 90% of the 7,000þ reci-
pients over the last several decades have been men (Kenrick,
Neuberg, & Cialdini, 2010). But perhaps the most salient
example of men's greater willingness to engage in risky beha-
vior with the most direct link to physical aggression is that men
are far more likely to commit homicide. Statistics from the
Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation Crime
Reports reveal that over 85% of homicides in the United States
in the last 50 years were committed by men (Kenrick et al.,
2010).
The second hypothesis, that fathers would report higher
estimates of parental physical aggression than mothers, was
not supported by the results. The results revealed no signif-
icant difference between the two groups. In addition, the
scores were relatively high for both mothers and fathers (as
they were for male nonparents). This outcome is interpreted
in light of women's higher minimum parental investment,
which drives sexual selection (Trivers, 1972) and the motiva-
tion to protect that investment. Also, adaptations related to
higher minimum parental investment may not get activated
until the actual onset of parenthood. Mothers' high parental
physical aggression scores are consistent with the majority of
female mammals that demonstrate maternal aggression.
Moreover, when faced with a situation in which the well-
being of a mother's child is threatened, fear aversion may
be reduced or overridden by the desire to protect one's child.
To reiterate from earlier, most of the sex difference in direct
aggression can be explained by women's higher fear aversion
(Campbell, 2006). One final thought regarding the lack of a
difference between mothers' and fathers' scores concerns a
study that reported fathers' help with child care had little
effect on child survival rates in a variety of human popula-
tions (Sear & Mace, 2008). If paternal investment in its var-
ious forms from child care to parental aggression is less
critical for offspring survival, then one might indeed expect
a high level of maternal physical aggression.
Regarding parents and nonparents, it may be of interest to
speculate on the difference between these two groups. Parental
physical aggression scores were relatively equally high
between fathers and male nonparents. However, mothers
reported higher scores than female nonparents. Similarly,
when asked ``How much would you physically harm an adult
who is kidnapping your child?'' the maximum score of 7 was
reported by 76% of mothers versus 58% of female nonparents,
and 70% of fathers versus 67% of male nonparents. Taken
together, the sex difference in estimates of parental physical
aggression may disappear with the experience of parenthood.
An example of such an experience is lactation; one study
reported that breast-feeding mothers demonstrated higher
aggression than formula-feeding mothers and childless
women (Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2011).
The results raise questions. One question is how the sex of a
child could influence the results of this study. Both mothers and
fathers interact differently with sons versus daughters before 2
or even 1 year of age (e.g., Jacklin, DiPietro, & Maccoby, 1984;
Snow, Jacklin, & Maccoby, 1983). However, differences in
how sons are treated versus daughters with nurturing behaviors
such as play may not have a correlation with protective beha-
viors such as parental physical aggression. Another question is
how the age of a child could influence the results of this study.
If maternal aggression among nonhuman animals eventually
decreases as offspring grow and gain independence, it may
be the case that younger children may elicit higher parental
physical aggression than older children.
The study had limitations. First, the self-report measures
may not accurately reflect what participants would do in a
real-world setting. For example, as stated earlier, many parti-
cipants selected the maximum score for the last item in the
survey, that is, reporting that they would use enough physical
harm to kill an adult who was kidnapping their child. This may
reflect a ceiling effect or it may represent the maximum amount
of aggression that could be expressed. That is, arguably, there is
little aggression that could be expressed beyond killing some-
one. Alternatively, it is possible that these scores may exagge-
rate actual parental physical aggression. Second, this study's
assessment of parental physical aggression was limited to 3
Steiner 5
items. More items would produce more information about a
wider range of threats to a parent's child, and more information
about participants' potential nonphysical aggression responses.
Identifying the sex of the target (the one who is threatening a
child) could also provide useful information, given that both
sexes are more aggressive toward men (Davidovic, Bell,
Ferguson, Gorski, & Campbell, 2011).
Future studies could address these limitations and examine
the role of testosterone in parental physical aggression. Testos-
terone has positive correlations with aggression (Archer, 2006)
and negative correlations with parenting contexts (Gray &
Anderson, 2010). Also, fathers tend to have lower baseline
testosterone than male nonfathers (e.g., Gray, Yang, & Pope,
2006). Little research has been done to compare baseline testos-
terone levels between mothers and female nonparents, but a cou-
ple of studies suggest the pattern is the same as for males, that is,
mothers have lower testosterone than female nonparents (e.g.,
Barrett et al., 2013; Kuzawa, Gettler, Huang, & McDade, 2010).
In closing, parental investment comes in various forms from
changing a diaper to helping a child with homework to off-
spring protection. The latter also comes in various forms from
monitoring a child's meals for allergens to insisting a child
wear a helmet for bicycling to parental physical aggression.
The latter yet again comes in various forms. Understanding
this hierarchical relationship among parental physical aggres-
sion, offspring protection, and parental investment, as well as
understanding the associated sex differences can help refine
our understanding of the broader literature on aggression.
Numerous studies have demonstrated men's higher physical
aggression. Few contexts may be able to demonstrate higher
or even equal levels of physical aggression in women compared
to men, and maternal aggression may be one such context.
