Introduction
Recognition of the intersection of social policy and science
and technology has long been associated with calls for and
attempts at various forms of public engagement. In this con-
text, what precisely is meant by public participation and how
processes for engagement are envisaged vary quite dramati-
cally (Fung, 2006; O'Doherty & Einsiedel, 2012; Rowe &
Frewer, 2005). A tension in these discussions has been
whether public engagement is seen as a largely unidirec-
tional effort at educating lay publics in particular areas of
science, versus more dialogic processes in which lay publics
are informed about particular issues, and given opportunities
to provide input in associated social policy (Castle & Culver,
2006). This tension is particularly salient in areas where
scientific questions and technological solutions are inter-
twined with broader social issues. In such cases, public
deliberation as a specific form of public engagement seems
to offer valuable pathways for involving publics in the gov-
ernance of science and technology and the particular contro-
versies in which they are embedded.
In this article, we present a case study of an engagement
event "Explosives, Genomics, and the Environment: A
Public Deliberation" (or RDX Talk, for short). RDX is an
explosive used in mining, avalanche control, and by the mili-
tary. The compound is relatively inexpensive and easy to
handle, which makes it a preferred choice compared with
alternatives. However, RDX is also a neurotoxin and impli-
cated in various adverse health outcomes. Owing to the large
amounts of RDX that have been used across the globe in the
past few decades, concern is growing about the potential
environmental and human health implications. To this end,
different approaches for the remediation of RDX are being
investigated and developed. One such method involves the
use of naturally occurring microorganisms (Gordonia and
Rhodococcus) in the bioremediation of RDX. Little is known
about the precise mechanisms by which RDX is degraded by
these bacteria, and current efforts are underway to under-
stand this process of bioremediation of RDX.
Together, these scientific, technological, and environmen-
tal problems intersect with the social and political sphere on

Abstract
RDX is an explosive that is also a neurotoxin and implicated in adverse health outcomes. Because of its widespread use
in military and civilian operations, there is growing concern about potential environmental and health implications. One
promising method of bioremediation involves genomic studies of soil microbes. These health concerns and technological
issues intersect with social and political dimensions raising questions about public responses to genomic technologies and
the degree of environmental accounting expected from the military. In cases of novel technologies entering into contested
social spaces, public engagement can be useful to inform broader policy debates. Building on previous work, in this article, we
outline the rationale, methods, and results of a public deliberation on these issues.To our knowledge, this is the first study of
its kind on the issues of RDX pollution and microbial genomics, and thus provides an important baseline on public sentiment
on these issues.

a number of dimensions. For instance, as has been found in
the case of food and livestock, there is conflation in public
understandings of genomics and transgenic technologies
(Tansey & Burgess, 2008). Would this conflation carry over
to public understandings of microbial genomics, and what
might a public response to the use of genetically modified
(GM) microbes look like? The Canadian military (along with
other armed forces around the world) rely heavily on the use
of RDX. Given that their primary mandate is one of defence,
should these institutions be held to the same environmental
standards as civilian organizations, or should special dispen-
sations be made? Given the widespread use of RDX, how
should trade-offs between its utility to society and the poten-
tial damage to health and the environment be managed?
These questions suggest that policy surrounding pollut-
ants like RDX and technologies involving microbial genom-
ics should at least take into consideration public perspectives
on the issue. However, the relatively obscure nature of both
the social issues (RDX pollution) and the science (microbial
genomics and bioremediation) suggests that typical social
scientific methods of surveys, polls, or focus groups will not
work in this case. As argued elsewhere (MacKenzie &
O'Doherty, 2011), low public awareness of the issues as well
as lack of understanding of relevant technical information
limit the usefulness of traditional methods of engagement.
However, a deliberative forum tailored to the issues at hand
offers a robust mechanism for developing meaningful public
input on these issues.
In this article, we outline the rationale, methods, and
results of RDX Talk. To our knowledge, this is the first
study of its kind on the issues of RDX pollution and micro-
bial genomics, and thus provides an important baseline on
public sentiment on these issues. The methods used in our
study build on previous work on public deliberation on
other areas of science and technology (see Burgess,
O'Doherty, & Secko, 2008; O'Doherty, Hawkins, &
Burgess, 2012, on human tissue biobanking; and O'Doherty,
Burgess, & Secko, 2010, on salmon genomics), though we
also present several methodological refinements. In particu-
lar, RDX Talk involved issues that required participants
themselves to play a substantive role in setting the agenda
and structuring their own deliberations on this issue. We
thus illustrate a methodological refinement that allows
members of the public to provide input not only on their
preferences in the context of a range of preformulated pol-
icy options but also in identifying those areas of concern
they most want to provide input on.
The primary goals of this article are to (a) gain under-
standing of how a diverse sample of the public responds to
novel and potentially controversial uses of science and tech-
nology; (b) report on the deliberative conclusions of a pub-
lic forum on social, ethical, and political concerns related to
RDX contamination and the use of microbial genomics in
bioremediation; (c) extend and further evaluate a model of
public deliberation; and (d) illustrate the effectiveness of
certain methodological refinements in conducting public
deliberation.
RDX: Health, Environmental, and
Regulatory Concerns
RDX is a cheap, powerful explosive compound (Maleh,
Carvalho-Knighton, & Martin, 2009). Unlike more unstable
explosives, RDX does not react to low levels of heat, shock,
or friction, which makes it relatively safe to handle (Global
Security, 2006). RDX is used in demolition, mining, road
construction, avalanche prevention, as well as military appli-
cations in both combat and training operations (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, 2010). It has been stated
that "RDX is currently the most important military explosive
in the world" (Global Security, 2006; Maleh et al., 2009, p.
254). However, detailed information about the precise volume
and nature of usage within the military is not available.
By its very nature RDX is associated with violent conse-
quences. However, RDX is also associated with less obvious
forms of damage. RDX is a neurotoxin that interferes with the
brain and nervous system, causing seizures and disorientation
if exposed to in high doses (Maleh et al., 2009; Williams et
al., 2011). Frequent and long-term exposure through inhala-
tion has produced convulsions, headaches, nausea and vomit-
ing, loss of consciousness, disorientation, and temporary loss
of memory. Ingestion of RDX produces similar symptoms
(Kucukavdalt et al., 2003). Recovery appears to be complete
when exposure to RDX is discontinued (Hoek, 2004;
Kucukavdalt et al., 2003; Maleh et al., 2009; Williams et al.,
2011). Experiments with rats and mice indicate other nega-
tive effects that result from exposure, including decreased
offspring weight, genital and urinary tract sores, liver and
kidney damage, reduced fertility, and mortality (e.g., Bannon,
Dillman, Hable, Phillips, & Perkins, 2009; Card &Autenrieth,
1998). Although there is no conclusive evidence that RDX
causes cancer in humans, research has suggested a link
between exposure and cancer in lab animals (Hoek, 2004;
Maleh et al., 2009; Munch & National Exposure Research
Laboratory, 2002; Ryu, Han, Jung, Bae, & Nam, 2007). As a
result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
has identified RDX as a possible carcinogen, and placed it on
a list of Emerging Chemicals of Concern (ECC) and the 2009
Contaminant Candidate List (CCL; USEPA, 2011).
Remediation procedures for RDX have included: remov-
ing contaminated soil and dumping it in approved sites,
incineration in furnaces or open-air kilns, and the introduc-
tion of additional chemicals to neutralize pollutants (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for
Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2010). Because
many of these methods are themselves associated with envi-
ronmental damage, researchers are pursing alternative tech-
nologies that use plants and microbes for remediation
(bioremediation; Card & Autenrieth, 1998; Maleh et al.,
O'Doherty et al. 3
2009). Grains, such as rice (Vila, Mehier, Lorber-Pascal, &
Laurent, 2007), and several other plants (Rylott et al., 2006)
have been tested and shown to remediate soils effectively.
Researchers are also using GM plants to assist in the removal
of RDX from contaminated soil (Van Aken, 2009). Certain
microbes have been identified that have natural capabilities
that could help with cleaning up pollution, including RDX.
Specifically, naturally occurring microbes called Gordonia
(Indest et al., 2010) and Rhodococcus (Andeer, Stahl, Bruce,
& Strand, 2009) have the capability to degrade RDX (K. T.
Thompson, Crocker, & Fredrickson, 2005). Because these
methods are still being evaluated, they are not yet approved
for extensive use.
In Canada, the regulation of RDX use and cleanup falls
under the responsibility of a variety of agencies and is subject
to multiple pieces of legislation. The primary regulation per-
taining to RDX is the Canadian Environmental Protection
Act (CEPA; Department of Justice Canada, 2011). CEPA
regulations apply broadly to private industry and government
agencies. However, the legislation does not limit powers
granted under the National Defence Act or any other piece of
legislation relating to national defence and security. It is
accepted that National Defence training has to occur under
realistic conditions, but still comply with environmental reg-
ulations. However, the Department of National Defence is not
required to conduct environmental impact assessments each
time explosives are used, which would be the norm for any
other industrial or government agency in Canada.
Substances introduced in Canada after 1994 are consid-
ered "new chemicals" and need to be assessed for environ-
mental safety through the submission of toxicological
information. RDX was used before 1994 when environmen-
tal protection was not the norm. It is classified as an "exist-
ing substance," and any related health or environmental
impacts of the chemical have not been thoroughly examined.
RDX appears as a low risk compound on the Domestic
Substances List (DSL) of Environment Canada (2010),
which is the sole basis for determining whether a substance
should be evaluated.
Method
The present study involved engaging participants in a pro-
cess of deliberation, in which they were informed of the
issues and given an opportunity to discuss, form opinions,
and challenge each other's positions in a respectful manner.
A specific goal was to achieve legitimate public input that
could be useful from a social policy perspective in address-
ing the problems of RDX pollution and the costs and poten-
tial risks of bioremediation. The design of the RDX
deliberation was based on previous work on human tissue
biobanking (Burgess et al., 2008; O'Doherty et al., 2012)
and salmon genomics (O'Doherty et al., 2010). This body of
work asserts that the particular format of a public engage-
ment must be tailored to the type of issue to be discussed. As
a refinement on this previous work, RDX Talk involved
engaging participants not only in deliberation about different
preformulated policy options but also in identifying issues
that are of primary concern and in working toward collec-
tively formulating policy recommendations on those issues.
Public Deliberation
Deliberative democratic theory centers on the notion that for
some issues, at certain times, a simple vote for a political
representative is insufficient to provide for meaningful
democratic decision making. When an issue is particularly
politicized or contentious, or when a policy decision requires
input from a large range of perspectives, opening the subject
to meaningful public debate, and drawing on the outcomes
of this debate in the formulation of policy, may be warranted
(Dryzek, 1990; Fishkin & Laslett, 2003; Gastil, 2008;
Warren, 1996). Public debates of this sort can be fostered in
town hall meetings, on Internet forums, or in publicized
media debates. More recently, carefully designed participa-
tory governance processes have been applied to issues
involving science and technology (Burgess & Tansey, 2008;
Hamlett, 2003). In this context, it has been argued that early
or "upstream" development is likely to be most beneficial,
such that broader inputs can be taken into account in the
ways in which a technology is developed, the forms it takes
when introduced into society, and the ways in which it inter-
faces with various institutional interests and value systems
(Wynne, 2001). Once a technology or contentious issue has
been fully developed, once it has become embedded in insti-
tutional practices and the day-to-day living of large numbers
of people, once interest groups and political commitments
have formed, it is far more difficult to act on the input from
deliberative democratic forums.
Recruitment
The aim of recruitment was to assemble a sample that was
sufficiently diverse to represent the views and interests of
individuals and groups residing in the province, while being
small enough to be financially and logistically feasible and
enable meaningful dialogue between participants. To achieve
these goals, we relied on the theoretical construct of a mini-
public (Brown, 2006; Goodin & Dryzek, 2006), a small
forum of members of the public that is chosen strategically
to provide a legitimate public voice on some question of
public policy. While it is not possible in a small sample to
achieve statistically significant representation across all
demographically relevant variables, it is possible to con-
struct a small sample in such a way as to maximize diversity
and minimize selection bias (Longstaff & Burgess, 2010).
To this end, we aimed to achieve a randomly selected demo-
graphically stratified sample of 25 participants, with mini-
mum selection filters to ensure representation of particular
perspectives relevant to the topic.

A recruitment firm assisted in randomly selecting 5,000
households, stratified across various regions in the greater
Vancouver area via publicly accessible postal codes. Each
household was sent a letter inviting one household member
to enter a "civic lottery" draw, as well as a list of "frequently
asked questions" regarding RDX, public deliberation, and
the reasons behind organizing the event. Interested individu-
als then mailed a response postcard, containing basic demo-
graphic information, to the recruitment firm. In total, 138
positive responses were received. The final group was
selected from these responses using stratified random selec-
tion to obtain a sample approximately proportional to the
population of British Columbia in terms of age, sex, ethnic-
ity, and geographical area (see Table 1). The sample was also
constructed to include individuals who (a) have had some
training in explosives or toxic materials, (b) have a personal
or familial connection to the armed forces, and/or (c) con-
sider themselves indigenous Canadian.
Given the topic of the deliberation, it was deemed that
individuals from these backgrounds would provide important
perspectives (see Table 2). If recruitment had relied only on
random selection, it would have been unlikely that individu-
als with these perspectives would have been included.
Including those with connections to the military was thought
necessary to ensure that the deliberation was not biased from
the start against military perspectives. It was also deemed
important to include First Nations' voices given the complex
relationship betweenAboriginal governance and the Canadian
state in issues of land stewardship.
To account for attrition, 30 individuals were invited to the
deliberation. In all, 26 registered on the 1st day. Of these, 25
attended and contributed substantively throughout the event
and toward the final recommendations of the forum.
Information Materials
The complexity and relative obscurity of the many issues
related to RDX required that participants be given access to
balanced and comprehensive, yet succinct, information.
Importantly, however, information provision was not an aim
in and of itself. Rather, the aim was to provide sufficient and
unbiased1 information as a foundation for meaningful delib-
eration to be able to take place. Information was provided
through a booklet, by expert speakers at the event, and
through a dedicated website.
The booklet ("Explosives and the Environment: A Public
Deliberation") was written specifically for the event and
included information on the following topics: the nature, his-
tory, and uses of RDX; the consequences of RDX pollution
and its effect on human health; the range of cleanup and
remediation techniques; and the current regulatory context
for use of RDX in Canada. The booklet was written at a
Grade 10 reading level but based on information sourced
from the peer-reviewed literature, and it was checked for sci-
entific accuracy by experts in the field. The booklet was
mailed to each participant before the event and an electronic
copy was made available on the website (www.rdxtalk.org).
Four speakers with relevant expertise were invited to
the event. During the 1st day of the event, each speaker
gave a presentation, and participants had the opportunity
to ask questions immediately after the presentation and
during a panel discussion with all speakers. After the 1st
day, the research team acted as liaison between partici-
pants and the expert speakers when new questions emerged
or additional information was requested. Expert speakers
did not participate in the actual deliberations as mixing lay
and expert voices in deliberation has been shown to poten-
tially marginalize the views of nonexperts (Kerr,
Cunningham-Burley, & Tutton, 2007; see also O'Doherty
& Davidson, 2010). The four speakers provided informa-
tion and perspectives on
1. why RDX is an environmental problem, and the cur-
rently available remediation strategies, including the
advantages and disadvantages of each strategy;
2. the (Canadian) provincial and federal regulations
that might come to bear on RDX use and remedia-
tion, focusing on the complexity of various inter-
dependent sets of legislation and the lack of clarity
regarding precisely which regulations might be the
O'Doherty et al. 5
most relevant to the use of RDX and responsibili-
ties for cleanup;
3. the science behind understanding the role of soil
microbes responsible for biodegrading RDX; and
4. source water protection, the relative impact of vari-
ous human activities on water quality, and avenues
for managing water pollution.
A website was constructed specifically for this project
(www.rdxtalk.org). Potential participants were directed to
the website in the initial recruitment letter. The site provided
information about the planned deliberation, the topic, and
the research team. A private section of the website, accessi-
ble only to confirmed participants, included detailed infor-
mation about the speakers and their presentations, additional
readings, event schedules, and an electronic copy of the
booklet. It was also used during the deliberation to post
notes or thoughts of individual participants.
Event Design
RDX Talk was staged over two weekends in April 2010 with
an intervening weekend to allow participants to further
reflect on the issues and to discuss them with friends and
family before the second weekend of deliberation. Overall,
the event can be roughly divided into three phases: (1) infor-
mation provision, (2) agenda setting, and (3) formulation of
policy recommendations. The 1st day of the event was
geared toward information provision (Phase 1), and allow-
ing participants to get used to the practice of deliberation.
All speaker presentations and the expert panel took place on
this day. Day 2 was dedicated to participants collectively
identifying the most important issues for which they wanted
to develop recommendations (Phase 2: agenda setting). The
second weekend (Days 3 and 4) was dedicated to delibera-
tion and developing group recommendations on the items
identified on Day 2 (Phase 3: policy recommendations).
Participants also completed a pre- and postdeliberation sur-
vey immediately prior to and after the event, and a final
one-on-one telephone interview was conducted with each
participant between 4 and 6 weeks after the event.
Discussions were conducted in small breakaway groups
and the large group consisting of all 25 participants. All dis-
cussions were moderated by members of the research team
who had prior experience in group facilitation and in con-
ducting public deliberation. Based on principles from delib-
erative democracy (see, for example, Gastil & Levine, 2005),
the practice of deliberation involves participants working
together to become informed on an issue, and working
toward collective positions while providing reasoned argu-
ments for their own positions and being open to considering
others' positions. Ideally, good deliberative practices will
ensure that participants are respectful toward each other and
treated as equals. Participants should justify their own posi-
tions and be open to having their positions challenged by
others. Finally, any conclusions that are reached should be a
reflection of the deliberating groups' efforts to find common
ground (Chambers, 2003; Hamlett & Cobb, 2006). In con-
trast to simply exchanging views, deliberation involves jus-
tifying positions in an effort to work toward a collective
resolution of issues. Background materials and responses to
technical questions were intended to enhance participants'
technical knowledge as well as their confidence in engaging
with the subject matter and arriving at policy advice.
Furthermore, recruiting for diversity of life experience and
facilitating the discussions to ensure that all participants felt
comfortable contributing helped ensure that a broad range of
considerations and perspectives was reflected in the deliber-
ative conclusions of the group.
In a refinement of previous deliberations, participants in
RDX Talk were themselves engaged in setting the agenda for
issues they wanted to discuss. This approach is different from
many other mini-public processes. In many cases, those who
convene mini-publics decide which issues (and subtopics) will
be addressed before the deliberation takes place (Abelson et
al., 2007). The British Columbia CitizenAssembly's mandate,
for example, was restricted to examining the mechanics of
elections and excluded other related topics, such as redistrict-
ing, election finance, and the size of the legislature (Warren &
Pearse, 2008). Similarly, Fishkin's (1995) Deliberative Polls
often have quite specific (and restricted) mandates (as, for
example, the deliberative poll [DP] on whether Australia
should become a republic, 1999). In most cases, such con-
straints are appropriate as public deliberations are arguably
most productive when they are focused. Constraints also help
ensure that the results of deliberation can be acted on by policy
makers (O'Doherty & Hawkins, 2010).
In other cases, however, it can be problematic to constrain
deliberation to preidentified issues and concerns. This is
most likely to be the case where
1. policy-making bodies are fragmented, with uncer-
tainty about where initiatives for new policy or
policy changes should be located;
2. there is little or no social scientific research, such
that there are no analyses that can be drawn on to
evaluate the impact of these issues on public wel-
fare and values; and
3. there is little or no public discourse on an issue.
Consequently, no assumptions can be made about
the relative salience of aspects of an issue that
might need to be reflected in policy options.
In such cases, public deliberations themselves can help
determine which issues require more attention. For example,
in the case of biobanking, the results of an initial unstruc-
tured public deliberation (O'Doherty & Burgess, 2009) were
used to inform and constrain the specific issues that were
addressed in a subsequent mini-public deliberation
(O'Doherty et al., 2012). At RDX Talk, the first weekend
was dedicated to participants themselves identifying those
topics that they felt were most important to address, setting
6 SAGE Open
the agenda for the second weekend of deliberation. RDX
Talk was therefore designed with separate phases for agenda
setting and formulation of policy recommendations (see
above). In the agenda-setting phase (Phase 2), participants
collectively worked toward identifying the issues they
deemed most important and listing them as items for which
they wanted to make recommendations. The items tabled for
deliberation in Phase 3 (policy recommendations) were thus
not imposed by the research team, government agendas, or
other vested interests. Rather, they were developed in the
public forum itself in consideration of the opinions and posi-
tions of all participants.
In Phase 3 (formulation of policy recommendations), each
agenda item was discussed in small group sessions before
being deliberated in the larger group. The aim of the small
group discussions was for all participants to be able to express
their opinions and explore the issue being considered in depth
and to provide a foundation from which the large group dis-
cussion could proceed; the small groups were not expected to
make collective decisions during this phase of the process. In
contrast, the aim of the large group was to work toward col-
lective statements endorsed by the group itself. The nominal
goal of the large group discussion was to reach agreement on
each item but facilitators did not push for consensus when
persistent disagreements emerged. Rather, the aim was to
explore disagreements and, when they could not be resolved
through deliberation, articulate and document clearly the
nature of the disagreement. Deliberation of each issue was
concluded with a vote that was recorded together with a col-
lective statement of the group. The vote helped ensure that the
facilitator would not assume a consensus had been formed
owing to the absence of voices raised against a particular
proposition. This allowed the facilitator to draw out detailed
reasoning on both the proposition being considered and any
alternate views still held by participants at this point in time
(Moore & O'Doherty, 2012). Each vote also provided an
explicit transition from one issue to the next.
After the event, the research team produced a report of all
collectively forged recommendations and articulated dis-
agreements. This document represents the official conclu-
sions of this public deliberation. The report was sent out to
participants for review and ratification.
Survey
Participants were asked to complete a 20-item survey before
and after the deliberation. The survey had two purposes.
First, it provides a quantitative record of individual opinions
independent of the collective statements developed in the
deliberation. Second, there is a recognized need for empiri-
cal evaluation of deliberative processes (De Vries et al.,
2010; Rowe, Horlick-Jones, Walls, Poortinga, & Pidgeon,
2008; D. F. Thompson, 2008).
The items in the survey were developed by the research
team to represent the possible range of social and ethical
issues pertaining to RDX use, pollution, and remediation.
Each item had five response categories: strongly agree,
somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree, and
don't know (a copy of the survey is available from the
authors on request).
Results
There is no one immediately obvious way of presenting the
results of a deliberation. In particular, there is a tension
between analysts' attempts at synthesizing the main themes
of discussion after the deliberation has taken place and
allowing the statements of deliberants to stand as they are
without analytical synthesis. Individual deliberants are
actively encouraged to reconsider their positions in light of
new information and other perspectives, and may conse-
quently change their opinions. Analyses therefore need to
differentiate between individual opinions expressed in dis-
cussion, themes emerging from analyses of the entire delib-
eration, and collective statements ratified by the group. We
term these collective statements deliberative outputs
(O'Doherty & Burgess, 2009). Although post hoc analyses
conducted on transcripts of a public engagement may pro-
vide important insights, deliberative outputs arguably have
more political legitimacy because they represent collective
positions arrived at and ratified through democratic delibera-
tion. In this section, we report these collectively forged and
ratified "deliberative outputs" as well as a range of selected
survey results.
Deliberative Outputs
During the agenda-setting phase of the deliberation, partici-
pants collectively decided on the following seven topics that
would be placed on the agenda for discussion and for which
policy recommendations would be developed:
1. The Costs Associated With RDX Use
2. Research and Development Priorities
3. Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX
4. Remediation of RDX
5. The Military As a Special User of RDX
6. Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation
7. Public Education and Information Pertaining to
RDX
Discussion on the second weekend was aimed at devel-
oping specific policy recommendations for each of these
issues. In total, 25 members of the public contributed to the
discussion, although 2 members were unable to attend all
the sessions of the second weekend. As such, the totals
recorded below vary between 23 and 25. Some of the rec-
ommendations were unanimous and therefore represent the
opinion of the group as a whole. Where full consensus was
not achieved, disagreements were articulated and recorded.
Last, a vote was taken as a measure of support for each
recommendation.
O'Doherty et al. 7
1. The Costs Associated With RDX Use
Policy Recommendation:
In general, the direct costs of RDX use seem to be well recognized. We recommend that when formulating policy on
RDX, the following indirect/intangible costs should be considered:
·
· Health and safety costs
·
· Health care system costs
·
· Environmental costs
·
· Costs of not using RDX/using alternatives (alternatives may be worse)
·
· Costs to the military of not using RDX (effectiveness of alternatives)
·
· Regulatory costs
·
· Research costs (cost of researching alternatives to RDX or cleanup costs)
Assessments of costs should depend in part on situation-specific environmental assessments and budgetary
constraints.
All 25 participants supported this as a recommendation of the group. However, there was disagreement as to whether
the military should be included in the recommendation. In all, 9 participants felt that the military should be excluded from
the recommendation, whereas 16 participants felt that the military should be included. In addition, 23 participants felt that
this recommendation should also apply to other neurotoxins, whereas 2 participants did not. Those who did not were
concerned that the recommendations would have limited policy impact if they were too broad and not specific to RDX.
2. Research and Development Priorities
Policy Recommendation:
Research into RDX remediation, RDX alternatives, and RDX effects are each important. With that in mind, the research
priorities should be in the following order:
1. Research into the current uses and effects of RDX to establish the extent and impact of RDX use in terms of
environmental pollution and human health effects
2. Research into remediation of RDX pollution
3. Research into alternatives to RDX
These research priorities should be amended over time once the major backlog of remediation and RDX cleanup has
taken place. At that point, priorities should change, so that the primary focus of research is into alternatives for RDX
(in particular, alternatives that are cost-effective and green/environmentally friendly).
All 25 participants agreed on this recommendation.

3. Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX
No policy recommendation emerged on this issue owing to a split in the eventual positions adopted by participants. A
vote was held on each position with the following results:
Position 1: (support for Position 9 of 25)
There is currently not sufficient evidence that the harms of RDX justify a mandated reduction or ban.
Qualification:
·
· Remediation of RDX pollution should still take place.
Position 2: (support for Position 14 of 25)
Based on current information, we should aim for a phased reduction of RDX.
Qualifications:
·
· Mechanisms to encourage reduction could include mechanisms, such as taxes or tariffs.
·
· Remediation of RDX should still take place.
Nine of 25 participants supported Position 1, and 14 supported Position 2. One participant abstained from the vote
due to a belief that a new coordinating governance body was needed to make this decision.
4. Remediation of RDX
Policy Recommendation A (regarding remediation):
Situation-specific assessments are required to determine the most appropriate remediation technique. Remediation
should be timely and subject to regulatory approval.
Given constraints identified in situation-specific assessments, natural solutions to remediation are preferred, including
microbes, plants, photoreaction, and composting.
Qualifications:
·
· If less preferred options are used, such as chemicals or incineration, a careful justification must be provided.
·
· An important consideration in choosing a remediation method is to avoid the production of other harmful sub-
stances.
·
· Use of preferred remediation methods over other options may justify higher financial costs and longer remedia-
tion completion time.
This position was supported by 24 of 24 participants.
Policy Recommendation B (regarding bioremediation utilizing genetically modified organisms [GMOs]):
It is necessary to conduct further research into the usefulness and safety of GM microbes and GM plants for the biore-
mediation of RDX. This needs to occur prior to the development of regulations, followed by carefully managed field
trials and possible general use.
Qualifications:
·
· There is a preference for cross-breeding over genetic modification.
·
· In terms of GM, there is a preference for methods in which plants are unable to reproduce and organisms that
are noninvasive.
O'Doherty et al. 9
There was contention regarding the inclusion of the term carefully managed field trials in this recommendation. In
all, 18 participants supported inclusion of this phrase, whereas 5participants did not think field trials would be appropri-
ate because of the risk of GM organisms being released into the environment. One individual abstained.
Once the option to include or exclude the term carefully managed field trials had been documented, 21 of 24 partici-
pants supported the above statement regarding bioremediation. The 3 participants who did not support the recommenda-
tion expressed the concerns that bioremediation was not necessarily acceptable and that "preference" was not a strong
enough statement.
5.The Military As a Special User of RDX
Policy Recommendation A:
The military has an obligation to conform to regulations in terms of remediation of RDX.
Eighteen of 23 participants supported Recommendation A. Those who did not did so on the grounds that they did not
believe this recommendation was feasible for implementation outside of Canada.
Policy Recommendation B:
The military has an obligation to conform to regulations in terms of remediation of RDX in Canada.
Twenty-two of 23 participants supported Recommendation B. The participant who did not support it thought that the
recommendation should be strengthened by stipulating that the military should provide justifications as to why they
would not need to remediate in other countries.
Policy Recommendation C:
In general, the military's use of RDX should be subject to the same regulations as nonmilitary users. There are excep-
tional circumstances where there should be some flexibility such as when the military is in conflict.
Twenty of 23 participants supported Recommendation C. Of the 3 participants who did not, 2 felt that the term excep-
tional circumstances should be removed as it is subjective and weakens the statement and 1 felt that the statement could
not be made as the military cannot be regulated.
6. Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation
Policy Recommendation:
Recognizing that there are some existing regulations in place, we want regulations on RDX to address the following:
·
· A lack of transparency
·
· Accountability
·
· Enforcement of regulations
·
· Oversight
·
· Competency on both a provincial and federal level
·
· Recognizing RDX as a hazardous substance
·
· User responsibility (including fiscally) for total remediation
·
· Human and environmental risks
·
· Control of RDX use/distribution (so that it does not fall into the wrong hands, for example, terrorists)
Twenty-three of 23 participants supported this recommendation.

7. Public Education and Information Pertaining to
RDX
Specific recommendations on the issues of public education
and information could not be made due to time constraints.
However, general discussion regarding this topic did occur
and the following points were considered. Note that as no
consensus-oriented discussion or voting took place for this
issue, some items may be in disagreement with others.
·
· The overall objective of informing the public is
good. However, public resources for education are
already stretched, and should not be used for RDX
information. Moreover, governmental bodies may
not be the best people to do this.
·
· Information should be limited, and issues should be
kept in perspective.
·
· News broadcasts and local newspaper articles could
help foster discussion and education.
·
· A website containing information would be helpful.
·
· Public discussion should be targeted toward RDX
and RDX remediation.
·
· Politicians are supposed to act as our representa-
tives, so if we are concerned as citizens then politi-
cians should act on our behalf.
·
· RDX discussion should be incorporated into
broader issues, such as the environment and health,
which are on the political agenda.
·
· A more public focus on RDX is justified and is
unlikely to detract from other, more important
issues that are on the political agenda.
Survey
The conclusions listed above represent the product of a
dynamic and deliberative process. As such, they are a col-
lective achievement that is emergent from the process of
deliberation. In contrast, the survey contained questions
that were determined prior to the deliberation taking place.
Analyses of predeliberation responses provide some insight
into the views of a lay public on issues relevant to RDX use
and remediation. These responses should have some simi-
larity to the views of the general public, at least in com-
parison with the deliberative conclusions of the forum,
which are purposefully informed and deliberative in nature.
Analyses of pre- and postevent responses provide some
insight into patterns of opinion change and formation over
the course of the event.
Although the survey was developed before the event,
many of the survey questions are closely associated with the
list of topics identified in the agenda-setting phase and
addressed in the group's deliberations. In particular, the sur-
vey included items related to the following deliberative
conclusions:
·
· The Costs Associated With RDX Use (Issue No. 1)
·
· Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX (Issue
No. 3)
·
· Remediation of RDX (Issue No. 4)
·
· The Military As a Special User of RDX (Issue No.
5)
·
· Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation (Issue
No. 6)
For each issue, we examine responses from the pre- and
postevent surveys. For the purposes of this article, we pro-
vide descriptive statistics only.
The Costs AssociatedWith RDX Use
One of the strongest recommendations called for an account-
ing of the intangible costs of using pollutants like RDX. The
group agreed that, in the future, all associated costs, includ-
ing those related to health and environmental concerns,
should be considered and that financial considerations alone
do not adequately reflect the impacts the chemical has, or
might have, on humans, animals, and nature more generally.
Two survey items are closely related to this deliberative
conclusion (see Tables 3 and 4).
Table 3 shows that the group was strongly committed to
environmental values. Given the choice between creating
jobs and protecting the environment, 76.9% chose in favor of
the environment in the first wave of the survey, whereas
73.9% chose the environment in the second wave of the sur-
vey. This result contrasts to data from the 2008 Canadian
Election Study in which respondents were asked the same

question. In that survey, 46.8% of respondents in British
Columbia agreed or strongly agreed with that statement.2 It
appears that participants in RDX Talk were strongly commit-
ted to environmental objectives and this is reflected in their
decision to recommend a broad-based accounting of both
financial and "intangible" costs associated with the use and
remediation of RDX.
As shown in Table 4, a majority of participants before and
after the deliberation were worried about the potential health
risks of RDX. This, again, is reflected in the group's recom-
mendation to account for health costs as well as any financial
costs that may be associated with the use and remediation of
RDX.
Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX
A majority of participants in the deliberative forum recom-
mended that the use of RDX should be reduced and eventu-
ally phased out; however, the recommendation was not
supported unanimously, and in fact, had a relatively large
minority in opposition. Importantly, the recommendation
does not include a stipulation of a complete (immediate or
eventual) ban on the use of RDX in Canada. Despite rec-
ommending new, clear, and comprehensive regulations of
RDX, the group did not view an outright ban as desirable
or feasible. This division of opinion is also reflected in the
survey responses, and in particular in postdeliberation
responses. As shown in Table 5, before the deliberation,
26.9% of participants supported banning RDX in Canada.
However, 19.2% either disagreed or strongly disagreed
with this option. It is interesting that a majority entered the
deliberation unsure whether banning RDX would be an
appropriate policy response. In contrast, after the delibera-
tion, all but two participants expressed an opinion on
whether RDX should be banned. The rest were split on this
issue with 47.8% in general agreement that it should be
banned and 43.5% saying that it should not be banned.
Remediation of RDX
The survey contained one item pertaining to the use of
microbial technologies for remediation. As shown in Table
6, 52% of participants agreed or strongly agreed with this
statement before the deliberation compared with 72.7% in
the postdeliberation survey. Importantly, the number of
"don't know" responses fell from an initial 48.0% to only
9.09% in the postdeliberation wave.
In addition to the question on microbial remediation, the
survey also measured sentiment toward GMO technologies,
and GM microbes specifically. Although targeted genetic
modification of microbes for the purposes of remediation of
RDX is (to our knowledge) currently not being considered,
the possibility of using GM microbes for remediation does
exist and has been trialed previously for other pollutants
(Brazil et al., 1995). Items pertaining to GMOs were included
in the survey to assess the general sentiment of the group
toward these technologies.
Even though the public forum as a whole endorsed the use
of GM microbes for remediation purposes with certain pre-
cautions (see deliberative conclusion above), it is notewor-
thy that individual participants were much more divided in
their orientation toward GMO technologies. As shown in
Table 7, in the predeliberation survey, 42.3% agreed that, in
general, GMO technologies cause more problems than they
solve. After deliberation--and in spite of developing a col-
lective statement that genomic technologies and microbes
should be developed and used, but only after extensive (and
safe) testing--40.9% remained committed in their general
opposition to these technologies. Again, the number of
"don't know" responses fell from an initial 34.6% to only
9.09% in the post-deliberation.

Finally, participants were asked to respond to the state-
ment: "Genetically modified microbes are unnatural organ-
isms" (Table 8). The notion of "natural" is of course vague
and problematic theoretically, and we use it here not to imply
that a neat line can be drawn between "natural" and "unnatu-
ral" organisms. The point of the question, rather, was to
gauge participants' general disposition toward the idea of
GM microbes. The results are revealing in that a majority of
responses indicated agreement with the statement that GM
organisms are unnatural, pre-deliberation (52%) and post-
deliberation (59%), indicating a substantive degree of oppo-
sition to the idea of using GM microbes independent of the
knowledge and insights gained during deliberation.
The Military As a Special User of RDX
Given that national defence is considered by many to be an
overriding mandate for the operations of military forces,
questions arise as to whether the military should be expected
to adhere to the same guidelines as civilian organizations in
the use and remediation of RDX. A strong majority of par-
ticipants in the public forum expressed strong agreement
before and after deliberation with the following statement:
"The military should be subject to the same environmental
laws as nonmilitary sectors" (Table 9). In the preevent sur-
vey, 84.6% of participants agreed or strongly agreed with
this statement compared with 86.9% in the postevent survey.
The survey also contained four items to measure overall
dispositions toward the military. Responses to these items
confirm that the group was not clearly antimilitary, but rather
reflected a range of different perspectives on this topic.
These four survey items were designed to test responses
against increasingly higher levels of military mandate and
intervention. The first item measured support for the military
in a relatively noncontroversial role: "The military has an
important role to play in peacekeeping." The second item
measured support for the military with respect to its role in
providing national security: "The military has an important
role to play in protecting Canada and its citizens from poten-
tial threats." The third item measured willingness to have
Canada participate in potentially dangerous international
military campaigns: "It is sometimes necessary to put
Canadian soldiers at risk for the sake of international
security." The last item measured support for involving the
Canadian military in a more controversial international role:
"The military has an important role to play in policing the
rest of the world."

As expected, support for each of these statements declined
as the proposed level of intervention of the military increased
(see Figures 1 and 2 for pre- and postdeliberation responses,
respectively; the numbers 1-4 on the x-axis represent the four
different levels of military intervention). That is, progres-
sively controversial roles for the military found progres-
sively lower support from participants. Importantly,
responses to all four items demonstrated a range of opinions,
indicating a good balance of attitudes toward the military in
the sample of participants. Based on these results, it is clear
that the RDX Talk participants were not characterized by
unusually strong antimilitary sentiment. To the contrary, a
majority expressed agreement that the military has important
roles to play domestically and internationally. One might
speculate here that the focus on antiterrorism in at least one
of the forum's recommendations could be associated with an
increase in positive attitudes toward the role of the military,
and therefore tolerance of military authority or autonomy. In
summary, however, in spite of the group demonstrating sup-
port for the military in various roles, there is a clear state-
ment from this group, both in the deliberative conclusions as
well as in the pre- and postsurvey responses, that the military
should be subject to the same environmental regulations as
civilian users of RDX.
Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation
One conclusion of the forum was that regulations regarding
RDX use should be clear and comprehensive, and clearly
recognize RDX as dangerous material. A survey item that
relates to this issue asked participants to respond to the state-
ment: "New regulations are needed to reduce the use of
RDX in Canada." Table 10 shows that 69.2% of participants
agreed or strongly agreed with this statement in the predelib-
eration survey compared with only 3.9% who disagreed or
strongly disagreed. At this time, over a quarter of partici-
pants gave a "don't know" response to this statement.
In the postdeliberation survey, the percentage of those in
agreement with this statement was somewhat lower at 65.2%.
In the postdeliberation survey, there were also far fewer "don't
know" responses to this item, with a strong increase in dis-
agreement with the statement. This suggests that deliberation
had some impact in helping participants form opinions on this
issue and that the group was more divided on the issue after
the deliberation. Nevertheless, a majority of participants indi-
cated support for introducing new regulations to reduce the
use of RDX in Canada before and after deliberating this topic.
Additional Characteristics of the Sample
Selection of individuals for participation in RDX Talk was
geared mainly toward representing diversity across certain
demographic filters. Although the purpose was to represent
a diversity of values, opinions, backgrounds, and interests,
difficulties in assessing these characteristics in the recruit-
ment phase generally mean that demographic variables need
to be used as proxies. However, responses to some survey
items allow us to gain a more nuanced understanding of our
sample of deliberants. Below, we briefly consider partici-
pants' responses to survey items that illustrate diversity in
some important opinions. Variation across the sample from
pre- to postsurvey responses on these items was negligible,
and we consider here only predeliberation responses.
Four (of 26) participants (15.4%) indicated that they had
heard of RDX prior to the event. We infer from this that
while the majority of participants had not heard of RDX, and
therefore reflected the broader population well in this regard,
there were voices present in the deliberation potentially
capable of drawing on broader experiences with RDX.
Seventeen (of 26) participants (65.4%) indicated general
agreement that there are technological solutions to most of
our environmental problems; 6 participants disagreed
(23.1%). We infer from this that the sample was overall
inclined positively toward science and technology, but that a
recognizable minority was potentially opposed to this
position.
To the question whether, in general, environmental prob-
lems can be addressed by experts without input from citi-
zens, only 5 (of 26) respondents agreed (19.2%). Similarly,
for the question of whether RDX pollution, specifically, can
be addressed by experts without input from citizens, 5 (of
26) agreed. Twenty of 26 (76.9%) disagreed with the general
question, and 19 of 26 (73.1%) disagreed with the RDX-
specific question. We infer from this that the majority of par-
ticipants were inclined to feel empowered by their
participation in this deliberation, and felt entitled to hold and
voice an opinion on the issue. Nevertheless, a recognizable
minority likely felt that decisions on the issues discussed in
the forum did not require their input.
Discussion and Conclusion
The problem of RDX pollution and use of emerging tech-
nologies for its remediation reflects a particular example of
societal issues that require governance solutions to be
implemented in conditions of considerable uncertainty.
In developing appropriate public input for these kinds of
problems, it is thus important that such public opinion is

appropriately informed. Both the transcripts of the delibera-
tion as well as the deliberative outputs show evidence that
the individuals who took part in this public deliberation
understood much of the technical information well enough
to formulate meaningful conclusions. This is significant for
a number of reasons. First, it provides further supporting
evidence that lay publics are capable of engaging meaning-
fully in policy debates on issues involving complex science
or technology. Second, although informing a lay public on
matters relating to RDX and bioremediation was not the
primary aim of the project, the legitimacy of the forum's
conclusions arguably relies in part on evidence of at least a
foundational understanding of relevant technical informa-
tion. And third, although many experts tend to lament hav-
ing to work with uninformed publics and cite publics' lack
of technical knowledge as a stumbling block to including
lay publics in policy decision-making processes, the fact is
that most experts themselves constitute a "lay public" in
most areas outside of their own field of specialization. In
the context of the present study, for instance, relevant tech-
nical knowledge came from the areas of microbial genom-
ics, environmental law, remediation of toxic materials, and
environmental science. Experts in any one of these areas are
likely not experts in any of the others. The participants in
RDX Talk, however, were expected to take into account
information from all of these fields, and place them into the
context of even wider public interests, such as considering
the role of the military in contemporary society, considering
long-term costs to the health care system, and how to bal-
ance the issues being discussed in this forum relative to
other societal problems. Given these constraints, the con-
clusions of the public forum reflect breadth of consideration
of issues as well as relatively high awareness of relevant
technical information.
A frequent challenge to the use of mini-publics is that it is
unclear how representative the views of the forum are rela-
tive to the rest of the population. It needs to be acknowl-
edged here that this question of representativeness of views
cannot be answered, because it is the wrong question to ask.
The (post-deliberation) views of the forum are not represen-
tative of the general public, simply because the general pub-
lic has not been exposed to the relevant information on the
subject that was presented to the forum participants, nor have
other members of the public undergone an intense period of
deliberation in which they have been exposed to a range of
different perspectives and had to defend their own positions
against alternative views. In other words, the legitimacy of
the conclusions of this public forum should not rely on crite-
ria of representativeness relative to the broader population,
but on criteria of whether relevant technical information was
understood and taken into account, whether there was undue
bias in the constitution of the group, and whether there is
evidence that the deliberations of the group took into account
a sufficient diversity of perspectives.
The results of RDX Talk allow us to reflect further both
on the substantive issues discussed by members of the public
as well as methodological questions pertaining to conducting
deliberative forums. Regarding the legitimacy of the forum's
conclusions, it can be noted that the diversity of views
expressed over the course of the deliberation suggests that an
appropriately wide range of concerns and perspectives was
considered and incorporated into the conclusions when
deemed relevant. With regard to potential bias, it is possible
that the group was more environmentally minded than aver-
age (given that individuals with an interest in environmental
matters might have been more likely to volunteer for partici-
pation in the project in the first place). However, if this was
the case, the conclusions do not indicate that such a bias
unduly overemphasized environmental over other concerns
(such as human health concerns or considerations of the cur-
rent usefulness of RDX in different sectors). Given that the
military is such a prominent user of RDX, a particularly
salient bias might have been undue pro- or antimilitary senti-
ment. As outlined in the "Method" section, care was taken to
manage potential antimilitary bias in the public forum
through special recruitment filters. The results of the survey
validate that the group was balanced in terms of their senti-
ment toward the military. We have reason to be confident,
therefore, that the conclusions of the forum represent the out-
comes of considered civic deliberation, and not negative (or
positive) sentiment toward the military.
In recent years, the Canadian military has been the subject
of controversy surrounding the issue of trichloroethylene
(TCE), with claims that this solvent, used extensively by the
military, has caused cancer in surrounding communities
(Stephen, 2009). Understandably, decision makers within the
military are cautious about raising public concerns about yet
another potential environmental crisis. The conclusions from
this public forum suggest that an informed public is not likely
to underestimate the difficulties faced by the military in bal-
ancing responsibilities of national defence with those of envi-
ronmentally sustainable practices. Nevertheless, even this
informed public forum (in which care was taken to ensure the
presence of promilitary voices) came to the majority conclu-
sion that the military should not be exempt from the societal
laws governing environmental practices. What we infer from
this is that the military is likely to gain far more favorable
reviews from the public if they conduct their activities relat-
ing to RDX and similarly hazardous substances with a certain
transparency in engaging with public concerns. Although
large-scale attempts of broadcasting problems relating to
RDX and other pollutants are not warranted, attempts to hide
the nature and extent of the problem are likely to result in
increased public outrage should these issues ever be faced
with a high degree of publicity. Although this public forum
was convened to consider the particular case of RDX, one
might cautiously speculate that the forum's conclusions with
regard to not providing special dispensation for military use
O'Doherty et al. 15
of RDX might be generalizable for other pollutants (see also
Santos & Chess, 2003, on citizen Restoration Advisory
Boards consultations with the U.S. Army).
Somewhat independent of the issue of RDX is that of
public responses to microbial genomics and the use of GM
microbes. Given public sentiment on GM crops, GM live-
stock, and GM salmon (Tansey & Burgess, 2008), greater
resistance to the idea of GM microbes might have been
expected in this sample. In contrast to public sentiment on
these other issues, this public forum expressed relatively
low concern with the (hypothetical) use of GM microbes
for bioremediation in their deliberations (even though more
than 50% of the participants did express in the survey that
they felt GM microbes to be "unnatural" organisms). For
reasons outlined above, it is not appropriate to generalize
these views to the general population, but it seems worth
speculating at this point that public perceptions around GM
microbes may be fundamentally different than perceptions
of other GMOs.
Finally, on a methodological note, we argue that the
design feature of allowing deliberants to both set the agenda
for deliberation as well as work toward collective policy rec-
ommendations illustrates an innovative approach to conduct-
ing public deliberation. In particular, we argue that it is an
approach that is particularly well suited to addressing com-
plex and unfamiliar issues like RDX and many other issues
where science and society intersect.
