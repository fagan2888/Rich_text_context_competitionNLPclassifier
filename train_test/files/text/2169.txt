As Roughly 700,000 Prisoners Are
Released Annually, About Half
Will Gain Health Coverage And
Care Under Federal Laws
ABSTRACT During 2009, 730,000 prisoners were released from federal
and state prisons--a 21 percent increase from the number of prisoners
released in 2000. Poor health and poor health coverage have been major
challenges for former prisoners trying to reintegrate into the community
and find work. We discuss these challenges and the likely effect of recent
federal legislation, including the Second Chance Act, the Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and the Affordable Care Act. We
estimated that with the implementation of health reform, up to
33.6 percent of inmates released annually--more than 245,000 people in
2009--could enroll in Medicaid. Similarly, we estimated that up to
23.5 percent of prisoners released annually--more than 172,000 people in
2009--could be eligible for federal tax credits to defray the cost of
purchasing insurance from state health exchanges. This health insurance,
combined with new substance abuse services and patient-centered medical
home models, could dramatically improve the health and success of
former inmates as they return to the community. States should consider
several policy changes to ease prisoners' transitions, including
suspending rather than terminating Medicaid benefits for offenders;
incorporating corrections information into eligibility determination
systems; aiming Medicaid outreach and enrollment efforts at prison
inmates; and designing comprehensive approaches to meeting former
prisoners' health care needs.
Health care planners and reform-
ers should take note: A large
change has occurred in US pris-
ons. The number of prisoners in
the country grew from 330,000
in 1980 to 1.5 million in 2010.1,2 Another 760,000
inmates are in local jails at any one time;2 most
people in jail have received sentences of a year or
less, while most people in prison are serving
longer sentences. But after years of rapid in-
creases and then continued steady growth, the
prison population started to level off in 2008.2
This slowdown reflects both a decrease in the
number of people entering prison and an in-
crease in thenumber of prisoners beingreleased.
During 2009, 730,000 prisoners were released
from federal and state prisons, a 21 percent in-
crease from the number released in 2000.3
The increase in prison releases occurs at a time
when the health care system is expanding insur-
ance coverage and designing new forms of
accountable health care. What are the implica-
tions of these changes for prisoners who are
returning to the community and for their health
insurance?
First, most jail and prison inmates are in rel-
atively poor health. They have high rates of many
chronic medical conditions, mental health dis-

orders, and substance abuse disorders.4 Their
rates of hypertension, asthma, and arthritis
are higher than those of the general population
even after controlling for race, education, and
other socioeconomic differences.5,6 Rates of in-
fectious disease are also high among inmates:
Approximately 18 percent of them have current
or chronic hepatitis C; just over 7 percent have
tested positive for TB; and about 1.5 percent have
HIV/AIDS.7,8
On release, inmates experience very high mor-
tality rates from drug overdoses, cardiovascular
disease, homicide, and suicide.6 This creates a
public health imperative to treat former inmates,
both to prevent the spread of disease and to re-
duce harm, which can include crime and family
violence that arises from substance abuse.
Second, people leaving correctional facilities
are less likely than others to have insurance cov-
erage. In general, men of working age have high
rates of uninsurance. The health status and
constrained employment prospects that often
characterize offenders after release further
complicate their prospects of obtaining health
insurance.
Addressing health insurance access for offend-
ers returning to the community is a priority be-
cause of their high rates of chronic conditions
and infectious disease. In addition, research has
found that having health insurance after release
may be associated with lower rates of rearrest
and drug use,9 making the issue relevant not
only to health officials but also to correctional
officials.
It should be noted that the impact of former
prisoners' reentry into society will not be felt
equally across states. States differ markedly both
in the percentage of their population in prison
and in how that percentage is changing. In 2009
California had the greatest net decline in state
prison population in the country--with 4,300
fewer prisoners than in 2008--followed by Mich-
igan, New York, Maryland, Texas, and Missis-
sippi.10 In twenty-four other states the state
prison population grew in 2009, including gains
of 5 percent or more in Vermont, West Virginia,
and Indiana.
These changes reflect state policies about ad-
mission and release, including parole violation
rules, changes in sentence length and probation
terms, diversion programs (that is, alternatives
to usual criminal justice processing such as drug
treatment or restitution for eligible offenders)
and reentry planning, and court orders regard-
ing prison overcrowding.
Unlike the number of state prisoners, the
number of federal prisoners did not decline in
2009. This reality probably reflects stricter sen-
tencing provisions, more restrictive probation
and parole policies, and fewer diversion oppor-
tunities in the federal system, compared to state
systems. This paper provides an overview of
health insurance and the challenges in securing
coverage for offenders returning to the commu-
nity. It then addresses the effects of legislation
passed since 2006. We provide estimates of the
Affordable Care Act's likely effects on offenders
reentering the community.
Former Inmates' Access To Health
Insurance
Obtaining health insurance can present a
challenge for former inmates. On reentering
the community, they may need time to find
housing and jobs. If the work they get is
part time, temporary, or low-paying, employer-
based health coverage may not be available or
affordable.
Medicaid is another important source of
health insurance coverage. In forty states, dis-
abled individuals who receive Supplemental
Security Income also receive Medicaid. In eight
states, poor childless adults are eligible for
Medicaid or Medicaid-like programs even if they
do not qualify for Supplemental Security In-
come.11 Medicaid covers extensive mental health
services and services--such as intensive case
management, rehabilitation, and support ser-
vices. However, coverage for substance abuse
treatment is frequently limited in amount and
by type of provider.11
Medicaid enrollment and renewal procedures
impose documentation requirements that seem
almost insurmountable for some former in-
mates. Some inmates who had Medicaid cover-
age before incarceration may miss renewal re-
quirements during their prison term. Others
will no longer have the necessary identification
to enroll because identification documents may
have expired or been lost.
Supplemental Security Income Specific
rules about Supplemental Security Income and
inmates pose additional challenges. First, a per-
son who is in jail or a halfway house under the
auspices of a department of corrections is not
eligible for these benefits.
Second, the Social Security Administration re-
quires people with outstanding felony arrest
warrants to respond to those warrants before
applying for or resuming Supplemental Security
Income benefits. This causes particular difficul-
ties for people who are homeless. Many of them
have been arrested for minor charges such as
trespassing and loitering, have failed to appear
for hearings, and as a result had "bench
warrants"--often classified as felony warrants--
issued for their arrest.12 Recently, however, the

Social Security Administration announced that
it will relax this policy, making it less likely that
people will be denied Supplemental Security In-
come benefits and, therefore, denied Medicaid
coverage.13,14
Third, violators of parole or probation must
satisfy their parole or probation conditions or
face suspension of their Supplemental Security
Income benefits.
In practice, jail sentences can be so short that
they do not trigger changes in the inmate's eli-
gibility for benefits.12 In contrast, a prison sen-
tence usually means that the inmate will lose
Supplemental Security Income benefits. Incar-
ceration for less than a year leads to a "suspen-
sion" rather than a "termination" of benefits.
Under Medicaid administrative rules, states
can follow the rules of the Social Security
Administration with respect to Supplemental
Security Income and suspend Medicaid benefits
as well. Payments for someone whose benefits
were suspended should resume soon after he or
she is released, as long as the Social Security
Administration is informed of the release and
the person submits a relatively simple form with
evidence showing that he or she again meets the
income requirements.15
Disability Status People who are incarcer-
ated for longer than a year and had their benefits
terminated must reestablish the existence of
their disability and eligibility for Supplemental
Security Income. Once Supplemental Security
Income eligibility is established, Medicaid
follows.
Disabling conditions may emerge or become
exacerbated during incarceration. In such cases,
inmates who were not eligible for Supplemental
Security Income when they entered prison may
seek those benefits on release. Supplemental
Security Income applications can take three
months to complete, but special rules apply to
people with severementalillness whocanmake a
case for financial emergency.15 Seeking Supple-
mental SecurityIncome benefits for thefirst time
includes providing extensive documentation of a
qualifying disabling condition. On release, for-
mer prisoners may need to access their prison
medical records to successfully make their dis-
ability case. Obtaining such access can cause de-
lays in the application process for Supplemental
Security Income as well as Medicaid.
Recent Federal Legislation
Three federal laws passed since 2006 are particu-
larly relevant to offenders returning to the com-
munity and seeking health insurance coverage.
They are the Second Chance Act of 2007, the
Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
of 2008, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010.
Second Chance Act UndertheSecond Chance
Act, state, local, and community organizations
received $100 million in 2010 from the federal
government to make former inmates' reintegra-
tion into the community after jail or prison more
successful. These funds also gave the states
an opportunity to examine barriers--statutory,
regulatory, or practical--to delivering health
care to former inmates, including lack of health
insurance. In doing so, communities can ad-
dress, for example, any misalignments between
state and local Medicaid procedures that might
affect how people enroll.16
The Second Chance Act also promotes the use
of community-based correctional facilities--
many of which are private, residential facilities
where prisoners can begin to seek employment
and obtain needed treatment services, giving
them an opportunity to adapt to local conditions
before being formally released. However, if these
community facilities are considered to be under
the control of a department of corrections, their
use could make residents ineligible for Medicaid
coverage, as noted above. Community-based cor-
rectional facilities also include nonresidential
"day reporting" centers where prisoners are re-
quired to meet with case managers.With federal
planning support, states can revisit how these
community alternatives are used to improve
reentry, increase former inmates' employment
opportunities and access to health care services,
and maximize their possibility of Medicaid
eligibility.
Mental Health Parity The Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act addresses the
coverage of mental health and substance abuse
benefits in large-group health insurance plans.
The law does not require plans to offer mental
health benefits. However, if plans do offer men-
tal health and substance use disorder benefits,
these benefits must be on an equivalent basis
with medical and surgical benefits. For example,
both types of coverage must have equivalent co-
payments and deductibles, maximum number of
visits, annual and lifetime dollar limits, and out-
of-network coverage.
Disabling conditions
may emerge or
become exacerbated
during incarceration.

In addition, the law does not affect Medicaid
fee-for-service coverage, although it does apply
to Medicaid managed care plans. The law re-
moves major financial barriers to access for peo-
ple who need mental health or addiction treat-
ment. In the light of high rates of mental health
and substance abuse disorder among offenders,
this is potentially very important to former
inmates.
Affordable Care Act Offenders returning to
the community will be affected by the Affordable
Care Act in several ways: through mandates to
obtain health insurance; through the existence
of insurance exchanges in which low-income
people will be able to receive federal tax credits
to reduce the cost of purchasing mandatory cov-
erage; and through the expansion of Medicaid.
Medicaid expansion is particularly important
for prisoners, who are disproportionately low-
income men. Medicaid will become the primary
source of health insurance for most people
whose income is below 138 percent of the federal
poverty level (133 percent plus 5 percent that the
Affordable Care Act requires states to disregard
when they calculate eligibility), especially child-
less adults. In addition, states will receive a
higher federal matching payment for the popu-
lation that will become newly eligible for Medic-
aid. This enhanced match could provide finan-
cial support to bolster a delivery system that is
currently fragmented and fraught with access
problems. States may also expand Medicaid to
childless adults before 2014, but at regular
federal match rates.
There are no published estimates of the impact
that the Affordable Care Act is likely to have on
people released from prison, either through
Medicaid or private insurance coverage. In this
article we present an analysis that attempts the
first such estimates.
Study Data And Methods
We began with the number of released prisoners
as reported by the federal government.2 Then we
estimated the proportion of those former in-
mates who would be eligible for Medicaid--those
whose annual income was below 138 percent of
the federal poverty level, as explained above.
We also estimated the proportion of released
prisoners eligible for federal tax credits to pur-
chase private health insurance policies through
insurance exchanges--those with annual in-
comes below 400 percent of the federal poverty
level. We did not model how employer coverage
or premiums might change. First, using data
from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in Federal
Correctional Facilities17 and the 2004 Survey
of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities,18 we
identified inmates who had indicated that they
expected to be released within the following
twelve months. Fewer than 1 percent of inmates
who anticipated release were over age sixty-five.
We excluded these older inmates from our
sample.
We then estimated the annual income of the
prisoners expecting to be released. Although the
surveys asked inmates about their monthly in-
come prior to arrest, their responses may suffer
from recall bias. Instead of using those survey
responses, we assigned each inmate the average
income for people with identical age, sex, race,
and education level according to the 2009 Cur-
rent Population Survey.19
We considered reducing this assigned income
because having been an inmate may impose a
"wage penalty" on former prisoners, lowering
their wages. Such a wage penalty could occur
because prisoners did not gain work experience
or lost skills during their incarceration. In the
case of younger offenders, they may not have
accumulated work skills prior to being incarcer-
ated. The wage penalty could also arise because
of the stigma attached to former inmates in the
labor market or because offenders represent a
subset of the population with fewer work skills,
after controlling for education.
The evidence is mixed on whether former pris-
oners suffer a wage penalty when they return to
the workforce. Several studies found that con-
viction has relatively small effects on the wages
of released prisoners.20­22 However, one study
found that people who had been convicted were
less likely to be employed than those who had
not, and that convicted people who were em-
ployed earned lower wages than people who
had not been convicted.23 And other studies
found large effects on income, with decreases
of 10­25 percent for those who served jail or
prison terms.22 Another study found that length
of incarceration had no effect on medium-term
employment and earnings and had a positive

effect on short-term employment, possibly be-
cause of former inmates' experience with work
release programs.24 It also found that prisoners'
employment rate peaks sharply after release and
then steadily declines until it is approximately
the same as it was prior to incarceration.
Because of this uncertainty, we estimated the
proportion of released prisoners eligible for
Medicaid and insurance tax credits if there were
no wage penalty and if there were a wage penalty
of 15 percent (Exhibit 1).
Not all inmates will have resided in the United
States long enough to qualify for Medicaid cover-
age. Because the prisoner survey does not ask
about length of residency, we used the Current
Population Survey19 to estimate the proportion
of low-income male inmates who had been in the
United States for less than five years. We esti-
mated that 7 percent of released prisoners would
not qualify for Medicaid on this basis.
Study Results
The estimated mean income for our sample was
$18,169 for state prisoners and $23,763 for
federal prisoners expecting to be released in
the coming year, assuming no wage penalty
(data not shown). For each inmate, we estimated
income as a percent of the 2009 federal poverty
level, assuming a single-member household.
Based on these analyses, we projected the per-
centage of offenders who were financially eli-
gible for Medicaid, with no wage penalty and
with a 15 percent wage penalty (Exhibit 1).
Not everyone who is eligible for Medicaid is
expected to enroll in the program. Increasing the
"take-up" in Medicaid--the enrollment of indi-
viduals who meet eligibility requirements--has
been a persistent challenge. A recent report as-
sumed that 57 percent of uninsured people who
became eligible for Medicaid would actually
enroll, under a "standard participation scenario"
similartocurrentexperience,andthat75percent
of uninsured people would enroll under an "en-
hanced outreach scenario" with more state and
federal outreach.25 We estimated how many re-
leased prisoners would enroll using take-up
rates of 50 percent and 75 percent (Exhibit 1).
Access To Private Health Insurance
Former inmates and others who are not eligible
for Medicaid can obtain insurance through em-
ployers or through state health insurance ex-
changes authorized by the Affordable Care Act.
We assumed the proportion with employer-
based coverage would be similar to the propor-
tion for other adults of similar age, sex, and
income. Tax credits for coverage purchased
through an exchange will be available to people
with incomes below 400 percent of the federal
poverty level. People who have coverage through
their employer generally will not be eligible for
tax credits, unless the premium exceeds 9.5 per-
cent of income. The amount of tax credit received
will depend on the enrollee's income relative to
the federal poverty level and the cost of local
plans. Based only on income, we estimated that
21.9­23.5 percent of released offenders would
be eligible for a tax credit toward private, non-
employer coverage based on their income
(Exhibit 1).
The Affordable Care Act's mandate requiring
people to obtain health insurance or face a tax
penalty will not apply to people whose incomes
fall below the tax filing threshold ($9,350), or
roughly 80­90 percent of the federal poverty
level. Many former prisoners have low estimated

incomes. We estimated 34.0­39.7 percent of re-
leased inmates would fall into this group and
would therefore be exempt from the mandate
(Exhibit 1). However, most of them would be
eligible for Medicaid, unless they could not meet
residency requirements.
Challenges And Opportunities
Medicaid is important to health care access for
offenders today, and it will become increasingly
important with the continuing implementation
of health care reform. The expansionof Medicaid
under the Affordable Care Act will have a pro-
found impact on nondisabled adults, particu-
larly those who do not live with dependent chil-
dren, because historically this group has not
been covered under Medicaid.We estimated that
as many as 245,000 former inmates will enroll in
Medicaid each year after returning to the com-
munity (Exhibit 1).
This sum is not a large fraction of the new
enrollees that the Affordable Care Act is expected
to bring to Medicaid--a number that the
Congressional Budget Office has pegged at six-
teen million.26 However, people in this group
have high levels of health care need, and their
social situations present complexities with
which health plans may have little experience.
For example, they may have relationships to case
managers and treatment providers who are af-
filiated with the corrections system, in addition
to experiencing fragmented social and family
networks and high mental health and substance
use treatment needs.
Providing insurance coverage is only one step
toward improving the health of former prisoners
and, ultimately, improving their income and
employment prospects. Former prisoners have
traditionally relied on a web of safety-net
providers to meet their complex needs. Several
provisions in the Affordable Care Act promote
new models of care delivery, including patient-
centered medical homes and health homes for
people with chronic conditions. These models
have enormous potential.
To serve former prisoners adequately, medical
homes will need to have strong ties to mental
health and substance abuse treatment providers.
Mental health treatment could help stabilize for-
mer prisoners' reintegration into their families
and the job market, while substance abuse treat-
ment could reduce their risk of committing new
offenses. Ideally, these medical homes will coor-
dinate with corrections and probation officers to
help former prisoners with benefit enrollment,
continuity of treatment from prison to commu-
nity, and understanding probation terms and
court orders.
In addition to expanding coverage, the Afford-
able Care Act contains provisions to simplify
enrollment in health insurance. For example,
Medicaid eligibility for newly eligible adults will
not involve an asset test.However, asset tests will
continue to apply to adults who receive Supple-
mental Security Income and seek Medicaid. A
relatively small percentage of prisoners is likely
to be affected by those tests. The prison inmate
surveys found that fewer than 5 percent of in-
mates reported receiving disability benefits in
the month prior to arrest, although others may
become disabled during their incarceration.
The Affordable Care Act also requires states to
streamline and coordinate enrollment between
Medicaid and the health insurance exchanges. If
an applicant applies for coverage through an
exchange but is eligible for Medicaid, he or
she should be enrolled in Medicaid. Federal as-
sistance is also available to help states design and
implement the necessary enrollment technol-
ogy. These efforts should increase health insur-
ance enrollment and reduce churning--the mov-
ing of people in and out of insurance coverage.
Conclusion
New policies in several areas are worth consid-
ering. First, states should consider suspending
rather than terminating Medicaid benefits for
offenders, if their current data systems permit.
Otherwise, this functionality could be added as
states adapt enrollment procedures and data sys-
tems in anticipation of the health exchanges and
Medicaid expansions.
Second, where possible, corrections data
should be incorporated into eligibility determi-
nation systems. Eligibility is determined based
on vital statistics and employment and income.
Thus, correctional data can provide important
information to determine former inmates' eli-
gibility. Alternatively, corrections staff could
provide key documents to inmates, including
incarceration dates, to make it easier for former
prisoners to obtain identification and provide
Providing insurance
coverage is only one
step toward improving
the health of former
prisoners.

income information.27 Enrollment systems also
should include procedures through which cor-
rectional facilities can communicate release
dates to Medicaid offices.
Third, inmates should be included among the
vulnerable populations that states identify for
Medicaid outreach and enrollment. For exam-
ple, entities within a local department of correc-
tions could be given access to Medicaid enroll-
ment and eligibility data systems. Similar
procedures already exist in some state juvenile
justice systems.28
Fourth, to hasten inmates' access to services
after being released from prison, providers who
treat the offender population in the community
could be identified as "qualified entities" under
Medicaid. As qualified entities, service providers
can determine if a person is temporarily eligible
for Medicaid, pending a final eligibility determi-
nation.
Finally, states can involve representatives of
the corrections, probation, and parole systems
in designing a comprehensive approach to meet-
ing the health care needs of former prisoners.
States could also include the representatives in
training programs for new enrollment and eli-
gibility systems.
States face the practical challenges of expand-
ing health insurance coverage and orchestrating
the reentry into their communities of more than
700,000 former prisoners annually. Taking
steps now to smooth these inmates' transitions
will hasten their enrollment in health plans and
remove financial barriers to their treatment. Fur-
thermore, promoting patient-centered medical
homes that can address returning offenders'
complex health and behavioral health needs
could be beneficial to both public health and
public safety.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS: ALISON EVANS CUELLAR & JEHANZEB CHEEMA
Alison Evans
Cuellar is an
associate professor
in the Department
of Health
Administration and
Policy at George
Mason University.
In this month's Health Affairs,
Alison Evans Cuellar and Jehanzeb
Cheema examine the prospect that,
with the implementation of health
reform, as many as 34 percent of
the roughly 700,000 prisoners
released annually will be eligible
for Medicaid and that 24 percent
could gain coverage using federally
subsidized private health
insurance. Because many of these
people will be in poor health, the
authors recommend that states
consider a number of measures to
help facilitate their enrollment into
insurance plans and to customize
approaches, such as through
patient-centered medical homes, to
meet their health care needs.
Cuellar is an associate professor
in the George Mason University
Department of Health
Administration and Policy, an
adjunct economist at the RAND
Corporation, and a research
associate at the National Bureau of
Economic Research. She is the
chair-elect of AcademyHealth's
Health Economics Interest Group,
a member of the editorial board of
Medical Care Research and Review,
and was an associate member of
the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation Initiative on
Mental Health Policy Research.
Cuellar received a doctorate in
health services and policy analysis,
with a concentration in economics,
from the University of California,
Berkeley, and a master's degree in
business administration from the
University of Texas at Austin.
Jehanzeb Cheema
is a graduate
student in
education at
George Mason
University.
Jehanzeb Cheema is a research
assistant at George Mason
University, with a focus on

was awarded a fellowship from
George Mason's College of
Education and Human
Development.

degree and a doctorate in
economics from the University of
Wisconsin­Milwaukee and expects
to earn a doctorate in education
from George Mason University in
