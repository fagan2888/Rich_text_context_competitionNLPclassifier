Abstract
Objective: To investigate the renoprotective effect of nicardipine in patients with pre-existing
renal insufficiency undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).
Methods: Men with preoperative renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]
<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) were enrolled and randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/kg per min
nicardipine continuous infusion (nicardipine group) or normal saline (control group) during RALRP.
Renal function was determined by eGFR and serum creatinine concentration.
Results: Serum creatinine levels on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 3 were significantly lower
than baseline values in the nicardipine group (n ¼ 50). In the control group (n ¼ 50), eGFR was
significantly higher on POD 3 than baseline, and was significantly higher than baseline on POD 1 and
3 in the nicardipine group. The change in eGFR from baseline to POD 1 was significantly higher in
the nicardipine group than the control group.
Conclusion: Continuous infusion of nicardipine during RALRP improved postoperative renal
function on POD 1 in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency.

(RALRP) limits blood loss, reduces fluid
shift, decreases cardiac workload, lowers the
frequency of complications, and shortens
hospital stay compared with conventional
open surgical methods.1 These features
make RALRP an ideal treatment option
with low risks of morbidity and mortality in
patients with comorbid diseases, including
renal insufficiency.2
Pneumoperitoneum (essential for visual-
ization during RALRP) has several side
effects, including reductions in urine
output, creatinine clearance, glomerular fil-
tration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow,
leading to the aggravation of renal dysfunc-
tion during or immediately after laparo-
scopic surgery.3,4 Rats with impaired kidney
function have been shown to exhibit
increased sensitivity to the deleterious renal
effects of pneumoperitoneum compared
with normal animals.5 The 30 head-down
tilt required for adequate visualization also
results in a pronounced increase in central
venous pressure and may further comprom-
ise renal perfusion and renal function.6 The
calcium channel blocker nicardipine prefer-
entially dilates renal arterioles and
increases GFR,7,8 and we have shown that
continuous infusion of low dose nicardipine
during RALRP attenuates the development
of renal insufficiency in the immediate post-
operative period.9 Patients with preopera-
tive renal insufficiency were excluded from
that study, however.
The aim of this prospective, randomized,
controlled study was to use estimated GFR
(eGFR) to investigate the renoprotective
effect of nicardipine in patients with renal
insufficiency undergoing RALRP.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled male patients with pre-
operative renal insufficiency (eGFR <60 ml/
min per 1.73 m2) who were scheduled to
undergo RALRP between June 2011 and
January 2012 at Yonsei University
Severance Hospital, Seoul, Republic of
Korea. Patients with eGFR !60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 were excluded from the study.
The institutional review board of Yonsei
University Medical Center approved the
study and all subjects provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment.
Study design
Patients were randomly allocated to either
the control or nicardipine groups using a
computer generated randomization method.
According to the double-blind method-
ology, the patients, anaesthesia provider
and the anaesthetist collecting the data
were blinded to the composition of the
study groups. An independent researcher
prepared the syringes containing the study
drug.
Anaesthesia and surgery
On the patient's arrival at the operating
theatre, standard monitoring devices were
applied and a 20 G catheter was inserted into
the radial artery under local anaesthesia to
enable arterial pressure monitoring and
blood sampling. Anaesthesia was induced
using 2 mg/kg propofol i.v. and tracheal
intubation was facilitated using 0.6 mg/kg
rocuronium i.v. The patient's lungs were
mechanically ventilated with 50% oxygen in
air at a tidal volume of 8­10 ml/kg and a
respiratory rate of 8­12 breaths/min to
maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide of
30­37 mmHg throughout surgery.
After induction of anaesthesia, patients in
the nicardipine group received 0.5 mg/kg per
min nicardipine continuous intravenous
infusion, and those in the control group
received the same volume of normal saline
throughout the duration of surgery (until
anaesthesia was reversed). Infusions were
carried out using an OrchestraÕ infusion
428 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
device (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg,
Germany). Anaesthesia was maintained
with 0.1­0.2 mg/kg per min remifentanil
continuous intravenous infusion and 1­3%
sevoflurane. Ringer's lactate solution
and normal saline were infused at a rate of
10 ml/kg per h throughout surgery.
Pneumoperitoneum was induced by
carbon dioxide insufflation (12­15 mmHg)
and patients were positioned in a 30 head-
down tilt. The robotic system (da VinciÕ
Surgical System, Intuitive Surgical Inc.,
Mountain View, CA, USA) was controlled
via telemanipulation by a surgeon at the
master console. Pneumoperitoneum was
released after the removal of the prostate.
Data collection
Intra-abdominal pressure and the duration
of pneumoperitoneum and anaesthesia were
recorded. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate
and central venous pressure were recorded
and arterial blood gas analyses were per-
formed at three time points: prepneumoper-
itoneum (10 min after intubation, before
surgical incision and with the patient in
the neutral position); pneumoperitoneum
(1 h after the induction of pneumoperito-
neum, with the patient in the 30
head-down tilt position); and postpneumo-
peritoneum (20 min after the release of
pneumoperitoneum).
Serum creatinine and haemoglobin were
quantified every day at 06:00 hours, and the
corresponding eGFRs were calculated 1 day
before surgery (baseline) and on postopera-
tive days (POD) 1 and 3. The highest serum
creatinine concentration during the post-
operative hospital stay was recorded.
Postoperative urine output was recorded
for 3 days. Ringer's lactate solution was
infused at 1­2 ml/kg per h during the post-
operative period. Postoperative data were
analysed by an investigator (H.H.) who was
blinded to the composition of the study
groups.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD or n.
Sample size was calculated based on eGFR
SDs from an earlier study.10 It was deter-
mined that 49 patients were required in each
group to give a power of 80% to detect
an eGFR of 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and an
-level of 0.05, using the independent t-test.
Between-group comparisons were made
using 2 test, Fisher's exact test, Student's
t-test, or Mann­Whitney U test, as appro-
priate. Within-group changes in serum cre-
atinine concentration and eGFR were
made using Student's t-test and Bonferroni
correction. Statistical analyses were per-
formed with SPSSÕ version 16.0 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ.
P-values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study enrolled 100 male patients (mean
age 69 Æ 6 years; age range 49­81 years) who
were randomly allocated between the con-
trol and nicardipine groups (n ¼ 50 per
group). Demographic and preoperative clin-
ical data are shown in Table 1 and intra-
operative data are shown in Table 2. There
were no statistically significant between-
group differences in demographic, or pre-
and intra-operative data.
Postoperative data are shown in Table 3.
In the nicardipine group, serum creatinine
concentrations were significantly lower than
baseline at POD 1 and POD 3 (P < 0.05 for
both comparisons), but there were no sig-
nificant postoperative changes in the control
group. There were no significant between-
group differences in serum creatinine con-
centrations at any timepoint, highest serum
creatinine concentration, or the number of
patients with postoperative serum creatinine
>1.4 mg/ml (Table 3).
At POD 1 and POD 3, eGFR was
significantly higher than baseline in the
Huh et al. 429
nicardipine group (P < 0.05 for both com-
parisons; Table 3). In addition, eGFR was
significantly higher on POD 3 compared
with baseline in the control group (P < 0.05;
Table 3). There were no significant between-
group differences in eGFR at any timepoint,
however. The change in eGFR from baseline
to POD 1 was significantly higher in the
nicardipine group than the control group
(P < 0.05).
There were no significant between-group
differences in urine output or change in
haemoglobin concentration (Table 3).
No major postoperative complications
requiring repeat surgery or postoperative
intensive care occurred in either group.
Discussion
Continuous infusion of nicardipine during
RALRP increased postoperative eGFR in
the present study of patients with renal
insufficiency. This increase in eGFR was
significantly different from the control
group at postoperative day 1. Low-dose
nicardipine (0.5 mg/kg per min) appears to
attenuate the deleterious effects of pneumo-
peritoneum and the marked head-down tilt
in the immediate postoperative period after
RALRP.
There is a strong correlation between
eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and post-
operative morbidity and mortality.11
Following open surgical procedures, the
morbidity and mortality of patients with
renal failure reach almost 50% and 4%,
respectively.12 In addition, the immunocom-
promised status of patients with renal failure
increases their risk of wound infections.13
Minimally invasive surgery is rapidly repla-
cing open procedures in many areas of
surgery owing to the advantages it offers
(reduced blood loss, lower incidence of
complications, and shorter hospital stay1),

and the risks of morbidity, mortality and
wound complications decrease significantly
in patients with renal failure who are treated
with RALRP rather than open surgery.13
In spite of the advantages of RALRP,
deleterious effects are associated with the
increase in abdominal pressure that is sec-
ondary to pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoper-
itoneum and the marked head-down tilt are
essential for greater surgical visualization in
RALRP,6,14 but pneumoperitoneum
induces renovascular, caval and renal par-
enchymal compression,15­18 and reduces
renal blood flow and urine output in
animal models.15,16,19 A worsening of renal
function in association with pneumoperito-
neum has also been reported in humans
following laparoscopic procedures.3,4,20,21
Extreme head-down tilting markedly
increases central venous pressure and com-
promises renal perfusion during laparo-
scopic procedures.22,23
There is a lack of consensus regarding the
renoprotective effects of drugs. Low-dose
dopamine has been shown to have a reno-
protective effect during laparoscopic sur-
gery,4 but others report that dopamine
and mannitol do not prevent renal dysfunc-
tion during laparoscopic surgery.24,25

predominantly on the renal afferent arteri-
oles, decreasing total renal vascular resist-
ance and increasing renal blood flow and
GFR.26 During pneumoperitoneum, renal
vasoconstriction increases afferent and effer-
ent arteriolar resistance, thereby decreasing
renal blood flow.27 In patients without renal
insufficiency, continuous infusion of nicar-
dipine (0.5 mg/kg per min) during RALRP
was found to preserve eGFR and attenuate
the development of renal insufficiency in the
immediate postoperative period.9
Diminished renal blood flow during
pneumoperitoneum and its return to
normal flow after deflation have been
shown to lead to ischaemia­reperfusion
injury.28­30 Such ischaemia­reperfusion
injury has been associated with increased
levels of reactive oxygen species in the
kidney,31 where glomeruli are considerably
more sensitive to oxidative injuries than any
other segments of the nephron.32 Elevated
calcium ion levels are a key factor in apop-
tosis and necrosis.33 L-type calcium channel
blockers have been shown to inhibit the cal-
cium ion influx induced by anoxia, resulting
in the inhibition of ischemia­reperfusion-
induced apoptosis.34 Clinically, L-type

calcium channel blockers prevent acute
tubular necrosis and delay the onset of
renal failure.35 Nicardipine, an L-type cal-
cium channel blocker, reduces calcium ion
levels and protects tubular cells from apop-
tosis and necrosis.34,36,37
In the present study, we used the lowest
possible dose of nicardipine (0.5 mg/kg per
min38) in order to avoid possible hypoten-
sion and subsequent renal hypoperfusion.
Although this dose of nicardipine was found
to have beneficial effects in this and our
previous study,9 further investigation of the
optimal nicardipine dosage that maximizes
renoprotection while retaining stable
haemodynamics is required. In addition,
the cryoprotective mechanism of nicardipine
remains to be elucidated.
In conclusion, we found that a continu-
ous infusion of nicardipine at a dose of
0.5 mg/kg per min led to significantly better
postoperative renal function on postopera-
tive day 1 than control in patients with pre-
existing renal insufficiency. Nicardipine may
prevent the aggravation of renal dysfunction
immediately after RALRP.
