ABSTRACT. Context. Residential exposures are rec-
ognized risk factors for asthma, but the relative contri-
bution of specific indoor allergens and their overall
contribution to asthma among older children and adoles-
cents in the United States are unknown.
Objective. To estimate the relative contributions,
population-attributable risks, and costs of residential
risk factors for doctor-diagnosed asthma.
Design. Nationally representative, cross-sectional
survey conducted from 1988 to 1994.
Setting and Participants. A total of 5384 children who
were 6 to 16 years old and participated in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, a survey of
the health and nutritional status of children and adults in
the United States.
Main Outcome Measure. Doctor-diagnosed asthma, as
reported by the parent.
Results. Five hundred three of 5384 children and ad-
olescents (11.4%) had doctor-diagnosed asthma. After ad-
justing for age, gender, race, urban status, region of coun-
try, educational attainment of the head of household, and
poverty, predictors of doctor-diagnosed asthma included
a history of allergy to a pet (odds ratio [OR: 2.4; 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 3.3), presence of a pet in the
household (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1), and immediate
hypersensitivity to dust mite (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.0),
Alternaria (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.8), and cockroach aller-
gens (OR: 1.4; CI: 1.04, 1.9). Family history of atopy (OR:
1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7) and diagnosis of allergic rhinitis (OR:
2.1; CI: 1.1, 3.7) were also predictors for asthma. The
population-attributable risk of having 1 or more residen-
tial exposures associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma
was 44.4% (95% CI: 29­60), or an estimated 2 million
excess cases. The attributable cost of asthma resulting
from residential exposures was $405 million (95% CI:
$264­$547 million) annually.
Conclusions. The elimination of identified residen-
tial exposures, if causally associated with asthma, would
result in a 44% decline in doctor-diagnosed asthma among
older children and adolescents in the United States.

Asthma, estimated to affect over 4 million chil-
dren and adolescents in the United States,
has increased dramatically during the past 2
decades.1­3 Numerous risk factors for childhood
asthma have been identified. Residential exposures,
including indoor allergens, have consistently been
shown to be risk factors for the development or
exacerbation of asthma.4­20 Studies that have impli-
cated certain risk factors for asthma, however, are
often limited by small sample size or a restricted
focus on a specific age group, geographic distribu-
tion, or socioeconomic strata.4,10,17,21 Thus, the rela-
tive contribution of specific allergens or other resi-
dential exposures to asthma for children and
adolescents in the United States is poorly defined.
Moreover, there has not been any attempt to estimate
the overall contribution of indoor allergens or resi-
dential exposures to asthma. To develop a national
strategy to prevent childhood asthma, it is critical to
estimate the contribution of specific risk factors and
the overall contribution of residential exposures to
asthma.
In a previous analysis, we estimated that residen-
tial exposures--including pets in the household, al-
lergy to a pet, exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke, and use of gas stove or oven for heat--ac-
counted for 530 000 excess cases (40%) of doctor-
diagnosed asthma in children 6 years old.20 Risk
factors for asthma in early childhood, however, are
often distinct from those that predict asthma in later
childhood and adolescence.6,9 Moreover, skin testing
was not conducted among children younger than 6
years old in the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) III, so we could not
assess immediate hypersensitivity in the younger
children.
The objective of this study was to estimate the
relative contributions, population-attributable risks,
and costs of residential risk factors, including indoor
allergens, for doctor-diagnosed asthma among a rep-
resentative sample of persons 6 to 16 years old in the
United States.
METHODS
NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, was the source of
data for this study. NHANES III was a cross-sectional, household
survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population that used a
complex, multistage probability-sampling design.
The primary dependent variable in this analysis was doctor-
diagnosed asthma. The definition of asthma used in this study was
based on parent report, as determined by a positive response to
the survey question, "Were you ever told by a doctor that your
child had asthma?"

2 of 7 CONTRIBUTION OF RESIDENTIAL EXPOSURES TO ASTHMA
A review of the literature on the cause of asthma was con-
ducted to identify environmental and residential risk factors for
childhood asthma. We focused on modifiable factors that could be
investigated by using NHANES III. These included housing fea-
tures, such as age of residence, urban or nonurban setting, cotinine
and reported exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, presence
of pets, given up or avoided a pet because of allergies, type of
heating and heating fuel, and use of a gas stove or oven for
heat.4­20
Immediate hypersensitivity to standardized indoor allergens
(cat, dust mite, and German cockroach) was measured by skin test,
using the prick-puncture technique. Standardized outdoor aller-
gens (Bermuda grass, perennial rye, short ragweed, white oak,
Russian thistle, and Alternaria alternata) were also measured by
skin test. We included all indoor allergens and Alternaria in this
analysis. The flare and wheal areas were delineated with a mark-
ing pen 15 minutes after the skin was punctured and the allergens
were applied. Allergen mean wheal diameter was calculated as
the longest diameter of the reaction. We considered a skin test to
be valid if the wheal from the positive control (histamine) was at
least 1 mm larger than that of the negative control wheal.21 A skin
test response was considered positive if the panel was valid and if
the mean wheal diameter of the allergen test was at least 2 mm
larger than that of the negative control wheal.21
We were primarily interested in environmental risk factors, but
we included host and demographic variables to adjust for possible
confounding. These variables include child's age, gender, race,
and history of allergic rhinitis or hay fever. Measures of socioeco-
nomic status, such as poverty income ratio and educational
achievement of the head of household, were also included in the
analyses. Finally, we used parental history of atopy (defined as
history of asthma or allergic rhinitis) as a measure of genetic
predisposition to asthma.
Bivariate analyses were conducted to determine associations
with asthma. Variables found to be associated with asthma based
on 2 and Student's t tests (P  .20) were included in logistic
regression analyses. Variables were also included if previous stud-
ies consistently indicated that they were risk factors for childhood
asthma, including gender, race, age, urban residence, region of
country, poverty income ratio, and education level of the head of
household. Poverty income ratio was computed as a total house-
hold income divided by the poverty threshold for the year of the
interview.22 Logistic regression analysis was conducted with
SUDAAN software to account for the complex, multistaged sam-
pling design of the survey.23 Because asthma was present in 10%
of the sample population, the odds ratio (OR) was modified to
better represent the relative risk.24 Sample weights were used to
produce national estimates by adjusting for the oversampling of
young children and minority groups.
Population-attributable risk was calculated for factors indepen-
dently associated with asthma. Population-attributable risk esti-
mates were derived using Levin's formula:
Population-attributable risk %

prevalence  (relative risk  1)
(prevalence  [relative risk  1]  1)
 100,
where prevalence is the prevalence of the risk factor in the pop-
ulation and relative risk is estimated using the observed OR.25
Population-attributable risk was calculated for each predictor
variable and separately for children having 1 identified residen-
tial exposure.
We used published data on the economic cost of asthma to
estimate the cost attributable to residential factors.26 Direct costs
included clinic and emergency department visits, hospital outpa-
tient services, hospitalization, and medications. Indirect costs in-
cluded loss of work because of school absence and illness days.
We presented costs inflated to 1997 dollars using inflation factors
for each direct and indirect cost category.27 Because there was no
significant difference in health service use for children who had
asthma associated with a residential exposure compared with
those who did not have a residential exposure, we assumed that
health service use was similar for the 2 groups. The cost of resi-
dential asthma was the product of the fraction of cases attributable
to residential exposures and the total cost.
RESULTS
Overall, 503 of the 5384 children (11.4%) surveyed
had doctor-diagnosed asthma (Table 1). This trans-
lates to 4.6 million children or adolescents in the
United States with a history of doctor-diagnosed
asthma.
We identified several residential exposures associ-
ated with childhood asthma after adjusting for po-
tential confounders in a logistic regression analysis
(Table 2). Children who had a history of allergies to
a pet--defined as having ever given away or
avoided pets because of allergies--were 2.4 times
more likely to have doctor-diagnosed asthma (OR:
2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 3.3). Presence of
a pet in the house was also a risk factor for asthma
(OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.1). In contrast, exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke, as measured by either
parent report or serum cotinine, was not associated
with asthma.
Immediate hypersensitivity to allergens was also
associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma. Children
who had positive skin tests to Alternaria (OR: 1.9;
95% CI: 1.3, 2.8), dust mite (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.0),
and cockroach (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.9) were at
increased risk for asthma. An individual who had
positive skin tests to all 3 allergens was 4 times more
likely to have doctor-diagnosed asthma compared
with individuals who were not skin test-positive. An
estimated 1 590 000 of children and adolescents
(4.5%) in the United States have positive skin tests to
all 3 allergens. In contrast, a positive skin test to cat
allergen was not associated with asthma in adjusted
analysis (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.8, 2.2).
Host factors associated with asthma in adjusted
analyses included a parental history of atopy (OR:
1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7). Children who had a history of
allergic rhinitis were 2.4 times more likely to have
doctor-diagnosed asthma (95% CI: 1.1, 3.7; Table 2).
Black children were not at increased risk for having
doctor-diagnosed asthma compared with white chil-
dren (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8, 1.4), but poverty was a risk
factor.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the
robustness of the model. There was no change in
predictors when we examined persons who reported
wheezing in the previous 12 months instead of ever
had doctor-diagnosed asthma. Skin test sensitization
to cat allergen did not reach statistical significance as
a risk factor for asthma when the 2 variables for pets
were removed from the model. Because there was
not an ideal variable for inner-city residence, we
explored various interactions of poverty income ratio
by urban residence, but these interactions did not
achieve statistical significance. Similarly, there was
no association of asthma and central-city residence
for phase I (1988­1991) of NHANES III (the variable
central city was only available in phase I). Other
interactions were examined, including child's history
of allergic rhinitis with skin test sensitization to cat,
dust mite, cockroach, and Alternaria, but none
achieved statistical significance.
Over 330 000 excess cases of childhood asthma
were attributable to having an allergy to a pet (Table
http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/107/6/e98 3 of 7
3). Having a household pet accounted for 900 000
excess cases of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Immediate
hypersensitivity to dust mite allergen accounted for
520 000 excess cases, and immediate hypersensitivity
to cockroach allergen accounted for 375 000 excess
cases. Immediate hypersensitivity to Alternaria--a
fungi generally regarded as an outdoor allergen--
accounted for 600 000 excess cases of asthma.
Next, we estimated the population-attributable
risk of having 1 residential risk factor for doctor-
diagnosed asthma. Of the 4.6 million cases of doctor-
diagnosed asthma in persons 6 to 16 years old, we
estimate that 44.4%, or 2 million (95% CI: 1.3­2.75
million) were attributable to residential exposures. In
contrast, having a parent with a history of atopy--a
surrogate marker for the genetic contribution of asth-
ma--accounted for 750 000 cases (Table 3).
There was no significant difference in health ser-
vices use by residential exposure status. Five percent
of children with a residential risk factor were hospi-

talized in the past 12 months, compared with 6.1% of
children without a recognized residential risk factor
(P  .79). Forty percent of children with a residential
risk factor had 1 emergency department visit or
clinic visit for wheezing in the past 12 months, com-
pared with 32.9% for children without a recognized
residential risk factor (P  .34). We assumed that the
costs of asthma attributable to residential exposures
were proportional to the attributable risk fraction
because there were no differences in health services
use for children with or without an identified resi-
dential exposure.
Next, we calculated the direct and indirect costs of
asthma attributable to residential risk factors. Based
on a population-attributable risk of 44.4%, we esti-
mate that the total cost of asthma attributable to
residential risk factors was $405 million (95% CI:
$264­$547 million) annually in 1997 dollars for chil-
dren and adolescents 6 to 16 years old. If we include
the costs of asthma for children 6 years old,20 the
total cost of asthma attributable to residential risk
factors increases to $807 million annually.
DISCUSSION
The results of these analyses indicate that elimi-
nating exposures to indoor allergens and pets, if they
are indeed causal, could prevent over 2 million
(44.4%) of the 4.6 million cases of doctor-diagnosed
asthma among persons 6 to 16 years old in the
United States. The effect of eliminating these risk
factors would, therefore, have a profound impact on
hospitalization rates, emergency and clinic visits,
costs, school absences, and health and functioning of
children and adolescents.28
Having a household pet or an allergy to a pet
(defined as "given up or avoided a pet because of
allergies") were major risk factors for doctor-diag-
nosed asthma. Pet allergens are risk factors for asth-
ma.4,10,20,29­32 Consistent with our earlier report and
surveys conducted in Europe and the United States,
this present analysis indicates that exposure or aller-
gic reactions to pets were the predominant risk factor
for asthma among children and adolescents.20,29­31
These variables may overestimate the risk of asthma
from pet exposure, however, because the temporal
relationship of these exposures with the onset of
asthma was unknown.33
Immediate hypersensitivity to dust mite and cock-
roach allergens was a major risk factor for doctor-
diagnosed asthma. Numerous studies indicate that
immediate hypersensitivity to indoor allergens is a
risk factor for asthma, but the specific allergen(s)
implicated is often dependent on geography, urban
residence, or socioeconomic status.4,10,17,21 Our find-
ings from a nationally representative survey indicate
that sensitization to dust mite accounted for
520 000 excess cases, whereas sensitization to cock-
roach allergen accounted for 375 000 excess cases.
Sensitization to cat allergen was not a predictor for
asthma. There are at least 2 reasons for this conflict-
ing finding. First, families with a history of asthma or
other allergic conditions may selectively avoid cats.33
Second, the variable "avoid or have allergies to pets"
may be a marker for sensitization to cat allergen, but
we were not able to distinguish between allergic
reactions to cats and dogs for "avoiding or having
allergies to pets."
Immediate hypersensitivity to indoor allergens is
considered to be causally associated with asthma
exacerbations. The Institute of Medicine concluded
that there is sufficient evidence of a causal relation
between exposure to allergens produced by house
dust mites, cockroaches and cats, and exacerbations
of asthma in sensitized individuals.34 They also con-
cluded that there is sufficient evidence of an associ-
ation between exposure to dog allergens and exacer-
bations of asthma in sensitized individuals.34 Still, it
is not entirely certain that eliminating exposure to
indoor allergens will prevent the development of
asthma.
Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a po-
tent risk factor for asthma in early childhood.8,9,11­14,20
In contrast, we found no association of exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke with asthma in older
children and adolescents. We did not, however, have
a measure of maternal smoking--the most consistent
marker for the adverse effects of exposure to envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke.5,9,11,14 Instead, we relied
on serum cotinine levels and reported smoking for
any adult in the household. Thus, these differences

tory of allergic rhinitis in the index child and family
history of atopy. Allergic rhinitis, as measured by a
history of hay fever or nasal eosinophilia, is a risk
factor for the subsequent development of asth-
ma.18,35 Still, it is difficult to disentangle the diagno-
sis of allergic rhinitis as a risk factor for asthma or the
result of environmental exposure that predisposes to
both allergic rhinitis and asthma. Similarly, family
history of atopy may represent shared genes or com-
mon environmental exposures that predispose to
asthma. If susceptible children develop asthma only
if they are exposed to allergens, then our estimates of
the population-attributable risk for such exposures
are low.
Black race was not a risk factor for asthma in this
analysis. Some researchers found that black race was
a risk factor for a higher prevalence of asthma,3,20,36
whereas others reported that it was not a risk fac-
tor.37,38 There are numerous potential confounders to
explain these discrepant findings, such as access to
health services and urban status that were not ade-
quately measured in this survey.37 Additional re-
search to address this complex question is war-
ranted.
CONCLUSION
These results indicate that residential risk factors
account for 44.4% of doctor-diagnosed asthma
among older children and adolescents. Taken to-
gether, these and other data clearly show that asthma
in childhood is inextricably linked with residential
exposures. The elimination of residential risk factors,
if causally associated with asthma, would have a
profound effect on medical costs of asthma and,
more importantly, on the health of children.
