People who inject drugs (PWIDs) are socially marginalized
and suffer a disproportionate burden of illness relative to
nonusers (Cherubin & Sapira, 1993; De Alba, Samet, &
Saitz, 2004; Fischer et al., 2005; Frischer, Goldberg, Rahman,
& Berney, 1997; Single, Robson, Rehm, Xie, & Xi, 1999).
Despite this, PWIDs delay seeking health care and underuse
primary care services (Chan et al., 2004; Chitwood, McBride,
French, & Comerford, 1999; De Alba et al., 2004; Fischer et
al., 2005; French, McGeary, Chitwood, & McCoy, 2000;
McGarry, Stein, Clarke, & Friedmann, 2002). PWIDs can
experience further disadvantage due to poor rapport with
health care providers (HCPs). System-level barriers to rap-
port include unrealistic staff expectations, confidentiality
concerns, and wait times (Drumm et al., 2003; VanderWaal
et al., 2001). The attitudes, knowledge, and experiences of
HCPs are additional challenges (Breitbart, Kaim, &
Rosenfeld, 1999; Carroll, 1995; Clarke, 1993; Ding et al.,
2005). Quality of health care encounters themselves are
influenced by the presence or absence of empathy, listening,
shaming, discrimination, flexibility, and disclosure (Drumm
et al., 2003; Merrill, Rhodes, Deyo, Marlatt, & Bradley,
2002; Regen, Murphy, & Murphy, 2002; Weiss, McCoy,
Kluger, & Finkelstein, 2004).
Rapport development is integral to any clinical interac-
tion, and may be a particularly important element of health
care with marginalized PWIDs. A patient-centered approach
improves satisfaction with care and adherence to medical
recommendations, and fulfills patient expectations better
than physical exams or prescriptions (Bass et al., 1986; Beck,
Daughtridge, & Sloane, 2002; Cegala, 1997; Jackson &
Kroenke, 2001; Little et al., 2001; Nutting, Goodwin, Flocke,
Zyzanski, & Stange, 2003; Pelzang, 2010; Rao, Weinberger,
& Kroenke, 2000; Stewart, 1984). But how is a patient-cen-
tered approach fostered in the context of health services?
Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides a useful perspec-
tive with which to understand how rapport might facilitate
motivation for seeking health services. In particular, this
theory addresses how social events are perceived and how
those perceptions affect motivational processes (Wild &
Enzle, 2002). SDT characterizes motivation to engage in
activities on a continuum, ranging from activities that are
completely initiated and controlled by external social forces,

Patient­Provider Rapport in the Health
Care of People Who Inject Drugs
Ginetta Salvalaggio1, Robert McKim2, Marliss Taylor3,
and T. Cameron Wild1
Abstract
Little research has described determinants and consequences of patient­provider rapport among people who inject
drugs (PWIDs). This mixed-method study (a) qualitatively described facilitators, barriers, and consequences to rapport
development between PWIDs and their health care providers and (b) quantitatively tested the hypothesis that quality of
rapport is associated with positive patterns of service use. Two exploratory focus groups with PWIDs and care providers
were conducted. Subsequently, 89 PWIDs completed a survey interview; of those, eight completed a follow-up qualitative
interview. Qualitative results indicated that rapport is influenced by drug-related behaviors, addiction severity, provider
expertise, patient-centered care, and perceived discrimination and that rapport then influences patient compliance, timing
of care, and criminal activity. Quantitative results indicated that rapport predicted PWID satisfaction with care as well as
frequency and timing of emergency department presentations. Results suggest that PWID­provider rapport has several
unique determinants and is associated with positive health care outcomes.

to activities that are fully self-determined. On this theory, all
people have fundamental psychological needs for autonomy,
relatedness, and competence. Social contexts that support
these elements of self-determination promote interested
engagement in activities and personal growth. Conversely,
when social contexts promote perceptions of being con-
trolled or coerced, intrinsic motivation (i.e., interest and
engagement in activities) is undermined (Deci & Ryan,
2002). SDT suggests that rapport with patients will be maxi-
mized when HCPs support their patients' needs for auton-
omy, competence, and relatedness. However, this theory has
not been applied in many marginalized or cross-cultural
settings, nor has it been investigated in the context of injec-
tion drug use. Consequently, the objectives of the present
study were to (a) describe factors that facilitate or prevent the
development of rapport between PWIDs and their HCPs;
(b) describe how HCP­patient rapport relates to PWIDs'
experiences of health care and subsequent care-seeking
behavior; and (c) test the hypothesis that quality of PWID
rapport with a primary HCP would be associated with posi-
tive patterns of health care use.
Method
Overview
This project was facilitated by an academic­community part-
nership between the University of Alberta and Edmonton,
Canada's Streetworks harm reduction program (Wild et al.,
2003; Wozniak, Prakash, Taylor, & Wild, 2007). Community-
Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles (Macaulay et
al., 2009) guided the development, implementation, interpre-
tation, and dissemination of the research. Streetworks and its
clients provided regular input into the project to ensure it
remained relevant and acceptable to the community.All PWID
data collection sessions took place in private meeting rooms
located within community-based agencies and separate from
health care encounters. The research was also approved by the
University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board.
Three data sources were used: (a) PWID and HCP focus
group interviews provided an initial exploration of how
PWID­HCP rapport is developed and how rapport influences
health care; (b) cross-sectional structured interviews quantita-
tively described associations between PWID­HCP rapport
and administrative health records; and (c) semi-structured
qualitative interviews with a subset of the quantitative sample
further clarified rapport-related themes and quantitative asso-
ciations documented in the other data sources.
Although the development of rapport in a long-term
PWID­HCP relationship was of interest, we anticipated that
many participants would be unattached to a regular HCP and
may access a variety of health services and providers differ-
ently than the general population. Thus, rather than limit our
enquiry to a specific health care setting or discipline, PWIDs
were instead encouraged to discuss care-seeking patterns and
rapport development, drawing on their personal experience
with multiple settings and HCPs. Where setting- or disci-
pline-specific content emerged this was taken into account
during the analysis.
Eligible PWIDs were 18 years or older, English speakers,
injecting drugs within 30 days preceding data collection, and
not participating in treatment within the past month,
Edmonton residents, and not intoxicated or experiencing a
psychiatric emergency. PWID participants received CDN$20
as compensation per session for their time.
Focus Groups
Eight PWIDs, purposively selected because of their exten-
sive experience with the health care system, took part in a
preliminary focus group session intended to identify key
concepts for further exploration during individual inter-
views. To provide a complementary perspective, seven HCPs
with experience caring for PWIDs participated in a separate
focus group session. One researcher moderated each session
using a semi-structured interview protocol, while another
recorded field notes and assisted in clarifying responses.
Both moderators were experienced in group interview set-
tings, extensively reviewed and practiced the interview
guides prior to the sessions, looked for consensus and
explored any perceived disagreement within the group, and
used participant engagement strategies where required.
Questions and probes explored participant expectations of
and experiences with health care, as well as perceived influ-
ences on patient­HCP rapport.
Structured Quantitative Interviews
Due to the difficulty in reaching the PWID population with
traditional sampling means, a non-probability sampling
approach known as chain-referral sampling was used. This
method involves identification and recruitment of a small
number of participants via word of mouth, who then provide
contact information for other potential participants (Erickson,
1979). To minimize bias from specific social networks and
settings within the PWID community, multiple chains were
used for recruitment. A total of 89 participants completed the
quantitative data collection.
Baseline demographic variables obtained during the struc-
tured interview included (a) age, (b) gender, (c) ethnicity, (d)
education, (e) marital status, (f) parental status, (g) legal sta-
tus, (h) housing stability, (i) income, and (j) employment sta-
tus. Drug use data were collected on (a) ease of access to
drugs, (b) duration of use, (c) cessation attempts, (d) income
source for drug acquisition, (e) drug-related expenses, (f) sub-
stances used, (g) overdose risk, (h) experience of withdrawal,
and (i) the Blood-Borne Virus Transmission Risk Assessment
Questionnaire (BBV-TRAQ; Fry & Lintzeris, 2003), a
34-item standardized measure of injecting, sexual, and skin
penetration practices that exhibits good reliability and
Salvalaggio et al. 3
validity (Cronbach's  = .87, test­retest correlation = .84 in
Fry & Lintzeris' sample). Variables specific to health and
health care were also collected, including (a) drug depen-
dence treatment history, (b) self-reported physical health sta-
tus, (c) self-reported mental health status, (d) ability to
identify a regular physician, (e) regular physician knowledge
of drug use, (f) self-reported number of visits to regular and
other physicians, (g) preferred point of health care access,
(h) satisfaction with care, (i) perceived hepatitis C (HCV)
risk, and (j) perceived HIV risk.
The Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ) mea-
sured PWID­HCP rapport. Derived from SDT, the short
form of the HCCQ is a validated six-item questionnaire
assessing perceived autonomy support by physicians (Deci,
Eghrari, Patrick, & Leone, 1994; University of Rochester
Psychology Departments, 2006; Williams, Gagne, Ryan, &
Deci, 2002) including items such as "I feel that my doctor
has provided me choices and options" and "My doctor listens
to how I would like to do things." Internal consistency for the
six-item scale was excellent ( = .93).
Alberta Health Care Unique Identifiers (UIs) were col-
lected from consenting participants to link study data to
health service use data. Research assistants noted that almost
all participants consented in principle; however, not all par-
ticipants were able to supply their UI to study staff within
the allotted time period (1 month post-questionnaire).
Among the participants who provided their UI (n = 42), ser-
vice use was assessed in the year immediately preceding
data collection, and included number of emergency depart-
ment (ED) visits, ED visit date and time, and mode of trans-
portation to ED. Frequent ED visits, late night care-seeking
(night shift presentation to services), and transportation via
ambulance (EMS) were measured to assess delayed care-
seeking and lower continuity with a single-care provider
(Brown & Goel, 1994).
Follow-Up Interviews
To clarify and confirm the focus group and quantitative find-
ings, eight PWIDs were purposively recruited from the quan-
titative sample for a follow-up interview. Eligible participants
exhibited divergent scores on the quantitative measure of
rapport (HCCQ), satisfaction with care, identification of a
regular physician, and ED use to ensure a comprehensive
exploration of the patient experience. Participants provided
narratives on their health care experiences, and were probed
on issues brought up in earlier data collection sessions such
as the locations of care, the difference between health profes-
sions, negotiation strategies, the central role of drugs, the
impact of disclosure of drug use on quality of health service
encounters, and the relationship between rapport and satis-
faction with care. Participant recruitment ended after eight
interviews because later interviews confirmed the emerging
themes and did not uncover new or alternate themes.
Participant Characteristics
Limited demographics were collected for PWID focus group
and qualitative interview respondents. Both qualitative par-
ticipant groups were similar to the PWID quantitative sample
as well as the quantitative subsample and administrative
health data were available for both (Tables 1 and 2). PWID
participants were predominantly male, single, unemployed,
unstably housed, and living in poverty. Approximately half
were Caucasian and half had a high school education.
Consistent with other local data sources, the majority of par-
ticipants were poly-substance users as opposed to users of a
single drug or drug class. For the HCP focus group, partici-
pants were seven nurses, physicians, and a mental health
counselor, ranging from 32 to 56 years of age, with 9 to
30 years' health care experience, and reporting 5 to 100
encounters with PWIDs a week. The participants were pre-
dominantly female and community-based; however, hospi-
tal-based professionals were also present.
Qualitative Analysis
Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, tran-
scribed verbatim, and verified for accuracy. Analyses of
these data used a combination of thematic analysis (Boyatzis,
1998) and paraphrasing (Wozniak et al., 2007). Thematic
analysis can be applied by researchers from a variety of epis-
temologies, and thus, facilitate the communication of find-
ings to a wider audience (Boyatzis, 1998). This pragmatic
analytic approach (Figure 1) is particularly well suited to
CBPR and has been successfully used with this target popu-
lation in previous research (Wozniak et al., 2007). Initially,
within-transcript analyses identified meaning units (i.e., sen-
tences, paragraphs) expressing single and idiosyncratic top-
ics by participants.Adescriptive label and verbatim examples
were written and defined for each meaning unit. Next, mean-
ing units were compared across focus group members and
individual interview transcripts to identify constituents (i.e.,
meaning units shared by two or more participants; Wild &
Kuiken, 1992; Wozniak et al., 2007). This procedure allowed
us to identify commonly shared meaning units across the

sample, as opposed to idiosyncratic comments. Constituents
were compiled and a thematic label and verbatim excerpts
were produced. Transcripts and field notes were then reread
to ensure that themes and constituents identified during anal-
yses were consistent with the interview content. NVivo ana-
lytic software facilitated the organization of meaning units
and emerging themes.
Trustworthiness of our analysis was assessed in four
ways: (a) a second researcher reviewed all data analysis and
independently coded two transcripts; (b) focus group partici-
pants reviewed thematic labels and constituents and provided
feedback; (c) follow-up interview sessions continued,
actively seeking alternative interpretations and experiences,
until data saturation occurred and no further themes emerged
(Kuzel, 1999); and (d) a Streetworks staff member reviewed
thematic labels and constituents to ensure consistency with
her observations of the local PWID scene.
Quantitative Analysis
Initially, we identified participants with a regular physician
to determine a subgroup who had the opportunity to establish
rapport with a primary HCP for a longer term. Student t tests
and chi-square tests examined associations between the pres-
ence/absence of a regular physician and PWID characteris-
tics that may have been influenced by this patient­HCP
relationship (current legal involvement, quit attempts, with-
drawal episodes, drug acquisition via crime, overdose risk,
and infectious disease risk behavior). Next, Pearson correla-
tions were calculated among participants who reported that
they had a regular physician to determine associations
between rapport (HCCQ scores) and three main service use
outcomes chosen to reflect the quality and consistency with
which participants experience a therapeutic relationship with
their primary HCP: (a) disclosure of drug use (yes or no),
(b) ED visits, and (c) satisfaction with care. Additional
Pearson correlations were calculated for other available
health care measures assessing self-reported health status,
consistency of HCP, and acuity of presentation. Finally, hier-
archical multiple regression was performed to determine
whether rapport incrementally improved prediction of the
primary service use variables, adjusting for effects of demo-
graphic covariates and PWID risk behaviors.
Results
Focus Groups
Participants'accounts of the determinants of rapport included
patient, HCP, external, and encounter-based factors.
Patient factors.Participants acknowledged that the patient
contributed greatly to the development of patient­HCP rap-
port. For example, respondents stated that the nature of drug
dependence and withdrawal is such that it exerts an inescap-
able influence on the PWID's behavior during health care
encounters. Participants stressed that drug dependence is an
illness with potentially severe interpersonal and other conse-
quences, over which drug dependence PWIDs had little
control:
I mean it's like you had a choice at one point but that line's been
crossed a long time ago. I mean, you can have like 50 doctors
say no. It doesn't change the fact that you have to like you have
to do what's required. I mean like you rob a drug store, rob
another store or person or something to buy drugs with. And

PWID health care encounters were often described as fun-
damentally social, rather than medical, in nature. Participants
acknowledged that, given the nature of drug dependence,
caring for PWIDs is not a straightforward task.
I mean there's no question that some of my hardest interactions
are with someone where it is mental health and addictions the
complexity sometimes can feel overwhelming. And certainly
I'm no master of any of it. So I feel at a loss sometimes of what
to do, or how to help. (PFG4, 416)
Care avoidance was another barrier to effective rapport
for many participants and was usually attributed to past
experiences with health care. PWIDs related several past epi-
sodes of poor treatment by HCPs. These experiences led
patients to delay, refuse, and prematurely terminate health
care encounters, compromising the establishment of good
rapport with HCPs. In addition, HCPs were keenly aware
that typical wait times for those patients dealing with drug
withdrawal and street life were unrealistic, and were pre-
pared for crisis presentations as a result:
People can't wait 3 or 4 hours. Or they'll come in the morning
and by the afternoon, something, things will have completely
fallen apart, that sort of thing. It really frustrates me to see
people come in--in crisis. (PFG6, 847)
HCP factors. HCP focus group participants emphasized that
their pre-encounter attitudes, experience, and position of
power had major impacts on the rapport achieved during
PWID­HCP encounters. Seasoned HCPs expected patient
hostility but accepted that it often had a legitimate, remedia-
ble cause:
I think sometimes people just come in feeling judged from the
minute they get there and probably with great justification. And
they come in and have been judged before and they're kinda
scared to tell you anything or openly hostile when they first
come in. (PFG5, 280)
Recognizing their role in establishing healthy relation-
ships, HCP participants exercised self-reflection after their
PWID encounters. Participants accepted responsibility for
their role in the encounter:
It's if I don't have that connection--they don't come back? Then
there was something wrong and I often sort of try to figure out
what the heck happened here and what did I do wrong. Because
those are the ones that bug me . . . (PFG4, 246)
PWID participants also remarked that HCP knowledge
about illnesses associated with street life and drug depen-
dence was a great asset to good patient care:
I think they're um, better at the clinic too because they are more
used to having drug users around and they're used to seeing the
same people and pretty well know how their habits are. (IFG8, 376)

Within-encounter factors.Participants in both focus groups
devoted most of their discussion of rapport to the content and
quality of the PWID­HCP interaction itself. Discrimination
against PWIDs and associated trivialization of PWID con-
cerns was a very common rapport-damaging experience.
I think the doctors there think you're coming in there for drugs,
even if it's a legitimate reason. Like if you have an abscess or
something like that. They'll let you wait still. "Oh you're an IV
user. You can wait a while, you left it this long, it's not a big thing"
. . . Ya yup you're the last stick on the totem pole. (IFG1, 383)
In contrast, rapport was strengthened by the basic princi-
ples of patient-centered care, such as time, listening, con-
cern, confidentiality, and partnership. HCPs took the time to
find common ground with their patients and share control of
the encounter where possible:
I guess I expect at times sometimes a little bit of initial resistance
but then I expect at the end that we will have a plan that I think
will work for both parties. (PFG2, 65)
Developing trust and honesty in a PWID­HCP relationship
is both complex and gradual. PWIDs acknowledged that hon-
esty can strengthen rapport, but it can also have drawbacks:
I mean my problem is I have lie to a psychiatrist. Like thing is
every single thing wrong with me to them is from drug use. I
mean like every hallucination, every illness in my body is simply
because you're an IV drug user this and that. So I have to sit
there and kiss ass and lie to them and if I am having trouble I
can't tell them that. (IFG4, 332)
HCPs understood that it takes time to develop this open
relationship, and focused their early rapport-building efforts
on remaining authentic, available, and attuned to their
patients' context. They were comfortable accepting as much
honesty as was possible for the PWID:
I expect as much honesty as they are capable of giving in the
context. So that I can help them . . . My other expectation when
dealing with IV users, [is] of myself. I expect myself to be as
open and as approachable as I can be. So expectations of
openness on both parts I guess . . . (PFG6, 99)
HCPs used several culturally sensitive strategies to build
this relationship, from humor to harm reduction counseling
to asking patients about their context:
One of my tricks is if someone says something that I don't
understand, I'll say, "Hang on, what's that, what does that
mean?" And that's a very powerful way of creating a rapport.
(PFG6, 333)
In all health care encounters, a negotiation process
between the patient and the HCP occurs, and this negotiation
has an impact on rapport and subsequent care-seeking behav-
ior. Where the recipient of care is a PWID, the nature of the
negotiation has additional unique characteristics. PWIDs
focused on the need to navigate HCP-centric rules and create
a legitimate argument for their health care requests:
My father-in-law had passed away, I wanted to go to the funeral
you know my kids wanted me there and that. And I couldn't get
a carry. I couldn't go to the funeral . . . There's a lot of bull of
having to get your pills every day. I've been getting them every
day for the last year now. And it just I find like if I could get it
even like every twice a week. Once a week. I would be a lot
better off. I could take off for a few days. Go out of town, I could
go up [north], see my kids. The way it is now, I have to be at the
pharmacy. (IFG2, 599)
Given the challenges associated with drug-related PWID­
HCP negotiation, consistency in a HCP's application of rules
was reassuring to participants:
The clinic, the best thing about the clinic is the consistency. I
mean, even though sometimes you might not like the answer
you get, I mean, the staff treats you. It's like, basically equals
respect type thing. Like as long as you're like honest and like,
fair with the staff, they're helpful. (IFG4, 389)
Conversely, inconsistent HCP practices are frustrating to
patients:
The bad thing is when one doctor. It's almost if one doctor writes
five of your friend's prescription and you go to see the same
doctor and he basically shoots you down cold. (IFG4, 764)
HCP participants described the emotion-laden nature of
PWID encounters as well as their strategies for dealing with
these emotions. Strong reactions to a patient can interfere
with one's ability to help that patient. When participants
explained their actions and remained calm, their patients
usually responded in the same way:
I know it sounds a bit odd but you tell yourself that you're
comfortable and you're casual and that actually you see people,
the other person calms down. That's speaking slowly and softly.
Great trick for calming down in a situation like that `cause
people are often not necessarily hostile but still agitated, worried,
you know. (PFG6, 338)
External factors.Participants in both groups alluded to cer-
tain system-level rapport builders and breakers. HCPs were
frustrated in their attempts to comprehensively address drug
dependence and social issues by the system's time, space,
and resource constraints:
Because it's not designed to help people who are marginalized.
The system isn't set up to take care of these people while they're
in hospital and deal with the big picture. I'm sure she wasn't
getting enough pain medicine or enough drugs in hospital and
she just said, "Screw you guys, I feel better, I've got other
needs" and we're not addressing those other needs. When we
have them there, when we have the opportunity to do it. Not that
Salvalaggio et al. 7
we can fix everything but I think we have to at least make sure
those things are addressed so they don't feel like they have no
other options but to leave. (PFG2, 654)
PWIDs mirrored this frustration with the health care sys-
tem, citing bureaucratic barriers and wait times with inade-
quate communication to help cope with these barriers:
It's just until you put these little hoops and stuff and on top of it
you are usually the 50th person to be seen. And you go into
emergency and there will be 200 people in the waiting room and
its daytime already and you've watched the whole waiting room
empty twice. And they bring you in and they don't even do
anything. (IFG4, 696)
Other health care team members also influenced rapport;
a negative encounter with one team member can damage the
rapport built by others:
Well, we'll have people though that everything will being going
well, everything's great, they're being admitted and all this stuff.
And then all of a sudden the next thing you see them slamming
at the door and they're angry. And they go through so many
people, the nurses, the doctors, right down to the porters and one
person they will have a really negative interaction with
somebody where they feel judged. (PFG5, 794)
Quantitative Associations Between Rapport and
Service Use
Comparisons between PWIDs who reported having access to
a regular physician (as opposed to not having such access)
indicated that physician accessibility was associated with
lower criminal involvement (39% vs. 65%), 2(1) = 4.61,
p < .05; less reliance on criminal activity for drug acquisition
(53% vs. 83%), 2(1) = 6.79, p < .01; more attempts at cessa-
tion of drug use (four vs. two injection-free periods, t
81
=
2.50, p < .05), and less frequent experience of drug with-
drawal (22% vs. 53%), 2(1) = 6.82, p < .01 (Table 3).
In the subgroup of PWIDs reporting regular access to a
physician, rapport was associated with satisfaction with
health care (r = .58, p < .0001; Table 4); this association
remained significant after adjusting for socio-demographic

ary outcomes, including decreased night shift presentation
(rho = -0.23, p < .05) and decreased EMS transportation to
the ED (rho = -0.21, p = .056; Table 6). Although rapport
was only marginally associated with disclosure of drug use
(50% vs. 27.3%), 2(1) = 3.06, p < .08, and not with overall
ED use, the latter two were associated with each other, that
is, nondisclosure of drug use was associated with more ED
use (rho = -0.36, p < .05; Table 4).
Follow-Up Qualitative Interviews
Interview participants confirmed many of the themes which
surfaced during the earlier focus group sessions about the pre-
existing patient and HCP factors, the external context, and the
encounter-based factors, which contributed to PWID­HCP
rapport. Participants stressed the importance of HCPs acknowl-
edging that drug dependence is a complex illness. They also
noted that people living with drug dependence tended to behave
in ways that shaped the HCP's expectations:
Well it's so hard you know `cause you, you know, you're abusive,
you're loud . . . you just walked 30, 40 blocks, three or four
different places probably and finally you get to this point and at
some point you're trying to get to see him to help you out you
know and so they go you know they interrogate you and you know
"You're double doctoring" you're this or you're that. (I3, 343)
Drug dependence not only affects the behavior and over-
all health of PWIDs, it also changes users' priorities. Drugs
play a central role in active users' lives, and all other pur-
suits, including health care, take a back seat until the need for
drugs is met.
You don't got no dope after a while, how you gonna get more
dope so you gotta do other things to get more dope. Right? And
then you gotta do crime or you go to work or whatever you gotta
do right, it's a habit. (I5, 110)
Focus group themes of HCP familiarity, values, attitudes,
experience, and expertise were equally brought up in the
individual interviews as being key HCP attributes necessary
for rapport. Many participants were grateful when they had
HCP continuity. Participants were much more comfortable
with a HCP who showed expertise in drug dependence, drug-
related injury, pain management, and other conditions com-
monly experienced by street-involved people.
I've shopped around a lot to find the right doctor and finding a
doctor who is knowledgeable about the street illnesses, you
know, there's no point in me going to see a doctor who deals
with the upper echelon, you know, with their illness because
those aren't the illnesses I get and they understand it, and they
see more patients like myself with the same background so they
don't have the bias. (I1, 49)
As for influences at the level of the Canadian health care
system, participants confirmed that bureaucracy, legisla-
tion, and health care teams exerted an important influence
on rapport. Though participants usually wanted to see a
doctor as part of their visit, they often interacted with
nurses, counselors, reception staff, security, and ambulance
personnel first. Physicians function within this team setting
and their decisions are under the influence of these team
members. Having valid identification to access public
health care was not a given. Furthermore, participants felt
that HCPs were unconcerned that their patients' medical
conditions were not addressed more expediently:
You set an appointment and you wait and wait for months down
the road to go to see the doctor and they lost your paperwork or
"I don't know where it could be, try again next week." You
know? And I just waited 3 weeks or 4 weeks, they don't care,
they don't understand that, there's no compassion. (I3, 395)
Regardless of whether participants had a regular HCP or
where they accessed health services, most participants
alluded to frustrating wait times. The longer the participants
waited, the more sick from withdrawal and belligerent they
often became, further damaging their opportunity to estab-
lish rapport. Participants were upset that the unpleasantness
of withdrawal and pain, though not life-threatening, were not
treated with the same priority as other medical conditions:
You go into the emergency and you've got an OD or you've
done too much of something you sit and wait there for 4, 5,
6 hours before anybody sees you and you see people that come
in after you getting treatment while you're sitting there and if
you raise a ruckus then the security runs you out. (I1, 55)
Similar to our focus group results, individual interviews
gravitated overwhelmingly to a discussion of the PWID­HCP
Salvalaggio et al. 9
interaction itself during health care encounters. Non-
discrimination and patient-centered care were confirmed by
all participants to be key determinants of effective rapport.
The HCP use of humor and harm reduction helped to make
communication appropriate to the PWID context:
I4: He started laughing and said "why not?"
M: [Laughter]
I4: He just jokes around stuff.
M: Ya?
I4: Ya, he's pretty good ya. (117)
Participants were more satisfied with visits during which
they were treated as equals worthy of the same dignity as
HCPs themselves:
I go in to see my family doctor, when he comes through the door
he's got a smile on his face "How you doing [Bob]?" You go in
through the emergency, it's "What's the problem?" it's not a
person thing it's an object thing. (I1, 91)
Negotiation tactics. Patient­HCP interaction in the context of
injection drug use is unique in that drug dependence plays a
central role. Disclosure of drug use has several rapport-
related consequences and PWIDs need to decide to what
extent they can be honest with HCPs. The need for patients
to obtain drug prescriptions often dominates encounters, and
without addressing this issue, the opportunity to further
develop rapport or explore other health care needs may be
lost. It is within this context that HCPs and PWID patients
have set up certain rules of negotiation to ensure that their
respective expectations are satisfied. First, participants could
not perceive a consistent HCP standard for dealing with
patient requests. The specific negotiation strategies used by
participants to procure a prescription, for example, varied
significantly according to the HCP involved. As some par-
ticipants put it, this system or lack of a system essentially
forced patients to "play games" and shop around:
Depending on how much they give you, I mean, or what you
need will probably determine who you're going to go and see.
(I6, 483)
At one end of the spectrum, some HCPs were known for
their blanket refusal to prescribe narcotics, often accompa-
nied by prominent signage at clinic doors. At the same time,
participants described multiple physician practices with a
seemingly greater interest in patient volume than individual
assessment. Many of these practices were known for their
tendency to prescribe narcotics rather easily without first
assessing the patient's actual condition. This perceived lack
of interest on the part of the HCP also impeded rapport devel-
opment. In this unpredictable environment, participants had
learned to read each HCP's behavior and observe their man-
agement patterns for other PWIDs, and present their case in
a fashion consistent with the HCP's usual practice.
As a general rule of negotiation, PWIDs were careful to
disclose only the minimal information necessary to procure
their medication. Disclosure of injection, drug diversion, or
other forms of prescription misuse usually led to abrupt dis-
continuation of existing prescription, and in some cases, ter-
mination of the HCP­patient relationship itself. Participants
also acknowledged that they needed to be honest enough
with their HCP to relate what they needed if they expected to
have their needs addressed. Some disclosure was also neces-
sary to garner a HCP's trust:
If I don't say what I need I'm not going to get it you know like,
but if I [don't] show them what it is and what I need to get it
done to fix it then they really can't really help me right? (I6, 264)
Participants also described having to deal with numerous
HCP-centric rules of negotiation, such as routine questions
about drug use patterns, urine drug screens, restricted drug
amounts and dispensing frequencies, and limited treatment
of chronic pain or issues related to drug dependence (e.g.,
mental health, infectious diseases). They felt that HCPs

abided by such rules, not to maximize patient safety and
well-being or comply with professional standards of care,
but rather to protect themselves. These stringent rules, com-
bined with the HCP's powerful position, ultimately left
many participants feeling like they had very little autonomy
over their health care. Several participants spoke of the des-
peration and punishment inherent to their position in this
power differential, invoking religious, military, and other
metaphors:
I honestly feel like a prisoner of war. (I7, 458)
Faced with these rules, participants had developed vari-
ous counter-tactics to advance their agenda in addition to the
selective disclosure patterns described above. Some partici-
pants believed that it was too difficult to keep track of a con-
structed narrative, and preferred to be straightforward with
their health care requests and hope for an understanding pro-
fessional. Other participants felt that it was best to compro-
mise, if necessary, and meet a HCP's expectations to justify
to the HCP that their own requests were also worthy of being
met:
I2: I just want to be treated with respect, but to be treated
with respect, you've got to earn respect.
M: And how do you earn respect?
I2: Well I think by this time when I go see him and show
him my clean arms and I'll tell him, "Look anywhere
you want, you will see no holes." And I said now you
know "I'm doing what you want doc and I'm not only
doing it for you I'm doing it for me too." (278)
Regardless of the specific negotiation strategies used,
most participants relied on their street-honed instincts to
guide them in their assessment of each health care encounter
and its likely outcome. Though verbal and nonverbal lan-
guage and indirect observations of peer-provider encounters
provided important clues, participants also alluded to a less
tangible "sense" of whether or not things were going well:
You can tell. Just this or this or for example when they say
someone's a racist you can't see it but you can tell so it's the
same notion here. You just can tell if they're a human being, it's
just a certain sense of, you know, a sixth sense of you can tell
who's treating you right or who's not. (I8, 37)
Outcomes of rapport.The quality of the HCP­PWID rela-
tionship leads to varying degrees of trust, patient satisfac-
tion, HCP continuity, criminal activity, and compliance with
recommendations. PWIDs may also decide where to access
health care or whether to access health care at all based on
their interpersonal experiences.
Quantitative associations between PWID­HCP rapport
and patient satisfaction with care were confirmed in follow-
up interviews, with all participants agreeing that a positive
rapport experience made them happier with their encounter.
This association appeared to be moderated by the patient's
prescription expectations, but once prescription needs were
addressed, rapport was an important determinant of overall
satisfaction:
M: Would you say it's associated with feeling more satis-
fied with the visit? More satisfied with your care in
general?
I7: Ya, ya, you feel like you're getting help right from
someone that cares about you. (784)
The influence of location was specifically explored in
individual interviews because no consensus was reached on
its effect during focus groups sessions. It became clear that
location is not a key determinant of rapport, but rather an
outcome of rapport. Participants felt that it was more the
HCPs in a location as opposed to the location itself, which
established good or bad rapport. For example, PWIDs shared
positive experiences with certain HCPs in locations other-
wise perceived as negative:
Well last time I had pneumonia, and I was down for about
2 weeks . . . I stayed there for a night and day, and whatever, and
then they [found me a shelter bed] and slept there for 4 or 5 days
about, they took care of me, they made sure I was warm and they
got rid of my cold, they gave me my medications. (I6, 305)
However, a participant and his peers' negative experi-
ences with one or more HCPs in a given facility shaped the
overall reputation of the facility and influenced their deci-
sion as to whether they would go back, if given a choice:
I8: What's really sad, is the [hospital] has a very bad
reputation.
M: Really?
I8: Extremely bad.
M: Will you avoid going there even if you're close?
I8: Oh ya. Yup.
M: Ok, how come?
I8: Why? Bad experiences. (98)
Some participants believed that HCP unwillingness to
negotiate with patients living with drug dependence set the
stage for drug-related criminal activity, HCP discontinuity
and "doctor shopping."
I don't know, just I guess different days different docs right?
Like I know a lot of people here that do that too right, they
switch doctors, right, all over the city just everywhere, and
there's no really there's no really favoritism, it's just the way
drug dependence is [Inaudible word] it just makes it go here
there and like the . . . (I6, 469)
A HCP's commitment to rapport development also
encouraged some participants to commit to a long-term rela-
tionship and comply with a HCP's recommendations:
Salvalaggio et al. 11
I OD'd and I woke up 3 days later in intensive care . . . and one
of the social workers there came through and asked the right
questions and she got one of the [community health workers] . . .
to come to see me `cause I was suicidal, I wanted to check out.
I'd had enough trying to beat this and . . . she came over 3 days
in a row to see me and just she got me off [to treatment], spent
3 years out there, got my head back together, my life back
together . . . but that was because I was being treated as an
individual. And I felt cared for. (I1, 166)
Discussion
In contrast to the general population, rapport is defined by
PWIDs in a distinctly different way, including such elements
as disclosure, nondiscrimination, and consistency. In keep-
ing with scholarly work on rapport between HCPs and
patients in more general settings, study participants con-
firmed that rapport involves many of the central tenets of the
patient-centered clinical approach, such as HCP­patient
communication, partnership, empathy, and continuity.
Similarly, rapport is fostered when HCPs adopt autonomy
supportive strategies identified in SDT, such as providing
information exchange in a non-controlling way, shared deci-
sion making, and empathy. Whereas HCP-controlled encoun-
ters limit PWIDs' engagement in their care, shared-control
encounters foster such engagement. These findings are con-
sistent with a large body of research using SDT that consis-
tently demonstrates that that autonomy supportive styles
facilitate rapport and engagement in social relationships that
exhibit power differentials (e.g., between managers and
employees or teachers and students; see Deci & Ryan, 2002).
In addition to autonomy support, qualitative interview par-
ticipants also equated rapport with disclosure of drug use to
a HCP; this is, perhaps, a PWID-specific manifestation of
patient-HCP trust. Nondiscrimination is another key con-
cern; perceived bias against PWIDs damages rapport,
whereas the acknowledgment of a PWID's personhood
improves it. Finally, drug dependence holds overwhelming
priority for many PWIDs; failure to address drug use in a
consistent fashion undermines rapport development.
Although the PWID­HCP literature on rapport identifies
many of these influences (Breitbart et al., 1999; Carroll,
1995; Clarke, 1993; Ding et al., 2005; Drumm et al., 2003;
Merrill et al., 2002; Regen et al., 2002; VanderWaal et al.,
2001; Weiss et al., 2004), our results broaden this literature
to provide evidence for the roles of selective disclosure,
proof of legitimacy, and other PWID negotiation strategies
developed as a response to perceived HCP inconsistencies
during health care encounters. These negotiation strategies
are used by highly marginalized individuals whose experi-
ence with powerlessness is entrenched in health care and
social structures and who, ultimately, have no other means to
exert some control over their health care encounters. HCPs
would do well to be mindful of their position of power rela-
tive to PWIDs and encourage greater partnership in decision
making. Furthermore, punitive and abstinence-based
approaches to drug policy may reinforce this power differen-
tial and have the unintended consequence of reducing
PWID's intrinsic motivation to change; pragmatic approaches
to policy, such as harm reduction, may afford a greater sense
of autonomy for PWIDs and be more effective in engaging
people toward better health choices.
PWID­HCP rapport supports positive health experiences,
including trust, satisfaction with care, follow-through with
HCP recommendations, continuity with one HCP, and timely
care-seeking. Conversely, a lack of rapport plays a role in
HCP discontinuity and avoidance of care, and criminal activ-
ity may also be escalated. Participant responses to specific
probes during follow-up interviews suggest that poor rapport
is an upstream influence on these negative outcomes. HCPs
may want to accordingly adopt a broader view of the health
and social impact of rapport for this population, seek out
learning opportunities to better understand the PWID con-
text, and incorporate consistent, relationship-based care as
an important potential form of harm reduction for their
patients who live with drug dependence.
The study findings point to the need for policy develop-
ment regarding good clinical practice in PWID care.
Mandating a clinical practice model in a physician environ-
ment that is built on autonomous practice is difficult. Practice
change is more likely to be a gradual process, whereby the
practice setting is first influenced through translation of
the research findings into practice guidelines and other edu-
cational activities relevant to the clinical context, then pro-
viding incentives for the behavior to evolve into common
clinical practice. This along with integration of best practices
in the care of vulnerable populations at the level of health
professional schools will drive the emergence of patient-cen-
tered PWID care as a common practice in the system.
Limitations
The research described here was exploratory in nature.
Purposive groups with fewer than 10 participants are com-
mon in qualitative research, where the objective is not to
generalize findings to larger populations but rather to deepen
understanding of observed phenomena in a homogeneous
subpopulation (Kuzel, 1999). Though our quantitative sam-
ple was small, quantitative findings were intended primarily
for data source triangulation with qualitative findings. The
use of mixed methods and our results showing that similar
findings were obtained across all samples strengthens the
likelihood that our observations reflect this population's
experience.
Quantitative sampling was nonrandom. Truly random
sampling was impossible with a population known for its
mobility and limited telephone access. Female, younger,
incarcerated, or severely ill individuals were underrepre-
sented in this sample.

Further Study
The association between PWID­HCP rapport and health
care use warrants examination in a larger, prospective cohort
study. New recruitment strategies may need to be used to
determine whether these research findings apply to less
well-connected PWIDs. Knowledge sharing and other
potential solutions to documented rapport-related problems
require additional consultation with PWIDs, front line
HCPs, health promotion experts, and policy makers prior to
implementation.
Conclusion
Multiple patient, HCP, and system characteristics influence
PWID­HCP rapport, including the level of perceived dis-
crimination and autonomy support as well as the success of
negotiation strategies used by both parties to fulfill their
expectations. Drug dependence is a health issue central to the
lives of patients, and it influences HCP and patient behavior.
HCPs and health care policy makers are encouraged to foster
strong, long-term patient­HCP relationships to improve
PWID adherence to HCP recommendations, timing of health
care, HCP continuity, avoidance of criminal activity, and sat-
isfaction with care.
