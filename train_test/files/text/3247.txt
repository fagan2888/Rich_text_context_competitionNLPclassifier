Loss rates on mortgages have increased substantially in the US and many other coun-
tries during the financial crisis. At the same time, financial institutions were heavily
exposed to the mortgage market when the crisis started. As a result, many banks
suffered high losses or even failed. One reason for this was that financial institutions
underestimated the risk associated with mortgages. Another reason for the extent of
the crisis was that also existing banking regulation and capital requirements did not
adequately capture the build-up of risks in the mortgage market and the resulting sys-
temic impact. As a reaction, we see increasing international efforts (especially by the
Financial Stability Board, the BIS and the IMF) to enhance macroprudential instru-
ments in order to identify and monitor systemic risks and to limit the build-up and/or
the impact of these risks.
We develop a theoretical model of mortgage loss rates that evaluates their main
underlying risk factors. Following the model, loss rates are positively influenced by the
house price level, the loan-to-value of mortgages, interest rates, and the unemployment
rate. They are negatively influenced by the growth of house prices and the income
level. The calibration of the model for the US and Switzerland demonstrates that it
is able to describe the overall development of actual mortgage loss rates in sample
as well as out of sample. In addition, we show potential applications of the model for
different macroprudential instruments: the calibration of loss rates under stress events,
the calculation of the size and development of countercyclical buffers, and the setting
of risk weights for different combinations of loan-to-value and loan-to-income.

Abstract
We develop a theoretical model of mortgage loss rates that evaluates their main
underlying risk factors. Following the model, loss rates are positively influenced
by the house price level, the loan-to-value of mortgages, interest rates, and the
unemployment rate. They are negatively influenced by the growth of house prices
and the income level. The calibration of the model for the US and Switzerland
demonstrates that it is able to describe the overall development of actual mort-
gage loss rates. In addition, we show potential applications of the model for
different macroprudential instruments: stress tests, countercyclical buffer, and
setting risk weights for mortgages with different loan-to-value and loan-to-income
ratios.

Bundesbank Discussion Paper No 34/2013
1 Introduction
Loss rates on mortgages have increased substantially in the US and many other coun-
tries during the financial crisis. At the same time, financial institutions were heavily
exposed to the mortgage market when the crisis started. Figure 1 displays the rela-
tionship between mortgages and charge-off rates in the US. As we can see, mortgages
increased strongly as long as charge-off rates were low. Therefore, the banks' exposure
was at its peak when the bubble burst and charge-off rates suddenly increased strongly.
As a result, many banks suffered high losses or even failed. In 2009 the FDIC recorded
140 bank failures for the US. As a comparison, in 2008 there were 25 bank failures and
from 2002 to 2007 only 21.
One reason for this was that financial institutions underestimated the risk associated
with mortgages. The development of the lending standards of banks and their the
mortgage supply1 indicates that financial institutions base their risk models on the
past performance of mortgages rather than on the main economic risk drivers. Among
others, these risk drivers are the income of borrowers and the development of house
prices.
Another reason for the extent of the crisis was that also existing banking regula-
tion and capital requirements did not adequately capture the build-up of risks in the
mortgage market and the resulting systemic impact. As a reaction, we see increasing
international efforts (especially by the Financial Stability Board, the BIS and the IMF)
to enhance macroprudential instruments in order to identify and monitor systemic risks
and to limit the build-up and/or the impact of these risks.2 The process is still ongo-
ing; however, key methodologies to identify systemic risks are constructing aggregated
indicators for systemic imbalances like the credit-to-GDP ratio and conducting macro
stress tests. The most prominent macroprudential instrument is the countercyclical
capital buffer, under which banks have to hold more capital in boom phases and can
use the buffer to cover losses in a downturn phase. A further instrument is the limi-
tation of loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios, which are important parameters for
banks to influence the risk profile of their mortgage loan portfolio.
Various papers evaluate the driving forces behind mortgage defaults and the result-
ing losses. Campbell and Cocco (2011), for example, examine default risks and develop
1Lown and Morgan (2006) show that lending standards (as measured by the Loan Officer Opinion
Survey of the Federal Reserve) are a key driver of loans.

a model where households maximize their discounted future utility from consumption
and housing. They finance their house by a mortgage and decide in each period whether
or not to default on the mortgage. The authors assume that the mortgage lender has
no recourse to the defaulter's income or savings. Following their model, households de-
cide to default when their home equity turns negative, meaning the value of the house
becomes smaller then the outstanding mortgage loan. However, the authors show that
if borrowing constrains are less binding (due to a higher income), households might
decide not to default even when home equity is negative.
Deng, Yongheng, Quigley, and Van Order (2000) argue that a mortgage borrower
has two separate options: a prepayment option and a default option. The authors
develop a unified model of these two options and show that the simultaneity of the two
options can help to explain borrower behavior. However, since in many countries there
are prepayment penalties and lenders have recourse to defaulters' income, the results
are mainly relevant for some US states like California.
Haughwout, Peach, and Tracy (2008) evaluate possible reasons for the strong in-
crease in early mortgage defaults in the US in 2006 and 2007. In their empirical
estimation they use credit risk variables like loan-to-value ratios and debt service-to-
income ratios as well as variables that capture the economic conditions like regional
unemployment rates or house prices. Their results indicate that both bad credit stan-
dards and bad economic conditions contributed to the increase in defaults and that
the economic conditions had the largest impact. However, the empirical model only
predicts less than half of the strong increase in early defaults after 2006.
While most studies focus on default rates of mortgages, Qi and Yang (2009) evaluate
different influence factors of the loss given default. Their empirical study is based on
a large pre-crisis loan level data set and indicates that the current loan-to-value ratio
is the single most important determinant of the loss given default.
The aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of mortgage loss rates,
meaning the product of default probabilities and loss given defaults. Furthermore, the
model serves as a basis for macroprudential instruments like countercyclical buffers.
The development of a foundation for these macroprudential instruments is the main
contribution of this paper.
In the theoretical model, banks provide mortgages to a priori identical households.
A heterogenous development of the households' income and house prices leads to the de-
fault of some households in the following period. In order to demonstrate the empirical
2
relevance of the model, we calibrate it for two countries that experienced pronounced
real estate crises within the past 25 years but had a different development: the US and
Switzerland. The results of the calibration are used to demonstrate the ability of the
model to estimate the impact of stress scenarios on mortgage losses, to calculate the
size and development of countercyclical buffers, and to set standards for risk weights
on mortgages with different loan-to-values and loan-to-incomes.
The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we develop the theoretical
model, in section 3 we calibrate the model, section 4 shows potential applications of the
model for macroprudential instruments, and section 5 offers some concluding remarks.
2 The Model
In this section we develop a theoretical two-period model that enables us to calculate
loss rates for mortgage loans. The basic setting of the model is very similar to Hott
(2011): in period t = 1 banks provide mortgages to a priori identical households. In
period t = 2 each household receives a random labor income and defaults if this labor
income plus the value of the house is too low to fulfill the mortgage duties. In contrast
to Hott (2011), however, we assume that the constant loan-to-value of mortgages is
less then 100%. In addition, we consider unemployment, maintenance costs for houses,
foreclosure costs, and a heterogenous development of house prices. By introducing
these additional features, the model becomes more realistic and, hence, more suitable
for describing actual loss rates on mortgages.
2.1 Basic Assumptions
2.1.1 Houses
There are S ex ante identical houses and in period t = 1 the price of house i is
Pi
1
= P1
, where i=1,...,S. Therefore, the value of the entire housing stock is SP1
.
Further, we assume that houses are subject to depreciation and that owning a house
leads to maintenance costs. The sum of the depreciation and the maintenance costs
(as a fraction of the house price) is assumed to be 1 >   0.
In period t = 2 the price of house i is assumed to be uniformly distributed between
(1 - )P2
and (1 + )P2
, where P2
is the average house price in t = 2 and  > 0 is the
maximum relative deviation from this average price. Therefore, in t = 2 the value of
3
the entire housing stock is SP2
.
2.1.2 Mortgages
In period t = 1 banks provide mortgages to households at the interest rate m1
> 0.
Since banks cannot ex ante differentiate between different households and different
houses, this mortgage rate is identical for each household. The loan-to-value (LTV)
is the constant l, where 0 < l < 1.3 Therefore, in period t = 1 the amount of all
mortgages is lSP1
. The maturity of each mortgage loan is assumed to be one year.
This implies that households have to refinance their mortgage every year.
When a mortgage borrower defaults, the house goes into the ownership of the bank.
We assume that the foreclosure and change in ownership causes costs. These foreclosure
costs are assumed to be a fixed fraction  of the amount of the mortgage. We further
assume that the bank has recourse to the defaulter's income.4
2.1.3 Households
There are N ex ante identical households. For simplicity, we assume that N = S.
Each of them buys the same fraction of the housing stock: S/N = 1. It uses its entire
wealth to finance the fraction (1 - l) of its housing investment. To finance the rest of
the investment, each household takes out a mortgage in the amount of lP1
.
On the one hand, in period t = 2 each household bears depreciation and main-
tenance costs of lP1
, where  =  /l. In addition, each household has to pay the
mortgage rate and has to pay back the mortgage: (1 + m1
)lP1
. Hence, its total ex-
penses are: (1 +  + m1
)lP1
. Further we assume that depreciation and maintenance
costs are senior to the mortgage payments.
On the other hand, household i owns a house which can be sold at the price Pi
2
,
where Pi
2
is uniformly distributed between (1 - )P2
and (1 + )P2
. In addition, we as-
sume that in t = 2 household i receives a labor income Y i
2
that is uniformly distributed
between zero and Y2
. With probability u2
a household becomes unemployed and re-
ceives an income of zero. In reality, in most countries the minimum (transfer) income
3Iacoviello (2005) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) also assume fixed LTV ratios when evaluating
the link between real estate prices and output. Campbell and Cocco (2011) show that in the US, LTV
ratios were relatively stable between 1984 and 2008.
4This might not be the case in some US states. However, following the results of Campbell and
Cocco (2011), income also matters if there is no recourse. In addition, as we will see, our model
provides relatively good results also for the US (see section 3).
4
is greater then zero. However, since we do not consider consumption expenditures, we
assume that the minimum income is used for an autonomous consumption and can,
therefore, not be used for mortgage payments.
Household i becomes insolvent in t = 2 if:
Pi
2
+ Y i
2
< (1 +  + m1
)lP1
or
Y i
2
<  + m1
- Pi
2
-lP1
lP1
lP1
. (1)
The right-hand side of equation (1) is also known as the imputed rent for housing.
This imputed rent is in line with the assumptions of many other studies on real estate
and mortgage markets. Poterba (1984 and 1992), McCarthy and Peach (2004), Him-
melberg, Mayer, and Sinai (2005), and Hott and Monnin (2008), for example, use very
similar factors to define imputed rents.
2.2 Calculation of Loss Rates
To calculate loss rates on mortgage loans, we first calculate the default probability
(PD) and the loss given default (LGD) of mortgages independently. The expected
loss rate is given by the multiplication of the PD and the LGD.
The calculation of the PD and the LGD depends strongly on the development
of house prices in t = 2. There are two extreme cases. In the first case, house prices
increase so strongly that no household defaults (PD = 0). This is the case if (1-)P2

(1 +  + m1
)lP1
. In the other extreme case, house prices fall so strongly that all
households default (PD = 1). This is the case if (1+)P2
+Y2
 (1++m1
)lP1
. Both
cases are not very realistic and will, therefore, not be considered. The intermediate
case can be divided into several subcases as well. However, we will only consider the
following case as the relevant case:5
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
1 + 
 P2

(1 +  + m1
)lP1
1 - 
and
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- Y2
1 - 
 P2
. (2)
5The calibration of the model confirms that this is the relevant case. See also Hott (2011).
5
In this range, neither households with the best performing houses (Pi
2
= (1 + )P2
)
nor households with the highest labor income (Y i
2
= Y2
) default. However, there are
always at least some households that default.
2.2.1 Probability of Default
Figure 2 illustrates which households default and which stay solvent. As we can see,
for a household with a labor income greater than [(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
], the
probability of a default is zero. Therefore, the probability that an employed household
has an income that leads to a positive default probability Pr(PD > 0|employed) is:
Pr(PD > 0|employed) =
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
Y2
. (3)
If a household is unemployed, this probability is one.
For households that can default (PD > 0), the default probability decreases with
labor income. For an unemployed household with zero labor income (Y i
2
= 0), the
probability of default is:
PD(Y i
2
= 0) =
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
2P2
. (4)
Under the condition that the labor income of an employed household is in a range where
there is a positive default probability, the default probability is 50% of PD(Y i
2
= 0).6
Multiplied by the probability Pr(PD > 0|employed) from equation (3) we obtain the
default probability of an employed household:
PD(employed) =
[(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
]2
4P2
Y2
. (5)
The unconditional PD is given by:
PD = u2
(1++m1)lP1-(1-)P2
2P2
+(1 - u2
)[(1++m1)lP1-(1-)P2]2
4P2Y2
. (6)
6Since each income in this range is equally likely.
6
As we can see, the PD depends positively on the unemployment rate (u2
), the depre-
ciation and maintenance costs (), the LTV, the mortgage rate (m1
), the house price
level in t = 1 (P1
), and the maximum deviation from the average house price in t = 2
().7 It depends negatively on the house price increase (P2
- P1
) and on income (Y2
).
Note that condition (2) assures that (3) to (6) lie between 0 and 1.
2.2.2 Loss Given Default
There are two factors that have an influence on losses for a bank when a mortgage
borrower defaults. Firstly, the difference between the outstanding mortgage (lP1
) plus
interest, depreciation and maintenance costs8 ((+m1
)lP1
), and the value of the house
in period 2 (Pi
2
) plus the income of the house (Y i
2
). The second factor are the foreclosure
costs (lP1
). As a result, the loss given default (LGD) of a mortgage to household i
is:
LGD(Pi
2
, Y i
2
) =
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- Pi
2
- Y i
2
lP1
+  (7)
For an unemployed household with zero income, the LGD can vary between  and
[(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
]/[lP1
] + . Since each of the LGD in this range is equally
likely, the expected LGD of an unemployed household is:
LGD(Y i
2
= 0) =
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
2lP1
+  (8)
The LGD of a mortgage to an employed household decreases linearly with the labor
income of the borrower. It varies between  for Y i
2
= (1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
(the maximum income for a PD greater than zero) and LGD(Y i
2
= 0) for an employed
household with zero income. As we have seen in section 2.2.1, the different LGDs are
not equally likely, however. The probability that a household defaults varies between
zero and the result of equation (4). The expected LGD of a mortgage to an employed
household is therefore:
LGD(employed) =
(1 +  + m1
)lP1
- (1 - )P2
3lP1
+ . (9)
7The relationship between  and PD depends on the development of the house price. In the
relevant range, however, PD/ is positive.
8Depreciation and maintenance costs have to be borne by the household or the bank. However, in
both cases the loss for the bank would be the same.
7
This LGD depends positively on , , m1
, l, , and P1
, it depends negatively on P2
and it is independent of the maximum income Y2
.
2.2.3 Expected Loss Rate
The expected loss rate in period t = 2 (EL2
) is given by the weighted average of the
product of the PD and LGD for unemployed and employed households:
EL2
= u2
(1++m1)lP1-(1-)P2
2P2
(1++m1)lP1-(1-)P2
2lP1
+ 
+(1 - u2
)[(1++m1)lP1-(1-)P2]2
4P2Y2
(1++m1)lP1-(1-)P2
3lP1
+  . (10)
As we can see, the expected loss rate depends negatively on income (Y2
) and on the
house price increase (P2
- P1
) and it depends positively on the unemployment rate
(u2
), the foreclosure costs (), the house price level (P1
), the loan-to-value (l), and the
mortgage rate (m1
). Furthermore, in the relevant range9 the expected loss rate also
depends positively on the heterogeneity of the house price development ().
These results are in line with the usual empirical findings. Deng et al. (2000), for
example, find empirical evidence that increasing interest rates and decreasing house
prices increase the probability of default. Furthermore, the authors find evidence that
a higher LTV leads to higher defaults. Qi and Yang (2009) examine defaults in the
US mortgage market and find the current LTV is the most important determinant
of the loss given default of a mortgage. Lambrecht, Perraudi, and Satchell (1997)
examine the UK mortgage market and find a positive relationship between interest
rates and default probabilities and a negative relationship between income and default
probabilities. Surprisingly, the authors also find a negative relationship between the
LTV and default probabilities. One explanation for this finding could be that high
LTV mortgages are only provided to households with low credit risk.
3 Model Calibration
To examine the empirical relevance of the model, we calibrate it for two different
countries: the US and Switzerland. Both countries have experienced a major real estate
crisis within the past 25 years. However, the overall development of the two mortgage
9See equation (2).
8
markets was rather different. Besides an in sample calibration we also calibrate the
crisis development out of sample, i.e. using only data up to 2005 Q4.
3.1 Data
According to equation (10) we need data on mortgage rates (mt
), house prices (Pt
),
unemployment rates (ut
), and the maximum household income (Yt
) to calibrate loss
rates. The maximum household income is calculated as (2GDPt
)/[(1 - ut
)Nt
] and by
using nominal GDP and population data (Nt
). To compare the resulting theoretical
expected loss rates with reality, we also need data on actual loss rates (Lt
). The
frequency of most data series is quarterly. Annual population data and the annual
loss rates for Switzerland are transformed into quarterly data by linear interpolation.
Table 1 provides a brief description of the data, the sources, and transformations.
3.2 Parameter Values
According to equation (10) we need parameter values for the LTV (l), the heterogeneity
of the house price development (), the depreciation and maintenance rate (), and the
foreclosure costs () for both countries. In addition, we need a conversion factor 
to adjust the level of GDP to the house price level (Yt
= 2GDPt
/[(1 - ut
)Nt
]).
Firstly, house prices (index values) and GDP are not expressed in the same unit and,
secondly, Y reflects only the (constant) fraction of the income that is available for
housing expenditures.
The first parameter is the loan-to-value (l). According to Green and Wachter (2005),
in the US the average LTV is 75% but it can go up to 97%. For the calibration we use
l = 0.75 for the average LTV in the US. In Switzerland a mortgage usually has a LTV
of 67% and it can go up to 100%. We use l = 0.67 for the calibration. To capture the
variation of the loan-to-value in both countries, we consider the difference between the
maximum and the average LTV in the heterogeneity of the house price development
().
The second parameter is the heterogeneity of the house price development ().
When calibrating a mortgage model for the UK, Miles (2005) uses 12.5% as the stan-
dard deviation of house price growth. Campbell and Cocco (2003) consider 11.5% when
evaluating the US mortgage market. This would imply around 22% for our parameter
9
.10 As already mentioned, we will also consider the difference between the maximum
and the average LTV in the parameter . We assume that the difference between the
maximum and the average LTV is equal to three standard deviations of the LTV .
Therefore, the add-on for  (maximum of a uniform distribution) is

3/3 = 1/

3
times the difference between the maximum and the average LTV . For the US the
resulting  is 35%, and for Switzerland it is 41%.
The literature offers different estimates of the depreciation and maintenance rate.
Harding, Rosenthal, and Sirmans (2006) estimate that the annual rate is between 2.4
and 2.9 percent. McCarthy and Peach (2004) assume that the depreciation rate plus
repairs is 2.5 percent per year and Poterba (1992) assumes that the sum of depreciation
and maintenance rate is four percent. For simplicity, we use  = 2.5% for each of the
two countries. Therefore, we obtain  =  /l = 3.3% for the US and  =  /l = 3.7%
for Switzerland.
Foreclosure costs () involve legal fees, taxes, insurance, commissions etc. Although
these costs might vary between countries, for simplicity, we assume that they are 15%
in both countries. This figure is based on anecdotal evidence from contacts with banks.
The fifth parameter is the conversion factor . For this parameter we do not have
an a priori assumption (except that it is positive). Therefore, we chose a parameter
value for  that solves the following minimization problem:
min

T
t=0
[ELt
- Lt+k
]2 (11)
subject to  > 0. While T - k is equal to the end of the data sample (2010 Q4 for
Switzerland and 2011 Q2 for the US) in our in sample calibration, it is 2005 Q4 in
our out of sample calibration. The parameter k reflects the lead of the theoretical
series compared to the actual series expressed as the number of quarters. The lead is
derived by looking at the maximum cross correlation of the two series. The choice of
the different parameter values is summarized in Table 2.
10The maximum deviation of the uniformly distributed heterogeneity of the house price development
is

3 times the standard deviation.

3.3 Calibration Results
Figure 3 displays the development of actual (Lt
) and theoretical expected (ELt
) in and
out of sample loss rates for the US and Switzerland. As we can see, the fit between
actual and theoretical in sample loss rates is quite good. In particular the model is able
to mirror the high loss rates during the crisis episodes: The current real estate crisis
in the US and the crisis in the early 1990s in Switzerland. According to Table 2, the
theoretical expected losses have a lead of k = 4 quarters. This reflects that in reality
it can take several periods until a bank knows how high the losses from a defaulted
mortgage really are.
For Switzerland, the difference between the in and out of sample expected loss rates
is negligible. For the US, however, we can observe a difference. This is no surprise,
since charge-off rates in the US experienced an unprecedented strong increase after
the end of 2005 and, therefore, the end of the considered data for the out of sample
calibration. Nevertheless, even the out of sample calibration of the crisis leads to a
relatively good fit with the actual development.
4 Macroprudential Applications of the Model
Our model and its calibration give us information about the impact of macroeco-
nomic developments on mortgage losses. This information can be used as an input for
macroprudential instruments. Important examples of macruprudential instruments are
conducting stress tests, introducing countercyclical buffers, and setting risk weights for
mortgages with different loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios.
4.1 Stress Tests
As a reaction to the recent crisis and in order to identify systemic risks, banking
supervisors and central banks are conducting more and more stress tests. In theses
stress tests banks are asked to calculate the impact of an adverse combination of
macroeconomic shocks on their profits and losses and, therefore, on their capital needs.
Our model can provide us with an alternative view on the impact of an adverse
scenario on a macro level. To demonstrate this, we calculate the aggregated impact of
the adverse scenarios from the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)
of the Federal Reserve Board for the US and the adverse scenario from the 2011 EU-
11
wide stress test of the European Banking Authority (EBA) for the UK.11 The scenarios
are summarized in Table 3.
The impact of the scenarios on expected losses (ELt
) is presented in Figure 4. The
solid (SCAP) and the broken grey (EBA) lines indicate that both scenarios lead to an
increase in expected losses. As we can see, the impact of the SCAP scenario is much
stronger then the impact of the EBA scenario. This is not a surprise since the assumed
GDP and house price declines are much higher. Another noteworthy outcome is that
both scenarios have a stronger impact on expected losses in the US than on expected
losses in Switzerland. The main reason for this is that we assume a higher LTV for the
US.
Compared to the estimates of the Fed with regard to the impact of the SCAP sce-
nario on US banks, our expected loss rates are relatively low. While the Fed estimates
indicate an aggregated two year loss rate of 7 to 8.5%,12 our model indicates only 5%
with an annual maximum of 3.3%. One reason for this might be that we are calculating
the expected losses under an adverse scenario and not adverse losses under this sce-
nario. According to Table 2, the difference between our estimate and the Fed estimate
is about three times the average difference between the expected and actual loss rates.
4.2 Countercyclical Buffers
With a countercyclical buffer, banks have to hold more capital when imbalances in the
credit market are building up. The aim of this additional requirement is that banks
have a higher capital buffer which they can use when the bubble bursts. Therefore, the
countercyclical buffer should compensate for the additional risk that arises from the
increasing imbalances. A further potential effect of the countercyclical buffer is that it
can help to lean against emerging bubbles.
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, 2010) proposes monitoring
the ratio of credit to GDP and the deviation from its trend to assess the phase of the
cycle and the build-up of the imbalances. The size of the buffer should then increase
with this indicator between zero and a (more or less arbitrary) maximum buffer size.
In our model the credit (or mortgage) volume is defined as a constant fraction l of
the house price Pt
multiplied by the housing stock S = N. GDP, on the other hand,
11The EBA stress test included scenarios for all EU countries. However, we only consider the
scenario for the UK.
12See Federal Reserve Board (2009b).
12
is given by (1 - ut
)NYt
/2. Hence, the ratio of credit to GDP (it
) is given by:
it
=
2SlPt
(1 - ut
)NYt
=
2lPt
(1 - ut
)Yt
. (12)
As an indicator for imbalances we take the difference between it
and its average iaverage.
To determine the size of the countercyclical buffer, we look at the impact of an above-
average it
on expected losses (ELt
). We rewrite equation (10) to:
ELt
= ut
lRt-1-(1-)(1+wt)
2(1+wt)
lRt-1-(1-)(1+wt)
2l
+ 
+it
(1 - ut
)2 [lRt-1-(1-)(1+wt)]2
8l(1+wt)
lRt-1-(1-)(1+wt)
3l
+  , (13)
where Rt-1
= 1 +  + mt-1
and 1 + wt
= Pt
/Pt-1
. The impact of an above-average it
on expected losses is then given by:
buffersize = ELt
=
(it
- iaverage)(1 - ut
)2 [lRt-1-(1-)(1+wt)]2
8l(1+wt)
lRt-1-(1-)(1+wt)
3l
+  . (14)
Capital requirements should make sure that banks hold enough capital to cover losses
in stress events. As a stress scenario for the capital requirements we take the strongest
historical drop in real estate prices in combination with the average mortgage rate or
Rt
, respectively. According to equation (14), the unemployment rate has a negative
effect on the buffer size. One reason for this is that the loan-to-income (LTI) is only
important for households that are employed. With a lower unemployment rate the
LTI is relevant for a higher fraction of the population. Another reason is that, given
a level of GDP, the income of an employed household has to be higher the higher the
unemployment rate is. Hence, for the stress scenario we take the average unemployment
rate. The scenarios for the two countries are summarized in Table 4.
Figure 5 shows the evolution of the resulting buffer size. It is assumed (as in the
BCBS proposal) that the buffer cannot be negative. As we can see, the countercyclical
buffer increases before the crises begin and loss rates increase. Hence, banks can use
the capital buffer to cover losses and the buffer requirements are gradually reduced to
zero.
The maximum buffer size is about 0.47% of the mortgage volume in the US and
about 0.25% in Switzerland. Reasons for the higher buffer size in the US are the
13
more adverse scenario and a higher LTV but also a greater imbalance during the stress
episodes. In contrast to the BCBS proposal, our buffer is not based on risk-weighted
assets but on loan volumes. If we assume average risk weights of about 35%, the buffer
size would reach a maximum value of about 1.34% in the US and about 0.71% in
Switzerland.
4.3 Risk Weights
The loan-to-value and the loan-to-income are the most important parameters for banks
to influence the risk profile of their mortgage loan book. According to equation (13),
both parameters have a positive effect on expected losses. Hence, risk weights for
capital requirements should increase with LTV and LTI.
Our model can help to estimate to which extent risk weights should increase with
both parameters and how strong the tradeoff between both parameters is. Figure
6 shows the impact of a change in LTV on expected losses for different LTI. These
expected losses are calculated according to equation (13). As in section 4.2 we consider
a stress scenario with the strongest historical drop in real estate prices and an average
interest rate level. Since the unemployment rate has a negative effect on expected
losses, we take the highest historical unemployment rate (US: 10.7%, Switzerland:
5.4%).
According to Figure 6, expected losses are higher in the US than in Switzerland. The
main reason for this is that the US scenario assumes a much higher drop in real estate
prices. In general, however, the relationship between LTV, LTI, and expected losses is
very similar: Expected losses increase with increasing LTV and with increasing LTI.
In addition, we can see that the impact of an increasing LTV is stronger when the LTI
is higher. These effects should be reflected when risk weights for capital requirements
for mortgages loans are set.
5 Conclusions
In this paper we develop a theoretical model of mortgage loss rates. Following the
model, loss rates are positively influenced by the house price level, the unemployment
rate, the loan-to-value, and interest rates. They are negatively influenced by the income
level and the growth of house prices. The calibration of the model for the US and
Switzerland has demonstrated that it is well able to describe the overall development
14
of the actual loss rates.
Potential applications of the model are the calibration of loss rates under stress
events, the calculation of the size and development of countercyclical buffer, and the
setting of risk weights for different combinations of loan-to-value and loan-to-income.
The model has two main shortcomings: First, the maturity of mortgage loans
is assumed to be one year. In reality, however, most mortgages have a much longer
maturity. Therefore, actual reactions to house price declines are smaller than predicted
by the model when they are only temporary, but they can become larger when house
prices decline over a longer period of time. A second shortcoming of the model is that
all the parameters are assumed to be constant. In reality, especially the loan-to-value
can react to the market sentiment and the lending conditions of banks and can therefore
vary over time. In spite of these shortcomings, however, the model is able to explain
the main developments of mortgage loss rates in the US and Switzerland. In addition,
it can serve as a basis for various macruprudential instruments. Efforts to make the
model more realistic should be aligned to the specific needs of its application.
