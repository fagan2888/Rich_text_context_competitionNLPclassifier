Differences in maternal characteristics only partially explain the lower birth weights of infants of African-
American women. It is hypothesized that economic and social features of urban neighborhoods may further
account for these differences. The authors conducted a household survey of 8,782 adults residing in 343
Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods to assess mean levels of perceived social support and used US Census data to
estimate neighborhood economic disadvantage. Data on birth weight and maternal risk factors were gathered
from 95,711 birth certificates (1994­1996). Before statistical adjustment of the data, infants born to African-
American mothers were found to be, on average, 297 g lighter than those born to White mothers. After adjustment
for individual-level risk factors, this difference was reduced to 154 g. For African-American mothers only, mean
birth weight decreased significantly as the neighborhood level of economic disadvantage increased. For White
mothers only, a significant positive association was found between perceived levels of neighborhood social
support and infant birth weight. Adding these neighborhood-level predictors to the model reduced the adjusted
White versus African-American difference in birth weight to 124 g. Results support the hypothesis that
neighborhood-level factors are significantly associated with infant birth weight.

In the United States, infants born to African-American
women are, on average, almost 300 g lighter and more than
twice as likely to be low birth weight than are infants of
White women (1). Approximately half of this increased risk
can be explained by maternal risk factors including age,
marital status, and cigarette smoking (2). Pronounced resi-
dential segregation in many cities has led researchers to
speculate that contextual or ecologic factors may also

contribute to the higher risk of low birth weights among
African-American women (1­4).
Investigators have begun to examine variation of birth
outcomes by administrative region or census tract in US
cities (5­11). Lower birth weights have been reported to be
associated with contextual-level factors including higher
rates of poverty (5, 10, 11) and unemployment (11), lower
neighborhood educational and income levels (5, 6, 11),
higher median rent (5), and higher rates of violent crime (3).
However, to our knowledge, all such multilevel epidemio-
logic investigations to date have relied on census and admin-
istrative data (crime rates, per capita health expenditures). It
has also been hypothesized that social processes not fully
reflected in such administrative data also vary between
neighborhoods and may contribute to the racial gap in birth
outcomes (5). Supporting this hypothesis are findings that
cohesive social networks, trust, and reciprocal exchanges
among residents are associated with lower rates of mortality
(12) and morbidity (13). Finally, epidemiologic evidence
indicates that, during pregnancy, social support from a
partner, family member, and others appears to improve fetal
growth (14, 15); neighborhood factors may contribute to
such support.
We hypothesized that economic and social features of
urban neighborhoods, in particular material disadvantage
and residents' perceptions of the level of cohesion and
support in their neighborhood, are related to the birth weight
of infants from those neighborhoods. We reasoned that there
may be several processes through which such neighborhood-
level factors translate into improved birth outcomes for
pregnant women, including access to medical care, proper
nutrition, promotion of desirable health behaviors, and stress
reduction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Neighborhood measures
Neighborhood-level data for the city of Chicago, Illinois,
were gathered in 1995 as part of the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) (16).
PHDCN was a large-scale interdisciplinary study designed
to provide new information about the role of neighborhood-,
family-, and individual-level factors in the development of
social functioning, mental health, and physical health status
(16). PHDCN combined a neighborhood-level study of the
entire city of Chicago and intensive investigation of 80
randomly selected neighborhoods, along with a longitudinal
cohort study of approximately 6,000 families. The consider-
able socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic diversity of the popu-
lation was a major reason that Chicago was selected as the
study site. By applying a spatial definition of "neighbor-
hood"--a collection of people and institutions occupying a
subsection of a larger community--we combined all 847
census tracts in Chicago to create 343 ecologically mean-
ingful and homogeneous "neighborhood clusters" by using
geographic boundaries and knowledge of traditional
Chicago neighborhoods. Following a cluster analysis in
which the census tract was the unit of analysis, we used
either single, large tracts or combined contiguous census
tracts that were comparable in terms of racial/ethnic compo-
sition, household income, educational levels, and housing
density to identify neighborhood clusters that each included
approximately 8,000 residents. These neighborhood clusters
were generated, in part, to provide adequate sample sizes for
the cohort-study component of PHDCN, which is not the
focus of this paper. Here, we refer to neighborhood clusters
as "neighborhoods," keeping in mind that other operational
definitions might also have been used; neighborhood clus-
ters are comparable to large census tracts.
We conducted a multistage probability household survey
of all neighborhood clusters. For 263 of the clusters, nine
census blocks were selected with a probability proportional
to population size; three dwelling units were selected at
random within each block, and an adult respondent (aged 18
years or older) was randomly selected within each of approx-
imately 20 households. The remaining 80 neighborhood
clusters were oversampled (approximately 50 respondents
per neighborhood cluster) for more intensive study by using
a simple random sample of census blocks and dwelling units
within blocks. The overall survey response rate was 75
percent.
Consistent with prior work with these data (17), we
derived a neighborhood-level measure of "neighborhood
support" (17, 18). Respondents were asked how strongly
they agreed (on a five-point scale) with 10 statements such
as, "This is a close-knit neighborhood" and "People do
favors for each other" (details provided in table 1). Resi-
dents' responses within neighborhood cluster were averaged
to construct the neighborhood cluster­level measure. This
scale has high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.82).
Because neighborhood-level poverty and other indicators of
economic disadvantage have been associated with both
lower levels of social cohesion (17­19) and birth outcomes
(5, 6), we sought a neighborhood cluster­level index of
economic disadvantage as a potential confounder in the rela-
tion between neighborhood support and birth weight. Using
data from the 1990 US Census, we derived an aggregate
measure of neighborhood economic disadvantage, calcu-
lated for each neighborhood cluster as the first principal
component of the proportion of residents 1) living below the
poverty line, 2) on public assistance, and 3) unemployed.
Both neighborhood cluster­level scales (neighborhood
support and economic disadvantage) were standardized
(mean, 0; standard deviation, 1). Racial/ethnic composition
(i.e., proportion African American) was determined by the
proportion of births to African-American women in each
neighborhood cluster.
Birth outcomes
Data on birth outcomes came from 1994­1996 birth certif-
icate files supplied by the Chicago Department of Public
Health. Multiple births and those for which data were
missing on birth weight or maternal risk factors were
excluded from the analysis, as were births from the one
neighborhood cluster for which we did not have census data.
Furthermore, our analyses included only those births to
mothers whose race was recorded as being either White (not
Hispanic) or African American.

Analytic approach
We estimated a set of four hierarchical linear regression
models (20, 21). Unmeasured neighborhood influences on
birth outcomes were represented by a pair of random effects,
one for White mothers and one for African-American
mothers (22­25). This approach 1) avoids the assumption
that the processes affecting birth outcomes are the same for
White and African-American mothers, 2) permits estimation
of how much variation in birth outcomes lies between and
within neighborhoods for White and African-American
mothers, and 3) adjusts standard errors to take into account
the clustered nature of the sample.
We estimated models that controlled for individual-level
characteristics and behaviors (infant's gender, prenatal care,
maternal age, mother's marital status, maternal smoking,
maternal education, and parity) before testing for associa-
tions between neighborhood characteristics and birth weight.
Exploratory analysis demonstrated that maternal age was
curvilinearly related to birth weight and could be modeled as
a quadratic function of age (thus, our models included terms
for maternal age and the square of age) and that the number
of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy and the
number of years of maternal education were linearly associ-
ated with birth weight. Both parity and prenatal care were
modeled as dichotomous variables, indicating primiparity
(first birth) and receipt of any prenatal care, respectively.
Model 1 included only the estimated White and African-
American neighborhood-mean birth weights, which
provided estimates of the variance in birth weight observed
between and within neighborhood clusters and the correla-
tion between African-American and White neighborhood-
mean birth weights across neighborhoods. Model 2 added all
individual maternal risk factors and infant gender. To this
model, we added the racial/ethnic composition (proportion
African American) of the neighborhood and economic
disadvantage (model 3). Finally, we added neighborhood
support to the model (model 4). We also conducted several
general linear hypothesis tests (20) to assess whether the
joint effect of a group of predictors could be differentiated
from zero and whether White versus African-American birth
weights differed.
All hierarchical models presented were estimated by
restricted maximum likelihood using Hierarchical Linear
and Nonlinear Modeling (HLM) software (26). All other
statistics presented in this paper were estimated by using
SYSTAT (27) and Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (28)
software.
RESULTS
Of the 101,723 singleton births recorded to either African-
American or White mothers, 2,731 (2.6 percent) could not be
mapped to one of the 343 neighborhoods; for 1,753 (1.7
percent), no valid birth weight was available. For the 97,239
remaining birth certificates, 334 (0.3 percent) of the births
occurred in the excluded neighborhood and 1,194 (1.2
percent) certificates did not list maternal education and were
excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 95,711 births,
29,788 were to White mothers and 65,923 were to African-
American mothers.
Infants born to African-American mothers were 297 g
smaller, on average, than White infants and were 2.6 times
more likely to be of low birth weight (table 2). Compared
with White mothers, African-American mothers were
younger and more likely to be in their teens, have no high

school degree, be unmarried, to have smoked during their
pregnancy, and to have received late or no prenatal care.
We divided the 343 neighborhoods into those in which the
large majority of births are to African-American women
(>90 percent; n = 135), those in which the large majority of
births are to White women (<10 percent of births to African-
American women; n = 98), and the remaining more hetero-
geneous group of 110 neighborhoods. The vast differences
in the social circumstances in which African-American and
White pregnant women live and the great degree of racial
segregation were evident (table 3). More than 85 percent of
births to African-American women occurred in only 135 (39
percent) of Chicago's 343 neighborhoods. Mean birth
weights decreased and low birth weight proportions
increased in neighborhoods in which more African-
American births occurred. For neighborhoods in which most
(>90 percent) births were to African-American women, the
average proportion of adults living below the federal poverty
level was 31.2 percent, five times greater than for the
majority White birth (>90 percent) neighborhoods (6.2
percent). This situation was further reflected in the values of
the composite index of economic disadvantage; there was
little overlap in the economic levels of majority African-
American and majority White birth neighborhoods.
Residents' perceptions of neighborhood support also
varied considerably across neighborhoods. Residents in
neighborhoods in which mostly White births occurred
reported a mean value of neighborhood support of 0.63, indi-
cating above-average cohesion, trust, and supportive interac-
tions among neighbors. The mean values for the majority
African-American birth neighborhoods were one standard
deviation lower than those for the White birth neighbor-
hoods. Unlike economic status, levels of neighborhood
support reported in majority African-American neighbor-
hoods overlapped considerably with the levels in majority
White neighborhoods.
Model 1 (table 4) represented birth outcomes as a function
of means for African-American and White mothers plus a
pair of random effects for each neighborhood. The estimated
neighborhood-mean birth weight for infants born to White
mothers (3,376 g) was greater than the neighborhood-mean
birth weight for infants of African-American mothers (3,103
g), a difference of 273 g (p < 0.0005). Variability in mean
birth weights between neighborhoods was statistically
significant for both African-American and White mothers (p
< 0.0005 for both), although the proportion of variance
between neighborhoods was small (0.57 percent for African-
American mothers and 0.93 percent for White mothers).
There was an association between African-American and
White birth weights such that neighborhoods manifesting
greater birth weights for White mothers also tended to show
greater birth weights for African-American mothers (r =
0.423).
Model 2 included individual-level maternal characteristics
and infant gender only. Educational level, receipt of prenatal
care, being married, and giving birth to a male baby were
positively associated with birth weight, while primiparity
(first birth) and smoking predicted lower birth weight. The
direction of these effects was similar for White and African-
American mothers, although, in all instances except for the
gender of the baby, African-American and White coeffi-
cients were significantly different from one another.
Maternal age is the one case in which we found a significant
(negative) effect for African-American mothers and no
significant effect for White mothers. When we held constant
all explanatory variables at their grand means, the expected
birth weight for White mothers (3,497 g) remained greater
than for African-American mothers (3,343 g); the difference
was 154 g (p < 0.0005).

African-American mothers, mean birth weight decreased
13.1 g for each standard deviation increase in neighborhood
economic disadvantage (p < 0.05). A similar, yet nonsignifi-

might be explained by the fact that neighborhood economic

American than for White mothers. Again holding constant
all explanatory variables at their grand means, we found that
the expected birth weight for White mothers (3,466 g)
remained greater than for African-American mothers (3,345
g), a difference of 121 g (p < 0.0005) compared with the
difference of 154 g based on model 2. Controlling for
economic disadvantage alone accounted for most of the
between-neighborhood variance in birth weight estimated in
model 2. Specifically, economic disadvantage accounted for
80.8 percent of the between-neighborhood variance for
African-American mothers and 76.3 percent for White
mothers.
Model 4 added neighborhood social support as an explan-
atory variable. The estimated association was significantly
positive for White but not for African-American mothers.
For Whites, an increase of one standard deviation in neigh-
borhood social support was associated with a 17.5-g higher
mean birth weight. For African-American mothers, the
corresponding coefficient (­4.7) was nonsignificant. These
two coefficients were statistically significantly different
from each other (p < 0.0005). For Whites, controlling for
neighborhood social support in addition to neighborhood
economic disadvantage explained 90.9 percent of the
between-neighborhood variance estimated in model 2. Anal-
yses conducted for infants born to White mothers only indi-
cated that infants in neighborhoods in the top tertile of
support had statistically elevated birth weights compared
with those in low- or medium-support neighborhoods. In
contrast, infants born in those neighborhoods reported as
least supportive had mean birth weights similar to those in
medium-support neighborhoods.
DISCUSSION
For White mothers only, results indicate a positive associ-
ation between levels of neighborhood support and the birth
weights of infants born in these neighborhoods. This associ-
ation was independent of the level of economic disadvantage
of the neighborhood, racial/ethnic composition, and several
established individual-level risk factors. The reports of
neighborhood support did not come from the pregnant
women themselves. We did not seek to test the hypothesis
that level of perceived support reported by individual preg-
nant women is associated with higher birth weight of their
infants. The current results support a more distal mechanism,
namely, that the level of support reported by a representative
sample of residents enhances birth weight throughout the
neighborhood. Neighborhood support may serve as a health-
promoting factor, with positive effects accruing when some
threshold is surpassed. In our data, this threshold was not
arbitrary; the turning point corresponded with a value on the
scale of neighborhood support (top tertile) for which resi-
dents were more likely than not to state that they trusted and
interacted with their neighbors.
For predominantly African-American neighborhoods, we
found no association between levels of neighborhood
support and infant birth weight. Because social cohesion and
interactions among neighbors are not perceived equally by
all residents of a neighborhood, we calculated estimates of
neighborhood support based on reports from African-
American respondents only. Again, no association was
found between perceived neighborhood support and the birth
weight of African-American infants. However, we found a
significant effect of level of economic disadvantage on the
birth weight of African-American infants only. As unem-
ployment, poverty, and public assistance levels increased,
the mean birth weight of African-American infants
decreased.
The lack of association between neighborhood support and
birth weight for African-American infants may, in part, be
attributable to the level of residential segregation and the
social climate in Chicago and other US cities. Although
many births to African-American women occur in neighbor-
hoods that, overall, are reported to be highly supportive, few
neighborhoods are perceived as such by their African-
American residents. Our data did not permit an adequate test
of whether African-American mothers would accrue the
same benefit in birth weight associated with higher levels of
neighborhood support that was demonstrated for White
mothers because there were few African-American mothers
living in neighborhoods perceived as supportive by their
African-American neighbors. In settings of economic disad-
vantage, opportunities to generate or sustain social support at
the neighborhood level may be constrained. In more advan-
taged neighborhoods, African-American mothers may expe-
rience real or perceived discrimination that serves to distance
them from the generally favorable social climate experi-
enced by Whites.
While the total proportion of the variation in infant birth
weight at the neighborhood level was small compared with
the variation between individual infants, the role of neigh-
borhood characteristics is still of public health significance.
The six established individual risk factors included in these
analyses (such as maternal age, education, smoking during
pregnancy, and receipt of prenatal care) accounted for only
5.3 percent of the variance in individual birth weights. In
contrast, the three neighborhood variables (racial/ethnic
composition, economic disadvantage, and neighborhood
support) accounted for more than 80 percent of the variance
in birth weight between neighborhoods. The proportion of
variance in birth weights between neighborhoods was small
(0.57 percent for African-American mothers and 0.93
percent for White mothers) but statistically significant, and
we could account for this variation. Second, these neighbor-
hood-level factors impact the mean birth weight of hundreds
of pregnant women per neighborhood. Small neighborhood
effects such as those noted may have large population
impacts.
Several of the individual-level maternal risk factors we
controlled for, such as maternal smoking and lack of prenatal
care, may be consequences of lower neighborhood support.
For instance, neighborhoods with higher levels of cohesion
and interpersonal interaction may encourage mothers to seek
prenatal care or to stop smoking during pregnancy. If so,
then our decision to include these as individual-level factors
would underestimate the amount of variation in birth weight
that could be attributed to neighborhood factors. A limitation
of the current investigation was the lack of individual-level
data on mothers' perceived social support and detailed infor-
mation on socioeconomic status (beyond marital status and
Birth Weight of Urban Infants 7

educational level). White mothers in higher support neigh-
borhoods may perceive and receive greater social support
themselves, accounting for the noted association between
neighborhood support and birth weight. Similarly, the lower
socioeconomic opportunities of African-American women,
rather than the level of economic disadvantage of their
neighborhoods, might account for this association among the
African-American sample. Ideally, future investigations of
neighborhood influences on birth weight will address this
limitation.
The current analysis draws on and contributes to previous
literature demonstrating an association between neighbor-
hood-level social processes and health outcomes. Our
measure of "neighborhood support" is conceptually related
to constructs of social capital (12, 29), cohesion (30), and
collective efficacy (17). These constructs all reflect social
processes that may operate within a neighborhood or other
collective context to the benefit of residents. While prior
investigations have examined sociodemographic, composi-
tional, and other structural features of neighborhoods, this is
the first known to examine such perceived social processes
at the neighborhood level in relation to birth outcomes. We
did not attempt to differentiate between the impact of
specific forms of neighborhood support (for example, instru-
mental vs. emotional support, perceived vs. received
support) that have been identified in individual-level studies
(15); such work may warrant future investigation.
Neighborhood support, as broadly conceived, could
operate through several mechanisms to improve infant birth
weight. First, it may foster a local climate of encouragement,
information, and tangible aid that contributes to maternal
health and fetal growth (31, 32). For example, social support
has been consistently associated with reduced cigarette
smoking and substance abuse during pregnancy (14, 33, 34).
Second, social network researchers have argued that
community ties may provide positive reference groups and
exert pressures to conform to health-promoting normative
standards (35­37). Neighborhood support could thus result
in improved utilization of and compliance with medical care
as well as positive health-care behaviors during pregnancy.
Finally, partial but inconsistent evidence exists that high-
quality social support may also directly affect intrauterine
growth by dampening adverse hormonal and immunologic
reactions to stressors (33, 38).
These results add to the growing evidence that commu-
nity-wide social processes have positive effects on the health
and well-being of residents. Taken together, the growing
evidence of the health benefits of neighborhood cohesion,
support, and engagement suggests this as an area of potential
impact for public health policy and practice.
