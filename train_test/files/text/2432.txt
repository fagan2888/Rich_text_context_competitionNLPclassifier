Abstract
This study aims at identifying the association between physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) patterns during
adolescents on the future increase in BMI and risk of diabetes during young adulthood. A total of 3,717 participants aged 11
to 21 at baseline who completed Waves I (1994­1995), II (1996), III (2001­2002), and IV (2008) surveys of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were analyzed. Physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns were
assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire at Waves I, II, and III. A participant was classified as having
diabetes at Wave IV according to WHO guidelines. The k-means cluster analysis was used to identify the number of PA and
SB patterns assessed using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The k-means cluster analysis identified three clusters;
575 (15.5%), 2,140 (57.6%), and 1,002 (27.0%) participants belonged to the low PA high SB (LPAHSB), the LPALSB, and the
HPALSB cluster respectively. Relative to the LPALSB cluster, the HPALSB cluster had lower increase in BMI from Wave III to
Wave IV (P = 0.03), whereas the difference between LPAHSB cluster and LPALSB cluster was not significant (P = 0.09). The
odds of developing diabetes at Wave IV was significant for the LPAHSB cluster (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.04, 2.75) but not
significant for the HPALSB cluster (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.52, 1.47) relative to the LPALSB cluster. To conclude, PA but not SB
during adolescence predicted change in BMI during young adulthood. SB but not PA during adolescence predicted type 2
diabetes during young adulthood.

Introduction
Diabetes is becoming more serious worldwide. A recent
systematic review showed that from 1990 to 2010, the global
disability-adjusted life year and global years lived with disability
attributed to diabetes have increased by 69% [1] and 68% [2],
respectively. High BMI and low physical activity are two well-
known risk factors of type 2 diabetes, yet they are still epidemic.
High BMI and low physical activity are ranked second and sixth,
respectively, in the global risk factors of disability-adjusted life-
years in high-income North America [3]. Type 2 diabetes is a
disease not only among older adults but also among adolescents
[4] and young adults [5], partly because of their high and
sustained prevalence of obesity [6] and low physical activity [7].
Physical activity is a multi-dimensional, complex behavior that
involves many attributes, such as duration, frequency, intensity
level, and domains (such as leisure activity, occupational activity,
or transport-related activity). Multiple domains have shown
different effects on health. For instance, a recent study showed
that occupational and household physical activity but not
transportation and leisure time physical activity were associated
with metabolic syndrome [8]. Furthermore, analysis of physical
activity data will become more complicated if sedentary behaviors
have to be taken into account. Recent studies showed that
sedentary behaviors are risk factors for mortality, independent of
physical activity level [9]. Given that different domains of physical
activity maybe correlated, using traditional regression analysis with
physical activity is not preferred, because multicollinearity
problem will arise when correlated domains of physical activity/
sedentary behavior variables are adjusted. The multicollinearity
problem can be avoided using cluster analysis, a simple method of
identifying the number of distinct patterns and their corresponding
characteristics in a sample. Cluster analysis has been used to
identify patterns of self-reported physical activity [10], sedentary
behaviors [11], and objectively-assessed physical activity [12].
As the interlocking effects of BMI, physical activity, and type 2
diabetes have not been fully established, this study aims to explore
the longitudinal association between patterns of physical activity
and sedentary behaviors during adolescence and the increase in
BMI and prevalence of diabetes during young adulthood, using
data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health), a 14-year longitudinal cohort that followed the
participants from adolescence in grades 7 to 12 to young
adulthood.

Materials and Methods
Participants
The sample of Add Health comprises 80 nationally represen-
tative high schools in the United States and one randomly chosen
feeder school from the 60 high schools that without a 7th grade,
selected using a systematic sampling method. Overall, 79% of the
schools (n = 134) agreed to participate and 90,118 adolescents in
grades 7 to 12 completed an in-school questionnaire in Wave I
(1994­1995) and 20,475 of them completed an in-home interview.
A parent or guardian of the participants was invited to complete a
parent-in-home questionnaire that included demographics, socio-
economic status, information of spouse, and relationship with
child. The present analysis was based on 6,504 participants with
publicly available data. Among this group of participants, 4,834,
4,882, and 5,114 completed the Wave II (1996), Wave III (2001­
2002), and Wave IV (2008) interviews, respectively. At Waves I
and II, only in-home interviews were conducted, while at Waves
III and IV biological specimen were also collected. A total of 3,808
(58.5%) participants aged 11 to 21 (3,449 of them (90.6%) aged 13
to 17) at Wave I completed all Waves, and 62 of them were
removed due to missing physical activity and sedentary behavior
variables. After removal of outliers in physical activity and
sedentary behaviors items (n = 29), 3,717 (97.6%) participants
were included in the present analysis. The incidence of diabetes
and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviors between
the 3,717 study participants and the 2,758 excluded participants
were similar, but significant differences were found in sex (45.9%
vs 51.6%, P,0.001), smoking (20.4% vs 26.1%, P,0.001), and
drinking (22.9% vs 30.4%, P,0.001). Figure S1 in File S1 shows
the study design of Add Health. The data and the details of the
study can be found in its official Web site, http://www.cpc.unc.
edu/projects/addhealth/, and the Minimal Dataset is available at
File S2. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Written
consent of both the adolescent and their parent were obtained.
Measurement
Leisure time physical activity and sedentary behaviors at
Waves I to III were assessed using an interviewer-administered
questionnaire. The interviews at Waves I and II included 11
items examining the frequency (Not at all, 1 or 2 times, 3 or 4
times, and 5 or more times) and duration (hours per week) of
physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the week preceding
the interview (shown valid and reliable [13]). The interviews at
Wave III included the 11 items administered at Waves I and II
plus 4 additional items that are applicable to young adults [14].
Note that for some of these activities (such as the item ``In the
past seven days, how many times did you engage in a hobby such
as working on a collection, playing cards or board games, arts
and crafts, drama, playing a musical instrument or singing with a
group, or shopping just for fun?'') we cannot tell whether the
nature of them are physically active or sedentary, thus were
removed from further analysis. As a result, only 25 out of the
available 37 items were included in the current analysis (7 at
Wave I, 7 at Wave II, and 11 at Wave III). Table S1 in File S1
shows these physical activity and sedentary behaviors variables.
Height and weight at Waves I and II were self-reported, whereas
those at Waves III and IV were measured by the interviewers
following standardized protocols (details can be found in the Add
Health website, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/
codebooks/wave3). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided
by the square of height (m2). As the variable of interest was the
change in BMI over time, according to similar studies [15], raw
BMI values are reported as opposed to standardized values.
Information for education level of parent-in-home was collected
at Wave I. Diabetes at Waves I to II and III was identified by
parent-in-home and participants themselves respectively. Glucose
and HbA1c level at Wave IV were obtained from dried blood
spot assays. The glucose measure (available in 2,894 out of the
3,717 participants) was classified as fasting if the measurement
was taken at least eight hours after last meal and non-fasting
otherwise. A participant demonstrated evidence of diabetes at
Wave IV if any of the following is met: [16] (1) fasting glucose $
7.0 mmol/dL, (2) non-fasting glucose $11.1 mg/dL, (3) hemo-
globin A1c $48 mmol/mol (or 6.5%), (4) self-reported history of
diabetes, or (5) reported taking anti-diabetic medication.
Statistical analysis
The k-means cluster analysis [17] was used to identify the
number of physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns in the
sample using 25 physical activity and sedentary behavior variables.
All these variables were standardized to a mean and a standard
deviation of 0 and 1 respectively using wave-specific means and
standard deviations to equalize their importance. The k-means
cluster analysis aims to group the participants into non-overlap-
ping clusters by minimizing the within-group sum of squares. First,
k (a pre-specified integer) cluster centers were randomly generated.
Then, participants were assigned to the cluster with the shortest
distance to these cluster centers. Finally, the cluster centers were
recomputed using the new cluster assignment, and these steps
would be iterated until convergence was achieved. To determine
the best cluster solution, within group-sum of squares for k = 1 to
15 were computed and the best k was determined using the elbow
method [18]. The first two discriminant components were used
[19] to characterize the clusters. The k-means cluster analysis
using the Hartigan and Wong's algorithm [20] was performed
using R 3.0.1 (R development core team).
One-way ANOVA (and Tukey post-doc test if significant) and
Pearson's x2 test were used to compare the differences between
clusters for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The
increase in BMI from Wave III to Wave IV and the incidence of
diabetes were adjusted for age, sex, smoking and drinking habits
[21] at Waves I and III, education level of parent-in-home, and
parental history of diabetes, using linear regression and logistic
regression, respectively. The logistic regression for incidence of
diabetes excluded participants with diabetes history at Waves I to
III (n = 32) and was further adjusted for BMI at Wave I. Given
that the BMI were different between the clusters (see the Cluster
profile: demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, life-
styles, and biomarkers subsection below for details), for the
increase in BMI from Wave III to Wave IV, the same analysis was
repeated on non-overweight (BMI,25) participants. Smoking and
drinking habits at Wave II were not adjusted to avoid multi-
collinearity problem (Kappa = 0.61 and 0.49 for smoking and
drinking respectively, both p,0.001). These analyses were
performed using IBM-SPSS version 20.0.
Sensitivity analysis
To confirm the association of PA, SB on increase in BMI and
type 2 diabetes, regressions were fitted using the original PA and
SB variables as independent variable and change in BMI and type
2 diabetes as dependent variable, with the same set of confounders
adjusted. Another set of logistic regression with diabetes cases at
Waves II and III (n = 7) included were performed.

Results
Cluster analysis
Figure S2 in File S1 shows the within-group sum of squares of
cluster solutions from k = 1 to 15. As a substantial reduction of
within-group sum of squares from k = 2 to 3 were observed, a
three-cluster solution was deemed appropriate. The k-means
cluster analysis identified three clusters; 575 (15.5%), 1 002
(27.0%), and 2 140 (57.6%) participants belonged to clusters 1, 2,
and 3 respectively. Table S1 in File S1 shows the loadings of the
first two discriminant components of the physical activity and
sedentary behavior variables. According to the loadings, the first
and second components were labeled ``exercise frequency'' and
``sitting time''. Figure 1 shows the plot of all participants on the
first two discriminant components. Note that participants in cluster
1 had more sitting time, and hence, this cluster was labeled as
``LPAHSB (low physical activity, high sedentary behavior)
cluster''. Compared with cluster 2, participants in clusters 3 had
more sitting time and at the same time exercise more frequently,
and hence, clusters 2 and 3 were labeled as ``LPALSB (low
physical activity, low sedentary behavior) cluster'' and ``HPALSB
(high physical activity, low sedentary behavior) cluster'' respec-
tively.
Cluster profile: physical activity and sedentary behavior
Table 1 shows the sedentary behavior time variables in the
three clusters. Time spent watching TV and videos at Waves I and
II among participants in the LPAHSB cluster were nearly tripled
compared with participants in the other two clusters. The trend of
sedentary time was also different across clusters. Participants in the
LPAHSB cluster had no change in time playing computer games
from Wave I to Wave III (hours per week from 8.05 to 8.87,
P = 0.24), whereas an increase was observed for participants in the
HPALSB cluster (from 2.51 to 4.85, P,0.001) and LPALSB
cluster (from 1.44 to 3.33, P,0.001). Note that participants in the
HPALSB cluster had longer sedentary time than those in the
LPALSB cluster. However, the differences between these two
clusters were of negligible effect sizes with an average Cohen's d
effect size of 0.10 (in which a value of .0.2 indicates clinically
significant effect [22]).
Table 2 shows the physical activity and sedentary behavior
frequency variables in the three clusters. For a clear presentation,
only frequencies and percentages of the category ``five or more
times'' were listed. Proportion of participants engaged in sports
and exercise activities in the HPALSB cluster was much higher
than that in the other two clusters. At Wave I, more than half
(53.7%) of the participants in the HPALSB cluster had engaged in
active sports, but this number was reduced to 26.3% and 13.0% in
the LPAHSB cluster and LPALSB cluster respectively. At Wave
III, participants in the HPALSB cluster were more likely to engage
in all sports and exercise activities items. Note that participants in
the LPAHSB cluster had more frequent engagement of physical
activity than those in the LPALSB cluster. However, the
differences between these two clusters were of negligible effect
sizes with an average OR of 1.73 and 1.43 for Wave I and Wave II
respectively (in which a value of .2 indicates clinically significant
effect [22]).
Cluster profile: demographic characteristics,
socioeconomic status, lifestyles, and biomarkers
Table 3 shows the profile (continuous variables) of the three
clusters. The mean BMI of the participants at Wave I was 22.43
kg/m2. The standardized BMI (Z-score) of the participants at
Waves I and II were 0.37 (SD 1.02) and 0.36 (SD 1.03)
respectively (CDC 2000, http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/
percentile_data_files.htm). The HPALSB cluster has the smallest
mean age and BMI at all Waves, and the LPAHSB cluster has the
largest. The fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels at Wave IV
were the same across all clusters, whereas the non-fasting glucose
level of the participants in the LPAHSB clusters was higher than
those in the LPALSB clusters (P = 0.007). On average, the
participants had an increase of 2.68 kg/m2 in BMI from Wave
III to Wave IV, and participants in the LPAHSB clusters had the
greatest increment of 3.32 kg/m2.
Table 4 shows the profile (categorical variables) of the three
clusters. The LPAHSB cluster and HPALSB cluster were
composed mainly of male participants (58.3% and 64.3%,
respectively) whereas the LPALSB cluster was composed mainly
of females participants (66.0%). Participants having a parent or
caregiver with bachelor degree or above were more likely to be in
the HPALSB cluster. Participants in the HPALSB cluster had the
healthiest lifestyles; only 12.3% and 18.6% were current smokers
and binge drinkers at Wave I, whereas these numbers increased to
22.4% and 24.1% for the LPAHSB cluster, and for the LPALSB
cluster the corresponding percentages were 23.7% and 24.5%
respectively. Among the participants, 4.1% of their fathers and
5.3% of their mothers had diabetes. Participants having a mother
with diabetes were more likely to be in the LPAHSB cluster. At
Wave IV, 212 (6.5%) participants demonstrated evidence of
diabetes, and those belonging to the LPAHSB cluster had the
highest prevalence (11.1%).
Following adjusting for age, sex, smoking and drinking habits at
Waves I and III, education level of parent-in-home, and parental
history of diabetes, participants in the LPAHSB cluster, the
HPALSB cluster, and the LPALSB cluster had an average BMI
increment of 3.55 kg/m2 (95% CI = 2.68,4.42), 2.51 kg/m2 (95%
CI = 1.70,3.32), and 3.04 kg/m2 (95% CI = 2.28,3.79) respectively
(Figure 2, left). Relative to the LPALSB cluster, the HPALSB
cluster had lower increase in BMI from Wave III to Wave IV
(difference = 20.53, 95% CI = 21.01,20.04, P = 0.03), whereas

(Table S2 in File S1). Similar findings were obtained if only non-
overweight participants at Wave III were analyzed. Relative to the
LPALSB cluster, the HPALSB cluster had lower increase in BMI
from Wave III to Wave IV (difference = 20.56, 95% CI =

Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviors, BMI, and Diabetes

(95% CI = 3.0%,12.1%), and 6.9% (95% CI = 3.7%,12.9%)
respectively (Figure 2, right). Compared with the LPALSB cluster,
the LPAHSB cluster had significantly greater odds for developing
diabetes (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.04,2.75, P = 0.03), whereas no
significant difference was found for the HPALSB cluster
(OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.52,1.47, P = 0.61) (Table S3 in File S1).
Sensitivity analysis
The results of the linear regression on increase of BMI and the
logistic regression on incidence of type 2 diabetes were shown in
Tables S4 and S5 in File S1 respectively. The results of these two
regression models confirmed that of the cluster analysis. There
were five significant PA variables, but none of the SB variables
were associated with the increase of BMI, on the other hand time
spent on SB on Waves I and III were associated with the incidence
of type 2 diabetes. The negative association between TV viewing
at Wave II and type 2 diabetes may be a result of multicollinearity.
All the PA variables that were associated with the incidence of type
2 diabetes had relatively high discriminant loadings on the SB
component (Table S1 in File S1).
The ORs did not differ from the original logistic regression with
participants having type 2 diabetes at Waves II and III removed
(the OR for the LPAHSB cluster was 1.67 (95% CI = 1.03,2.72,
P = 0.04) and the OR for the HPALSB cluster was 0.89 (95%
CI = 0.54,1.49, P = 0.67), relative to the LPALSB cluster).
Discussion
The cluster analysis identified three clusters of physical activity
and sedentary behaviors across the three Waves. Participants in
cluster 3 had low physical activity and high sedentary behaviors.
Those in cluster 1 had similar level of physical activity but higher
level of sedentary behaviors than cluster 3, while those in clusters 2
similar level of sedentary behaviors but higher level of physical
activity than cluster 3. Note that a reduction of physical activity
from adolescence to young adulthood was observed in all the three
clusters, whereas a reduction of 25.8% in time spent watching TV
(hours per week reduced from 31.3 to 23.2) was observed in the
LPAHSB cluster. This was consistent with the previous finding
with the same dataset that physical activity declined with age [14].
Current smokers at Waves I to III was less likely to be in the
HPALSB cluster, and girls were more likely to be in the LPALSB
cluster. Participants in the LPAHSB cluster had the greatest BMI
whereas those in the HPALSB cluster had the lowest BMI. These
findings were consistent with those of previous studies [11]. More
than one-fourth (27.0%) of the participants belonged to the
HPALSB cluster, comparable with a previous finding of 29% [23]
(percentage of active high school students).
Although inadequate physical activity is a well-established risk
factor of diabetes [24­26] and high BMI or obesity [27], very few
studies analyzed the joint effect of physical activity and sedentary
behaviors. For example, consistent with our finding that partic-
ipants in the LPAHSB had a larger longitudinal increase in BMI, a
meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled studies in children and
youth showed that decreasing sedentary behavior led to an
average of 0.89 kg/m2 decrease in BMI [28]. However, the vast
majority of these studies used the standard exposure-outcome
approach treating TV viewing as exposure, BMI as outcome, and
physical activity as confounder, ignoring the effect of other
sedentary behaviors including time spent playing computer games
and watching videos. Using a cluster analysis approach, we can see
that sedentary behaviors were not associated with change in BMI.
Our finding is consistent with a recent cross-sectional study on US
adults examining the joint association between physical activity,
sedentary behaviors, and BMI that found no association between
BMI and total sedentary time [29], and this finding suggests a
possibility that the association between sedentary behaviors and
obesity is mediated by physical activity [26], which is usually
lacking in sedentary people [30]. In addition, the observed
association between TV viewing and BMI could also be mediated
by unhealthy diet, which was supported by a study among US
children that an additional hour of sitting was associated with 167
kcal of energy intake [31].
It is evident that sedentary behaviors and physical activity lead
to type 2 diabetes with independent effects among adults [25,30],
but this study only confirmed the effect of sedentary behaviors [24]
but not physical activity among adolescents. There are several
explanations on this phenomenon. First, it was suggested that the
association between physical activity and type 2 diabetes is
mediated by body fat [25]; thus during the 14 years of follow-up
only the control of body fat by physical activity was observed and a
longer follow-up period is required to observe the effect between
body fat and type 2 diabetes. Second, pervious study showed that
blood glucose level was more strongly correlated with cardiore-
spiratory fitness than energy expenditure [32], therefore it is
possible that cardiorespiratory fitness mediates the association
between physical activity and type 2 diabetes. Third, the most
commonly engaged sedentary behavior in our sample, watching
TV, which comprised of 55% to 70% of the total sedentary time,
was shown to be associated with unhealthy diet [33] and this can
partially explain the association between sedentary behaviors and
type 2 diabetes. Fourth, the follow-up period may be too short for
Figure 2. Adjusted change in BMI and incidence of diabetes of the three clusters (LPAHSB: low physical activity high sedentary
behavior; HPALSB: high physical activity low sedentary behavior; LPALSB: low physical activity low sedentary behavior).

observing the effect of physical activity on type 2 diabetes. A recent
study showed that change in BMI was associated with risk of
metabolic syndrome [34]. It is therefore possible that lack of
physical activity leads to change in BMI, which was shown by the
current study, and this group of participants, although did not
have elevated risk of diabetes at Wave IV, was having higher risk
of metabolic syndrome and elevated risk of type 2 diabetes at
future. The findings of this study extend the literature by
suggesting possible pathways of the preventive effect of physical
activity on type 2 diabetes.
The strength of this study lies in the large, nationally
representative cohort data with 14 years of follow-up period.
Although the study participants had a slight difference in terms of
demographic characteristics with the excluded participants, we
believe that the results can be generalized to adolescents in US,
and the biasedness induced for estimating the true effect of PA/SB
on increase of BMI and incidence of type 2 diabetes will be minor.
The use of cluster analysis allows identification of physical activity
and sedentary behavior patterns specific in adolescents. Never-
theless, this study was not without limitations. First, physical
activity and sedentary behaviors were self-reported, which was
somewhat inaccurate [35,36]. Similarly, height and weight at
Waves I and II were self-reported. In addition, non-exercise
physical activity such as job-induced activity was not assessed. To
the best of the author's knowledge, there are only cross-sectional
studies examining objectively measured physical activity and self-
reported diabetes [12], and they could not infer causality. Thus,
further research based on objectively measured physical activity is
warranted. Also, as there were very few participants that engaged
in both high volumes of sedentary behavior and physical activity
and/or exercise, the joint effect of them could not be evaluated.
Second, diabetes at Waves I to II and III was identified by parents
and participants themselves respectively, and no blood samples
were collected. Therefore, only participants with diagnosed
diabetes reported could have been excluded from the regression
analysis and those with undiagnosed diabetes were included which
might induce bias. Also, the type of diabetes was unknown.
However, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in adolescents is
low [5], so this limitation belongs to a minor one. Lastly, there are
only limited data on dietary intake pattern data, which is a possible
confounder of the association between TV watching and BMI
increase [25,30].
To conclude, relative to the participants in the LPALSB cluster,
those in the HPALSB cluster at adolescence had lower increase in
BMI during young adulthood but no reduced risk of type 2
diabetes, while those in the LPAHSB cluster at adolescence had
higher risk of type 2 diabetes but no difference in the increase of
BMI during young adulthood. For people with low levels of
physical activity engagement, reducing sedentary behaviors is
protective for type 2 diabetes. Future research of the effect and
mechanism of reducing sedentary behaviors on the risk of type 2
diabetes is warranted.
