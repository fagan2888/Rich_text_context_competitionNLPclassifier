showing an adverse relationship between high N and mental
and physical well being (Goodwin and Friedman, 2006), whereas
high C tends to be related to more positive mental and physical
health outcomes (Smith, 2006); moreover, these relationships
tend to be relatively stable across the lifespan (Goodwin and
Friedman, 2006; Martin et al., 2007; Kern and Friedman, 2008).
E has shown a more equivocal relationship to health outcomes,
showing both positive and negative health implications, while
much less attention has been paid to how O and A have relate to
mental (Kern and Friedman, 2008) or physical health (Booth-
Kewley and Vickers, 1994).
The reason for the personality­health relationship is still not
well understood, but there is some indication that there are at
least three different, although not mutually exclusive, possible
mechanisms for the relationship (Caspi and Roberts, 2001). First,
personality differences may just be behavioral manifestations of
differences in underlying pathogenesis. Second, since personal-
ity differences are associated with health-promoting or health-
damaging behaviors,the personality­health relationship might be
attributed to the fact that people with certain personality constel-
lations tend to engage in better/worse health-promotion. Third,
personality differences may be more of a reflection of how people
react to mental and/or physical illness, such as coping behaviors,
modulation of distress,and treatment adherence.A major caveat in
these studies, however, is that historically they have been confined
to samples of adults. Thus Caspi et al. (2005) write that research-
ers in this area need to "turn their attention to earlier periods in
development in order to understand enduring research and public
health puzzles" (p. 475).
Current study
Given the potential importance of personality in understanding
differences in health outcomes,it appears imperative that studies of
child and adolescent physical and mental health include such meas-
ures. To that end, this study investigated the measurement of per-
Introduction
Personality is a meaningful predictor of important life outcomes
such as occupation selection (Filer,1986),job performance (Ones
et al., 1993; Judge et al., 1999), and academic success (Poropat,
2009).Moreover,personality factors have been found to be related
to various health outcomes (Deary et al., 2010), such as mor-
tality (Schwartz et al., 1995), accident involvement (Clarke and
Robertson, 2005; Sümer et al., 2005), health behaviors and out-
comes (Hampson et al.,2006; Roberts et al.,2007),and even health
knowledge (Beier and Ackerman, 2003). Some even contend that
most psychology-related variables used in studying health (e.g.,
optimism, hopelessness, self-efficacy, locus of control) simply
reflect different aspects of personality (Marshall et al., 1994).
There are multiple conceptions of personality structure and
the best way to measure the varying arrangements (Stankov et al.,
1995), but many in the field have reached a working consensus
that there are five broad, super-ordinate factors/domains from
which a wide variety of personality-related behaviors and con-
stellations can be classified (Digman, 1990; McCrae and Costa,
2008), commonly referred to as the Five Factor Model (FFM) or
the"Big Five"(Digman,1990; McCrae and Costa,1997,2008).The
five factors are: Openness to Experience (O), Conscientiousness
(C), Extraversion (E), Agreeableness (A), and Neuroticism (N; see
Table1 for descriptions).Variability in these five factors appears to

and throughout adulthood (McCrae and Costa, 2003).

The researchers sought to develop a personality measure from items inWave I of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.The study found 13 items from three dimensions of
personality (neuroticism, extroversion, and conscientiousness), and then examined the factor
structure and internal consistency of each of the three dimensions. Within each personality
dimension, the items showed a unidimensional factor structure and internal consistency
estimates of the summed similar to scores from NEO Personality Inventories.The results can
be used to further examine how child/adolescent personality is related to multiple mental and
physical health outcomes in the Add Health database.

sonality inWave I of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health; (Udry and Bearman, 1998). The Add Health
study is a comprehensive examination of child/
adolescent health,
designed to measure numerous variables related to physical and
mental well being in adolescence.Originally designed to investigate
how social contexts (e.g., family, friends, schools, neighborhoods)
and individual characteristics influence adolescent health and risk
behaviors,theAddHealthdataincludesvariablesrelatedtophysical
and mental health; interpersonal relationships and sexual behav-
iors; education; delinquency and violence; adolescent involvement
in adult roles; various genetic and biological measures of disease
presence and processes; as well as a variety of measures about the
environmentsinwhichtheparticipantslive,gotoschool,andwork.
Wave I of the study began collecting data during the 1994­1995
school year, when the participants were in grades 7­12, and the
most recent wave of data (Wave IV) was collected in 2008 when
the participants were between the ages of 24­32 years old. The
most recent phases of the study examined the effects of the vari-
ous contexts and health during the transition from adolescence to
early adulthood.
There were no specific personality instruments used as part
of the variables collected during the first three waves of data
collection. However, a portion of the questions from Wave I of
the study's questionnaires could possibly be used to develop a
personality measure. To date, no study has examined these ques-
tions to determine: (a) if the survey questions from Wave I had
a lexical relationship to questions from other measures specifi-
cally designed to measure personality? (b) If so, could any of the
questions be aggregated to form a scale? (c) If questions could be
aggregated,what is the internal consistency of such scales? and (d)
Do these scales actually measure personality factors? Thus, this
study was designed to answer these four questions with the hopes
that if dimensions of personality can be measured in the Add
Health data, they can then be used to investigate the relationship
between child/adolescent personality traits and health outcomes
both proximally (in childhood/adolescence) and distally (early
adulthood).
Materials and Methods
Study design
TheNationalLongitudinalStudyofAdolescentHealth(AddHealth)
was initiated in 1994 under a grant from the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development with co-funding from 17
other federal agencies. Researchers in this study collected data in
multiple waves through the use of in-home, in-school, and school
administratorquestionnaires.Itwasdesignedtobethelargest,most
comprehensive survey of adolescents ever undertaken to study the
health-related behaviors of adolescents (grades 7 through 12) and
their outcomes in adulthood.Moreover,theAdd Health sample has
multiple sub-samples such as participants who are twins,adoptees,
and siblings, as well as information on the participants'family and
social networks,all of which can be used to help understand genetic
and environmental influences on physical and mental health prac-
tices and outcomes (Duncan et al., 2001).
Sample
ThesampleforthisstudycamefromalltheAddHealthparticipants
who completed theWave I In-Home and In-School questionnaires
(n = 20,745).Fifty percent of the respondents were female and their
ages ranged from 11.42 years) to 21.42 years (mean 16.16 years,
SD = 1.72 years).Of the 20,745 respondents,12,747 (61.45%) self-
reported being Caucasian,4,807 (23.17%) wereAfrican-American,
1,584 (7.64%) were Asian-American, 740 (3.57%) were American
Indian, with the remaining participants not identifying their race.
In addition,3525 (16.99%) of the respondents self-reported having
Hispanic ethnicity.
Instrument development and psychometric analysis
To develop measures of personality traits from the Add Health
Wave I survey items, we combined the lexical (John et al., 1988)
and factor analytic (Floyd and Widaman,1995) approaches.Both
methods have a long history in the development of personal-
ity scales (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1985; Barenbaum and Winter,
2008) and both approaches have made contributions to the meas-
urement and understanding personality (Lohman and Rocklin,
1995).
Lexical approach. First, we selected a criterion instrument that
was designed to measure the FFM personality domains and
subsequently made a list of the all the item stems in each of
the five domains. The criterion we used was the International
Personality Item Pool (IPIP; (Goldberg et al., 2006) version of
the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; (Costa and
McCrae, 1992a). The IPIP NEO-PI-R was selected because (a) it
was designed to measure multiple aspects of each factor of the of
the FFM; (b) is in the public domain; (c) it has a statement-based
Table 1 | Description of the five-factor model of personality.
Dimension Description
Neuroticism (N) Characteristics are related to anxiety and emotional liability versus being placid and emotionally stable
Extraversion (E) Characteristics are associated with enthusiasm toward life's circumstances, outgoing, and surgency versus introversion
gravity; encounter with oneself and one's life circumstances
Openness to experience (O) Characteristics are associated with the willingness to have new experiences, engage new ideas, and be open to one's own
feelings versus being cynical and tough-minded
Agreeableness (A) Characteristics are related to an inclination toward submission to others, passivity, and subduedness versus being
independent and having a strong will
Conscientiousness (C) Characteristics are related to being reliable, responsible, and having self-control versus impulsivity and casualness

(CFI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR).
These indexes were chosen as they represent both absolute and
relative fit indices, and they tend to perform well in simulation
studies (Marsh et al., 2005). While it is tenuous to use absolute
cut-off values for fit indices, usually factor models tend to do an
adequate job representing the data when: (a) the RMSEA value
is less than 0.08 (Chen et al., 2008); (b) the CFI value is greater
than 0.96 (Yu and Muthén, 2002); and (c) the SRMR value is less
than 0.08 (Sivo et al., 2006). Because fit indices tend to get bet-
ter in EFA as more factors are extracted, we looked for the most
parsimonious number of factors that would produce adequate
values that best fit the data.
For the third criterion, we examined pattern coefficients from
the various extractions to gage factor interpretability.While this is
more subjective than the other methods we employed,it is still one
of the most important steps in determining the number of factors
to extract (Gorsuch, 1992).
Internalconsistency.For each personality factor/domain we found
from the previous steps, we summed the items scores within a
domain and assessed the internal consistency of the scores using
all the respondents in the sample. We assessed internal consist-
encyusingbothCronbach'salphaandMcDonald'somega(Zinbarg
et al., 2005).
Predictive validity evidence. In Wave IV (2008) of the Add Health
design, the In-Home instrument purposely collected personality
data based on the FFM.For each factor,the questionnaire included
four questions. There were 14,800 participants who had data at
both Wave I (1994­1995) and Wave IV (2008). We correlated the
factor scores (using IRT/CFA) collected from the Wave I person-
ality measure with the factor scores (again, using IRT/CFA) from
the Wave IV personality measurement to examine the predictive
validity of the Wave I scales.
Results
Lexical method
Searching theWave I questionnaires yielded 21 items that appeared
to measure neuroticism (N) (8 items), extroversion (E) (7 items),
and conscientiousness (C) (6 items).
Factor analytic methods
There were missing responses for the 21 items ranging from less
than 1 to 34.50% of the sample, with 24 of the respondents hav-
ing no response recorded for any of the items. Consequently,
the subsequent factor analyses were conducted using the 20, 721
participants with at least one item score (half being used for
the EFA analysis, and the other half being used for the CFA/IRT
analysis). For the EFA, missing data was handled using pairwise
present method (Kaplan, 2009), whereas the CFA/IRT analysis
used the full information maximum likelihood estimator (Enders
and Bandalos, 2001) with the delta paramaterization and logit
link. All factor analyses were conducted in Mplus (Muthén and
Muthén, 2010).
For the IL-EFA, the RMSEA values indicated that four factors
should be extracted, but the CFI, SRMR and MAP test indicated
that only three factors should be extracted. When we examined
format that matches many of the items from the Add Health sur-
veys; (d) the NEO instruments have been used in a wide usage of
clinical and research settings (Costa and McCrae, 1992a,b); and
(e) the NEO-PI-R has been shown to work well in adolescent
samples (De Fruyt et al., 2000). Second, we searched the Add
Health Wave I In-Home and In-School questionnaires for items
that lexically or conceptually matched statements from the IPIP
NEO-PI-R1.
Factor analytic approach. The purpose of the factor analytic
approach was twofold. The first purpose was to assess the dimen-
sionality of the items found in the lexical approach, while the
second was to examine how each of the found items measured
its respective personality domain. McCrae and Costa (2004; cf.
McCrae et al.,1996) recommend assessing dimensionality of NEO
items via principal components analysis (PCA). Other method-
ologists have criticized using PCA because it was designed for
use with continuous variables, but items on personality tests
are typically categorical (Waller et al., 1996; Panter et al., 1997).
Neglecting the continuous-variable assumption of PCA,and other
traditional exploratory factor analytic (EFA) techniques,can lead
to factor extraction problems because the item thresholds (dif-
ficulties) are not taken into account (Bernstein and Teng, 1989).
Consequently, we assessed item dimensionality using item-level
exploratory factor analysis (IL-EFA), which accounts for item
thresholds by using polychoric correlations estimated via a robust
weighted least squares estimator (Flora and Curran, 2004) to
measure the relationship among the items (Muthén and Kaplan,
1992).
Once we determined the dimensionality of the items, we then
conducted an item-response theory/confirmatory factor analysis
(IRT/CFA;(Brown,2006;KamataandBauer,2008)toexaminehow
well each of the items measured their respective personality factors/
domains. For the IRT/CFA analysis, we used a robust maximum
likelihood estimator.As fit measures are not yet well developed for
IRT/CFA with item-level data, and because our sample size was so
large, we used the IRT/CFA estimates as a cross-validation of the
EFA results (Bandalos, 1993), although we did not expect there to
be large differences (Kay, 2004). Consequently, we randomly split
the participants into two groups and conducted the EFA on the
first group and the IRT/CFA on the second group.
To determine the number of factors to extract in the IL-EFA,
we used three criteria. First, best practices in EFA (Osborne et al.,
2008) suggest using more traditional techniques (e.g., minimum
average partial test,MAP;(Velicer et al.,2000) to examine the num-
ber of factor to extract. Consequently, we used the MAP test with
the polychoric correlations as input. To conduct the MAP test, we
used the SPSS syntax provided by O'Connor (2000), which uses
the original correlations (i.e., the polychoric correlations) in all the
MAP test steps.
Second, we examined the IL-EFA fit statistics after extracting
one to five factors. The fit statistics we used were the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index
1The survey was designed such that all participants with answers to the In-Home
questionnaire also had answers to the In-School Questionnaire.

well as the values for the shortened version of the NEO-PI-R, the
NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Across the N, E, and C
domains, the internal consistency estimates for the Add Health
personality scales are almost identical to the averages from the
NEO-FFI (largest difference: 0.04) and are very close to averages
for all the NEO instruments (largest difference:0.07), which is
remarkable given that the current scales have from 3 to 6 items,
whereas the NEO-PI-R has 60 items for each scale and the NEO-
FFI has 12 items for each scale.
Predictive validity
The results from the analysis of the personality data gathered in
Wave IV (2008) of the Add Health study is given in Table 6. As the
table shows, all the Wave IV items had relatively high pattern coef-
ficients on their intended factor.More importantly for the study of
the Wave I (1994­1995) items is that the correlations between the
Wave I and Wave IV factors, although modest, are in the expected
directions.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to determine how to best measure
personality from existing data in a longitudinal dataset that does
not utilize a specific personality instrument as part of its collected
data.Using survey questions fromWave I of the Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we sought to determine (a)
if the survey questions from Wave I had a lexical relationship to
questions from other measures specifically designed to measure
personality? (b) if so, could any of the questions be aggregated

the pattern coefficients, we found five items across both the three-
and four-factor extractions that measured little in common with
the other items (i.e., all pattern coefficients <0.30 and all com-
munalities <0.14). In addition, there were three additional items
that had moderate pattern coefficients (between 0.48 and 0.58) on
the four-factor solution and low coefficients (<0.30) on the three-
factor solution, but the content of these items did not appear to
overlap with each other. Consequently, we removed these 8 items
andconductedanadditionalIL-EFAontheremaining13items.The
values of the IL-EFA criterion measures all converged to indicate
that a three-factor solution bet fit the data. The results from both
IL-EFAs are given in Table 2.
The pattern coefficients for the IL-EFA are given in the first part
of Table 3. Each item had a large coefficient (>|0.69|) in only one
domain and small coefficients (<|0.19|) for the other two domains.
Thus,while the final 13 items are measuring three dimensions,each
item appears to only measure one factor (i.e., the three factors the
items are measuring appear to be unidimensional). The pattern
coefficients from IRT/CFA are given in second part of Table 3 and,
as expected, are very similar to those from the IL-EFA, with the
maximum absolute difference being 0.06.
Table 4 shows the final 13 items, similar items from the IPIP
NEO-PI-R, and where they can be located in the Add Health ques-
tionnaires and database. The results from Tables 3 and 4 indicate
that the 13 items used in this study are similar in content to the
IPIP NEO-PI-R items that measure C, E, and N.
Internal consistency
The first two rows of data in Table 5 show the internal consistency
estimates for the C,E,and N personality scales we developed from
Wave I of the Add Health data. While the values are similar to
internal consistency estimates typically found for scores on per-

into a better context by comparing them to the results of a recent
meta-analysis (Caruso, 2000) of various NEO instruments' score
reliability. The last two rows on data in Table 5 contain the aver-
age coefficient alpha values reported for all NEO instruments as

a few possible reasons for the weak correlations between the two
waves of data collection, such as the amount of time between data
collection of Wave I and Wave IV, personality being measured in
early adolescence, or the possibility of poor measurement of the
construct in Wave IV.
Conclusion
The Add Health study uses longitudinal survey data, combined
with contextual data, to study how the relationship of social
environments and behaviors in adolescence influence health and
achievement outcomes. The data is accessible in both public and
restricted use formats. The public-use data is free for download-
ing from two sources, but is limited in the variables that can be
accessed. Specific instructions for accessing the Add Health data,
as well as the variables included in the public and restricted use
files, are found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/
data. Having measures of personality in the Add Health data
provide opportunity for the investigation of child/adolescent
personality to a myriad of physical and mental health outcomes,
both proximally (in childhood/adolescence) and distally (in
adulthood). Specifically, neuroticism, extroversion, and consci-
entiousness could be included in models investigating physical
and psychological health outcomes such as depression, substance
abuse, and pregnancy in adolescence and early adulthood; data
that is included in the Add Health study.
Furthermore,existing personality research suggests that various
personality traits tend to moderate or mediate the relationship of
several mental health outcomes, such as depression (Ayotte et al.,
2009) and eating disorders (Eggert et al., 2007) and the interactive
relationship of specific traits,such as extroversion and neuroticism,
are related to overall well being (Lynn and Steel, 2006). Having
measures of personality in a large,longitudinal dataset,such as the
Add Health dataset, allows researchers to investigate the nature of
the relationship (mediating,moderating,or interactive) of person-
ality traits to other variables associated with various mental and
physical health outcomes.
to form a scale? (c) if questions could be aggregated, what is the
internal consistency of such scales? and (d) do these scales actually
measure personality factors?
We compared the questions used in Wave I of the Add Health
study with items from the IPIP (Goldberg et al., 2006) version of
the NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae, 1992a). Then we subjected
those items to an item-level factor analyses to determine what
items to keep, as well as the dimensionality of the domains the
items measured. We found that there were 13 items that meas-
ured neuroticism (N), extroversion (E), and conscientiousness
(C) ­ three of the major super-ordinate dimensions of personal-
ity. Although there were only a few items in each of these three
personality domains, the factor structure of the items indicates
they each measure only one construct (i.e., domain scores are
unidimensional) and the N, E, and C scores appear to have inter-
nal consistency estimates (alpha

Young and Beaujean Measuring personality in the add health data
Frontiers in Psychology|Quantitative Psychology and Measurement July 2011 | Volume 2 | Article 158 | 6
This study also provides a method for creating measures of
personality from other large-scale studies, potentially allowing
researchers to investigate personality-related outcomes within the
context of other large datasets. The ability to create personality
measures within other large-scale data sets allows researchers to
further investigate the relationship of personality traits to other
mental and physical health outcomes not included in the Add
Health study, but nonetheless important in serving mental and
physical health needs of children and adolescents that have poten-
tial ramifications throughout the lifespan.
Despite the size of the sample and strength of methods
employed,the current study is not without limitations.One limi-
tation is the inability to directly compare how the scores from the
personality factors extracted in this study relate to scores of other
standardized measures of personality. Another limitation is that
because the Add Health study did not use a specific measure of
personality,we could only extract three of the five major personal-
ity factors, and the factors we could extract are made up of only
limited number of items.
