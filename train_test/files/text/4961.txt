Abstract
Extra care housing facilities in the UK are intended to offer a community-based alternative to care
home placement. However, little is known about staff views of the appropriateness of extra care
housing for people with dementia. This paper describes a mixed-methods study which explored
this issue using statistical modelling of frontline staff recommendations of the best care setting for
care home entrants; thematic analysis of transcripts from a simulated Resource Allocation
Management Panel meeting; and content analysis of care coordinators'reasons for not considering
extra care housing in actual care home applications. Frontline practitioners saw extra care housing
as a valuable alternative for a significant minority of care home entrants. However, extra care
housing was not recommended if people needed care at night. Social care managers expressed
general support for the idea of extra care housing, but appeared overwhelmingly focused on

Introduction
The promotion of personal choice, autonomy and control are central aims of health and
social care policy in many countries (Winblad et al., 2016). As a result, the long-term care
continuum for older people with mental health problems (including those with dementia),
which has traditionally ranged from care at home to admission to a care home or long-stay
hospital ward is changing. The overriding aim is to enable older people to live at home as
long as possible. Furthermore, where some form of residential care is required, the desire is
to make this as homelike as possible (Moise, Schwarzinger, & Um, 2004). To this end, a
range of new facilities have been developed which provide `housing with care' for older
people, including a number of specialist facilities for older people with dementia (Evans et
al., 2012; Verbeek, Van Rossum, Zwakhalen, Kempen & Hamers, 2009). Some of these
initiatives are designed to serve as alternatives to long-term care home placement, such as
the small-scale living complexes found in the Netherlands (Verbeek et al., 2009) and the
Green Houses seen in the US (Kane, Lum, Cutler, Degenholtz, & Yu, 2007); others are
positioned at an intermediate point between living at home and institutional care, such as
Sweden's group living schemes (Annerstedt, 1994).
In the United Kingdom, a number of extra care housing (ECH) facilities have been
developed with the intent of providing a community-based alternative to care home place-
ment (Department of Health, 2010). Although there is no standard definition of ECH (also
known as very sheltered housing), such schemes typically offer older people their own flat as
well as care and support in a purpose-built complex designed with the needs of highly
dependent people in mind (Department of Health, 2010; Netten, Darton, B
aumker, &
Callaghan, 2011). Personal care (often provided by an on-site care team) is generally avail-
able 24 hours a day and communal facilities typically include a laundry, restaurant/dining
room and lounge (Laing & Buisson, 2010).
To date, several studies have explored the characteristics of ECH residents and how they
differ from those of older people living at home or in a care home (B
aumker, Netten, &
Darton, 2010; Darton et al., 2012; Netten et al., 2011). In summary, this work suggests that
ECH residents need more assistance with personal care and domestic tasks than older
people living at home (Netten et al., 2011), but less assistance with activities of daily
living (ADLs) than care home residents (Darton et al., 2012). Nevertheless, over half of
ECH residents are unable to go outdoors or manage steps or stairs, a similar proportion
require assistance with washing and bathing, and over a third need help with dressing
(Netten et al., 2011).
Other research has focused on the ability of ECH to promote independence and security
and reduce isolation (B
aumker et al., 2010; Callaghan & Towers, 2014; Shaw, West, Hagger,
& Holland, 2016). For example, one English study found that older people who had moved
2 Dementia 0(0)
into ECH identified a significant decrease in their unmet needs and a significant increase in
their quality of life compared with their situation at home (B
aumker et al., 2010). Another
reported that 80% of ECH residents described their social well-being as either `good' or `as
good as it can be'; 90% had made new friends; 85% were positive about their social life; and
75% were occupied in activities of their choice (Callaghan, Netten, & Darton, 2009).
Although such studies have included people with cognitive impairment, they have usually
formed only a minority of the sample, and it has often been suggested that older people with
dementia are less likely to participate (and hence be socially isolated) than other residents in
ECH (Callaghan et al., 2009; Croucher, Hicks, & Jackson, 2006; Dutton, 2009).
Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence to show that the quality of life of people with
dementia in ECH is generally good, particularly where staff have specialist dementia exper-
tise, enabling them to develop meaningful relationships and provide specialised activities
(Dutton, 2009).
In contrast, there has been little focus on how recommendations of ECH entry are made
by frontline staff and managers. Indeed, although many studies have examined the factors
that predict care home admission for people with dementia (Gaugler, Yu, Krichbaum, &
Wyman, 2009; Luppa, Luck, Br
ahler, K
onig, & Riedel-Heller, 2008), evidence is lacking
about the factors that predict transition to ECH, or health and social care professionals'
perspectives on the best use of such facilities (i.e. who is most appropriately supported in
ECH). This is despite the fact that such information would seem to be of great value to
service planners seeking to optimise resource use and to frontline practitioners, facilitating
the provision of advice and transition planning. Against this background, this paper
presents new, previously unpublished analysis of the views of a range of frontline practi-
tioners and managers on when ECH is the most appropriate option for older people with
mental health problems, in particular dementia, and examines the barriers to its wider use
with this client group.
Methods
This paper uses three strands of data (see Table 1) to explore the potential use of ECH for
current care home entrants in Site X, a `prospering smaller town' whose older residents had
a sociodemographic profile resembling England as a whole, albeit the proportion from
ethnic minorities was less than half the English average. At the time the study was con-
ducted, the number of people in long-stay residential care was close to the England average
(15.1 per 1000 people aged 65þ compared with 14.1 nationally), but there were fewer care
home beds. The local authority was interested in exploring the use of ECH as an alternative
to care home placement and had recently upgraded several sheltered housing complexes into
ECH for older people; however none of these were specifically dedicated to the care of
people with dementia. The data were collected as part of a Balance of Care (BoC) study,
which sought to identify the most appropriate mix of community and institutional services
to provide for older people with mental health problems in North-West England (Challis et
al., 2014; Tucker, Brand, Wilberforce, Abenstern, & Challis, 2015). Balance of care is a long-
standing strategic planning framework, identifying people whose needs can be met in more
than one setting (e.g. in hospital or at home) and exploring the potential costs and con-
sequences of changing the mix of services provided in a simulation exercise grounded in the
knowledge of frontline practitioners (Challis & Hughes, 2002; Clarkson, Hughes, & Challis,
2005; Tucker et al., 2015; Tucker, Hughes, Burns, & Challis, 2008).

Strand 1. Care planning workshop. The identification of care home entrants for
whom ECH could be more appropriate: Frontline practitioners' recommendations
Anonymised information on 169 older (65þ) care home entrants with mental health prob-
lems was collected by their care co-ordinators. Data collection was undertaken in 2010/2011
and encompassed details of individuals' sociodemographic, functional and clinical charac-
teristics, including a number of standardised measures (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975;
Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2003; Mahoney & Barthel, 1965; Morris et al., 1994;
Yesavage et al., 1983). Further information was collected on individuals' recent service
receipt and reason for admission. Short-term admissions for planned respite or intermediate
care and people moving from one care home to another were excluded.
The sample was divided into subgroups of people with similar needs for care on the basis
of three variables deemed important in determining the locus of care (Tucker et al., 2008).
These were the individuals' need for help with ADLs, their level of cognitive impairment and
the presence of behaviours that carers often find hard to manage (Table 2). As each of these
variables had three levels, we could generate 27 unique combinations of these variables,
representing subgroups or `case types' of patients (3 Â 3 Â 3).
A series of vignettes (n ¼ 14) were formulated to exemplify the most commonly populated
case types. These were based on real individuals in the dataset and took the form of short case
summaries depicting the person's situation immediately before care home entry ­ the point at
which alternative care options could realistically have been considered. Each vignette sys-
tematically incorporated information about the three key variables listed above, as well as the
risk of falling, physical health status, living situation, service receipt, location on assessment
(hospital or home) and care preferences. An example of a vignette is given in Box 1.
A range of frontline practitioners (NHS and Social Care staff) were invited to a care
planning workshop in October 2011 at which the most appropriate ways of meeting the
needs of the people depicted in the vignettes were explored. Workshop participants (n ¼ 17)
were divided into small multidisciplinary groups, each of which was allocated six vignettes.

Using a modified nominal group approach (Bowling, 1997), participants were asked to read
the vignettes carefully and to decide, first individually and then in their small groups,
where they believed each depicted person would be most appropriately cared for ­ their
own home, ECH (for older people generally or dementia specific) or a care home (for
older people generally or dementia specific, with or without nursing). Still in their small
groups, participants then chose case types for whom they felt care at home or in ECH was
a realistic proposition, and specified the care services and professional support needed to
achieve this. For the purposes of this exercise, participants were asked to put aside any
short-term constraints in current services (including the then lack of ECH specifically
dedicated for people with dementia) and to think creatively, whilst remembering that all
provision inevitably has funding implications. A list of services available in other parts of
the country was provided to facilitate this activity, and a comprehensive costing approach
was subsequently used to estimate the weekly costs of the proposed community care
packages.
Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the recommendations for each case type
(vignette), and modelling was employed to illuminate the decision-making process. The
decisions of individual practitioners and small groups formed the analysis dataset, and a
multinomial logistic regression was undertaken to explore the factors associated with the
choices made.
Strand 2. Simulated resource allocation management panel. The identification of
care home entrants for whom ECH could be more appropriate: social care
managers' views
Details of the case types for whom practitioner groups recommended community care (in-
cluding ECH) were presented at a specially convened meeting of the Site X Resource
Allocation Management (RAM) Panel in November 2011. This was composed of three
senior social care managers who acted as gatekeepers for access to long-term care home

proposed alternative support arrangements were: (i) appropriate; (ii) sufficient to enable the
depicted individuals to remain in the community; and (iii) fundable.
This exercise took the form of an in-vivo simulation of a normal RAM Panel meeting and
utilised local proformas containing information on:

Box 1. An example of a vignette, Mrs E living with dementia.
Mrs E
Sociodemographic information
Mrs E is an 80-year-old lady who usually lives with her husband. She is currently an inpatient at the
district general hospital where she has been treated for a urinary tract infection and delirium.
Information about care needs:
1. Activities of daily living: Mrs E is very active and has no problems mobilising in or outdoors. She
is, however, occasionally incontinent of urine. Whilst she can wash, dress and feed herself, she
needs much encouragement to change her clothes (which she often sleeps in) and can rarely be
persuaded to have a bath. She looks tired and dishevelled.
2. Physical health: Mrs E is prone to urinary tract infections and takes medication for high blood
pressure. Her physical health is otherwise very good.
3. Cognition/mood: Mrs E was diagnosed with vascular dementia two years ago, now moderate in
degree. Whilst she has obvious short-term memory problems and frequently struggles to express
herself, her family can generally understand what she says. There is no indication that she is depressed.
4. Behaviour: Mrs E appears restless and agitated. She repeatedly picks at her clothing and spends
much time walking around the ward with a purposeful stride. Indeed, on two occasions she has left
the ward without detection. Whilst she is not usually physically aggressive, she often becomes
angry when offered personal care and has on occasion spat at staff. She sleeps poorly and is now
cared for in a single room because she was disturbing other patients at night. This behaviour is not
new, and mirrors that she displayed at home.
Current care:
1. Informal support: Mrs E's main carer is her husband, who is himself 85 years old. In recent years,
he has undertaken all the household tasks, including shopping, cooking and cleaning, and has pro-
vided a high degree of support for his wife. His daughter and granddaughter are also supportive, but
all three feel that they have reached their limit in caring for Mrs E at home.
2. Formal care package: Mrs E is well known to her the local social services team but has never
received a formal care package, having resisted any external help. The community mental health
team are also involved and, prior to Mrs E's current admission, were trying to persuade her to
accept day care.
Assessment issues:
1. Risk factors: Mrs E is a fit and active lady who needs constant supervision. In the last few months,
there have been a number of occasions on which she has left her home unobserved, and whilst she
does not usually get very far, her husband has twice had to involve the police. Both he and his family
are clearly very stressed by the prospect of Mrs E returning home.
2. Attitude to future care. Mrs E herself is adamant that she wants to return home and that she
does not need any help. It is not thought she has the capacity to make an informed decision about
the future however.

dementia specific) including the cost to social services; and
· The alternative community care packages proposed by practitioners, including the esti-
mated cost to social services.
With the participants' consent, the RAM Panel discussion was audio-recorded, and the
transcript was professionally transcribed. A framework approach was used to manage and
interpret the data (Ritchie & Spencer, 1994; Spencer, Ritchie, O'Connor, Morrell, &
Ormston, 2014). This matrix-based system was developed to support thematic analysis
and involves a series of stages to familiarise, sort, index and summarise data, allowing
movement between levels of abstraction, whilst staying close to the original material.
Data are summarised by both case and subtheme facilitating cross and within case analysis.
Three authors (HV, ST, MA) undertook this task individually, with later discussion to
challenge and refine themes and build understanding and consensus, a method that was
both iterative and comprehensive.
Strand 3. Real life care home applications: Reasons for not considering ECH
Free text information on the reasons why ECH was not considered suitable for actual care
home entrants, the vast majority of whom had significant cognitive impairment or dementia,
was extracted from real life (anonymised) care home application proformas (n ¼ 61) com-
pleted by care co-ordinators and presented to the RAM Panel over a three-month period in
2010. Coding used conventional content analysis (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). This
derives themes/categories directly from the data at hand (avoiding the use of preconceived
categories), making it an appropriate approach for exploratory analyses (Hsieh & Shannon,
2005). Interpretation was limited to manifest content, i.e. which is visible and obvious
(Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). Two researchers (HV and ST) independently analysed
the data to identify basic codes, which were subsequently grouped into broader categories
and refined and compared in discussion with a third team member (MW).
Ethics
Ethical approval for the study as a whole was granted by the then Cambridgeshire 3
Research Ethics Committee (reference number 10/H0306/51) and research governance pro-
cedures in each participating organisation were fulfilled.
Results
Strand 1. Care planning workshop. Identification of care home entrants for whom ECH
could be more appropriate: Frontline staff's recommendations
Of the 169 care home entrants, just over half were !85 and 68% were female. Although the
vast majority had previously lived at home (8% lived in ECH), most were admitted to a care
home directly from hospital (49% from a general ward and 9% from a psychiatric ward).
Approximately two-thirds had at least medium ADL dependency; more than four-fifths had
medium or high levels of cognitive impairment; and a still higher proportion presented with
Verbeek et al. 7
medium or high levels of challenging behaviour. Full details of the study sample are avail-
able elsewhere (Challis et al., 2014).
Of the 27 case types used to characterise the care home entrants, 23 were populated. As
would be expected, some combinations of characteristics were more prevalent than others,
and in combination the 14 vignettes represented 77% of the sample (see Table 2). Nine of
the vignettes depicted people with a formal diagnosis of dementia, whilst three others
depicted people with some degree of cognitive impairment (including memory loss, disori-
entation to time and word-finding difficulties). The remaining two had no significant cog-
nitive impairment, but had marked anxiety or depression.
As noted, 17 (frontline and managerial) staff participated in the care-planning workshop,
and each of the 14 vignettes was considered by at least six individuals (maximum 11).
Mental health nurses were the most frequently represented discipline, but other participants
included social work and housing staff. Altogether, individual participants made a total of
102 recommendations, of which 37 were for ECH ­ 23 for ECH for older people generally
and 14 for dementia-specific ECH (see Table 3). Indeed, at least one individual recom-
mended ECH for 12 of the 14 case types.
Fourteen alternative care plans were formulated by the multidisciplinary groups, of
which seven identified ECH as the most appropriate care setting (see Table 3). These
pertained to six case types, of which three represented people with a formal diagnosis of
dementia and two represented people with evident cognitive impairment.
Multinomial logistic regression analyses of recommendations of individual practitioners
found that previous receipt of social care and being in hospital on assessment increased the
likelihood that ECH would be seen as more appropriate than care at home. ECH was not
recommended for those individuals who needed care at night. A high level of ADL needs,
the lack of capacity to make an informed decision about future care, the previous receipt of

social care and if people were previously admitted to an inpatient ward increased the like-
lihood that care home placement would be favoured over care at home. Neither living alone
nor the need for care at night influenced the recommendation of care home entry (Table 4).
Strand 2. Simulated resource allocation management panel. The identification of care
home entrants for whom ECH could be more appropriate: view of social care managers
When presented with the details of the five care home case types with dementia/evident cog-
nitive impairment for which the staff groups recommended ECH, the RAM Panel supported
ECH for just one (case type 22). Furthermore, the home of the individual depicted in this case
was described as physically unsuitable to meet their needs, meaning a change of residence was
(at least in the short-term) inevitable. In each other case, the Panel favoured care at home.
Five main themes relating to the rejection of ECH as the most appropriate care setting
were identified from the RAM Panel discussion: (1) the desire to support people at home
wherever possible; (2) the wish to support individuals' preferences; (3) the need to avoid
potentially disruptive moves; (4) uncertainty about at what stage in the care pathway ECH
was most appropriate for people with dementia and (5) the lack of sufficient information to
justify such a move.
Perhaps, the most pervasive of these was the Panel's strong desire to support people with
dementia at home wherever possible for as long as possible (taking into account the risks the
person would face in doing so). `Our key brief and our key principle is that we will always
try and support somebody in their own home'.
When considering whether a proposed move to ECH was appropriate for a particular
person, for example, the Panel often started by asking whether or not the individual had
any needs that could not be met at home, or whether all home care options had been
`exhausted': `I suppose from my perspective just before we got to this level [ECH] I suppose
we're looking to see what additional support can we provide within the home. . .' (Case type
9). `What would extra care housing give her that we couldn't provide by enhancing her care
package?' (Case type 17).

Second, whilst staying in one's own home appeared to be seen as a `good' in itself, the
desire to support the person's wishes was often cited in support of their decision: `You
know, if somebody was really keen on returning home and wanting to stay there and
that was their wishes, then we'd look to support those' (Case type 22).
However, analysis suggested that where individuals (or more often their family) felt they
couldn't remain at home and/or expressed fears about their ability to cope, the Panel's initial
response was still to see if they could address/overcome these issues by providing more
support at home. Talking about the situation of Mrs E in Box 1, for example, for whom
they were inclined to provide support at home, they noted that:
It doesn't say anywhere in here that the husband or the family are saying that actually with
additional support they feel they would, . . . be able to support her at home. So I mean, realis-
tically, that's a piece of work that really does have to be undertaken before you go anywhere
because they're saying they're at their limit. (Case type 9)
A third theme captured the Panel's desire to avoid a change of residence for older people
with dementia on the basis that moving was a major upheaval, could potentially make
people less independent (e.g. increase disorientation) and may, if the individual's condi-
tion subsequently deteriorated, be for a short-period only: `Maybe the issue around
prognosis does come into it somewhere in terms of presumably she might not want
another change of accommodation. If that was unclear. . . I think that would be key
to it, wouldn't it. . .' (Case type 13). `That's always a quandary. . . for someone to move,
to then possibly find themselves in a position in 8/10 months' time of having to move
again. . .' (Case type 17).
Indeed, identifying the optimal time to move to ECH was identified as a fourth theme of
itself, and seemed to pose the Panel something of a quandary, as whilst they considered that
older people with dementia would be more likely to adapt to ECH if they moved at a
relatively early stage in their illness (the long-term perspective), they also wished to prevent
any unnecessary moves (the short-term perspective) and were concerned that people may
subsequently need to move into a care home (the long-term perspective):
Looking at placements for extra care at an earlier point is sometimes more useful for people
because it gives an opportunity to orientate, but then you're left with the dilemma of will it
ultimately still lead to a place in a residential home in which case you've had several moves. And
I suppose on that basis you do try to support people as long as possible as well at home. . . so
you've got sometimes a bit of a dilemma. (general discussion)
Fifth, a lack of information about the person's situation (with too many issues not clarified)
or the possibility that the person's mental or physical health might improve, was also often
given as a reason for preferring to support a person at home, at least in the short-term:
Clearly this lady is at the moment in hospital. She's got a urinary tract infection sort of over-
laying on her diagnosis anyway of vascular dementia. . . This lady will need some time, and in
terms of . . . her behaviour, you know, perhaps situational. . . (Case type 9)
By way of contrast, the Panel's arguments in favour of ECH largely related to its ability to
alleviate social isolation or mitigate risk, albeit they did not appear entirely convinced of
10 Dementia 0(0)
this. Thus, although they stated that ECH could offer `extra reassurance that there is some-
body around if needed' (Case type 13), they also noted that it could `be fairly isolating for
some people' (Case type 2) and typically looked to meet people's need for social contact in
different ways, including the provision of regular home and day care.
Strand 3. Reasons for not considering ECH in actual care home applications
The reasons care coordinators (frontline practitioners) gave for not considering ECH for
actual care home entrants fell into five main categories: the extent of care the person needed;
the level of individuals' needs; the perceived inability of ECH to maintain people's safety;
the desire to respect the individual's (or family's) wishes; and the previous, unsuccessful trial
of ECH.
The first and most common of these (noted in 42 applications) concerned the extent of the
care the person needed, which was perceived to exceed that available in ECH. This was
expressed in several different ways. For instance, many care co-ordinators highlighted the
frequency of care service users required, including the need for `care throughout the 24 hour
period' or `24 hour supervision', whilst eight applications stated that the person needed
somebody with them at all times to prevent them becoming distressed. Other applications
rather emphasised the degree of care the person required (e.g. needs two carers and hoisting)
or the fact that care inputs could not be regularly scheduled (e.g. ECH would not be a viable
option. . . due to the unpredictability of his toileting needs), whilst the need for care at night or
nursing care were also seen as prohibitive.
Coming at this in a different way, in 27 cases care coordinators emphasised the level of
individuals' needs (the second category), arguing that these were too severe/complex to be
met in ECH. In some cases, no further detail was given. However, many applications made
reference to specific psychological or behavioural concerns, predominantly people's levels of
cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression. In one instance, for example, ECH was
deemed unsuitable because of the person's `agitated state and verbal aggression', whilst in
another instance, it was stated that the individual's `level of disorientation' made ECH in-
appropriate. By contrast, only two applications referred to the extent of people's physical
needs.
Related to the above, a third category concerned the perceived inability of ECH to
maintain people's safety. This was mentioned in 15 applications, with ECH seen as partic-
ularly inappropriate for people at risk of falls. However, the same argument was sometimes
made for people reported to wander.
The fourth set of reasons related to the older person's or family's wishes, which were
mentioned in connection with 17 applications. Some of these were linked to the person's
aforementioned level of needs. However, a more common scenario was that the person had
been temporarily placed in a care home in response to a crisis, and had since settled, such
that they/their family or staff were reluctant to consider another move. Frequently, how-
ever, no explanation was given other than that the person or their relatives did not want to
consider ECH.
Finally, in a handful of cases, ECH was said to have been tried and unsuccessful (n ¼ 3),
or unavailable (n ¼ 3), there no suitable schemes within the area the person wanted to live in
or no vacant flats at the right time.

Discussion
This study provides new insight into views of frontline practitioners (including care coor-
dinators) and social care managers on the appropriate use of ECH for older people with
mental health problems and identifies potential barriers to its greater employment. As in-
dicated in the first strand of the results from the care planning workshop, frontline staff
viewed ECH as a valuable alternative to care home placement for a significant minority of
current care home entrants, particularly people with a formal diagnosis of dementia or
evident cognitive problems who lived alone. However, ECH was not recommended for
people who needed care at night. Indeed, the third strand of the results, the analysis of
real care home applications, showed that the need for more care (and in particular more
frequent ­ often 24 hour ­ care) than was perceived to be available was given as a reason for
not considering ECH in more than two-thirds of actual care home applications. In contrast,
the second strand of the findings, the analysis of the RAM Panel meeting, revealed that
social care managers appeared overwhelmingly focused on maintaining people at home, and
saw few if any advantages to ECH for the presented case types, despite expressing general
support for this form of housing.
Looking across the different datasets, this study indicates a lack of clarity as to the place
of ECH in the care spectrum, which may prevent its wider development for people with
dementia. On the one hand, when asked to state why ECH was not appropriate for actual
care home entrants in the third strand of the study, frontline staff suggested it did not
provide sufficient care, arguing that individuals' needs were too high to be met in such
facilities. This would appear to indicate that they saw its place in the care spectrum as
close to care at home. On the other hand, when asked to identify the most appropriate
care option for certain current care home entrants in the first strand of the study, social care
managers typically argued that the individuals' needs did not warrant ECH. This might
seem to suggest that they would perceive it as closer to care home entry. As indicated in the
introduction, however, studies suggest that ECH can enable older people to lead fulfilling
lives in an environment that is widely perceived to be less restrictive than many care homes
(Callaghan & Towers, 2014; Demos, 2014). Further, the limited evidence available from
similar, homelike residential models in other countries suggests that residents' satisfaction
with care is high in such environments (Ausserhofer et al., 2016; Verbeek et al., 2009).
Together, this might encourage social care staff to view ECH as a discrete alternative to
both of these environments.
Another important finding from this study highlights a lack of consensus about the
point on the care pathway at which ECH is most appropriate for people with dementia,
with different staff placing different weights on different arguments. These include the
belief that people with dementia are more able to adapt to a change of residence early in
the care pathway; the likelihood that a change of residence will create major stress and a
potential deterioration in functioning and the assumption that a move to ECH will not
be for life. The latter, in particular, appeared to be an important obstacle to the greater
use of ECH in this study. However, internationally, other small-scale, homelike care
models have developed to support very highly dependent people, sometimes in close
relation with other assisted living facilities (Verbeek et al., 2009; Wimo & Morthenson
Ekel
of, 2004), and it might be argued that given the flexible care available, residents
should be able to stay in ECH as their needs progress. More research is needed to
investigate whether these expectations can be met over time. Further, whilst frontline
12 Dementia 0(0)
practitioners tended to consider ECH inappropriate for older people who needed fre-
quent care or supervision or posed potential risks, particularly in relation to falls, wheth-
er care homes can minimise these risks to a greater extent than ECH and are better
placed to provide 24-hour care is a moot point. There is certainly some evidence that
care homes find it difficult to meet the needs of people with complex, unpredictable
needs, and that sufficient time and prerequisite skills among care home staff may be
lacking (Robbins, Gordon, Dyas, Logan, & Gladman, 2013). Moreover, whereas care
homes in some other countries employ their own specialised medical staff, facilitating the
care of people with greater needs (Conroy et al., 2009), in the UK, medical responsibility
for both ECH and most care home residents is held by general practitioners (GPs).
Finally, interestingly, this study found no evidence that costs were a key factor in driving
staff decision making, with there being minimal reference to costs in any of the three strands.
Previous evidence has suggested that ECH can be a cost-effective alternative to care home
admission (B
aumker et al., 2010) and it may be that the participating staff were aware of
this. Alternatively, it may be that other reasons, such as the desire to support people at home
were perceived as more important. Indeed, as noted above, particularly for the RAM Panel,
this desire appeared to override any other concern, including on occasion older people's and
families' preferences.
Limitations and strengths
A major strength of the current study is its use of both quantitative and qualitative methods.
The materials used in the care planning workshop drew on a rich dataset of current care
home residents' characteristics at the precise time of care home admission. It facilitated the
construction of representative case types whose care needs were explored using a modified
nominal group approach, whilst the in vivo RAM panel exercise and the analysis of real life
care home applications supplied rich data on the factors underlying both managers' and
frontline practitioners' decision making. Nevertheless, four key limitations must be ac-
knowledged. First, the research was conducted in just one area of the UK, which may
limit generalisability of results. For example, the limited extent to which social care man-
agers' regarded ECH as a valuable alternative to care home admission could be a local
effect. Second, although there were several ECH facilities in the study site, none of these
were dedicated for people with dementia. Whilst the focus of the study was on the services
needed by people with dementia, as opposed to the services available, it is possible that the
participants in the first two strands of the study (the care planning workshop and simulated
RAM Panel) may have over- or under-estimated what such facilities can offer. Third, the
study focused solely on staff views and did not directly involve older people with mental
health problems or their carers themselves, albeit information on their preferences was
included in the vignettes. Fourth, the issue of ownership (i.e. whether people's previous
housing was privately owned or rented) was not considered in the decision about different
ECH options.
Conclusion
This study provides new understanding of perspectives of frontline practitioner' and social
care managers on the appropriate use of ECH for people with dementia. Whilst social care
managers' appeared overwhelmingly focused on maintaining people at home, frontline
Verbeek et al. 13
practitioners viewed ECH as a valuable alternative to care home placement. More empirical
evidence is needed on whether, for whom and in what circumstances ECH provides a pref-
erable alternative for people with dementia, including the views of users' themselves. In the
meantime, local care planners and commissioners could investigate whether the concerns
and reservations about the use of ECH identified above are mirrored in their locality and
consider the potential utility of alternative supported housing models from other countries.
