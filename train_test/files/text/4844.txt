Abstract: Humans have engaged in unique cooperative breeding insofar as multiple
in-group members help mothers. Two psychological-proximate factors maintain such a
breeding system--various individuals' interest in infants and mothers' positive reactions
toward individuals approaching their infants--which we investigated in the present study.
In Study 1, we conducted field observations to examine the first factor: what types of
passersby in Japan reacted to the mother and infant. This replicated studies conducted in
Western countries more than 30 years ago, allowing for the examination of the influence of
culture and time. The results confirmed the differences among age groups in frequency of
looking at mother and infant, and predicted its universality, especially the rise in older
adults. The sex difference was not significant. In Study 2, we gathered data via
questionnaires and interviews using hypothetical scenarios to investigate the second factor:
how mothers felt when their infants were approached by strangers. The results revealed that
mothers received strangers' approaches positively. The present study showed that humans
engaged in unique cooperative breeding in the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness
(EEA), where mothers in modern society see strangers as potential helpers as part of the
EEA.

Introduction
Human infants are born helpless, with large brains and a slow growth rate. Unlike

other animals, infants need care long after they have been weaned. Nevertheless, mothers
often raise multiple children due to their short birth interval. Such a high breeding rate is
supported by help from others (Hrdy, 2009). That is, humans have evolved a breeding
system in which group members other than the genetic parents (i.e., alloparents) frequently
help the parents rear their offspring (Hrdy, 2005). One unique point in humans is that
multiple individuals contribute to childcare--male and female kin and non-kin ranging
from juveniles to older adults (Kramer, 2010)--because human society consists of many
unrelated group members (Hill et al., 2011). As a result, child rearing still naturally causes
social interaction in modern society. In fact, Wood, Giles-Corti, Zubrick, and Bulsara
(2013) revealed that child rearing influenced broad social interactions, community
participation, and social capital in neighborhoods.
Such a cooperative breeding system is maintained by two psychological-proximate
factors. The first is the interest in infants presented by non-parent individuals. Generally,
primates are attracted to infants (Hrdy, 2009). However, in non-cooperative breeding
species, such as Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) or chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),
the individuals showing the highest interest in infants are restricted in young nulliparous
females (Hiraiwa, 1981; Nishida, 1983). This tendency is also seen in species showing
alloparenting, such as Hanuman langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) (Hrdy, 1976) or Vervet
monkeys (Cevcopithecus aethiops) (Lancaster, 1971). On the other hand, in common
marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus), which breed
cooperatively, motivation toward parenting is not limited to young nulliparous females but
is shown by other group members as well (Saito, Izumi, and Nakamura, 2011; Zahed,
Kurian, and Snowdon, 2010).
With regard to studies on humans, Maestripieri and Pelka (2002) examined sex
differences regarding interest in infants across the lifespan and showed that preferences for
infant silhouettes over those of adults decreased steadily with age in women. The authors
explained their findings from an evolutionary perspective: Young girls show interest in
infants to learn caretaking skills, as has been shown in other primates. Contrasting results
were yielded by observational studies. One version of such studies was the waiting room
experiment. In these studies, responsiveness to a live infant in the waiting room was
examined (Feldman and Nash, 1978, 1979a, 1979b; Feldman, Nash, and Cutrona, 1977;
Nash and Feldman, 1980). In another version, passersby looking, smiling at, and talking to
an adult and an infant (Schleidt, Schiefenhvel, Stanjek, and Krell, 1980) or simply looking
at them (Robinson, Lockard, and Adams, 1979) were analyzed in the field. These studies
revealed that minors and older adults reacted more to the infant than middle-aged people
did, and a sex difference was observed as women showed more frequent reactions.
Although methodological differences may explain the variation between the
preference experiment and these observation studies, it is of primary importance to an
investigation of responses to infant stimuli that we consider the human society and
cooperative breeding system mentioned above. Differing from other primates, many
unrelated people compose a community, and multiple in-group members, including non-kin
individuals, take part in child rearing. Furthermore, some biases concerning responsiveness
toward infants might be predicted as follows from the viewpoint of the Environment of
Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA). The EEA is conceptualized as the conditions
encountered by ancestors that could impact their fitness, dictating the development of their
psychological mechanisms (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). Hunter-gatherer societies today
Human cooperative breeding

are often referred to as examples, suggesting the sexual division of labor: men's major role
in hunting and women's in gathering and childcare (Lancaster and Kaplan, 2009). It is
possible that women are more responsive in the area of childcare because they were more
likely to be with the infants of their community than men. Although, as Maestripieri and
Pelka (2002) indicated, young girls should be motivated to learn caretaking skills, people in
the post-reproductive stage--especially women who are skilled--could afford to mind
other infants. In fact, Ivey (2000) revealed that, in Efé foragers, people without dependent
offspring were more likely to engage in alloparenting. These aspects may explain people's
reactions to infants in observational studies.
The second psychological-proximate factor promoting a cooperative breeding
system in humans is mothers' positive reactions toward individuals approaching their
infants. In non-cooperative breeding primates, mothers restrict other individuals' access to
their infants to avoid abuse or kidnapping (Hrdy, 1976; Nicolson, 1987; Onishi and
Nakamichi, 2011). In contrast, mothers in species such as langurs, who have been seen
alloparenting, are tolerant of others' eagerness to approach their infants; however, "others"
may be defined as kin individuals to whom mothers could commit their infants (Hrdy, 2005,
2009). Mothers of marmosets also let other family members carry their infants (Box, 1977;
Mills, Windle, Baker, and Ridley, 2004). Differing from other apes, human mothers do
permit others to approach or hold their infants (Hrdy, 2009). Since humans are engaged in
cooperative breeding among various in-group members, it is expected that mothers will
receive interest from others positively, regardless of whether they are kin or non-kin.
Therefore, we should explore the phenomenon of infants as attention catchers from the
view point of mothers. In relation to this, no previous studies have addressed how mothers
feel when people approach them and their infants, instead focusing solely on people's
reactions toward their infants.
Modern society is far different from the EEA. However, the human mind today
should show signs of traits adapted to the EEA, because their brains could not catch up
with the extremely changed environment. In the EEA, people would have lived mostly in
small face-to-face communities (Cosmides and Tooby, 2013). On the other hand, in
modern society, people have the chance to see many unfamiliar people every day.
Traditionally, in-group members are perceived positively (Brewer, 1979), whereas
strangers are perceived as out-group members who humans innately fear. This is the case
for strange males, who threatened children and adults in the evolutionary past
(Hahn-Holbrook, Holbrook, and Bering, 2010). If modern mothers are receptive to
strangers who show positive response toward the mother and infants, it is unlikely that they
perceive strangers according to the EEA. Instead, it is possible that they see these
strangers' approaches as a sign of potential help from in-group members, as a result of a
disparity between the EEA and modern society.
In order to investigate these two psychological factors reflected in people today, in
the present study we examine what kinds of people are attracted by infants in the field and
how mothers feel about these approaches by strangers toward them and their infants. In this
study, we defined strangers' reactions as follows: their looking as attention, and their
smiling and talking as approaches. Baby schema (Kindchenschema), or infantile features
suggested by Lorenz (1943), attracts attention (Brosch, Sander, and Scherer, 2007; Brosch,
Sander, Pourtois, and Scherer, 2008) and leads to the perception of cuteness and motivation
toward caretaking (Glocker et al., 2009), according to visual stimulus-based experiments.
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -473-
Therefore, looking (representing attention), smiling (that occurs after looking, as a reaction
to infants) (Hildebrandt and Fitzgerald, 1978; Schleidt et al., 1980), and talking (indicating
actual interaction), are indicators of caretaking behavior.
In Study 1, we conducted field experiments to observe the reactions of passersby to
a mother and an infant. Although similar studies have been conducted in the U.S.
(Robinson et al., 1979), and in Germany and Italy (Schleidt et al., 1980)--which reported
the presence of sex and age differences as women, minors, and older adults showed more
frequent reactions--no study seems to have examined this phenomenon in a non-Western
culture. Japanese pedestrians were found to react less to a stranger with smiles, nods, and
greetings than Americans do (Patterson et al., 2007). Hence, this examination was needed
to reveal whether the findings of Robinson et al. (1979) or Schleidt et al. (1980) were
culturally universal or specific; in particular, smiling at or talking to a mother and an infant,
as seen in the study of Schleidt et al. (1980).
Robinson et al. (1979), who conducted observations with both mother-infant and
father-infant pairs, stated that a replication of their study 20 years later might yield different
results due to changes of opinion on traditional sex roles. However, no replication has yet
been conducted in the more than 30 years since their study, with the exception of Schleidt
et al.'s (1980) study, which was undertaken independently at the same time. Although the
present study was conducted with only mother-infant pairs, this is a replication in a
different culture and time from previous studies.
In Study 2, we used questionnaires and interviews presenting a hypothetical
scenario to mothers with infants in order to examine how they feel when a stranger
approaches them. Cooperative breeding systems should require a mother's permission for
an individual to approach their infant. In fact, mothers in cooperative breeding species are
tolerant toward potential helpers to handle the infants (Hrdy, 2009). Potential helpers in
humans of in-group members include non-kin individuals (Kramer, 2010). In
hunter-gatherer societies, mothers let anyone come near or hold their baby (Hrdy, 2009). If
mothers show their tolerance to certain individuals, this would indicate that mothers
recognize them as potential helpers. Emotions adjust physiological, psychological, and
behavioral responses (Nesse, 1990); subsequently, mothers' feelings predict whether
permissive behavior can follow.
Study 1: Observation
Study 1 was conducted to observe and examine the characteristics of those
passersby who reacted to the mother and infant in the field experiment. We expected that
our results would ascertain the kinds of people who are likely to take part in cooperative
breeding, replicating the results of prior studies (Robinson et al., 1979; Schleidt et al.,
1980). Therefore, the first hypothesis was that female passersby would react more than
male passersby to the mother and infant. The second hypothesis was that minors and older
adults would react more than middle-aged people would.
Materials and Methods
Confederates
Eleven pairs of mothers (28­35 years old) and their infants (4 boys and 7 girls;
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -474-
5­25 months old) served as confederates. We recruited the confederates through
acquaintances. Each mother confederate was instructed in advance on how to behave
during the experiment (See Procedure).
This study was approved by the psychological research ethics committees at the
College of Contemporary Psychology of Rikkyo University. We obtained prior consent and
parental consent from all confederates.
Setting
The experiments were conducted at five 4­7 meter-wide sidewalk locations in
Tokyo and Saitama prefectures. These locations were selected based on confederates'
residences. Observations were carried out during the day on sunny or cloudy days between
July and November 2012. The temperature ranged from 8­30 °C during the observations.
Participants
Individuals passing the sidewalk observation points were regarded as participants.
Participants were restricted to those walking in the direction with heavier traffic at the
beginning of each experiment. When many individuals passed the observation point
simultaneously, the nearest pedestrian to the confederates was designated as the participant.
People who were running, wearing sunglasses, a mask, or a sun visor were excluded as
participants, as were infants being held or pushed in strollers. Individuals who talked to a
confederate were added as participants unless they were existing participants' companions.
Procedure
Each pair of confederates spent 30 minutes in the experiment. Additionally, mother
confederates spent 30 minutes alone for the baseline measurement. The two conditions
were conducted in randomized order. Details of the experiments are illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Illustration of Study 1 procedure
Note: When both the mother and the infant confederates sat on the bench, the mother sat behind the infant
to be seen from the direction the observation was being conducted. The observer was 1.5­4 m in front of
the confederates in the direction of the participants passing through. She began to observe the participant
from the time he or she reached 2 m before the confederates and stopped when the participant passed the
confederates.
Confederates remained at the observation point beside the sidewalk. If the infant
left the observation point, observation was suspended, and the mother confederate
Human cooperative breeding

reclaimed the infant without force. In the event that the infant left and remained at other
locations near the sidewalk, the observation was resumed at that location. The mother
confederates were instructed to behave naturally in both conditions and to maintain a free
physical posture, such as sitting on a bench or standing by the sidewalk. If the infant could
not yet walk unassisted, the confederate could choose to hold the infant in her arms or place
him or her in a stroller. When both the mother and the infant sat on the bench, the mother
sat behind the infant so that it could be seen from the direction from which the observation
was being conducted. The confederates were allowed to read books, eat, drink, use mobile
phones except to make a call, and play with toys that were unlikely to attract attention.
They were instructed to behave as usual when a participant talked to them and not to talk
until they were spoken to.
Traffic dropped remarkably during the mother-and-infant condition for one pair of
confederates shortly after the experiment began. Observation was suspended 15 minutes
after the start time and resumed at another location, where the remainder of the mother and
infant period and the full baseline observation were carried out.
The observer was 1.5­4 m in front of the confederates in the direction of
participants passing through. She began to observe the participant from the time he or she
reached 2 m before the confederates and stopped when the participant passed the
confederates, then recorded the content of the observation on a data sheet within 5 s.
The data recorded included the participants' characteristics and observed reactions
to the confederates. Participant characteristics recorded were sex and age group. We
estimated the age group in the following five groups from the perspective of life history,
referring to a 2012 children and childcare white paper (Cabinet office, Government of
Japan, 2012): under 12, 13­18, 19­29, 30­49, and over 50. Participants' observed reactions
were recorded according to three categories--looking, smiling, and talking--which were
used by the replicated study (Schleidt et al., 1980). "Looking" was defined as looking at the
confederates for at least 2 s, referring to the study of Robinson et al. (1979), although
looking was treated as gazing for even less than 2 s in the study of Schleidt et al. (1980),
who used a video camera to record. "Smiling" was defined as looking and smiling.
In order to verify inter-rater reliability, Cohen's kappa coefficients (Cohen, 1960)
were calculated for three sets of observations conducted by two independent observers.
Prior to the experiments, the observers practiced with and without a confederate (female
undergraduate student), in particular for the accurate estimation of age group and presence
of looking by passersby. Kappa coefficients of the three set of observations were .77 for
age group, .62 for looking, and .82 for smiling at the confederates. Values of .61 or more
are significant Kappa coefficient (Landis and Koch, 1977). Therefore, the estimations were
regarded as reliable, despite the use of constructed age groups, as opposed to real ones.
Mother confederates were given a checklist and asked that when they were talked to
during the experiment, to check off items on the list to record what they talked about. The
list items were as follows: (a) about the infant confederate, (b) about the mother
confederate, (c) about the participant's child or grandchild, (d) greetings, and (e) other
topics. The mother confederates were directed to classify statements, such as "He is cute"
or "How old is he?" as talk about the infant confederates; a topic like childcare would
pertain to the mother confederates. The checklist included space for each item to record
whether the mother or the infant confederate was addressed. The mother confederates were
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -476-
also asked to record the sex of the participant who talked to them in order to identify the
participant recorded by the observer.
Results
The number of participants in each trial ranged from 14 to 99. In our analysis, all 11
sets of data were integrated into the data for either the mother-and-infant condition or the
baseline. Although 951 people were observed across trials, 14 were excluded from the
analysis because of operational errors. The final total number of participants was 937 (490
in the mother-and-infant condition and 447 in the baseline). Details of the participants and
their observed reactions are shown in Table 1. Almost all the participants were judged as
Japanese; approximately 2% appeared to be non-Japanese, but these did not exhibit any
observed reaction.

The software R 3.0.2 (R Core Team, 2013) was used for the statistical analysis.
Independent variables were the sex and age group of the participant; dependent variables
were the percentages of observed reactions. We applied the statistical analysis only to the
mother-and-infant condition.
Using the "Anova" function of the R-package "car" (Fox and Weisberg, 2011), we
applied a likelihood ratio test. The interaction of sex and age groups had no significant
effect on looking, 2(4) = 8.28, p = .08. In the model excluding interaction, sex did not have
a significant effect, 2(1) = 0.03, p = .86, but age groups did, 2(4) = 24.38, p < .001. The
percentages of each category classified by sex and age group are illustrated in Figure 2.

Note: All 11 sets of data were integrated and then categorized according to sex and age group. A
likelihood ratio test indicated that there were no significant effect on sex, nor was there a significant
interaction on sex and age group. Age group had a significant effect.
For smiling, we examined the data of participants who looked at the confederates (n
= 81). The data showed that 17 participants smiled at confederates. The interaction of sex
and age group had no significant effect, 2(3) = 5.39, p = .15. In the model excluding
interaction, sex had a significant effect, 2(1) = 4.47, p < .05, indicating that women smiled
more often than men. However, age groups did not have a significant effect, 2(4) = 1.97, p
= .74.
Talking was observed in only six cases in the mother-and-infant condition. This
category was not examined with a statistical test because of the small number of
observations. Table 2 shows participants' characteristics and the type of talk recorded by
the mother confederates. The participant in case 1 was accompanied by an infant. In case 5,
the participant was accompanied by three men who appeared to be in the same age group as
the participant (19­29). Two of the three companions (companion A and companion B)
also talked to the confederates. Companion A greeted the infant and talked to the mother
confederate about the infant and the confederate herself. Companion B talked to the mother
confederate about the infant and greeted the infant.

Study 2: Questionnaire and Interview
In Study 2-1, we administered a questionnaire to mothers based on a hypothetical
scenario, asking their feelings about being smiled at or talked to by a stranger. The feelings
were rated on a scale ranging from pleasant to unpleasant. The scenarios of Study 2-1 were
composed of three conditions--Alone, With-Another-Adult, and With-Own-Infant--so
that we could compare mothers' feelings according to the conditions and examine the
influence of the infant's presence. In Study 2-2, a semi-structured interview was conducted
with participants independent of the questionnaire. In the interview, we asked participants
about their feelings in the above situations and related items and classified the answers.
Study 2-1: Questionnaire
Materials and Methods
Participants
We distributed the questionnaire to 40 mothers living in Tokyo who had children
0­5 years old; responses were obtained from 28 (response rate: 70%; mean age: 37.7,
range: 29­45 years, SD: 4.27). The participants were those of an unrelated study in the area
of developmental psychology. Participants expressed their interest in response to notices on
bulletin boards at places frequented by children or families in Tokyo.
This study was approved by the psychological research ethics committees at the
College of Contemporary Psychology of Rikkyo University.
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -479-
Procedure
There were six questions for the hypothetical scenario: 3 (condition: Alone,
With-Another-Adult, With-Own-Infant) × 2 (type of reaction by strangers: Smiled-At,
Talked-To). For example, "How do you feel about being smiled at by a stranger when you
are out alone?" The full form of the questionnaire is shown in Appendix 1.
The participant was asked to choose an answer for each question from 1
(unpleasant) to 5 (pleasant).
Results
An analysis of variance (ANOVA, using SPSS version 20) showed a significant
main effect of condition. F(1.52, 40.98) = 34.95, p < .001 (see Figure 3), and multiple
comparisons indicated that the With-Own-Infant condition scored higher than the Alone or
With-Another-Adult conditions at the 0.1% level; no significant difference was found
between the Alone and With-Another-Adult conditions. There was a significant main effect
of the type of reaction: The Talked-To reaction scored lower than the Smiled-At reaction,
F(1, 27) = 5.99, p < .05. An interaction of condition and type of reaction was not
significant, F(2, 54) = 2.84, n.s..

Study 2-2: Interview
Materials and Methods
Participants
Study 2-2 consisted of 11 mothers with infants 0­2 years old, 8 of whom had been
confederates in Study 1. An additional three mothers were recruited specifically for Study
2-2 through acquaintances. Their ages ranged from 28 to 40, and they lived in Tokyo,
Kanagawa, and Saitama prefectures.
This study was approved by the psychological research ethics committees at the
College of Contemporary Psychology at Rikkyo University. Prior consent was obtained
from the participants.
Procedure
The interview was conducted in a semi-structured form in which participants talked
freely about each question. The interview was recorded by a SD card recorder (ZOOM H2
Handy Recorder) and transcribed. Interviews for the eight mothers who participated in
Study 2-2 were conducted after Study 1.
The interview questions were as follows:
(1) How do you feel about being smiled at/talked to by a stranger when you
are out alone, with another adult, or with your infant, and why do you feel
that way?
(2) Do you recognize changes in such feelings compared to the days before
childbirth?
(3) For the mothers who participated in Study 1 and were talked to during the
experiment: How did you feel at that time, and why did you feel that
way?
Analysis
Answers to questions (1) and (3) were classified as Negative, Neutral, or Positive,
and answers to question (2) were classified as Change into Negative, Neutral, or Positive.
These classifications were performed by the first author and another independently with a
Kappa coefficient of .77; the first author's data were used.
Results
Table 3 shows the classifications of feelings about approaches from strangers,
recognized changes since childbirth, and feelings about being talked to during the
experiments as answered by the five mother confederates who were talked to in Study 1.
The numbers in parentheses on the table represent the number of answers by confederates
of Study 1. Examples of words and sentences from the interviews are shown in Appendix
2.

was the most frequent answer only in the With-Own-Infant condition, although this
condition showed fewer Positive answers compared to the Smiled-At reaction.
Regarding changes in feelings recognized since childbirth, many answers were in

mentioned wariness about harm to her infant.
Most answers concerning feelings about having been talked to during the
experiments were classified as Positive; no answer was Negative.
Discussion
The present study was conducted on the two psychological factors which would
maintain a human cooperative breeding system; we examined what kinds of people reacted
to an infant (Study 1) and how mothers felt about approaches by strangers toward
themselves and their infants (Study 2). For Study 1, from the perspective of the EEA and
based on prior studies, we predicted that women would react more than men to the mother
and infant and that minors and older adults would react more than middle-aged people. The
results of Study 1 confirmed the differences in frequency of looking at the mother and
infant among age groups as hypothesized and, therefore, predicted the universal
distribution of attention toward an infant according to age regardless of culture and time.
However, there was no indication of difference according to sex. The results for smiling
were reversed: The difference was found by sex but not by age. From Study 2, which used
a hypothetical scenario, we found that mothers are receptive to strangers' interest in their
infants. This could mean that they see interest as an indication of potential helpers in that of
in-group members.
The results of Study 1 showed that, with respect to sex difference, there was no
significant effect on looking, but there was an effect on smiling. Therefore, in this study,
the sex difference could occur in how to behave after attention is attracted; women tend to
smile more when they perceive an infant. This result is consistent with the result of facial
muscle activity after presentation of infant face photographs (Hildebrandt and Fitzgerald,
1978). For talking, three of six cases were initiated by adult men. In particular, case 5
occurred with a group composed entirely of young adult men. Although the sample size
was too small to be discussed, a man's approach toward an infant is worth considering.
In substantial contrast to caretaking behavior, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa (2005) reported
that the homicide rate in Japan has decreased drastically; in particular, a huge decrease has
been seen in the rate of homicides committed by young men. The homicide rate in Japan is
currently the lowest level in the world (UNODC, 2013). This tendency may be associated
with Japanese men showing more positive reactions to infants than men in other countries,
and may be explained by a proximate factor of testosterone, since testosterone level is
related to patterns of crime (Dabbs, Carr, Frady, and Riad, 1995; Dabbs, Riad, and Chance,
2001) and parental care (Gettler, McDade, Feranil, and Kuzawa, 2011; Gray, Kahlenberg,
Barrett, Lipson, and Ellison, 2002).
Regarding the change in values over time, gender roles in Japan seem to be unclear,
where childcare provided by men has become socially acceptable. Globalization and
Westernization have encouraged egalitarian views in childrearing, leading many Japanese
men to value family life (Shwalb and Shwalb, 2014). Although no similar study has been
conducted, notions around gender roles in Japan have certainly changed in the 30 years
since Robinson et al. (1979) and Schleidt et al. (1980) carried out their research. These
factors that are derived from culture and time influence the attitudes of men in present-day
Japan.
The hypothesis of differences among age groups was supported in looking:
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -483-
Participants under 12 and over 50 years old looked more often than other age groups.
Practically, the ages of most observed participants in the under-12 age group were
estimated to be around the age of infant confederates or a little older. Therefore, a high
frequency of looking in this age group would not be associated with caretaking behavior
but rather with friendship.
The essential point of Study 1 should be increased looking in the over-50 age group,
parallel to previous studies and, therefore, a robust indication of the tendency. Robinson et
al. (1979) interpreted the phenomenon from the perspective of kin selection: Interest in an
infant could increase in aged people associated with their grandchildren. This phenomenon
seems to be consistent with the results of Feldman and Nash's (1979b) observation that
grandparents exhibited more interest in an infant than did people who did not yet have
grandchildren, and that grandmothers reacted to an infant more often than grandfathers did.
The grandmother hypothesis (Hawkes et al., 1998) may also lie with their interpretation.
However, the explanation by kin selection for these phenomena cannot answer why older
people's attention is attracted to an unfamiliar and, thus, presumed non-kin infant.
It would be effective to consider the features of humans' life history, society, and
cooperative breeding to comprehend the results of Study 1. Humans have a long life span,
which includes a long post-reproductive stage in women (Hawkes, O'Connell, Jones,
Alvarez, and Charnov, 1998). Their society includes many unrelated members, so some
cognitive features cannot be explained by ancestral environments based on kinship (Hill et
al., 2011). Multiple individuals contribute to childcare (Kramer, 2010). When considering
the likelihood of alloparenting, people in stages other than reproductive could afford to pay
attention to infants who were not their own. Moreover, people who would usually be with
infants of their community could likely be responsive to infants; these tendencies might be
applicable to women, as we predicted. There is a question regarding the increased looking
of older adult men in the present study. Studies of traditional societies suggest that older
adult men do not necessarily contribute to alloparenting, even of their grandchildren (Hrdy,
2009; Scelza, 2009), much less to unrelated infants (Ivey, 2000). At a minimum, this
phenomenon should be further examined in both men and women.
Age groups did not have a significant effect on smiling in this study. As a limitation
of the present study, the sample size was small compared to previous studies, and the
number of participants in each age group varied widely. Smiling was analyzed in
participants whose looking was observed, so the sample size was further reduced (to only
17). These factors could influence the results. The present study is comparable to previous
studies that use the observation of passersby, where the characteristics of the sample can be
seen as largely equivalent, excluding differences in culture and time. The present study
showed different results from that of Schleidt et al. (1980) with respect to the absence of a
significant effect of smiling by age group. Although this discrepancy could be the result of
differences across culture and time, small sample size also could also be an issue.
The experiments were conducted in Tokyo and surrounding areas because of the
residential location of confederates. This is a limitation to the representativeness of results,
where results may be biased toward certain characteristics of participants and may not be
generalized to the rest of Japan. Despite this, it can be said that we observed typical people
who live in an urban area in Japan, though we were unable to observe people who live in
rural areas.
Study 2-1 indicated that the With-Own-Infant condition scored significantly higher
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -484-
on the pleasantness scale for a stranger's approach than the Alone or With-Another-Adult
conditions. Regarding the type of reaction by strangers, the Talked-To reaction scored
significantly lower on the pleasantness scale than the Smiled-At one. A similar result was
obtained from Study 2-2; the positive feeling was the mode only in the With-Own-Infant
condition both for the Smiled-At and the Talked-To reactions, although in the Talked-To
reaction, positive answers were fewer than in the Smiled-At one. These findings of Studies
2-1 and 2-2 were intended to be parallel, so we will discuss the results of the questionnaire
and interviews based on the words and sentences used in the interviews as follows (See
Appendix 2).
Originally, humans innately feared strangers, especially males, who threatened
children and adults in the evolutionary past. As a result, modern adults continue to show
negative emotions toward them, despite the evidence that strangers are no longer dangerous
(Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2010). Fessler, Holbrook, Pollack, and Hahn-Holbrook (2014)
showed contrary findings to the present study. Parents estimated a stranger to be more
formidable than non-parents, perhaps because parental injury reduces their fitness,
subsequently risking the fitness of their children. The results of the present study showed a
little support for the concern of mothers toward strangers. Some words implying caution
were used during interviews when the participants were discussing the With-Own-Infant
condition. Increased wariness was also mentioned in answers to questions about changes
since childbirth.
Although it is natural that mothers pay attention to the safety of their infants, Hrdy
(2009) described human mothers as hyper-vigilant but not hyper-possessive. Study 2
indicated many mothers perceive strangers' approaches positively. In Study 2-2, even the
participant who was the confederate in Study 1 and had been talked to by young men (case
5) answered positively. The results of Study 2 need particular explanation, as they ignore
previous findings that strangers are perceived as out-group members (Hahn-Holbrook et al.,
2010) and, usually, in-group members are perceived positively (Brewer, 1979). Many
mothers in the present study received a stranger's approach favorably when they imagined
they were accompanied by their infant. One of the explanations for this phenomenon could
be that they perceive strangers, who show positive reactions toward them and their infants,
as a sign of potential in-group members who can help them.
Although our hypothetical scenario included the situation of being talked to by a
stranger, the results of Study 1 showed talking to confederates rarely occurred in realistic
situations (similar to the study of Schleidt et al., 1980). We conducted Study 1 to replicate
previous studies, using a similar study design. This study focused on just one chance of
individuals passing through. However, there are a range of situations that can occur in real
life where contact with strangers is possible, such as being in a supermarket, an elevator, or
a waiting room of a clinic. The likelihood of talking to mothers and their infants could be
different in such cases. The hypothetical scenarios of Study 2 were made quite vague
("when you are out"), which were not the same as the situation of Study 1. In this case,
mothers could imagine situations where they would be likely to be talked to by strangers.
This ambiguity in the hypothetical scenarios, of course, also acts as a limitation of
Study 2. The type of stranger, according to sex, age and so on, could influence mothers'
acceptance of their approaches. As mentioned above, male strangers were likely to be
dangerous in an evolutionary context (Hahn-Holbrook et al., 2010). Additionally,
participants in the present study were living in Tokyo (an urban area). Therefore, for a
Human cooperative breeding
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(2). 2015. -485-
resident area of the participants there could be some biases. Different results could be
yielded in rural areas, where the meaning of a stranger would be more similar to that in the
EEA due to the face-to-face nature of the community.
In conclusion, Study 1 suggests a human universal and unique distribution of
attention toward infants with the rise in older adults. Study 2 showed that mothers received
strangers' approaches positively. The results of Study 1 reflect the environment where
humans have evolved to attend to and care for their infants. The results of Study 2,
however, suggest that mothers are receptive to strangers' approaches, which would be
unlikely to occur in the EEA. This can be explained by the tendency of modern mothers to
perceive strangers as potential helpers. This is seen as a feature of cooperative breeding,
where humans rear children with various in-group members.
