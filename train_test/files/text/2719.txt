Investigating firearm injury trends over the past decade, we examined temporal trends overall and according to
race/ethnicity and intent in fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries (FFIs and NFIs) in United States during 2001­2013.
Counts of FFIs and estimated counts of NFIs were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Poisson regression was used to analyze overall and sub-
group temporal trends and to estimate annual change per 100,000 persons (change). Total firearm injuries (n =
1,328,109) increased annually by 0.36 (Ptrend
< 0.0001). FFIs remained constant (change = 0.02; Ptrend
= 0.22) while
NFIs increased (change = 0.35; Ptrend
< 0.0001). Homicide FFIs declined (change = -0.05; Ptrend
< 0.0001) while
homicide NFIs increased (change = 0.43; Ptrend
< 0.0001). Suicide FFIs increased (change = 0.07; Ptrend
< 0.0001)
while unintentional FFIs and NFIs declined (changes = -0.01 and -0.09, respectively; Ptrend
< 0.0001 and 0.005).
Among whites, FFIs (change = 0.15; Ptrend
< 0.0001) and NFIs (change = 0.13; Ptrend
< 0.0001) increased; among
blacks, FFIs declined (change = -0.20; Ptrend
< 0.0001). Among Hispanics, FFIs declined (change = -0.28;
Ptrend
< 0.0001) while NFIs increased (change = 0.55; Ptrend
= 0.014). The endemic firearm-related injury rates during
the first decade of the 21st century mask a shift from firearm deaths towards a rapid rise in nonfatal injuries.

The majority of firearm violence victims are nonfatally in-
jured, and approximately one third of victims are fatally in-
jured (1, 2). In the United States during 2001­2013, there
were 406,496 fatal firearm injuries (FFIs) (10.2 per 100,000
persons) and an estimated 921,613 nonfatal firearm injuries
(NFIs) (23.4 per 100,000), compared with a rate of death by
any injury of 57.6 per 100,000. The majority of the nonfatally
wounded require medical attention, and 80% of those may re-
quire hospitalization (3, 4). Despite aggressive resuscitation
and treatment being available to these victims, many have
poor quality of life and heavy morbidity throughout their
remaining life. A substantial proportion of these wounded
subsequently die of health consequences directly related to
firearm-related trauma (4, 5). Despite this burden of NFI, our
understanding of NFI is much more limited than is our under-
standing of FFI (6, 7). Most of the current evidence on NFI
has focused on an evaluation of injury severity and in-
hospital outcomes that have used data from trauma centers
(5) or nationally representative hospitalizations where firearm
injuries do not include minor injuries treated in the emer-
gency department (ED) followed by discharge (3, 8, 9). Des-
pite its importance to understanding the total firearm injury
burden, to our knowledge, no study has compared FFI and
NFI. In this study, we aimed first to document and compare
the temporal trends of national FFI and NFI rates during
2001­2013 and second to assess differences in temporal

trends among subgroups according to race/ethnicity and in-
tent, separately for FFI and NFI.
METHODS
Data sources
We used FFI and NFI data from national counts and esti-
mates that were derived by querying the restricted, publicly
available injury data available through the Web-based Injury
Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). WIS-
QARS is an interactive database launched by the National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (6). Fatal injury data
for WISQARS are collected through the National Vital Sta-
tistics System operated by the National Center for Health
Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/), which uses Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes
for determining the underlying cause of death (10). The data
source for NFI reports was the National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System­All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP), a
collaborative effort between the CDC's National Center
for Injury Prevention and Control and the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission. The NEISS-AIP collects data on
nonfatal injuries of all types and external causes, using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
classification (1), from 66 of the 100 NEISS-AIP designated
hospital EDs. NEISS-AIP hospitals include large inner-city
hospitals with trauma centers and large urban, suburban, ru-
ral, and children's hospitals. The 66 NEISS-AIP hospitals
are a nationally representative, stratified probability sample
of all US hospitals that have at least 6 beds and 24-hour
emergency services (11). These 66 hospitals provide data on
approximately 500,000 ED injury cases annually, weighted
by inverse probability of selection to provide national esti-
mates (6). Although the ED cases are monitored and reported
for deaths, posthospitalization deaths are not accurately re-
corded (12). Therefore, we used location-specific FFI data
from the CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic
Research (WONDER) to identify posthospitalization firearm
deaths (2). The details are presented in Web Appendix 1, Web
Tables 1 and 2 (available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). To
protect patient privacy and prevent inadvertent identification
of cases, the National Center for Health Statistics and the
National Association of Public Health Statistics and Infor-
mation Systems restrict country- and state-level reporting
of deaths to cumulative frequencies of 10 or more (6).
Study population
Our study population was a total of 1,328,109 individuals
who sustained firearm injuries between 2001 and 2013, of
which 406,496 were FFIs and 921,613 were NFIs. Only
35,662 (2.7%) of FFI deaths occurred in a hospital, hospice
facility, or nursing home/long-term care facility, and there
may be an overlap between FFIs and NFIs. The annual popu-
lation and aggregate counts of FFIs and NFIs were obtained
separately for overall and according to age, sex, race/
ethnicity, and intent of injury. Each case in the fatal injury
report corresponds to 1 death and each case in the nonfatal
injury report corresponds to 1 ED case, which may have been
either treated and released (NFI-ED) or further hospitalized/
transferred/left against medical advice (NFI-hospitalizations).
Variables and definitions
All firearm injuries were broadly categorized as FFI or
NFI. Age groupings were 0­14 years, 15­44 years, and 45
years. Racial/ethnic information for FFI was available separ-
ately as race (white, black, or other) and ethnicity (Hispanic
or non-Hispanic). These designations were recoded for
consistency into the same 4 categories as for NFI: 1) non-
Hispanic white, 2) black (both Hispanic and non-Hispanic
black), 3) Hispanic (except Hispanic-black), and 4) other.
For FFI, intent of injury was available in 4 categories: homi-
cide (assault, including legal intervention), suicide (self-
inflicted, intentional), unintentional, and undetermined. For
NFIs, unintentional and undetermined were available only
as a single category. For comparability between NFI and
FFI intent, we collapsed the separate categories of uninten-
tional and undetermined available for FFI injuries to create
identical categorizations for intent in NFI and FFI.
Statistical analysis
First we used annual injury counts as numerator and popu-
lation as denominator to calculate crude rates per 100,000 per-
sons overall and for each subgroup of age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and intent of FFI and NFI. We used crude rates to be con-
sistent with the Poisson regression analysis performed using
actual counts. We present analyses using crude counts to ac-
curately represent the counts available for analyses in the
publicly available data. Second, we assumed linear trends
across 13 years in order to assess the temporal trends in fire-
arm injuries, and we used Poisson regression (a log-linear
model) to model annual firearm-event counts and predict the
firearm injury rates by injury type. We used Poisson regres-
sion because there were no zero counts and the mean of the
distribution of counts was equivalent to the variance. Add-
itionally, we compared the fit with negative binomial regres-
sion models and zero-inflated negative binomial models by
first plotting the predicted residuals from both models by the
count of FFI and NFI events, and second with goodness-of-
fit comparisons using the Akaike information criterion,
Bayesian information criterion, and Vuong test (13). Third,
using a Poisson regression model, we predicted the annual
rates per 100,000 and estimated incidence rate ratios, 95%
confidence intervals, and discrete annual change in injury
rates per 100,000 persons for overall and by subgroups. The
significance of the temporal trend was assessed from the
model using Ptrend
. Fourth, we performed 2-way interaction
tests to determine whether the temporal trends within each
category of the subgroup varied across the categories of the
injury type of FFI and NFI. Three-way interaction tests were
also performed between temporal trends of each subgroup
category across injury type and across all the categories of
the subgroups. We used Pinteraction
to assess the significance
of interactions and Pearson's goodness-of-fit to confirm
model fit. Fifth, we also performed a sensitivity analysis by

excluding from NFI-hospitalization those FFI deaths that
occurred in the hospital, hospice, or nursing homes.
All P values were 2-sided and significance level was
<0.05. STATA/MP, version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas; 2009), was used for data analyses.
RESULTS
During 2001­2013, a total of 1,328,109 firearm-related
injuries were recorded. Of these, 406,496 (30.6%) were
FFIs. Figure 1 displays the stacked annual rates and tem-
poral trends of FFI and NFI during 2001­2013. The overall
FFI rates ranged from 10.4 to 10.6 per 100,000 persons
without a significant increase (annual change = 0.02;
Ptrend
= 0.22) while NFI rates increased from 22.1 to 26.7
per 100,000 (annual change = 0.35; Ptrend
< 0.0001), with a
significant overall increase (annual change = 0.36;
Ptrend
< 0.0001). After exclusion of 35,662 cases from the
NFI group that may have been misclassified as nonfatal due
to a possible later death (Web Appendix 1, Web Tables 1
and 2), the results are comparable (Web Figure 1).
Table 1 presents the temporal trends during 2001­2013 of
FFI and NFI within categories of race/ethnicity. According to
race/ethnicity, the overall firearm injury trends showed an in-
crease among non-Hispanic whites (annual change = 0.28;
Ptrend
< 0.0001) and a decline among others (non-Hispanic)
(annual change = -0.46; Ptrend
= 0.006). Specifically, the in-
crease among whites was for both FFI and NFI, with no dif-
ferential in trends by injury type (Pinteraction
= 0.92). Among
blacks, Hispanics, and others (non-Hispanic), FFI showed a
declining trend while NFI increased among Hispanics (annual
change = 0.55; Ptrend
= 0.014) and declined among others
(non-Hispanic) (annual change = -0.38; Ptrend
= 0.024).
Trend for type of firearm injury was significantly different by
age(Pinteraction
= 0.037)andbyrace/ethnicity(Pinteraction
=0.001)
but not by sex (Pinteraction
= 0.49).
Figure 2 demonstrates temporal trends by intent for FFI
and NFI during 2001­2013. Homicide firearm injuries in-
creased annually by 0.38 per 100,000 (Ptrend
< 0.0001).
However, homicide FFI showed an annual decline (-0.05;
Ptrend
< 0.0001), while homicide NFI increased across 13 years
(annual change = 0.43; Ptrend
< 0.0001) (Pinteraction
< 0.0001).
Suicide firearm injuries increased annually at 0.082 per
100,000 (Ptrend
< 0.0001), with increasing trends exclu-
sively observed for suicide FFI (annual change = 0.07;
Ptrend
< 0.0001) and no difference in temporal trends by
injury type (Pinteraction
= 0.53). Unintentional and undeter-
mined injuries showed an annual decline of -0.10 (Ptrend
=
0.002), with declines for both FFI (annual change = -0.01;
Ptrend
< 0.0001) and NFI (annual change = -0.09; Ptrend
=
0.005). The difference in temporal trends by injury type was
significant for unintentional and undetermined injuries
(Pinteraction
= 0.014). The difference between temporal
trends of each subgroup category across injury type and
across all the categories of the subgroups was significant
(Pinteraction
< 0.0001).

Hispanic) (annual change = -0.25; Ptrend

was a decline in homicide FFI, no change in homicide NFI
in all racial/ethnic groups, and an increase in NFI among
whites (annual change = 0.08; Ptrend

(annual change = 0.66; Ptrend

temporal trends by type of injury was significant among
whites (Pinteraction

Hispanics (Pinteraction

trends of each injury type were significantly different across
race/ethnicity (Pinteraction

were unchanged among blacks, Hispanics, and others
(non-Hispanic) but increased among whites (annual
change = 0.16; Ptrend

among whites (annual change = 0.16; Ptrend

declined among blacks (annual change = -0.02; Ptrend

racial/ethnic groups. Suicide injury temporal trends of each
injury type were significantly different across race/ethnicity
(Pinteraction

injury rates plateaued among whites and declined among
Hispanics (annual change = -0.12; Ptrend

Unintentional/undetermined injury temporal trends of each
injury type were significantly different across race/ethnicity
(Pinteraction

trends of FFI and NFI by age and sex are presented in Web
Table 3.
DISCUSSION
Using the most comprehensive national data from
2001­2013 on FFI and NFI, we observed, as expected, that
of all firearm injuries, two thirds were nonfatal and only a
third were fatal. We present 4 novel findings. First, we
showed that an increase in overall firearm injury rate across
13 years was driven by an increase in NFI with no change
in FFI. Second, overall firearm injury trends were charac-
terized by opposing intent-specific trends of increasing
homicide and suicide injuries and declining unintentional/
undetermined firearm injuries. The increase in homicide
firearm injuries was characterized by a moderate decline in
FFI and an 11-fold greater increase (0.43 vs. -0.05 annual
change per 100,000 persons) in NFI, while the increase in
suicide injuries and decline in unintentional/undetermined
injuries was driven by FFI in their respective directions.
Third, although blacks had overall firearm injury rates
4-fold greater than whites, there was a decline in FFI
among blacks, while FFI and NFI increased among whites.
Fourth, while the decline in homicide FFI occurred across
all racial/ethnic groups, the increasing trend in suicide FFI
was characterized by a substantial increase among whites
and an opposing but moderate decline among blacks and
Hispanics.
Our demonstration of an increase in overall firearm injuries
adds to the finding of a steadily increasing trend of all vio-
lence involving firearms reported by the Department of Jus-
tice, where the rates of firearm injury among all injuries
related to violence increased from 7.3% in 2000 to 8.2% in
2011 (14). This recent increase shown in our study suggests a
reverse in the decline in firearm injury rates that occurred dur-
ing 1993­2002 (7, 14). The unchanging FFI rate after 2000
was similar and a continuation of the lack of an upward or
downward trend that we reported in our work using firearm
deaths from 2000­2010 (15). More important, to our knowl-
edge, there have been no studies that assessed the temporal
trends of NFI that included both ED and hospitalizations. To
date, the evidence regarding NFI was an incomplete represen-
tation of either ED or hospitalizations, amounting to 30% and
40% of the overall firearm injuries (1, 3). We demonstrate in
this study that a large increasing temporal trend in NFI drove
the increasing overall firearm injury rates, which in turn was
largely due to mounting homicide NFI rates, despite a minor
reduction in homicide FFI.
The rising rates of homicide and suicide and declining
rate of unintentional/undetermined firearm injury in our
study were consistent with similar findings from several
sources that used smaller samples (14, 16­18). The oppos-
ing but large increase in homicide NFI that we report was
similar to the increasing trend described in the National
Hospital Discharge Survey (3). When the intent was suicide,
self-inflicted firearm-related injuries usually resulted in
death (10, 16, 17). The increasing suicide FFI rates in our
study mirror the overall suicide rates in the United States,
which are currently at an all-time high and have increased
by more than 11% during the 1990s (19). The decline of un-
intentional/undetermined FFI and NFI among all races/eth-
nicities in our study is consistent with the steady decrease
reported over the past 2 decades (20, 21). While the findings
in our study are concordant with piecemeal evidence from
different studies, our results provide direct comparisons be-
tween the temporal trends of homicide, suicide, and uninten-
tional/undetermined overall firearm injuries, establishing
that the increase in homicide firearm injury is primarily due
to homicide NFI increase, whereas the increasing suicide
and decrease in unintentional/undetermined firearm injuries
are driven by the respective intent of nonfatal injuries.
Among all racial/ethnic groups, we found the highest rates
of firearm injuries--86.8 per 100,000 person in 2013--
among blacks, and it was 4-fold higher than that among white
population and was similar to previous studies (3, 15). How-
ever, between 2001 and 2013, this racial gap between blacks
and whites began narrowing from a ratio of 5.5 to 4.25 for to-
tal firearm injuries and from 2.0 in 1.6 for FFI. This trend is
consistent with 2 CDC reports: Gotsch et al. (1), before 2000,
addressed both FFIs and NFIs, and Athar et al. (22) included
a disparities report between 2003 and 2006. Our data suggest
that the reason behind this narrowing gap was a confluence of
consistently increasing firearm injury rates among whites dri-
ven by FFI and NFI and an overall decline in firearm injury
rates among blacks, predominantly FFI. FFI rates among

a Racial/ethnic categories were non-Hispanic white; black (including Hispanic and non-Hispanic); Hispanic (for all
races other than black), and other non-Hispanic.
b The sum of fatal and nonfatal injuries within each racial/ethnic subgroup may not always add up to the total due
to missing information in racial/ethnic subgroups for nonfatal firearm injuries.
c Pinteraction
values are from 2-way interactions, testing whether temporal trends vary between fatal and nonfatal
firearm injury within each racial/ethnic group by intent of injury.
d Pinteraction
values are 3-way interactions, testing whether the difference in fatal and nonfatal injury temporal trends
within each racial/ethnic group vary between the 4 racial/ethnic groups within each intent.
e Incidence rates and estimates for others (non-Hispanic) in the unintentional nonfatal firearm injuries may be un-
reliable due to the small number of events.

The Hidden Epidemic of Firearm Injury in the US 551
whites and blacks in our study were an extension of the ana-
lysis performed using WISQARS data from 2000­2010 that
was indicative of such an opposing trend (15). The increasing
NFI, indicative of greater severity of injury among whites in
our study, is in opposition to the lower rates among whites in
the 1990s (23), suggesting a possible reversal in trends
among whites after 2000. The increase in NFI among whites
was comparable to that seen in data from a more recent
cohort study from a health maintenance organization in
northern California that showed whites were more likely to
be hospitalized for suicide firearm injuries than were other
race groups (24).
We found an overall decline in firearm homicide that oc-
curred among all racial/ethnic groups. While our results
were consistent with earlier studies using the same data over
a shorter period (15) and similar to those of another study of
homicide trends exclusive to young adults, our results span
a longer and more recent time period and are applicable to
all age groups (18). Our results demonstrating the decline in
homicide FFI being driven mainly by blacks and Hispanics
build on a similar study that showed a decline among these
racial/ethnic groups using data from a shorter time period,
indicating the sustained decline among these racial/ethnic
groups beyond 2010 (15). The increasing trend in suicide
FFI rates in our study that was predominantly among whites,
while blacks and Hispanics showed a moderate decline, was
comparable to findings in a report by the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Health using death certificates and hospital dis-
charges, in which whites showed higher rates of firearm
suicide than did other racial/ethnic groups (25). The decline
among Hispanics was also similar to that in an analysis
using a shorter time period where the decline was moderate
(15). The decline in unintentional/undetermined FFI and
NFI in all racial/ethnic groups observed in this study was
also previously reported in 2 trend-analysis studies of fatal
and hospitalized firearm injuries, without the inclusion of
ED-treated NFI (3, 15).
Our study has to be interpreted in the light of certain limita-
tions. The absence of individual patient data and the weighted
estimates of nonfatal injuries are the most obvious limitations.
While the lack of individual data renders it impossible to val-
idate categorization of firearm injury, the rigorous nature of
the data-collection procedures using multiple data sources
may reduce the possible misclassification bias. On the other
hand, the weighted estimates of counts of nonfatal injury
data, especially the lack of follow-up after hospitalization,
may have overestimated the counts of NFI-hospitalizations,
which we have attempted to correct by excluding the deaths
known to have occurred during hospitalization, hospice, or
nursing home care. The results from the sensitivity analysis
were robust. However, in the event of such overestimation,
our results for temporal trends in NFI may be slightly exag-
gerated. We were also unable to assess the obvious state-
specific differences in injury type trends due to the lack of
state-specific aggregate data on nonfatal injuries. Not being
able to account for state-specific associations may bias the re-
sults in either direction, which is not estimable. In previous
studies, the profile of undetermined injuries did not compare
to that of any other intent of injury (3, 7). However, the non-
fatal injury data in WISQARS are reported in a cumulative
undetermined/unintentional category that forced us to com-
bine the 2 categories among fatal injuries to be comparable.
This might weaken or amplify the results depending on the
actual difference between the 2 categories, which unfortu-
nately cannot be quantified.
The epidemic of firearm violence, driven largely by non-
fatal injuries, is an important public health problem that is
characterized by an increased health-care burden, reduced
quality of life, and increasing costs. Considering that the
majority of FFI are due to suicides, the continuous and
sizeable increase in suicide FFI observed in our study indi-
cates a systemic national problem, which has several
underlying social and individual factors that have been ne-
glected for a long time and continue to be unaddressed. In
conclusion, the public health consequences and the enor-
mous costs associated with firearm injuries are of increas-
ing concern, considering the epidemic of NFI. Our data
show that this public health emergency is driven primarily
by nonfatal injuries.
