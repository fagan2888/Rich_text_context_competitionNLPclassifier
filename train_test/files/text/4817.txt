Uncertainty can be very unsettling, and research indicates
that people go to lengths to cope with it. Uncertainty threats
have been shown to increase conviction in important social
attitudes (McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, & Spencer, 2001), to
pursue personal projects that are more consistent with one's
values (McGregor et al., 2001), to increase identification
with minimal groups (Grieve & Hogg, 1999), and to increase
negative responses when fair process is denied (van den Bos,
2001). Uncertainty has even been shown to increase claimed
religiosity (Wichman, 2010) and support for religious war
among otherwise relatively liberal students (McGregor, Haji,
Nash, & Teper, 2008).
These compensatory responses to uncertainty seem to be
at odds with the intuitive meaning of uncertainty. Intuitively,
uncertainty should make people careful information proces-
sors; it could also weaken and might even negate whatever
contents of mind are active at that time. For instance, a per-
son who is uncertain and attempting to reach a decision
might continue to deliberate past the point where other peo-
ple would be satisfied. Indeed, research shows that both
chronically accessible and situationally activated uncertainty
can cause such effects (Jacobson, Weary, & Lin, 2008).
Additional research demonstrates that uncertainty can reduce
participants' use of social category information, and thus
reduce stereotyping, when they make judgments about oth-
ers (Weary, Jacobson, Edwards, & Tobin, 2001). Yet other
research shows that situationally induced uncertainty can
reduce source effects on persuasion, reducing source-
stereotype-consistent judgments (Tiedens & Linton, 2001).
These findings seemingly contradict data showing increased
intolerance for others when uncertainty is induced (van den
Bos, Euwema, Poortvliet, & Maas, 2007), or increased religi-
osity (Wichman, 2010) when uncertainty is induced.
Uncertainty, from an intuitive perspective, should reduce intol-
erance, and possibly reduce religiosity, not increase it.
Fortunately, recent research suggests an answer to this
contradiction. When uncertainty is situationally induced,
people seem to show compensatory responses to the extent
that uncertainty threatens, or signals frustration with, their
currently active goals (Nash, McGregor, & Prentice, 2011).
In much of the previous research showing increased process-
ing or reduced reliance on stereotypes when uncertainty is
active, the uncertainty may not have frustrated an active goal.
For instance, in work demonstrating how uncertainty reduces
reliance on source stereotypes for persuasion (Tiedens &
Linton, 2001), uncertainty was induced by evoking emotions.

UncertaintyThreat Can Cause
Stereotyping:The Moderating
Role of Personal Need for Structure
Aaron L.Wichman1
Abstract
Uncertainty threats can cause a wide range of compensatory responses.The present research demonstrates how uncertainty
threat can cause a particular response with significant social consequences: stereotyping. Participants in this study completed
a measure of implicit stereotyping after being exposed to an uncertainty threat or not.They also completed an individual
difference measure to tap into their needs for predictability and structure. Results showed that uncertainty threat caused
increased stereotyping of an ethnic out-group when needs for predictability and structure were high.For participants who did
not have a high level of these needs, uncertainty did not increase stereotyping.When uncertainty threatens important goals
such as prediction and control of events, individuals who most value these goals seem to be the ones who are most likely to
use stereotypes.These stereotypes, ironically, may reduce the success of accurate event prediction for the very people who
place the greatest value on predictability and structure.

This type of uncertainty did not obviously threaten partici-
pants' active goals.
In work by Weary and colleagues (2001), uncertainty
about the causes of events may have been perceived as more
threatening, but participants may have been able to access
and then apply stored uncertainty-coping action plans and
thus avoided compensatory responding. The best-studied
action plan in response to uncertainty about the causes of
events is increased processing in the service of attaining
judgment accuracy (see Weary, Tobin, & Edwards, 2010 for
a review). Therefore, previous research may not have shown
uncertainty to increase stereotyping due to factors such as
the uncertainty not being threatening to active goals (e.g.,
Tiedens & Linton, 2001), or habitual increased processing
triggered in conjunction with uncertainty about the causes of
events. If uncertainty was seen as a threat to active goals, or
if uncertainty was activated in a context that did not make
increased processing action plans accessible (or applicable;
cf. Higgins & Brendl, 1995), uncertainty might no longer be
associated with reduced stereotyping. In fact, uncertainty
might trigger compensatory responses such as those dis-
cussed above when it is seen as a signal of a frustrated goal.
Responses to goal frustration always are a joint function
of the person and situation, which can both either amplify or
attenuate responses. The individual difference of personal
need for structure (PNS; Neuberg & Newsom, 1993) is one
example of a person factor that interacts with situations in
affecting judgments and behavior. PNS is a measure of pref-
erence for clear structure, order, and certainty in the world.
These preferences seem to be more strongly expressed when
people are exposed to signals that their goals might be frus-
trated. For instance, Terror Management Theory researchers
have demonstrated that when high PNS individuals are
reminded of their mortality (presumably a signal that their
goals ultimately will be frustrated), compared with low PNS
individuals, high PNS individuals show increased percep-
tions of meaning in their lives (Vess, Routledge, Landau, &
Arndt, 2009), increased preference for interpersonal balance
and just-world thinking, but decreased liking for behaviorally
inconsistent targets (Landau et al., 2004). Of special interest,
a PNS-related variable, Need for Closure (NFC; Kruglanski,
Webster, & Klem, 1993), has been shown to interact with
reminders of death such that higher NFC, compared with low
NFC, is associated with greater (less) liking for stereotype-
consistent (inconsistent) targets. Importantly, NFC affected
liking this way only under conditions where participants had
been reminded of their mortality (Schimel et al., 1999). All
of these findings are consistent with need for structure as a
person factor that moderates responses to signals that goals
may be frustrated.
One way to think about uncertainty is that it can threaten
our goals to predict, organize, and control events. Because
PNS predicts preference for predictability and order, it is logi-
cal to assume that people high, compared with low, in PNS
would react more strongly to experiences that threatened
their sense of predictability, certainty, or control. Uncertainty
threat is one such experience. The current study investigated
whether uncertainty about the causes of events would cause
increased threat responding among higher PNS individuals.
Responses to psychological threat have been examined in
many forms. Preference for arguments that do or do not
uphold one's worldview (Lavine, Lodge, & Freitas, 2005),
liking for charismatic political candidates (Gillath & Hart,
2010), attitudes toward essay writers who criticize one's in-
group or not (Arndt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &
Simon, 1997), conviction in important social attitudes
(McGregor et al., 2001), reactions to fairness violations (van
den Bos, 2001), identification with potentially extremist
groups (Hogg, Sherman, Dierselhuis, Maitner, & Moffitt,
2007), and others, all have been examined.
The current research examined how uncertainty threat, in
conjunction with PNS, might affect stereotyping. The PNS
both allowed for the identification of individuals who should
be more threatened by this uncertainty, and suggested how
these individuals might react to this psychological threat. As
a general hypothesis, people high in PNS under uncertainty
were expected to respond by attempting to impose order on
their environment, in this case, by stereotyping. People high
in PNS should experience the uncertainty threat as more rel-
evant to their desires for order and structure, and might
respond by affirming the very desires for order and structure
threatened by the uncertainty. More specifically, people
higher, as opposed to lower, in PNS were expected to show
increased stereotyping under uncertainty, using a measure of
implicit stereotyping described below.
Method
Participants completed packets as part of a voluntary class
project. Participation was anonymous, and participants were
randomly assigned to condition. After first indicating their
ethnicity and gender, participants completed a measure of
their desire for predictability and order. They then went on
to complete either an uncertainty or control induction, fol-
lowed by a filler task, and ultimately the measure of implicit
stereotyping, which they subsequently scored themselves. A
debriefing followed.
Materials
PNS scale. The PNS scale (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993)
served as an index of participants'desire for control, predict-
ability, and order (e.g., Moskowitz, 1993). The PNS has 12
items, such as "It upsets me to go into a situation without
knowing what I can expect from it." And "I don't like situa-
tions that are uncertain." Items were answered on a 1 =
strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree scale. People scoring
higher on this scale prefer to organize information in simple
ways and are more likely to stereotype than those low on this
scale (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993).

Uncertainty manipulation. Uncertainty condition partici-
pants responded to the following two questions, based on
previous work by van den Bos (2001) and Wichman, Brun-
ner, and Weary (2008): "Please briefly describe the thoughts
that you have when you are uncertain about why something
has happened" and "Please jot down, as specifically as you
can, what you think physically and emotionally happens to
you when you feel uncertain about why something has hap-
pened." These questions were designed to activate uncer-
tainty about why things happen, and to threaten needs for
structure and control as measured by the PNS. Control con-
dition participants answered parallel questions about watch-
ing TV.
Filler task. All participants completed the PANAS-X
affect measure (Watson & Clark, 1994) as a filler task. Pre-
vious research has shown that uncertainty effects often
occur only once a delay period has passed (e.g., Wichman et al.,
2008). The PANAS-X provided for this delay.
Dependent measure. Participants completed the stereotypic
explanatory bias (SEB; Sekaquaptewa, Espinoza, Thompson,
Vargas, & von Hippel, 2003) measure to index implicit stereo-
typing. The SEB presents participants withAfrican- and Euro-
peanAmericanstereotype-consistentorstereotype-inconsistent
sentence stems. Participants then complete the stem as they
wish to make a complete sentence. For instance, an African
Americanstereotype-consistentsentencewouldbe"DeShawn
purchased some baggy pants," whereas a stereotype-
inconsistent stem would be "Jamal was the only student who
answered the problem." Stereotypically African American
and European American names were counterbalanced across
sentence stem type so that in one counterbalance condition, a
stem might beAfricanAmerican stereotype consistent, but in
the other counterbalance condition, a stereotypic European
American name was used to make the sentence appear incon-
sistent with European American stereotypes. A number of
neutral filler items were included to reduce suspicion as to
the nature of the task (see Appendix A for the sentence stems
used in this task).
To the extent that participants endorse stereotypes as a
way to make sense of the world, stereotype-inconsistent
behaviors described in sentence stems should elicit expla-
nations. According to Sekaquaptewa et al. (2003), the
explanatory bias occurs when participants are more likely
to explain stereotype-inconsistent behaviors than they are
to explain stereotype-consistent behaviors (see also Hastie,
1984). Therefore, a response to the above sentence about
DeShawn's pants reading, "and went out with his friends"
(no explanation of a stereotype-consistent behavior), and
completing the sentence about Jamal with "because he had
taken advantage of tutoring help" (explanation of a stereo-
type-inconsistent behavior) would be interpreted as stereo-
typing. The SEB measure is scored by counting the number
of explanatory versus nonexplanatory sentence completions
for stereotype-consistent and -inconsistent behaviors, then
subtracting the number of stereotype-consistent behaviors
explained from the number of stereotype-inconsistent
behaviors explained (see Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003;
Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza, 2004, for greater detail on
scoring the SEB). To the extent that participants explain
stereotype-inconsistent behaviors, but do not explain stereo-
type-consistent behaviors, this is interpreted as stereotyping
(Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003). Previous research shows that
participants showing stronger SEB ask more stereotypic
questions when interacting with an out-group member
(Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003). The SEB is thus a measure of
the extent to which people use stereotypes to interpret
their world. Explanations in the SEB are an indicator of
the perceived inadequacy of the preferred, stereotype-
driven, processing style, and thus are thought to reflect
stereotype usage. As might be expected for a stereotyping
measure, research shows that the SEB predicts discrimi-
nation when participants are interacting with an out-group
member (Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003).
After completing the sentences, participants were asked
to indicate for each sentence completion whether it in some
way explained why the behavior described in the sentence
stem occurred (see Appendix B for these instructions).
Participants' ratings then were used to compute SEB scores,
as described below.
Results
A total of 75 participants (61 female) completed the experi-
mental materials anonymously and voluntarily. Of the 75
participants, 53 were European American, 14 were African
American, 5 were Hispanic American, and 2 were Asian
American. Previous research shows that the SEB is more
sensitive to stereotyping when targets are low-status group
members, as opposed to high-status group members
(Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza, 2004). To capitalize on this sen-
sitivity and to avoid difficulties with the smaller samples of
non-European Americans, analyses focused on the responses
of the higher (in the United States) group status European
Americans.
To begin, PNS items were rescored and averaged so that
higher scores indicated greater need for structure (Cronbach's
 = .87). The PANAS-X (Watson & Clark, 1994) filler task
was examined next. Uncertainty induction condition had no
effect on general negative or general positive affect (respec-
tive Cronbach's s = .78 and .67), t
PosPANAS
(1, 52) = 1.34, p =
.19; t
NegPANAS
(1, 52) = 1.57, p = .12.
The SEB was scored by using participants' ratings of
whether their sentence completions were explanations of the
behavior described in the sentence stem. As in previous
research (e.g., Sekaquaptewa et al., 2003), two SEB scores
were computed for each person. SEB scores for African
American and European American targets were separately
created by subtracting for each ethnic group the number of
explanations for stereotype-consistent behaviors from the
number of explanations for stereotype-inconsistent behaviors.
4 SAGE Open
Higher values on the SEB score therefore meant higher lev-
els of implicit stereotyping (SEB
BlackTarget
M = 0.15, range =
-4 to +4; SEB
WhiteTarget
M = ­0.22, range = -4 to +2). These
two SEB scores then were checked to see if they differed
across counterbalancing condition. As expected, counter-
balancing of stereotypically African- and European
American names had no effect on SEB scores, t
BlackSEB
(1,
52) = -1.20, p = .24; t
WhiteSEB
(1, 52) = ­0.95, p = .35.
Counterbalance condition was not further considered as a
factor.
To investigate the main hypothesis, PNS scores first were
standardized, and uncertainty condition was dummy coded
(uncertainty was the comparison condition, coded 0). SEB
scores then separately were regressed onto these variables
and their interaction. For African American targets, this anal-
ysis showed a PNS by uncertainty interaction,  = -1.09, t
(1,49) = -3.16, p = .003,  2
partial
= .17. This interaction was
plotted at ±1 SD on the PNS distribution (cf. Aiken & West,
1991) and is depicted in Figure 1. Simple slopes tests (Aiken
& West, 1991) showed that whereas PNS was nonsignifi-
cantly negatively associated with SEB scores for Black tar-
gets in the control condition,  = ­0.45, t (1,49) = -1.69, p =
.10, 2
partial
= .17, it positively and significantly predicted
SEB for Black targets in the uncertainty condition,  =
0.639, t (1,49) = 2.92, p = .005, 2
partial
= .15. Furthermore,
whereas uncertainty condition had no significant effects for
participants low in PNS,  = 0.507, t (1,49) = 1.05, p = .30,
2
partial
= .02, as PNS scores increased to +1 SD, the uncer-
tainty induction as compared with the control group showed
greater implicit stereotyping,  = -1.68, t (1,49) = -3.48, p =
.001, 2
partial
= .20.
This finding that uncertainty increased explanations rela-
tively more for stereotype-inconsistent than stereotype-con-
sistent sentences shows that uncertainty in this case does not
simply increase people's tendency to explain events. Instead,
uncertainty in this case specifically increased explanations
when behaviors were stereotype inconsistent, indicating that
uncertainty increased the use of stereotype-consistent expec-
tancies for behavior.
SEB scores for European American targets also were
coded as described above and regressed onto uncertainty
condition, PNS, and their interaction. Unlike SEB scores for
African American targets, there were no significant effects
for European American SEB scores (all ps > .20). Whereas
uncertainty threat interacted with PNS to predict increased
stereotyping of African American targets, it did not do so for
European American targets. This finding is consistent with
previous research (e.g., Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza, 2004),
but also has some possible implications, which are described
below.
Discussion
These findings provide evidence that uncertainty threats can
increase stereotyping. They add to the many effects that
previously have been linked to uncertainty threats, and
demonstrate how PNS can amplify responses to such
threats. When exposed to uncertainty, high PNS individuals
explained more counterstereotypic behaviors for stereo-
typic African American names. This effect was not found for
stereotypically European American names.
Although some previous research has found that PNS
is positively associated with stereotyping in general
(Neuberg & Newsom, 1993), PNS scores in the control
condition for African American targets were nonsignifi-
cantly negatively associated with stereotyping. This trend
was unexpected, but other researchers have discovered a
similar trend. Conceptually, consistent with the relation-
ship between PNS and stereotyping under uncertainty
threat as reported here, Schimel et al. (1999; Study 5)
found that NFC (Kruglanski, Webster, & Klem, 1993)
positively predicted liking (dislike) for stereotype-
consistent (-inconsistent) targets under psychological
threat conditions induced using mortality salience.
However, also conceptually consistent with the (nonsig-
nificant) relationship between PNS and stereotyping in
the control condition reported here, they found that NFC
(nonsignificantly) negatively predicted liking (dislike) for
stereotype-consistent (-inconsistent) targets. The meaning
of these trends in the control conditions of these studies is
unclear, but these trends in no way detract from the essen-
tial finding: It appears that uncertainty threats sometimes
can cause stereotyping.
One might expect that uncertainty threat, as a threat to
prediction and control needs, would increase attempts to
explain all types of events and behaviors, rather than only
stereotypically inconsistent behaviors performed by out-
group members. The fact that stereotyping under uncertainty

threat was confined to out-group members suggests some
social motivation for this effect.
This finding can be interpreted in a number of ways. One
interpretation is that prediction and control needs are espe-
cially important when thinking about out-groups, whose
behaviors demand explanation so that intergroup relations
can function smoothly. This is consistent with evidence
showing that we are more likely to remember stereotype-
consistent out-group behaviors than we are to remember
stereotype-consistent in-group behaviors (Koomen &
Dijker, 1997). In this case, stereotype consistency appears
to be more important for out-groups than in-groups. Phrased
differently, possibly threatening out-groups who behave in
stereotype-consistent ways are predictable; stereotype-
inconsistent behavior demands explanation if we wish to
maintain predictive control.
Another interpretation is that those participants most
strongly under psychological threat (those with higher PNS
scores) felt the need to adhere to (for them) socially domi-
nant worldviews. These worldviews codify the stigmatiza-
tion of some out-groups by embedding them in a matrix of
stereotypically prescribed behaviors. Stereotype-inconsistent
behaviors, then, break free of the matrix and threaten the
worldviews that participants normally would rely on to main-
tain predictive control. This interpretation of the role of
uncertainty threat is broadly consistent with Kay and Friesen's
(2011) work on how the status quo of social systems tends to
be upheld more strongly under conditions of low personal
control. The uncertainty threat used here was designed to
challenge prediction and control beliefs, and may have caused
increased out-group stereotyping for this reason.
Although these explanations are plausible, work with
the SEB has shown that the stereotype explanatory bias is
most likely to occur for low-status targets. That is, when
targets are described as low status (opposed to high sta-
tus), SEB scores are higher (Sekaquaptewa & Espinoza,
2004). Uncertainty threat is therefore clearly only one of a
number of factors contributing to stereotyping on this
measure in this case. Future research might investigate
whether uncertainty threats cause differential stereotyping
on other measures, such as the implicit association task
(Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Another ave-
nue for future research could be whether uncertainty
threat can even increase stereotype-consistent behavior
predictions based on photographs of targets from different
groups. In considering what these different groups might
be, it could be useful to investigate the generalizability of
this effect to other social categories--to religion, gender,
and perhaps age.
Along with the other studies demonstrating compensatory
responses to uncertainty threat in areas as varied as fairness
research (van den Bos, 2001) and in-group bias work (Hogg
et al., 2007), these results add to our understanding of the
many forms compensatory responses to uncertainty threat
can take. They also increase our knowledge of how individ-
ual difference factors can operate in conjunction with envi-
ronmental factors to amplify and channel our responses.
People vary in their needs for structure, predictability, and
control. In situations where uncertainty is frequent, such as
scientific research, investing, or intergroup conflict, high
needs for structure may cause overreliance on established
ways of thinking. To the extent to which uncertainty stems
from established ways of thinking to begin with, this overreli-
ance may trigger a vicious cycle of ever-more rigid thinking.
There is a need to better understand how cycles like this
can be controlled. Some existing work (e.g., Wichman,
2010) provides insight into this, but more work is needed.
The present research suggests that low needs for structure
may protect against uncertainty that targets our perceptions
of being able to predict and structure our worlds. Prediction
and control are important motives, but if we care about them
too much, we lose our ability to respond flexibly when we
are threatened.

Instructions for Self-Rating of SEB Sentence Completions
Please go back to the sentences you completed earlier. You
could have completed these sentences in any way you
chose.
Go back to the sentences and place an "E" next to each
sentence that has a completion that explains what the main
character did.
For instance,
Brandon easily made the basketball team "_because he
practiced a lot_" is an explanation of why he made the basket-
ball team. There are other ways to describe why actions hap-
pen,forinstance,bysayingBrandoneasilymadethebasketball
team "_due to his work ethic_." This is also an explanation.
Please go back and put an "E" in capital letters next to each
sentence that you think you completed in a way that explains
the actions of the subject in the first portion of the sentence
that was already printed when you filled out this packet. We
are interested in what you think your explanations are. Do not
worry too much about being "correct." If you think your sen-
tence ending explains why the first portion of the sentence
happened, please put an "E" next to that sentence. Thanks.
