Obesity is a key public health issue for US youth. Previous research with primarily white samples of youth has indicated that
sexual minority females have higher body mass index (BMI) and sexual minority males have lower BMI than their same-gender
heterosexual counterparts, with sexual orientation differences in males increasing across adolescence. This research explored
whether gender and sexual orientation differences in BMI exist in nonwhite racial/ethnic groups. Using data from Waves I­IV
(1995­2009) of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 13,306, ages 11­34 years), we examined associations
between sexual orientation and BMI (kg/m2) over time, using longitudinal linear regression models, stratified by gender and
race/ethnicity. Data were analyzed in 2013. Among males, heterosexual individuals showed greater one-year BMI gains than
gay males across all race/ethnicity groups. Among females, white and Latina bisexual individuals had higher BMI than same-
race/ethnicity heterosexual individuals regardless of age; there were no sexual orientation differences in black/African Americans.
Sexual orientation disparities in BMI are a public health concern across race/ethnicity groups. Interventions addressing unhealthy
weight gain in youth must be relevant for all sexual orientations and race/ethnicities.
1. Introduction
Obesity is a key public health issue for US youth, particularly
among specific sociodemographic groups, including some
racial/ethnic and sexual orientation groups [1, 2]. Obesity is
operationalized as having a body mass index (BMI) equal
to or greater than the 95th percentile among individuals
younger than age 18 years or a BMI of 30 or greater for
individuals age 18 years or older [3]. Previous research in
a primarily white cohort of youth and young adults, age
12­23 years, found that sexual minority (nonheterosexually
identified) females had higher BMI than heterosexual females
throughout adolescence [4], similar to patterns seen in adult
females [5]. Among males in this cohort, gay males had
higher BMI in early adolescence compared to heterosexual
males, but by late adolescence BMI among gay males was
lower than their heterosexual peers [4], similar to patterns
seen in adult males [6]. However, little is known about the
intersection of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation and its
impact on youth weight status.
A small number of studies have investigated sexual
orientation patterns in BMI among multiethnic samples of
adults [7, 8]. One such study found that among females, white
and African American sexual minorities were at increased
risk of being overweight compared to same-race/ethnicity
heterosexual individuals, whereas among adult males, gay
males were less likely than heterosexuals to be overweight
among white, African American, Asian, and Latino men [7].
We are aware of only one study with a representative sample of
adolescents examining sexual orientation disparities in BMI
in a multiethnic sample, which found that bisexual female
and male youth were at elevated risk for obesity compared to

same-gender heterosexual youth across race/ethnicity groups
[9]. However, no research has explored whether an age-by-
orientation interaction effect exists in racial/ethnic minority
youth.
Disparities in BMI among sexual minorities have been
explained primarily using the minority stress model, which
suggests that experiences of prejudice and discrimination
based on minority status negatively affect health [10]. Sexual
minorities who are also racial/ethnic minorities may be at
greater risk for negative health outcomes due to experiences
of minority stress based on being a member of multiple
minority groups [11, 12]. Individuals may cope with minority
stress by engaging in unhealthy weight-related behaviors.
Indeed, research on sexual orientation, body image, and
eating disorders in primarily white samples of adults has
suggested that compared with heterosexuals, gay males
indicated greater body dissatisfaction and eating disorder
symptomatology [13, 14].
An alternative explanation is that sexual orientation
disparities in BMI are related to sociocultural ideals regarding
body appearance. For instance, sexual minority male youth
reported greater desire for muscularity, but fewer attempts
to gain weight, compared to heterosexual male youth [15].
Among adult females, lesbian and bisexual individuals indi-
cated lower internalization of sociocultural appearance ideals
for a thin body type compared to heterosexual females
[14]. These findings may help to explain why sexual minor-
ity females have higher BMI and sexual minority males
have lower BMI, compared to their same-gender hetero-
sexual counterparts. However, similar to research on sexual
orientation-by-gender disparities in obesity, this research
was conducted with primarily white samples. More research
is needed to first identify whether sexual orientation-by-
gender disparities in obesity exist in nonwhite racial/ethnic
groups and then to examine whether explanations for these
disparities apply across racial/ethnic groups.
Previous obesity prevention and intervention efforts have
been only marginally successful, in part because they tend not
to be appropriately tailored and instead use a one size fits all
approach. In a recent review of school-based Internet obesity
prevention programs for adolescents, a number of programs
targeted racial/ethnic minorities who are at greater risk for
obesity and the majority of programs included content on
nutrition and physical activity [16]. However, none of the
programs reviewed seemed to address issues related to sexual
orientation and obesity, such as body image or sociocultural
ideals of thinness and muscularity. More research is needed
to identify subgroups most at risk for obesity by determin-
ing whether sexual orientation-by-gender disparities exist
across race/ethnicity groups, such that intervention and
prevention efforts can be more effectively tailored for these
groups.
The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is a
critical period for weight gain and the development of obesity,
with long-term negative health implications for excessive
weight gain during young adulthood [17, 18]. In addition,
previous research has indicated that associations between
sexual orientation and BMI change across adolescence and
into young adulthood [4]. Longitudinal research with nation-
ally representative samples of adolescents is needed to address
whether age-by-sexual orientation effects exist among non-
white youth. To address this question and to inform obesity
prevention and weight-loss intervention efforts, the current
study used longitudinal data from Waves I­IV of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to
examine sexual orientation disparities in BMI over time
within female and male race/ethnicity groups. Specific sexual
minority subgroups were compared separately to heterosex-
ual individuals because previous research has found BMI
and obesity prevalence to differ among these subgroups, with
bisexual individuals at particularly high risk for elevated
BMI and obesity [9, 19]. We hypothesized that female sexual
minorities, particularly bisexual individuals, would have
consistently higher BMI over time than heterosexual females.
We further hypothesized that heterosexual males would
experience greater one-year increases in BMI compared to
gay males. Finally, we hypothesized that these patterns would
be similar across all three racial/ethnic groups.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Sample. After exclusion criteria were applied
(described below), the current sample included 7,140 females
and 6,166 males, who contributed data to at least one of
the four waves of Add Health, a US nationally represen-
tative longitudinal cohort [20]. Participants were age 11­21
years at Wave I (1995) and age 24­34 years at Wave IV
(2008-2009). Analyses were restricted to participants who
provided a report of sexual orientation identity at Wave III
and self-identified as non-Latino white (59%), non-Latino
black/African American (23%), and Latino (18%) at Wave I.
Other race/ethnicity groups were excluded due to a small
sample size within some sexual orientation groups. Descrip-
tive statistics for age and BMI by race/ethnicity, gender,
and sexual orientation are reported in Table 1. This study
was approved by the Boston Children's Hospital Institutional
Review Board.
2.2. Measures. Sexual orientation identity was assessed at
Wave III with one item asking participants to choose the
description that best fits how they think about them-
selves, with the following response options: 100% hetero-
sexual (straight); mostly heterosexual (straight), but some-
what attracted to people of your own sex; bisexual, that is,
attracted to men and women equally; mostly homosexual (gay),
but somewhat attracted to people of the opposite sex; 100%
homosexual (gay); not sexually attracted to either males or
females. Gender was assessed at Wave I as female or male.
Race and ethnicity were assessed separately at Wave I but
recoded and combined into the following groups for anal-
ysis: non-Latino white, non-Latino black/African American,
and Latina/o. Age in years and age-specific BMI (kg/m2)
calculated from self-reported height and weight were assessed
at each wave. Self-reported height and weight were used
because measured height and weight were not available at all
four waves.

2.3. Statistical Analysis. To test the hypotheses, we conducted
longitudinal unweighted linear generalized estimating equa-
tion analyses in SAS (version 9.3; Cary, NC). Data were
analyzed in 2013. Analyses were stratified by gender and
race/ethnicity, with heterosexual as the reference group. For
the current study, participants who responded that they were
not sexually attracted to either gender were excluded from the
analyses, and mostly homosexual and 100% homosexual were
combined into lesbian/gay due to small sample sizes, yielding
the following sexual orientation identity groups: heterosexual,
mostly heterosexual, bisexual, and lesbian/gay. To address
the nonlinearity of BMI across development [21­23], age
was modeled both linearly and quadratically and sexual
orientation-by-age was used to model repeated measures of
continuous BMI across ages 11­34 years, with age and BMI
updated at each wave.
Weights are typically used in analysis of data from Add
Health to allow for population estimates. We conducted
unweighted analyses because the complexity of the models in
examining BMI trajectories across waves and accounting for
clustering by schools did not allow for the incorporation of
weights. In addition, a model-based analysis is reasonable if
design effects are taken into account [24], which the current
analysis did by adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, and age.
3. Results
Sexual orientation and race/ethnicity group differences in
mean age at each wave were found. Among females, bisex-
uals and mostly heterosexual individuals were significantly
younger (bisexual range: 0.33 to 0.43 years; mostly heterosex-
ual range: 0.25 to 0.30 years) than completely heterosexual
individuals at all waves,  < 0.02 to  < 0.0001. No
significant sexual orientation group differences were found
among males for mean age at each wave. Among both females
and males, Latinos were significantly older (female range:
0.43 to 0.49 years; male range: 0.36 to 0.44 years) than
same-gender non-Latinos at all waves,  < 0.0001. In
addition, non-Latina black/African American females were
significantly older (0.15 years) than non-Latina white females
at Wave II only,  < 0.01.
Descriptively, among both females and males across sex-
ual orientation and race/ethnicity groups, age-specific BMI
increased substantially across time from age 11 to 34 years
(Table 1, Figure 1). Among females, the association between
sexual orientation and BMI did not differ significantly by
age, so sexual orientation-by-age interaction terms were not
included in the final models. Non-Latina white and Latina
bisexual individuals had higher BMI compared to their het-
erosexual female counterparts, while no sexual orientation
differences were observed among non-Latina black/African
American females (see Table 2, Figure 1).
Among males, the association between sexual orientation
and BMI differed significantly by age within each of the three
race/ethnicity groups. Gay males had higher BMI than het-
erosexual males in early adolescence. However, heterosexual
males showed greater one-year BMI gains over time surpass-
ing gay males by approximately age 17 years, with disparities
widening further as participants aged into adulthood (see
Table 2, Figure 1). Bisexual individuals showed a different
pattern, with bisexual males showing greater one-year BMI
gains over time compared to heterosexual males, but only
among non-Latino white participants.
4. Discussion
Previous research with a predominantly white cohort of
youth found that age modified sexual orientation disparities
in BMI in males. The current research extended these findings
to non-Latino black/African American and Latino young
men. During adolescence and young adulthood, heterosexual
males demonstrated greater yearly increases in BMI com-
pared to gay males, putting them at excess risk for obesity. It is
not clear why these patterns are emerging, but reporting bias
could be one factor. A prior Add Health analysis found that
gay males underreport their BMI by an estimated 0.37 BMI
units more than heterosexual males [25]; nevertheless, bias of
this magnitude would not be sufficiently large to explain the
differences observed in the current study. Another potential
explanation for smaller increases in BMI among gay males
may be that compared to heterosexual males, gay males are
at greater risk for body dissatisfaction and eating disorder
symptomatology, which may result in lower BMI over time
[13, 14]. Other research has suggested that sexual minority
male adolescents and young adults are less likely to attempt
to gain weight compared to completely heterosexual male
youth [15], which may represent a protective factor against the
development of obesity among sexual minority male youth.
This study also found higher BMI among bisexual
non-Latina white and Latina females compared to same-
race/ethnicity heterosexual females, but not in other sex-
ual minority female subgroups. It is possible that bisexual
females may be responding to sexual minority stressors
(e.g., increased rates of victimization) [26] by engaging in
obesogenic behaviors (e.g., stress-induced binge eating) [27],
more so than other sexual minority females or gay males.
Higher BMI among bisexual females may also be attributable
to comorbidity of obesogenic behaviors with other health
risk behaviors and negative health outcomes. For instance,
other research has indicated that bisexual females are at
greater risk for psychological distress [28] and health risk
behaviors, including substance use [29] and self-injurious
behavior [30], compared to other sexual orientation groups.
A recent study found that compared to lesbians, bisexual
women are more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies,
which may explain more adverse mental and physical health
outcomes in bisexual females compared to lesbian females
[28]. Results from the current study highlight the need for
research on health outcomes within sexual minority sub-
groups, in addition to comparing sexual minorities with com-
pletely heterosexual individuals. In addition, more research
is needed to understand why bisexual females and males
and heterosexual males have greater risk for increased BMI
and whether membership in other sexual orientation groups
may confer specific protective factors against weight gain and
development of obesity.

5. Conclusions
Findings from this study demonstrated that sexual orienta-
tion and gender differences in BMI are not limited to non-
Latino white youth and young adults. Among males, hetero-
sexual males showed greater one-year BMI gains than gay
males across all race/ethnicity groups. Among females, non-
Latina white and Latina bisexual individuals had higher BMI
than same-race/ethnicity heterosexual individuals regardless
of age; there were no sexual orientation differences in non-
Latina black/African Americans. It is clear from these results
that sexual orientation disparities in BMI are a public health
concern across race/ethnicity groups. Obesity prevention and
intervention efforts should target healthy body image and
weight-management methods for all youth, but additional
resources may be needed for sexual minority youth. In par-
ticular, interventions should be designed in such a way as to
not exacerbate risk of unhealthy weight control behaviors and
eating disorders. In summary, obesity prevention initiatives
and treatment interventions addressing unhealthy weight
gain in adolescence and young adulthood must be relevant
for all sexual orientations and race/ethnicities.
