Epidemiology
Approximately 68% of adults in the United States are currently
overweight or obese (1). Body weight is regulated by an intricate
system of central and peripheral factors that determine energy
intake and energy expenditure. One factor that plays a role in
body-weight regulation is histamine, a neurotransmitter released
by the posterior hypothalamus. Intravascular administration of
histamine reduces food intake in animal studies (2), whereas
histamine antagonism stimulates food intake (3). Histamine
receptors are divided into four different subclasses, with the

histamine-1 (H1) and H3 receptors expressed abundantly in
the brain and implicated in appetite regulation (4). Histamine is
also a crucial mediator of inflammation in allergic disease (5).
H1 receptor antihistamines such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, and
desloratadine are among the most commonly prescribed med-
ications for the treatment of allergies and have been shown to
stimulate appetite and weight gain as side effects of treatment (6).
This analysis explores the relationship between prescription H1
antihistamine use, obesity, and underlying risk factors in adults
using data from the 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods and Procedures
Study population
The NHANES is a program of studies designed to evaluate the health
and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The
data from NHANES are used to assess the prevalence of major 
diseases
and risk factors for diseases. A complete description of NHANES
guidelines can be found online at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes (7).
All subjects provided written informed consent, and the protocol was
approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board.
The NHANES uses a stratified, probability sampling design with over-
sampling of individuals thought to be at increased health risk. Weights are
provided with the public use data set so that estimates can be made to pro-
vide a nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
population of the United States. Eligible persons 16 years are interviewed
directly, and all persons that complete the interview are invited to partici-
pate in the Medical Examination component of NHANES.
Prescription H1 antihistamine use
Two hundred and sixty-eight adults (174 females and 94 males) reported
use of an H1 antihistamine and completed all outcome measure compo-
nents. Five hundred and ninety-nine age- and gender-matched controls
(401 females and 198 males) were used as a comparison for body meas-
urements, plasma glucose, insulin concentrations, and lipid levels (7).
Body measurements
Allparticipantswhoattendedthemedicalexaminationhadtheirweights
and heights measured according to a standard protocol. BMI was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Waist
circumference was measured around the trunk in a horizontal plane
just above the uppermost lateral border of the right ilium (7).
Plasma glucose, insulin, and lipids
Fasting plasma glucose concentration was determined by a hexokinase
method, and plasma insulin concentration was measured using an
immunoassay. Fasting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein- and

Association of Prescription H1 Antihistamine
Use With Obesity: Results From the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Joseph C. Ratliff1, Jessica A. Barber1, Laura B. Palmese1, Erin L. Reutenauer1 and Cenk Tek1
The incidence of obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions. Previous research has shown several
medications exert noticeable effects on body-weight regulation. Histamine-1 (H1) receptor blockers commonly used
to alleviate allergy symptoms are known to report weight gain as a possible side effect. Therefore, we investigated the
association between prescription H1 antihistamine use and obesity in adults using data from the 2005­2006 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Adults taking prescription H1 antihistamines were matched by age
and gender with controls and compared on the basis of body measurements, plasma glucose, insulin concentrations,
and lipid levels. Prescription H1 antihistamine users had a significantly higher weight, waist circumference, and insulin
concentration than matched controls. The odds ratio (OR) for being overweight was increased in prescription H1
antihistamine users. H1 antihistamine use may contribute to the increased prevalence of obesity and the metabolic
syndrome in adults given these medications are also commonly used as over-the-counter remedies.

B levels accounted for lipid measurements. A detailed description of the
laboratory method is listed on the 2005­2006 NHANES Web site (7).
Statistical analysis
The association between prescription H1 antihistamine use with BMI,
glucose concentration, insulin concentration, and lipid levels was deter-
mined using linear regression. Samples were weighted according to
NHANES guidelines (7). Logistic regression was used to determine the
odds ratio (OR) for prescription H1 antihistamine users in relation to
overweight status (BMI >25), as well as insulin and glucose concentra-
tion, and lipid levels. All analyses were performed using SPSS, version
17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Results
Table 1 shows the comparison of means between prescription
H1 antihistamine users (n = 268; mean age = 46.9) and adult
controls (n = 599; mean age 45.6) on outcome measures associ-
ated with weight. The racial composition of the prescription H1
antihistamine users was as follows: 80% non-Hispanic white,
8% non-Hispanic black, 8% Hispanic, and 4% others. The racial
composition of the control group was as follows: 72% non-
Hispanic white, 10% non-Hispanic black, 13% Hispanic, and
5% others. The most prevalent H1 antihistamines used were
cetirizine (50%) and fexofenadine (37%). After adjusting for
gender, prescription H1 antihistamine users had 
significantly
higher weight (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.001), waist circumfer-
ence (P < 0.001), and insulin levels (P < 0.005) compared to
healthy controls. There were no differences in fasting glucose
levels, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein- or high-

density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipopro-
tein B levels between groups (data not shown). There were no
significant differences based on gender or ethnicity for any of
the outcome variables.
For both males and females using prescription H1 anti-
histamines, the odds of being overweight were significantly
increased (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.23­2.31 and 1.21; 95% CI,
0.98­1.49), respectively. After adjusting for age and gen-
der, odds of being overweight were significantly increased
for prescription H1 antihistamine users (OR, 1.55; 95% CI,
1.04­2.31). However, the OR for a greater waist circumfer-
ence was not significantly increased (OR, 0.98; 95% CI,
0.984­1.011). Prescription H1 antihistamine use did not
significantly increase the OR for elevated glucose, insulin,
or lipid levels, and there were no 
different effects among the
antihistamines.
Discussion
We found a relationship between prescription H1 antihista-
mine use and an increased risk of obesity in US adults over
the age of 18. Compared to age- and gender-matched controls,
prescription H1 antihistamine users had significantly greater
weight, BMI, waist circumference, and insulin levels.
Atypical antipsychotics with potent H1 antagonistic prop-
erties are strongly correlated with weight gain. New genera-
tion antipsychotics with high antihistaminic properties such
as olanzapine induce weight gain (8). However, the current
analysis excluded atypical antipsychotics and focused on
H1 
antihistamines prescribed for allergy relief. A previous
study (9) found an association between obesity and allergy
symptoms using the NHANES 2005­2006 data set in children
and adolescents, but did not explore this relationship in adults
or the impact of prescription H1 antihistamine use. One pos-
sible reason for the increased weight observed with prescrip-
tion H1 antihistamines may be due to an increased sedation
accompanied by their use. Although the second-generation
H1 anti
histamines prescribed in this analysis are considered
nonsedating, this may be mitigated by other factors. Cetirizine,
the most commonly prescribed H1 antihistamine in the sam-
ple, is an active metabolite of hydroxyzine, an older sedating
antihistamine, so it still possesses minor sedative qualities (10).
Second, these medications are deemed nonsedating at their
prescribed dosage; however, the dosage and usage for these H1
antihistamines were not available for the NHANES 2005­2006
data set. It is possible that prescription H1 antihistamine use
provided some sedation that resulted in decreased energy
expenditure and weight gain.
Prescription H1 antihistamine use was also associated with
a higher waist circumference and insulin concentration com-
pared to age- and gender-matched controls. Central obesity
is highly associated with increased insulin levels and insulin
resistance (11). Additionally, elevated waist circumference is
one of the criteria for metabolic syndrome, a cluster of dis-
orders that increase the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. The mechanism through which histamine modu-
lates insulin function and energy expenditure has not been
fully elucidated (12). Histamine promoted glucose uptake in
rat, but not human adipocytes (13). In humans, insulin has
been shown to upregulate H1 receptor expression (14). H1
receptor expression is also modulated by leptin levels (15),
which become elevated when insulin levels are increased. The
2005­2006 NHANES did not measure leptin levels. Perhaps

Epidemiology
the weight observed with prescription H1 antihistamine use is
related to the disruption of H1 receptor expression and bind-
ing leading to impaired insulin and leptin signaling. More
research is necessary to determine the extent of histamine's
role in energy metabolism.
The OR for being overweight in prescription H1 antihista-
mine users was 1.55. ORs, as calculated in this study, tend to
be an overestimation of the actual relative risk, but provide a
worthwhile approximation. Although two-thirds of Americans
are overweight or obese, it is crucial to further examine factors
associated with weight gain.
Analysis of this nature provides some limitations. First, the
analysis was conducted on twice as many women as men.
According to the limited sample, the association between pre-
scription H1 antihistamine use and obesity seems stronger in
men compared to women, so more research should be con-
ducted to investigate this difference. Second, the 2005­2006
NHANES data set only reports prescription medication use.
Several H1 antihistamines are available without a prescription,
so the actual number of individuals in the sample taking an H1
antihistamine is unknown. An estimated 50 million people in
the United States suffer from allergies, with ~35­50% of them
using over-the-counter antihistamines; thus, this analysis may
be underestimating the impact of antihistamines. Because
H1 antihistamines are increasingly accessible, they may be

contributing to weight gain and increased development of
metabolic syndrome. Although causation cannot be attributed
to prescription H1 antihistamine use only based on this cross-
sectional analysis, it is imperative to explore the relationship
between increased antihistamine use, obesity, and underlying
risk factors.
