Abstract
Social justice issues remain some of the most pressing problems in the United States. One
aspect of social justice involves the differential treatment of demographic groups in the crim-
inal justice system. While data consistently show that Blacks and Hispanics are often
treated differently than Whites, one understudied aspect of these disparities is how police
officers' assessments of suspects' size affects their decisions. Using over 3 million cases
from the New York Police Department (NYPD) Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) Database,
2006­2013, this study is the first to explore suspects' race, perceived size, and police treat-
ment. Results indicate that tall and heavy black and Hispanic men are at the greatest risk
for frisk or search. Tall and heavy suspects are at increased risk for experiencing police
force, with black and Hispanic men being more likely to experience force than white men
across size categories.
Introduction
According to the New York City medical examiner, on July 17th, 2014, Eric Garner, an
unarmed black man, died of a heart attack caused by Staten Island police pinning him to the
ground and applying a chokehold [1]. This case, along with the fatal shooting of unarmed
black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson MO on August 9th, 2014, has drawn public aware-
ness to issues surrounding racial profiling and excessive use of police force. There have been
several other recent cases in which unarmed black men have been killed by the police [2,3]
including: Dante Parker, who died after being stunned by a Taser gun multiple times by police
in Victorville, CA on August 12th, 2014; Walter Scott, who video footage [4] shows was shot
multiple times while running from an officer in North Charleston, SC on April 4th, 2015; and

Freddie Gray, who suffered a fatal spine injury after being apprehended by Baltimore police on
April 12th, 2015; there are also many historic cases (e.g., Abner Louima, Amadou Diallo, Pat-
rick Dorismond [5]). A recent report [6] shows that black males are 21 times more likely than
their white counterparts to be shot and killed at the hands of police at a rate of 31.17 deaths per
million as compared to 1.47 deaths per million for white males. While the data clearly demon-
strate racial disparities, an understudied aspect surrounding race and the use of force is how
officers' perceptions of suspects' size may affect police treatment. Aside from being black, Gar-
ner (6'3, 350 lbs.), Brown (6'4, 292 lbs.), and Parker (5'10, 274 lbs.), were physically large men
at the time of their deaths [1,7,8], and this may, along with their race, have affected the percep-
tions and actions of police officers. Human visual perception is not an objective or unbiased
process [9]; an officer's perception of the size of a suspect--and thus of the potential physical
danger posed by that suspect--may be influenced by the suspect's race, independent of actual
size. Size, like beauty, may be in the eyes of the beholder.
In fact, when describing his encounter with Michael Brown to the grand jury, Officer Dar-
ren Wilson testified that he "felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan. that's just how
big [Brown] felt and how small [Wilson] felt."[10] Wilson also testified that "[Brown] had the
most aggressive face. That's the only way [Wilson] can describe it, it looks like a demon, that's
how angry [Brown] looked." Wilson explained that he fired 12 shots at Brown because "at this
point it looked like [Brown] was almost bulking up to run through the shots, like it was making
him mad that [Wilson was] shooting at [Brown] [11]." Not only does Wilson's description of
the events indicate that Brown's size influenced Wilson's actions, his claims that Brown became
stronger after being hit by bullets, referring to Brown as "it," and comparing Brown to an
aggressive demon also speaks to racial issues.
Negative images of black men in American society have evolved from slavery to modern
times and continue to influence perceptions of racial difference. Past stereotypical themes such
as the "black brute" and "noble savage" are evident in contemporary media depictions of black
males as dangerous (e.g., notions of black men as thugs and gangsters) and superhuman (e.g.,
notions of what Spike Lee has termed "the mystical, magical negro" and the black athlete) [10­
13]. Waytz, Hoffman, and Twawalter's recent study [14] shows that a significant number of
white persons still perceive black persons on both implicit and explicit levels to possess super-
human capabilities as well as deny blacks persons' pain. This research along with Wilson's tes-
timony highlights the importance of analyzing the intersection of suspects' race and size when
studying police behavior.
Another recent high profile case suggesting a connection between race, perceived size, and
police treatment involved the New York Police Department (NYPD) and 6'7, 220 lbs., black
National Basketball Association (NBA) player, Thabo Sefolosha, who suffered a broken fibula
in NYPD custody on April 9th, 2015 while his teammate and fellow-arrestee, 6'11, 260 lbs.,
Pero Antic, who is white, was unharmed [15]. The NYPD provides a rich ground for investiga-
tion into racial disparities in policing because of their Stop, Question, and Frisk program. The
NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk program is legally rooted in Terry v. Ohio (1968) [16], which
permits law enforcement officers to conduct limited warrantless searches if they have a level of
suspicion of probable cause. Under Terry, if officers witness unusual conduct which leads them
to believe that a person has a weapon and is presently dangerous, officers may conduct a search
and frisk the individual to determine if they are carrying a weapon. Although The Fourth
Amendment [17] protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures and requires
search warrants to be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause, in 2009, the Wis-
consin Court of Appeals upheld that a suspect's furtive-type movement (suspicious, shifty, or
stealthy behavior), and other circumstances suggestive of a threat to a police officer's safety,
can be the basis for a protective search [18].

In Brownsville, Brooklyn, one of the precincts with the greatest percentage of stops by the
NYPD as measured against its population (29.1% in 2011), furtive movement was listed by
officers as the reason for half of the stops conducted between January 2006 and March 2010
[19,20]. Furtive movement is often discussed by scholars as a catch-all category for police to
stop whomever they please, and frequently results in a disproportionate amount of racial
minorities who are stopped. A 2012 report from The New York Civil Liberties Union [20]
shows that in 70 of the 76 New York precincts, black and Hispanic persons were the suspects
in over half of NYPD stops, even in areas where black and Hispanic individuals represented
14% or less of the population. In almost half (33) of the precincts, black and Hispanic persons
accounted for more than 90% of stops and were more likely to be frisked than Whites who
were stopped. The report also showed that in a one year period there were more stops of
young black males relative to their population in the city, suggesting that young black men
were stopped multiple times. Furthermore, 90% of the young black and Hispanic men who
were stopped by NYPD officers were deemed to be innocent [21]. In Brownsville, the arrest
rate between 2006 and 2010 was less than 1% compared to the 6% arrest rate in the rest of the
city, and in more than 50,000 stops in Brownsville during this time period, only 25 guns were
recovered [19,20]. Because of the empirical evidence documenting racial disparities in NYPD
practices, Manhattan Federal Court Judge Shira Scheindlin stated in Floyd v. City of NY
(2013) [22] that the NYPD had targeted racially defined groups, thus violating both the
fourth and fourteenth constitutional amendments. However, Scheindlin's ruling did not pro-
hibit the use of Stop and Frisk tactics; rather, it required officers to more clearly prove the
reason for their stops. It was not until March 2015 that NYPD officers were prohibited from
conducting stops solely on the basis of suspects' furtive movement or presence in a high
crime area [23].
Although many studies [24­31] document the relationship between race and differential
treatment by the NYPD, only one [29] examined the association between size, measured by
body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), and criminal punishment by the NYPD. Masicampo et al. [29]
found that rates of criminal punishment are related to suspects' body size, suggesting the possi-
bility that given the stigma of obesity, obese individuals are penalized more harshly for some
types of crime. However, the authors did not report how race affected results, and by combin-
ing height and weight into a single index (BMI) lost the ability to estimate the separate associa-
tions of height and weight with criminal punishment. Cullinane et al. [32] examined the
relationship between intimate partner violence, offender and victim body masses, and arrest
decisions and found a significant correlation between offender and victim body masses and
arrest decisions. However the researchers could not identify the cause of the correlation, and
similarly to Masicampo et al., the study did not examine racial effects nor did it include a vari-
able for height.
In the current study, we test the relationship between physical police intervention and
both perceived size and BMI, as well as explore how suspects' race may be associated with
these relationships. Apart from Masicampo et al. and Cullinane et al., no previous research
has analyzed suspects' perceived body size and police practices, though past theories of biol-
ogy and crime, such as Sheldon's somatotyping of criminal behavior [33] as well as several
recent studies assess the relationship between individuals' body type, height, and weight and
likelihood of committing crime and being arrested [34­36]. Here we used data from the
NYPD Stop, Question, and Frisk (SQF) Database, 2006­2013 to test whether perceived
height and weight are related to physical police intervention, including whether suspects
were frisked or searched, whether force was used against suspects, and whether race affects
the relationship.

Methods
Data
NYPD SQF data are publically available and do not contain identifying information; therefore,
this study was approved by The University of Alabama at Birmingham's IRB under the Appli-
cation for Designation of Not Human Subjects Research. The most recent years available for
the NYPD SQF database are 2006­2013. Although data are available from 2003­2005, those
years were excluded due to noted concerns with the usability of the coding of `suspected crime,'
a key covariate in our model.
The SQF database is comprised of officer-recorded reports of their interactions with individ-
uals "when the officer has reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in criminal activity."
This level of interaction is referred to as a "stop, question, and frisk" interaction and is consid-
ered to be between "common-law right of inquiry" and arrest in terms of severity, although a
SQF interaction may escalate into an arrest [30]. Each entry contains information regarding the
suspect, the reasons for the stop, the circumstances of the stop, and the officer's response. The
database contains data from 4,111,828 stops; of those we analyzed the 3,195,304 stops of males
18 years and older, of which 10% were white, 53% were black, and 32% were Hispanic. Due to
the small numbers of suspects denoted as Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan
native, and other (178,113 cases, 5% of sample) the three groups were merged and analyzed in a
single `other' category. Additional descriptive statistics for this sample are given in Table 1.

Variable Definitions
We emphasize that when we refer to height, weight, or size, we refer to the officer-perceived
values unless otherwise noted. We considered these perceived values to be reasonable for analy-
sis as it is the officer's perception of suspect size rather than clinically measured values that
could affect their decision to physically intervene. The perceived size of the suspect was defined
categorically based on the combination of recorded height (under 66", 66­72", 73"; under
5'6", 5'6"-6', 6'1") and weight (under 141 lbs., 141­205 lbs., 205 lbs.). These bounds were
chosen because they were the 10th and 90th percentiles in this sample and approximate reason-
able bounds for what constitutes a tall, short, light, or heavy adult American male.
We also analyzed the NYPD SQF database using the suspects' BMI category instead of
height and weight categories. Suspect BMIs were calculated via the officer reported height and
weights and categorized as underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25 kg/m2),
overweight (25 to 30 kg/m2), or obese (over 30 kg/m2). No values were missing but a small por-
tion (0.64%) had values for height, weight, or BMI that were deemed biologically implausible
based on what was observed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 2005­2012 [37]. Suspects with implausible anthropometric values had their
BMI replaced using multiple imputation [38].
Statistical Analysis
Generalized linear mixed models were used to make inferences about the combinations of race
and size, modeled as a race-by-height-by-weight interaction, with regard to the marginal odds
of the suspect being frisked or searched and to the odds of having force used against them. The
estimated adjusted odds ratios were calculated with medium-sized (66­72", 141­205 lbs.)
white suspects as the reference group while controlling for thirty-two covariates relating to the
time and place of the stop, the reasons for the stop (including the suspected crime), and suspect
characteristics besides race and size [30]. The precinct in which the stop took place was treated
as a random effect to account for correlation present between stops due to similarities in the
neighborhoods or the officers making the stops. The covariates used in the analysis are listed in
Table A in S1 File, and their effects are given in Tables B, C, D, and E in S1 File. The alpha level
to determine statistical significance and confidence interval (CI) width was set at 0.01 (2-tailed;
99% CIs) to account for the large sample size.
The analysis of the different definition of size using BMI categories was identical to the one
described above. Full methodological details are available in the supplement (S1 File).
Results
Suspects' Perceived Height, Weight, Race, and Police Physical
Intervention
Results indicated that for most height and weight categories, black and Hispanic suspects were
at increased risk of being frisked or searched compared to their white counterparts, even when
controlling for the circumstances of the stop (Fig 1). The counts and proportions of stops with
physical intervention for each height/weight/race category are given in Table 2.
Among medium-sized (66­72", 141­205 lbs.) suspects, black suspects had 24.0% increased
odds of being frisked/searched (99% CI: 22.1% to 26.0%) and Hispanic suspects had 21.2%
increased odds (99% CI: 19.3% to 23.2%) compared to medium-sized white suspects. The
height-weight category was also observed to have a significant association with the odds of
being frisked/searched (p<0.0001) such that large suspects had higher odds of being frisked/
searched. White suspects perceived as very large (73", over 205 lbs.) had 9.5% higher odds of

being frisked/searched compared to medium-sized white suspects (99% CI: 3.2% to 16.1%).
This increase was even more pronounced in very large black (37.3%, 99% CI: 33.6% to 41.2%)
and Hispanic (30.9%, 99% CI: 24.5% to 37.6%) suspects when compared to medium-sized white
suspects. Predicted probabilities of being frisked or searched are given in Figure A in S1 File.
The finding of non-white and large suspects experiencing more physical intervention by the
NYPD was also seen when we examined whether the officer reported force being used on the
suspect (Fig 2). Among medium-sized (66­72", 141­205 lbs.) suspects, black suspects had
9.5% increased odds (99% CI: 7.5% to 11.5%) and Hispanic suspects had 9.8% increased odds
(99% CI: 7.8% to 11.9%) of having force used on them compared to medium-sized white
suspects.
White suspects perceived as very large (73" and over, over 205 lbs.) had 7.4% higher odds of
having force used on them compared to medium-sized white suspects (99% CI: 0.3% to 15.0%).
Very large black (20.6%, 99% CI: 17.1 to 24.2%) and Hispanic (19.0%, 99% CI: 13.2% to 25.1%)
suspects had the greatest odds of having force used upon them compared to medium-sized
whites. Predicted probabilities of having force used are given in Figure B in S1 File.

Suspects' BMI, Race, and Physical Police Response
The observed number of stops with physical intervention within each race-by-BMI category
group is listed in Table 3, and the predicted probabilities are given in Figure C in S1 File.
When modeling the odds of being frisked/searched versus race and BMI category (Fig 3,
top), we estimated that normal weight black (24.9%, 99% CI: 22.6% to 27.3%) and Hispanic
(20.1%, 99% CI: 17.8% to 22.4%) suspects had increased odds compared to normal weight
white suspects.
Looking within race categories, we did not find evidence that obese white (-2.2%, 99% CI:
-5.8% to +1.5%) or Hispanic (-1.4%, 99% CI: -3.5% to 0.6%) suspects had qualitatively different
odds of being frisked/searched compared to their normal weight counterparts. We did observe
a small decrease in the odds of being frisked or searched for obese black suspects (-3.6%, 99%
CI: -5.3% to -1.9%) compared to normal weight black suspects.
When examining the odds of force being used (Fig 3, bottom) we see that obese black
(11.7%, 99% CI: 8.8% to 14.7%) and Hispanic (10.0%, 99% CI: 7.0% to 13.1%) suspects have
the greatest odds compared to normal weight whites, slightly higher than normal weight black
(9.0%, 99% CI: 6.7% to 11.3%) and Hispanic (8.5%, 99% CI: 6.1% to 10.9%) suspects. When
looking within-race categories the odds of force being used significantly increased from normal

Discussion
Similarly to police forces across the country, the mission of the New York City Police Depart-
ment (NYPD) is to ". . . enforce the laws, preserve the peace, reduce fear, and provide a safe
environment" where police pledge to ". . . impartially enforce the law. . . value human life,
respect the dignity of each individual and render (their) services with courtesy and civility."
[39] However, while police do much good, in some instances, the very people who are
employed to serve and protect citizens sometimes perpetuate violence upon those same citi-
zens. Recent events have drawn public awareness to issues of police violence, and specifically,
the relationship between citizens' race and officers' behavior. Our results add to the discussion
by showing that not only are there racial disparities in police physical intervention, there is also
an association between suspects' officer-perceived size and police physical intervention as well
as an association between suspects' race, their officer-perceived size, and police treatment.

Although suspects perceived to be tall or heavy have increased risk of physical police punish-
ment, suspects perceived as tall and heavy are at still greater risk and tall, heavy, black and His-
panic men are at the greatest risk of all.
Further analyses show that there is a slight association between suspects' obesity status and
officers' decisions to physically intervene, especially for obese black suspects. In fact, Garner,
Brown, and Parker, were all classifiable as obese (BMIs were 30 or more) [1,7,8] at the time of
their deaths. However, the associations are not monolithic and do not lend themselves to obvi-
ous interpretation. More work is needed to explore whether obesity status as a function of race
affects officers' decisions. Obesity may be an important component in studying police treat-
ment of suspects not only because obesity had risen nationwide, but because obesity is more
common in certain racial groups [40], and is a highly stigmatized condition [41­43]. Past
research shows that rates of weight discrimination are high [44] and that obesity elicits stigma
and negative character assessments of obese people as non-compliant, evil, disgusting, unintel-
ligent, and mean-spirited [44­51] which may affect police behavior.
Aside from police treatment, recent studies [52,53] on size and the criminal justice system
have focused on sex but not race. The current study is the first to test the interaction among
race, perceived size, and criminal punishment. Although it has been shown that even when
men and women are of equal actual height, men are perceived to be taller than women [54], we
know of no comparable findings on the effects of race on perceived body size and conducting
such studies would seem merited.
Our results suggest that researchers should incorporate measures of suspects' size (or per-
haps more aptly, perceived size) when studying police behavior and police may benefit from
information about stereotypes associated with size and race. To explore and address long-
standing issues of racial stereotyping and bias, future research should examine how officers
perceive the sizes of differently-raced suspects as well as their feelings towards differently-raced
suspects across size categories. One weakness of our study is that the data are merely observa-
tional, which inhibits our ability to assert that the association between race/size and stop out-
comes is causal. Experiments should be conducted to determine if there is an association
between suspects' race and police officers' likelihood of overestimating or underestimating sus-
pects' size. Another weakness of our study is that it only examines male suspects. Future studies
should examine the relationship between race, perceived size, and physical police intervention
with regard to female suspects in order to understand the nuances associated with intersection-
ality in terms of race, perceived size, sex, and police treatment. Additionally because our study
only utilized NYPD data, our findings cannot necessarily be generalized to the broader popula-
tion, and research examining suspects' race, perceived size, and differential treatment by police
would benefit from nationally representative data.
To reduce the influence of both covert and overt prejudice in police treatment of suspects,
we recommend that officer training programs incorporate education on different types of racial
bias which extend beyond old-fashioned, biological, Jim Crow racism to include instruction on
cultural and more nuanced forms of racism such as systemic racism [55], symbolic racism [56],
laisse-faire racism [57], and colorblind racism [58]. We also encourage policy makers and
scholars to continue to examine how legislation associated with racial profiling may result in
disparities and how the personal characteristics of police officers and suspects are related to
inequalities in the criminal justice system.
