Abstract The link between adept parental monitoring (PM)
and later positive behavioral and health outcomes already has
motivated intervention trials, but questions remain about
which specific facets and mechanisms of PM make a differ-
ence. Our current research questions concern fundamental
male-female differences in PM facets as manifest in a US
cohort, re-sampled each year at age 12 through 17 years
during an interval from 2004 to 2009. We hypothesized emer-
gence, by mid-adolescence, of a specific male-female differ-
ence in a "limit time with friends" (LTF) facet of adept PM,
with overall PM levels held constant. The data, arranged using
a "mutoscope" approach, are from six successive nationally
representative independent cross-sectional sample surveys of
the cohort, with each adolescent measured only once, via a
multi-item PM module nested within the larger survey. Esti-
mates and tests of male-female differences are from a "multi-
ple indicators, multiple causes" latent structure model appro-
priate for complex survey data. In evidence consistent with the
advance hypothesis and with PM level held constant via the
model, the LTF facet generally was more relaxed for boys as
compared to girls, in a difference that emerged by mid-ado-
lescence, possibly due to greater LTF constraints for girls at
mid-adolescence. This research adds to the knowledge base
about male-female similarities and differences in facets of PM.
As a specific PM facet, LTF might function as a mechanism
suitable for deliberate intervention and as a possible specific
target in "micro-trials" of new prevention research. We
acknowledge limitations such as omitted variables, including
social media effects, not measured in this investigation's national
surveys, but of potential importance in future research on peer
influence as might have more distal parenting determinants.

Introduction
Most prevention researchers already are quite aware of the
importance of adept monitoring of children and adolescents
by their parents, with parental monitoring (PM) defined to
encompass supervision of peer relations and placing limits on
time with friends. Adept PM has been linked to a variety of
positive behavioral and health outcomes (e.g., see Dishion and
Tipsord 2011). Specific potential benefits of adept monitoring
include lower levels of affiliation with rule-breaking peers
(e.g., see Dishion et al. 1991; Lloyd and Anthony 2003), as
well as lower incidence rates and risks of becoming a newly
incident user of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD;
Chilcoat et al. 1995; Chilcoat and Anthony 1996; Cohen et al.
1994), less frequent ATOD use (Steinberg et al. 1994), and a
lower likelihood of progression to heavier drinking or other
drug use (Reifman et al. 1998; Reboussin and Anthony 2001).
This well-substantiated knowledge base about adept mon-
itoring and its positive outcomes already has become a foun-
dation for randomized clinical intervention and prevention
trials intended to strengthen families through parental educa-
tion. The resulting evidence from these trials, to date, often is
positive and supportive. Some prevention trials indicate that
intervention fidelity and implementation science issues are
crucial. For example, after informed consent processes are
used to recruit families, the volunteering parent participants

can be encouraged but not required to attend the intervention
sessions. In this manner, assessment of intervention effects
can be fragile when parents fail to attend the sessions as
planned. Nonetheless, even with unfaithful attendance, posi-
tive outcomes have been found (e.g., see Dishion and An-
drews 1995; Ialongo et al. 1999; Storr et al. 2002; Dishion and
Tipsord 2011; Spoth et al. 2011). Outcomes to date also note
the importance of research on variability of monitoring
behaviors and their effectiveness. More evidence is need-
ed to make intervention and prevention efforts more adap-
tive and customizable to individualized or subgroup-
specific needs of families.
Adolescent Age and Sex Differences in Parental Monitoring
Adolescent age and sex differences are seen for PM overall,
and in estimates of PM influence on health behaviors. In
several studies, older adolescents typically are supervised less
closely and have more experiences outside the family struc-
ture (Patterson and Stouthamer-Loeber 1984; Larson et al.
1996), concurrent with increased adolescent autonomy and
bids for independence (Steinberg 1990), as well as affiliation
with norm-violating peers (e.g., see Lloyd and Anthony
2003). Monitoring older adolescents can also be more chal-
lenging. This fact might help to increase salience of adolescent
disclosure regarding "where they are going, what they will be
doing, and whom they will be with" (Kerr et al. 2010, p. 39).
Evidence for variable PM trajectories is clear. In some
studies, there is a steady decrease in monitoring over time
for both boys and girls (Li et al. 2000; Spano et al. 2011).
Other studies show relative stability in PM levels during
middle-late childhood and early adolescent years (e.g., see
Patterson and Stouthamer-Loeber 1984; Larson et al. 1996;
Reboussin and Anthony 2001; Lloyd and Anthony 2003).
Even so, Dishion et al. (2004) draw attention to a possibility
that precocious child or adolescent independence or autonomy
might be a marker of excess risk of negative behavioral
outcomes and can disrupt otherwise adept monitoring.
Perhaps with PM levels or facets as causal determinants,
male-female differences also can be seen in various domains
of adolescent externalizing behavior, conduct problems, and
other hazard-laden experiences, with greater occurrence
among males for some of these behaviors and experiences
(e.g., marijuana smoking, getting into physical fights, and not
wearing a seat belt in a car driven by someone else), and with
greater occurrence among females for other behaviors and
experiences (e.g., forced to have sexual intercourse, and riding
with a driver who had been drinking alcohol; Eaton et al.
2006). Nonetheless, in terms of parental monitoring generally,
previous findings indicate that PM levels for girls generally
are higher than PM levels for boys in childhood and during
adolescence (e.g., see Bumpus et al. 2001; Reboussin and
Anthony 2001; Webb et al. 2002; Svenson 2003; Lloyd and
Anthony 2003). Variations in monitoring of boys versus girls
might be related to a male-female double standard in terms of
societal influences, attitudes, and expectations related to court-
ship and family formation (Axinn et al. 2011). The Axinn
research team offers empirical evidence of a parental "tenden-
cy to hold significantly more permissive attitudes toward a
future son's courtship experiences than a future daughter's
courtship experiences" (p. 429).
Investigating Specific Facets of Parental Monitoring
PM has multiple facets, some of which might be anticipated to
exert differential effects on adolescent behaviors, with poten-
tial implications for prevention science, along the lines of
mechanism-informing substudies and micro-trials advocated
by Howe et al. (2010). These discrete facets include specific
parent behaviors (e.g., limiting behaviors and soliciting infor-
mation, and encouraging adolescent disclosure), each of
which might serve as indicators of monitoring, or that might
have effects with PM levels held constant. In a recent calibra-
tion investigation intended to stimulate new prevention re-
search, we investigated the possibility that drug prevention
effects of specific parenting practices, in the specific form of
setting limits on time with friends, might be large enough to
have clinical or public health significance. We chose the "limit
time with friends" (LTF) facet of PM because it represents an
important indicator of parental behavior designed to monitor
and possibly influence peer relationships and prevent "hang-
ing out with the wrong crowd"--that is, LTF might be used to
control or regulate otherwise unregulated and generally ubiq-
uitous peer influences. Implications for prevention of health-
related behaviors such as extra-medical use of internationally
regulated drugs become clear when the issue of limiting time
with friends surfaces. One especially robust predictor of ado-
lescent drug involvement is whether adolescents have friends
who are also drug users, and the LTF facet of parenting might
have a direct influence on affiliation with drug-using or oth-
erwise deviant peers (e.g., see Dishion et al. 2004). In theory,
the LTF facet of parenting can be quite malleable and amena-
ble to change via brief interventions with parents--perhaps
more readily changed than other PM facets, particularly if an
intervention session is followed by "boosters" as might be
provided via automated SMS text messaging to a parent's
mobile phone, a topic to which we will return in this paper's
Discussion section.
That is, as an attempt to substantiate the potential impact
and importance of research on the LTF facet of parenting, our
calibration investigation sought to learn whether LTF-
associated differences in estimated incidence of adolescent
drug use might approach the size of observed male-female
incidence differences--with knowledge that these male-
female differences are considered to be of clinical and public
health significance, sufficient to foster a National Institute on
Prev Sci
Drug Abuse initiative on sex and gender differences in drug
taking. In our already published work on LTF, we found that
the estimated LTF effect on incidence of drug might be
as large as or larger than recently observed male-female
differences in risk of becoming a drug user (Seedall and
Anthony 2013).
Purpose of This Study
Building upon these recent findings, we set out to probe the
LTF facet of PM in an effort to build a stronger empirical
foundation for potential future use in a targeted micro-trial or
other trials of interventions designed to enhance PM. With
respect to LTF, we expected no male-female difference in the
level of the LTF facet of parenting in early adolescence, but
we thought that the LTF disparity would arise during the
middle years of adolescence, with LTF levels for females
becoming larger than those for males in later adolescence,
when courtship and unwanted pregnancies become more sa-
lient as parenting concerns in relation to daughters relative to
sons (Axinn et al. 2011).
In addition, the PM knowledge base requires renewal from
time to time due to possible secular or cohort changes in
parenting practices. As a result, we designed this study to
provide an initial exploration, via a novel "mutoscope" ap-
proach as described below, of twenty-first century patterns of
the overall PM construct while also working toward our
primary aim of seeking information regarding potential age
and male-female differences in the intensity of the LTF facet
of monitoring and supervision.
This report describes some a priori expectations with
respect to our specific interest in the LTF facet of parenting,
with overall PM levels as a background issue. As already
mentioned, we thought that there might be no LTF differences
in male-female contrasts as childhood ends and adolescence
begins (i.e., at age 12 years), with overall PM levels held
constant. Thinking developmentally, we expected to see emer-
gence of a specific male-female LTF difference once issues of
worry about precocious sexual activity and pregnancy became
more salient during the adolescent years, especially by age
17 years, still with overall PM levels held constant. Concep-
tual models depicting the main steps in our analysis plan are
displayed in Fig. 1a­c.
An important methodological limitation of this exploratory
study, to which we will return in later sections of the paper,
involves measurement equivalence and assumptions that have
to be made about the metric of the overall PM latent variable.
Under the models fit here, for our primary hypothesis about
the LTF facet of the PM construct, we use the standard
regression approach to hold constant overall PM levels while
estimating this male-female difference in LTF values as ob-
served. Because we have 12 subgroups under study (boys and
girls in each of six age-year substrata), we have not tried to
establish PM measurement equivalence as might allow us to
draw more definitive conclusions about how the PM levels
vary across these subgroups, which would require much larger
samples of each age-sex subgroup than are now available. We
can offer preliminary estimates for male-female and age dif-
ferences based on an untested assumption about PM measure-
ment equivalence, but our primary focus is on estimation of
male-female variation in the LTF facet, which does not require
measurement equivalence for the overall PM construct. Sta-
tistically informed readers may appreciate the context in rela-
tion to the concept of statistical power to detect differences.
Once we subdivide these samples into age-sex strata, the
number of individual participants in each subgroup stratum
becomes so small that there is a quite constrained statistical
power to detect a departure from measurement equivalence.
Instead, we estimate the possibility of an LTF difference
emerging as this nationally representative sample of a birth
cohort of males and females ages from 12 to 17 years, with
PM level held constant, and we leave the issue of male-female
differences in PM level as a topic for future and more defin-
itive research to confirm PM measurement equivalence across
the age-sex strata under study.
Materials and Methods
Study Population, Sampling, and Assessment Procedures
The 2004­2009 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH) represent examples of sustained epidemiological
surveillance, with non-overlapping samples drawn each year
from national probability sampling frames designed to include
non-institutionalized US citizens, age 12 years and older. The
NSDUH research team takes special care to ensure nationally
representativeness of the samples via multi-stage area proba-
bility sampling and recruitment protocols. NSDUH partici-
pants complete a multi-module audio-enhanced computer-
assisted self-interview (ACASI) for gathering of information
on hundreds of variables relating to a variety of health-related
issues, including alcohol and drug use, mental health, and
general health concerns. From 2004 to 2009, the NSDUH
total sample consisted of 333,732 respondents, with just under
one third of respondents being between the ages of 12 and
17 years (n=108,560).
Our specific sample was generated from a longitudinal
trace consisting of 18,551 respondents, as distributed in the
year-age strata shown in Table 1. That is, a nationally repre-
sentative US sample of 12-year-olds was drawn, recruited, and
assessed with the ACASI modules in 2004. A new non-
overlapping sample of that same original cohort was drawn,
recruited, and assessed in exactly the same manner, each year
from 2005 to 2009, such that the cohort of 12-year-olds in

2004 had become 13 years old in 2005, 14 years old in 2006,
and so on. The intent is for no individual to be assessed more
than once (i.e., sampling without replacement). Arising from
successive nationally representative sample surveys, the large
numbers of boys and girls at each age enhance statistically
precise and generalizable study estimates.
To conceptualize this research approach, consider an anal-
ogy using inventor Herman Casler's early twentieth century
mutoscope, which involved taking a series of single assess-
ment cross-sectional snapshots of an object in motion, arrang-
ing the snapshots on cards, and then flipping the photos in
succession so that the cascading imagery of cross-sectional
snapshots might be converted into a primitive movie of the
object in motion (http://www.flipbook.info/viewers.php, last
accessed 23 October 2014). Here, our mutoscope approach
involves arranging each set of data from each re-sampling of
the nationally representative cohort in relation to strata or
subgroups defined by the age at assessment, the year of
assessment, and sex (male vs female). The 12-year-old boys
in the nationally representative sample of 2004 form one
stratum and the 12-year-old girls of 2004 form another stratum,
allowing direct comparison of PM practices, such as the LTF
facet. Then, the 13-year-old boys sampled and assessed for the
first time in 2005 provide a snapshot view of PM practices
when that same cohort had passed the 13th birthday, and the
13-year-old girls sampled and assessed for the first time in
2005 provide a snapshot view of PM when they had passed the
13th birthday (i.e., with a new sample of cohort members). The
remaining strata of boys and girls are formed in a similar
fashion, age by age, and year by year, through to 2009, when
the national cohort of 12-year-olds in 2004 reach age 17 years.
This mutoscope approach to repeated "panel study"
data yields a trace of cross-sectional single assessment
snapshots of a cohort's experience from one age to the
next, with each member of the sample assessed once and
only once. As such, this research approach to understand-
ing PM stability and change reduces all sample attrition
problems faced when trying to track down and re-assess a
cohort sampled just one time, and also brings potential
measurement reactivity and interdependence to a mini-
mum (see Anthony 2010). This approach constrains inter-
dependence of observations in repeated measures re-
search--i.e., interdependence such that an individual's
measured values of PM at time t+1 might be found to
depend upon his or her measured values of PM at a prior
time t. Overall, this approach creates a novel way to test
developmental hypotheses about male-female differences
in PM practices as the cohort makes transitions into and
through the adolescent years, somewhat conceptually sim-
ilar to but fundamentally different from an accelerated
longitudinal cohort study design.
Measures
The multi-module ACASI assessment included five different
items pertinent to adept monitoring and supervision by par-
ents, each of which was included in the PM construct used in
this study as a discrete categorical indicator variable with four-
point Likert scale levels from 1 (never) to 4 (always). These
items tapped how often in the past year parents had limited
time with friends (M=2.94; SD=1.08), limited time watching
television (M=2.07; SD=1.06), checked homework (M=
3.20; SD=0.95), helped with homework (M=3.28; SD=
0.99), or assigned work or chores (M=3.33; SD=0.78). A
particular strength of these items is that they are all malleable
and modifiable aspects of parenting, at least theoretically
amenable to parent education and interventions.
Analysis Plan
We chose to integrate the description of our analysis/
estimation steps with presentation of results in order to
describe the steps and their results with greater clarity.
The analysis/estimation strategy was preceded by Tukey-
style exploratory data analysis (EDA) to illuminate mar-
ginal distributions of these study variables. Model-fitting
steps are depicted in cartoon-like Fig. 1a­c, as described
in the Results section. Anonymous reviewers and the
journal's methods editorial staff suggested some of the
post-estimation exploratory data analysis steps described
below. All analysis/estimation steps were completed using

Results
Analytic Strategy
Our plan for data analysis was organized in relation to a
standard multi-step approach that concluded with a multiple
indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) model within an explor-
atory structural equation modeling (ESEM) framework using
MPlus, after EDA. As outlined recently by Asparouhov and
Muthen (2009), ESEM allows for greater model flexibility
than confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) while it also includes
more pre-defined information than exploratory factor analysis
(EFA). In addition, although the MIMIC model has been most
often used within item response theory to detect item bias in
the form of differential item functioning (DIF), we used it in
the context of this study to test our specific substantive hy-
potheses about selective male-female LTF differences (see
Gallo et al. 1994; Edelen et al. 2009). Use of MIMIC model-
ing within an ESEM framework made it possible for us to
explore associations between age, sex, and PM, and also to
shed light on inter-relationships linking age, sex, and LTF
while holding constant levels of the general PM construct, as
described in our introductory overview of the research ap-
proach. In these analyses, the metric of the latent PM construct
is uncertain, and we do not claim that the metric for boys is
exactly the same as the metric for girls. In this initial explor-
atory study with the mutoscope approach, we decided not to
confirm measurement equivalence for the 12 subgroups under
study (boys vs girls across each of six age-year strata), as
would be required to draw more definitive inferences about
levels of the latent PM construct. For this reason, our descrip-
tion of estimates gives emphasis to the slope estimates for the
paths leading directly toward the LTF indicator, which is
anchored in the observed item response categories from 1
to 4 (i.e., not necessarily ordinal, but at least ordered
category values).
Preliminary Modeling Step 1: Male-Female Differences
Generally
In an initial estimation step, we fit to the data a parsimonious
regression model for complex survey sample data that is based
on the possibly over-simplified assumptions that age and year
make no difference. The resulting "common regression slope"
estimate of the male-female difference in PM levels borrows
information across all years and age groups. We then elabo-
rated that model to allow for the possibility of a male-female
difference in the LTF facet of monitoring, also summarized in
the form of a common regression slope based on all ages and
all years, and on the over-simplified assumptions. Figure 1a
shows the conceptual model with the direct effect path from
the sex variable to the LTF indicator, as well as the indirect
path via the PM construct.
The parsimonious regression model used to estimate male-
female differences across all years and age groups was based
upon an assumption that PM and LTF might not vary for males
and females across year or age group. This model fits the data
no better than moderately well, 2 (8, n=18,511)=810.7,
p<0.001; CFI=0.88; RMSEA=0.07 (90 % confidence interval
(CI)=0.07; 0.08). A table is not needed to summarize the two
slope estimates from this model. The primary estimate
disclosed similarly robust male-female differences in relation
to the LTF variable (estimated slope, b=-0.145; standard error,
SE=0.023; Taylor series p<0.001). Parents seem to be more
lax in their limits set for boys' time with friends, with PM level
held constant under this model. The exploratory slope estimate
of secondary importance indexes possible male-female differ-
ences in PM level, has a positive sign, and is statistically robust
(b=0.06; SE=0.03; p=0.04; Table 2). Subject to an untested
assumption of measurement equivalence, this secondary slope
suggests that parents might be monitoring boys at higher levels
than girls across all age cohorts. We will return to this interest-
ing topic in our Discussion section.
Preliminary Modeling Step 2: Age Differences
In the next estimation step, we posited a model that was a
more realistic portrayal of our expectations for age-related
variations, allowing for the possibility that an age adjustment
might lead to a change in the estimated direct path being used
to estimate male-female differences in the LTF facet of PM.
This modeling goal was accomplished by adding dummy-
coded variables that represent the cohort as sampled at each
age (Fig. 1b). For example, the first age variable in the series
(a4) coded 12-year-old respondents in 2004 as 1 with all
others coded 0, the second age variable (a5) coded 13-
year-old respondents in 2005 as 1 with all others coded 0,
and so on.
With the model re-specified with these age terms, the fit
statistics improved somewhat, 2 (23, n=18,511)=1121.8,
p<0.001; CFI=0.81; RMSEA=0.05 (90 % CI=0.048;
0.053). With PM level held constant under this model, the
slope to estimate male-female differences in LTF did not
change appreciably from the b=-0.145 value found in step
1 (step 2, b=-0.15; p<0.001; data not shown in a table). There
was an incrementally positive slope for LTF from the 12-year-
old cohort sample onward. LTF slope estimates for age co-
horts 13­17 were observed as tangibly larger than values
observed for the 12-year-old cohort, but Wald tests of param-
eter constraints designed to test for differences revealed that
the incremental differences age by age were not appreciably
Prev Sci
different from one another relative to conventional standards
(i.e., all p>0.05 for age 13 vs 14, 14 vs 15, etc.).
With respect to our exploratory estimation of slopes lead-
ing toward the latent PM construct, there was an inverse slope
estimate year by year, when looking across the samples of the
cohort, from 12-year-olds sampled in 2004 to counterparts in
the sample of 17-year-olds in 2009. Subject to our untested
assumption of measurement equivalence, the inverse slopes
indicate that PM level for 12-year-olds in 2004 was higher
than the PM level for 13-year-olds in 2005. Also subject to
this assumption, an inverse slope estimate also was seen
across the span of time as the 12-year-old cohort observed in
2004 moved forward across later age and time strata (data not
shown in a table).
Primary Estimation Step: Variations Across Sex-Age
Subgroups
In this primary estimation step, we posited a model that more
completely expressed our expectation that with overall PM
level held constant via the regression model, the parents might
relax LTF differentially for boys as we look across the strata
from the 12-year-olds in 2004 to the 17-year olds in 2009, but
this might not be the case for girls. Here, the approach in-
volved forming dummy-coded variables with product terms
for the sex-age subgroups from age 13 to age 17 (Fig. 1c). The
resulting model yielded the following model fit statistics: 2
(38, n=18,511)=637.0, p<0.001; CFI=0.83; RMSEA=0.03
(90 % CI=0.027; 0.031).
Most central to our primary hypothesis about male-
female differences in LTF values under this model, there
was no male-female difference in the 2004 contrast of
boys and girls age 12 years (b=-0.01, SE=0.06, p=
0.89, upper left cell of Table 3). Even so, as can be seen
by following the diagonal trace downward and to the
right, the hypothesized male-female difference in the
LTF facet of parenting was seen to emerge and to be
statistically robust in the other contrasts (i.e., in mid-
later adolescence). For each age cohort across the adoles-
cent age range from 13 to 17 years, boys' time with
friends was restricted at lower levels as compared to girls
of the same age (p<0.05; Table 3 diagonal trace). These
results serve as evidentiary support in favor of our prima-
ry LTF-related hypothesis that there might be no differ-
ence in LTF for pre-teen boys versus girls but that LTF
differences might be substantial for the 16- and 17-year-
olds in this cohort, with PM level held constant under the
model. We also note a similar male-female difference in
LTF for the 13­15-year-olds in this cohort.
Subject to the untested measurement equivalence assump-
tion, we looked for evidence of systematic variation in overall
PM levels. Under this model, there was no statistically robust

male-female difference in PM level in early adolescence at age
12 years in 2004 (b=-0.03; SE=0.07; p=0.73). Nonetheless,
a statistically robust male-female difference emerged in each
subsequent year, but with an unexpected outcome. Namely, if
indeed the measurement metric is equivalent, the ob-
served overall parental monitoring levels seem to be
higher for boys than for girls from ages 13 to 17 years
(see Table 2, diagonal trace).
If one were to assume PM measurement equivalence across
all 12 subgroups, the evidence shown in Table 2 (above
diagonal trace) would be consistent with generally hypothe-
sized expectations about age and PM levels. Estimates in the
above diagonal (upper right) cells of Table 2 are for boys.
These exploratory estimates suggest an age-associated decline
in overall PM levels for boys contrasted from one age to the
next, beginning with contrasts between 13- and 15-year-olds
(b=-0.40; p<0.001) and continuing to contrasts between 16-
and 17-year-olds (b=-0.30; p<0.001). PM levels for boys
might have increased slightly between the ages of 12 and
13 years before beginning to decrease. Estimates for girls, as
shown in the lower left below diagonal cells of Table 2,
disclose a roughly similar pattern. To illustrate (again with
an assumption of measurement equivalence across sub-
groups), the girls at age 12 years in 2004 were found to have
higher PM levels under this model as compared to girls at each
older age. Table 2 (lower left below diagonal) shows evidence
suggesting PM levels at statistically significant lower values
for girls across the independent samples drawn 1 year after the
other (e.g., b=-0.30 for girls in 2005 vs girls in 2004,
p<0.001; b=-1.18 for girls in 2009 vs girls in 2004,
p<0.001). If confirmed in future research, these findings
would tend to support maturational model, possibly with
general PM construct levels decreasing over time for boys
and girls.
Discussion
Brief Summary of Findings
In this study, we investigated hypothesized age-specific male-
female differences in the limit time with friends facet of parental
monitoring with PM held constant (as measured by the LTF item
as well as items on limiting time watching television, checking
homework, helping with homework, and assigning work or
chores). Our main hypothesis concerned the LTF facet of the
PM construct, and the findings confirm our initial expectation of

male-female LTF differences, with exploration of possible male-
female and age-related variations in PM levels.
The general picture is one of clear male-female differences
in the LTF facet of parenting of adolescent daughters versus
sons in recent years within the USA. The successive cross-
sectional snapshots from early-late adolescence showed evi-
dence of more permissive parenting with respect to allowing
sons to spend time with friends as compared to daughters
spending time with friends, but not at age 12 years, in models
holding constant overall PM levels age by age. This evidence,
coupled with findings from our previous study that LTF risk
differences for newly incident drug use were at least as large
as male-female differences in newly incident drug use, may
help support and provide a rationale for a specific focus
on the LTF facet in parenting interventions and in future
drug use prevention trials (Seedall and Anthony, 2013).
In our more exploratory findings on overall PM levels, we
did not place emphasis on the possibility of male-female
differences, due to unresolved measurement equivalence is-
sues. The evidence is consistent with developmental or
maturation-related variations such that the levels of overall
monitoring might generally decrease across successive ages,
for both males and females in adolescence, but more work on
the overall PM measurement equivalence assumption is need-
ed before firm conclusions should be drawn.
Limitations
Before a more detailed discussion of these results and their
implications, several of the more important of this study's
limitations merit attention. One limitation worth noting is the
study's cross-sectional sample in each year, which provides a
population-averaged snapshot but not a subject-specific view
of an individual's change over time. It has been necessary to
use the population-averaged mutoscope approach and to yoke
the successive snapshots in sequence in order to gain a longi-
tudinal view of the 12-year-old cohort sampled and measured
in 2004, as that cohort matured out to age 17 years.
In relation to limitations, we also are reminded of an issue
raised by Gault-Sherman (2012)--namely, the bidirectionality
of parent­offspring relationships that cannot be fully illumi-
nated in any cross-sectional research project. Nonetheless,
here, in this study, we are quite confident that PM and LTF
values have not altered the values of the male-female sex
variable, nor the age variable.
Against this background information on limitations, we
note that a counterbalanced strength is in these annual surveys
that seek nationally representative samples of each age cohort
under study in the USA. As a result, although the 12-year-olds
in the 2004 survey are never re-sampled or re-assessed in
successive years, each year's sample is nationally representa-
tive of the nation's children and adolescents, year by year. Via
inspection of year-to-year progress of each age cohort, it is
possible to surmount disadvantages faced in longitudinal re-
search, including differentially selective attrition, as well as
potential reactivity in assessments, both of which sometimes
limit interpretation in longitudinal samples (Anthony 2010).
Of course, despite strengths of this type, we acknowledge that
evidence from longitudinal research projects provides more
information about within-individual differences, which al-
ways will serve as useful complements to epidemiological
investigations of this type.
We also would like to highlight two other issues related to
the research approach used in the NSDUH to assess PM. One
aspect of research approach involves an interpretation of what
is being measured. From one perspective, the important con-
structs under study are adept parental monitoring and super-
vision, and limit setting about time with friends, which are
being measured by what the sons and daughters report. From
another perspective, we can view the boys' and girls' re-
sponses to the survey assessments as a measure of what they
perceive about how and how well they are being monitored by
their parents (e.g., see Kerr et al. 2010; Stattin and Kerr 2000).
That is, in this formulation, the construct might be said to
be "perceived level of parental monitoring" or "perceived
LTF," as opposed to actual "levels of PM and LTF." We
surmise that each reader of this research report might choose
to adopt one perspective versus another, with corresponding
constraints on the interpretation of the findings, and with
allowance for the possibility that it is the reporting of PM
and LTF that varies from one age to the next, as opposed to our
own interpretation that it is the actual PM and LTF values that
vary from one age to the next. Deliberately designed experi-
ments will be required to tease apart whether the important
variables are "what is perceived," versus "what is disclosed,"
versus "what actually was experienced."
We also have noted that all of the five PM items used in the
NSDUH assessment represent parental behaviors than can be
readily modified, and this is an important feature of the
NSDUH assessment from the standpoint of future public
health interventions. Nonetheless, it also is important to ac-
knowledge that these five items do not necessarily capture all
facets of adept parental monitoring. In this regard, we concur
that PM might be cast in future research as a multi-
dimensional construct based upon mutually influencing parent
and child behaviors, with an allowance that a PM level as
perceived and reported by a child (or by a parent) might be
different from a PM level measured via an externally verifi-
able measurement device (Kerr et al. 2010). Whereas the
present nationally representative NSDUH sample survey
has remarkable strengths in relation to external generaliz-
ability and the sample space, a research project focused
more specifically on parenting of adolescents almost cer-
tainly would have a more comprehensive PM and LTF
assessment, making it possible to probe the PM and LTF
issues in more depth than has been possible in this
Prev Sci
nationally representative sample survey context. We ac-
knowledge that the overall PM levels for girls might be
found to be greater than the overall PM levels for boys, if
the NSDUH had employed a more comprehensive PM
survey module, and if measurement equivalence can be
substantiated.
Overall Implications
Notwithstanding limitations such as these, the study findings
are of interest for a variety of reasons, including external
generalizability of the evidence, traced back to a nationally
representative study sample of adolescents in the community,
as well as the strengths of a standardized assessment plan
across the multiple survey years and the size of the samples
under study. As for implications, we have chosen to concen-
trate our attention on the possibility that the LTF facet of
parental monitoring might deserve more careful attention in
clinical and public health population­oriented outcomes re-
search, perhaps with greater attention to the LTF facet specif-
ically within the context of preventive interventions that seek
to improve overall PM in a more general way. We speculate
that the LTF facet might be a crucial component of PM and
parental supervision in general, with an important functional
interdependence--i.e., interdependent with and perhaps de-
terminative of the age at which sons and daughters are first
exposed to a chance to try alcohol or tobacco or to experiment
with cannabis, opioids, or other internationally regulated
drugs. This is a research question to which our attention now
will turn, given supportive evidence of LTF variations by sex
and by age, as discovered in this new look at parental moni-
toring and supervision of adolescents.
It is in the context of tobacco and other drug prevention
research that the value of an LTF focus might be seen. To
illustrate, we hope that trialists will consider our previously
mentioned "micro-trials" approach to assess whether PM in-
tervention impact on these drug outcomes might be strength-
ened when a random subset of participating parents is chosen
for SMS text messaging or other interventions specifically
directed to the LTF facet. That is, consistent with a micro-
trials probe into the potential mechanisms of intervention
effect, there could be an overall randomization to the PM
intervention (e.g., parent education sessions and DVDs) and
to the control condition, and then a more individualized SMS
messaging about LTF might be assigned at random to those
receiving the PM intervention. In this way, the specific utility
of LTF might be seen in trial outcomes such as a delayed first
chance to smoke tobacco or try other drugs, reduced levels of
affiliation with drug-using peers, and delayed or reduced onset
of underage smoking or other precocious drug use, as
gauged against any potentially salubrious background ef-
fects of an intervention directed toward increasing the
more general PM levels.
Conclusion
Overall, this study sheds light on potentially important male-
female differences in parenting behaviors that might foster
new and more probing research into the LTF facet of
monitoring and supervision during late childhood and early
adolescence. Our findings provide additional evidence for
what Axinn et al. (2011) call a double standard, with girls
being limited more on issues relating to courtship or family
formation. It was beyond the scope of our current study to
address whether these male-female differences are associated
with more positive or negative outcomes (such as involvement
with alcohol, tobacco, or the internationally regulated drugs).
Nonetheless, we are hopeful that the results from this study
will foster new research on the potential public health signif-
icance of the observed variations, including prevention trials
with interventions that have a strengthened focus upon specific
PM facets, such as limiting time with friends. Through new
prevention experiments of this type, it should become possible
to estimate the degree to which it is LTF per se that conveys the
effect of parenting interventions, or whether these effects are
mediated entirely by what the adolescent is willing to disclose
to parents, or what the adolescent perceives about parental
monitoring. In this way, the prevention research on parenting
can be used to shed light on fundamental issues of adolescent
development, including the male-female differences observed
here.
