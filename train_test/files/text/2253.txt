Immigrants Contributed An
Estimated $115.2 Billion More
To The Medicare Trust Fund
Than They Took Out In 2002­09
ABSTRACT Many immigrants in the United States are working-age
taxpayers; few are elderly beneficiaries of Medicare. This demographic
profile suggests that immigrants may be disproportionately subsidizing
the Medicare Trust Fund, which supports payments to hospitals and
institutions under Medicare Part A. For immigrants and others, we
tabulated Trust Fund contributions and withdrawals (that is, Trust Fund
expenditures on their behalf) using multiple years of data from the
Current Population Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. In
2009 immigrants made 14.7 percent of Trust Fund contributions but
accounted for only 7.9 percent of its expenditures--a net surplus of
$13.8 billion. In contrast, US-born people generated a $30.9 billion
deficit. Immigrants generated surpluses of $11.1­$17.2 billion per year
between 2002 and 2009, resulting in a cumulative surplus of
$115.2 billion. Most of the surplus from immigrants was contributed by
noncitizens and was a result of the high proportion of working-age
taxpayers in this group. Policies that restrict immigration may deplete
Medicare's financial resources.
Politicians and others are concerned
that Medicare might not be sustain-
able, given current projections of
health care spending growth, the
surge in enrollment driven by the
aging baby-boom generation, and the dimin-
ished size of the working-age population paying
into the program through payroll taxes. The role
that immigrants play in funding Medicare and
their use of the program is not well understood.
Because Medicare accounts for 21 percent of all
annual US health care expenditures,1 knowing
moreprecisely how immigrantsfactor into Medi-
care revenues and expenditures is important to
ongoing policy discussions.
Medicare is financed through general reve-
nues, payroll taxes, beneficiary premiums, and
other sources, including taxes on Social Security
benefits and payments from states. Medicare has
two trust funds, the Hospital Insurance Trust
Fund and the Supplementary Medical Insur-
ance Trust Fund.2 The Hospital Insurance (HI)
Trust Fund primarily finances inpatient care
through Medicare Part A; it receives most of
itsincome frompayroll taxesand intereston past
surpluses generated from those taxes. The
Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust
Fund primarily pays for Medicare Part B, which
covers physician services (both inpatient and
outpatient) and outpatient care. Despite its
name, the SMI Trust Fund is not a trust fund in
the usual sense of the term; it is fully funded an-
nually by enrollee premiums and yearly congres-
sional appropriations from general revenues.
The most recent annual report from the
Medicare Board of Trustees projected that the
HI Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2024.2 At that
point, revenues and assets will not be sufficient
to cover the full costs of the Medicare program.
Studies have found that immigrants use less

health care than US-born individuals,3,4 even in
some public programs.4,5 However, because pre-
vious studies have not tabulated immigrants'
contributions to health care funding, concerns
remain that immigrants may be a financial drain
on the health care system.
We used nationally representative data on
Medicare spending, income, and taxation to de-
termine HI Trust Fund contributions and expen-
ditures attributable to the US-born, immigrants,
and noncitizen immigrants. We then calculated
the net trust fund surpluses or deficits attribut-
able to each group.
Study Data And Methods
Data Sources We determined HI Trust Fund
contributions from the March supplements to
the Current Population Survey(CPS) for 2003­
10 (the 2010 survey included 209,802 respon-
dents). The CPS, conducted jointly by the Census
Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, pro-
vides nationally representative data for the
civilian noninstitutionalized population.6 Each
year's survey includes questions on personal in-
come for the previous calendar year, as well as on
place of birth and citizenship status.
We determined Medicare expenditures using
the 2002­09 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys
(MEPS) conducted by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (our 2009 sample included
36,333 respondents for whom we could identify
nativity status). This survey provides detailed
health care spending data for a representative
sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation and enables the identification of Medi-
care expenditures.
We linked data from MEPS to data from the
National Health Interview Survey (from which
the MEPS sample is drawn) to confirm nativity
and citizenship status. A detailed description of
our definitions and data sources appears in the
online Appendix.7
Contributions, Expenditures, Surpluses,
And Deficits The CPS includes detailed individ-
ual-level income data, allowing us to calculate
immigrants' and others' shares of 2009 tax con-
tributions to the HI Trust Fund. Most contribu-
tions are from payroll taxes, but some are from
income taxes on Social Security benefits col-
lected from higher-income beneficiaries. The
Appendix provides details of our HI Trust Fund
contribution and expenditure calculations.7
SMI Trust Fund spending is not paid for by the
HI Trust Fund and hence was not used in our
calculations of trust fund finances. However, we
also report immigrants' and others' shares of
most categories of this spending (see the
Appendix for details).7
To generate dollar estimates for HI Trust Fund
contributions and expenditures, we multiplied
immigrants' and nonimmigrants' shares of total
contributions and expenditures by the Medicare
Trustees' estimates of total 2009 HI Trust Fund
revenues and expenditures.8 We calculated each
group's total net surplus or deficit by subtracting
its HI Trust Fund expenditures from its HI Trust
Fund contributions. In calculating per capita fig-
ures, we used CPS data to estimate population
figures. Finally, we repeated our analysis sepa-
rately for citizen and noncitizen immigrants as
well as for two age groups, people ages 18­64 and
people ages 65 and older.
Although we report results principally for
2009, we replicated all analyses for each year
in the period 2002­08.
Statistical Analysis We determined signifi-
cance using chi-square tests for proportions and
linear regressions for dollar estimates (includ-
ing time trends). As explained in the Appendix,7
we performed sensitivity analyses employing al-
ternative regression modeling strategies that
might be appropriate for highly skewed data
such as health expenditures. These yielded vir-
tually identical results. The Institutional Review
Board of Cambridge Health Alliance exempted
this study from review.
Limitations Several limitations of our study
should be noted. Our data may undercount non-
citizens' surplus since undocumented immi-
grants may avoid government surveys such as
the Current Population Survey. The impact of
this possible undercount on our estimate of pay-
roll tax contributions is hard to quantify. How-
ever, the Social Security Administration's Office
of the Chief Actuary estimated that undocu-
mented immigrants contributed a net of $12 bil-
lion to the Social Security Retirement Trust Fund
in 2007.9 Since about one-fifth of the federal
payroll tax goes to Medicare and four-fifths to
Social Security, the estimate suggests that un-
documented immigrants' net contribution to
Medicare is about $2.5 billion. Although un-
documented immigrants are probably also
underrepresented in the MEPS data, this should
have little impact on our findings since Medicare
expenditures on their behalf are minimal.
We conservatively credited revenue from HI
Trust Fund interest to immigrants in proportion
to their tax contributions in 2009. However, in-
terest accrues on surpluses from prior years.
Hence, crediting interest in proportion to past
surpluses would raise our estimate of immi-
grants' share of HI Trust Fund contributions.
Conversely, we assumed that other sources of
HI Trust Fund revenues, such as general tax rev-
enue and premiums, were proportional to rev-
enue from payroll taxes. Although we have no

data on immigrants' share of these revenue
sources, they account for little of the trust fund's
income: Premium contributionsaccount for only
1.3 percent and general tax revenues for just
1.0 percent. On the expenditure side, we made
the intuitively reasonable but unproven assump-
tion that immigrants' share of skilled nursing
facility and hospice expenditures, which are not
included in the MEPS data, were proportional
to their share of inpatient, home health, and
Medicare Advantage expenditures.
Study Results
Population In 2009 immigrants constituted
13.6 percent of the US population, according
to the CPS. As expected for two nationally
representative samples, the CPS and MEPS sam-
ples had similar demographic characteristics,
including age, sex, race or ethnicity, insurance,
nativity, citizenship status, and number of years
in the United States (Exhibit 1).
Contributions, Expenditures, And Net
Surplus Or Deficit By Nativity Status In
2009 immigrants contributed $33.1 billion to
the HI Trust Fund, or 14.7 percent of all contri-
butions, and were responsible for $19.3 billion of
its expenditures, or 7.9 percent (Exhibit 2).
Immigrants accounted for 4.8 percent of hospi-
talization expenditures; 14.2 percent of home
health expenditures (a figure that is based on
small numbers and should be interpreted cau-
tiously); and 11.8 percent of trust fund ex-
penditures on Medicare Advantage premiums.
Among Medicare enrollees, average expendi-
tures were $1,465 lower for immigrants ($3,923)
than for the US-born ($5,388)--a difference that
was of borderline significance (p ¼ 0:05).
Immigrants generated a trust fund surplus of
$13.8 billion in 2009. In contrast, the US-born
generated a deficit of $30.9 billion. Noncitizen
immigrants (about 7.1 percent of the US resi-
dent population) contributed a net surplus of
$10.1 billion, or $466 per capita (Exhibit 3), ac-
counting for most of the surplus from immi-
grants. When stratified by age group, per capita
net contributions by US-born people of working
age (ages 18­64) and retirement age (ages 65
and older) did not differ significantly from im-
migrants' net contributions. For the younger

group, the per capita net contributions were
$1,424 for the US-born and $1,332 for immi-
grants. For the older group, the figures in both
cases were deficits rather than surpluses:
$-3,333 for the US-born and $-2,099 for
immigrants.
Immigrants accounted for 10.6 percent of SMI
Trust Fund expenditures, including 11.3 percent
of Medicare Advantage premiums, 14.2 percent
of home health agency expenditures (an esti-
mate based on small numbers), 10.8 percent of
prescription drug expenditures, 6.8 percent of
physician expenditures, and 7.8 percent of out-
patient (including emergency department)
expenditures. Percapita SMI Trust Fund expend-
itures for immigrants ($721) were $175 lower
than for the US-born ($896)--a difference that
was not significant (p ¼ 0:11). Noncitizen immi-
grants' per capita SMI Trust Fund expenditures
of $295 were $601 lower than those of the US-
born (p < 0:001). As noted above, we did not use
these expenditures in our calculation of HI Trust
Fund finances.
Trends Over Time In each of the years from
2002 to 2009, immigrants contributed a surplus
to the HI Trust Fund (Exhibit 4), generating a
total surplus of $115.2 billion during the period.
Their contributions remained largely unchanged
over time. During the same period, the net trust
fund contributions (contributions minus ex-
penditures) for US-born people declined, gener-
ating a deficit of $28.1 billion.
Discussion
Immigrants, particularly noncitizens, heavily
subsidize Medicare. In 2009 immigrants con-
tributed $13.8 billion more to the HI Trust
Fund than it paid out on their behalf (Exhibit 4).
Most of this surplus came from noncitizens.
Between 2002 and 2009 immigrants' cumulative
surplus contributions totaled $115.2 billion.
Immigrants pay into the HI Trust Fund in sev-
eral ways. Those with legal status contribute
through payroll taxes under valid Social Secu-
rity numbers. Undocumented immigrants often
pay payroll taxes under Social Security numbers
tied to invented names or belonging to someone
else,9 because to comply with federal law employ-
ers must obtain a Social Security number from
every employee. Less frequently, undocumented
immigrantspay self-employmenttaxes (inlieu of
payroll taxes) under individual tax identification
numbers, which allows them to claim credit for
their contributions should they eventually ob-
tain legal status.10
Immigrants generate a surplus for Medicare
primarily because so many of them are working-
age adults and the group has a high labor-force
participationrate--a combination thatgenerates
large payroll tax payments. Our analysis of the
2010 CPS data showed that noncitizen immi-
grants were younger and more likely to be of
working age than were citizen immigrants,
which is not surprising given that it takes years
to become a naturalized citizen. This partially
explains noncitizen immigrants' particularly
large HI Trust Fund surpluses.
In 2009 the dependency ratio--the ratio of
working-age to retirement-age people, or those
ages 18­64 to older people--among immigrants
was 6.5 to 1, compared to 4.7 to 1 for the US-born.
Noncitizen immigrants had a particularly high

dependency ratio, 12.4 to 1, reflecting their rel-
ative youth. Because many noncitizens eventu-
ally become naturalized at older ages, this last
estimate is biased upward. Although individual
immigrants may have lower lifetime earnings
than US-born people, depending on their age
at arrival, the high proportion of working-age
adult immigrants results in large excess pay-
ments to the HI Trust Fund.
The recent drop in Mexican immigration11 and
the overall aging of the US population may even-
tually reduce immigrants' dependency ratio, and
hence their surplus contributions to Medicare.
However, this source of surplus contributions
seems likely to continue for some time. The
dependency ratio among immigrants did not fall
between 1995 and 2010, according to our analy-
sis of CPS data; the large cohort of Mexican im-
migrants from the 1990s and 2000s will not
reach retirement age for decades; immigration
of mostly working-age individuals from Asia con-
tinues to grow;12,13 and the Census Bureau pro-
jects that net immigration (both absolutely and
as a share of the US population) will continue to
increase for the next eighteen years and will be
higher in 2060 than it is now.14,15
Several factors other than age likely play a role
in immigrants' Medicare surplus. First, some
immigrants who are eligible for Medicare may
not use it because they retire to their country of
origin.16 Elderly immigrants may be ineligible for
Medicare because they have not worked the re-
quired forty quarter-years in the United States,17
lack legal status, or--if they are legal residents--
do not meet the five-year (legal) residency re-
quirement of the Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.
Immigrants also cost Medicare less--a conse-
quence of both their lower rates of enrollment
and their lower expenditures once enrolled.
These lower expenditures may reflect the under-
representation of immigrants among the "oldest
old," those ages eighty-five and older. Differenc-
es in health status per se probably don't explain
these findings: Although immigrants arrive in
the United States healthier than the US-born,18
immigrants' health advantage has eroded by age
sixty-five.18,19
However, poor access to care among elderly
immigrants may play a role in their low use of
Medicare.19 Previous studies have found that
immigrants--especially noncitizens20--use less
health care than do the US-born.3,4,21 This dispar-
ity has remained largely unchanged over time5
and has been observed among the publicly
insured, the privately insured, and the un-
insured.3­5
Our 2009 findings are not an anomaly. Im-
migrants provided surpluses to the HI Trust
Fund in every year between 2002 and 2009
(Exhibit 4), and this surplus was relatively
constant.
Our study is the first of which we are aware to
quantify immigrants' share of contributions,
and therefore the net surplus or deficit provided
by immigrants, to a US health care sector. The
surplus, if any, that immigrants provide to the
health care system as a whole--or to programs
other than Medicare--is not known. Although
most political discourse regarding immigrant
health care financing has focused on uncompen-
sated care, that care accounts for a far smaller
proportion of nationalhealthcarespending than
Medicare does (2 percent versus 21 percent).1,22
Immigrants may withdraw more resources
than they contribute to some government ser-
vices. However, our finding that immigrants
heavily subsidize the HI Trust Fund should
raise skepticism about the widespread assump-
tion that immigrants consistently drain public
resources.
Conclusion
Having ourselves witnessed immigrants dying
needlessly because of lack of health care, we
(and many of our colleagues) are motivated by
the belief that all patients have a human right to

health care. But economic concerns--including
the worry that immigrants are driving up US
health care costs--have often dominated the de-
bate over immigration. Our data offer a new per-
spective on these economic concerns.
Policies that reduce immigration would almost
certainly weaken Medicare's financial health,
while an increasing flow of immigrants might
bolster its sustainability. Because Social Secu-
rity's eligibility criteria and payroll tax­based
funding closely track those of Medicare, our
findings support the argument that immigration
helps sustain Social Security.
Providing a path to citizenship for currently
undocumented immigrants would affect Medi-
care's finances in multiple ways. It would likely
increase payroll tax collections by reducing
immigrants' "off the books" employment and
removing barriers that keep them out of higher-
paying jobs. But in the long term it would prob-
ably increase the number of immigrants eligible
for Medicare, and hence expenditures on their
behalf.
However, the age structure of the immigrant
population is far more important than either of
these factors. Encouraging a steady flow of
young immigrants would help offset the aging
of the US population and the health care financ-
ing challenge that it presents.
