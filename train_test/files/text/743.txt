Analyses by race and ethnicity of several important dimensions of labor market
behavior have been constrained in the past by limited samples of the African American and
Hispanic populations. This article uses data from the first wave of the Health and Retirement
Survey, which oversamples these populations, to compare the retirement plans of African
American, Hispanic, and white married men and women. Findings suggest that retirement
expectations may accurately forecast retirement behavior and that the differences by race
and ethnicity, as well as by gender, that are evident in retirement plans are likely to be
reflected in retirement outcomes.

Do people think seriously and systematically about
the future? The answer to this question has impor-
tant implications for both researchers and policyma-
kers. Recent changes in Social Security, for example,
were designed to increase the labor supply of elderly
persons, but the outcomes will depend on whether
individuals take into account their future benefit
stream in making employment decisions. If they are
myopic and consider only current benefits, policies
such as increases in the delayed retirement credit for
postponing Social Security benefit receipt beyond
age 65 will not have the intended effect (See Reimers
& Honig, 1996, for evidence that this is likely to be the
case for men, but not for women).
The degree to which poverty among the elderly
arises from a lack of financial planning in preretire-
ment years may also be determined with information
on household time horizons. A relatively new and
related issue is whether married women's increased
labor force participation will translate into lower pov-
erty rates among retirees. Recent evidence suggests
that divorce results in a larger decline in the ratio of
income to needs of older women than the death of a
spouse (Quinn, 1993). If married women fail to take
into account both the higher divorce probabilities of
recent years and the effect of their current employ-
ment decisions on their own retirement income,

there is little reason to expect a significant decline in
poverty among older women. African American and
Hispanic women are particularly vulnerable because
the relatively low wealth accumulation in these
households implies that divorced women will have
few assets in retirement other than those related to
their own past earnings.
This article examines responses in the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS; Juster & Suzman, 1995)
regarding retirement expectations to determine
whether workers think coherently about the future.
Although expectations cannot be matched with real-
izations until additional waves of the survey have
been collected, the consistency of responses regard-
ing retirement plans can be evaluated, and expected
retirement functions can be compared with findings
on actual retirement. If expected and observed re-
tirement functions are similar, we may assume that
the same underlying behavioral model generates
both expectations and realizations and thus have
more confidence that retirement expectations accu-
rately predict future employment status.
In this article, I first discuss evidence on the valid-
ity of the expectations data in previous surveys and
then examine the responses, which take the form of
subjective probability statements, to expectations
questions in the HRS. The subjective probability of
working full time after age 62 is then estimated as a
function of known determinants of observed retire-
ment on samples of married men and women among
three demographic groups: non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic African Americans, and Hispanics.
Although there is a large literature examining the
retirement decisions of white men (for a survey, see
Quinn, Burkhauser, & Myers, 1990), and a few stud-
ies on white women (Hanoch & Honig, 1983; Honig,
1985; Pozzebon & Mitchell, 1989), little is known
regarding the factors that influence the behavior of
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 373
African American and Hispanic women and men.
There are reasons to believe, moreover, that their
behavior may differ from that of whites. In the HRS,
we observe substantial differences among the three
groups in retirement rates and in several of the fac-
tors that influence retirement such as health, health
insurance coverage, and eligibility for employer pen-
sions and Social Security (Gustman, Mitchell, &
Steinmeier, 1994; Honig, 1994). The only economic
study to include an analysis of the retirement be-
havior of African American men concludes that dif-
ferences with whites are due either to different
preferences for nonmarket activities, suggesting un-
observed cultural differences, or to different charac-
teristics of jobs (Gustman & Steinmeier, 1986).
Among younger African American and white married
women, differences in labor force participation have
been attributed to cultural differences between the
two populations (Reimers, 1985). Thus, it is impor-
tant to examine retirement expectations separately
by race and ethnicity, as well as by gender. Whether
observed differences may be attributable to cultural
factors not accounted for by measured characteris-
tics will become evident with further study.
The findings in this article suggest that a common
behavioral model appears to underlie both retire-
ment expectations and outcomes. Several measures
of the expected net reward to work, nonlabor in-
come, and the value of nommarket time are signifi-
cantly related to respondents' expectations of con-
tinuing full-time work after age 62. These results are
similar to findings on actual retirement. Of particular
importance are continued coverage in health plans,
expected changes in pension wealth, and current
health status. Although larger samples provide more
precise estimates for whites, findings on African
Americans and Hispanics indicate that information
on their retirement expectations, which differ in
some important respects from those of whites, can
increase our understanding of their future retire-
ment behavior. Differences in expectations among
white men and women, which are consistent with
gender differences observed in the retirement deci-
sions of whites, are also found.
In the next section of the article, I discuss the
evidence to date on the validity of retirement expec-
tations. In sections three and four, I develop a simple
model of retirement expectations, discuss the data,
and specify the retirement expectations function. In
section five, I discuss the empirical results, and in the
final section I draw some conclusions from these
findings.
Retirement Expectations
Although there is an extensive body of literature
on the usefulness of expectations data in other disci-
plines (Hendershot & Placek, 1981; Turner & Martin,
1984), there have been few studies that have exam-
ined the accuracy of expectations regarding eco-
nomic outcomes over relatively long time horizons.
With respect to retirement, a small number of stud-
ies have examined the correspondence between
workers' plans and their subsequent withdrawal
from the labor force (Anderson, Burkhauser, &
Quinn, 1996; Bernheim, 1988, 1989; Wolpin &
Gonul, 1985). Older workers in the Retirement His-
tory Study (Irelan, 1976) were found to make rela-
tively accurate forecasts regarding their age of retire-
ment and Social Security entitlements, conditional
on the information available to them at the time.
Furthermore, when realized retirement deviated
from expected retirement, the difference was correl-
ated with unforeseeable changes in circumstances,
such as legislated increases in Social Security bene-
fits, changes in health, or in local labor market condi-
tions. Respondents in the National Longitudinal Sur-
vey of Mature Men (Parnes, 1985) were also found to
predict their age of retirement with considerable
accuracy. Interestingly, the accuracy of expectations
was found to differ systematically by gender. Men in
the Retirement History Survey formed more accurate
expectations, that is, closer to realizations, regarding
the timing of retirement, whereas women were more
accurate about the value of future Social Security
benefits. Overall, respondents' forecasts of Social
Security benefits explained roughly 60% of the vari-
ance in realizations. Other studies examining survey
responses regarding the expected age of retirement
found that expected retirement age was explained by
a number of the same factors as realized retirement
age (Barfield & Morgan, 1969,1978; Hall & Johnson,
1980; Holtmann, Fronstin, Ullmann, & Longino,
1993; Shaw, 1984).
The expectations questions in the HRS are de-
signed to elicit probability distributions of future
retirement rather than an anticipated age of retire-
ment, as in previous surveys. Framed in this way, the
questions allow for direct tests of the consistency of
individual responses. Full-time workers are asked
the chances, on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is equal
to "absolutely no chance" and 10 implies "absolutely
certain," that they will be working full time after they
reach ages 62 and 65. Rescaled from 0 to 1, the
responses to these questions may be interpreted as
subjective probabilities.
These responses may not be useful, however, if
individuals have little idea of the probabilities of
future events or if they choose to answer randomly.
Examination of responses in the first wave of the HRS
to these questions and to similar questions regard-
ing life expectancy indicates that respondents on
average provide consistent and reasonable answers.
Hurd and McGarry (1994) find for the sample as a
whole that the subjective probabilities are internally
consistent, that is, they imply conditional probabili-
ties (probability of working after age 65, given the
probability of working after age 62) between zero
and one. They also find that the subjective probabili-
ties are externally consistent in that they correlate
with observed retirement probabilities and life ex-
pectancies. Moreover, simple cross-tabulations indi-
cate that the probabilities of working past ages 62 and
65 covary with several measures of health status and
with key features of employer pensions, two of the
important determinants of the age of retirement.
374 The Gerontologist
Figures 1 and 2 present the subjective probability
distributions of continuing full-time work past age
62 of married non-Hispanic white (thereafter,
"white"), non-Hispanic African American (thereaf-
ter, "black"), and Hispanic men and women. The
distributions represent conditional probabilities,
that is, the probability of working full time past 62
given that the person is currently working full time.
The means of these distributions for men for the
three groups are .51, .43, and .55, respectively, and
for women, .39, .31, and .39. The mean subjective
probabilities of full-time work past age 65 are less
than half these values for both genders. Thus, it
appears that relatively few married men and women
currently working full time expect to be engaged in
full-time work after 65. This sample response reflects
observed differences for these ages in population
labor force participation rates. Accordingly, this
study focuses on the decision to leave full-time work
after age 62 rather than after 65. The decision to leave
full-time work will be treated as synonymous with
the retirement decision; the issue of partial retire-
ment, in other words, will not be addressed. Among
full-time workers, less than 20% of women and 10%
of men expect to work a reduced number of hours
on their current job. Moreover, the mean age at
which respondents report that they expect to retire
(as distinct from leaving full-time work) is 63.2 for
men and 62.9 for women, which is consistent with
their reports of leaving full-time work.
The probability distributions in Figures 1 and 2
reveal a bunching at zero, 1.0, and .5 for both gen-
ders. This pattern suggests that many respondents
are certain that they will not work past age 62, many
others are certain that they will work past 62, and still
others are uncertain. That many respondents choose
either zero or 1.0 is not surprising because leaving
full-time work is to a large extent a matter of choice,
and many in this age group are likely to have already
decided whether or not to continue working after 62.
Those selecting .5 may not have made a decision or
may face greater uncertainty. There are also spikes at
.2 and .8 for both men and women and some mass at
each of the other values.
The distributions reveal some differences by gen-
der. Spikes at zero are higher for women than for
men, although this is true only among blacks and
Hispanics. In the white population, roughly equal
proportions of men and women express little confi-
dence that they will continue to work after 62. There
are also racial and ethnic differences reflected in
these distributions. Among men, the spike at zero is
highest for blacks and lowest for Hispanics; at 1.0,
the order is reversed. The spikes at .5, however, are
similar. In other words, the two populations differ
less in the proportions who feel uncertain about
their future work status than in the fractions who are
certain that they either will or will not work past 62.
The proportions of white men lie between those of
blacks and Hispanics at all three values. Among
women, roughly equal proportions of white women
choose values of zero and 1.0. Significantly higher
proportions of black and Hispanic women, however,

A Simple Model of Retirement Expectations
The fact that these subjective distributions differ
systematically by gender, race, and ethnicity in-
creases our confidence that the probabilistic expec-
tations questions used in the HRS can elicit nonran-
dom, considered responses. In light of this, and the
evidence found by Hurd and McGarry (1994) in the
full HRS sample, I assume that respondents' subjec-
tive probabilities of working past age 62 are valid
predictors of their objective probabilities of retire-
ment at this age, conditional on the information
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 375
available to them at the time of the HRS interview. I
then examine whether these retirement expectations
could have been generated by the same underlying
behavioral model that has been found to explain
observed retirement outcomes.
I assume that at some "planning" age before re-
tirement, older workers forecast their future earn-
ings, pension and Social Security entitlements, non-
labor income, and the value of their nonmarket time.
They then form expectations regarding the age at
which they will retire, which they may revise on
receipt of new information. Because the question in
the HRS asks about the likelihood of working after
reaching age 62, I assume that individuals forecast
the income available to them on reaching age 62
should they leave full-time work then, and the addi-
tional income they would receive if they work an-
other year. Income available to the individual on
becoming 62, which I call the base income, consists
of expected nonlabor income at that age plus the
expected value (discounted back to age 62) of the
future stream of Social Security and pension benefits
that will be received if he or she retires on becoming
62. The return from working an additional year is
equal to expected wage and nonwage compensa-
tion, plus the expected change in the discounted
value at 62 of Social Security and pension income due
to an additional year's earnings. Changes in the latter
may not necessarily be positive. Asset values of em-
ployer pensions may decline if benefits are struc-
tured to encourage retirement before age 62 (Fields
& Mitchell, 1984; Kotlikoff & Wise, 1985). Social Secu-
rity wealth may either remain constant from age 62 to
64 because benefits lost due to delayed retirement
are recouped later by means of an actuarially fair
adjustment (for those with average life expectan-
cies), or may increase if higher earnings result in
larger recomputed benefits (Burkhauser, 1980;
Reimers & Honig, 1993).
Theoretical considerations suggest that the larger a
person's expected base income at age 62, the lower
the likelihood that he or she will plan to continue
working after 62. The greater the expected net re-
ward from working another year, however, the
higher the expected income but the higher the price
of leaving work as well. If the latter effect dominates,
the individual will expect to continue working past
age 62. Plans for working past 62 are also predicted to
be influenced by the expected value of nonmarket
time at age 62. This may depend on a number of
factors: the individual's own health, his or her
spouse's health and labor force status, other family
responsibilities, and his or her tastes for individual or
joint nonmarket activities.
I examine the retirement expectations of married
men and women using the traditional family model
of labor supply (Killingsworth, 1983; Pozzebon &
Mitchell, 1989). Adapted to retirement expectations,
this model assumes that married women form expec-
tations regarding their own retirement conditional
on the retirement plans of their husbands. They in
effect treat their husbands' expected earnings as a
form of property income. Husbands, however, form
expectations independently of their wives' retire-
ment plans and expected earnings.
Data and Model Specification
The samples of 1,766 married men and 1,492 mar-
ried women used in this study are drawn from the
first wave of HRS interviews. These samples of re-
spondents between the ages of 46-61 who were full-
time wage and salary workers at the time of their
interview are divided into six subsamples of white,
black, and Hispanic married men and women. The
base age range of 51-61 years was selected for the
HRS to ensure that most respondents had not yet
retired at the first interview but were sufficiently
close to retirement age to have formed some expec-
tations regarding retirement. This sample design is
intended to provide information on the formation of
retirement expectations and the process by which
new information becomes incorporated into expec-
tations. For purposes of this study, spouses aged 46-
50 married to age-eligible respondents are added to
provide larger samples of the black and Hispanic
populations. The self-employed, those with unre-
ported wages, and multiple job-holders are excluded
from the samples. Full-time employment is defined
as 25 or more weekly hours to include those who may
be working less than the standard 35 hours but who
may nonetheless consider themselves full-time
workers and report their expectations of continuing
"full-time" on their current job.
As discussed earlier, the expectations that workers
form regarding the likelihood of continuing to work
full time past age 62 are assumed to depend on the
income they expect to receive on retirement at 62
(the base income), the additional income they expect
for working another year (the net reward to work),
and their anticipated tastes and preferences at age 62
for time spent outside of the market (the value of
nonmarket time). Expected base income at age 62 has
three components: expected nonwork-related in-
come, the expected discounted value of the future of
Social Security benefits, and the expected dis-
counted value of the future stream of benefits from
an employer pension. Expected nonearnings income
is measured by workers' current nonwork-related
income. For men, this consists of asset and dividend
income; for women, the latter plus husbands' earn-
ings, under the assumptions of the traditional family
model of labor supply. The expected discounted
value of the future stream of Social Security benefits
is measured by respondents' reports of the benefits
they expect to receive. Expected benefits from em-
ployer pensions are reported with considerably less
accuracy; thus, differences in the expected value of
defined benefit or defined contribution pensions are
represented by a dummy variable for whether work-
ers are covered by one or both of these types of
plans.
The net reward for an additional year of work past
age 62 is measured by (1) the individual's current
wage, as an estimate of earnings from another year of
full-time work after 62; (2) current coverage under
376 The Gerontologist
employer-provided health and disability insurance
plans, as an estimate of expected additional non-
wage compensation; and (3) the age at which the
worker is first eligible to receive employer pension
benefits, as an estimate of whether the worker's
pension wealth is likely to decline with an additional
year of work past 62. This latter measure is based on
evidence indicating that in many employer plans, the
discounted value of the pension begins to decline at
the age at which workers are eligible for "early"
benefits (Fields & Mitchell, 1984; Kotlikoff & Wise,
1985). Nearly all employer pension plans have provi-
sions for early receipt of benefits with actuarial re-
ductions of full benefits to cover the longer payout
period. Employers who wish to induce workers to
retire early may reduce benefits by less than the full
actuarial amount for retirement at this age. Past this
age, however, pension wealth may decline signifi-
cantly. Because many plans set the age of eligibility
for early benefits at 55, pension wealth may be de-
clining for many workers with continued work after
age 62.
The expected value of nonmarket time is mea-
sured by four variables: respondent's health,
spouse's health, spouse's labor force status, and
respondent's evaluation of the importance of spend-
ing time with his or her spouse in retirement. Some
measures of characteristics of the current job are also
included to capture variations in the disutility of
work or in occupational retirement norms. These
measures are whether the job involves repetitive
work or stress, whether it requires skill with people,
or whether it is in the public sector.
Estimation Results
Table 1 contains means and standard deviations of
the variables described earlier for each of the six
demographic samples. Maximum likelihood esti-
mates of the expected retirement functions of mar-
ried men appear in Table 2 and of married women in
Table 3. Although the subjective probability of con-
tinuing work after reaching age 62 takes on discrete
values from 0 to 1, this probability scale represents a
ranking rather than a continuous variable. The ordi-
nal values, however, are derived from a continuous
underlying response function in which each individ-
ual assigns a likelihood to working after 62 as a
function of a set of explanatory variables related to
his or her expected base income, net reward to work,
and value of nonmarket time. This response function
is a latent regression because the degree of confi-
dence that an individual feels about his or her em-
ployment after 62 is unobserved. What is observed is
the choice of a cell, from an ordered number of cells
from 0 to 1, closest to his or her estimation of the
chances of working past 62. The subjective probabil-
ity scale is thus an ordered categorical variable and, if
a normal distribution of the errors is assumed, is
appropriately estimated by an ordered probit model.
(The functions in Tables 2 and 3 were also estimated
by linear least squares. Findings were similar to those
using maximum likelihood estimation, although sig-
nificance levels of individual coefficients varied to
some degree between the two methods.)
The results shown in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that
expected retirement, as measured here by the sub-
jective probability of continuing to work full time
after age 62, is explained by the same factors that
influence actual retirement outcomes. Although
findings vary by demographic group, a number of
measures of the expected income at 62, the expected
reward for working another year, and the expected
value of nonmarket time are significant determinants
of the individual's assessment of his or her chances
of continuing to work after reaching 62. The gener-
ally higher significance levels in the larger samples of
white men and women suggest that although retire-
ment expectations may be fairly accurate indicators
of eventual retirement on average, there is consider-
able noise around the mean values. Nonetheless,
four of the six estimated functions in Tables 2 and 3
are significant at the .01 level, and a fifth, for black
women, is significant at the .05 level. Only the func-
tion for Hispanic men is below standard levels of
significance (.16). Differences in the functions of
whites, blacks, and Hispanics are significant at the
.01 level among both men and women. The maxi-
mum likelihood analog of a goodness-of-fit measure,
the likelihood ratio index, indicates that the included
variables explain a relatively small proportion of the
variation in the dependent variable, not unlike real-
ized retirement functions.
Among measures of the expected reward for an
additional year of work after reaching 62, continued
coverage in health plans and expected changes in
pension wealth have the most significant impact on
workers' expectations of continuing full-time work.
These results are consistent with findings on actual
retirement decisions. The availability of low-cost
health insurance on the job has long been postulated
as a major influence in delaying retirement but has
only recently been confirmed empirically (Rust &
Phelan, 1993). Recent evidence also indicates that
employees who are able to continue health insur-
ance coverage under employer plans after leaving
the job tend to retire earlier (Gruber & Madrian,
1993; Gustman & Steinmeier, 1993). Both of these
responses are reflected in the retirement expecta-
tions of white men and women in Tables 2 and 3.
Among those whose coverage terminates when they
leave the job, health insurance is strongly correlated
with expectations of continuing work past 62. Those
who report that they are able to continue coverage
under their employers' plans, on the other hand,
expect an earlier withdrawal. The effect of employer-
provided health insurance among the black and His-
panic populations is mixed. Black men whose cover-
age terminates with the job expect to leave their jobs
earlier, rather than later, than those not covered by
health insurance. Hispanic women whose coverage
terminates expect to remain longer on the job; the
coefficient is imprecisely measured, however. Re-
maining coefficients of health insurance variables are
not different from zero.

counted value of the employer pension increases
with an additional year of work has a statistically
significant impact on the expected continuation of
work past 62 of every demographic group except
black women. The change in pension wealth is mea-
sured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if the age at
which covered workers are first eligible for benefits
is greater than 62. Because in many employer pen-
sion plans the discounted value of the pension rises
until the age of eligibility for "early" benefits, and
falls thereafter, a value of 1 indicates that pension
wealth is likely to increase with an additional year of
work after 62. (For workers with capital market con-
straints, who would have preferred to retire earlier,
this variable may also reflect the effect of the first
availability of pension benefits on expected retire-
ment.) In all groups except black women, those
whose pension wealth increases with additional
work expect to continue working past 62. These
effects are significant at the .05 level or above.
A second dummy variable is equal to 1 if respon-
dents know the age at which they are first eligible for
benefits. Given inclusion of the variable for eligibility
after age 62, the coefficient of this control variable
measures, among those who are eligible for early
benefits before age 62, the effect of a decline in

pension wealth with additional work on the likeli-
hood of continued work after 62. In all six groups,
workers Whose pension values begin to decline be-
fore age 62 have lower probabilities of continuing on
their jobs past 62, although the coefficients are pre-
cisely estimated only for black and Hispanic women.
A third control variable has a value of 1 if the worker
is covered by an employer pension. Given the two
previous variables, the coefficient of this coverage
variable measures the effect of being covered by an
employer pension among those who do not know
their age of eligibility for early benefits. This variable
is significant only for white men, who report a lower
likelihood of working past 62.
This finding of the importance of employer pen-
sions in expectations is consistent with the critical
role they have been found to play in realized retire-
ment. Among women, in fact, the results here sug-
gest that pensions may play an even more important
role in the future than they have previously. Esti-
mates on samples from the Retirement History Sur-
vey of married men and unmarried women who
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 379
retired in the 1970s found that the effects of em-
ployer pensions were weaker among women than
men (Hanoch & Honig, 1983; Reimers & Honig,
1996). This difference is not apparent in these find-
ings on the expectations of current preretirement
men and women.
A third component of the net reward for an addi-
tional year of work, coverage under employer-
provided disability plans, has a positive and statisti-
cally significant effect on the expectations of
full-time employment after 62 among white and
black women. (The fact that coverage for chronic,
long-term heath problems is more important for
black women than coverage under general health
insurance may indicate greater incidence of these
problems in this population or may be related to
industry or occupational risk differentials not cap-
tured in the included job-characteristics variables.)
Among Hispanic women and men, the effect is also
positive but imprecisely measured. Among white
men, employer-provided disability insurance is asso-
ciated with earlier rather than later retirement from
the job. This counterintuitive result, similar to the
findings on the effect of health insurance among
black men, merits further examination. It is possible,
for example, that both results reflect aspects of jobs
that are not measured by the included job-
characteristics variables. The final measure of the
reward for an additional year of full-time work is the
hourly wage on the current job. Coefficients of the
natural logarithm of the wage are mostly negative
and not statistically significant (with the exception of
that of white men), suggesting that the negative
effects on additional work of a higher income are
offset by the higher price of leaving work.
We now turn to measures of the expected base
income at age 62, which is predicted to have a nega-
tive effect on the expectations of working past 62.
Coverage under an employer pension plan in itself,
as a measure of expectations regarding a pension of
which neither age of eligibility nor amount of poten-
tial benefit is known, has the predicted negative
effect among white men only. Coverage under Social
Security in itself (among those who say that they do
not know what their future benefits will be) influ-
ences expectations only among Hispanics and, inter-
estingly, is associated with a greater likelihood of
continuing work past 62. Because the majority of
Hispanic men and women in this sample of full-time
workers are immigrants, it is possible that many may
wish to increase potential Social Security benefits by
accumulating additional years of higher earnings.
This explanation is consistent with the lower ex-
pected benefits of Hispanics relative to blacks and
whites (Table 1).
Self-reported expected Social Security benefits are
not a significant determinant of plans for continued
work among any of the demographic groups. With-
out Social Security earnings records, it is impossible
to determine the extent to which this finding reflects
reporting error or the true unimportance of varia-
tions in Social Security benefits. The majority of
studies that have examined the effect of Social Secu-
rity on retirement outcomes have found significant,
although often small effects (see the summary of this
research in Quinn, Burkhauser, & Myers, 1990). Re-
spondents who know the value of their future bene-
fits tend to have a lower probability of continuing
work past 62 than those who expect to receive bene-
fits but are unable to report an expected amount, but
this effect is significant among white men only. (This
result for white men is consistent with findings that
the strongest predictor of actual retirement age
among white men is whether they are aware of the
value of their potential Social Security benefits,
Reimers, 1977).
The final measure of expected base income is
nonwork-related income. This variable includes, for
men, interest and dividends, rental income, and in-
come from trusts; for women, it also includes hus-
bands' earnings. The variable has the predicted neg-
ative sign and is highly significant for white men and
just under standard levels of significance for white
women (probability value = .15). It is not significant
for blacks or Hispanics of either gender. (Dummy
variables for whether positive values of property
income and spouse's earnings were reported were
included in the estimations but are not reported.)
Finally, factors affecting the expected value of non-
market time or the disutility of work at age 62 should
influence expectations regarding continuing full-
time work after that age, if the behavioral model
underlying expectations is the same as that generat-
ing actual retirement outcomes. The HRS provides a
number of alternative measures of the value of non-
market time, and in the absence of strong theoretical
predictions regarding these alternatives, several
were tested to determine their explanatory power.
With the exception of the worker's own health,
which is one of the most important influences on
realized retirement and therefore of special interest
for its role in expectations, only variables that were
significant (or close to significance) were retained in
the estimations. As Tables 2 and 3 indicate, there was
considerable variation in the importance of each
factor among the six groups.
Among men, health status as measured by a self-
reported index of overall health condition is one of
the most important factors influencing expectations
of continued work. Among women workers, how-
ever, health is important only among Hispanic
women. This gender difference is not surprising be-
cause it is consistent with findings in the retirement
literature that have concluded that, unlike married
men, married women in poor health tend to with-
draw early from the labor force (or do not enter it) so
that health condition is not observed to influence the
retirement decisions of workers. These findings refer
to the white population and the implication that,
among white workers, men's health should be worse
on average than that of women is borne out in our
samples (Table 1). The self-reported health of black
men and women in the sample is similar, however,
raising the question of why health is not as important
a consideration for black women as it is for black
men. Among Hispanic workers, the health status of
380 The Gerontologist
women is worse than that of men. Thus, it is perhaps
not surprising that health is an important factor in the
retirement plans of Hispanic women.
Three additional measures of the value of nonmar-
ket time are important factors for at least one demo-
graphic group. Spouse's health is significant for
white men and women, and the positive sign for both
genders indicates that although poor health of a
spouse may raise the value of nonmarket time, it has
a larger effect on the income needs of the house-
hold; thus, both men and women expect to continue
working past 62. White men and black women expect
to continue working if their spouses are currently
working (a proxy for spouse's expected employment
status when the respondent is 62), although the coef-
ficient is not precisely estimated for black women.
These results imply preferences for joint leisure in
these groups.
The HRS also provides a direct measure of the
importance that a married person places on being
able to spend more time with a spouse in retirement.
Respondents were asked to rank, on a scale from 1
("very important") to 4 ("not important at all"), a
number of characteristics generally considered to be
positive about retirement, including having more
time with one's spouse. This measure captures not
only the value of home production arising from
household needs related to the health or age of the
spouse, but also the value placed on joint leisure
activities. Interestingly, the coefficients of this vari-
able are insignificant for men, but positive and highly
significant for two of the three groups of women.
Both white and Hispanic women who place a higher
value on time with their husbands in retirement have
a lower expected probability of continuing full-time
work past 62.
A number of characteristics of jobs that may influ-
ence the disutility of work are found to be important
factors in men's decisions regarding continued work
but relatively unimportant for women. Jobs involving
repetitive tasks or stress are associated with lower
expectations of continuing to work past 62 for white
and Hispanic men; jobs requiring skill with people
are associated with higher expectations of working
among white men, but lower expectations among
black men. For both white and black men, jobs in the
public sector are associated with lower expectations
of continuing work. Among women, reduced expec-
tations of continuing work are associated with,
among Hispanic women, jobs involving repetitive
tasks and, among black women, jobs involving
stress.
Conclusion
These findings on data from the Health and Retire-
ment Study suggest that information on retirement
expectations will enhance our understanding of re-
tirement behavior and our ability to forecast re-
sponses to changes in public policy regarding retire-
ment. Expected retirement functions, estimated
separately for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
African-American, and Hispanic men and women,
appear to have been generated by the same underly-
ing behavioral model that has been found to explain
retirement outcomes. To varying degrees among the
six demographic groups, measures of expected re-
tirement income, the net reward to continued work,
and the value of nonmarket time influence workers'
expectations of continuing work after age 62. Al-
though results are strongest for white men and
women, for whom large samples provide more pre-
cise estimation, findings on all three populations in-
crease our confidence that information on retirement
expectations may improve our estimates of current
behavior and our forecasts of future behavior.
