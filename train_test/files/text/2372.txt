Emergency Department Visits Resulting From
Intentional Injury In and Out of School
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Injuries sustained by children
in the school setting have a significant public health impact.
A concerning subgroup of school injuries are due to intentional
and violent etiologies. Several studies have identified a need for
further research to understand intentional school-based injuries.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study discusses national estimates
and trends over time and risk factors of intentional injury­related
emergency department visits due to injuries sustained in the
school setting.
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have reported con-
cerning numbers of injuries to children in the school setting. The objec-
tive was to understand temporal and demographic trends in intentional
injuries in the school setting and to compare these with intentional inju-
ries outside the school setting.
METHODS: Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System­
All Injury Program from 2001 to 2008 were analyzed to assess emergency
department visits (EDVs) after an intentional injury.
RESULTS: There were an estimated 7 397 301 total EDVs due to injuries
sustained at school from 2001 to 2008. Of these, an estimated 736 014
(10%) were reported as intentional (range: 8.5%­10.7% for the study
time period). The overall risk of an EDV after an intentional injury in
school was 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.93­2.82) when com-
pared with an EDV after an intentional injury outside the school
setting. For intentional injury­related EDVs originating in the school
setting, multivariate regression identified several demographic risk
factors: 10- to 14-year-old (odds ratio [OR]: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.10­2.27) and
15- to 19-year-old (OR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.01­2.82) age group, black (OR:
4.14; 95% CI: 2.94­5.83) and American Indian (OR: 2.48; 95% CI: 2.06­
2.99) race, and Hispanic ethnicity (OR: 3.67; 95% CI: 2.02­6.69). The
odds of hospitalization resulting from intentional injury­related EDV
compared with unintentional injury­related EDVs was 2.01 (95% CI:
1.50­2.69) in the school setting. These odds were found to be 5.85
(95% CI: 4.76­7.19) in the outside school setting.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest a need for additional
prevention strategies addressing school-based intentional injuries.

American children spend 180 days
each year at school, making it the most
common place other than their home
where they spend time.1­3 Conse-
quently, it is perhaps unsurprising that
they sustain an estimated 10% to 25%
of all injuries in the school setting.1,4,5
Whereas most injuries in this setting
are documented to be the result of
unintentional mechanisms, including
sports or other physical activity,4­13
a concerning subgroup of school inju-
ries are due to intentional and violent
etiologies, with 10% to 17% of school
injuries resulting from intentional
mechanisms.4­6 Additionally, results
from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveil-
lance System for 2011 indicate that
20.1% of youth nationwide reported
being bullied on school property.14
A number of studies have shown sig-
nificant health-related issues, including
anincreaseinrisk-takingbehaviors,poor
school performance, and absenteeism
related to bullying and violence.15­23 As
a consequence, there have been nu-
merous efforts to reduce injuries in the
school setting, including increased su-
pervision of physical activities, im-
proving student:teacher ratio, teaching
students how to deescalate bullying,
adding safety officers, teaching school
staff how to address violence, and extra
activities for students such as music
and arts classes to avoid unstructured
or unsupervised time in school.2,10,22,24
Pediatricintentionalandunintentional
injuries have been thoroughly discussed
in the literature,20,25­30 and several stud-
ies have identified a need for further
research to understand intentional
school-based injuries.1­7,10,24,25,31­33 With
the increasing awareness of physical
and mental health issues associated
with intentional injuries resulting from
interpersonal violence and bullying in
children, it is important to examine the
overall trend for such injuries in the
school setting to tailor appropriate mea-
sures for safety and prevention.1,6,24,31,32
Therefore, the goal of this study was to
examine the national demographic and
temporal trends of intentional injuries in
the school setting. Our specific objective
was to compare emergency department
visits (EDVs) for intentional injuries sus-
tained in the school setting to EDVs
resulting from intentional injuries sus-
tained outside of the school setting to
better guide preventive efforts.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a retrospective cohort study
using data from the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)­All
Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) from January
1, 2001, through December 31, 2008.
The study was classified as exempt by
the Rhode Island Hospital Committee
on the Protection of Human Subjects.
Study Setting and Population
Data from NEISS-AIP were obtained at
www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/
series/00198. NEISS-AIP is a database
of EDVs for injury reported by 66 hos-
pitals (of the 100 NEISS database hos-
pitals) selected from throughout the
United States. Sampling is performed
to derive a stratified probability sam-
ple of the 5000 hospitals in the United
States with emergency departments
(EDs) that have at least 6 beds and are
operational 24 hours per day. A sam-
pling weight is assigned to each case
on the basis of the inverse probability
of selection to provide national esti-
mates. NEISS-AIP is operated by the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission
in collaboration with the National
Center for Injury Prevention and
Control, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.34 A NEISS-trained re-
searcher at each institution is respon-
sible for reviewing the chart and
entering data related to each injury
visit, including the patient's age,
gender, race, and ethnicity; the date of
the injury; the location where the injury
occurred in the community; the body
part to which the injury occurred; the
intent and perpetrator (if intentional);
the patient's diagnosis and disposition;
and a detailed account of the injury
event as gleaned from the medical
records. Trained quality assurance
coders at the NEISS center code from
the narrative and provide the "cause of
injury." Data values with ,20 records,
with weighted estimates ,1200, or
with a coefficient of variation .30%
are considered by NEISS to be unstable
and were interpreted accordingly when
making decisions about variable recod-
ing and regression modeling.
Measurements
Our study examined nonfatal injury-
related EDVs from January 2001
through December 2008. The injury-
related EDV rate was calculated by
using the average census for the age
groupfromtheUScensusdataover the
study time period (http://www.census.
gov/popest/data/historical/2000s/vin-
tage_2008/). Intent of injury is recor-
ded as "intentional" or "unintentional/
unknown" in the data set and was
used as such for this study. NEISS-AIP
defines intentional injuries as "an in-
jury [that] was caused by an act car-
ried out on purpose by oneself or by
another person(s), with the goal of
injuring or killing".35 Unintentional
injuries were defined as those due
to "not deliberate means." Because
NEISS data are not intended to capture
all deaths related to injuries, EDVs
associated with fatality or "dead
on arrival" were excluded from our
analysis.
The location of injury was identified as
"school setting" when documented as
"school," whereas injuries that oc-
curred in any location other than
school were coded as "outside school
setting." Those EDVs where the location
was unknown were excluded from the
analysis. Visits by patients between the

PEDIATRICS Volume 133, Number 2, February 2014 255
ages of 5 and 19 years were included in
the analysis. Age was categorized into 3
groups: 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and
15 to 19 years, which approximate the
traditional elementary, middle, and
high school age groups, respectively.
NEISS coding for race and ethnicity
defines "white" as non-Hispanic, "black"
as both non-Hispanic and Hispanic
black, and "Hispanic" as "Hispanics for
all races other than black." Although it
is noted by NEISS-AIP that 17% of the
race/ethnicity data are missing for the
overall data set, these data were found
to be missing for 7% for our study
sample.
Diagnosis at discharge was restricted
to the top 5 categories and "other." We
created a "traumatic brain injury"
category for the diagnoses of con-
cussion and fracture or internal in-
jury when "head" was the injured
body part.5,36 All other diagnoses
were left as originally coded in the
NEISS-AIP database. Immediate cause
of injury was also restricted to the
top 5 causes and "other." Disposition
was recoded as follows: "discharged"
(those patients who were "treated and
released"), "hospitalized/transferred/
observed" (those patients who were
"treated and transferred", "hospital-
ized," or "held for observation"), and
"other" (those patients who "left with-
out being seen/left against medical ad-
vice," or whose disposition was not
specified or was "unknown").
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed with SAS (version
9.3; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) by using
the SURVEYFREQ and SURVEYLOGISTIC
procedures. A specific weighting factor
was assigned to each NEISS hospital re-
lated to the inverse probability of selec-
tion,permittinggeneralizationofthedata
tothenationalpopulation.Theprobability
value for statistical significance was set
at an a level of 0.05. National estimates,
frequencies, and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of
the sample weights and clusters. Tests
for trend for intentional injuries over
time were performed by using PROC
SURVEYLOGISTIC with treatment year
scored as a linear sequence. Separate
multivariable logistic regression models
were fittothe in-school and out-of-school
data to model the probability of an in-
tentional injury­related EDV, adjusted for
gender, age, race, and ethnicity.
RESULTS
During the study time period (2001­
2008), NEISS-AIP data identified an esti-
mated 44 721 462 injury-related EDVs for
youth 5 to 19 years of age where the lo-
cation of injury was known. Of these, an
estimated 7 397 301 (12.5%) injuries oc-
curred in the school setting (an average
of 924 662 EDVs per year). This finding
represents an annualized injury-related
EDV rate of 45 per 1000 children in the
school setting, based on the average
2001­2008 US census (census mean =
20 480 716 for 5­19 years of age).
There were a total of 736 014 (average =
92 001 per year) intentional injury­
related EDVs from the school setting,
with an annual rate of 4.5 per 1000 chil-
dren. For the "outside school" setting,
the total number of intentional injury­
related EDVs was 2 293 922 from 2001 to
2008 (average = 286 740 per year), with
an annual rate of 14 per 1000 children.
For the unintentional injuries, the annual
rate of EDVs was found to be 41 per 1000
children in the school setting (average =
832 660 per year) and 214 per 1000 chil-
dren in the "outside school" setting (av-
erage = 4 378 770 per year) for the study
time period. The proportion of EDVs due
to intentional injury at school varied over
time, from 10.7% of all injuries in 2001­
2002 to 8.5% of all injuries in 2007­2008
(Table 1, Fig 1). A test for trend revealed
a decreasing trend for intentional inju-
ries inside school (Ptrend
= .046) but not
for outside school (Ptrend
= .462).
The demographic characteristics for
patientswith intentional injury­related
EDVs from both in-school and out-of-
the-school settings are summarized
in Table 2. The odds foran EDV due to an
intentional injury (with reference to
unintentional injury) in the school set-
ting compared with outside the school
setting were found to be 1.76 (95% CI:
1.45­2.12) in the univariate logistic
models. Male gender and the 10- to
14-year age group were identified
as risk factors for intentional injury­
related EDVs in the school setting and
female gender and the 15- to 19-year
age group were identified as risk

factors for intentional injury­related
EDVs in the outside school setting (Ta-
ble 3). Patients of black and American
Indian race and of Hispanic ethnicity
were also found to have higher risk of
intentional injury­related EDVs in both
settings when compared with un-
intentional injuries (Table 3).
For intentional injury­related EDVs
from the school setting (Table 4), vari-
ous demographic risk factors were
identified as follows: 10- to 14-year and
15- to 19-year age groups, black and
American Indian race, and Hispanic
ethnicity (odds ratio [OR]: 3.67; 95%
CI: 2.02­6.69). When contrasting the 2
settings (Table 4), girls were less likely
to have an intentional injury­related
EDV compared with boys in the school
setting but were more likely than boys
to have an intentional injury­related
EDV in the outside-school setting. The
risk of an intentional injury­related
EDV was found to be lower for the 15- to
19-year age group in the school setting
when compared with the outside
school setting. Black race and Hispanic
ethnicity were both found to confer
higher risks for the school setting when
compared with the outside-school set-
ting (Table 4).
AdescriptionoftheEDVsispresentedin
Table 5 for the 2 settings. Fractures
were identified more often in the school
setting, whereas lacerations were
identified more often in the outside-
school setting. The proportion of inju-
ries due to traumatic brain injury was
higher in the school setting compared
with the outside-school setting. Poi-
soning was identified as 1 of the top 5
diagnoses for the outside-school set-
ting. Conversely, strain/sprain was
common in the school setting but
comparatively not as common outside
of school. The proportion of EDVs due to
assault as an immediate cause was
higher in the school setting, and those
due to self (intentional self-harm) or
legal intervention were more common
in the outside-school setting.
With regard to disposition, the overall
risk of hospitalization (hospitalized/
transferred/observed) in all settings was
4.91 (95% CI: 4.03­5.97) for any in-
tentional injury­related EDV compared
with an unintentional injury­related
EDV. The likelihood of hospitalization
after an intentional injury­related
EDV (versus an unintentional injury­
related EDV) was lower for the school
setting (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.50­2.69)
when compared with outside the school
setting (OR: 5.85; 95% CI: 4.76­7.19)
(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Despite increased emphasis on safety
at school and evidence of a decreasing
trend, children aged 5 to 19 years still
experienced a substantial number of
intentional injuries at school over the
time period studied. A recent study
has also noted that ED utilization by
pediatric patients due to violence (not
limited to a specific setting) has not

over time revealed a decreasing trend for intentional injuries inside the school (Ptrend
= .046) but not
for outside of the school (Ptrend

changed.29 Additionally, our study has
shown that the proportion of injury
visits originating from school that are
intentional continues to be higher
than for those suffered out of the
school setting, suggesting the need for
additional interventions to enhance
safety at school.
This study identified a gender disparity
in intentional injury­related EDVs for
the 2 settings, with boys more likely to
have intentional injury­related EDVs
when originating in the school setting
and girls more likely in the outside-
school setting. This gender difference
is interesting, especially because pre-
vious studies have identified male
gender to be a risk factor for injuries in
a variety of settings.6,11,12,14,21,26 Further
research is needed to understand why
this disparity exists.
Another important finding from this
study is that middle school­aged chil-
dren (10- to 14-year-old group) carry
a significant burden of intentional
injury­related EDVs in the school set-
ting. This is in contrast to the out-of-
school setting where high school­aged
students (15- to 19-year-old group) were
found to have the highest burden. This
distribution persisted through the
study time period and was consistent
with our earlier study.5
Previous studies have documented that
African American race and Hispanic
ethnicity are associated with increased
likelihood of bullying and its associated
mentalandphysicalhealthimpacts.18,19,21
Our study also suggests that racial dis-
parity persists for the risk of intentional
injury­related EDVs. In addition to stu-
dents of black race and Hispanic eth-
nicity, American Indian youth were found
to be high risk. Interestingly, these de-
mographic risks are much higher in the
school settingcomparedwiththeoutside-
school setting. This finding suggests the
need for developing interventions that
meet the needs of these populations.
Of note, there is no information in
NEISS-AIP regarding the racial and
ethnic background of perpetrators or
of the overall racial/ethnic composition
of the school where an injury occurred,
thus limiting understanding of the ra-
cial disparity phenomenon.

When considering the types of injuries
sustained due to intentional mecha-
nisms, it is important to note that the
risk of sustaining traumatic brain
injuries was similar to that of sus-
tainingabrasions/contusions.Thehead
and neck region was also found to be
the most common body region affected,
followed by the upper extremities. This
finding is in contrast to earlier studies
that documented upper extremity to be
the most frequently affected body part
in all school injuries.4,7 Possibly related
to this phenomenon, most of the in-
tentional injuries in our study sample
were reported to be to the result of
assault, and 90% reported the per-
petrator to be either a friend or an
acquaintance in the school setting.
Other studies have shown that a bul-
lied victim frequently knew the bully
and that the incident usually involved
a past disagreement.28 When consid-
ering the perpetrators, it is notable
that 10% of the EDVs were reportedly
due to multiple perpetrators in the
school setting. Intentional injuries and
violence have immense mental health
effects on the victims, and studies have
reported that victims may be involved
with future violence, either as victims
or as perpetrators.21,22 With the knowl-
edge that intentional injuries continue
to be a significant problem in the school
setting, and in light of the limited in-
formation that these data offer re-
garding perpetrators, it is clear that
more work needs to be done to un-
derstand the victim-bully relationship to
design preventive efforts.
The risk of hospitalization in our study
was found to be higher for intentional
versus unintentional injury­related
EDVs in either setting. If being hospi-
talized is a proxy for sustaining a seri-
ous injury, these data document that
children sustained more serious inju-
ries resulting in hospitalization when
the injury was intentionally inflicted
compared with unintentional injuries.
This finding further emphasizes the
importance of the problem and need
for preventive efforts.
This study was limited in terms of its
ability to completely capture the full
range of injuries suffered by children,
both in and out of the school environ-
ment. Because the NEISS-AIP data
source is predicated on the injury
resulting in an EDV, it does not include
patients who were directly admitted to
a hospital. This limitation also points
toward the inherent selection bias de-
pendent on the sampling design and
a caregiver's decision to seek medical
care in the ED. For example, studies
have shown that there may be over-
referral to the ED from school after an
injury.9 Additionally, care may have
been sought at a primary care office,
urgent care center, or other medical
provider, and those visits would not
have been captured here. Another
limitation is the data's wide CIs that

result from national estimates that
are based on a restricted sample of
66 hospitals. It is also important to note
that NEISS data do not code for the
acuity of a visit and do not report data
on fatalities in the school setting, which
may limit understanding of the most
serious injuries.
Although the NEISS-AIP database col-
lects information on a wide range of
patients, it lacks the granularity that
would be necessary to more fully an-
swer questions one might have about
an individual injury. This, in turn,
makes it difficult to ascertain the
specific circumstances under which
each of the injuries occurred. A
plethora of characteristics related to
the school environment, including the
physical environment and location of
a school, supervision provided while in
the school environment, demographic
characteristics of perpetrators, and
many others, all may have an effect on
the occurrence of an individual in-
tentional injury. Precise detail about
the intentional injury event can assist
in developing preventive strategies
especially related to using the princi-
ples of the Haddon Matrix.37
CONCLUSIONS
There are substantial numbers of in-
tentional injury­related EDVs from
the school setting. Our study identi-
fies age, gender, and racial and ethnic
disparities associated with school-
based intentional injuries, empha-
sizing the need for the development
of culturally appropriate preventive
strategies.

FANTASY FOOTBALL: I was recently emailing with one of my advisees when she
confessed that she was feeling stressed. As she is a fourth year medical student
preparing to interview for a highly competitive residency position, I offered some
words of wisdom on the application process and the strength of her application.
She responded that her stress was not because of her upcoming interviews but
because it was draft night for her fantasy football league.
Fantasy football is a game in which fans create imaginary teams selected from
players in the National Football League. Fans score points and compete against
each other based on the statistical performance of their selected players. This
creates intense interest in games across the nation. It turns out that fantasy
football is incredibly popular ­ so popular that even football stadiums have to
account for a fan's desire to keep track of his or her players.
As reported in The New York Times (Sports: September 14, 2013), the days when
fans could only see their local football team play by attending a game in person
are long gone. With high-definition TV, high-speed internet connections, and round
the clock programming, fans can see almost any game any time and track how
well their local and fantasy teams are doing from the comfort of home. Recog-
nizing the popularity of fantasy football, stadiums are now being outfitted with
lounges packed with TV screens showing all the games being played, high-speed
internet connections, comfortable chairs, air conditioning, and easy access to
food and drink. Fans dispirited by the play of the home team can wander into the
lounge and root for their fantasy football players. Lounges in some stadiums are
so popular that bouncers are employed to control access and crowding.
While it seems a bit odd to purchase a ticket essentially to spend the afternoon in
asports bar,theteams are tryingtobattleflaggingattendanceand createagreat
game-day experience. As for my advisee, she does not attend the games in person,
preferring to keep track of the New England Patriots and her fantasy team by
smartphone. And, she told me that she had a very successful draft.
