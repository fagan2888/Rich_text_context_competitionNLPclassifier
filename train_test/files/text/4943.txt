Introduction
Lipid imbalance has long been considered as the causative
factor for the development of coronary artery disease
(CAD).1 Lipid deposition in the vascular wall, the funda-
mental mechanism of CAD starts from infancy and pro-
gresses with age.2 Atherosclerosis is the disorder of
hyperlipidaemia, increased intracellular generation of lipid
peroxidation, vascular intima media lipid deposition and
cytokine imbalance.3 Atherosclerosis is considered as an
underlying phenomenon of CAD. Age, sex, genetic predis-
position are non-modifiable risk factors for CAD, while
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle,
smoking and dyslipidaemia are modifiable risk factors.4
Angiotensin II is a biologically active product of the
renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system (RAAS);5 it is a
potent vasoconstrictor and regulates cerebral blood flow.
The RAAS has been recognised as the principal therapeu-
tic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.6
Ferrario in 20067 found that kinase II peptide has an identi-
cal structure to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor. Kinase II peptide was found to degrade brady-
kinin, lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients and

Abstract
Introduction: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lycopene on renal tissue antioxidant enzymes and angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression and serum activity in diet-induced hyperlipidaemia.
Methods: Thirty-two female Wistar albino rats (200­250 g weight), 5­6 months of age, were randomly selected and
divided into four groups. Group I received normal diet; group II received 24 g high fat diet/100 g of daily diet; group
III received 24 g high fat diet/100 g daily diet and 200 ml of lycopene extract (twice a week) for 8 weeks; and group IV
received 200 ml oral lycopene extract twice a week for 8 weeks.
Results: A marked increase was observed in plasma urea and creatinine levels, serum C-reactive protein, kidney
weight, tissue renal malonyldialdehyde level, ACE gene expression and serum level, while a decrease catalase level
among hyperlipidaemic rats was observed. Histologically, interstitial inflammation and proliferation was seen. Lycopene
supplementation significantly decreased plasma urea and creatinine, serum ACE, renal tissue malonyldialdehyde level and
C-reactive protein level, while it increased tissue antioxidant enzymes level and total protein. Tissue inflammation and
proliferation was improved.
Conclusions: This finding suggests that supplementation of lycopene is effective for renal antioxidant enzymes, ACE
gene expression and ACE serum level in hyperlipidaemic rats.

beneficially modulate haemodynamics in patients with
heart failure. Since then many ACE inhibitors have been
studied for antihypertensive/cardiomodulatory therapies.7
Pharmacological therapies have been used to treat
hyperlipidaemia but exert side effects. Therefore, the
choice of non-pharmacological therapies including diet
plays an important role in alleviating the major cause of
death all over the world including cardiac heart disease,
stroke, cancer, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis.8
Plants have a long history of medicinal usage to treat body
ailments. Antioxidants, flavonoids, polyphenols of food
have been studied to treat life-threatening diseases.
Lycopene is a most powerful antioxidant, which is natu-
rally present in carrots, tomatoes, watermelons, papaya,
cherries, strawberries, beans etc.9 Previous investigations
reflect the cardioprotective,10 antineoplastic11 and nephro-
protective effects of lycopene in diabetes.12 Therefore, the
purpose of the present study is to investigate the role of
lycopene on the modulation of renal antioxidant enzymes,
serum ACE and ACE gene expression in diet-induced
hyperlipidaemia using an experimental rat model.
Materials and methods
Animals and diet
Thirty-two female albino Wistar rats (200­260 g body-
weight) were purchased from the animal house of the
International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences,
Karachi, Pakistan, for the study. Animals were kept in the
laboratory for one week before the start of the experiment
and were caged in a temperature controlled room (23±4°C).
Drinking water, standard rat diet and high fat diet (HFD)
for the experiment were easily available to the rats. The
experiments were followed in accordance with the ethical
guidelines of internationally accepted principles for labo-
ratory use and care in animal research (Health Research
Extension Act of 1985).13
Preparation of HFD
A HFD was prepared according to the method of Khalifa
et al.,14 30 g of casein, 7 g wheat flour, 4 g bran, 10 g glu-
cose, 6 g common salt, 3% vitamin mixture and 40 g raw
melted beef fat separately. All ingredients were then mixed
with water and 12 g pellets were prepared. Almost 50.4%
of the daily ingested calories through this diet were derived
from its fat content.
Preparation of lycopene extract
The lycopene extract was prepared according to the
method of Lavecchia and Zuorro.15 Fresh tomatoes were
washed with tap water and an X cut was made at the small
end, they were then immersed in boiling water for about
1­2 minutes to remove the skin, and dried in an oven at
200°C to remove moisture. About 250 mg of dehydrated
peel was mixed with 3 ml of butylated hydroxytoluene in
acetone (0.5% w/v), 3 ml of ethanol, 6 ml of hexane and
incubated in a 25°C water bath with continuous stirring.
After 2 hours, 2.5 ml of aqueous enzyme solution (pecti-
nase 2% v/v in glycine buffer pH 10) was added and the
mixture was then left for 20 hours; 7.5 ml of hexane was
then added with continuous stirring and allowed to stand
for a further 4 hours, so that the organic and aqueous phase
was separated and the upper most reddish coloured hexane
layer was extracted as lycopene. Spectrophotometrically
the lycopene concentration was determined as 503 nm
with absorbent coefficient 3120 for hexane as blank. The
lycopene concentration obtained per litre was 0.437 mg.
Study design
Thirty-two albino wistar rats of female sex (200­250 g
bodyweight) were randomly divided into four groups.
Each group consisted of eight rats (n=8).
Group I: Control group (negative controls) received
normal rat diet.
Group II: Hyperlipidaemic positive controls received
24 g of HFD/100 g of daily diet for 8 weeks. Animals
were weighed before HFD and then every 7 days.
Group III: Hyperlipidaemic plus lycopene-treated
group received 24 g HFD/100 g of daily diet plus 200
ml oral lycopene extract (twice a week) for 8 weeks.
Group IV: Lycopene-treated group received 200 ml of
lycopene extract (87.4 µg of lycopene) orally twice a
week for 8 weeks.
Sample collection
After 12 hours of fasting, the rats were dissected under
anaesthesia. A 5 ml heparin-coated syringe with 25­30
gauge size needle was inserted from behind the xiphoid
cartilage into the heart, making an angle of 10­30°C from
the breast bone. About 10­20 ml of blood was collected
through this procedure. The plasma was obtained by col-
lecting blood in heparin-coated glass tubes and centrifug-
ing at 3000×g for 5 minutes and storing at -80°C for
biochemical analysis.
The serum was obtained by collecting the blood in
clean glass tubes and allowing it to stand for 1­2 hours
undisturbed. It was then centrifuged at 3000 rmp for 5
minutes and stored supernatant at -80°C for biochemical
analysis.
After dissection, the kidneys were removed from the
animals, washed with ice cold saline (0.9% NaCl), adher-
ent fat and connective tissues were removed and kidneys
were blot dried over the filter paper. Both kidneys were
Khan et al. 3
weighed and one was stored at -80°C for preparing
homogenate, while the other kidney was used for histo-
pathological study. The kidney was immersed in 10% for-
malin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at
3 µm, stained with haematoxylin and eosin and evaluated
by light microscopy.16
For homogenate preparation: Kidney tissues at a ratio
of 1:10 (w/v) were mixed with 100 mM potassium chlo-
ride buffer of pH 7.0 and homogenised, then centrifuged
at 600×g for 60 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was sepa-
rated and stored at -70°C for analysis of antioxidant
enzymes;17 10 l of butylated hydroxytoluene (0.5 M in
acetonitrile) was added to prevent homogenate from oxi-
dation and the homogenate was stored at -70°C until
analysis for malonyldialdehyde.
Biochemical analysis
For the assessment of kidney function plasma samples
were assayed for urea18 and creatinine.19 Urea was esti-
mated by an enzymatic method and creatinine by Jaffe's
method.
Plasma total protein was analysed by the Biuret
method.20 Serum C-reactive protein was estimated by parti-
cle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay using the Biolatex
kit,21 nitrite by Griess' reaction.22 For electrolyte analysis
the end point method was used. Serum sodium and potas-
sium were analysed by the method of Henry et al.,23 serum
calcium by the method of Moorehead and Biggs,24 and
serum chloride by the method of Feldkamp et al.25
For serum ACE activity the colorimetric enzymatic
assay by Studdy and Bird26 was used.
Analysis of ACE gene expression: ACE gene expres-
sion was estimated by the method of Korstanje et al.27 A
centimetre of tissue was treated with 500 µl of digestion
buffer (1 mg/ml of proteinase K, 50 mM Tris-Cl of pH
8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic
acid (EDTA) of pH 8.0 and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate
(SDS)) at 55°C. Phenol, chloroform and isoamyl alcohol
was added to the mixture at a ratio of 25:24:1, centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature then
allowed to precipitate by adding 100% ethanol (2 vol-
umes). A dried pellet of DNA was suspended in 1 ml of
Tris EDTA buffer of pH 7.5­8.0. Quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to assess
ACE gene expression.
Analysis of renal tissue oxidant status
Tissue catalase was estimated by the method of Sinha.28
Briefly, tissue homogenate was mixed with phosphate
buffer of pH 7.0 and added to 1 ml of 0.2 M hydrogen
peroxide solution. Then it was added to 2 ml of 5% dichro-
mate acetic acid solution and boiled for 10 minutes, cooled
with tap water and absorbance was read at 570 nm on a
Schimadzu spectrophotometer UV-120-01. The activity
was calculated as µm/g of tissue.
Tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD) was estimated by
the method of Kono.29 Briefly, the reaction mixture con-
sisted of 1.3 ml of EDTA­Na2
CO3
solution, 0.5 ml of 90
µm nitroblue tetrazolium solution (NBT), 0.1 ml of Triton
X-100 EDTA solution of pH 10.0 and 0.1 ml 20 mM
hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution of pH 6.0. The rate
of NBT reduction of the reaction mixture was recorded per
minute on a Schimadzu UV spectrophotometer at 560 nm
then added to 0.1 ml of tissue homogenate. The percentage
inhibition of NBT reduction rate was recorded at U/g of
tissue.
Tissue glutathione was estimated by the method of
Carlberg and Mannervik.30 Briefly, the reaction mixture
consisted of 0.1 ml tissue homogenate, 0.3 ml of 10%
bovine serum albumin, 1.5 ml 50 mM Potassium phosphate
buffer (KPO4
) buffer of pH 7.6, 0.35 ml of 0.8 Mm  reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
and 0.1 ml of 30 mM oxidised glutathione. Absorbance was
recorded on a kinetic spectrophotometer PRIM 500 for 5
minutes at 25°C. The tissue glutathione level was estimated
as U/g of tissue.
Tissue malonyldialdehyde was estimated by the method
of Okhawa et al.31 Briefly, the reaction mixture consisted of
0.2 ml of SDS, 1.5 ml of acetic acid of pH 3.5, 1.5 ml of
aqueous thiobarbituric acid and 0.2 ml of tissue homogen-
ate. Distilled water was added to make up the volume to
4 ml, the mixture was then heated at 95°C for 60 minutes,
cooled with tap water and centrifuged. Then 1 ml of distilled
water and 5 ml of n-butanol and pyridine (15:1 v/v) were
added. A pink coloured organic layer was read at 532 nm on
a Schimadzu UV spectrophotometer. The tissue malonyldi-
aldehyde concentration was measured as nmol/g of tissue.
Results
Histological examination of hyperlipidaemic rats showed
proliferation with moderate interstitial inflammation.
While lycopene-treated rats showed no such proliferation
as shown in group III; however, mild interstitial inflam-
mation was observed. Alone lycopene-treated rats showed
no significant changes when compared with the positive
controls.
The urea level was significantly increased in hyperlipi-
daemic rats when compared with negative controls
(P<0.005). A partial decrease was observed when treated
with lycopene as shown in group III when compared with
the positive controls (P<0.05), while lycopene treatment
also showed a significant decrease in the urea level when
compared with negative/positive controls. The creatinine
level was significantly increased in hyperlipidaemic rats
(P<0.005) when compared with negative controls, while
no significant results were observed with lycopene treat-
ment when compared with positive controls.

groups. The value P<0.05 was considered significant.
Discussion
The biochemical parameters that monitored the kidneys
are the markers of kidney toxicity and are used for the
assessment of tissue damage. The measurement of differ-
ent parameters, their levels and their activities are used for
the diagnosis.32 Hypercholesterolaemia accelerates the
progression of kidney disease.33 Urea and creatinine levels
are used as an indicator of nephrotoxicity as low clearance
of these substances indicates diminished or impaired abil-
ity of the kidney to clear the body's waste products.34 We
found increased urea and creatinine levels in hyperlipidae-
mic rats showing their nephrotoxic effect (Table 1,
P<0.005). Treatment of hyperlipidaemic rats with lyco-
pene produced significantly decreased urea and creatinine
levels (P<0.05) suggesting its nephroprotective effect
against hyperlipidaemia. Kidney tissues indicated from the
histological examination that lycopene antioxidant activity
protects the renal parenchyma from oxidative damage and
thus modulates the endogenous cholesterol synthesis and
metabolism and reduces the intensity of hyperlipidaemia-
based nephrotoxicity (Figure 1).

Among the numerous markers for the detection of
hyperlipidaemia, an imbalance in antioxidant status was
observed in diet-induced hyperlipidaemia. Increases in
the activity of lipid peroxidation and oxidant enzymes
included NADPH oxidase, myeloperoxidase and xanthine
oxidase. NADPH oxidase has been recognised within
the vascular wall and has a great impact on reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-related decreased nitric oxide (NO)
bioavailability.35 In the pathological condition overactivity
of these enzymes leads to the overproduction of free radi-
cals, leading to scavenging of the NO molecule, uncou-
pling endothelial NO synthase or/and formation of
peroxynitrite.36 Uncoupling of endothelial NO synthase
with substrate reduction can transform into a superoxide
generating enzyme, which in turn increases the production
of oxidant radicals, hydrogen peroxide along with NO
Khan et al. 7
production.37 A range of antioxidant mechanisms balances
the effects of ROS including catalase, superoxide dismutase
and glutathione. The present investigation indicated a high
concentration of malonyldialdehyde (P<0.01) with a low
tissue catalase level (P<0.05) (Table 4). This result is
corroborated with previous investigators who found a
significantly increased tissue malonyldialdehyde level in
hyperlipidaemia, which was inversely proportional to anti-
oxidant enzymes.38 Lycopene has been shown to be one of
the best biological suppressants of free radicals, especially
those derived from oxygen. It has the highest singlet-
quenching rate among all carotenoids in the biological sys-
tem.12 The findings in the present study demonstrated the
ability of lycopene to protect the kidney tissue from cellular
damage through elevation of antioxidant enzymes.
CRP is a marker of inflammation to predict cardiovascu-
lar disease among healthy humans. It is also used clinically
for the assessment of low-grade cardiovascular inflamma-
tion.39 We found a marked increased CRP level in hyper-
lipidaemic rats (Table 2, P<0.005) and found a significant
effect of lycopene on hyperlipidaemic rats. CRP promotes
endothelial dysfunction and is responsible for atherosclero-
sis.39 Rein et al. studied tomato flavanoids and showed
these substances to reduce the CRP level and fibrinogen in
contrast to increased vitamin E, selenium and serum high-
density lipoprotein.40 Pasceri et al. hypothesised that CRP
via interleukin 6 stimulates vascular dysfunction by inhibit-
ing endothelial NO synthase, increases oxidative stress,
vascular permeability, stimulates the adhesion molecules,
chemokine production, and thrombus formation within the
endothelial cells.41 No significant changes were observed
in the total protein level in hyperlipidaemic rats as shown in
Table 2. While lycopene treatment significantly increased
the total protein level, Ozturk et al.42 found in their study
that intoxication of carbon tetrachloride damaged the cell
membrane and their intracellular organelles and increased
the permeability of the basement membrane of the kidney
thus increasing protein loss in the urine. Lipoprotein cho-
lesterol is an important constituent of the plasma membrane
thus a big change may increase the membrane permeability
and cause lipid peroxidation.43
The significantly increased total protein level in group
III may suggest that preferential deposition of lycopene in
organs such as the liver may be implicated.44
Hyperlipidaemia is characterised by hyponatraemia
usually giving rise to derangements of homeostatic bal-
ance with respect to electrolytes.45 Although no changes
were observed in serum electrolytes, including sodium,
potassium chloride on hyperlipidaemic-treated rats when
compared with negative controls, following treatment with
lycopene the serum level of sodium, calcium chloride did
not differ with hyperlipidaemic rats when compared.
Whereas the serum potassium level showed significant
results following treatment with lycopene when compared
with negative controls.
Recent evidence indicates that major cardiovascular
risk factors influence the renin­angiotensin system func-
tion, including an increased synthesis of the angiotensin I
converting enzyme.46 The present investigation indicates
the increased ACE serum activity and gene expression
in hyperlipidaemic rats. Niemiec et al. investigated hyper-
lipidaemia, which is one of the major risk factors of
cardiovascular arterial disease, increasing the plasma con-
centration of angiotensinogen and the angiotensin peptides
and upregulating the expression of the angiotensin II type
1 receptor (AT1R) gene.47 Suzuki et al. found strong cor-
relation between the DD genotype and the D allele with
hyperlipidaemia.48 In smokers, the D allele has been asso-
ciated with endothelial dysfunction, resulting in increased
levels of angiotensin II, which has been shown to increase
the formation of SOD anions and the degradation of NO
causing endothelial dysfunction.49 Treatment of hyperlipi-
daemic rats with lycopene significantly reduced the serum
ACE level and gene expression, suggesting that lycopene
has strong anion quenching ability as compared to other
carotenoids and gives a protective effect.50
Conclusion
The results obtained from the present study demonstrated
that lycopene significantly attenuated the urea and creati-
nine level and also improved the tissue kidney oxidant sta-
tus. Lycopene treatment also regulated the serum ACE and
gene expression. Thus our findings suggest the ability of
lycopene to protect the kidney tissues dysregulated by
HFD-induced hyperlipidaemia.
