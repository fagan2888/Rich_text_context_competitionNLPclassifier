Parochial Empathy Predicts Reduced
Altruism and the Endorsement
of Passive Harm
Emile G. Bruneau1,2, Mina Cikara3, and Rebecca Saxe2
Abstract
Empathic failures are common in hostile intergroup contexts; repairing empathy is therefore a major focus of peacebuilding
efforts. However, it is unclear which aspect of empathy is most relevant to intergroup conflict. Although trait empathic concern
predicts prosociality in interpersonal settings, we hypothesized that the best predictor of meaningful intergroup attitudes and
behaviors might not be the general capacity for empathy (i.e., trait empathy), but the difference in empathy felt for the in-group
versus the out-group, or "parochial empathy." Specifically, we predicted that out-group empathy would inhibit intergroup harm
and promote intergroup helping, whereas in-group empathy would have the opposite effect. In three intergroup contexts--
Americans regarding Arabs, Hungarians regarding refugees, Greeks regarding Germans--we found support for this hypothesis.
In all samples, in-group and out-group empathy had independent, significant, and opposite effects on intergroup outcomes,
controlling for trait empathic concern.

In our everyday lives, we count on empathic people to do
altruistic things. In interpersonal interactions, this assumption
is supported by studies showing that empathic concern (EC)
is associated with prosocial behaviors (Batson, 2014; Eisenberg
& Miller, 1987). For example, observers who experience more
EC for a needy individual are more likely to engage in costly
helping, including volunteering more time, donating more
money, and taking on boring or painful tasks (Batson, Chang,
Orr, & Rowland, 2002; Batson, Duncan, Ackerman, Buckley,
& Birch, 1981; Fultz, Batson, Fortenbach, McCarthy, &
Varney, 1986). A large literature has also demonstrated that dis-
positional EC is associated with prosocial behavior and inten-
tions (Eisenberg, Eggum, & Di Giunta, 2010) and also with a
decrease in antisocial behaviors, such as bullying (Jolliffe &
Farrington, 2006; Raskauskas, Gregory, Harvey, Rifshana, &
Evans, 2010).
Since empathy is involved in providing help and withhold-
ing harm toward others, it has been suggested that empathy
may play a vital role in preventing intergroup conflict and facil-
itating reconciliation (Batson & Ahmad, 2009). Many conflict
resolution programs have therefore adopted fostering empathy
as a primary program goal. However, there is reason to believe
that boosting overall EC may not provide a universal palliative
in intergroup settings. In fact, interviews with those who
engage in (or attempt) extreme intergroup violence indicate that
these individuals are characterized not by a lack of empathy but
rather by high levels of empathy and communal concern for
their in-group (Argo, 2009). Similarly, among Israelis and
Palestinians, the willingness to endorse out-group harm is asso-
ciated with EC toward their own communities (Ginges &
Atran, 2009; see also Lickel, Miller, Stenstrom, Denson, &
Schmader, 2006). Therefore, in some cases, inducing empathy
may not only fail to heal intergroup wounds, but it may moti-
vate out-group hostility. Understanding how different facets of
empathy influence intergroup conflicts is critical to practical
conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts. It is also of great
theoretical significance, given the prominent role that empathy
plays in many models of intergroup relations (e.g., Batson &
Ahmad, 2009; Lickel et al., 2006; Stephan & Stephan, 2001).
The opposing predictions about the effect of empathy on
intergroup conflict can be resolved if we think of empathy not
only as an interpersonal process but also as a group-based emo-
tion--an emotional response that arises because of, or is

shaped by, social identities (Smith & Mackie, 2016). Group-
based emotions can motivate us to act on behalf of our in-
group and/or against hostile out-groups. For example, people
experience anger after an in-group insult but only to the extent
that they identify with that group (Rydell et al., 2008). Simi-
larly, shame and guilt may be felt more strongly by those who
identify with or feel attached to their group: Americans feel
more shame when considering the poor treatment of Arabs in
the United States in the wake of 9/11 (Johns, Schmader, &
Lickel, 2005), and among Americans and Israelis, identifica-
tion (ID) or attachment to the group, respectively, facilitates
group-based guilt about the poor treatment of minorities in
their society (Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, & Manstead,
2006; Roccas, Klar, & Liviatan, 2006).
In the current work, we take an intergroup emotions theory
(Mackie, Maitner, & Smith, 2009) perspective of empathy and
suggest that intergroup empathy has two simultaneous effects:
If we feel empathy for individual out-group members, it may
motivate action on behalf of that out-group; whereas if we feel
empathy for individual in-group members, it may motivate
action against the out-group. What types of behavior might
intergroup empathy most likely motivate? Whereas moral emo-
tions like shame and guilt have been associated with concilia-
tory gestures (e.g., support of negotiations or reparations), and
negative emotions like anger have been shown to precipitate
active harm, empathy has been most strongly associated with
altruism. Therefore, we predicted that low out-group empathy
and high in-group empathy would be most strongly associated
with withholding altruistic behavior toward the out-group, or
preventing others from easing out-group suffering (i.e., "pas-
sive harm"). From this perspective, the people most likely to
withhold out-group altruism or engage in passive harm,
would not be those low in trait levels of empathy, such as psy-
chopaths (Baron-Cohen, 2012), but rather those who simulta-
neously display low out-group empathy and high in-group
empathy. Thus, by contrast to interpersonal interactions, inter-
group interactions may be best predicted by the parochial dis-
tribution of empathy toward in-group versus out-group
members, which we term here "parochial empathy" (Bruneau,
Cikara, & Saxe, 2015) or "intergroup empathy bias" (Cikara,
Bruneau, & Saxe, 2011).
The intergroup emotions perspective on empathy leads to
three predictions: First, the amount of empathy felt for out-
group members will correlate with social ID with the out-
group, and the amount of empathy felt for in-group members
will correlate with social ID with the in-group. Second,
intergroup emotions will predict out-group attitudes and beha-
vior--that is, greater empathy for individual out-group mem-
bers will predict greater altruism (and less hostility) toward
the out-group and vice versa. Because "in-group love" can
be distinct from "out-group hate" (Brewer, 1999), in-group
and out-group empathy should predict behavior indepen-
dently of each other. Finally, parochial empathy may be inde-
pendent of interpersonal empathy, predicting altruism and
antagonism across salient group boundaries, above and
beyond trait levels of empathy.
Current Research
The goal of the present work is to demonstrate the conse-
quences of intergroup empathy in a range of real intergroup
contexts. Since we predict that in-group empathy and out-
group empathy will have opposite effects on out-group atti-
tudes and behavior, a parsimonious way to operationalize
intergroup empathy is by calculating the difference in empa-
thy felt toward in-group versus out-group members, within
subjects. We take this approach in the current work. However,
since a single difference score fails to reveal the individual
effects of each component of empathy, and therefore obscures
their independent contributions, we also examine in-group
and out-group empathy as independent factors. In Experiment
1, we tested whether parochial empathy (1) predicted out-
group attitudes and costly altruism over time and (2) mediated
the effect of social ID on these outcomes. In Studies 2 and 3,
we examined another key question: (3) whether parochial
empathy predicted out-group attitudes and costly helping
above and beyond trait EC.
Experiment 1: Parochial Empathy
in Americans Regarding Arabs
To examine parochial empathy, we presented American par-
ticipants with fortunes and misfortunes experienced by
Americans (in-group) and Arabs (out-group) by adapting a
paradigm used previously with novel groups (Cikara, Bru-
neau, Van Bavel, & Saxe, 2014; Bruneau et al., 2015).1
Given that the United States has been involved in continual
warfare with at least one Arab-majority country since 2001,
these groups are characterized by a hostile relationship. We
hypothesized that (1) both in-group empathy and out-group
empathy would independently predict diminished altruistic
(i.e., costly helping) behavior toward the out-group, and
given that intergroup emotions are fundamentally shaped
by social identities, that (2) the difference in empathy
expressed toward in-group versus out-group members (paro-
chial empathy) would mediate the effect of social identity on
out-group behavior.
Method
Participants
We recruited a sample of American participants (N = 100)
via Amazon's Mechanical Turk website. Previous studies
using a similar paradigm recruited 50­100 participants
(Cikara et al., 2014); because the current study focused on
individual differences, rather than mean effects, we planned
a priori to recruit at the top end of this scale (N = 100). Data
collection was terminated automatically after 100 individuals
completed the study. Of the participants, 16 missed one of
the two attention check questions embedded in the survey,
leaving 84 participants (Mage
= 37.0, standard deviation
[SD] = 12.0; 51.2% male).

Experimental Design
Procedure. The procedure was adapted from a paradigm devel-
oped by Cikara, Bruneau, Van Bavel, and Saxe (2014). Briefly,
after being provided with a cover story for the research (i.e., to
examine "directional problem-solving" in people who learned
languages that are written in different directions), English-
speaking American participants were told that they would be
playing as a member of an English-speaking team in a problem
solving challenge, against a team of people who speak Arabic.
Participants were told that individual scores would be tallied
and added to the total team score for both teams and that the
first team to 100 points would win the challenge.
Prior to the challenge, participants reported where they grew
up, their background, and an event that happened to them in the
past week. After being assigned to a team (English speakers)
and told that they were (apparently randomly) assigned to com-
pete against Arabic speakers, participants were told that they
would read the events that people from their team and the other
team had reported.
Participants then read the events of eight English-speaking
people on their team (in-group) and the eight Arabic-
speaking people on the other team (out-group). The 16 specific
events were adapted from previous work (Cikara et al., 2014)
and adjusted to be culturally neutral (e.g., "[target] came down
with a serious illness"). Each event description included the tar-
get's group membership (e.g., "Beth is from NORTH
DAKOTA" or "Salma is from EGYPT") and the target's lan-
guage ("English" or " 









 "). Events were randomly
assigned to either an in-group or an out-group target, such that
each participant viewed eight in-group events (four positive
and four negative) and eight out-group events (four positive
and four negative). For each of the 16 events, participants
reported how good and how bad it made them feel that the
event happened to the target. Not all measures are reported here
(for full survey, see Supplemental Materials).
Parochial empathy was measured as the degree to which
people felt good about in-group versus out-group fortunes and
bad about in-group versus out-group misfortunes. For the pur-
poses of the mediation analysis, parochial empathy was calcu-
lated as in-group empathy minus out-group empathy.
Intergroup ID was assessed using the Inclusion of In-group
and Out-group in the Self measure (Schubert & Otten, 2002).
The degree of overlap with the in-group using this measure has
been demonstrated previously to reflect in-group ID (Tropp &
Wright, 2001). Participants used their mouse to drag the "self"
circle closer or further away from the "group" circle on screen,
providing a continuous measure of self/in-group and self/out-
group ID.
Following the measures above, participants were presented
with eight progressive Raven's Matrices (which involve direc-
tional problem-solving, supporting the cover story).
Out-group altruism. After finishing the Raven's Matrices, parti-
cipants were given the opportunity to complete additional prob-
lems (up to 20), with each correct problem providing a US$.10
donation to the "Arab Red Crescent Society." At the bottom of
each problem were buttons to "opt out" and skip to the end of
the study or "continue" to the next charity problem. The num-
ber of problems completed for charity provided a measure of
costly altruism.
Follow-Up Survey
One week later, participants were provided with a link to a
follow-up survey, which 68 (81%) completed (and passed the
check question). Those who did and did not complete the
follow-up survey did not differ on age, gender, in-group ID,
out-group ID, in-group empathy, out-group empathy, or the
number of tasks completed for charity (ps > .25).
The follow-up survey included exploratory measures that
paralleled unrelated concurrent cross-cultural research: emo-
tions toward Arabs associated with stereotype content (envy,
pride, disgust, and pity), prejudice and dehumanization toward
Arabs, and emotional responses to injustices committed against
Arabs. These items are not examined here. Also included in the
follow-up survey were outcome measures associated with out-
group helping designed for the current study (support for Arab
immigration, donation to out-group members; for full survey,
see Supplemental Materials).
Support Arab immigration assessed the percentage of U.S.
VISAS participants thought should be awarded to each of the fol-
lowing groups: Arabs, East Asians, Hispanics, Africans, and East-
ern Europeans (Kteily, Bruneau, Waytz, & Cotterill, 2015). We
used as our measure the percent of VISAS granted to Arabs.
Out-group donation assessed participants' altruistic beha-
vior by providing them with a monetary bonus to distribute
between an in-group cause (relief fund for victims of the Bos-
ton Marathon bombings) versus an out-group cause (relief fund
for civilian victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan and Yemen;
Kteily et al., 2015). The amount of money participants donated
to the out-group cause provided our measure of out-group pro-
social behavior.
Mediation Test
To test for mediation, we constructed three separate models
using PROCESS (Hayes, 2013). Each model had the difference
between in-group and out-group ID as the predictor, the differ-
ence between in-group and out-group empathy (i.e., parochial
empathy) as the mediator and one of the outcome measures as
the dependent variable. To test the specificity of mediation, we
examined both the predicted mediation relationship (intergroup
ID as independent variable, parochial empathy as mediator) and
the reverse (parochial empathy as independent variable, inter-
group ID as mediator), as suggested by Hayes (2013).
Results
As predicted, American participants reported stronger ID with
the in-group (M = 87.6, SD = 18.1) than the out-group
(M = 44.3, SD = 23.4), t(83) = 12.20, p < .001, Cohen's
936 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(8)
d = 2.09. We took as our measure of "intergroup ID" the dif-
ference between these social identity measures--this measure
correlated significantly with all outcome measures (rs > .23,
ps < .04). American participants also had stronger empathic
responses to Americans (M = 80.7, SD = 12.2) than Arabs
(M = 78.3, SD = 15.2), t(83) = 2.10, p = .039, Cohen's d =
.18. We calculated parochial empathy as the difference between
the empathy measures. Parochial empathy correlated signifi-
cantly with all outcome measures (rs > .24, ps < .03), and inter-
group ID and parochial empathy were significantly correlated
with each other, (84) = .350, p = .001).
The main analyses of interest examined the ability of paro-
chial empathy to predict outcomes at Time 1 (immediately after
the in-group and out-group empathy judgments) and Time 2
(1 week after the empathy task), controlling for intergroup
ID. We first tested the specific hypothesis that the constituent
components of parochial empathy are independently associated
with out-group behaviors--that is, that out-group empathy
drives prosocial out-group actions, while in-group empathy
inhibits such actions. We mean centered all predictors and
entered them simultaneously. As predicted, in-group and out-
group empathy were independent and significant predictors
of immigration support and donations at Time 2, above and
beyond in-group and out-group ID (Table 1). In-group and
out-group empathy did not predict the Time 1 outcome, beyond
in-group and out-group ID.
We also examined the specific prediction that parochial
empathy serves as a direct psychological motivator of out-
group behavior through mediation analyses. We found that
parochial empathy mediated the effect of intergroup ID on all
outcome measures: Out-group altruism (indirect effect:
-.0112, SE = .0072, 95% CI [-.0292, -.0014]), Arab immigra-
tion support (indirect effect: -.0316, SE = .0164, 95% CI
[-.0693, -.0086]), and out-group donation (indirect effect:
-.0006, SE = .0003, 95% CI [-.0014, -.0001]; Figure 1).
Importantly, the alternate model (i.e., intergroup ID mediating
effects of parochial empathy on outcomes) was not significant
for any of these outcome measures (95% CI of indirect effects
for all models included 0).
Therefore, Experiment 1 supported the prediction that
parochial empathy is an important predictor of attitudes and
behavior in consequential intergroup contexts, mediating the
effect of social identity on outcomes. Study 2 sought to repli-
cate and extend these results by examining the predictive valid-
ity of parochial empathy in a different cultural context and
directly comparing the contribution of parochial empathy and
trait EC to out-group attitudes and altruism.
Experiment 2: Parochial Empathy Among
Hungarians During the Refugee Crisis
Experiment 1 demonstrated that parochial empathy mediates
the effect of intergroup ID on out-group-oriented attitudes and
behavior. In Experiment 2, we sought to (1) confirm the role of
parochial empathy in predicting outcomes in an independent
sample and (2) determine whether parochial empathy predicts
outcomes beyond trait EC. In Study 2, we examined Hungarian
empathy toward Hungarians and Muslim refugees during the
European "Refugee Crisis."
In early 2015, the Hungarian government launched a major
anti-immigration campaign, which included billboards and
high-profile comments by Hungarian leaders citing concern for
the welfare of in-group members during the influx of Muslim

refugees from conflicts in the Middle East. At the same time,
empathy toward the refugees was fostered by media coverage
of the wars that drove them from home, and the harrowing
journey across the Mediterranean, which resulted in thousands
of drowning deaths. In particular, in September 2015, the
image of Aylan Kurdi, a 2-year-old Syrian boy whose drowned
body was collected on a beach in Turkey, was transmitted
around the world, resulting in up to 60-fold increases in dona-
tions to refugee charities for weeks afterward (Gladstone &
Zraick, 2015). Experiment 2 was conducted 2 months after the
Aylan Kurdi photo was published and 1 month after the peak
(until now) of refugees coming to Europe (220,000 arrivals
in October 2015; United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
ugees, 2016). This intergroup context therefore seemed well
suited to examine parochial empathy.
Method
Participants
We recruited a sample of 604 Hungarian participants (the largest
sample we could collect given funding constraints) in late Novem-
ber 2015 through a Hungarian survey company (Kerdoivem); the
sample was representative of Hungary in terms of age and gen-
der. Of the participants, 102 missed one of the two attention
check questions embedded in the survey, leaving 502 parti-
cipants (Mage
= 40.56, SD = 13.15; 46.6% male).
Experimental Design
Participants were provided with a survey (in Hungarian), which
included measures of parochial empathy, trait empathy, and
three outcome measures, as described below. The survey
included other measures of interest examined elsewhere
(Bruneau, Kteily, & Laustsen, 2017; for full survey, see
Supplemental Materials).
Parochial empathy was assessed through eight scenarios
involving individual misfortunes (e.g., "[Hungarians/Muslim
refugees] whose children don't do well in school"; for full set
of stimuli, see Supplemental Materials). Each scenario had an
in-group (Hungarian) target version and an out-group (Muslim
refugee) target version. Participants were randomly presented
with one set of four misfortunes attributed to the out-group
( = .90), and then the other set of four misfortunes attributed
to the in-group ( = .82). For each story, participants indicated
empathy for the target ("How much empathy do you feel for
[target]?" from 1 "none at all" to 5 "a lot"). Parochial empathy
was assessed as in-group versus out-group empathy.
Trait EC was measured with the Empathic Concern subscale
of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983;  = .80).
Anti-refugee policies support was assessed by providing
participants with four policies that were debated during Eur-
ope's refugee "crisis": for example, "We should dramatically
decrease the amount of aid we provide to refugees in order
to deter them from trying to come to our country" (reverse
coded). Ratings were made using sliders anchored at 0
(strongly oppose) and 100 (strongly support;  = .84).
Asylum was assessed by asking how many refugees partici-
pants would be willing to accept into Hungary: "Of the esti-
mated 1,000,000 refugees who could reach Europe this year,
how many do you think Hungary should grant asylum to,
allowing them to live there permanently? (range: 0­40,000)."
Because of the large range of possible responses, results were
log transformed.
Sign prorefugee petition provided participants with the
opportunity to sign a petition in support of refugee aid. Partici-
pants reported whether they wanted their vote counted against
the petition (coded -1), for the petition (coded 1), or if they did
not want their vote counted (coded 0).
Results
Hungarian participants reported stronger empathic responses to
the misfortunes of in-group Hungarians (M = 3.34, SD = .81)
compared to out-group Muslim refugees (M = 3.06,
SD = 1.00), t(501) = 9.4, p < .001, Cohen's d = .31. Trait
EC was correlated positively and quite strongly with both in-
group empathy, r(502) = .40, p < .001, and out-group empathy,
r(502) = .46, p < .001), suggesting that trait EC is a good pre-
dictor of empathic responses toward both in-group and out-
group targets. On the other hand, trait EC was significantly less
strongly correlated with parochial empathy, r(502) = -.21, p =
< .001 (Steiger's Zs > 8.9, ps < .001).
We next tested how strongly trait empathy and parochial
empathy correlated with support for outcomes relevant to Mus-
lim refugees: support for anti-refugee policies, the number of
Muslim refugees Hungarians thought should be allowed to set-
tle in Hungary, and willingness to sign a petition in support of
refugees. Consistent with the American sample, in-group and
out-group empathy independently and significantly predicted
each of the outcome measures, even when controlling for trait
EC (Table 2).2 Controlling for trait EC, parochial empathy
strongly predicted all outcome measures: support for anti-
refugee policies ( = .42, p < .001), the number of refugees par-
ticipants felt should be settled in Hungary ( = -.47, p < .001),
and willingness to sign a petition in support of refugees
( = -.33, p < .001); results were similar when we controlled
in the regression analyses for age, gender, and conservatism
(||s > .23, ps < .001).
These results again highlight the importance of parochial
empathy in intergroup contexts through the independent effects
of out-group and in-group empathy. Study 2 also illustrated that
parochial empathy is distinct from trait EC and is a stronger
predictor of outcomes. In Study 3, we sought to replicate the
results of Study 2 in yet another consequential intergroup con-
text, with an outcome measure associated with support for pas-
sive out-group harm.
Experiment 3: Parochial Empathy Among
Greeks During the Greek Depression
Two years after the global financial crisis that began in 2007,
Greece experienced what is now known as the "Greek
938 Social Psychological and Personality Science 8(8)
Depression." Greek debt ballooned to 30,000 per capita,
which was held mostly in German banks. When Greece
appealed to the European Union to relieve some of their debt
as part of a bailout plan, their appeal was largely rejected, par-
ticularly by Germany, and harsh austerity measures were insti-
tuted with widespread consequences for individual Greeks that
were well documented in the media. Claims of predatory lend-
ing by Germany and German hypocrisy were common in
Greece, and anti-German sentiments were strong. In the wake
of these sociopolitical decisions, we assessed trait empathy,
parochial empathy, and anti-German hostility in a large sample
of Greeks.
Method
Participants
We recruited 545 Greek participants (the largest sample we
could collect given funding constraints) to participate in the
survey in late September 2015 through a Greek survey com-
pany ("The Hellenic Research House"). Of the participants,
78 missed an attention check question embedded in the sur-
vey, resulting in 467 participants (Mage
= 39.24, SD = 10.36;
36% male).
Experimental Design
Participants were provided with an omnibus survey (in Greek),
which included measures of parochial empathy, trait empathy,
and the outcome measures. Other measures (e.g., outcomes
related to the Roma minority population) are not reported here
(for full survey, see Supplemental Materials).
Parochial empathy was assessed as in Study 2, this time
toward German (out-group;  = .86/.74 for Versions 1 and 2)
and Greek (in-group) targets ( = .70/.67 for Versions 1 and 2).
Trait EC was measured with the Empathic Concern subscale
of the IRI ( = .69).
Save German lives provided participants with a hypothetical
scenario in which Greek intelligence could pursue information
that would cost considerable resources but could result in the
thwarting of a terror attack in Germany (i.e., costly helping).
Participants were asked to respond how strongly they sup-
ported following the lead (and spending Greek resources to
potentially save German lives; for full description, see Supple-
mental Materials).
Passive harm was assessed with 6 items (e.g., "If Germany
were to have a natural disaster, I think Greece should withhold
financial support";  = .76). Responses were provided on
unmarked sliders anchored at "completely disagree" (0) and
"completely agree" (100).
Results
Greek participants reported stronger empathic responses to the
misfortunes of in-group Greeks (M = 4.06, SD = .73) compared
to out-group Germans (M = 3.47, SD = 1.00), t(466) = 13.3,
p < .001, Cohen's d = .68. Consistent with Study 2, we found
that trait EC was significantly correlated with empathy for in-
group targets, r(467) = .29, p < .001, and empathy for out-
group targets, r(467) = .28, p < .001. On the other hand, trait
EC and parochial empathy were uncorrelated, r(467) = -.07,
p = .11.
Consistent with Experiment 2, but this time with a mea-
sure of passive harm rather than active help, in-group and
out-group empathy independently and significantly pre-
dicted the degree to which participants supported passive
harm against Germany, controlling for trait EC. Only out-
group empathy significantly predicted willingness to
engage in costly helping to spare German lives (Table 3).3
Controlling for trait EC, parochial empathy predicted support
for passive harm ( = .36, p < .001) and costly helping to
save German lives ( = -.25, p < .001). Results for all
regression analyses were similar if age, gender, and conser-
vatism were included as additional regressors. Therefore,
parochial empathy not only predicted the withholding of pro-
social behavior toward an out-group but also support for pas-
sive harm.
General Discussion
Across three experiments, we examined parochial empathy and
its effects on attitudes and behavior toward threatening out-
groups. In the context of American/Arab relations (Study 1),
in-group and out-group empathy each independently and sig-
nificantly predicted long-term attitudes and behavior toward
Arabs and mediated the effect of intergroup ID on these out-
comes. In the context of Hungarian/refugees (Study 2) and
Greek/German relations (Study 3), in-group and out-group
empathy significantly and oppositely predicted altruistic

attitudes and behaviors toward Muslim refugees (in Hungar-
ians) and passive harm of Germans (in Greeks), this time con-
trolling for trait EC.
Across a range of intergroup contexts, we found that while
trait EC was correlated with both in-group and out-group
empathy ratings separately, trait EC was not correlated with the
difference between in-group and out-group empathy (i.e., paro-
chial empathy). More importantly, across all three cultural con-
texts, parochial empathy was a stronger predictor of altruism
and passive harm toward out-groups than was trait empathy.
Indeed, the current research indicates that trait EC is a poor
predictor of out-group altruism and out-group passive harm.
Rather, the research reported here supports an alternative empa-
thy profile for those who withhold aid and advocate passive
harm to the out-group: Low enough empathy for the out-
group that withholding help or condoning harm is emotionally
acceptable, and simultaneously high enough empathy for in-
group members that they are sufficiently motivated to withhold
help or condone harm on their behalf.
Empathy is one of a number of emotions that are shaped by
social identities. For example, moral emotions, such as guilt and
shame in response to in-group transgressions, have been shown
to drive intergroup forgiveness and foster reconciliation, and
positive emotions (e.g., hope) have been shown to similarly ease
intergroup aggression (Cohen-Chen, Halperin, Crisp, & Gross,
2013). On the other hand, negative emotions such as anger and
hatred drive conflict and prevent reconciliation (in some circum-
stances; e.g., Halperin, 2008). Obviously, the internal forces that
ultimately pull someone toward and away from intergroup con-
flict are numerous, and mapping the unique contributions of
each of these forces will be an important undertaking.
One avenue for future research will be to determine which
intergroup outcomes are best predicted by each intergroup
emotion. Here, we focused on outcomes that we hypothesized
would be most directly affected by intergroup empathy: inter-
group altruism and passive harm. On the other hand, previous
research has shown that the approach motivated emotion of
anger effectively drives support for (or engagement in) more
active intergroup harm (Lickel et al., 2006; Spanovic, Lickel,
Denson, & Petrovic, 2010). Future studies could test whether
increasing moral emotions like shame may foster more indirect,
symbolic gestures to the aggrieved out-group, such as a formal
apology or an offer of reparations, whereas decreasing paro-
chial empathy may be more likely to foster prosocial interper-
sonal gestures, such as helping an out-group target. At the same
time, future work could also examine how intergroup emotions
interact with each other to drive conflict. For example, it would
be interesting to determine the potential relationship between
in-group empathy, intergroup anger, and active harm of the
out-group. This approach could connect the work on parochial
empathy, examined here, with related research on "empathic
anger" (Vitaglione & Barnett, 2003).
Finally, it is important to note some limitations of the cur-
rent research. Although we replicated the main effects across
a range of cultural contexts, the empathy measures were based
on self-report and therefore subject to demand characteristics.
Future performance-based or neuroimaging measures could
be used to circumvent this issue. Additionally, the measures
used in the current research were constrained to one facet of
intergroup empathy (i.e., EC). Future research should also
examine different forms of intergroup empathy. For example,
personal distress (the amount of anxiety or distress one feels
in the presence of others' suffering) is another type of empathy
that could be examined in the intergroup contexts. Personal dis-
tress has generally been found to be associated with avoidance
rather than helping when avoidance is an option (Batson, Fultz,
& Schoenrade, 1987). However, if the distressing situation can-
not be avoided, personal distress has been shown to predict
altruism even better than EC (Batson et al., 1981). It would
therefore be interesting to determine the degree to which inter-
group empathy as personal distress motivates behavior in the
context of intergroup conflict, particularly in protracted con-
flicts that that may feel inescapable.
Conclusion
Across three distinct intergroup contexts, we show here that the
distribution of empathy between in-group and out-group mem-
bers (i.e., parochial empathy) mediates the effect of "parochial
identification" on outcome measures and predicts outcomes
independent of (and better than) trait EC. A major implication
of this work is that conflict resolution interventions or pro-
grams aimed at increasing overall empathy in members of par-
tisan groups, for example by taking others' perspectives while

tano, 2013), may have little or no effect on increasing inter-
group harmony or decreasing the likelihood of intergroup
violence (Zaki & Cikara, 2015). Future work should therefore
determine which interventions affect parochial empathy, sepa-
rately from trait EC.

Notes
1. In the current paradigm, empathy was measured according to a
common operationalization: an affective state that is congruent
with another's (Eisenberg & Miller, 1987)--that is, feeling good
in response to someone's fortunes and bad in response to their mis-
fortunes. These state measures were chosen to approximate our
trait measure of empathic concern, a conceptualization of empathy
that has been associated with altruism and intergroup outcomes
across scores of studies (e.g., Batson et al., 2002, 1981, 1987,
1997; FeldmanHall et al., 2015).
2. We included in the analyses the outcome measures that seemed
most salient to the "refugee crisis." However, three other measures
in the survey could also be considered outcome measures: the
amount of social distance participants reported feeling from Mus-
lim refugees ( = .87), anger, guilt, and shame expressed in
response to a story about Muslim refugees being abused by Hun-
garians ( = .87) and support for anti-Muslim policies in general
( = .70). For these measures also, in-group and out-group empa-
thy were independent significant predictors (||s > .17, ps < .005),
controlling for trait empathic concern; results were similar when con-
trolling for age, gender, and conservatism ((||s > .19, ps < .001; see
Table S1).
3. As with Study 2, social distance ( = .71) was also independently
predicted by in-group empathy ( = .23, p < .001) and out-group
empathy ( = -.40, p < .001), controlling for trait empathic concern
(which did not significantly predict:  = -.07, p = .11). Results
were similar if age, gender, and conservatism were included as
additional regressors.
