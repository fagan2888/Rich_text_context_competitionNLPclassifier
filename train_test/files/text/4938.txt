Introduction
Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the mainstay
of treatment in HIV. It has improved the morbidity and
mortality associated with HIV, turning it into a chronic dis-
ease. However, cART, together with the virus itself,
increases the risk of various metabolic complications,
including obesity,1 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
cardiovascular disease (CVD).2 Indeed, CVD is the lead-
ing cause of death in HIV-infected patients on cART with
a linear increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction
observed with long-term cART exposure.3
Insulin resistance (IR) is central to the development of
cardiometabolic disease,4 being present in 21% of HIV
patients on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy.5 In vitro as well
as single-drug studies in both healthy6 and HIV-infected
patients7 have shown that IR can be induced by both pro-
tease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs). Although newer ARVs are increas-
ingly used in clinical practice, IR still remains an impor-
tant problem; HIV patients (n

Abstract
Background:AntiretroviraltherapyinHIV-positivepatientsleadstoinsulinresistancewhichiscentraltothepathogenesis
of various metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular disease seen in this patient group. We have investigated the
dose­response relationship of telmisartan, an antihypertensive, on adipocytes in vitro in order to determine whether it
may have metabolic beneficial effects.
Methods: Using in vitro chronic toxicity models (3T3-F442A murine and primary human adipocytes), we evaluated the
effects of different concentrations of telmisartan on adipocyte differentiation and adipogenic gene expression using lipid
accumulation assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Adipokine secretion and expression of insulin
signalling mediators were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
Results: Telmisartan partially reversed the deleterious effects of antiretrovirals on adipocyte lipid accumulation,
expression of adipogenic regulators (peroxisome proliferator receptor-gamma and lipin 1), adipokine secretion and
expression of the insulin signalling mediator pAktSer473
. The metabolic effects of telmisartan followed a non-monotonic
response with the maximal effect observed at 5µM in the primary human adipocyte model.
Conclusion: Telmisartan has beneficial metabolic effects in adipocytes in vitro, but its potential to reduce antiretroviral-
induced cardiometabolic disease in HIV-infected individuals needs to be evaluated in a well-designed adequately powered
clinical trial.

either boosted atazanavir (ATV) or boosted darunavir or
raltegravir showed a 1.9-fold increase in homeostatic
model assessment­IR (HOMA-IR) within 4
weeks.8
Importantly, HIV-associated metabolic disease results in
increased healthcare burden; a recent study in the United
States identified the management of IR/diabetes to be the
biggest contributor to the cost burden and resource use
among all HIV-related adverse events studied.9
Adipose tissue is an important determinant of IR and
may therefore play a key role in cART-associated meta-
bolic disease. Adipose tissue has also been shown to be a
reservoir for HIV and a source of chronic inflammation.10
Clinical interventions to arrest or reverse cART-associated
adipose-mediated IR are a potential strategy to reduce the
incidence of T2DM and CVD in HIV-positive patients. To
this end, insulin sensitisers such as thiazolidinediones and
metformin have been trialled, but results from randomised
clinical trials in HIV-positive patients have been disap-
pointing and sometimes deleterious.11­13 There is therefore
a need for novel clinical interventions that can reduce
cART-induced IR in HIV-positive individuals.
Preliminary in vitro studies have suggested that tel-
misartan (TEL), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB),
reduces cART-induced adipose dysfunction by inhibition
of the renin­angiotensin system (RAS).14 In addition to
being an ARB, TEL is also a partial agonist at the peroxi-
some proliferator receptor-gamma (PPAR) receptor,15 a
key regulator of adipose tissue metabolism.16 In this arti-
cle, we further evaluate the effect of TEL on cART-induced
adipocyte dysfunction and IR in a novel chronic in vitro
toxicity model, in addition to assessing its concentration­
response relationship.
Materials and methods
Materials
Murine 3T3-F442A cells were a kind gift from Prof Karen
Chapman (University of Edinburgh). Primary human
abdominal subcutaneous preadipocytes were obtained
commercially from age- and sex-matched healthy donors
(n=3;bodymassindex<25kg/m2;Promocell,Heidelberg,
Germany). Collection of adipose tissue was approved by
local ethics committee and all donors gave informed con-
sent. None of the donors had any known medical condi-
tions (i.e. hypertension, CVD, thyroid disorders, renal
disorders, diabetes or chronic pain conditions) or were on
endocrine, anti-inflammatory, statin, thiazolidinedione or
antihypertensive therapy. Lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir
(RTV), ATV and rosiglitazone (ROSI) were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA) and
TEL was provided by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH
(Ingelheim, Germany). Adipocyte media were obtained
from PromoCell. TaqMan gene expression assays [PPAR
and lipin 1 (LPIN1)] and TaqMan Gene Expression Master
Mix were purchased from Life Technologies Ltd (Paisley,
UK). Singleplex and multiplex enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays (ELISAs) for adipokines [adiponectin,
interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)
and resistin] were obtained from Merck Millipore
(Hertfordshire, UK) and Life Technologies Ltd. A colori-
metric assay for free fatty acid release was obtained from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Estimation of phospho-Akt
(pAktSer473
) and total Akt was performed by sandwich
ELISA kits obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific
(Paisley, UK).
Methods
In vitro chronic adipocyte toxicity model:ARVs accumulate
extensively within the adipocytes,10 and thus, we used a chronic
in vitro toxicity model to mimic this. Briefly, both 3T3-F442A
murine cells and primary human subcutaneous adipocytes
were cultured, induced to differentiate as described
previously,17 and treated with PIs with or without TEL
and/or ROSI throughout adipocyte differentiation. For
3T3-F442A, the cells were cultured with Dulbecco's Mod-
ified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) and
10% foetal calf serum followed by the initiation of differ-
entiation using 10
mg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Pri-
mary human preadipocytes were cultured in a Preadipocyte
Growth Medium which is a low-serum (5%
v/v) medium
optimised for the expansion of human preadipocytes. Once
the cells became 70%­80% confluent, differentiation was
induced by culturing them in the Preadipocyte Differentia-
tion Medium, a serum-free medium, for 3
days followed
by further maintenance of differentiating adipocytes in the
Adipocyte Nutrition Medium. Drug treatment was started
48h post initiation of differentiation and carried out every
48h over a period of 10days (or 12days in the case of pri-
mary human adipocytes). The effects of PIs were tested
over a wide concentration range (1­20µM) including their
near-Cmax values (RTV and LPV: 10µM; ATV: 4.4µM).
We initially selected two different concentrations of TEL
(1 and 5M) based on the previous literature;14,18 but for
further dose characterisation of TEL, we tested a range of
concentrations (0.5­20M). TEL was coincubated with
each of the PIs and added at the same time. ROSI (10M),
a PPAR agonist, was coincubated with LPV only in the
primary human adipocyte model as a comparator.
Measurement of cell viability.Viability of differentiating
3T3-F442A and primary human adipocytes was assessed
using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-
zolium bromide (MTT) assay. MTT measures mitochon-
drial metabolism as a surrogate marker of cell viability.19
The cells were incubated with the ARVs at serial concen-
trations (0.01­100µM) for 4days. On day 4, the cells were
incubated with MTT and the absorbance of the resultant
formazan product was measured at 560nm.

Lipid accumulation assay. Lipid accumulation in differenti-
ating adipocytes was assessed on day 10 (3T3-F442A
cells) or day 12 (primary human adipocytes) of differentia-
tion using Oil Red O (Sigma, Dorset, UK) as previously
described.14 Lipid-bound dye was extracted using 70%
isopropyl alcohol and staining was quantified at 520
nm.
The drug-treated cells were compared against the vehicle-
treated control (methanol).
RNA extraction and gene expression.Total RNA was iso-
lated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK).
Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan®
reverse transcription kit (Life Technologies Ltd). Gene
expression of PPAR and LPIN1 were assessed by real-
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TaqMan
Assays-on-Demand gene expression assays on a 7900HT
Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies Ltd).
Assessment of lipolysis. Free fatty acid concentration in the
conditioned media of primary human adipocytes was
determined using the Free Fatty Acid Quantification Assay
Kit as per manufacturer's instructions (Abcam). Briefly,
palmitic acid standard (1nmol/L) was used to prepare the
standard curve dilution; the reaction plates were prepared
and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30min
and the absorbance was measured using a microplate spec-
trophotometer (Beckman Coulter DTX880 Multimode
Detector) at 595nm.
Estimation of adipokines.Adipokine (adiponectin, IL-6,
resistin and TNF-) concentrations in the conditioned
media were determined on day 10 (3T3-F442A) or day 12
(primary human adipocytes) post differentiation using
bead-based Milliplex Mouse Sandwich Multiplex ELISA
kits (Merck Millipore) and Human Singleplex ELISA kits
(Life Technologies Ltd), respectively. The ELISA kits
used had the following detection limits: adiponectin,
5.2pg/mL (murine) and 100pg/mL (human); IL-6, 5.3pg/
mL (murine) and<1pg/mL (human); TNF-, 11.2pg/mL
(murine) and
<
2
pg/mL (human) and resistin, 6.1
pg/mL
(murine) and 10pg/mL (human).
Estimation of phosphorylated Akt content.Phosphorylated
Akt (serine residue 473) as well as total Akt was quanti-
tated by a sandwich ELISA, as recommended by the man-
ufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, the diluted
lysates were applied to 96-well plates containing immobi-
lised monoclonal antibodies specific for human Akt and
incubated for 2h at room temperature. A pS473 Akt stand-
ard and the samples were pipetted into the wells, followed
by washing and incubation with a rabbit antibody (Cell
Signalling, MA, USA) specific for AKT phosphorylated at
serine 473. Following washing, a horseradish peroxidase-
labelled anti-rabbit IgG was added and washed; a substrate
solution [3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)] was
added to produce colour and the absorbance was read at
450nm.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean±standard deviation (SD) for
at least three independent experiments to ensure repro-
ducibility. Statistical significance was determined using
the non-parametric Mann­Whitney U test (IBM SPSS
Statistics, version 22). The threshold of significance was
set at p<0.05.
Results
ARVs cause adipocyte cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity was observed with all ARVs during differen-
tiation of preadipocytes and followed a similar trend in
both 3T3-F442A and primary human cells. In differentiat-
ing 3T3-F442A adipocytes, the rank order for cytotoxicity
was LPV (IC50
=14µM)>RTV (IC50
=48µM)>ATV

TEL reverses ARV-induced inhibition in
adipocyte lipid accumulation
In 3T3-F442A adipocytes, a dose-dependent reduction in
lipid accumulation was observed for LPV (at 20
µM, a
reduction of 32% in mean absorbance, p<0.01) and RTV
(at 20
µM, 44% reduction, p<
0.01) but not for ATV [at
20µM, 4% increase, non-significant (NS)] in comparison
with the vehicle-treated controls (Figure 2(a); full concen-
tration response data are given in Supplementary
Information); 1
µM TEL partially reversed (p=0.01) the
RTV- and LPV-induced reduction in lipid accumulation in
3T3-F442A adipocytes (Figure 2(a)).
In primary human adipocytes, LPV and RTV (40%
and 55% decrease, respectively, in comparison with the
vehicle-treated control, p<
0.01) but not ATV (9%
increase; NS) inhibited lipid accumulation (Figure 2(b)).
Both TEL (5
µM) and ROSI (10
µM) reversed (p<0.01)
the ARV-induced inhibition of lipid accumulation partially
in primary human adipocytes (Figure 2(b)). The effect
shown by ROSI was stronger than that by TEL.
TEL reverses ARV-induced downregulation of
PPAR and LPIN1 gene expression
PPAR.In 3T3-F442A adipocytes, both LPV and RTV
(75% and 73% downregulation, respectively, p<0.01),
but not ATV, downregulated PPAR gene expression in
comparison with the vehicle-treated control. This was par-
tially but significantly reversed by 1µM TEL (Figure 3(a)).
A similar result was observed in primary human adipo-
cytes (LPV and RTV with 78% and 80% downregulation,
respectively) which was partially reversed by 5
µM TEL
(LPV+TEL, p=0.03; RTV+TEL, p=0.01; Figure 3(b)).
LPIN1.Both LPV and RTV downregulated LPIN1 gene
expression in both 3T3-F442A adipocytes (LPV, 64%;
RTV, 78%, p<0.01; Figure 3(c)) and primary human adi-
pocytes (LPV, 68%; RTV, 63%, p<0.01; Figure 3(d)). In
both models, this was partially reversed by 1 (3T3-F442A)
or 5µM (primary human adipocytes) TEL (Figure 3(c) and
(d)). ATV did not have any effect on LPIN1 expression.
TEL reverses ARV-induced changes in adipokine
secretion
Adiponectin. In 3T3-F442A adipocytes, both LPV (4.0ng/
mL±0.4; p
=
0.002) and RTV (7.0
±1.0; p=0.001) but
not ATV (14.2
±
2.4) caused downregulation in secreted
adiponectin protein in comparison to the vehicle-treated
control (16.5
±
2.0; Figure 4(a)). 1
µM TEL resulted in a
significant but partial reversal of PI-induced downregula-
tion of adiponectin (Figure 4(a)). A similar result was
observed in primary human adipocytes (LPV, 88% reduc-
tion, p=0.01; RTV, 73% reduction, p=0.01; ATV, 7.5%
reduction, NS); both TEL (5µM) and ROSI (10µM) were
able to significantly reverse PI-induced downregulation of
adiponectin (Figure 4(b)).
IL-6.Both LPV and RTV but not ATV increased the
secretion of IL-6 in 3T3-F442A adipocytes (LPV, 190ng/
mL±11.3; RTV, 243±7.9; both p<0.01;ATV: 55±8.0,
NS) in comparison to the vehicle-treated control (45±7.1;
Figure 4(c)). A similar effect was also observed in primary
human adipocytes for these PIs (LPV: 278% increase;
RTV: 316% increase; both p<0.01; Figure 4(d)). In both
in vitro models, coincubation with TEL partially reversed
PI-induced upregulation of secreted IL-6 (Figure 4(c)
and (d)).

TNF-. LPV (3T3-F442A, 45pg/mL±2.1; primary human
adipocytes, 62pg/mL±4.2, both p<
0.001) and RTV
(3T3-F442A, 57
±
5.0; primary human adipocytes,
78±5.7, both p<
0.01) but not ATV (3T3-F442A,
30±

lated secreted TNF- in comparison to the vehicle-treated
control (3T3-F442A, 32±4.3, and primary human adipo-
cytes, 40
±
5.0; Figure 4(e) and (f)). Coincubation with
either 1 (3T3-F442A) or 5µM TEL (primary human adipo-
cytes) or 10
µM ROSI (primary human adipocytes only)
significantly reversed PI-induced upregulation of TNF-.
Resistin.
All three PIs downregulated resistin in both
murine (LPV: 74% decrease; RTV: 73% decrease; ATV:
57% decrease; all in comparison to vehicle-treated control;
p<
0.01; Figure 4(g)) and primary human adipocytes
(LPV and RTV: 65% decrease; ATV: 48% decrease; all in
comparison to vehicle-treated control; p<0.01; Figure
4(h)). Both TEL and ROSI (in primary human adipocytes
only) showed a trend to reverse the PI-induced downregu-
lation of resistin, but this was not significant in either of
these models (Figure 4(g) and (h)).
TEL reverses ARV-induced adipocyte lipolysis
and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in primary
human adipocytes
Both LPV (90% increase; p<
0.03) and RTV (109%
increase; p<0.01) but not ATV (23%; p=NS) resulted in
an increase in free fatty acid levels in the conditioned
media in primary human adipocytes suggesting enhanced
lipolysis by these drugs (Figure 5(a)). Coincubation
with 5µM TEL reduced PI-induced lipolysis although the
effect was statistically NS. However, 10
µM ROSI
showed a significant partial reversal of ARV-induced
lipolysis.
A significant reduction in the expression of pAktSer473
was observed with LPV (at 20
µM, 63% reduction,
p<
0.01) and RTV (at 20
µM, 61% reduction; p<0.01),
but not with ATV, in comparison with the vehicle-treated
controls (Figure 5(b)). Both LPV and RTV reduced pAkt-
Ser473
expression in a dose-dependent manner (see
Supplementary Information). Coincubation with 5
µM
TEL or 10
µM ROSI significantly reversed PI-induced
downregulation of pAktSer473
(Figure 5(b)).

Characterisation of optimal TEL dose to elicit
metabolic effect
Using secreted adiponectin and PPAR gene as the exem-
plar markers, we evaluated the concentration­response
relationship of TEL in the presence of LPV (20
µM) in
primary human adipocytes. TEL significantly reversed
LPV-induced inhibition of adiponectin at 1, 5 and 10µM
concentrations; for PPAR, the effect of TEL was
observed at 5 and 10
µM only. Importantly, in both
instances, the maximal response for TEL was observed at
5µM with TEL showing a non-monotonic dose response
(Figure 6(a) and (b)).
Discussion
We have confirmed the previously reported toxic effect
of PIs on adipocytes and also identified how PIs affect
novel adipokines such as LPIN1 and resistin. We also
found that TEL results in a partial but significant reversal
of ARV-induced adipocyte toxicity and, for the first time,
characterised the concentration of TEL that elicits the
maximal metabolic effect in vitro. We used 3T3-F442A
cells as they are one of the most widely used in vitro
models to study adipogenesis and are committed to dif-
ferentiating into adipocytes.20 They have also been shown
to develop a homogeneous population of mature adipo-
cytes that are morphologically and biochemically similar
to adipocytes in situ.20 The chronic drug treatment design
enabled repeated drug exposure to the adipocytes over
the entire period of adipocyte differentiation; this mim-
icked the in vivo situation where the long-term ARV drug
treatment may result in cumulative adipocyte toxicity.21
LPV and RTV were toxic to adipocytes in both in vitro
models, while ATV, a more lipid-friendly PI,22 was not,
suggesting that the accumulation of certain ARVs over
time may reduce cell viability in differentiating adipo-
cyte populations in vivo and potentially deleteriously
affect the fat cell turnover and thereby adipose tissue
distribution.
Both LPV and RTV decreased lipid accumulation and
messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the adipogenic
markers, PPAR and LPIN1, consistent with their anti-
adipogenic effects. By contrast, ATV did not show any

effect on any of the above markers of lipid metabolism
even at a concentration of 20µM (>4times its Cmax value
of 4.4µM). The contrasting effects of ATV support clinical
data,22 which show that ATV has very little effect on body
fat distribution in HIV patients. This is the first study to
report an effect of PIs on LPIN1, a gene that encodes a
magnesium-ion-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohy-
drolase enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis23 and a
key factor in the maturation and maintenance of adipocyte
differentiation.24 LPIN1 is also a key transcriptional
regulator of PPAR and various genes involved in lipid
metabolism.25 Interestingly, LPIN1 mutations cause differ-
ent types of severe human lipodystrophy syndromes26
although our previous work has failed to identify any asso-
ciation between LPIN1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
and HIV lipodystrophy (HIVLD).27 The inhibitory effect
of lipotoxic PIs on LPIN1 could potentially be one of the
mechanisms involved in the transcriptional downregula-
tion of PPAR caused by these drugs.
LPV and RTV had a profound effect on the secretory
characteristics of the adipocyte regardless of the model
used. Our results on adiponectin, IL-6 and TNF- further
highlight how certain PIs may interact with the adipokine
network and regulate their transcription leading to adipo-
cyte dysfunction and interference with insulin signalling.
In addition, LPV and RTV but not ATV showed a signifi-
cant reduction in the expression of phosphorylated form
of Akt (Ser473); Akt is a serine/threonine kinase and a
downstream target of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
signalling, and phosphorylation of its serine residue at
position 473 is an important step in the insulin signalling
pathway.28
This study also explored the effects of PIs on resistin,
an adipocyte-secreted protein which is implicated in IR.
While higher circulating levels of resistin have been impli-
cated in the development of IR29 and diabetes,30 its role in
HIVLD is inconclusive. Some cross-sectional studies have
reported an increase in circulating resistin levels in HIVLD
patients,31 while other studies failed to find an association32
or even reported a reduction in resistin levels.33 We
observed a significant reduction in the amount of resistin
secreted by the adipocyte with all PIs including ATV
although the ATV effect was comparatively less than those
of other PIs. If resistin was involved in IR or adipocyte
dysfunction, we would have expected its level to increase;
our results suggest that secreted resistin might not be con-
tributing directly to IR or adipocyte dysfunction in this
ARV-treated cellular model. Previous clinical studies have
reported a decrease in plasma resistin with TEL in diabetes
patients;34 however, neither TEL nor ROSI had any effect
on resistin in these in vitro models. It should be noted that
in humans, resistin is primarily produced by cell popula-
tions other than adipocytes,35 including peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, macrophages and bone marrow cells.
This could potentially explain the discrepancy in resistin
levels between clinical and in vitro studies.
TEL is widely used as an antihypertensive because of
its ability to antagonise the effect of angiotensin II.
However, TEL is highly lipophilic, and it has been sug-
gested that its off-target effect on PPAR could be benefi-
cial in the treatment of metabolic disease and CVD.36­38 In
this study, TEL was able to partially reverse the PI-induced
inhibition in adipogenesis (lipid accumulation, expression
of PPAR and LPIN1), improve PI-induced reduction in
adiponectin and expression of pAktSer473
(effect on insulin
sensitivity), and reverse PI-induced upregulation in the
secretion of proinflammatory markers, IL-6 and TNF-. A
previous in vitro study had shown that TEL improves adi-
pocyte function following incubation with ARVs through
blockade of the adipose RAS.14 It should be noted that
PPAR is also a modulator of adipocyte RAS and activa-
tion of PPAR using full/partial agonists like ROSI or TEL
could potentially counter the effects of RAS. By testing a
wide range of concentrations of TEL (0.5­20M) on two
exemplar markers, PPAR gene and adiponectin protein,
we observed TEL to show a non-monotonic response with
the maximal effect observed at 5M in the primary human
adipocyte model. This dose response shown by TEL here
is different to that seen on blood pressure, which is linear
and mediated by the angiotensin receptor, AT1R. It might
very well be that both RAS and PPAR play an independ-
ent role in the development of PI-induced adipocyte dys-
function; given that PPAR full agonists such as ROSI
suffer from serious adverse effects, ARBs such as TEL
with dual activity on both PPAR and RAS may offer an
opportunity to reduce PI-induced toxicity.
Limitations of the study
This study has not investigated the effect of ARVs (with/
without TEL) in mature adipocytes; of course, the adipo-
cyte population in vivo is a mixture of differentiating and
differentiated adipocytes, but we felt it was important to
focus on differentiating adipocytes, as harmful effects
here would ultimately affect the population of differenti-
ated adipocytes. This study did not assess the effect of PI
drug combinations as used in the clinic; relating the con-
centration­response relationships in vitro to the in vivo
situation is challenging because of differences that can
occur in protein binding and drug distribution. It should
be noted that we have only used three replicates (biologi-
cal replicates) for each experiment in this study, but there
was a high degree of reproducibility within the experi-
ments. Taken together, our findings support the beneficial
metabolic effects observed with TEL and open up the
intriguing possibility that TEL could be used to prevent the
increase in IR that is seen in HIV-infected individuals
treated with ARVs.

Conclusion
This study has shown that TEL has beneficial metabolic
effects on adipocytes when given in combination with PIs
and therefore has the potential to reverse adipocyte toxic-
ity and IR mediated by PIs. The study also, for the first
time, has characterised the dose response of TEL in human
primary adipocytes. These in vitro findings now need to be
validated in a clinical study which preferably not only
evaluates, in a randomised fashion, the ability of TEL to
reduce IR in vivo, but also identifies the optimal dose. This
is currently being pursued in a phase IIb adaptive design
clinical trial.39
