Abstract
Background: Thrombocytopenia is associated with the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and anti-
viral therapy. Recent, national estimates of the clinical burden of thrombocytopenia among HCV-infected
individuals in the United States are unavailable. Bi-yearly data from the 1999-2000 to 2007-2008 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were used to examine the prevalence of thrombocytopenia among
HCV-infected individuals in the United States.
Results: Among 467 HCV-infected individuals in the survey (weighted population = 3,597,039), mean weighted age
was 46.7 years (standard deviation = 15.5) and 61.7% were male. Overall, 7.6% met the study definition of TCP at
the 150 × 109/L threshold; 4.5%, 2.0%, and 0.8% had platelet counts below 125, 100, and 75 × 109/L, respectively.
The 2-year weighted prevalences of thrombocytopenia (150 × 109/L threshold) from 1999-2008 were 4.9%, 8.6%,
6.5%, 4.1%, and 12.9%. The unadjusted biannual time trend (odds ratio) was 1.16 (95% confidence interval = 0.82-
1.64). In the two adjusted models, the odds by time ranged from 1.24-1.40, depending on whether the model
included demographic or laboratory variables or both, but did not reach statistical significance. Age was positively
and significantly related to thrombocytopenia status.
Conclusions: As the HCV-infected population ages, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia is expected to rise. This
study provides limited evidence of such an effect at the national level.

Background
Thrombocytopenia, which may be defined generally as a
platelet count below 150 × 109/L, is a common complica-
tion of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, particu-
larly among those with advanced liver disease, and those
receiving antiviral treatment for HCV [1-4]. Estimates of
the prevalence of thrombocytopenia in liver disease vary
widely, depending on the population and the platelet
threshold used [5,6]. Among studies of chronic liver disease
patients where thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet
count less than 150 × 109/L, prevalence estimates range
from 16-45% [6]. In clinical trials of interferon-based ther-
apy, more than one third of patients experienced a
decrease in platelet counts, with counts falling below 50 ×
109/L observed in 4-8% of patients [7,8]. Thrombocytope-
nia while on antiviral therapy may lead to dose reductions,
interruption, or discontinuations of interferon, potentially
jeopardizing the chances of achieving sustained virologic
response (SVR). In cases of portal hypertension and severe
thrombocytopenia, HCV patients may be unable to initiate
antiviral treatment due to low platelets.
An understanding of trends in the prevalence of HCV
and its complications facilitates public health planning and
treatment efforts. Although the current incidence of HCV
infection is low, the aging of individuals infected with
HCV over the past several decades suggests that the bur-
den of liver disease in the United States (US) will continue
to increase, with a peak in cirrhosis cases in the year 2020
preceding peaks in liver cancer in the following decade [9].
As that happens, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia

within the HCV-infected population also is likely to
increase. However, recent projections of HCV and liver
disease burden in the US have not considered the preva-
lence of thrombocytopenia [9-12]. Similarly, available esti-
mates of the future cost of HCV which are based on past
treatment patterns may not reflect adequately the addi-
tional cost associated with an increased prevalence of
thrombocytopenia.
The most recent examination of thrombocytopenia at
the national level was conducted using the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
III [13]. In that study, 13% of individuals with positive
HCV antibody had platelet counts below 175 × 109/L.
While NHANES III spans the period 1988-1994, it is
not possible to determine trends across that time period
due to the nature of data collection during that survey
phase. Newer administrations of NHANES, however, do
permit an examination of trends in the US over conse-
cutive, two-year periods. The objective of this study was
to document national trends over the past decade in the
prevalence of thrombocytopenia among individuals
infected with HCV, with the goal of informing efforts to
model the prevalence of complications associated with
chronic HCV infection.
Results
Across the 10-year study period, 467 NHANES partici-
pants were identified as having confirmed HCV infection;
platelet counts were available for 465 (99.6%). The raw
HCV frequency translates to an estimated prevalence in
the United States of 3,597,039 individuals (1.48% preva-
lence), including both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases of
infection. Weighted summary characteristics for HCV-
infected participants are shown in Table 1. Mean weighted
age was 46.7 years and 61.7% were male. Table 1 also sum-
marizes HCV-infected individuals with and without
thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count below 150 ×
109/L). Compared to those with normal platelet counts,
individuals with low platelet tended to be older (55.3 vs
46.0 years) and have higher ALT (81.5 vs 50.0), AST (84.6
vs 44.2), and iron (138.9 vs 106.9) levels, respectively (p <
0.05 for all comparisons). Questionnaire items tend to
have a large number of missing values, and a limited num-
ber of participants were eligible for certain examinations,
such as fasting glucose and fasting insulin; these items
should be interpreted with caution.
Figure 1 shows the 2-year point estimates and 95% con-
fidence intervals for the prevalence of thrombocytopenia
at the 150 × 109/L threshold from 1999-2008 for partici-
pants with and without confirmed HCV infection. Trends
for lower thresholds were unstable due to very small
sample sizes and are not shown. Among HCV-infected
individuals, the prevalence of thrombocytopenia at the
150 × 109/L threshold increased from 4.9% in 1999-2000
to 12.9% in 2007-2008, but first increased then decreased
from 2001-2006, although none of the periods showed a
statistically significant change from other periods. Trends
in thrombocytopenia prevalence among non-HCV-
infected individuals followed a similar pattern, although
at much lower levels. The rise in thrombocytopenia
prevalence of 8 percentage points among those with con-
firmed HCV infection represented a 164.0% increase but
did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, throm-
bocytopenia prevalence among non-HCV-infected indivi-
duals was relatively stable during the same time period,
increasing by less than 9%, from 1.4% to 1.6%.
Platelet counts among patients with HCV were signifi-
cantly correlated with several laboratory measures (data
not shown but available from the authors by request).
Those not correlated with platelets included protein, fast-
ing glucose, and fasting insulin, although the ability to
detect relationships to the fasting variables was hampered
by limited data availability. ALT and AST were signifi-
cantly correlated with bilirubin, protein, hemoglobin, iron,
and globulin. Of these, iron, protein, and globulin were
excluded from further analysis because they showed parti-
cularly strong correlations with ALT and AST.
Results for the three time-trend regression models are
shown in Table 2. The univariate, biannual time trend
(odds ratio) for platelets less than 150 × 109/L was 1.16
(95% CI = 0.82-1.64). The point estimate, which did not
reach statistical significance, can be interpreted as a bi-
yearly increase in thrombocytopenia prevalence of 16%.
In adjusted models, the odds by time increased to 1.24-
1.40, depending on whether the model included demo-
graphic or laboratory variables or both, but failed to
reach statistical significance. Age was positively asso-
ciated with an increase in the odds of thrombocytopenia
in both adjusted models. None of the laboratory
measures was significantly related to thrombocytopenia
status, although the coefficients were of the expected
sign. The presence of thrombocytopenia was not asso-
ciated with ALT or AST level.
Discussion
This study is the first to report trends in the prevalence
of thrombocytopenia across a national sample of indivi-
duals infected with HCV. For the most recent time per-
iod available, 2007-2008, the prevalence of platelets
below 150 × 109/L among HCV patients reached nearly
13%. Further, the prevalence over time among the non-
HCV-infected US population remained fairly stable.
While there was a dip in thrombocytopenia prevalence
for survey years 2005-2006, the presence of a similar dip
among the weighted population of all NHANES partici-
pants suggests that the decrease could be a function of
laboratory processing or some other systematic change
during that survey round.

A prior study utilizing NHANES III data for the years
1988-1994 found similar thrombocytopenia prevalence
among HCV-infected individuals. In that study, however, a
higher platelet threshold of 175 × 109/L-the bottom 5% of
platelet counts across all participants-was used [13]. If pla-
telet counts remained stable, then the prevalence estimates
from the current study, at a lower threshold, should have
been lower than in 1988-1994. We also found age to be
positively and significantly related to thrombocytopenia
status. Taken together, these two studies suggest that the
prevalence of thrombocytopenia among individuals
infected with HCV likely increased-perhaps substantially-
over the past two decades. However, the spike in thrombo-
cytopenia prevalence among HCV-infected individuals
observed in 2007-2008 could be an outlier. Additional
years of data will be needed to delineate a clear trend.
Several previous studies have examined platelet counts
among HCV patient populations. Louie et al (2011) per-
formed a systematic review of those studies conducted in
populations of 50 or more confirmed HCV-infected
patients. Among the 9 studies which used a platelet
threshold of 150 × 109/L to define thrombocytopenia,
reported prevalence ranged from 16.0% to 41.0% [6]. The
much higher proportions reported in these studies com-
pared to the current analysis may be explained, in part, by
the inclusion in the present study of individuals with
undiagnosed HCV infection. Davis et al (2010) estimates
that approximately 70% of individuals infected with HCV
are unaware of their serostatus [9]. Among the 167
NHANES participants from 1999-2008 with confirmed
HCV infection who responded to a follow-up telephone
survey, 48.9% reported that they were previously unaware
of their serostatus. It is likely that a large proportion of
those patients have yet to exhibit symptoms of liver dis-
ease, and one would expect a lower prevalence of throm-
bocytopenia among such patients.
The use of NHANES presents both advantages and dis-
advantages for the examination of thrombocytopenia
among individuals infected with HCV. The primary advan-
tage of NHANES lies in its sampling strategy, which allows
for the examination of a nationally representative popula-
tion of individuals. Additionally, NHANES has been con-
ducted on a biennial basis since 1999, allowing for the
examination of disease trends over the past decade. The
present study examines two conditions of which patients
may be unaware. HCV infection may remain asympto-
matic for several decades, such that many individuals
infected with HCV are unaware of their status [9]. Simi-
larly, thrombocytopenia is a laboratory abnormality that
may not appear as a specific diagnosis in administrative
data and patients may or may not identify it as a (known)
medical condition. Claims data or self-reported surveys
thus would be inadequate to examine the prevalence of
thrombocytopenia within the HCV-infected population.
NHANES does present some limitations. Since HCV is
relatively uncommon among the general population,

sample sizes within each 2-year survey period are small,
limiting the ability to detect changes over time, particu-
larly for lower platelet counts which may be more rele-
vant to clinical practice. The small sample also
contributes to the volatility in the estimates; a difference
of just one or two cases could have a large impact on
the prevalence estimates. Further, some high-risk groups
such as the homeless and incarcerated individuals are
not represented. Because those groups have not been
adequately studied, it is not known whether the risk of
thrombocytopenia with such risk groups is higher or
lower than among the overall HCV patient population.
Finally, NHANES is a cross-sectional survey with limited
information about patients' medical histories, including
duration of HCV infection, liver disease status, treat-
ment history, and mode of transmission. Because
NHANES lacks this information, it is not possible to
model the relationship between chronic liver disease
and thrombocytopenia. In particular, duration of HCV
infection is an unobserved latent variable that may be
explaining part of the variation in thrombocytopenia
rates.
Davis et al (2010) predict that the prevalence of cirrho-
sis will peak in 2020 [9]. Previous investigators have sug-
gested that the future burden of liver disease is likely to
be reduced only through improvements in the effective-
ness of antiviral therapy and increases in the numbers of
patients receiving therapy [9-12,14,15]. The latter goal
could be positively affected through the use of emerging
treatments which may safely improve platelet counts
among HCV-infected patients [5,16]. One study has
shown that treatment for low platelets can improve the
ability of some patients to initiate antiviral treatment
[17], but further study is needed to see whether the use
of such therapies will help patients initiate, maintain, and
complete antiviral treatment. Moreover, non-peginter-
feron-based treatment strategies for chronic HCV infec-
tion, several of which are under investigation, may enable
more patients to initiate and complete anti-viral therapy
and have a higher likelihood of SVR [18].
Conclusions
Thrombocytopenia increases health costs [5,19] and may
interfere with the ability of some patients to initiate or tol-
erate antiviral therapy [1,2,17]. If the burden of HCV is to
be reduced, the clinical impact of thrombocytopenia in
HCV-related liver disease must be addressed. A substantial
proportion of HCV patients have low platelet counts, and
the prevalence of low platelets among individuals with
chronic liver disease is likely to increase through the com-
ing decade. Future efforts to estimate the human and eco-
nomic consequences of HCV infection should consider
the role of thrombocytopenia as both a clinical manifesta-
tion of disease and a possible barrier to treatment.
Methods

consists of an interview and comprehensive medical
examination of a nationally representative sample of
about 5,000 persons each year. The interview compo-
nent includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and
health-related questions. The examination component
consists of medical, dental, and physiological measure-
ments, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly
trained medical personnel. NHANES study participants
aged 6 years and older were eligible for hepatitis C anti-
body testing, which was repeated in duplicate for posi-
tive samples.
All participants with available information on hepatitis C
testing and evidence of confirmed infection (positive
Chiron RIBA 3.0 Strip Immunoblot Assay) were eligible
for inclusion in the current study [20]. NHANES partici-
pants also received a complete blood count with differen-
tial in whole blood, which included platelet count and
mean platelet volume, and a standard biochemistry profile.
Included in the latter were alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and asparate aminotransferase (AST). Self-reported
information about prescription drug use during the past
30 days and medical conditions were included in the ques-
tionnaire portion of the survey.
Study measures
The primary measure of interest for the study was throm-
bocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet
count below 150 × 109/L, although other thresholds were
examined. Laboratory and examination variables used to
assess the likelihood of thrombocytopenia included ALT,
AST, iron, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, albumin, creati-
nine, bilirubin, total protein, hemoglobin, white blood cell
count, and weight. Questionnaire variables included alco-
hol use, marijuana use, health care utilization over the past
12 months, and prior diagnosis of liver cancer. Demo-
graphic variables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
income.
Statistical analysis
Summary statistics for the variables noted above were
calculated for all confirmed HCV-infected NHANES
participants. The proportion of confirmed HCV-infected
participants meeting a threshold criterion for thrombo-
cytopenia was calculated for each 2-year survey period
and compared using Fisher's exact test. The proportion
of all NHANES participants with low platelets in each
period was provided as a comparison.
Trends over time were analyzed via a series of logistic
regression models to account for non-linear relationships
between variables. The dependent variable in each model
was a dichotomous marker of thrombocytopenia (yes/no)
for each subject. The initial model considered only time,
with each 2-year survey timeframe considered as one per-
iod. Subsequent models included time plus demographic
variables (Model 2) and time plus demographic variables
plus laboratory measures (Model 3). Pearson correlation
coefficients between laboratory measures were calculated.
Measures not significantly correlated with platelet counts
were excluded from the regression analysis to arrive at a
more parsimonious model. Similarly, laboratory measures
which were significantly and strongly correlated with ALT
and AST were excluded to avoid problems with multi-
colinearity and improve model fit. Strong correlations
were defined as correlation coefficients with absolute
values exceeding 0.20. Questionnaire items with low
response rates were not included due to missing data.
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported
for each model.
Summary statistics, prevalence estimates, and regres-
sion analyses were weighted to represent the US popula-
tion using survey weights provided by the National
Center for Health Statistics. All analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.2, with 2-sided tests of hypothesis.
P-values of 0.05 or lower were considered statistically
significant. The study was approved by the University of
Florida Institutional Review Board. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
