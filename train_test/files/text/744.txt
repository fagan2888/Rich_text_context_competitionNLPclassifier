injuries other than gunshot wounds

Abstract
Objective--To characterize non-fatal fire-
arm related injuries other than gunshot
wounds (non-GSWs) treated in hospital
emergency departments in the United
States that occur during routine gun han-
dling and recreational use as well as
violence related use of a firearm.
Methods--Cases were identified through
the National Electronic Injury Surveil-
lance System (NEISS). During the study
period, 1 January 1993 through 31 Decem-
ber 1996, NEISS consisted of a nationally
representative sample of 91 hospitals in
the United States having at least six beds
and providing 24 hour emergency serv-
ices.
Results--An estimated 65 374, or an aver-
age of 16 300 per year, non-fatal, non-
GSWs were treated in American hospital
emergency departments during the four
year study period. Fifty seven per cent of
all the non-fatal, non-GSWs were violence
related, most of which involved being
struck by a firearm. The majority of unin-
tentional non-fatal, non-GSWs were self
inflicted and occurred during routine gun
handling or recreational use of a firearm;
43% of these injuries resulted from gun
recoils.
Conclusions--Non-fatal, non-GSWs make
a notable contribution to the public health
burden of firearm related injuries. Fire-
arm related injury prevention programs
should focus on not only the reduction of
gunshot wounds but also the reduction of
unintentional and violence related non-
GSWs.

Fatal and non-fatal firearm related injuries
associated with gunshot wounds (GSWs) have
been extensively described in the medical
literature. Since 1993, both fatal and non-fatal
firearm related GSW injury rates have declined
substantially, possibly due to improved eco-
nomic conditions, the aging of the population,
and changes in legislation, sentencing, and law
enforcement practices.1­3 However, GSWs re-
main an important public health problem.
They were the second leading cause of injury
death (32 400 deaths) behind motor vehicle
traYc related death (42 500 deaths) in 1997.4
In addition, GSWs contributed an estimated
64 200 non-fatal injuries treated in hospital
emergency departments in the United States in
1997, about half of which required hospitaliza-
tion.3 4 Although suicides and homicides ac-
count for over 96% of all gunshot related
deaths, about 20% of gunshot related injuries
treated in hospital emergency departments in
the United States are unintentional.4­7
Preventable firearm related injuries other
than GSWs (subsequently referred to as "non-
GSWs") are also a public health concern. They
occur in a variety of circumstances, including
fights, arguments, routine gun handling (for
example, transporting, cleaning, repairing),
recreational gun use, and leisure time activities.
Findings from one study of violence related
injuries suggested that one out of five violence
related firearm injuries treated in American
hospital emergency departments is associated
with being struck by a gun.8 Only minimal data
on unintentional non-GSWs have been re-
ported in selected populations, such as those
occurring during hunting or target shooting,
cleaning and repairing firearms, playing with a
gun, or gun malfunction and mishandling.7 9­18
These studies focused mainly on the circum-
stances of unintentional firearm related injuries
and fatalities, most involving GSWs, and none
characterize non-fatal, non-GSWs in the con-
text of all firearm related injuries.
In this study, we examine non-fatal, non-
GSWs treated in hospital emergency depart-
ments in the United States. National estimates
are presented by demographic characteristics
of the injured person, type and location of
wounds, hospitalization status, activity at the
time of injury, mechanism of injury, and other
circumstances of the injury incident. Firearm
related injuries were defined as those associ-
ated with guns that use a powder charge to fire
a projectile. A non-GSW was defined as physi-
cal injury (bodily harm), self inflicted or
inflicted by another person, occurring (1) from
being struck by a firearm or objects dislodged
during discharge of a firearm, or (2) while
evading gunfire; for example, fracture of ankle
from falling while running from gunfire. These
injuries can be violence related (for example,
fractures from being purposely struck by a gun)
or unintentional (for example, lacerations from
gun recoil during recreational use). Fatal
firearm related injuries are not included in this
study because deaths associated with non-
GSWs cannot be identified in mortality data.
Methods
These data were from the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) operated
by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
NEISS consisted of a stratified probability
sample of 91 hospitals having 24 hour

emergency service and at least six beds. These
hospitals are categorized in four strata--small,
medium, large, and very large--based on the
annual number of emergency department
visits. Both rural and urban hospitals in all
geographic regions are represented. To obtain
national estimates, each firearm related case
was assigned a sample weight based on the
inverse of the probability of selection. National
estimates were then computed by summing the
sample weights within the population group or
characteristic of interest. The sampling frame,
data collection protocol, and sensitivity of
NEISS for identifying firearm related injuries
have been described elsewhere.19­21
This study primarily focuses on non-fatal,
non-GSW cases initially treated in NEISS hos-
pital emergency departments between 1 Janu-
ary 1993 and 31 December 1996. Injuries
associated with BB, pellet, and other air guns
were excluded. Patients discharged alive from
the NEISS hospital emergency department
were defined as having non-fatal injuries; this
definition is supported by previous studies that
suggest most firearm related deaths occur
before hospitalization.5
At each NEISS hospital, trained coders
reviewed hospital emergency department
records, emergency department logs, and
trauma registries to identify all firearm related
injuries.21­23 Coders then abstracted data on the
nature of the injury, characteristics of the
injured patient, and circumstances of the inci-
dent. Data were obtained on age, sex, and race,
primary body part aVected, diagnosis, disposi-
tion at discharge from the emergency depart-
ment, locale where injured, type of firearm
used, and person causing the injury. The coder
provided a short narrative about the injury
event as described in the medical record.
During the four year study period, 1961
non-fatal, non-GSW cases were treated in
NEISS hospital emergency departments.
Among these cases, we excluded 361 that
occurred during military training (for example,
injured during military activities, Reserved
OYcers' Training Corps, and rifle corps train-
ing). Most of the military related cases were
treated at the three military hospitals in
NEISS. Military training related injuries were
excluded because military personnel have a
much greater exposure to firearms during
training subjecting them to higher risk than the
general public. Non-military training related
cases (for example, assaults) treated at military
hospitals were included. Two additional cases
were excluded because patients sustained both
GSWs and non-GSWs. National estimates
were computed using weighted data for the
remaining 1598 non-fatal, non-GSW cases
treated in NEISS hospital emergency depart-
ments.
We constructed two additional variables--
mechanism of injury and activity at time of
injury--for this study. A coding scheme (avail-
able upon request) was developed to categorize
cases by mechanism of injury and activity at
time of injury using information in the
narratives. The coding procedures were pilot
tested on an independent sample of NEISS
non-GSW cases. Each case was assigned a
mechanism of injury and activity code by one
researcher. Then, using the protocol, a second
researcher systematically reviewed all narra-
tives and assigned codes to corroborate the
classification. Any discrepancies were dis-
cussed and the final decision agreed upon by
both researchers.
Mechanism-of-injury categories were mutu-
ally exclusive and reflected how the person was
injured. The coding scheme was modeled after
guidelines to assign the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases,9th Revision,Clinical Modifica-
tion (ICD-9-CM) external causes of injury
codes (E codes) as well as the "recommended
framework for presenting injury mortality
data".24 25 If more than one mechanism was
listed, the mechanism most consistent with the
listed diagnosis and type of injury was coded.
For instance, injuries resulting from being
struck by or striking against a stationary or
moving object included falling on a gun if the
gun itself caused the injury. Injuries coded into
the struck by/against category exclude those
sustained by falling or stumbling while carrying
a firearm, or by being struck by an explosive

blast. Injuries caused by contact with an edged,
pointed, or sharp part of the gun or by being
pinched between moving parts of the gun were
labeled "cut/crush" injuries. Mechanisms of
injury classified in the "other" category include
injuries caused by falls, burns, mechanical
force, acoustic energy, and other less frequent
mechanisms. Activity-at-time-of-injury catego-
ries were mutually exclusive. If more than one
activity was reported, the case was assigned the
category listed first in the narrative.
National estimates of the number of injuries,
injury rates, and 95% confidence intervals are
presented. Injury rates per 100 000 population
were annualized and calculated by using
1993­96 postcensal population estimates from
the United States Bureau of Census.25 Confi-
dence intervals for numbers and rates and rela-
tive standard error (SE) or coeYcients of vari-
ation were computed by using a program that
accounts for the stratified sample design and
sample weights.20 National estimates based on
weighted data for fewer than 25 cases or that
had a relative SE (or coeYcient of variation)
more than 28% are unreliable and are foot-
noted in tables. This work was exempt from
institutional review board approval.
Results
During the study period, an estimated 413 186
non-fatal firearm injuries were treated in emer-
gency departments in the United States (fig 1).
Of these injuries, 84.2% (347 615) were attrib-
uted to GSWs and 15.8% (65 374) were asso-
ciated with firearm related non-GSWs. GSWs
were predominantly violence related (70%),
including assault, legal intervention, and sui-
cide attempts.
Table 1 shows the majority of the non-GSWs
were assaults (56.6%; 36 980 injuries) and
unintentional injuries (41.4%; 27 060 inju-
ries). The rate for males was 4.3 times that for
females. This diVerence was consistent for
unintentional injuries and assaults. With regard
to race/ethnicity categories, black people had
the highest rate for assaults while non-Hispanic
whites had the highest rate for unintentional
injuries. The non-GSW rate was highest
among persons 15­24 years old.
The nature of injury and characteristics of
the injury incident for those with non-GSWs
appear in table 2. The primary body part

aVected was the head, face, and neck region.
Four out of five of the assault injuries were to
the head, face, or neck. The majority of injuries
treated were lacerations. However, lacerations
accounted for a higher percentage of uninten-
tional than assault related injuries (63% v 49%,
p<0.0001, respectively). Contusions and abra-
sions accounted for a higher percentage of
assault related than unintentional injuries
(22.2% v 13.0%, p<0.0001, respectively).
About 3% (or 1897 injuries) of non-fatal, non-
GSWs were severe enough to require hospitali-
zation, of which 71% involved the head and
neck region. The locale where the injury
occurred was determined for only about half of
the cases, most occurring in or around the
home. The type of firearm used was unknown
in more than a third of the cases; of the known
firearm types, 34.5% were handguns. More
than 60% of the unintentional injuries were
associated with, or involved rifles and shotguns,
while half of assault related injuries were asso-
ciated with or involved handguns. The majority
of unintentional injuries were self inflicted. The
person causing the injury could not be
determined in 45% of assault related cases; in
cases with known perpetrators, injuries in-
flicted by a stranger was the most common.
The activity at time of injury and mechanism
of injury are described in table 3. Activity was
determined for over 90% of unintentional
injury cases but only for about 25% of assault
related cases. More than half of unintentional
injuries occurred during cleaning, repairing,
loading/unloading, or transporting a firearm
and an additional one fourth occurred during
recreational activities, such as hunting and tar-
get shooting. For those assault related cases
with known activity, about 20% occurred while
the victim was engaged in vital, travel, or leisure
activities. For example, some were inadvert-
ently caught in the line of gunfire and were
struck by ricocheting debris or broken glass;
others fell down while attempting to evade
gunfire.
The mechanism of injury was determined in
most cases. For assaults, the predominant
mechanism was being struck by a moving gun,
frequently called a pistol whipping (82.5%;
30 521 injuries). For unintentional injuries, the
most common mechanism was gun recoil
(43.2%; 11 686 injuries), followed by cutting,
piercing, crushing, and pinching injuries asso-
ciated with the slide or trigger mechanism or
other gun part. Six per cent of unintentional
injuries resulted from mechanical force related
to an explosion of gun parts. Other uninten-
tional injuries included powder burns, burns
from contact with hot shell casings, auditory
trauma from excessive noise exposure, and falls
while carrying a firearm.
Over the four year study period, 6871
persons with recreational non-GSWs were
treated in hospital emergency departments in
the United States (table 4). Persons treated for
these injuries were primarily male and over 15
years of age. Nearly two thirds of the injuries
were to the head, face, neck and eye, and most
of the others were to the extremities. Rifles and
shotguns accounted for nearly two thirds of
these injuries. Recreational non-GSWs were
primarily associated with hunting (55.2%;
3792 injuries) and target shooting (44.3%;
3043 injuries). Almost half of the recreational
injuries (3209 injuries) were caused by gun
recoil, and nearly eight out of 10 occurred dur-
ing the fall and winter.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this report provides the first
national estimates of non-fatal, non-GSWs
treated in hospital emergency departments
pertaining to non-military, civilian life. During
the four year period 1993 through 1996, we
estimated that 16 344 non-fatal, non-GSWs
were treated in American emergency depart-
ments annually. During this same period, an
estimated 86 904 non-fatal GSWs were treated
each year in the same hospitals. In addition, an
average of 37 024 persons were killed by GSWs
annually from 1993 through 1996.4 These data
show that non-fatal, non-GSWs contribute
markedly to the total numbers of firearm
related injuries in the United States each year.
Population subgroups at highest risk for sus-
taining non-fatal, non-GSWs are very similar
to those at highest risk for fatal and non-fatal
GSWs injuries. The non-fatal and fatal firearm
related injury rates for males is about six to
seven times higher than that for females.2­8 Our
results show that the rate of non-fatal,
non-GSWs for males was more than four times
that for females. The age distribution for non-
fatal, non-GSWs also follows the distribution
of fatal and non-fatal GSWs. People aged
15­34 years account for the largest number of
firearm related injuries and deaths, over 70% of
non-fatal GSWs and 47.5% of fatal GSWs.4 5
In our study, 60% of the non-fatal, non-GSWs
were among persons 15­34 years old.
Regarding racial and ethnic disparity, our
results suggest that the racial disparity among
non-fatal and fatal GSW injuries extends to
non-fatal, non-GSWs injuries. The rate of
non-fatal, non-GSWs among black people was
approximately three times the rate for non-
Hispanic whites. In 1996, the fatal firearm
related injury rate for the black population was
2.7 times that of the white population.4 Annest
et al reported that the non-fatal GSW rate
among blacks was over nine times the rate
among non-Hispanic whites and three times
the rate among Hispanics.5 Our estimates show
that among assault related non-GSW injuries
for blacks, the rate was eight times the rate for
non-Hispanic whites.
Implications for prevention
In this study, national estimates indicate that
97% of non-fatal, non-GSWs treated in hospi-
tal emergency departments in the United
States during the study period were not hospi-
talized. However, non-GSWs, such as struck by
a gun in the head, that are not severe enough to
require hospitalization may result in perma-
nent or residual disability.26 27 Mild traumatic
brain injuries may lead to long term, potentially
permanent residual symptoms such as head-
aches, irritability, anxiety, dizziness, fatigue,
impaired concentration, memory loss, and
information processing deficits.28­35 Almost
2400 non-GSW related eye injuries were
treated in hospital emergency departments
over the four year study period. Sixty seven per
cent of these injuries were unintentional, most
of which occurred during routine gun handling
(63.7%) or recreational (26%) activities. Fire-
arm related eye injuries, including corneal
abrasions, lacerations, orbital lacerations, and
enucleation are often severe enough to require
surgery and may result in permanent visual
acuity loss.13 36­39 These injuries might be
prevented through proper use of safety glasses
and proper gun handling techniques. Even
though head, face, and eye injuries may result
in significant disability, no mechanism cur-
rently exists to monitor firearm related injury
disability nationally.40
Recreational gun users need to understand
their risk of non-GSWs during gun use.
Non-GSWs severe enough to require emer-
gency medical attention can occur, including
lacerations, contusions/abrasions, and frac-
tures. Almost 92% of unintentional non-fatal,
non-GSWs were self inflicted. A majority
(55%) of unintentional non-fatal, non-GSWs
occurred during activities such as cleaning,
repairing, and handling firearms. These activi-
ties have also been associated with uninten-
tional GSWs.9 Twenty five per cent of an
estimated 6871 unintentional injuries occurred
during recreational gun use, including hunting
(55.2%) and target shooting (44.3%). For
cases where the type of firearm was known,
rifles (33.2%) and shotguns (27.9%) were the
most frequent type of firearm responsible for
unintentional recreational injuries. This find-
ing is consistent with other reports of hunting
related injuries and deaths.9 17
Self inflicted recreational firearm injuries
have high potential for prevention. Gun safety
and firearm education programs should be
directed towards recreational gun users, in-
cluding hunters and target shooters. In this
study, just over three quarters of recreational
non-GSWs occurred during the fall. Emphasiz-
ing firearm safety messages during the late
summer and early fall may remind hunters and
target shooters to be cautious when engaging in
gun related activities.
Among recreational non-GSWs, 43% were
caused by gun recoil. Instructing novice gun
users in the proper positioning of the gun stock
on the shoulder can help to control the power-
ful "kickback" associated with discharge of a
firearm thereby limiting recoil related injuries.
Improving firearm design, such as incorporat-
ing cushioned gun stocks or padded shoulder
holsters, may also help reduce recoil related
injuries. Designing rifle scopes with padded
and rounded edges could decrease chance of
lacerations around the eye.
LIMITATIONS
We estimated that 7630 persons purposely
struck by a gun were treated in American hos-
pital emergency departments annually. This
estimate is half the estimate of 15 300 reported
by Rand in a study of all intentional injuries in
1994.8 The diVerence in these estimates could
be explained by two factors. First, his estimate
of being struck by a gun has a large sampling
error due to the small numbers of cases
reported in the study conducted at one third of
the 91 NEISS hospitals. Second, it is possible
that his coding scheme was more inclusive in
defining struck by a gun. Both studies,

however, indicate that those involved in policy
decisions and planning programs for gun
related violence prevention should be informed
not only about GSWs but also about the extent
of injuries from being struck by a gun.
NEISS is only appropriate for calculating
national estimates of firearm related injuries
and cannot be used to examine associations
with geographic location and urbanization.
Also, NEISS data on injury related circum-
stances are abstracted from emergency depart-
ment records. Since medical personnel prima-
rily are focused on treating the patient, medical
records often lack suYcient information to
describe injury related circumstances. For
instance, guns are used in about 30% of
weapon related assaults.41 We were only able to
classify the context (for example, robbery, bur-
glary, sexual assault) in 38.3% of assaults. Also,
we had diYculty identifying the locale of the
assault related incident (48% unknown), the
type of firearm (34% unknown), the victim-
oVender relationship (45% unknown) and
activity at the time of injury (74% unknown).
To improve reporting of these characteristics,
NEISS data could be linked to other data
sources. Law enforcement and medical
examiner/coroner reports have been identified
as providing the most comprehensive incident
information on firearm fatalities; law enforce-
ment and crime lab reports could be a potential
information source for investigating non-fatal
firearm injuries.42 43
NEISS collects data on firearm related inju-
ries treated in hospital emergency depart-
ments. As a result, this report may underesti-
mate the number of non-fatal, non-GSWs
because common types of non-GSWs, such as
contusions, lacerations and burns, may have
been treated in medical facilities other than
hospital emergency departments or may not
have required treatment by a medical profes-
sional. NEISS does provide a sensitive estimate
of the number of non-fatal firearm injuries.19
An evaluation of NEISS found that hospital
coders correctly identified 92.4% of GSWs
treated in a random sample of NEISS hospital
emergency departments.18 Although non-
GSWs were not included in that evaluation
study, coders were instructed to report all gun
related incidents described in the emergency
department record. We have no reason to sus-
pect NEISS is any less sensitive for non-GSWs.
In summary, non-fatal, non-GSWs make an
important contribution to the overall public
health burden of fatal and non-fatal firearm
related injuries in the United States and aVect
blacks disproportionately. Over half (58%) of
such injuries were violence related. Injuries
from being purposely struck by a gun should be
considered when developing gun violence pre-
vention programs at national, state, and local
levels. Most of the remaining non-fatal, non-
GSWs were unintentional (41.4%), which were
predominantly self inflicted (92%) and pre-
ventable. Further research is needed to identify
and characterize gun users at greatest risk of
sustaining these types of injuries and to exam-
ine associations between injury events and fire-
arm design and safety features. EVorts should
be made in state and local jurisdictions to
design eVective prevention strategies and to
facilitate the availability of proper training and
education in gun handling and gun safety prac-
tices for all gun owners and users to decrease
the risk of injury.

Million Mom March
In May approximately 750 000 moms (and many dads and others) marched to Washington to
press for sensible gun laws in the US. This was an impressive event and in spite of some trivial
counter demonstrations ("I am here to protect my God-given right to carry a gun", said one
opponent), may well have succeeded in getting the message across to the US Congress that the
time for fundamental changes had come.
Rational research spending?
Last year, an important report appeared in a leading international journal demonstrating that
"The amount of . . . funding for research on a disease is associated with the burden of the dis-
ease; however, diVerent measures of the burden . . . may yield diVerent conclusions about the
appropriateness of disease-specific funding levels". Indeed, they do. An inspection of the data
reveals that injury is perhaps the most underfunded of all and that various, "popular"
diseases--for example, AIDS, breast cancer, diabetes, and dementia are clearly over-funded (N
Engl J Med 1999;340:1881­7).
Editor's note: My apologies if I previously brought this report to our readers' attention.
"Accident" again!
In a book about an American couple (Native Speaker, by Chang-Rae Lee), whose son was
fatally injured, the author writes this bit of dialogue: "It was a terrible accident". The other
retorts, "An accident? . . .. How can you say it was an accident? We haven't treated it like one.
Not for a second. Look at us, Sweetie, can't you see, when your baby dies it's never an acci-
dent. I don't care if a truck hit him or he crawled out a window or he put a live wire in his
mouth, it was not an accident. And that's a word you and I have no business using" (p 120).
Editor's note: Thanks to Elisa Braver for bringing this to my attention.
Pro-car, antipedestrian rhetoric in the UK
A piece appeared in the Times (London) last fall that I dismissed after first reading it because
I assumed it was tongue-in-cheek, facetious. I then concluded that the writer, Jonathan
Meades, was perfectly serious. His extended tirade against the safety of pedestrians and pref-
erence for protecting the needs of motorists is summed up well by the following opening
quotes: "Our cities are being killed by pedestrian zones which benefit only tourists and crimi-
nals". "If God had meant us to walk he wouldn't have allowed us to invent the wheel". I hesi-
tated to report this, but think we need to appreciate what we are up against in our eVorts to
prevent pedestrian injuries.
Asbestos-containing crayons
Health Canada is inspecting crayons for asbestos after tests in the US found small amounts of
this carcinogen in three brands, including the most popular. Although the manufacturer dis-
putes the findings, Health Canada will conduct its own tests as a "precautionary" measure.
