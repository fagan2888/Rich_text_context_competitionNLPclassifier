Introduction
The type and level of parental/guardian involvement in their
children's schooling has often been posited as one of the
most important factors associated with educational success.
High levels of parental involvement have been linked with a
number of favorable outcomes including higher rates of
school attendance, more support for home learning, greater
communication with the school or education provider, and
higher levels of social adjustment and academic achievement
(Berthelsen & Walker, 2008; Clark, 2007; Moon & Ivins,
2004). Clark (2009) adds to this list the development of
greater cognitive competence among learners, enhanced
problem-solving skills, and fewer learner behavioral prob-
lems at school. These potential benefits, moreover, are in
evidence across all levels of schooling and not just during the
early grades of a child's formal education.
Emerson, Fear, Fox, and Sanders (2012) state that paren-
tal involvement can be defined as the building of partner-
ships between families, schools, and communities that
increase parental awareness of the benefits of engaging with
their children's education while also developing the skills for
this to occur. Berthelsen and Walker (2008), offering an
overview of the work of scholars including Reynolds and
Clements (2005), Ho and Willms (1996), and Dimock,
O'Donoghue, and Robb (1996), maintain that parental
involvement can be viewed in terms of parental behavior
toward, and expectations of, their children's schooling and
the actions they subsequently take in this regard either at the
school or at home. This perspective can be argued to encom-
pass such constructs as parents participating at their chil-
dren's schools, communicating with the school, discussing
with their children what they have done during school time,
and supervising schoolwork at home.
For Dimock etal. (1996), parental involvement may be
related to a number of dimensions including the choice of
schools that the parents make, their involvement in the for-
mal structures that influence school decision making, and in
teaching and learning either at the school or at home, com-
munication with teachers outside of formal meetings, and

Omani Parents' Involvement in Their
Children's English Education
Rahma Al-Mahrooqi1, Christopher Denman1,

Abstract
High levels of parental/guardian involvement in their children's education are often associated with a number of educational,
social, and even psychological benefits. These include higher rates of school attendance, greater communication with
the school or education provider, better social adjustment, and higher levels of academic achievement including in the
development of literacy skills. However, despite this, research from the Arab world on the relationship between parental
involvement and children's development of English language literacy skills has tended to report mixed results, with this also
being the case in the Sultanate of Oman. To explore this issue within the Omani context, the current study examined the
potential benefits, challenges, and practices of Omani parents as these relate to their children's English language studies. A
two-section Likert-type response scale questionnaire was administered to 391 parents of students in the country's public
school system. The first questionnaire section related to participants' attitudes about parental involvement in their children's
English studies while the second explored the frequency with which parents engaged in activities related to their children's
English classes. Results indicate that Omani parents are generally aware of the importance of their involvement in their
children's development and believe that they should be involved in a number of home- and school-based activities. However,
despite this, their actual level of involvement in their children's English language studies was somewhat limited.

other forms of communication with the school. Although
there are many avenues through which parents can become
involved in their children's education, a number of scholars
have offered guiding principles to make this engagement
more effective.
Literature Review
Principles of Effective Parental Engagement
Emerson etal. (2012) offer several principles for effective
parental engagement in their children's schooling. The first
of these is academic socialization, which refers to those
parental behaviors that have a demonstrably positive influ-
ence on children's learning and academic outcomes. This is
naturally a very broad area, though the authors highlight how
the main aim of academic socialization is to develop learn-
ers' abilities over time to independently establish and assess
their goals, to take responsibility for their actions, and to
learn from both their successes and their failures. Emerson
et
al. claim that academic socialization can be achieved
through parents communicating expectations regarding edu-
cation to children, highlighting both the value and the enjoy-
ment that can be gained through learning, discussing relevant
learning strategies and styles, establishing a connection
between schoolwork and events happening in the child's
world, making the home learning environment stimulating,
encouraging children to develop educational goals and to
make preparations to meet those goals, and engaging in
activities that build their sense of autonomy and academic
capabilities.
Parental role construction, Emerson et
al. (2012) con-
tinue, refers to the role parents choose to play in their chil-
dren's education and is often closely linked with parental
beliefs about the efficacy of their involvement in this area. It
may be developed autonomously or through the school's
encouragement to participate, and is often considered one of
the most important factors linked to children's academic suc-
cess. The authors claim that this principle is influenced by a
number of factors, including parents'beliefs about what edu-
cational outcomes for their children are appropriate and
desirable, about who is responsible for helping their children
achieve these outcomes, and about what people, including
teachers, family members, and other parents, expect from
them as a parent.
The final principle of parental involvement Emerson etal.
(2012) offer is parenting style. This is an area associated with
both academic success and psychological well-being. For
example, the authors claim that parents who expect high lev-
els of academic achievement yet are emotionally distant may
actually cause their children to develop low self-esteem
which, in turn, leads to lower levels of academic achieve-
ment. However, parenting styles that encourage communica-
tion between parents and children, that set limits and rules
and seek to understand bad decisions, not only contribute to
higher levels of emotional well-being but also encourage the
development of a child's autonomy and sense of responsibil-
ity. These parenting styles can, therefore, contribute to aca-
demic achievement.
In addition to these principles, the Family-School and
Community Partnerships Bureau (2011) maintains that
parental involvement must be systemic, integrated, and sus-
tainable to have a positive impact on children's schooling.
That is, involvement should be systemic in that parental
engagement is seen by institutions as a core educational goal
due to its strong links with school readiness and academic
achievement. It must also be integrated into education struc-
tures and processes, including teaching and learning, com-
munity involvement, professional development, and issues
of evaluation and accountability. Finally, the author states
that parental engagement should be sustainable in that ade-
quate resources are provided for the implementation of strat-
egies to increase parental involvement that can positively
affect students' well-being and academic success.
Australia's Department of Education and Training (DET;
2001) offers a number of suggestions to put in place appro-
priate processes to ensure that parental involvement can
result in benefits for children, the school, and the wider com-
munity. These include
·
· Creating a profile of the families comprising the
school community;
·
· Developing 3-year plans for parent involvement;
·
· Identifying which school staff will be responsible for
fostering parental involvement;
·
· Regularly surveying parents to gauge their level of
satisfaction with their involvement and the processes
that support it;
·
· Holding training sessions for parents to inform them
of ways to be involved;
·
· Holding workshops that examine achievement with
parental involvement and look for ways to increase
that involvement in coming semesters/years.
While these ways of enhancing the effectiveness of paren-
tal involvement have been discussed in terms of their poten-
tial general benefits, research has also highlighted the links
between parental involvement in children's education and
the development of learners' literacy skills.
Parental Involvement and Literacy Skills
Clark (2009) claims that both mothers and fathers have an
important, if somewhat different, influence on the develop-
ment of their children's literacy skills. That is, although both
mothers and fathers generally interact with their children in
similar ways, Clark states that fathers often use more diffi-
cult vocabulary with their children such as more abstract
words. Moreover, mothers and fathers often employ different
vocabulary altogether and, therefore, between them, help
Al-Mahrooqi et al. 3
expose children to a wider range of words. For instance,
mothers often use language to describe emotions while
fathers are more prone to offer explanations. It is for these
reasons that the involvement of both parents in their chil-
dren's schooling can offer a number of benefits to the devel-
opment of their literacy skills.
Clark (2009) continues that, despite the potential benefits
associated with parental involvement as offered above, only
a handful of studies have explicitly examined the link
between this involvement and children's literacy develop-
ment. However, despite this, the author claims that a number
of scholars, such as Durkin (1966) and Lloyd (1999), have
suggested that higher levels of parental involvement in their
children's reading, including through spending time reading
with them, monitoring, and evaluating their reading, were
linked with higher levels of reading development. These
were trends that Clark highlighted in relation to the involve-
ment of fathers, although the author notes that children often
consider their mothers to be the ones who initially taught
them to read.
Clark (2007) maintains that, of all academic skills chil-
dren develop at school, it is actually reading that is the most
sensitive to issues of parental involvement. She states that
parental involvement with reading activities at home has an
important influence on reading achievement, in addition to
language comprehension, interest, and attitudes toward read-
ing and even on class attentiveness. Parental involvement in
this skill can take many forms, including promoting the value
of reading as a worthwhile and valuable activity while also
making available reading resources including books, maga-
zines, and newspapers, and reading to their children.
In terms of the link between parental involvement and
children's literacy development, the InternationalAssociation
for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA; 2014)
offers a direct correlation between the level of parental
involvement and student reading achievement. In an investi-
gation covering more than 50 education systems from around
the world, the IEA reports positive relationships between the
level of parental involvement and achievement on the
Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS)
reading test that was administered to samples of Grade 4 stu-
dents from around the world. The report features data from
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations of Oman,
Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Interestingly,
while this general trend of increased parental involvement
being associated with higher level reading skills on the
PIRLS holds true for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
Qatar, in Oman and Kuwait the results are mixed. That is, in
both countries medium levels of parental involvement are
linked with better reading test achievement scores than
higher levels of parental achievement. In addition, in Kuwait,
higher levels of parental involvement are associated with
lower reading levels.
Clark and Hawkins (2010) identify four main aspects of
parental involvement that contribute directly to children's
literacy development.The first is access to physical resources,
with the authors stating that children who have access to
their own books read more often and enjoy reading more
than those who do not. Moreover, having access to other
reading resources, such as newspapers and magazines, was
also correlated with higher levels of reading attainment.
Parental encouragement to read was another aspect of
involvement associated with learners' reading enjoyment
and attainment. Clark and Hawkins state that children who
get a lot of encouragement to read from their parents tend to
report enjoying reading more and also to read more outside
of class than those who do not. They also hold more positive
attitudes toward reading and performed better than expected
for their age on reading attainment tests. An almost identical
pattern of increased enjoyment, better attitudes, and height-
ened reading attainment was also in evidence in relation to
children who often saw their parents reading.
The final aspect of parental involvement in their chil-
dren's schooling identified by Clark and Hawkins (2010) as
contributing to the development of literacy skills is talking
about what children are reading. Clark and Hawkins found
that young people who talk about what they are reading with
their parents everyday generally enjoy reading much more
than those who never discuss this part of their education.
Moreover, children who never talk about what they are read-
ing with their parents are more likely to believe that reading
is boring and tend to rarely read outside of the classroom.
These children are also more likely to score below the
expected level for their ages on reading achievement tests.
Factors Influencing Parental Involvement
A number of factors may be related to the level and type of
involvement parents have with their children's education.
Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995) acknowledge that a
model of parental involvement commonly assumed in the lit-
erature consists of two dominant contributing factors. The
first of these is parent factors, which include socio-
demographic variables and other, more dynamic, variables
including parental attitudes, and so on. The second contribut-
ing factor involves school variables, including those status
variables that characterize schools and more dynamic vari-
ables including teacher behaviors and so on. Hoover-
Dempsey and Sandler claim that this model, although widely
accepted, fails to take account of the reasons why parents
become involved in the education of their children and how
such involvement leads to positive educational outcomes.
In seeking to address these questions, Hoover-Dempsey
and Sandler (1995) offer what they describe as a causal and
specific model of parental involvement featuring five inter-
linked layers. The first layer is "parental involvement deci-
sion" and relates to those variables that influence the parents'
positive decision to become involved in their children's edu-
cation. Factors highlighted in the model include parents'
construction of the parental role and their sense of
4 SAGE Open
self-efficacy in helping their children succeed--both of
which are informed by such variables as parents'direct expe-
riences, emotional arousal, and the verbal persuasion they
encounter. Other important factors here include general
opportunities and demands for parental involvement as
expressed by their children and their children's schools.
These factors combine to influence the next layer of the
model: "parents' choice of involvement forms." This is an
area that is directly affected by a number of variables, such
as parents' specific skills and knowledge, the demands of
their families and jobs in terms of time and energy, and the
specific invitations and demands for involvement from chil-
dren, schools, and teachers.
The parents'choice of forms of involvement, according to
the model, then affects the next layer of "mechanisms
through which parent involvement influences child/student
outcomes." This is influenced by both closed- and open-
ended instruction, the modeling of school-related behaviors
and attitudes including asking questions about school,
reviewing homework, communicating with teachers, and
reinforcing specific aspects of school-related learning. This
layer, in turn, influences "tempering/mediating variables,"
which include the parents' use of involvement strategies that
are developmentally appropriate and the "fit" between school
expectations of parental involvement and parental involve-
ment actions. These mediating variables contribute to the
final layer of Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler's (1995) model:
"child/student outcomes." These outcomes encompass the
skills and knowledge that children develop at school due to
their parents' involvement and the sense of efficacy they
have for doing well in school.
Clark (2007) offers an adaptation of Hoover-Dempsey and
Sandler's (2005) model of the process of parental involve-
ment. In this model, the three main factors that contribute to
parental involvement are identified as parents' motivational
beliefs, parents' perceptions of invitation for involvement
from others, and parents' perceived life contexts. In relation
to the first factor, Clark states that "parents are at the most
fundamental level motivated to become involved by their
sense of self-efficacy" (p. 2), or their belief that their involve-
ment will have a positive impact on their children's academic
success. Perceptions of involvement relate to the belief that
the school, the teachers, and their children have expressed an
interest in involving parents in the education process and, in
this way, relate to the beliefs of organizations such as the
Family-School and Community Partnerships Bureau (2011)
and DET (2001) that school systems must be in place to make
parental involvement as smooth, active, and meaningful as
possible. The final factor offered by Clark as contributing to
parental involvement is that of perceived life context, which
relates to how parents' knowledge and skills, and the input
they believe the involvement requires in terms of time and
energy, is viewed by parents.
The models of parental involvement offered by Hoover-
Dempsey and Sandler (1995) and Clark (2007) highlighted
above feature a number of variables that may be influential
in determining the nature and level of involvement parents
choose to have in their children's education. With direct ref-
erence to parental involvement and the development of lit-
eracy skills, the IEA (2014) reports that, across the 50
educational systems examined around the world, those
schools that experienced higher rates of parental involve-
ment tended to have more students with parents who had a
university-level education, thereby suggesting a link between
involvement and socio-educational status. Interestingly, this
level of correlation holds true for the Arab Gulf nations and
emirates of Dubai and Saudi Arabia though becomes more
confused when examined in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Oman.
Clark (2009) examines the potential link between parental
involvement and socio-economic status and notes that a
number of researchers have suggested there is a positive link
between children's levels of literacy development and their
father's work literacy practices. Although the initial supposi-
tion here may be that children whose fathers engage in more
literacy practices at work are more involved in their chil-
dren's education and hence can exert more of a positive
influence in the area, Clark maintains that it may not be the
use of literacy skills at work by fathers itself that affects the
literacy development of children, but rather "the way in
which job-related literacy impacted on the home literacy
environment where children's development was being fos-
tered that made a difference" (p. 13). In either case, this
research implies that those fathers who have white-collar
jobs (and hence are often middle class and/or upwardly
mobile) tend to have children with better developed literacy
skills hence suggesting a link between socio-economic status
and the development of these skills.
Clark (2007) also highlights how parental involvement is
perhaps most important for those children whose mothers
have less education. The author offers research conducted for
the Harvard Family Research Project, which reported that
increases in family involvement were associated with higher
levels of literacy achievement for families from low socio-
economic backgrounds and that such involvement has the
greatest impact on children who were deemed as "at risk" of
educational failure. Moreover, families who were initially
uninvolved with their children's schooling and then become
more involved exerted a positive influence on their chil-
dren's literacy development. Finally, the research project
claims that this involvement did not have to necessarily be
extensive to have a positive influence on literacy develop-
ment, with meaningful improvement noted for even one or
two additional involvement activities each year.
Moon and Ivins's (2004) examination of barriers to paren-
tal involvement in children's education in the United
Kingdom reported the influence of the variables of gender,
work situation, school level, and perceived responsibility for
their child's education. In particular, the authors noted that
women were more likely to be involved in their children's
education with men less likely to help with homework and to
Al-Mahrooqi et al. 5
be involved in activities such as fund-raising, school trips,
and so on. Parents who worked part-time or who were
employed in a school were also more likely to be involved,
while parents of children in primary schools and parents or
carers who believed that responsibility for their children's
education partially or largely lies with them reported higher
levels of parental involvement. In terms of socio-economic
status, however, Moon and Ivins report that parents in house-
holds where the primary breadwinner worked in unskilled
manual labor were slightly more likely to claim that they felt
very involved in their children's education than other social
classes. However, despite these claims, the authors note that
parents in such households were only likely to participate
more in helping with dinner duties and in school trips than
parents in other socio-economic groups.
Parental Involvement, Literacy, and Arab Learners
Although the studies cited above offer a number of potential
benefits to, and variables influencing, the level of parental
involvement in children's schooling, Al-Barwani, Albeely,
and Al-Suleimani (2012) note that much of the research is
focused on Western societies which have different expecta-
tions about children's levels of independence and of the
involvement of families in the decisions that affect their chil-
dren. For these reasons, it may be problematic to apply find-
ings from studies conducted on Western learners to Arab
countries, as suggested by the somewhat contradictory
results related to Oman and certain other Gulf nations
reported in the IEA (2014) research above.
Moosa, Karabenick, and Adams (2001) took one step
toward addressing the relative dearth of topic-based research
on Arab learners by examining teachers' perceptions of Arab
parental involvement in elementary schools in the United
States. The authors report a widely held belief among teach-
ers that Arab parents in the United States tend not to be
involved in their children's education. This is a result which
participants believed may be due to matters of culture and
tradition. However, despite these beliefs among teachers, a
number of participants also noted the barriers that these par-
ents experienced toward higher levels of involvement,
including a lack of confidence with their English language
skills, and family demands on mothers including looking
after younger children at home. Finally, a number of teachers
believed that Arab parents considered the school as solely
responsible for their children's education and that they were,
subsequently, less likely to participate.
However, despite these beliefs held by teachers, Moosa
etal. (2001) note that most Arab parents reported regularly
attending parent­teacher conferences and almost all of the
Arab mothers claimed they would be willing to participate in
their children's education if requested to do so. The authors
claim that this mismatch of perceptions between teachers
and Arab parents in the United States may be due to a lack of
teachers' cultural knowledge about appropriate forms of
communication for interacting with Arab families. Moosa
etal. offer the example of mothers who agree to participate
in a school activity when directly requested out of politeness
though who fail to attend and are then characterized as disin-
terested. For these reasons, the authors state that it is neces-
sary for teachers of Arab students in English as a second
language (ESL) contexts to experience professional enrich-
ment opportunities to develop culturally relevant skills.
Moving away from ESL contexts to the situation in Oman,
Al-Barwani etal. (2012) highlight how, even as Arab coun-
tries experience rapid changes in the face of globalization,
families in the region largely remain paternalistic and
extended families continue to be involved in decisions
regarding children. For these reasons, Al-Barwani etal. state
that parental involvement, at least at the elementary school
level, enjoys a long tradition in Oman, with open channels of
education existing between schools and families on issues of
behavior, academic progress, and so on. The authors sought
to examine whether this is also the case in higher education
institutions. In their examination of parents' attitudes toward
involvement in higher education, the authors reported that
Omani parents believed they continued to play a major role
in their children's education, with this being expressed
through financial and moral support, keeping track of aca-
demic progress, communicating with teachers, helping solve
academic and social problems, and even helping select their
children's colleges and specializations. Moreover, despite
the potential importance of the variables offered above in
mediating levels of involvement, Al-Barwani etal. reported
that parents' gender, level of educational attainment, the
number of children they have, socio-economic status, and
education levels did not affect their beliefs about the impor-
tance of involvement.
Still within Oman but focusing on kindergarten, rather
than tertiary-level, learners, Al-Qaryouti and Kilani (2013)
examine the level of participation of 314 Omani parents in
terms of the following involvement practices: availability of
materials, home activities, parents' attitudes, and visits to
their children's classes. The authors note that studies con-
ducted on Arab learners, such as those by Abdulrahman
(1986), Ahmad (1991), and Al Daisiti (1991), suggest that
the learners' families' cultural background and/or socio-
economic status were associated with children's readiness to
read and write. After acknowledging this link, Al-Qaryouti
and Kilani explored whether the level of parental support for
children's reading and writing was associated with parents'
educational and economic levels, gender, birth order, and
child's level in the kindergarten.
Findings indicate that there is a link between parents'edu-
cational levels in three of the four participation practices fea-
tured, with the only exception being in the number of visits
to the kindergarten. In terms of socio-economic status, the
researchers report that parents with middle, as opposed to
low or high, income levels tended to more enthusiastic about
literacy practices and hence provided more stimulation for
6 SAGE Open
the development of their children's literacy skills. Gender
and birth order, however, were not found to be related to par-
ents' levels of involvement in the four practices. Finally, the
authors note that, as children progress through kindergarten
levels, parents tended to express greater interest in participat-
ing in the development of their emergent literacy skills.
Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014) examine the nature of
Omani parents' involvement in their children's education in a
study of 40 Omani parents.After acknowledging the potential
impact of social reasons that may hinder such involvement--
such as family size, number of adults, and parents' levels of
education, cultural factors associated with parents'and teach-
ers'ideas of appropriate forms of participation, and economic
factors associated with the abilities of both schools and par-
ents to encourage parental involvement--the authors sought
to examine the ways in which Omani parents are involved in
their children's education, their attitudes toward family
involvement and their effect on their children's academic per-
formance, and the reasons Omani parents highlight as poten-
tially hindering participation.
Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014) claim that most
Omani parents believe participation in their children's school-
ing to almost exclusively involve at-home activities, such as
helping with homework and discussing issues related to
school. However, the authors report that Omani parents usu-
ally do not believe that they should be involved in school-
related activities, either because they thought teachers to be
competent and to not need any input, or because they do not
view school-related activities as important. However, despite
the somewhat limited nature of this involvement, participants
did, nonetheless, maintain that parental involvement contrib-
utes positively to the academic performance of their children
and that higher levels of involvement were associated with
greater motivation among learners and better behavior.
Although these findings largely follow those offered in the
literature from both theArab world and beyond, the authors note
that some of the barriers to parental involvement highlighted
above are not applicable to the Omani context. That is,
Al-Harrasi andAl-Mahrooqi's (2014) findings suggest, "Parents
here do not consider such social reasons as having big families,
having many children, not feeling qualified to offer help, or not
having enough time as hindrances to their involvement"
(p. 281). In addition, parents believed that, although Omani
teachers are highly competent, they retained the right to ques-
tion teachers and administrators about educational decisions.
They also maintained that their jobs did not affect their level of
involvement in their children's education, and that Omani
schools have the processes in place to encourage involvement.
Method
Research Questions
While the above research highlights the nature and type of
parental involvement in their children's education, in addition
to the potential benefit of increased levels of involvement, as
of yet very little research has been conducted that exclusively
focuses on parental involvement in their children's education
in English. Although the studies cited above, focusing on the
link between parental involvement and literacy, suggest that
higher levels of involvement are most likely associated with
the development of learners English language skills, this is a
supposition that is yet to be explored within the Omani con-
text. Moreover, results relating to Arab and/or Omani partici-
pants offered above often report contradictory findings or
results that would not be suggested from the research from the
Western world. For these reasons, the current research sought
to explore the link between Omani parental involvement in
their children's school-based English language education by
examining the following questions:
Research Question 1: What are the potential benefits of
parental involvement in their children's English language
education according to Omani parents?
Research Question 2: What activities related to their
children's English language education do Omani parents
believe they should be involved in?
Research Question 3: Do Omani parents believe any
obstacles exist to parental involvement?
Research Question 4: How often are Omani parents
involved in their children's English language education?
Questionnaire
To explore this issue, two sections from a questionnaire
inquiring into parental attitudes toward English in Oman--
itself part of a nationwide investigation into challenges asso-
ciated with learning English in the country--were analyzed.
The first of these sections related to participants' attitudes
about parental involvement in their children's English learn-
ing. This section was divided into five parts: benefits of
involvement, parent involvement activities, personal reasons
for non-involvement, teacher-related reasons for non-
involvement, and school/administration's reasons for non-
involvement. The second section explored the frequency
with which parents engaged in eight activities related to their
children's English language learning.
Sample
The questionnaires were administered to 391 parents of stu-
dents in the Omani public school system. All background
variables were affected to a certain degree by missing data.
As a result, most of the demographics featured here tally
anywhere between 2% and 16% under 100%. Of the partici-
pants who completed the demographic section of the ques-
tionnaire, 149 were male (37.3%) and 233 were female
(58.3%) while remaining participants did not indicate their
gender. Participants were drawn from the following gover-
norates: Muscat (n = 56, 14.0%), Al-Batinah South (n = 40,
Al-Mahrooqi et al. 7
10%), Al-Batinah North (n = 37, 9.3%), Al-Buraimi (n = 49,
12.3%), Al-Dhahira (n = 48, 12.0%), Al-Dakhilia (n = 42,
10.5%), Al-Wusta (n = 15, 3.8%), Al-Sharqiya North (n = 29,
7.3%), Al-Sharqiya South (n = 62, 15.5%), and Dhofar (n =
13, 3.3%). Across these governorates, 167 participants lived
in cities (41.8%) while 207 (51.8%) lived in villages.
In terms of parents' levels of education, eight participants
(2.0%) did not receive any formal education, 11 (2.8%) had
finished primary school, 19 (4.8%) had completed prepara-
tory schooling, 116 (29.0%) had graduated from secondary
schools, 164 (41.0%) held college diplomas or bachelor's
degrees, and 19 (4.8%) had master's degrees or doctorates.
The vast majority of participants (n = 249, 62.3%) were cur-
rently working while 137 (34.3%) were not employed.
Parents reported having between one child and more than 11
children, with the number of children in each family as fol-
lows: one (n = 13, 3.3%), two (n = 46, 11.5%), three (n = 63,
15.8%), four (n = 67, 16.8%), five (n = 75, 18.8%), six (n =
43, 10.8%), seven (n = 23, 5.8%), eight (n = 27, 6.8%), nine
(n = 14, 3.5%), 10 (n = 4, 1.0%), and 11 or more (n = 4,
1.0%). Participants had the following numbers of children
currently in school: none (n = 20, 5.0%), one (n = 74, 18.5%),
two (n = 90, 22.5%), three (n = 68, 17.0%), four (n = 89,
22.3%), five (n = 30, 7.5%), six (n = 11, 2.8%), and seven (n
= 7, 1.8%). Respondents reported having the following num-
ber of children in Grade 11: none (n = 322, 80.5%), one (n =
62, 15.5%), two (n = 4, 1.0%), three (n = 1, 0.3%). The num-
ber of children in Grade 12 was reported as follows: none
(n = 312, 78.0%), one (n = 71, 17.8%), and two (n = 6, 1.5%).
Twenty-five respondents (6.3%) reported a total family
monthly income of less than 300 Omani rials (OR), 75 (18.8%)
had an income between 300 and 500 OR, 103 (25.8%) made
between 501 and 1,000, while 159 (39.8%) made more than
1,000 OR a month. In terms of frequency of involvement in
theirchildren'sschoolstudies,226participants(56.5%)reported
always being involved, 58 (14.5%) were usually involved, 68
(17.0%) were sometimes involved, 12 (3.0%) were seldom
involved, while six (1.5%) reported never being involved.When
asked about their level ofparticipation in their children's English
studies, 133 (33.3%) were always involved, 84 (21.0%) were
usually involved, 92 (23.0%) were sometimes involved, 43
(10.8%) claimed to be seldom involved, while 22 (5.5%) stated
that they were never involved. Although 391 participants
returned questionnaires, only around 386 of these were com-
pleted with enough information to include in data analysis.
Results
The first section of the questionnaire of interest here related to
parental attitudes toward involvement in their children's
English school studies. Participants were asked to indicate on
a 5-point Likert-type response scale their level of agreement
with a series of items across five categories. Responses ranged
from strongly agree to disagree and had a middle option of
neutral. Interpretations of item and category means are
·
· strongly agree if 1.00 < average < 1.79;
·
· agree if 1.80 < average < 2.59;
·
· neutral if 2.60 < average < 3.39;
·
· disagree 3.40 < average < 4.19;
·
· strongly disagree 4.20 < average < 5.00.
Overall means for the five questionnaire categories from
this part of the questionnaire are
Benefits of involvement--1.50;
Parent involvement activities--1.51;
Teacher-related reasons for non-involvement--3.00;
Personal reasons for non-involvement--3.15;
School/administration reasons for non-involvement--3.27.
Table 1 features the first response category from this part
of the questionnaire: benefits of involvement (M = 1.50).
Parents strongly agreed with each of the four items relating
to the potential benefit of parental involvement in their chil-
dren's schooling. The two items that received the highest lev-
els of agreement were "parental involvement in children's
school results in higher student academic performance" and
"parental involvement helps in solving students' academic
and educational problems promptly and effectively." Both
these items recorded means of 1.45. Participants also strongly
agreed that "students whose parents are involved at their
school are better behaved in classes than those whose parents
are not involved" (M = 1.54) and that "students whose par-
ents are involved in their school are more motivated to learn"
(M = 1.55).
Closely linked with this apparent awareness of the bene-
fits of parental involvement, participants also strongly agreed
with each of the items related to involvement activities
(M = 1.51; see Table 2). Respondents strongly agreed that
parents should "go to school even when their children are not
in trouble" (M = 1.30). They also maintained that they should
"discuss issues related to school with their children at home"
(M = 1.33) and "supervise their children when doing their
homework" (M = 1.44). While they also stated strong levels
of agreement with the belief that "Parents should collaborate
with teachers in preparing teaching materials" (M = 1.70),
the response mean for the item, "Parents should get involved
in school-related activities" (M = 1.79), was on the border
between agree and strongly agree.
In relation to factors that may hinder parental involvement
in their children's schooling, Table 3 indicates that parents
remained neutral about all items associated with whether
teacher-related factors may contribute to their non-involvement
(M = 2.98). That is, participants neither agreed nor disagreed
with the statements, "I think that secondary school teachers'
heavy schedules don't give them time to meet with parents"
(M = 2.67) and "Teachers at my children's schools are not
trained well to deal with parents" (M = 2.87). They were also
neutral in response to items about whether their involvement
was considered valuable and appropriate by teachers: "I do
8 SAGE Open
not feel that teachers appreciate my involvement" (M = 3.01)
and "I do not think that I should question teachers about their
teaching" (M = 3.09). Finally, participants were neutral about
whether "teachers know best about their students so I do not
need to be involved" (M = 3.30).
Table 4 indicates that parents were largely neutral about
the influence of personal reasons on non-involvement (M =
3.15). In fact, of the 13 items associated with this category,
11 received response means placing them within the neutral
response range, while participants only stated disagreement
to two items. That is, parents did not believe that their
responsibilities negatively affected their involvement in their
children's schooling, with neutral responses to "I have so
many responsibilities which prevent me from getting
involved with my children's education" (M = 2.85) and "I do
not discuss school issues with my children because I do not
have enough time" (M = 3.25). With specific reference to
family responsibilities, participants were neutral in response
to the statements that they do "not get involved enough at my
children's schools because I have a big family to take care
of" (M = 2.99) and "do not help my children much with their
homework because I have many children" (M = 3.29). They
also did not see work as interfering with their involvement in
their children's schooling with neutral responses to the fol-
lowing items: "I work for long hours so I do not have time to
visit my children's schools" (M = 2.95) and "I feel so
exhausted after work that I do not help my children with their
homework" (M = 3.18). The school level and school regula-
tions were also not identified by participants as having an
influence on their level of involvement, with neutral means
recorded for the following items: "I only get involved at ele-
mentary schools" (M = 2.88) and "I do not get involved much
with my children's schools because I do not understand the
school system and rules" (M = 3.06). Participants also
remained neutral about whether they do not help their "chil-
dren with their homework because I want them to be inde-
pendent" (M = 2.91), while also being neutral about whether
their children's learning was the sole responsibility of teach-
ers: "I do not help my children much with their homework
because I do not feel qualified enough to do so" (M = 3.24)
and "I believe that teachers are the only ones responsible for
their students' academic performance" (M = 3.32). In fact,
the only items parents disagreed with from this part of the
questionnaire related to the lack of importance of parental
involvement. That is, they disagreed with the items, "I do not
get involved in my children's schools because I do not think
that will make a difference" (M = 3.40) and "I do not believe
that parental involvement in school matters is important"

Participants were neutral about two of the four items from
this category. These were "My children's school is not

involvement" (M = 2.91) and "Administrators at my chil-

(M = 3.27). They stated disagreement with the remaining
items regarding the influence of distance and class size on
their involvement: "My children's school is too far for me
to visit often" (M = 3.40) and "My children's school has big
student numbers, so I do not like to go there" (M = 3.48).
The final questionnaire section asked participants to indi-
cate how frequently they were involved in their children's
English studies. Item means for this part of the questionnaire
were interpreted as

·
· rarely if 1.80 < average < 2.59;
·

English" (M = 3.74), even though they believed that they
were only sometimes "involved in my children's English
studies" (M = 3.07). Participants stated that they were also
sometimes involved in three specific activities related to
their children's English learning. These were "I supervise my
children when doing their English homework" (M = 3.19), "I
encourage my children to use and practice their English
around the house and beyond the classroom" (M = 3.05), and

Discussion
This article sought to explore the attitudes and practices of
Omani parents toward parental involvement in their chil-
dren's schooling. In doing so, it explored the following
research questions.
Research Question 1: What are the potential benefits of
parental involvement in their children's education accord-
ing to Omani parents?
Participants highlighted a number of potential benefits of
involvement in their children's schooling. They believed that
their involvement not only contributed toward higher levels
of academic achievement for their children, but also allowed
them to help solve any academic and educational problems
that their children may face. In this way, participants here
showed similarities in attitudes to the parents of Omani ter-
tiary students reported by Al-Qaryouti and Kilani (2013).
Participants also highlighted their belief that parental
involvement is associated with better behavior among their
children at school and higher levels of motivation to learn. In
this way, Omani parents displayed an awareness of some of
the academic, psychological, and social benefits of increased
levels of parental involvement as highlighted by scholars
including Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014), Berthelsen
and Walker (2008), Clark (2007), and Moon and Ivins
(2004). Moreover, these findings also lend support to
Al-Barwani etal.'s (2012) contention that parental involve-
ment in children's education is widely practiced in Oman and
enjoys a long tradition.
Research Question 2: What activities related to their
children's English language education do Omani parents
believe they should be involved in?
The Omani parents featured in this research strongly
believed that they should be involved in a number of activi-
ties associated with their children's schooling, or what
Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995) describe as choice of
involvement forms. These included the school-related activi-
ties of making visits to their children's school and getting
involved in other school-related activities including prepar-
ing materials for use at school. Moreover, participants stated
that at home they should discuss school matters with their
children while also supervising homework. Interestingly,
Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014) maintain that parents in
Oman tend to limit their involvement in their children's edu-
cation to home activities, such as the last two involvement
activities listed here. However, the authors continue, these
parents tend to be more reluctant to actually attend their chil-
dren's school to assist with activities. This is a belief that was
not supported by the first questionnaire section, although the
relative infrequency of parental involvement activities, at
least as they relate to English studies, reported in the final
part of the questionnaire may lend some support to this
supposition.
Research Question 3: Do Omani parents believe any
obstacles exist to parental involvement?
The current research explored three main areas as poten-
tially contributing to the non-involvement of Omani parents:
teacher-related factors, personal reasons, and school/admin-
istration reasons. Omani parents' responses indicated that
they did not consider any of these factors to negatively affect
their levels of involvement in their children's schooling. For
instance, they were neutral about whether teachers' heavy
workloads and lack of training in dealing with parents had an
impact upon their involvement, while also being unsure
about whether they had the right to question their children's

teachers' decisions because "teachers know best." The level
of neutrality could be argued to offer a small amount of sup-
port for Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi's (2014) findings that,
although Omani parents acknowledge that teachers are gen-
erally competent and well-trained, they still believe they
have the right to question teacher decisions, even though a
lack of firm agreement or disagreement here leaves this mat-
ter open to debate.
Parent participants also did not believe that either their
work- or family-related responsibilities decreased their level
of involvement in their children's schools. In findings that
may lend support for Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi's (2014)
research, results here suggest that parents were neutral about
whether having a big family had any influence on their level
of involvement. Moreover, they also did not identify work-
ing long hours and feeling exhausted from their work as
important factors. Personal reasons related to the school
itself, such as its distance from home and the school level,
were also not considered important factors in non-involve-
ment by participants. Respondents, moreover, did not agree
that they felt unqualified to be involved and, in fact, stated
disagreement with the idea that only teachers are responsible
for their children's education and that their involvement
would not make a difference. This, again, is a finding that
was suggested by Al-Barwani etal.'s (2012) belief that the
traditional patriarchal nature of Omani families supports the
input of the extended family in all important matters relating
to their children.
Factors related more specifically to school and school
administration were also not considered to have an important
influence on parental involvement. That is, parents were neu-
tral about whether their children's schools had the necessary
programs to facilitate their involvement and also about
whether school administrators encouraged such engagement.
DET (2001) highlights the importance of schools creating
structures and training staff to enable parents to participate in
an effective manner, so the neutral response range here may
suggest that Omani schools could put more systems in place
to facilitate parental involvement. This is a practice that is
strongly recommended by Family-School and Community
Partnerships Bureau (2011) to positively affect students'
well-being and academic success.
Research Question 4: How often are Omani parents
involved in their children's English language education?
Despite parents' awareness of the importance of parental
involvement in their children's schooling and their belief that
very few personal, teacher- or school-administration-related
barriers exist to their involvement in their children's formal
schooling, participants claimed to only be often involved in
one activity related to their children's English language
learning: encouraging them to do their best with English.
Moreover, participants stated that they were only sometimes
involved in their children's English studies, despite the fact
that 56.5% of participants claimed to always be involved in
their children's general education.
In terms of their English studies, parents stated that they
occasionally supervised their children's homework, encour-
aged them to use English at home, and met with their chil-
dren's English teachers to discuss their academic progress.
Interestingly, two of these three involvement activities are
related to the home, which tends to support Al-Harrasi and
Al-Mahrooqi's (2014) supposition that most Omani parents
limit their participant to home-based activities, despite rec-
ognizing the importance of school-based activities as high-
lighted above. Moreover, Omani parents here claimed that
they were rarely involved in their school activities related to
English, and that they were not likely to find a private English
tutor for their children. This former finding, in particular,
may be associated with parents' neutral attitudes as to
whether the school and its teachers are welcoming of their
participation in such activities, and about whether the struc-
tures are in place to encourage their participation.
Conclusion
The current study sought to examine attitudes toward, and
practices associated with, Omani parents' involvement in
their children's education with a specific focus on those prac-
tices related to English language learning. Results here indi-
cate that Omani parents are generally aware of the importance
of their involvement on their children's academic, social, and
even psychological development. Moreover, they believe
that parents should be involved in a number of home- and
school-based activities, such as visiting their children's
schools even when their children are not in trouble and being
actively involved in other school activities, even though their
actual level of involvement in their children's English lan-
guage studies was somewhat limited. Participants tended to
be neutral about the nature of any personal, teacher, school,
or administration obstacles to their involvement in their chil-
dren's education, although the implication exists that schools
could do more to create and staff systems that actively seek
to encourage their participation, at least as far as English lan-
guage classes are concerned. The establishment of these sys-
tems in line with the advice of DET (2001) could function to
inform parents about the benefits of increased levels of par-
ticipation and appropriate channels for such participation. In
this way, parents who may be reluctant to participate can see
that their input is valued, hence increasing their level of self-
efficacy in contributing to their children's development of
English language as highlighted by Emerson etal. (2012).
Hence, parental involvement at the school level can be sys-
temic, integrated, and sustainable, as recommended by the
Family-School and Community Partnerships Bureau (2011).
With more specific reference to English, the creation of
higher levels of dialogue between schools, parents, and the
wider community is one way to overcome the often-reported
limitations of English language learning within Oman. This
12 SAGE Open
is an important goal of educational reforms in the country,
and the springboard for the current nationwide investigation
on which this current research is based, and is one that could
benefit from the establishment of clearer pathways for Omani
parental involvement in their children's English studies.
