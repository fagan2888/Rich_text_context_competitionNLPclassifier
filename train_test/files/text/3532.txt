Abstract
Background: Previous studies on stroke recurrence in younger adults often contain small sample size which makes it
difficult to study trends in stroke recurrence over a long period of time.
Aims: The aim of the present study was to investigate temporal trends in the risk of recurrence in younger patients with
a first ischemic stroke.
Methods: All men and women aged 18­54 years who had survived at least 28 days after a first ischemic stroke from
1987 to 2006 were identified in the Swedish Inpatient Register. The patients were stratified into four 5-year periods
according to their admission period and were followed up for a total of four years after the index event with regard to
recurrent ischemic stroke. A Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.
Results: Of the 17,149 ischemic stroke patients who were identified, 2432 (14.2%) had a recurrent ischemic stroke
event within four years. From the first to the last periods (1987­1991 versus 2002­2006), the four-year risk of recurrent
ischemic stroke decreased by 55% (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.39­0.53) in men and 59% (hazard ratio
0.41, 95% confidence interval, 0.33­0.50) in women. The cumulative four-year risk was 11.8% (95% CI 10.55­13.25) in
men and 9.8% (95% CI 8.40­11.46) in women during the last five-year period (2002­2006).
Conclusions: The risk of recurrence among younger ischemic stroke patients has decreased over the past 20 years.
Despite these improvements, younger patients are still at a high risk for recurrent ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is a serious condition with a high risk of disabil-
ity and long-lasting consequences, which increase not
only the risk of premature death, but also of future
vascular events.1­3 Over the past years, mortality of
stroke in most Western countries has decreased and
the number of patients surviving their first stroke is
increasing.4­6 Vascular outcomes, such as recurrent
stroke, are becoming increasingly more important
because they may further increase the risk of disability
and premature death.
The Global Burden of Disease Study reported that a
significant amount of the incidence of stroke, preva-
lence of stroke, and death-related stroke, and over
two-thirds of disability-adjusted life years lost occur
in people younger than 75 years old.7 However, most
studies on outcome after stroke are based on elderly
people with findings that may not be applicable to
younger adults. Previous studies have reported that
the risk of a recurrent stroke among younger people

within the first year varies from 2 to 4%, decreasing
thereafter to less than 3% yearly.8­11 Most prior studies
on younger adults have been limited by small sample
sizes. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have
investigated trends and changes in risk over a long
period of time in younger patients with ischemic stroke
(IS). Information on prognosis and outcome is import-
ant for understanding the etiology of stroke and also in
understanding how to improve outcome after a stroke.
Aims
This study aimed to examine temporal trends and the
cumulative risk of recurrent IS over time in younger
adults aged 18­54 years who were hospitalized with a
first-time IS in Sweden from 1987 to 2006.
Methods
Swedish hospitals are required to report principal and
contributory diagnoses of all patients to the national
Inpatient Register (IPR), which started in 1964, and
has been operating on a nationwide basis since 1987.
In the current study, data from the IPR and Cause of
Death Register were linked using the unique Swedish
personal identifier number (a unique 10-digit number).
All diagnoses are coded according to the International
Classification of Disease (ICD) system, with ICD-8
from 1968 until 1987, ICD-9 from 1987 until 1996,
and ICD-10 from 1996 and onward. The positive pre-
dictive value (PPV) for discharge diagnosis differs for
diagnoses in the IPR but is generally 85­95%.12 In
2004, the PPV for first-ever stroke was 94%.13
Study population
All patients aged 18­54 years who survived at least 28
days after a first hospitalization with a principal dis-
charge diagnosis of IS from 1987 to 2006 were identi-
fied using ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes of 434 and 436 and
the ICD-10 codes I63 and I64. The use of ICD-9 code
433 was considered but not included in the final ana-
lysis due to uncertainty of the diagnosis in the IPR (625
men and 344 women). Because the IPR data were not
complete until 1987, all IS cases were consistently
regarded as a first-time event after a time frame of
seven years using data from 1980 and onward. This
was performed for each separate year from 1987 to
2006 to ensure that all data were treated as uniformly
as possible. A total of 17,149 cases were identified as a
first-time IS and were stratified into four time periods
according to the admission period: 1987­1991, 1992­
1996, 1997­2001, and 2002­2006. Patients were fol-
lowed at 1­6 months, 6­12 months, 1­2 years, 2­3
years, 3­4 years, and 0­4 years for recurrent IS.
Recurrent IS was defined as either a fatal (death in
hospital) or nonfatal event that occurred 28 days after
index hospitalization and with at least two days
between discharge from hospital and the next admis-
sion (Figure 1). Because a death outside hospital
ascribed to IS could not be considered as a recurrent
event with certainty, we excluded 20 cases where this
had occurred. From 1987 to 2006, there was a total of
2432 recurrent IS (1579 men and 853 women) among
17,149 IS patients (Figure 1). A limited number of hem-
orrhagic stroke events were not included (179 men and
79 women). The main author (KWG) and a stroke
physician (CHS) separately reviewed a subsample (100
cases) of all cases to ascertain that the selection process
was appropriate, particularly with respect to readmis-
sion to a rehabilitation unit for the index stroke, which
could be ruled out in all cases.
The IPR and outpatient register was used to identify
all comorbidities. For surgery codes only IPR was used.
Comorbidities over a period extending seven years
before and including the index hospitalization for the
first IS event were included. The following main or con-
tributory discharge codes were used (ICD-10 (ICD-8;
ICD-9)) atrial fibrillation, I48 (427.92; 427D); coronary
heart disease, I20­I25 (410­414); heart failure, I50
(427.00, 427.10; 428); hypertension, I10­I15 (401­
405); malignancy, C00­C97 (140­208); congenital
heart disease, Q20­Q26 (746­747; 745­747); valvular
disease, I05­I09 and I34­I35 (394­397; 424) diabetes,
E10­E14 (250); and previous acute myocardial infarc-
tion I21 (410). Surgical treatment was defined by the
following codes: coronary artery bypass grafting 3066,
3067, 3105, 3127, FNA, FNB, FNE, and FNC; and
percutaneous coronary intervention: 3080, FNG 00,
FNG 02, and FNG 05.
Ethics
For anonymity, all personal identifiers were removed
and replaced with a code in the final data set. The pre-
sent study was approved by the regional Ethics Board
of Gothenburg.
Statistical analysis
All calculations were performed with SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and graphs were pro-
duced using R version 2.15.1. Baseline characteristics
are presented as proportions and percentages for each
individual comorbidity by sex and time period.
Incidence rate for recurrent IS was calculated as the
number of individuals having recurrence divided by
the total follow-up time for each time interval of 1­6
months, 6­12 months, 1­2 years, 3­4 years, and 0­4
years. This was done separately by sex and time period.

Cox proportional hazard regression with 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) was used to calculate changes in
the risk of recurrent IS over time. The first period
(1987­1991) was used as the reference. All final
models were adjusted for age with interaction of time
to adjust for proportionality. The cumulative risk of
recurrence and stroke-free survival (defined as free
from recurrent IS and death) were estimated with the
Kaplan­Meier method.
Results
A total of 17,149 men and women surviving a first-time
IS were identified. Of these, 2432 (14.2%) had a recur-
rent IS within four years. Table 1 shows baseline char-
acteristics of the study population by sex and time
period. The most common diagnosis of comorbidity
in men and women was hypertension (23.7% in men
and 19.8% in women) followed by diabetes (13.5% in
men and 11.5% in women).
Temporal trends in the incidence rate
of IS and risk of recurrent IS
Tables 2 and 3 show sex-specific trends in recurrent IS
over time. During the study period, the four-year risk
decreased by 55% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, 95% CI
0.39­0.53) in men and 59% (HR 0.41, 95% CI
0.33­0.50) in women, with an average incidence rate
of 3.04 and 2.52 per 100 person-years, respectively.
Supplementary Table 1 shows age-specific trends in
recurrent IS over time. The four-year risk decreased
in most age groups in men and women but no signifi-
cant improvement was observed in the youngest age
group (18­25 years). The recurrence rate of IS declined
over time but was still highest within the first months,
regardless of time period when compared to subsequent
years (Table 3). The risk of recurrent IS from the first
(1987­1991) to the last period (2002­2006) for men
decreased by 64% at the time interval of 1­6 months
(HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28­0.45), 58% at 6­12 months
(HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30­0.59), and 58% at 1­2 years
(HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29­0.61). However, among those
remaining at risk, there was no significant improvement
at 2­3 years (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51­1.17) or 3­4 years
(HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.51­1.21). Among women, the risk
of recurrent IS decreased by 76% at 1­6 months (HR
0.24, 95% CI 0.17­0.33) and 41% at 6­12 months (HR
0.59, 95% CI 0.37­0.94) until the third period (1997­
2001); however, this was not sustained through the final
period (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49­1.20). There was a
decrease of 56% for the risk of recurrent IS at 1­2
years (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27­0.72) and a decrease of
55% until the third period at 2­3 years (HR 0.45, 95%
CI 0.23­0.89), but this was also not sustained into the
final period. Similar to men, no significant improve-
ment was observed at 3­4 years (HR 0.99, 95% CI
0.42­2.31).

within the first months, but this effect was largely
sustained over the first 2­3 years. The four-year cumu-

despite these improvements, almost one in six patients
had either died or had a recurrent stroke within four
years in the last period.
In a report from the population-based Monitoring
Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease
Stroke Incidence Registry, a 36% decline in recurrence
of stroke was observed in 6700 stroke patients when
comparing the periods of 1995­1998 with 2004­
2008.15 In a Scottish study by Lewey et al., stroke
patients who were hospitalized in 2001 had a 27%
lower risk of recurrence compared with individuals
who were hospitalized with a stroke in 1986.16
However, none of these studies have separately investi-
gated temporal trends in younger IS patients.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the
largest studies conducted on recurrent IS in younger
patients with IS. In the present study, we found that
the four-year risk of recurrent IS declined in both men
and women during the study period. Similar trends
were observed in most age groups over time except
for the youngest group (18­25 years). However, the
results should be interpreted with caution since the
numbers of recurrent events were limited. Consistent
with previous reports, we found that the risk of recur-
rence of IS was highest during the first several months
and up to a year after the index event, regardless of
time periods.10,14 After the first year, the rate of recur-
rence declined and was less than 2% annually during
the last period (2002­2006). Additionally, we showed
that most of the decrease in risk occurred within the
first six months to one year. No improvements were
observed at the time intervals of 2­3 years and 3­4

years in men. However, women showed a more compli-
cated pattern, with a significant decline in risk after six
months at a time interval of 1­2 years during the last
period and until the third period (1997­2001) at 6­12
months and 2­3 years. Again, these results should be
interpreted with caution because the number of recur-
rent IS cases was limited.
There are several possible explanations for the
decline in recurrent IS. Improved treatment of cardio-
vascular risk factors, such as blood pressure levels and
smoking rates over time, likely contributed to better
survival and less severe stroke cases.17,18 The use of
antihypertensive, antiplatelet, anticoagulation, and
lipid-lowering drugs in secondary prevention is import-
ant for reducing the risk of recurrent IS.19 Prescription
of these medications has increased over time.20
However, Glader et al. showed that persistent use of
secondary prevention medications (e.g. statins and war-
farin) decreased within the first two years after IS.21
A discontinuation of secondary preventive medication
after discharge from hospital has previously been
shown to be a risk predictor for recurrent events
among younger IS patients.11 Therefore, a poor adher-
ence to medication over time might explain why no
significant improvements were observed for men and
women at the time interval of 3­4 years. In addition,

previous studies have shown that patients who are trea-
ted at stroke units have a better outcome than those
who are treated at a general ward,22 especially for those
<65 years of age.23 The positive effect on outcome may
be the result of a multidisciplinary team effort with
focus on early treatment, better adherence to medica-
tions, and rehabilitation in stroke patients.21,24 In
Sweden, the number of stroke units has increased for
the past two decades and a majority of all patients are
now being treated at a stroke unit.25 It is our belief that
improved secondary preventions and better accessibil-
ity to stroke units over time have most likely contrib-
uted to a better prognosis after an IS.
In comparison to the MONICA and the Scottish
study with older patients, we found a slightly larger
decline in the risk of recurrent IS over time.15,16 Our
result does not necessarily indicate that secondary pre-
vention treatments have been more effective on younger
IS patients. Instead, possible explanations for the dif-
ferences in the risk decline may be that older patients
have more complications, comorbidity, higher case
fatality rate, and a poorer recovery rate than younger
individuals. In addition, younger, as opposed to older,
patients may receive a more thorough investigation and
careful follow-up.
Overall, an increase in comorbidities was observed
throughout the study period. This finding could be
explained by better clinical reporting, partly because
of changes in financial incitements over the years.12
Dyslipidemia has previously been reported to be a
prevalent risk factor among younger IS patients and a
potential predictor for recurrent events.14,26 The valid-
ity of lipid disorders in the Swedish IPR is low and
most likely underreported.12 Therefore, it was not
included in the present study. The marked increase in
hypertension during the study period may partly be
owing to changes in definition (currently > 140/
90 mmHg) by the World Health Organization.27
There are some limitations and strengths to our
study. A strength of our study is use of the IPR. This
registry has near-complete coverage of all hospitalized
stroke cases in Sweden which is required to identify the
large population needed for IS cases because it is an
uncommon diagnosis in younger adults. A limitation of
our study is the potential variation in diagnosis of
stroke that has been set by physicians over time.
However, imaging diagnostics were routinely used
throughout the study period, and these largely exclude
hemorrhagic stroke and cerebral malignancies. Clinical
data on severity of stroke, neurological impairment,
functional recovery, medications, and other hospital
treatments were not available, which limits the inter-
pretation of the data. Another potential limitation is
that there is no specific coding for recurrent IS in the
IPR. However, to account for this, we used a strict
protocol and selected only those cases that occurred
after 28 days, specifying a time window of at least
two days after discharge to avoid false-positive cases.
Conclusions
The risk of recurrence in younger patients with IS has
decreased over time, particularly during the first year
after an IS. However, younger patients have a substan-
tial risk of recurrent IS, and a high proportion still
either die or have a new stroke over a four-year
period. Because younger stroke patients have more to
lose than older patients in terms of quality of life and
disability-free remaining lifetime, development of new
strategies and improvements of secondary preventions
including medications and lifestyle changes should be
prioritized. To further improve outcome, improving
understanding of the needs of younger stroke patients
and recognizing that they might be different from older
patients are important.
