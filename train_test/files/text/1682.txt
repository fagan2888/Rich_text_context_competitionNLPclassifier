Background. The present study examined the relationship between insulin resistance and both waist circumference and
cardiorespiratory fitness in U.S. adolescents. Methods. NHANES assessed a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents
(12­18 yrs) between 1999­2002. Abdominal adiposity was estimated by waist circumference, overall adiposity by BMI, and
cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen uptake (VO2
max) from a treadmill exercise test). Insulin resistance was estimated from
fasting insulin and glucose using the homeostatic model assessment method (i.e., HOMA) and was log-transformed. Results. 1078
adolescents were included in the study. Positive correlations existed between lnHOMA and waist circumference (r = 0.59; r = 0.54)
for boys and girls, respectively. lnHOMA and VO2
max were inversely related in boys (r = -0.29) but not girls (r = -0.06.)
Gender-specific analyses by BMI category showed that the significant inverse relationship in lnHOMA and VO2
max was primarily
present in obese boys. Conclusion. Among adolescents, important gender and BMI differences exist in the relationship between
insulin resistance and fitness. While waist circumference and BMI are important predictors in all children, fitness appears especially
important in obese boys. These findings may have important implications for gender-specific interventions to prevent adult obesity
and diabetes mellitus.
1. Introduction
Recent studies have identified a growing epidemic of child-
hood obesity in the United States [1, 2] and it has been
estimated that one in three US children born in 2000 will
develop diabetes mellitus at some point in their lifetime
[3]. Hannon et al. [4] have reviewed the pathophysiologic
relationship between childhood obesity and the subsequent
development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The importance of
insulin resistance in this process was underscored by Bacha et
al. [5] who demonstrated that, in obese adolescents of similar
body mass index (BMI), the relative magnitude of insulin
resistance at any given BMI value contributed substantially
to the risk for metabolic comorbidities and diabetes mellitus.
In addition to obesity levels, cardioresipratory fitness
may influence insulin resistance; however, to what degree is
still unclear. Data in adults suggests that abdominal adiposity
is a stronger predictor of insulin resistance than fitness [6].
This relationship in children has been the subject of multiple
investigations [7­11] with varying results. Works by Ball
et al. [9], and Krekoukia et al. [12] in children describe
the relatively greater importance of central adiposity/waist
circumference as a determinant of insulin resistance. In
contrast, Allen et al. [7] and Kasa-Vubu et al. [13] suggest
that cardiorespiratory fitness is of greater importance as
a determinant of insulin resistance in children and young
adults. Imperatore et al. [14] describe the importance of
cardiorespiratory fitness to insulin sensitivity, but did not
study the relative contribution of abdominal adiposity.
While, Lee et al. [15] first described the distribution of
insulin resistance in adolescents using the homeostatic model
assessment (HOMA), they did not examine the relative
contributions of either abdominal adiposity or cardiorespi-
ratory fitness. Rizzo et al. [16] and Lee et al. [11] reported
that the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and
insulin sensitivity in children is mediated by the degree of
2 Journal of Obesity
adiposity. Further, Eisenmann et al. [10] found that, within
a BMI category, increased cardiorespiratory fitness improved
insulin sensitivity in children.
Data reported by Pate et al. [17] from NHANES on
12­19 years old adolescents suggests that cardiorespiratory
fitness is higher in boys than in girls and is reduced
in overweight adolescents; however, the authors did not
examine the relationship to insulin resistance. Given the
inconclusive results, the purpose of this study was to examine
the relationship of waist circumference and cardiorespiratory
fitness to insulin resistance by weight category, race, gender,
and age in a large nationally representative sample of US
adolescents, aged 12­18 years.
2. Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is conducted annually by the National Center
for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and provides data on a variety of
health and nutritional parameters for US citizens. NHANES
uses complex probability sampling with a cluster sample
design. The 1999­2002 NHANES data was chosen for
the present study because adolescents aged 12­19 years
old were oversampled in these years to provide more
precise population estimates. The NHANES protocol was
approved by the CDC's institutional review board and
written informed consent, from legal guardians, and minor
assent was obtained.
The present study included all children aged 12­18
years old who participated in the fasting subsample of
the NHANES 1999­2002 survey and who had available
cardiorespiratory fitness data. Data was analyzed in 2008.
Those excluded from the study were those who did not have
a fasting blood sample or those who were excluded from
exercise treadmill testing because of cardiovascular or pul-
monary conditions, morbid obesity, pregnancy, amputation
or disability, or other conditions, or medication use that
might pose a risk.
BMI was calculated from height and weight measured
by trained technicians using methods described by the
NHANES manual for anthropometrics [18­20]. Using the
CDC growth charts for US children, BMI values were
then used to categorize each adolescent as normal weight
(5th­84th percentile), overweight (85th­94th percentile),
or obese (95th percentile) [21]. Waist circumference, a
measure of abdominal adiposity, was measured to the
nearest 0.1 cm at the highest point of the iliac crest. The
technicians were trained on the proper procedures for
measuring waist circumference and reliability checks were
conducted throughout the data collection process [20].
Waist circumference was chosen as a measure of abdominal
adiposity in this study because of its availability in NHANES
databases, because it can be easily and reliably measured
in primary care practices, and because it is associated with
cardiovascular risk [22­24].
Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured using a sub-
maximal exercise treadmill test using a protocol specific
to the individual's predicted fitness level and designed to
achieve 80% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate [25].
The technicians were trained on the proper procedures for
administering the aerobic fitness test and reliability checks
were conducted throughout the data collection process
by experienced personnel [25]. Estimated maximal oxygen
uptake (VO2max) was determined by extrapolation of data
from the heart rate response following the two main stages
of the treadmill exercise test to an expected age-specific heart
rate standard as specified by NHANES.
Venous blood was obtained following at least an 8-
hour fast and was analyzed for glucose by the hexokinase
technique and for insulin by radioimmunoassay technique as
described in the NHANES methods [26]. The homeostatic
model assessment (HOMA) was used to estimate insulin
resistance, based on the work of Keskin et al. [27] who found
it to have acceptable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing
insulin resistance in children. HOMA was calculated from
fasting glucose and insulin as follows: the product of the
fasting value of glucose (expressed as mg/dL) and insulin
(expressed as U/mL) is divided by 405. The resulting value
was subsequently log transformed (lnHOMA) to normalize
the distribution.
For statistical analysis, univariate comparisons utilized
Pearson correlation coefficients for continuous variables (i.e.,
age, BMI, waist circumference, VO2max, and lnHOMA)
using SPSS (Version 15, Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences, Chicago; IL). T-tests and analysis of variance with
Bonferoni correction were used for multiple within gender
comparisons of means by tertiles (high fitness for boys,
girls: VO2max  50.52, 41.22, resp.) (moderate fitness for
boys, girls: VO2max  42.99, 35.81; VO2max < 50.52, 41.22,
resp.) and (low fitness for boys, girls; VO2max  42.99,
35.81, resp.) of cardiorespiratory fitness using SAS-callable
SUDAAN (version 9, SAS, Cary, NC).
Multivariate analysis involved the construction of several
linear regression models. These models examined the relative
association of waist circumference, BMI, and VO2max with
lnHOMA by gender, while controlling for the effects of age
(in months), and race (Caucasian versus non-Caucasian). In
the final regression model, waist circumference and VO2max
were compared directly in all adolescents and in those with
a normal BMI versus those over the 85th percentile, and
BMI was excluded from the model because of the potential
interaction of BMI and waist circumference.
All analyses utilized NHANES weights to accommodate
for the complex sampling design of NHANES. The weights
account for the geographic probability sampling methods,
the oversampling of specific groups such as minorities and
adolescents, and are designed to insure the representativeness
of the weighted findings to that of all adolescents in the U.S.
Statistical significance was set at alpha < 0.05.
3. Results
A total of 1,078 adolescents from the NHANES database
aged 12­18 years with complete data were included in the
present analysis and their demographic characteristics are
shown in Table 1. Forty-six percent of the participants were
girls and 38% were non-Caucasian (includes 14% African

The majority of participants were normal weight and 36%
were either overweight or obese. The distribution of obesity
status was similar between boys and girls. Estimated VO2max
was significantly higher in boys than girls (P <.01); however,
there was no significant difference in waist circumference
by gender. The mean age for the participants in the
normal, overweight, and obese groups was similar; however,
mean HOMA was significantly higher in the overweight
(3.0 versus 2.3, P <.001) and obese (5.4 versus 2.3, P
<.001) groups than in normal weight adolescents. Likewise,
mean waist circumference was significantly higher in the
overweight (85.4 versus 73.5 cm, P <.001) and obese (100.7
versus 73.5 cm, P <.001) groups than in normal weight
adolescents. In contrast, estimated VO2max was higher in
the normal weight group (44.5 mL·kg-1·min-1) compared
to the overweight (41.5 mL·kg-1·min-1, P <.05) and obese
(41.3 mL·kg-1·min-1, P <.01) groups.
Table 2 shows the correlation coefficients between
lnHOMA, VO2max, waist circumference, and BMI for the
entire sample and by gender. For the total sample, a positive
and significant relationship existed between lnHOMA and
both waist circumference and BMI. There was a mod-
est inverse relationship between lnHOMA and estimated
VO2max.
When the correlations were separated by gender, the
moderate and significantly positive correlations were still
observed between lnHOMA and both waist circumference
and BMI for both boys and girls. Further, a modest yet
significant inverse correlation was present between lnHOMA
and estimated VO2max for boys, but not for girls. To clarify
the role of estimated VO2max within gender, we separated
boys and girls into tertiles based on their estimated VO2max
and found a significant pattern of differences in HOMA
in boys by fitness level (see Figure 1). By contrast, mean
HOMA values in girls by fitness level did not show a
consistent pattern. Interestingly, when we compared normal
weight low fitness boys and girls to overweight/obese high
fitness boys and girls a difference was only observed among
the girls. A subanalysis examined this relationship with
VO2max corrected by lean body mass. Lean body mass was
determined by DEXA and was available on 536 adolescents.
After correcting for lean body mass, mean HOMA values
were similar across fitness and obesity categories for both
boys and girls (data not shown). Therefore, among boys the
differences observed in HOMA values by fitness were no
longer present.
The initial regression analysis for lnHOMA, BMI, waist
circumference, and estimated VO2max for the entire sample
and by gender, controlling for race and age is presented
in Table 3. For all children, waist circumference, BMI, and
estimated VO2max were significant independent predictors
of lnHOMA after adjusting for race and age. Gender-
specific analyses showed that BMI remained a significant
independent predictor of lnHOMA in both boys and girls.
However, waist circumference and estimated VO2max were
both significant independent predictors of lnHOMA in boys,
but not girls. In the final model comparing only waist
circumference and estimated VO2max without BMI (see
Table 3), waist circumference remained a significant inde-
pendent predictor for both boys and girls while estimated
VO2max was a significant independent predictor for only
boys and not girls. To clarify this further, separate gender-
specific regression models were run by BMI group (normal
versus >85th percentile), and demonstrated that, among
boys, waist circumference was a significant independent
predictor of lnHOMA in both BMI groups while cardiores-
piratory fitness was a significant independent predictor of
lnHOMA only in the group above the 85th percentile of BMI
for age and gender (data not shown). Among girls, waist
circumference was a significant independent predictor of
lnHOMA in both BMI groups while cardiorespiratory fitness
was not a significant independent predictor of lnHOMA in
either BMI group (data not shown).

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship
of insulin resistance and waist circumference and cardiores-
piratory fitness in a large nationally representative sample of

children. Univariate analysis showed that increasing abdom-
inal adiposity, as measured by waist circumference, was
associated with increasing insulin resistance, as measured by
HOMA. Similar results have been demonstrated by other
investigators using various markers for insulin resistance and
body composition [7, 12, 28, 29]. After controlling for race
and age, increased abdominal adiposity was associated with
insulin resistance for the entire sample and in boys and girls.
Interestingly, others have reported a relationship between
insulin resistance and total percent body fat in boys, but
not girls [7]. A possible reason for the difference in results
between the current study and Allen et al. [7] is due to
participant and methodological differences. In the Allen et
al. [7] study, participants were younger (Mean age = 12.9
years) and were all obese (BMI  30 kg·m-2). In contrast,
the NHANES sample used in the current study consisted
of participants averaging 14 years old and the majority of
participants were normal weight. Further, Allen et al. [7]
measured percent body fat; whereas the current study was
interested in abdominal adiposity as measured via waist
circumference.
Abdominal adiposity is not the only concern; overall
BMI may also be a factor in insulin resistance. Univariate
analysis showed that BMI was related to lnHOMA in the total
sample and within each gender. Further, after controlling for
race and age, BMI remained as an independent predictor
of lnHOMA in both genders. Others have reported that
HOMA scores and other insulin resistance measures increase
as BMI levels increase [10, 12, 28]. The current study also
showed that increasing levels of cardiorespiratory fitness
are associated with lower levels of insulin resistance for
all children. A study by Krekoukia et al. [12] showed that
cardiorespiratory fitness was not a significant predictor of
insulin resistance. One possible reason for differing results is
that Krekoukia et al. [12] measured cardiorespiratory fitness
using a cycle ergometer and the age of the participants
Journal of Obesity 5
was 9­11 years old, whereas, the current study used a
treadmill protocol and the participants were 12­18 years old.
The cycle ergometer could have produced localized muscle
fatigue earlier than the treadmill, or the lower physiological
development of the participants in the Krekoukia et al. [12]
study could have limited performance of the exercise test.
When separated by fitness level, significant differences
in insulin resistance were observed in boys, but not in girls.
Interestingly, when we compared HOMA levels across fitness
levels, overweight/obese high fit girls had higher HOMA
values compared to normal weight low fit girls. A similar
finding was not observed among the boys; the HOMA levels
of these two groups were similar in the boys. These results
suggest that fitness is an important factor in boys more so
than girls. However, in a subanalysis, after adjusting aerobic
fitness level by lean body mass, there were no differences
in HOMA values within the normal and overweight/obese
groups. The lack of difference in HOMA values could be
due to similar lean body mass levels among boys within the
normal (high fitness = 47.9 ± 2.5 kg; middle fitness = 46.1
± 0.9 kg; low fitness = 45.5 ± 1.3 kg) and overweight/obese
(high fitness = 57.8 ± 2.8 kg; middle fitness = 58.1 ± 3.6 kg;
low fitness = 52.0 ± 1.7 kg) groups. To the best of our
knowledge other studies have not examined the relationship
of fitness and fatness with HOMA by gender in this manner.
In the final regression model, after controlling for race
and age, the relationship between insulin resistance and
VO2max was maintained in all adolescents and among boys
suggesting a greater relative importance of cardiorespiratory
fitness as a predictor of insulin resistance in boys. In
particular, this relationship remained significant only in
those boys over the 85th percentile of BMI for age and
gender, a group at higher risk for adult obesity and diabetes
mellitus. This is an important finding and suggests that
greater cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight boys leads to
biological changes in insulin and glucose metabolism that
may be protective with respect to the risk of Type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Indeed, Shaibi et al. [30] have shown that exercise in
boys can lead to marked improvement in insulin sensitivity
without changes in body composition.
By contrast, in girls no relationship between estimated
VO2max and lnHOMA was observed, regardless of BMI
group, suggesting that cardiorespiratory fitness is a less
important predictor in females. These findings support
the gender differences observed in a study by Allen et al.
[7]. They found that in boys, fitness levels had a stronger
relationship with insulin resistance than percent body fat.
Whereas, in girls, no relationship between either percent
body fat and HOMA or VO2max adjusted for lean body mass
was observed [7]. Our findings are similar to Allen et al. [7]
for the relationship between VO2max and lnHOMA among
girls even though they used a different method to estimate
percent body fat and a younger, smaller non-population-
based sample.
The observed gender differences in the current study
could be due to the differences in cardiorespiratory fitness
[17]. Differences in physical activity participation by the gen-
ders might explain why boys have higher cardiorespiratory
fitness levels than girls. Girl's physical activity participation,
especially vigorous-intensity physical activity, declines as
they age more than boys [31]. According to a recent paper
that measured physical activity levels objectively, 10%­11.9%
of boys from 12 to 19 years old are meeting current physical
activity guidelines but only 5.6%­7.6% of girls from 12 to
19 years old are meeting physical activity guidelines [31].
Differences in the relationship between cardiorespiratory
fitness and insulin resistance may also relate to the complex
and differing physiologic and psychosocial effects of puberty
in boys and girls. Girls often have a decline in VO2max in late
puberty in association with weight gain while boys frequently
have an increase in cardiovascular fitness in late puberty [32].
We have found that fitness level (VO2max) is an indepen-
dent predictor of insulin resistance in boys. Even among boys
who are overweight or obese those with the highest fitness
levels do not meet criteria for insulin resistance (HOMA >
3.26) while overweight and obese boys in the middle and
low tertiles for fitness are insulin resistant (HOMA levels
of about 3.5 and 5.0, resp.). In contrast, overweight and
obese girls are, on average, all insulin resistant, irrespective
of their fitness tertile. Girls in this study had lower fitness
levels overall than boys (39.59 ± 0.44 mL·kg-1·min-1 versus
47.4 ± 0.64 mL·kg-1·min-1, resp.). Another reason, other
than lower physical activity levels, for the lower fitness
levels in girls is due to less lean body mass (muscle mass)
than boys. Lean body mass in girls ranged from 34.5 kg to
44.2 kg, whereas in boys it was between 45.5 kg and 58.1 kg.
Therefore, differences may be due, in large part, to the higher
percentage lean body mass (muscle mass) found in boys than
in girls [33]. Even the average VO2max for the highest fitness
tertile of overweight and obese girls was lower than that
of the lowest fitness tertile for overweight and obese boys
(41.22 mL·kg-1·min-1versus 42.99 mL·kg-1·min-1, resp.).
This observation suggests that fitness levels in overweight
and obese girls, irrespective of their fitness tertile, fall
below a threshold that protects against insulin resistance
in the face of obesity. Hence all overweight and obese
girls might benefit from interventions designed not only to
reduce abdominal adiposity/waist circumference and BMI
(independent predictors of IR) but to increase fitness above
this theoretical threshold. In contrast, among overweight and
obese boys significant insulin resistance was only seen at
the lowest fitness level. Consequently, the relative value of
interventions to improve fitness in order to promote insulin
sensitivity in most overweight and obese boys requires
additional investigation to determine which boys may derive
specific benefit in terms of insulin sensitivity.
This study has some limitations; first, this was a cross-
sectional study design. Given this design it is difficult to
identify which factor developed first, insulin resistance or
obesity and thus causality cannot be determined. These data
are only applicable to children with 12 years or older, as blood
samples were not obtained from younger children. Further,
for this age group, a clinical standard for measuring insulin
resistance is lacking. While there are many different methods,
HOMA was used in this study to estimate insulin resistance.
HOMA has shown to be a valid and reliable method for
quantifying insulin resistance in adolescents [27, 34, 35]. In
addition, Tanner staging was not assessed in the NHANES
6 Journal of Obesity
testing, so a good measure of sexual development is lacking.
Therefore, adolescents of similar chronological age may have
been at different stages of puberty, resulting in variability in
measures of insulin resistance. Although not as accurate as
measures such as dual energy absorptiometry, we measured
body fatness by measures commonly used in the clinical
setting (i.e., BMI and waist circumference) to facilitate
broader applicability. Although a structured protocol and
trained measurers were utilized, there is limited information
about the exact procedures for confirming the reliability of
anthropometric measures. Finally, cardiorespiratory fitness
was estimated based on a submaximal treadmill test. While
a maximal cardiorespiratory fitness test was not conducted,
this is the largest number of adolescents in the US that have
completed aerobic fitness testing.
5. Conclusion
Among adolescents, important gender and weight category
differences exist in the relationship between insulin resis-
tance and cardiorespiratory fitness. While waist circumfer-
ence and BMI are important predictors of insulin resistance
in all children, fitness may be more important in boys,
especially overweight boys, than girls. Our results suggest
that the determination of cardiorespiratory fitness in boys,
using a safe, noninvasive submaximal exercise treadmill
test may provide additional clinically relevant information
pertaining to insulin resistance. Longitudinal studies are
needed to determine if low cardiorespiratory fitness and
associated insulin resistance, as shown here, are predictive
of higher risks for developing Type 2 diabetes. If so, early
determination of cardiorespiratory fitness could help guide
not only who is in most need of intervention but also the
nature of the interventions offered.
