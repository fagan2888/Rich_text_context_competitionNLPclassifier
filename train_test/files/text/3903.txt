Introduction
Traditionally, a scientific journal will publish an article if the
offered manuscript is evaluated as having a sufficiently high
level of quality, that is, all manuscripts of quality are pub-
lished. This principle is probably no more valid. A political
demand that research should be freely available on the
Internet, namely, Open Access, has been created in connec-
tion with digital publishing. There had been an intense dis-
cussion of how free access would be financed when
subscription payments are abolished. Furthermore, there has
been consensus that free access to research should not be at
the expense of quality. Therefore, development of sustain-
able publishing models is sought.
Two of the three dominant Open Access models will not
be discussed here: In the first model, called Green Open
Access, authors self-archive their own articles. The existing
form of publishing is retained, and subsequently each author
makes his article available in an open archive. The second
model, Delayed Open Access, retains subscriptions while
delaying open access for a period, so the publishing com-
pany can manage to generate revenue to cover its expenses.
Neither of these two models is optimal, as there will not
be immediate access to the originally published articles, and
it is questionable whether the business principles are sustain-
able in the long run.
The third model, called Gold Open Access, is based on
paid release. In most cases, the authors have to pay an article
processing charge (APC) to have their research published.
The model does not have the other two models'drawbacks--
articles are published immediately after the authors pay their
contribution. There is genuine free access.
It has long been debated whether this publishing form
would be economically viable (Bergstrom & Bergstrom,
2004), but after a few years of application, publishers such as
Public Library of Science (PLoS), BioMed Central, and oth-
ers have shown that free magazines can be among the world's
top ranked and still be economically viable (King &
Alvarado-Albertorio, 2008; Solomon, 2013).
Thus, there has been a noticeable change of attitude
toward Gold Open Access. Commercial publishers have
stopped their resistance, and even the world's largest pub-
lishers have begun to publish journals based on author pay-
ment. Politically, there is also growing support. Based on a
report by the Finch committee, the Government of Great
Britain supported an Open Access policy based on author
payment (Finch, 2012).
However, the author-funded publishing model has a type
of built-in system failure that prevents research from being

Researchers Outside APC-Financed Open
Access: Implications for Scholars Without
a Paying Institution
Jørgen Burchardt1
Abstract
The article processing charge (APC) financed Open Access is a publication model that provides immediate and free access
to scientific articles. More than half of the world's Open Access articles are published according to this concept. However, a
side effect of the model is that research is not published if researchers cannot pay the publication charge. The study examines
the nature of this phenomenon, its extent, and implications. The study places a special focus on authors who are not affiliated
with a research institution. The proportion of these authors is identified among 2,184 Danish authors in Danish periodicals
in 2010. The possibility for poor researchers to receive compensation from publishers is investigated as well. Paying the
APC is a problem for many researchers--represented by around 30% of authors who have published in Danish journals
(unemployed scientists, students, as well as retired and private employees). Grants from publishers exist, but they are small
and too uncertain to ensure that research is published optimally. This study predicts that a large amount of valuable research
risks not being published if this publishing model dominates without alternatives or countermeasures.

published if researchers or their institutions cannot afford to
pay. It is a well-known problem that authors from the poorest
developing countries cannot pay even though some publish-
ers have introduced a policy to compensate them partly or in
whole.
Even in the wealthiest countries, authors can have prob-
lems paying this fee. This study focuses on one such group:
the researchers without an institution behind them to pay for
their publishing.
APC-based publishing is indeed sustainable for individ-
ual journals, but the issue is about whether the publishing
form is also sustainable when we consider science from the
perspective of the big picture. Is it sufficient to have all
research of value published, as the traditional subscriber-
based publishing model could deliver? This study will pro-
vide evidence of a potential large problem.
APC Financing
It is not quite new that authors have paid to have their research
published. In the 1930s, individual journals collected a fee
from authors to reduce the price of the subscription (Curb &
Abramson, 2012; King & Alvarado-Albertorio, 2008). In
1965, the U.S. government gave official permission to use
federal funds for fee waivers. King and colleagues (King &
Alvarado-Albertorio, 2008; King, McDonald, & Roderer,
1981) state that more than 50% of articles in science in the
1970s were published with some form of author payment.
One paid if you wanted an illustration in color or if the article
was above a certain maximum length. There are no state-
ments from humanities, social sciences, and other areas out-
side science, but the proportion was probably extremely low.
It was mainly company-owned journals that charged extra
fees, opposed to society-owned journals. Commercial pub-
lishers' journals were funded by subscription payments, and
during the 1970s, many researchers preferred to publish for
free in these journals.
In his overview of Open Access, Solomon (2012)
describes how the commercial publisher BioMed Central
published its first free article in 2000. Its publishing based on
APC made the publisher so profitable that in 2008, it was
sold to a leading commercial publisher, Springer Verlag. In
2011, 512 publishing houses published 1,825 journals, with a
total of 76,000 Open Access articles (Björk & Solomon,
2012), which was almost half of all Open Access articles,
and with the continued surge, probably well more than half
of Open Access articles today belong to this category of
Open Access (Laakso & Björk, 2012).
The level of APC varies widely among journals. Some
journals have sufficient external financing and they do not
charge APC at all or ask only for a very small amount. An
average stands at just over $900 (Björk & Solomon, 2012) or
$1,000 to $3,000 (Ware & Mabe, 2012). In contrast, large
and prestigious journals with a high impact factor are expen-
sive, up to $3,900 in 2010 (Björk & Solomon, 2012). There
was an increase of 10% in the average APC in a selected
sample between 2011 and 2013 (Björk & Solomon, 2014).
However, there are many other payment structures; for
example, institutions may pay a lump sum to cover the pub-
lishing of all their researchers' works, as is done by the
world's largest Open Access publisher BioMed Central.
However, other publishers require a payment to have a man-
uscript judged, and perhaps the author must also pay extra
for a subsequent linguistic correction.
Researchers want to publish in the best journals and are,
therefore, willing to pay an extra large amount to gain higher
visibility and recognition. Publishers behind the APC-based
publishing model, therefore, attach considerable importance
to marketing themselves to authors, in contrast to the tradi-
tional publishers, whose marketing is targeted at users (Björk
& Solomon, 2012).
APC System Weaknesses
Initially, it was discussed that the publishing method could
have negative consequences. An Organisation for Economic
Co-Operation and Development (OECD) report (Houghton
& Vickery, 2005, pp. 63-65) outlined a number of potential
disadvantages when publishing required a payment:
·
· There will be an even greater disparity between
researchers. It was already established that research-
ers with large research were more advanced than
researchers outside, and the difference will be
strengthened to the detriment of unknown and young
researchers.
·
· It may not work in large areas of the humanities, arts,
and social sciences with funding limitations.
·
· It may be difficult to operate in areas with a high num-
ber of rejected manuscripts, as the authors of the few
recorded additional articles would have to pay the edi-
torial costs of rejected manuscripts.
·
· It would lead to researchers publishing less.
·
· There would be a shift in the published articles
because scholars in some research directions would
find it easier to raise money than others.
·
· Researchers in developing countries would not have
access to publishing.
Liyanage and Raina MacIntyre (2006) explained the
problems by distinguishing between multiple types of
authors; author-paid publishing is not suitable for research-
ers early in their careers, researchers employed in govern-
ment offices or agencies that do not pay for the employees'
publications, or researchers whose research is not funded by
the pharmaceutical industry.
The publishing principle may also seem unfair, as
research-intensive universities would face an extra financial
burden in comparison with more teaching-oriented universi-
ties and highly applied areas, interrupting the business to
Burchardt 3
fund most of the cost. Similarly, some countries would pay
more than other "free rider" countries that could benefit from
research without having to pay. For example, the United
Kingdom pays about 3.3% of the world's costs of journal
subscriptions but accounts for 5% of the world's research
(The Science and Technology Department, 2004), and a
report from the Research Information Network (Hulls,
Rennison, & Rattensperger, 2008) indicates that the United
Kingdom produces as much as 6.6% of the world's research.
Developing countries' problems are addressed by Papin-
Ramcharan and Dawe (2006), who conclude that APC will
certainly exclude less fortunate researchers from publishing
in Open Access journals. It is true that several publishers
offer support, but the articles state that often the publication
will be delayed and aid funds may be limited. In general,
many researchers are not on an equal footing with their peers
in more economically advantaged parts of the world.
Apparently, politicians believe that research funding from
foundations also has to include payment of theAPC. This has
been implemented in the guidelines for many research coun-
cils, including Horizon 2020 in the European Union (EU).
The British House of Commons stated in a 2004 report (The
Science and Technology Committee, 2004) that payment
should not depend on a researcher's personal financial situa-
tion; it should not even be his or her institution's responsibil-
ity: "We believe that such funding should originate with the
research funder, not the institution. By that payment would
be included in the total research funding, this would facilitate
effective planning and budgeting" (p. 78).
However, not even one of the richest areas of research,
medicine, could have the entire fund paid through these
funds (Schroter, Tite, & Kassem, 2006). The study showed
that only 41% of externally funded researchers had money
available at the time their manuscript was accepted for pub-
lication. This was because the project accounts were closed
before they should be published, or--if the project was still
running--sufficient funds for publishing were not allocated.
The conclusion was that the author payment would probably
prevent research from being published.
Graczyski and Moses (2004) have the same doubt that
planning and budgeting should be able to predict the
resources required for publication. Sometimes, a promising
project may not carry enough useful knowledge and thus
may not utilize the funds allocated for publishing, while
other projects and highly productive researchers could pro-
duce a large series of interesting articles. Neither research
councils nor, for that matter, university departments can pre-
dict researchers' future production capability.
Several studies have been conducted on researchers' atti-
tudes toward Open Access. Unfortunately, most are based on
extremely low response rates, so their results are not statisti-
cally valid, and therefore they will not be mentioned here.
Solomon and Björk (2012a) show how researchers spe-
cifically funded their APC in various disciplines (Table 1).
Their survey shows a big difference in the authors'
opportunities. Research council funding is more common in
the life sciences and physical sciences than in the social sci-
ences and humanities (the same conclusion was reached by
Curb & Abramson, 2012). Thus, 46% of the scientists in
business and economics pay for publishing, whereas 10%
got the publisher to waive the charges.
Articles in the best journals were often funded by research
council's funds or with the support of institutions. By con-
trast, the proportion of self-payers was greater in lower-
ranked journals with a lower rate of APC. This suggests that
if you have funds from a research council, you can publish in
the best journals, and if you do not have such funds, you have
to choose a cheaper journal.
It should be noted that the study has only involved
researchers who could raise funds. When the authors were
asked about the maximum APC, they will pay, on average,
$649. One must consider that the amount would have been
much lower if also the researchers who had not published
were asked.
For comparison, Halsted (2003) believes that it would be
impossible for poorer researchers to finance an APC of
$1,500; although even researchers employed by U.S. govern-
ment institutions would not be able to obtain a grant of this
size.
Researchers from poor countries have often had to finance
their research themselves; in fact, the entire 39% of research
is self-funded, including 14% of the research is published
after remission of APC compared with, surprisingly, a
respective 11% and 12% in more affluent countries (Solomon
& Björk, 2012a).
Liyanage and Raina MacIntyre's (2006) study of spon-
sorship and payment of APC showed a clear link between
industry funding and type of published research. They found
that the payment model would certainly affect the published
research nature, when the author payment favored strong
organizations, industry sponsored research, and prosperous
countries.
The majority of the published research from universities
is basically not financed by external funds. According to
King and Tenopir (2004), the universities funded $30 billion
of the research that led to the publication, with $5.8 billion

from federal grants for research on university institutions,
and $10 to $15 billion conducted elsewhere.
Even a rich field of research, such as medicine, has disci-
plines with a small proportion of externally funded research
(Berman, Borkowski, Rachocka, & Moore, 1995; Ernst
et al., 1997; Stein, Rubenstein, & Wachtel, 1993; Silberman,
& Snyderman, 1997). According Dewan, et al. (1999) were
25% research unfunded in psychiatry. Especially, important
basic research is not funded by external funds (Schroter, Tite,
& Smith, 2005). The publishing model could also cause
problems in countries with little public funding. For exam-
ple, only 10% of research in Japan and Switzerland is sup-
ported by public funds (Worlock, 2004).
Method
This study mainly focuses on identifying a special group of
researchers that are unaffiliated with a research institution
and have no institutional funding to pay the APC for their
research. These researchers "without a research institution"
are not employed at an institution that expects research from
them. They either have no work (i.e., they are unemployed)
or they work in an institution where research is not expected
of them.
There is a great interest in research due to its social value.
However, the statistical reports do not include researchers
outside research institutions. Most countries use the OECD
definitions, as described in the Frascati Manual (OECD,
2002) and Canberra Manual (OECD, 1995). Neither of these
manuals recognizes the existence of researchers outside
institutions. The statistics are imperfect. Only an empirical
investigation can shed light on this phenomenon and its
extent.
To judge the impact of researchers not having support
from a research institution, this study investigates publishers'
policy of compensating for missing funding by giving the
authors a waiver (see Table 2).
Analysis of Journals
To identify researchers without connection with a research
institution, Danish scientific journals were reviewed for a
single year. All issues of each of the journals were obtained
and analyzed. For each article, the author(s) were identified,
and their employment situation was subsequently studied.
The study was limited to include only articles from Danish
researchers. This was convenient, as it is assumed to be eas-
ier to identify Danes. Danish research institutions have very
detailed information about their employees not found at all
universities and institutions worldwide.
Danish journals are defined as journals published in
Denmark and/or with a high percent of Danish authors--on
average, more than 50% Danish authors. They are often pub-
lished in Danish, but they also have an increasing number of
articles in English. It would not have been feasible to per-
form the same intense analysis with international journals.
The number of journals would have been very large, and
each journal would have had a very small proportion of
Danish researchers.
The year 2010 was chosen because it is very close to the
present, and therefore gives a picture of the current situation.
At the same time, it is assumed that the various databases and
websites are reasonably updated, so that information about
most of the 2010 magazines was available when the study
was conducted.
The contents of 110 journals were examined, resulting in
the identification of 2,221 scientists who were authors of
1,386 articles (see Table 3). The analyzed journals are all of
the highest scientific quality as they are included in the list of
approved professional journals published by the Danish
Agency for Science, Technology, and Innovation under the
Ministry of Higher Education and Science. This list is pro-
duced by the country's leading researchers to give an indica-
tion of the distribution of research funds. The list covers the
best research journals in the world as a resource for research-
ers seeking to publish in quality publications. The list for
2012-2013 was used for this study.
Of the 208 identified Danish journals on the list, a little
more than half were investigated. To make the work manage-
able, only those journals that allowed easy access for the
evaluation and within a reasonable time were selected. A few
journals did not publish issues in 2010 and several had no
Danish authors. Priority was given to the remaining journals,
and journals were selected that had been identified by
Burchardt's (2007a) work and the inventory of Danish jour-
nals (Burchardt, 2007b) as journals with the highest scien-
tific quality.
The journals included a variety of publishing models,
including subscriber-based journals and Gold Open Access
completely sponsored by institutions; only the APC-funded
journal model was not represented.
It was decided to include only authors of genuine research
papers. This apparently clear concept appeared in the real
world to be more complicated, because it was necessary to
judge whether a contribution was an article. The journals
themselves did not always mention whether a contribution
was a peer-reviewed article or a less valuable writing. There
is a subjective estimate underlying the assessment, and
although the author of the study is a long-standing editor, it
required a closer reading of both the article and often another
substance in the journal to determine whether a contribution
rose up to the level of quality as an article in the particular
academic field should have.
The Author's Real Affiliation
Often, journals give an indication of the article authors'posi-
tion and institutional affiliation. This information was widely
used in the study. Frequently, the information was checked
due to the long publishing process, which in some cases
showed that an alleged employment at the time of publica-
tion was incorrect. Following the assessment of people's
Burchardt 5
relationships, journal publishing should be considered as a
typically long process. In general, publication of a manu-
script is often a year long, from its first time submission to its
acceptance. If the author was employed at the time of filing
in December 2008, this appointment could have expired
when the article was accepted and published in the spring of
2010.
To control this information, this study used the Danish
National Research Database that is based on information
from universities. This database was supplemented by virtu-
ally all local databases from the universities. In total, they
provided information on 55% of the researchers.
For practical reasons, the employment situation of these
more than 1,000 people has not been further investigated. It
is assumed that when they are included in a university data-
base, they have had a more or less permanent attachment to
the institution. Sample checks have shown some examples of
"researchers outside research institutions" among those who
are registered as affiliated with a university, but the number
is considered so small that it would not affect the main result.
This is specifically a portion of students who are registered
as employees, and at the same time, administrative staff and
others without proper research duties were included in the
databases as well.
Where the biographical information in a journal did not
show an association with a research institution at a univer-
sity, private company, or another organization and no univer-
sity was listed as the researcher's place of employment, it
was presumed that there was no such connection; a link to a

research institution in the scientific community is highly
desirable, and it was assumed that any connection would
have been mentioned. In these cases, the authors were unem-
ployed, students, retired, or employed at an institution with-
out research duties; their placement between the categories
was performed to the best estimate.
The researchers' employment statuses were identified
through various sources. In this phase, the Internet was an
invaluable source, where especially LinkedIn, Facebook,
and personal websites were seen as credible sources. In these
social networking sites, friends and acquaintances would
quickly reveal obvious misinformation, and thus the margin
of errors was assumed to be minimal. The information was
often outdated, but it was generally easy to identify informa-
tion about the situation in 2010.
Some cases were supplemented by information obtained
from the authors themselves or from the journal their article
was published in.
A general problem around many of the researchers was
investigating whether they had a reasonably close connec-
tion with a research institution. Should a temporary teacher
with a few hours of training per year be regarded as a univer-
sity employee? What affiliations did a lecturer with a pri-
vately owned company have?
In principle, temporary teachers are not paid for research,
and should therefore not be included in the measure of
researchers at universities. As mentioned, information from
the universities' own databases was used, and part-time
teachers were often erroneously included in the inventory of
university-based researchers.
Generally, the persons associations with the labor market
in 2010 were studied, and if they were deemed to have at
least half-time employment at a research institution, they
were included. There were many doubts, and generally, the
assessment was conservative.
Investigation of the Publishers' Waiver Policy
A supplementary investigation was conducted to speculate
the actual situation for individual researchers to have their
articles published without having to pay the APC.
The world's most important publishers with businesses
based on APC-financed publishing were asked in the spring
of 2013. A standard mail was sent to all the publishers with
questions about how the publisher would handle an applica-
tion. A specification of different situations for researchers
was included. Some of the publishers did not respond, and
therefore their responses were collected from information on
their websites.
The selection of the 27 largest publishers (see Table 2) was
based on the study conducted by Solomon and Björk (2012b).
Results
The examination of the Danish journals revealed a number of
researchers outside research institutions. Based on close
examination, these researchers were divided into various cat-
egories. The study will analyze these groups and what drives
their research (see Table 4).
The Retired
Pensioners represent 7% of those without an institution.
They are scientists of their own volition, often without any
reward or hope of future personal benefit. The pensioners'
share seems to be a substantial part, but if the figure is put up
to the total number of pensioners, there is actually a remark-
ably small number of people conducting research in their
retirement age. The number is still so high that one can only
say that these retirees make a significant contribution to
research.
Pensioners can be divided into two groups. The research-
ers in the largest group were employed as scientists in their
past work, and they still care about their research areas.
The Unemployed
The professionals are clearly the majority in this group, com-
pared with the self-taught. The unemployed are virtually all
researchers or future researchers.
The groups' share is just less than 8%. The percentage is
probably somewhat higher, because it is not desirable to be
known as unemployed, so researchers often indicate a differ-
ent employment situation, if the opportunity is available. The
unemployed provide a significant contribution of relevant
research for society. Their proportion fits nicely into the
overall unemployment rate, which at that time, according to
Eurostat statistics, was on average 7.6% (March 2010).
In a dynamic labor market for researchers, greater periods
of unemployment from a job occur when a research project
ends before the next one begins, so these unemployment
rates may be natural. Mobility, especially for the highly edu-
cated, is remarkably high. Graversen (2002) indicates that
30% of researchers at public research institutions change
jobs every year.
The Students
One of the major groups is students who publish the results
they collected during their studies. Fifteen percent of
Burchardt 7
researchers without institutions fall into this category. Of
these, the vast majority is PhD students, but students at lower
levels also publish research findings.
The number of students publishing is not particularly high
compared with the approximately 6,000 current PhD stu-
dents, of whom 2,000 graduate each year. Their research is
still so large that it is a community resource of significant
size and value.
It was difficult to determine whether a student's article
was submitted for publication while he was still a student or
whether it was submitted after the final exam. Nevertheless,
we note that research institutions mostly do not recognize
student research. Only a small number of students are con-
sidered participants in their institution's research, and there-
fore they are recorded in the databases of research from the
institution in the annual report or otherwise.
Employees of Non-Research Institutions
The largest group of researchers outside research institutions
comprises those at the many private and public institutions.
Seventy percent of researchers without institutions are found
in this very diverse group. There are employees of both large/
small and private/public companies, and with many different
types of contracts.
Approximately, one fourth of the researchers in this group
own their own firms. These are typical consulting firms
where the holder delivers services. Research is not primarily
conducted for benefits, but the holder occasionally works
closely with researchers and sometimes conducts research in
this context. For example, there are several journalists who
provide consulting services with communication functions
for clients. The consultant then uses his acquired knowledge
to write a scientific article. These companies, especially,
need to show "seriousness," and it cannot be excluded that an
acquired advertising effect helps to explain the owner's
interest in publishing.
A portion of the employee's research is unrelated to the
company's activities. This research is the employee's own
research agenda. It may, for example, be a bank agent pro-
viding historical literature. The company draws only limited
usefulness from the research, and activities are assumed to
be performed at the employee's leisure.
In the remaining companies, the research topics are partly
or wholly related to the company's activities. An employee
can conduct his research because it allows him to gain insight
into topics he deals with at work, and he may even be given
time to conduct the research during work hours.
Much research deals with the institution's primary activ-
ity. The starting point is the daily practice where experience
is summarized in a scientific article. It could be a judge in a
court in Greenland who writes an article on the evolution of
the Greenland justice, or the bank manager in a large bank
who contributes with an article on current monetary and
credit developments in the crisis.
Publishers' Waiver Policy
The statement from the world's 27 largest Open Access pub-
lishers reveals through our questionnaires that only four will
automatically waive the APC for authors from the poorest
developing countries, as identified in the World Bank classifi-
cation of countries. Half of the publishers indicate that you can
apply to have the APC waived. No publisher automatically
gives a waiver to the unemployed, pensioners, and so on.
There is no transparency about the number of applications,
and the publisher's policy can be changed without the public's
awareness. One might assume that the proportion of refusals
would be high in areas with many poor scholars. Several pub-
lishers claim no connection between the editorial office and
the people judging the waiving. However, in a questionnaire
response, one publisher wrote that it "gives discount according
to the quality of the paper and the academic background of the
author, rather than the country of the author." For this com-
pany, it is business; they award discounts on low-quality arti-
cles from rich countries but refuse to support articles of the
same quality from low-income countries.
The publishers'secrets about their administration of waiv-
ers suggest that it is not possible to examine to what extent
publishers have exempted writers from paying APC, but it is
assumed to be a relatively small portion; thus, PLoS should
have a level of less than 10% (Ware & Mabe, 2012). Ten
percent is the level Copernicus Publications supposedly sets
aside in the budget for subsidies, and 13% is the number
obtained from a sample of journals (Salomon & Björk,
2012a, 2013).
Discussion
Today, sustainable publishing houses manage quality publi-
cations based on APC financing. Even the largest commer-
cial publishers have come to stay, and it will be interesting to
follow where the levels of APC will stabilize.
It seems that OpenAccess is here to stay, as Solomon (2013)
states, "It enjoys broad-based support and it is easy to sell polit-
ically" (p.28). Much of the development is due to public poli-
tics. Different initiatives have, in recent years, deemed the
market forces ineffective. So far, public research councils
require fast OpenAccess, and thereby indirectly direct research
funds to replace the existing subscription revenue, even though
one could imagine that the traditionally independent universi-
ties would oppose similar reductions in research funding in the
order of, say, 2% to 5% to finance the APC.
The business model is certainly mature. Perhaps it is
approaching the soaring upward curve, as found in tradi-
tional innovation processes, as Solomon and Björk (2012a)
predict. They estimate, however, that the precondition is that
researchers do not oppose payment: "Author attitudes toward
paying the required APCs and their ability to obtain funding,
balanced against the quality of the service they experience
will determine . . . the future" (p. 105).

Note. The table indicates the different types of researchers with potential problems in paying the APC for publishing. APC = article processing charge.
This claim can be accepted only if researchers' resistance
at the same time has a political expression. If researchers--
even in large numbers--simply fail to publish in author-
financed journals, this publishing model could easily
continue with great success. If the poorest, say, 40% of sci-
entists could not pay, would the APC-based publishing still
be a commercial success, where the 60% pay a contribution
so high that the journals can afford to compensate around
10% of poor researchers publishing?
In particular, the questionnaire responses indicate that
researchers without funds cannot be sure of having their
research published in an author-paid journal. They might
apply to some publishers, but half of the publishers do not
waive the APC at all. Only four publishers provide automatic
support for researchers in poor countries.
The problem with the developing countries few resources
for subscription-based journals attempted remedies in the
form of adoption of schemes such as the Health InterNetwork
Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) project of the World
Health Organization (WHO), where publishers deliver mag-
azines for free or at very reduced prices for countries with a
minimal per capita income (SQW, 2004). It is debatable
whether publishers will have the same opportunity to refrain
from APC revenue. The lower income countries have notori-
ously very few resources to pay for subscriptions, while pub-
lishers do not lose anything by providing free digital access.
In contrast, the publishers have unfunded costs if they have
to waive an APC.
There are probably very few articles from the "low-
income economy" countries because they barely reach 0.53%
of the world's publications, according to a count for 2009
from the statistics released by the National Science Board
(2012). More significant is that the second-largest publisher,
PLoS, automatically charges a reduced fee for low-income
countries such as India, Pakistan, and others whose scientific
production is much greater.
For the Gold Open Access publishing model, however, one
should consider that these companies mostly publish journals
in the richest areas of science. An automatic rule for compen-
sation may not be feasible in less wealthy areas of research.
If the author-paid publishing model were dominant, its
built-in system failures would mean less published research.
Even if countermeasures were to be implemented, as dis-
cussed later, a large proportion of research would probably
not be published.
In general, the author-paid model discriminates against all
authors with little access to funding. This will certainly affect
the publishing by researchers without a research institution
behind them. This group is of special interest because its
members probably can no longer have their research pub-
lished in Gold OpenAccess journals, as there is no institution
to pay for them. Very few parishes or high schools will pay
for their employees (e.g., priest, teacher) to publish research.
It is obvious that it would be unthinkable for most retired
people, the unemployed, or students themselves to pay for
having their research published. Just the payment for two
articles in top journals in one year would be a financial strain
for most (Table 5).
The research shows that around 30% of authors in Danish
journals are without a research institution behind them. The
result is based on statistics for one single year, 2010, but
nothing indicates a difference from other years. Some indi-
vidual journals have a very different publishing profile every
year, but with many journals in the sample this should be of
minor importance. The largest journals are in medicine,
which does not have these shifts in editorial practice.
The sample did not include all the Danish journals, but
nothing indicates that the missing journals should have quite
another profile.
The interpretation of the status of each researcher is based
on qualitative judgments, and this method obviously does not
yield a 100% accurate result. Furthermore, as mentioned, this
study used information from the universities, where the infor-
mation was known to include researchers with only a very
weak relation to the university; the universities would certainly
not pay for all those researchers to publish if they were asked.
Generally, the uncertainty was relatively high for which
group a researcher belonged to ("students," "unemployed,"
"retired," or "employed in an institution without research
support"). The greatest uncertainty existed in the distribution
of employment types in self-owned firms, and public or pri-
vate institutions. The single calculated percentages should be
treated with caution. However, there was reasonable cer-
tainty of whether a person was at a research institution.
There is a possible recent development that can explain
some of the phenomenon of researchers without institutions.
The labor market is changing rapidly, and many more
employees have a very loose connection with their work-
place. In the new networked economy, researchers can work
for several institutions. Simultaneously, increased mobility
Burchardt 9
implies that researchers often have only a few years at a
research institution, when the duration of many grants is just
1 to 3 years, and then the researcher is often transferred to
another institute.
The development is similar for students. They are forced
to work in international, cross-institutional cooperation, and
as a result, they fail to form a strong connection with any
single institution.
The study is, to a large extent, based on such qualitative
judgments and has the normal problems that occur within
this tradition of research. In spite of the known problem that
people provide false statements, at this instance claiming that
they have a connection with a research institution, the study
attempted to control these statements through different meth-
ods and sources.
Probably, the percentage of researchers without a research
institution is larger than the mentioned 30%, but the number
itself is not that important. The phenomenon of a large
amount of research not being published is the most important
message of the study.
The percentage of researchers in non-Danish journals
who are without an institution has not been investigated.
Random selections of those journals have shown the same
kind of authors. Probably, the percentage of such authors in
nationally and regionally oriented journals is larger than in
international ones. One could imagine that the regional/
national journals have better contact with and knowledge of
all potential authors, and therefore can include experience
from researchers outside the traditional research institutions;
further studies should investigate this distribution. This study
has shown the existence of a potential problem.
Not all researchers outside research institutions would
have problems with the APC-based publishing model. Some
can have their institution pay for them. In some cases, a com-
pany might pay the fee for publishing when it will directly
benefit from an employee's published research. One must
assume that the work is often performed during working
hours and with the institution's consent. The institution may
have two quite different interests in allowing employees' to
conduct research. It may be that the research will help to
develop knowledge about the area, and thereby indirectly
renew the institution. This is the case with the Greenland
legal system, and probably also in part with the bank man-
ager's contribution. Another large institution-related interest
behind scientific activity lies in public relations. It is certain
that the bank director's article shows the bank's seriousness
in having a scientific paper accepted and helps to promote
the bank as one of the country's leading financial institu-
tions. The article should be read by journalists and should
highlight the institution.
The gain for a company should be very visible, as an APC
for most firms is a significant and extraneous amount, but
this is estimated to be a possibility only for a minor percent-
age of the authors.
The problem with lost research from this group is not the
only consequence of the publishing model. As shown in the
literature, there would also be a loss of university research
from less wealthy universities and research institutions and,
of course, typically from researchers in a weak power situa-
tion. Young people would find it difficult to break through,
the growing number of researchers with a non-permanent
relation to an institution would have problems with the mod-
ern co-operative networks working on cross-words without
belonging to a single institution, and finally innovative and
controversial research would probably find it difficult to
penetrate.
It is feared that under the new Open Access publishing
system, students and part-time employees whose research is
currently part of universities' official statistics would no lon-
ger be considered as a part of the university's research staff if
the university pays for their research. Publication of an arti-
cle from a student is going to compete with the head of
department's trip abroad, so to speak.
Even funded research will be difficult to publish.Although
scientists should be better able to manage their budgeting
than when Schroter et al. (2006) conducted their study, there
will still be a problem for the very productive researchers
with late manuscripts (which is not very uncommon).
If the author-paid publishing model just gets a fair spread,
there will, for most researchers, no longer be the freedom to
choose the best journals for their articles. The best journals
would often also be the most desirable but with a high level
of the APC. Researchers would find themselves with limited
resources. The implication for researchers basically is a loss
of academic freedom. They will be forced to publish in jour-
nals that do not treat their manuscripts optimally. The fin-
ished articles, thus, may have lower quality than articles
published under the previous subscription-based model,
where top journals printed all the best manuscripts.
It is quite certain that there must be sharp adjustments
before the author-paid publishing model can cater to all
requirements in the scientific world. Establishing funds to
compensate is one solution, but this would necessitate new
routines and decision-making processes. This would affect
all researchers. Only extremely rich project researchers
would be able to send their manuscripts to all journals,
including the best and most expensive. The new funds would
probably be limited, so priorities would have to be set.
Universities are interested in supporting their researchers'
publishing, and local university publishing funds are proba-
ble to appear in the coming years. Universities compete with
each other for positions in the various rankings, and here the
total impact factor is an important parameter. It will initially
be seen at universities with a high proportion of scientific,
technical and medical (STM) research, where one can use
the Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports and similar
measuring tools that cannot be used in book-oriented areas
such as humanities and social sciences (HSS).
Power relations at universities and similar research insti-
tutions are also certainly changing. It is no longer (only) the
academic norms, habits, and good practice in the scientific
world that will be responsible, but now (paying
10 SAGE Open
for) publishing will be determined by economics, which is
controlled in a hierarchical system. The decision on publish-
ing will be taken by intruders.
Researchers with no institutional affiliation will be in the
worst situation. There will possibly be general funding
opportunities established where one can apply, but the same
problem with unauthorized decision makers also will exist.
Furthermore, publishers also will be interested in support-
ing researchers without funding so they do not miss good
manuscripts, and several have established internal funds as
seen from the questionnaire. However, there is no assurance
that the best manuscripts will be selected when there alleg-
edly is no connection between the professional assessment
and the aid. Only researchers from the poorest countries can,
in a few publishing houses, be sure to receive support.
The problems with financing could be solved with a 100%
automatic funding from the (over) state/federal side
(Burchardt, 2011; King & Alvarado-Albertorio, 2008). This
would allow all items to be funded, and no authors, institu-
tions, or research councils would be burdened with paying. It
would also make it easier for publishers who only had to
send bills to one place. This idealistic approach is unfortu-
nately not probable. It can be assumed that the brute market
power will make a new publishing world with a privileged
group of researchers at rich institutions and/or within rich
research areas that can publish in the world's top--and APC-
financed--journals. A large group of "proletarian" research-
ers had to publish in free, lower quality journals that were not
optimal for their manuscripts. Their chances of receiving
external funds will be reduced compared with the more rec-
ognized researchers in the privileged group. The polarization
gap will continue to grow.
Conclusion and Perspectives
The study shows that APC-financed publishing is a commer-
cial success already covering more than half of all the pub-
lished Open Access articles. This model can, due to political
support, be the dominant publishing form and probably have
a monopoly on publishing within many scientific areas.
Unfortunately, it has a type of built-in system failure that
prevents research from being published. The study shows
that up to 30% of Danish researchers in Danish journals
would have problems having their research published in
APC-based journals, because they have no research institu-
tion behind them to pay. Other studies have shown that many
other researchers risk not having their research published
even when they have an affiliation to a research institution.
It would be difficult to specify the size of the lost research,
but without further research in this area, no one knows if
there will be a loss of 5%, 25%, or 40%. Without counterac-
tion, there will surely be a considerable loss of societal value.
This is the visible drawback. In addition, there is an invis-
ible change in the nature of the research world itself when we
no more have the principle that all quality manuscripts are
published in the best journals. There is a danger that
intruders to academic quality will decide whether an article
is published. Another danger is polarization among the group
of researchers between lucky star researchers at rich institu-
tions and a proletariat of researchers without accesses to the
best journals, and thereby the necessary reputation behind
further financing of their research.
In view of the large potential drawbacks, there is actually
very little research in this area. One can understand that com-
mercial companies exploit revenue opportunities in a new
form of publishing without considering in detail the societal
implications. The same indifference could seem surprising
for politicians and public administrators.
The development in this area needs to be carefully sur-
veyed. Continued research should discuss compensations
that have no side effects on the researchers' world and the
quality of published material. Probably, it should be investi-
gated how less harmful Open Access publishing models like
the Green Open Access or central-funded journals could
serve an alternative.
The area needs a high priority. If it is true that a very
large number of researchers stand outside a potential domi-
nating publishing model and the quality of their published
research will deteriorate, it will not only be a problem for
individual researchers but also indirectly for the world
economy.
