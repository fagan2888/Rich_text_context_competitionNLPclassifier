Context There is growing concern regarding the quality of health care available in
the United States for young children, and specific limitations have been noted in de-
velopmental and behavioral services provided for children in the first 3 years of life.
Objective To determine the impact of the Healthy Steps for Young Children Pro-
gram on quality of early childhood health care and parenting practices.
Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective controlled clinical trial enrolling par-
ticipants between September 1996 and November 1998 at 6 randomization and 9 quasi-
experimental sites across the United States. Participants were 5565 children enrolled
at birth and followed up through age 3 years.
Intervention Incorporation of developmental specialists and enhanced develop-
mental services into pediatric care in participants' first 3 years of life.
Main Outcome Measures Quality of care was operationalized across 4 domains:
effectiveness (eg, families received 4 Healthy Steps­related services or discussed 6
anticipatory guidance topics), patient-centeredness (eg, families were satisfied with
care provided), timeliness (eg, children received timely well-child visits and vaccinations),
and efficiency (eg, families remained at the practice for 20 months). Parenting out-
comes included response to child misbehavior (eg, use of severe discipline) and prac-
tices to promote child development and safety (eg, mothers at risk for depression dis-
cussed their sadness with someone at the practice).
Results Of the 5565 enrolled families, 3737 (67.2%) responded to an interview at 30
to 33 months (usual care, 1716 families; Healthy Steps, 2021 families). Families who par-
ticipated in the Healthy Steps Program had greater odds of receiving 4 or more Healthy
Steps­related services (for randomization and quasi-experimental sites, respectively: odds
ratio [OR], 16.90 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 12.78 to 22.34] and OR, 23.05 [95%
CI, 17.38 to 30.58]), of discussing more than 6 anticipatory guidance topics (OR, 8.56
[95% CI, 6.47 to 11.32] and OR, 12.31 [95% CI, 9.35 to 16.19]), of being highly sat-
isfied with care provided (eg, someone in the practice went out of the way for them) (OR,
2.06 [95% CI, 1.64 to 2.58] and OR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.72 to 2.59]), of receiving timely
well-child visits and vaccinations (eg, age-appropriate 1-month visit) (OR, 1.98 [95% CI,
1.08 to 3.62] and OR, 2.11 [95% CI, 1.16 to 3.85]), and of remaining at the practice for
20 months or longer (OR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.61 to 2.55] and OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.43 to
2.15]).Theyalsohadreducedoddsofusingseverediscipline(eg,slappinginfaceorspank-
ing with object) (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.26] and OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.97]).
Among mothers considered at risk for depression, those who participated in the Healthy
Steps Program had greater odds of discussing their sadness with someone at the practice
(OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.63] and OR, 2.82 [95% CI, 1.57 to 5.08]).
Conclusion Universal, practice-based interventions can enhance quality of care for
families of young children and can improve selected parenting practices.

wanted more information about these
topics.4 In a survey of 1900 Medicaid-
enrolled children ages 4 years and
younger, 40% of parents reported that
their child's clinicians did not ask
whether they had concerns about their
child's development and well-being.10
Using the National Survey of Early
Childhood Health, Halfon et al6 re-
ported that 34% of parents of 2068 chil-
dren ages 4 to 35 months did not be-
lieve their child's clinicians always took
time to understand their child's needs.
The Healthy Steps for Young Chil-
dren Program was designed to meet the
needs of families regarding their young
children's early development and be-
havior by enhancing relationships
between parents and their children, be-
tween families and the pediatric prac-
tice, and among practice members.11-13
Healthy Steps aims to enhance the ca-
pacity and effectiveness of pediatric pri-
mary care by incorporating develop-
mentalspecialistsintopediatricpractice.
The program was designed for all fami-
lies, not only those at risk for develop-
mental and behavioral problems, rec-
ognizing that all parents have concerns
and questions about their children's
health, development, and behavior.
This article presents results from the
national evaluation of Healthy Steps, the
first large clinical trial of an interven-
tion in pediatric practices to improve
delivery of developmental and behav-
ioral services. Initial findings, when the
children were ages 2 to 4 months, dem-
onstrated enhanced receipt of devel-
opmental services, increased satisfac-
tion with care, and enhanced parent
practices related to sleep position, feed-
ing, and infant development.14 In this
article, we report whether Healthy Steps
increased quality of care related to de-
velopmental and behavioral services
and affected parenting practices regard-
ing discipline, perceptions of their chil-
dren's behavior, and promotion of de-
velopment when children were ages 30
to 33 months.
METHODS
The Healthy Steps for Young Children
Program was a 3-year, prospective con-
trolled trial with 6 randomization and
9 quasi-experimental pediatric prac-
tice sites selected by program funders
and located in 14 states across the
United States (randomization sites: Al-
lentown, Pa; Amarillo, Tex; Florence,
SC; Iowa City, Iowa; Pittsburgh, Pa; and
San Diego, Calif. Quasi-experimental
sites: Boston, Mass; Chapel Hill, NC/
Birmingham, Ala; Chicago, Ill; De-
troit, Mich; Grand Junction, Colo/
Montrose, Colo; Kansas City, Kan;
Kansas City, Mo; New York, NY; and
Richmond, Tex/Houston, Tex).
Eligibility/Inclusion Criteria
Consecutive newborns up to 4 weeks
of age were enrolled at birth or their first
office visit and followed up to age 3
years. Newborns were excluded if they
were to be adopted or placed in foster
care, were too ill to make an office visit
by age 4 weeks, their mother did not
speak English or Spanish, or the fam-
ily intended to leave the practice within
6 months. Enrollment of families was
staggered beginning in September 1996
and ending in November 1998.
Within each randomization site, new-
borns were randomized to interven-
tion or control groups of approxi-
mately200newbornseach.Trainedstaff
carried out randomization in blocks of
4, using a computer-generated assign-
ment sequence concealed in sealed en-
velopes. Constraints on sample size (ie,
need to enroll 400 children total), space
limitations, scheduling logistics, and the
unwillingness of some practices to pro-
vide different services to families pre-
vented randomization at all sites. At
quasi-experimentalsites,upto200new-
borns were consecutively enrolled at the
intervention sites and at a comparison
site matched on organizational setting
(practice type and urban/rural loca-
tion) and demographic mix of pa-
tients.12
A simulation study was conducted to
evaluate the power of our design to de-
tect treatment effects for dichotomous
outcomes. Our simulation allowed for
clustering of outcomes within sites and
for a 33% missing outcome rate. For
randomization sites for a dichoto-
mous outcome and control-group
prevalences ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, we
found greater than 90% power to de-
tect a treatment effect odds ratio (OR)
of 1.5. For control group prevalences
of 0.1 and 0.9, the associated power was
roughly 70%. For the quasi-experimen-
tal design, the power was substan-
tially larger.
Intervention Protocol
Regardless of assignment, families re-
ceived all aspects of standard pediat-
ric care within the practice. Clinicians
at the randomization sites cared for both
intervention and control families. In-
tervention families also received the
Healthy Steps program components, in-
cluding contact with the Healthy Steps
Specialist. Each site had 2 Healthy Steps
Specialists with caseloads of approxi-
mately 100 families each. The Healthy
Steps Specialists were nurses, nurse
practitioners, early childhood educa-
tors, and social workers with training
and experience in child development.
The specialists' main focus was on de-
velopmental, behavioral, and psycho-
social aspects of care.
Healthy Steps provided 7 services to
intervention families: enhanced well-
child care (through visits with the phy-
sician and Healthy Steps Specialist); 6
home visits in the first 3 years; Healthy
Steps Specialist­staffed child develop-
mental telephone line to address par-
ents' developmental concerns; develop-
mental assessments; written materials
emphasizing prevention and health pro-
motion; parent groups offering support
and learning opportunities; and link-
ages to community resources through
targeted referrals. In enhanced well-
child visits, parents' questions and con-
cerns about child development and be-
havior were addressed, using "teachable
moments" and promotion of positive
parent-child interactions. These visits
alsoemphasizedthemother'shealthand
encouraged early learning through the
Reach Out and Read program.11,13,15

nual training sessions, stressing knowl-

edge in child development, parenting,
and practical clinical strategies; empha-
sizing the importance of relationships;
promotingmultidisciplinaryteambuild-
ing; and helping practices implement
Healthy Steps.16 Each site also received
program and training manuals and tech-
nical assistance through biweekly
teleconferences.Sitesalsoreceivedtrain-
ing in evaluation procedures. Imple-
mentation of written protocols was
monitored by the Healthy Steps na-
tional program office. Significant
changes were required in practice op-
erations related to space, appointment
scheduling (for joint Healthy Steps Spe-
cialist/physician visits), job responsi-
bilities, and team meetings. Some sites
experienced changes in practice own-
ership,administration,andstaffing,forc-
ing 1 site to close before completing the
study. Despite these challenges, all sites
made all components available from the
start of the program.
The study was approved by the hu-
man subjects committees at the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health and all participating institu-
tions. Families gave written informed
consent at the time of enrollment and
oral consent at each subsequent par-
ent interview.
Tracking
At 2 to 4 and at 30 to 33 months, fami-
lies provided data for the evaluation, re-
gardless of their continued use of care
at the original Healthy Steps practice.
Attempts to minimize study attrition in-
cluded mailing of annual birthday cards
marked "return service requested" to
inform evaluators of address changes,
annual queries of the National Change
of Address service to update contact in-
formation, and newsletters marked "re-
turn service requested."
Data Sources
Computer-assisted telephone inter-
views in English or Spanish were con-
ducted at 30 to 33 months by Battelle
Centers for Public Health Research and
Evaluation. The mother was the pri-
mary respondent (98.5%). If she was
not available, the child's guardian or pri-
mary caretaker was interviewed. Re-
spondents were asked about use of
health-related services, satisfaction with
care, perceptions of their children's be-
havior, parenting activities that pro-
mote development and safety, and the
mother's health status and problems
with depressive symptoms. Data on
demographic characteristics came from
enrollment forms and parent tele-
phone interviews at 2 to 4 months.
Data about well-child visits and vac-
cinationswereabstractedbytrainedstaff
from medical records when the child
reached age 32 months, including type
and date of visit and each vaccine re-
ceived. A random sample of 5% of re-
cords was reabstracted at each site. Per-
centage agreement was 87% or higher
forvisittype,96%orhigherforvisitdate,
99% or higher for vaccine type, and 98%
or higher for vaccine date.
Quality-of-Care Outcomes
Four domains of quality of care--
effectiveness, patient-centeredness,
timeliness, and efficiency--were op-
erationalized using the Institute of
Medicine framework (eBOX, available
online at: http://www.jama.com).17,18 Ef-
fectiveness included receipt of Healthy
Steps­related services, and patient-
centeredness described satisfaction and
experiences while seeking care. We cre-
ated subscales to measure parents' per-
ception of the care their family re-
ceived from their child's health care
providers. Internal consistency of the
scales, as assessed by Cronbach , ex-
ceeded .70 for all scales, the generally
accepted level for an internally consis-
tent scale.
Timeliness encompassed adherence to
the recommended schedule of well-
child care visits9 and vaccinations.19
Well-child visits and vaccinations that
occurred within the recommended pe-
riod were considered age-appropriate.
Children who received 4 doses of diph-
theria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, 3 doses
of polio vaccine, and 1 dose of measles-
mumps-rubella vaccine by age 2 years
were considered up-to-date. Doses re-
ceived before the minimum interval be-
tween doses were not counted.
Efficiency, ie, the avoidance of wasted
resources, included emergency depart-
ment (ED) use and hospitalizations be-
cause their costs per unit of service are
high and inappropriate use of re-
sources contributes to many of these
visits.20 Continued receipt of care at the
same practice after age 20 months also
was included since continuity of care
reduces the risk of hospitalizations and
ED use21 and increases consumer sat-
isfaction.22
Parenting Outcomes
Parenting outcomes included re-
sponses to child misbehavior, reports of
child behaviors, and selected age-
appropriateparentingpracticesthatpro-
mote child health and development
(eBox)."ParentalResponsetoChildMis-
behavior" assessed the frequency with
which parents used each of 12 re-
sponses to misbehavior in an average
week in the past month.23 The usual
7-point scale was condensed to 4 re-
sponse categories ranging from 0
("never") to 3 ("almost always") to fa-
cilitate telephone administration. Re-
sponses were dichotomized to indicate
whether individual approaches to disci-
pline were used "never" or "seldom" vs
"often" or "almost always." A con-
structed scale included more harsh re-
sponsestomisbehavior(eg,yellinginan-
ger, threatening, slapping the child's
hand, and spanking with a hand). The
respondent'stotalscorewassummedand
divided by the number of items and was
interpreted in relation to the response
categories for the item. One dichoto-
mous variable indicated "harsh disci-
pline"withameanscoreof1.5orhigher.
A second dichotomous variable indi-
catedwhethertheparenteverslappedthe
child in the face or spanked him or her
with an object. Two nonphysical strat-
egies (often or almost always negotiat-
ing and ignoring the misbehavior) were
assessed.
The Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL) for children aged 2 to 3 years
measured parents' perceptions of their
children's behavioral problems.24 Means
of 3 CBCL subscales (aggressive behav-
ior, anxious or depressed, sleep prob-

lems) were reported. Parents rated their
child for how true ("often," "some-
times," "never") each item was at the
time of the interview or within the pre-
vious 6 months.
Parenting practices included read-
ing to the child or showing the child
picture books, playing with the child,
and following daily routines at nap-
time, mealtime, and bedtime. We also
assessed parents' practices recom-
mended by the American Academy of
Pediatrics to promote child safety.8
A 14-item, abbreviated Center for
EpidemiologicStudies­Depressionscale
was used to assess mothers' depres-
sive symptoms.25 It included the same
response categories as the original 20-
item scale. Scores of 11 or greater in-
dicated the presence of maternal de-
pressive symptoms. The  coefficient
for the 14-item depression scale in the
Healthy Steps sample was .86, similar
to that for the total scale in general
population samples.25 Discussing sad-
ness with someone at the practice was
identified as a parenting practice that
promoted child development among
those respondents with depressive
symptoms at 30 to 33 months, those
who needed help with sadness since the
child was born, or those for whom ac-
tivities were restricted for 1 week or
longer in the previous 6 months be-
cause of feeling anxious or depressed.
Analysis
Families remained in their original
group assignment regardless of the site
of care or intensity of services re-
ceived. Randomization and quasi-
experimental sites were analyzed sepa-
rately and combined. In bivariate
analyses, we compared the distribu-
tion of quality-of-care outcomes and
parenting practices using 2 statistics
for categorical variables and t statis-
tics for continuous variables (eg, CBCL
scores).
Generalized regression models (lo-
gistic regression for dichotomous out-
comes, linear regression for continu-
ousoutcomes)wereusedtoestimatethe
overall adjusted effects of Healthy
Steps.26,27 These models included site
variables to account for the fact that
families within sites tend to respond
more similarly than those at different
sites. Marginal logistic regression mod-

variate data of more than 2%: unknown
ethnicity (5%), unknown source of in-
surance (6%), and unknown data for
other covariates (14%, including 3% fa-

sured by Medicaid (TABLE 1). These dif-
ferences were driven largely by differ-
ences observed at quasi-experimental
sites at baseline. There was no evidence
of selective attrition; at randomization
and at quasi-experimental sites, the per-
centages of nonresponders in the inter-
vention and control groups were simi-
lar for mothers younger than 20 years or
older than 30 years, with less than high
school education, and who were black,
Hispanic, or employed during the last
monthofpregnancy(dataavailableupon
request from authors).
Quality of Care Received
Overall, greater percentages of inter-
vention than control families reported
receiving effective, patient-centered,
timely, and efficient care (TABLE 2). At
randomization and at quasi-experimen-
tal sites, more than 75% of interven-
tion families received 4 or more Healthy
Steps­related services, had a home visit,
discussed more than 6 topics, had de-
velopmental assessments, and re-
ceived books; percentages for all 5 of
these categories were less than 45% at
control sites. Slightly less than 50% of
intervention families were informed
about community resources.
Amonginterventionandcontrolfami-
lies,satisfactionwithcarewashigh;more
than 95% of families agreed or strongly
agreed that the physicians or nurse prac-
titioners always had time to answer their
questions. Accordingly, we focused on
responses at the low end of the scale, ie,
thoseindicatingdissatisfactionwithcare.
A smaller percentage of intervention
families disagreed with statements in-
dicatingthattheclinician"providedsup-
port" and "listened" to them (Table 2).

The odds of receiving each compo-

was 4 to 20 times greater among inter-
ventionthancontrolfamilies(TABLE 3).
Families in the intervention group had
a greater odds of receiving 4 or more
Healthy Steps­related services (for ran-

respectively: OR, 16.90 [95% confi-
dence interval {CI}, 12.78 to 22.34] and
OR, 23.05 [95% CI, 17.38 to 30.58]), of

appropriate 1-month visit) (OR, 1.98
[95%CI,1.08to3.62]andOR,2.11[95%
CI, 1.16 to 3.85]). Intervention families
also reported increased odds of some-
one in the practice going out of the way
forthem(OR,2.06[95%CI,1.64to2.58]
andOR,2.11[95%CI,1.72to2.59])and

0.24 to 0.43]).
Intervention families had increased
odds of receiving timely preventive ser-
vices. Where age-appropriate well-
child and vaccination results were not
statistically significant at randomiza-
tion sites, the effect was in the same di-
rection as for quasi-experimental sites.
Children who received Healthy Steps
also had an increased odds of having a
visit after 20 months (OR, 2.02 [95%
CI, 1.61 to 2.55] and OR, 1.75 [95% CI,

consequences (94.1%) and showing
their child a more acceptable activity
(90.9%). Smaller percentages negoti-
ated with their child (57.1%), gave tim-
eouts (55.5%), withdrew privileges
(36.7%), or ignored their child's misbe-
havior (11.1%). Even smaller percent-
ages often or almost always yelled in an-
ger (11.8%), threatened their child
(19.4%), slapped their child's hand
(8.7%), or spanked with a hand (9.0%).
Regarding physical discipline, 6.9% ever
slappedtheirchildinthefaceorspanked
with an object, and 10.5% often or al-
most always yelled in anger, threat-
ened, slapped the child on the hand, or
spanked with a hand (TABLE 4).
Parents in the Healthy Steps group
had a reduced odds of slapping their
child in the face or spanking with an
object (for randomization and quasi-
experimental sites, respectively: OR,
0.82 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.26] and OR,
0.67 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.97]), while they
had an increased odds of negotiating
and ignoring, as observed in the total
sample. The magnitude and direction
of effect were similar although not al-
ways significant at randomization and
quasi-experimental sites (TABLE 5).
The mean scores for mothers' re-
sponses to the 3 CBCL subscales were
comparable to those for nonreferred
children reported by Achenbach,24 sug-
gesting that levels of behavioral prob-
lems for the Healthy Steps children were
similar to the levels for generally healthy
children. Mothers in the intervention
group had increased reporting of ag-
gressive behavior and problems sleep-
ing compared with control mothers,
and comparable perceptions of anx-
ious or depressed behaviors in their
children.
For mothers with depressive symp-
toms, those who needed help with sad-
ness, or those for whom activities were
restricted due to anxiety or depres-
sion, a larger percentage of interven-
tion than control mothers discussed
sadness with someone in the practice.
Across all families and at the quasi-
experimental sites, the odds of discuss-
ing sadness with someone in the prac-
tice was 2 times greater for intervention
mothers (OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.56 to
1.63] and OR, 2.82 [95% CI, 1.57 to
5.08]).
Mothers' use of safety practices was
high: 95.1% always or almost always
used a car seat, 90.2% used covers on
electrical outlets, 97.3% had working
smoke detectors in their homes, and
90.3% knew a number to call if their
child swallowed something harmful.
Families were less likely to use other
age-appropriate safety measures: 62.6%
used safety latches on cabinets and
31.7% placed stickers on bottles of poi-
sonous liquids. We found no signifi-
cant differences in safety practices be-
tween intervention and control families.
At 30 to 33 months, participation in
activities that promote development
also was high. There were no differ-
ences between groups in reading to or
playing with their children or in fol-
lowing routines.

COMMENT
This article documents findings from a
large-scaleinterventionimplementedin
responsetoconcernsaboutdevelopmen-
talneedsofyoungchildrenandtheabil-
ityofparentstomeettheseneeds.Healthy
Steps is unique among early child inter-
ventionsinthatitwasbasedinpediatric
practices,tooka"universal"approachto
addressing families' needs, and intro-
duced a new developmental specialist
into pediatric practices.
Participating pediatric practices
showed significant improvements in ef-
fectiveness, patient-centeredness, time-
liness, and efficiency of care. These im-
provements included marked parental
satisfaction with the program; more
timely preventive care, including on-
time immunizations; and the receipt of
more developmentally-oriented ser-
vices. We observed similar increases at
2 to 4 months.
At 30 to 33 months, intervention
families reported increased use of fa-
vorable discipline techniques. Al-
though the use of negative discipline
strategies was low, we believe that re-
ductions in yelling in anger, threaten-
ing, slapping in the face, and spanking
with an object are meaningful given the
associations of early discipline strate-
gies with later socioemotional devel-
opment, mental health, and parent-
child relationships.30 These treatment
effects were observed in families who
participated in a universal interven-
tion broadly focused on development
and behavior. Prior evaluations of early
childhood interventions with home
visits have focused on high-risk popu-
lations.
The program also appears to have af-
fected mothers' perceptions of their
children's behaviors. Intervention
mothers were more likely to report ag-
gressive behaviors and sleep prob-
lems. They also were more likely to talk
to someone at the practice about their
own depressive symptoms. We sus-
pect that participating mothers be-
came more sensitive in reading their
child's behavior and more comfort-
able discussing their child's behavior
and their own sadness with someone
at the practice. Full implementation of
Healthy Steps at each of the sites likely
contributed to the positive findings.31
Although Healthy Steps was not con-
ceived as a "quality improvement" in-
tervention, our findings indicate that
Healthy Steps made its impact through
improvements in quality of care and se-
lected effects on parenting practices.
Relative to other early childhood in-
terventions, however, the program was
modest in intensity. For example, Early
Head Start provides daily contact with
low-income families through center-
based programs or weekly contact
through home-based programs.32 The
Infant Health and Development Pro-
gram provided an average of 67 home
visits in children's first 3 years of life.33
In contrast, the average Healthy Steps
family made 11 well-child visits and re-
ceived less than 2 home visits within
their child's first 2.5 years. Correspond-
ing costs for the Healthy Steps pro-
gram ($402-$933 per year)15 were sub-
stantially less than those for Head Start
($4500 per year) or the Infant Health
andDevelopmentProgram($10000per
year).34
Contrary to expectations and de-
spite increased receipt of timely pre-
ventive services, Healthy Steps did not
influence hospitalizations or overall ED
use. Reducing receipt of these acute ser-
vices may require further systems and
practice-level changes (eg, making pri-
mary care available during weekends
and evenings). In addition, use of these

services is less discretionary in younger
children.
The design of the evaluation is
unique in that it drew upon the
strengths and weaknesses of both the
randomization and the quasi-
experimental designs. The randomiza-
tion design reduces bias in the selec-
tion of families in the program, but has
the weakness of possible spillover ef-
fects. The quasi-experimental design re-
duces spillover effects and makes it
easier to implement the program, but
does not eliminate the possibility of se-
lection bias.35,36 The use of prospec-
tively defined controls at quasi-
experimental sites likely contributed to
minimized discrepancies in outcomes
between randomization and quasi-
experimental groups.37 For several
parenting outcomes, such as disci-
pline practices, findings were of simi-
lar magnitude and direction at random-
ization and quasi-experimental sites,
but statistically significant at only quasi-
experimental sites, where the sample
size was larger; they were significant in
the pooled sample, as well.
A number of limitations should be
noted. The site selection process meant
that Healthy Steps was evaluated against
a high standard of performance among
practices already oriented toward pro-
viding developmental and behavioral
services. Many evaluation sites al-
ready provided one or more program
components. During the evaluation,
some comparison practices adopted na-
tional programs, such as Reach Out and
Read,38 that were components of
Healthy Steps from its inception.
Overall high levels among interven-
tion and comparison families of base-
line practices to promote toddler de-
velopment and safety likely contributed
to lack of treatment effects in relation
to injury prevention and parents' prac-
tices to promote development. Par-
ents' engagement in these activities was
higher than that reported in the Na-
tional Survey of Early Childhood Health
(NSECH)6 and the Commonwealth
Fund Survey of Parents with Young
Children (CWF).4 For example, more
Healthy Steps parents read to their chil-
dren daily or showed their children pic-
ture books (Healthy Steps, 68%;
NSECH, 52%; CWF, 48%) and had the
same bedtime (Healthy Steps, 77%;
NSECH, 68%). Similar percentages of
parents played with their child daily
(Healthy Steps, 87%; CWF, 84%) and
covered electrical outlets (Healthy
Steps, 90%; NSECH, 94%). Our find-
ings at 30 to 33 months contrast with
our findings at 2 to 4 months showing
enhanced feeding practices, decreases
in use of the prone sleep position, in-
creased daily use of picture books, and
increased daily playing.14,15 At 2 to 4
months, however, we similarly ob-
served no treatment effect with regard
to infant routines.
Parents who completed the inter-
view at 30 to 33 months were more so-
cially advantaged than the total en-
rolled population. Medical records data
for nearly all enrolled children (5351
of 5565 [96%]) showed that non-
sampled children had fewer age-
appropriate well-child visits and vac-
cinations (data available from authors
upon request). Comparable treatment
effects, however, were observed when
analyses were conducted on the full
sample with medical records (n=5351).
Nevertheless, for some parenting prac-
tices, our findings may be overesti-
mates if families lost to follow-up would
have required more intensive interven-
tions to change behavior. Findings also
may be underestimates because re-
sponding families may have reported in-
creased use of favorable parenting be-
haviors at baseline. Finally, baseline
differences between quasi-experimen-
tal intervention and control families are
a limitation to the extent that covari-
ates did not account for these differ-
ences. We nonetheless believe that we
adequately captured baseline differ-
ences. Moreover, the consistent find-
ings for randomization and quasi-
experimental sites appear to support
this conclusion.
Given nonresponse, generalizabil-
ity of our findings to the original co-
hort is possible to the extent that (1)
within levels of baseline covariates,
treatment assignment is independent of
the outcome; (2) within levels of base-
line covariates, missingness of an out-
come is independent of the outcome;
and (3) our regression models are cor-
rectly specified.39 While the first and
second assumptions cannot be empiri-
cally validated, we did not have differ-
ential attrition of families, and we be-
lieve that we have included a set of
covariates to increase the plausibility of
these assumptions.
Pediatricpracticesprovideuniqueop-
portunities to favorably influence health
care for young children, increase par-
ents' satisfaction, and influence paren-
tal practices to improve child develop-
ment and behavior. This evaluation of
Healthy Steps demonstrates that im-
provement is possible and that all fami-
lies benefit, not only those at high risk.
Eleven of the 15 participating practices
continued to provide all or some of the
program components 18 months after
demonstration funding ended. In addi-
tion, variants of the Healthy Steps model
have been or are being implemented in
additional sites across the country.15 Fi-
nally, the evaluation is ongoing as we as-
sess whether there are sustained and
emerging effects on parenting as chil-
dren reach 5.5 years of age.
