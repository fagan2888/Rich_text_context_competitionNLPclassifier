Introduction: Game Theory and the
Strategy of Conflict
Thomas Schelling's The Strategy of Conflict (hereafter SoC)
remains one of the most successful applications of game the-
ory. Over half a century after its first publication in 1960,
SoC's insights into the logic of disarmament and deterrence
stand out as an early and brilliant example of the important--
sometimes vital--benefits that can be gained by analyzing
strategy as a rational form of behavior. Highlighting the scope
of his contribution, Schelling's work has been duly heralded
for its practical influence on U.S. national security doctrine
and foreign policy in the nuclear age (Ayson, 2004; Freedman,
1989; Trachtenberg, 1989), as well as for the pioneering role
it has played in the development of game theory (Crawford,
1991; Dixit, 2006; Myerson, 1999, 2009; Zeckhauser, 1989).
However, SoC also raises significant theoretical questions
that have yet to be fully addressed. At a more immediate
level, it seeks to determine the kind of rationality involved in
strategic interaction. At a more fundamental level, it asks
whether game theory can provide an appropriate framework
for dealing with problems of interdependent decision in
domains as applied and diverse as economics, politics, and
military warfare. Many economic readers of SoC assume
that these questions have been successfully answered and
that game theory, by formalizing many of Schelling's ideas,
has realized his vision for the discipline. In doing so, they
tend to underestimate the originality of Schelling's project
and overlook its relevance to current research. As such, the
lessons SoC holds for game theory and for the study of stra-
tegic decision-making deserve to be revisited.
Two points must be kept in mind when assessing SoC's
contribution. First of all, Schelling's study of strategy has a
strong behavioral aspect. One of its main goals is to identify
the actual processes that constitute strategic reasoning.
Indeed, many of the moves and tactics typically encountered
in the context of bargaining and conflict are difficult to
square with standard assumptions about rational play and
cannot be properly understood without a deeper investiga-
tion. Examples include commitments, threats and promises;
brinkmanship; and various instances of the "hands-tied"
paradox which consists in influencing outcomes by weaken-
ing one's position (reducing one's options, relinquishing ini-
tiative, and so on). These processes also play a central role in
Schelling's analysis of another important phenomenon:

Strategy as Mutually Contingent Choice:
New Behavioral Lessons from Thomas
Schelling's The Strategy of Conflict
Neil Martin1
Abstract
Thomas Schelling's The Strategy of Conflict carries significant behavioral implications which have been overlooked by economic
readers. I argue that these implications are central to Schelling's vision of game theory, that they fit well with recent advances
in experimental psychology and behavioral economics, and provide a comprehensive framework that can inform research
on strategy. In my view, Schelling develops a non-mathematical approach to strategy which anticipates on Gigerenzer and
Selten's "ecological rationality" program. This approach maps the processes involved in strategic reasoning and highlights
their reliance on the particular information structure of interactive social environments. Building on this approach, I model
strategy as a heuristic form of reasoning that governs the way in which individuals search for and provide cues in situations
of mutually contingent choice. I conclude by examining how the reference to ecological rationality can help clarify Schelling's
contribution to game theory and outline potential avenues of research into strategic reasoning and interaction.

players' ability to coordinate decisions in a wide range of
settings.1
Second, Schelling's study of strategy has a broader theo-
retical ambition. By integrating strategic processes and con-
tent into game theory, Schelling hopes not only to improve
the discipline's practical applicability but to establish it as a
theory of interdependent decision that can help make sense
of complex interactions in a wide range of domains. In this
respect, SoC is as much about the implications of strategy for
game theory as it is about the application of game theory to
strategy.
To provide a clearer assessment of SoC and of its complex
legacy, I address three questions successively in this article.
What does Schelling's theory of interdependent decision con-
sist in? What research program does it belong to? And what
does it contribute to game theory? In the section "Schelling's
Project: Bringing Strategy Into Game Theory," I present
Schelling's project as developed in SoC. In my view,
Schelling's theory of interdependent decision does not simply
restate game theory in slightly less abstract terms, but pro-
poses to reconstruct it in line with a more realistic understand-
ing of strategy. In "Schelling's Research Program: An
Ecologically Rational Perspective on Strategy" section, I show
that while Schelling's theory of interdependent decision draws
on psychological and contextual elements, it still refers to a
meaningful conception of rationality. In this respect, it can be
related to Gigerenzer and Selten's "ecological rationality" pro-
gram. In the section "Schelling's Contribution: A Behavioral
Model of Strategic Reasoning," I argue that SoC delivers
results under the form of a heuristic model of strategic reason-
ing. The final section "Conclusion: Drawing Lessons From
SoC" concludes by reassessing SoC's legacy on three points:
its relation to game theory, how Schelling's model of strategic
reasoning compares to competing economic models, and the
possibility of extending this model.
Schelling's Project: Bringing Strategy
Into Game Theory
Strategy as a Starting Point for Game Theory
Schelling's conception of strategy is highly original. He does
not think of the notion in usual game-theoretic fashion as a
plan or rule of action that can be directly derived from the
player's available information and set of feasible choices--
given individual preferences and prior assumptions about
rationality. Instead, he considers it as a mode of decision-
making that relates to interactive contexts. Strategy, for
Schelling, is not ordinary instrumental rationality as it applies
to the pursuit of long-term goals or to competitive activities in
the field of battle or play. It is what becomes of rationality
"[when a player's best course of action] depends on the choices
that others will make or are making" (Schelling, 2006, p. 3), an
idea first formulated in Schelling (1960, pp. 9-10). As such,
the analysis of strategy constitutes a necessary first step toward
understanding how rational individuals take decisions in "an
environment that consists of other people responding to their
environment, which consists of people responding to an envi-
ronment of people's responses" (Schelling, 2006, p. 14).
Schelling's intuition is that the processes through which
rational individuals take decisions in interactive contexts are
specific and need to be identified as part of the analysis. This
intuition is supported by a number of different observations:
·
· Interactive contexts confront players with a well-
defined task. When players are interdependent, taking
decisions becomes less a question of determining
which course of action is best for oneself and more a
matter of predicting what others will do. In this
respect, strategy draws attention to the way in which
players form expectations in social settings.
·
· Players adopt particular forms of reasoning in these
contexts. These forms of reasoning are distinctly stra-
tegic. The most notable example studied in SoC is that
of "focusing," which involves predicting the behavior
of others we are interacting with by anticipating the
expectations they may have of us. These forms of rea-
soning are also problematic from the point of view of
game theory, as they often rely on contextual variables
(labels, background elements, and so on) that are not
captured by the game's formal description and payoff
structure.
·
· Strategic reasoning of this kind can contribute to the
emergence of social order. SoC establishes a link
between significant macro-phenomena, such as the
informal regulation of conflict (including nuclear
deterrence) or the robustness of large-scale schemes
of voluntary cooperation, and players' ability to
jointly negotiate mutual expectations--through tacit
as well as explicit means--and single out particular
outcomes as a solution to common coordination
problems.
This conception of strategy provides the cornerstone for
Schelling's project of establishing game theory as a theory of
interdependent decision. It unites SoC's two main parts: (a)
its criticism of game theory and (b) its proposed reorientation
of the discipline.
Schelling's Criticism of Game Theory
Schelling criticizes different aspects of game theory in
SoC: the discipline's focus on zero-sum games; its lack of
practical applicability in non-zero-sum contexts; and the
limits of its mathematical approach to strategic behavior.
These critical themes, some of which have been addressed
by modern game theory, reflect a common underlying argu-
ment that remains potent, namely that game theory's tradi-
tional methodology is ill-adapted to the interactive
dimension of strategy.
Martin 3
The crux of Schelling's argument lies in the distinction he
makes between zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. In
Schelling's view, zero-sum games constitute a special case
and cannot be used as a starting-point for understanding stra-
tegic behavior because of the role played by the minimax
theorem in these contexts. The minimax theorem provides
players with a rule of action for zero-sum games (minimize
your potential losses) that is both optimal in terms of
expected utility and, more importantly, independent of what
others do. In this respect, what makes zero-sum games more
tractable for game theory also limits their practical value by
taking the interactive element and much of the uncertainty
out of the game.
Rational players engaged in a zero-sum game do not need
to consider their opponents' expectations and actual choices.
Indeed, they can factor them out of their decision-making:
All that really matters to them is the other's payoff function
and the particular way in which it relates to their own.
Moreover, players have no incentive to coordinate decisions
and no reason to communicate. Consequently, the equilib-
rium solution defined for zero-sum games by the minimax
theorem is not only unique and rational, it is one that cannot
be improved on by joint action. In other words, the strategy
of zero-sum games is self-centered and interdependence has
no influence on decision-making, at least in any positive
sense.
The same conclusions no longer hold in non-zero-sum
games. Here, decision-making is more complex: It covers
situations where the best course of action can be inseparably
linked to what another does, where mutual expectations are
key to coordinating on an efficient outcome and players have
an interest in communicating.2 By failing to sufficiently
adjust its methodology to reflect this greater complexity,
early forms of game theory have bypassed the interactive
dimension of strategy rather than addressing it.
The methodological differences between Schelling's
approach and that of traditional game theory are further
underlined by his focal-point explanation of bargaining.
Traditional theories of bargaining start by identifying either
the formal characteristics of a general solution for non-zero-
sum games or a rational rule of action that applies to these
contexts. It is then assumed that rational players can recon-
struct the solution based on these characteristics or select the
appropriate rule of action and, in doing so, align their expec-
tations of each other so that they achieve the equilibrium pre-
dicted by the theory. Schelling argues instead that solutions
to actual bargaining problems do not seem to share any par-
ticular characteristics other than being recognized as such by
the players. In this view, what makes a given solution ratio-
nal to a set of players is something simpler and more funda-
mental: the fact that it is "salient" or "uniquely prominent"
for them in some commonly understood way which leads
them to form concordant mutual expectations of each other.
Salience, however, is a deeply problematic property. It
cannot easily be formalized, nor can it be attributed ex ante
to an outcome with any certainty. Indeed, although salience
is often attached to a discernible variable in the game's envi-
ronment, formulation, or contextual background, it does not
overlap with any objective quality in particular. It cannot be
assimilated to a subjective trait of the players either, though
it can be influenced by who they are and what they know
about each other. Instead, the type of salience involved in
focal-point coordination is constructed "on the spot" by the
strategic reasoning of players as part of a common exercise
in coordinated problem-solving.3
The implications of Schelling's criticism of game theory
are most evident here. To properly understand how rational
individuals make choices in non-zero-sum contexts, game
theory must be able to analyze what their strategic reasoning
consists in. For Schelling, this cannot be done by purely
mathematical means. When game theory seeks to formalize
strategic reasoning in mathematical terms, it sets itself at a
level of abstraction that misses the "essentials of the situation
and of the behaviour in question" (Schelling, 1960, p. 13). By
doing so, it leaves itself unable to properly grasp the nature of
the processes involved in interactive decision-making or the
contextual variables that are relevant to its outcome. What
Schelling proposes is another option, which aims to model
strategic reasoning at a level of lesser abstraction. To achieve
this aim, he adopts a richer non-mathematical approach that
takes account of the environmental and behavioral aspects of
strategy.
Schelling's Proposed Reorientation of Game
Theory
What shape this alternative approach might take is outlined
in the second part of SoC (chaps. 4-6), devoted to a reorien-
tation of game theory. It includes an attempt to reclassify
games and a proposal to enrich game theory along at least
two axes.
Schelling's reclassification of games builds on his distinc-
tion between zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. It highlights
a key aspect of strategic behavior, namely that it is sensitive
to the degree of conflict and collaboration inherent to a game,
as measured by the commonality and divergence of interest
between players.4 Commonality and divergence of interest
are understood here as broad features of the game which
influence the behavior of players at a deeper level than simple
individual payoffs. Most significantly, they affect the nature
of communication between players. In this respect, what con-
stitutes rational play varies depending on whether the essence
of the game consists in revealing one's intentions to a partner
(pure collaboration), concealing one's intentions from a rival
(pure conflict), or selectively communicating them to some-
one who is both a partner and a rival (mixed motives).
This reclassification clarifies the sense in which non-
zero-sum games are more complex than zero-sum ones.
Communication and enforcement play a crucial role in
interactive contexts that they do not have otherwise. In
4 SAGE Open
bargaining games, communication has a tactical as well as
an informational significance. Players not only need to
find ways to communicate with others, they must also
ensure that their communication is credible. Pure collabo-
ration presents an analytically useful limiting case for non-
zero-sum play where the bargaining element is absent. In
this simplified case, the players still need to coordinate
decisions around a common interest and the only feature of
relevance to them in the game's structure is the communi-
cation system. In the zero-sum game by contrast, there is
no scope for communication between rational players and
no need for enforcement. In theory therefore, communica-
tion and enforcement systems are not part of the structure
of zero-sum games and can be abstracted away from their
analysis without loss.
Schelling's proposals for enriching game theory introduce
two additional components designed to help it match the
complexity of strategic behavior in non-zero-sum games. A
theory of interdependent decision must thus include, first of
all, a perceptual axis which addresses the way in which play-
ers identify each other's intentions, what resources they rely
on to do so, and what expectations they can form on this
basis. A theory of interdependent decision must also include
a communicational axis, whose object is to specify the means
of communication and enforcement that are available to
players, as well as the opportunities these moves create for
influencing the expectations and actions of others. This
implies looking beyond the easily separable "institutional"
channels provided for by the rules of the game or the design
of the experiment. Indeed, one of SoC's main conclusions
consists in showing that, far from constituting "cheap talk,"
tacit and informal modes of communication not only influ-
ence behavior but often underpin more overt and enforceable
forms of communication.
Schelling's Research Program: An
Ecologically Rational Perspective on
Strategy
Strategic Environments and Reasoning in SoC
Schelling's quest for greater realism sees him introduce psy-
chological elements and contextual variables into the frame-
work of game theory without renouncing the latter's reference
to individual rationality. His theory of interdependent deci-
sion is meant to be a theory of rational choice in contexts of
interdependent decision. However, it draws significant con-
clusions about the nature of rational choice in contexts of
interdependent decision from the empirical study of strategy.
These conclusions shed light on the type of rationality
Schelling is referring to and on the research program his
project belongs to.5
Most importantly, Schelling takes the cognitive limitations
of players as an integral part of the analysis of strategy. The
coordination problems players encounter in contexts of
interdependent decision place heavy demands on them as
strategic choices often have to be made in real-time, with lim-
ited information and scope for learning. Yet, the experimental
evidence also confirms that players routinely overcome coor-
dination problems of this kind in a wide range of settings, and
that the outcomes they achieve can be surprisingly efficient
and robust. The challenge for Schelling consists in explaining
how players whose cognitive abilities are finite manage to
solve such problems without the help of complex calcula-
tions, high levels of foresight, and exacting standards of
mutual knowledge. In other words, how players coordinate
decisions using processes that are psychologically realistic,
computationally fast, and informationally frugal.
Schelling's non-mathematical approach to strategy is suf-
ficiently flexible to address this challenge. It does so by com-
bining two lines of inquiry: (a) into the actual abilities of
players and (b) into the nature of strategic environments. The
result is an ecologically rational perspective on strategy.6
Ecologically rational models explain behavior based on two
sets of factors: "[the heuristic processes through which] a
judgment or decision is reached [and] the class of environ-
ments in which these heuristics will succeed or fail"
(Gigerenzer & Selten, 2001, p. 4). What sets ecological ratio-
nality apart from other versions of bounded rationality is its
evolutionary perspective and strong emphasis on the adap-
tive aspects of human behavior. Ecological rationality bets
on the capacity of rational individuals to simplify their deci-
sion-making process by using contextual resources when
faced with complex tasks, rather than counting on pure cog-
nitive ability and sophisticated reasoning. The effectiveness
of these ecologically rational modes of behavior derives
from a match between the structure of the heuristics indi-
viduals apply to a given task and the structure of the environ-
ments in which they have to perform this task.
Schelling draws on both sets of factors in SoC. First of all,
he redefines strategic reasoning on more detailed procedural
grounds. His analysis of strategy brings two basic mental
faculties into the picture: mutual perception and pattern rec-
ognition. Pattern recognition is a simple and well-established
phenomenon which reflects the ability to discover and infer
predictable regularities in one's environment and in the
behavior of others. It falls under the perceptual component of
Schelling's theory of interdependent decision and is not
problematic. SoC provides further evidence of players' pro-
pensity to use pattern recognition as a basis for reasoning in
strategic settings.7
Mutual perception plays an even more important role in
Schelling's understanding of strategic reasoning. It consists
in a type of joint awareness through which players are able to
recognize the relevance of particular variables to a common
coordination problem, attribute the same recognition to oth-
ers, and adjust their sense of what is relevant in light of the
inferences they can make about these others. This "joint
awareness" underpins the construction of salience and the
profoundly interactive modes of reasoning that constitute
Martin 5
strategic behavior in non-zero-sum games. When successful,
it allows players to form mutually consistent expectations of
each other and take decisions as if they were acting accord-
ing to a concerted plan.8
Mutual perception is more difficult to analyze than pat-
tern recognition and its implications for game theory are less
straightforward. Schelling views it as an intuitive faculty that
is undemanding in informational and cognitive terms, and
whose reliability can be demonstrated under experimental
conditions. In this respect, he considers that rational players
have, within their perceptual apparatus, a mind-reading abil-
ity which endows them with the "capacity to determine intro-
spectively the choices that a partner would make."9
Consequently, SoC's account of strategic reasoning intro-
duces into game theory something like a theory of mind
mechanism to explain how players predict the behavior of
others and form mutual expectations.10
Second, Schelling pays greater attention to the nature of
the contexts within which strategic reasoning takes place.
Game theory usually defines a strategic environment as "any
situation in which individuals are affected by each other's
decisions" (Crawford, 1991, p. 267). Schelling introduces a
further distinction between two senses in which decisions
can be interdependent. The first "strict" sense of interdepen-
dence requires that players be bound by a relation of mutual
contingency--in which case they need to know what choices
others are making to take their own decisions. The second
"wide" sense implies only that individual decisions involve
externalities--meaning that players simply care about the
choices others make without these choices being essential to
their course of action.
This distinction becomes explicit in Schelling (2006, pp.
28, 213-216), but it is already present in SoC. Its importance
is often overlooked, yet I would argue that it is fundamental
to Schelling's theory of interdependent decision since SoC
builds on the assumption that strategic behavior can be
related to contexts of strict interdependence. Indeed, mutual
contingency features as a condition for effective coordina-
tion.11 It also enters into the definition of key concepts such
as "games of strategy," "theory of strategy," strategic behav-
ior and moves, and is what gives the notion of deterrence and
the game of pure collaboration their strategic dimension
(Schelling, 1960, pp. 3 fn1, 13, 15-16, 46, 86). From there, it
can be concluded that Schelling identifies strategic environ-
ments with a special class of games. These games are referred
to simply as "games of strategy," but they can more appropri-
ately be described as "games of mutual contingency."
Games of Mutual Contingency and Their
Characteristics
Games of mutual contingency provide an abstract represen-
tation of the complex social environments which give rise to
interactive decision-making. As such, they allow us to char-
acterize strategic environments in terms that are tractable for
game theory. These games do not capture the material con-
tent and contextual resources that are essential to rational
play in real strategic environments, but valuable lessons
about the logic of strategic reasoning can be drawn from the
study of their general structure.
Games of mutual contingency form a broad class which
cuts across coordination, bargaining, and conflict. What
these games have in common is the fact that the "need to
know" condition is written into their payoff structure. A
game of mutual contingency is a game in which payoffs are
configured in such a way that they exclude dominant indi-
vidual strategies. Schelling studies a number of these games
in SoC, including such typical cases as the Rendez-Vous
game, the Assurance game, the game of Chicken, and the
Matching Pennies game.12
The lack of individually dominant strategies presents
players with a problem, as can easily be verified from
Figure 1. The game either lacks an equilibrium in pure
strategies--in which case players cannot solve it without
using more sophisticated mixed strategies,13 or it has mul-
tiple equilibria, in which case players must find a way to
correlate their choices. This immediate problem (defining
or selecting an equilibrium without dominant strategies) is
further compounded by the fact that players are interdepen-
dent not only in terms of the decisions they take (the best
course of action for each player depends on the choice she
expects another to make), but also in terms of the expecta-
tions they can form about each other (what choice a player
can expect another to make depends on what that other
expects the player's course of action to be, knowing that the
player is in a similar situation to start with). In this respect,
interdependence of expectations represents the main and
irreducible feature of mutually contingent choice. Game
theory has found it particularly difficult to define rational
behavior under these conditions, because it cannot explain
how players form mutual expectations and reach a determi-
nate outcome without specifying a common principle of
choice for them--through rational deduction or by social
convention.14
Games of mutual contingency are highly indeterminate
from a formal point of view. At a more practical level, how-
ever, they have other characteristics that can be more readily
exploited by players. Most importantly, they are situations in
which players find themselves unable to compare alternative
courses of action because interdependence of expectations
prevents them from mapping their choices to outcomes with
any degree of certainty. Out of the numerous options avail-
able, what action to play is not a question of frequency or
probability, but of what the other will do and what that other
will expect us to do. In this respect, games of mutual contin-
gency are situations in which predictors for the behavior of
others constitute the main--in some cases sole--reasons to
act and players need to identify cues to take decisions. As a
result, the nature of the decision-process itself changes in
situations of mutually contingent choice.
6 SAGE Open
Equally significant, non-zero-sum games of mutual con-
tingency are situations in which players can benefit from
making their intentions or expectations known to those they
are interacting with. These are "desperately cooperative

situations," to borrow Schelling's expression, in which action
is de facto endowed with a signaling value. Individual action
of any sort, insofar as it provides information about a play-
er's intentions or expectations, also provides other players
with a reason to act. The rationale for strategic moves can be
found here: They are cues for the action of others and means
of leading them to make particular choices by playing on the
expectations they have of us.
Schelling's Contribution: A Behavioral
Model of Strategic Reasoning
The Foundations of Schelling's Model
Schelling's core aim throughout SoC is to model strategic rea-
soning as part of a wider effort to make sense of interactive
behavior. By adopting an ecologically rational perspective, he is
able to establish the psychological and environmental founda-
tions on which such a model can be built. This model allows us
to reconstruct strategic reasoning as a simple heuristic process
which governs the way in which players search for information
and take decisions in contexts of mutually contingent choice. It
posits that players are capable of mutual perception--implying
the existence of a theory of mind mechanism--and that they are
rational in the limited sense that they exploit the underlying
characteristics of their environment to achieve their goals. In
this respect, SoC successfully accomplishes Schelling's project
and uses the analysis of strategy as a basis for developing a more
realistic behavioral form of game theory.
The first element in this model derives from the fact that
the structure of information is specific in contexts of mutually
contingent choice. Indeed, mutual contingency defines the
type of information that players can search for. In strategic
environments, search concerns cues rather than alternatives.
Players cannot simply compare payoffs when deciding
between given courses of action; they must also determine
adequate reasons for their choices. Their main task does not
consist in exploring or expanding their opportunity set in
search of an optimal outcome for themselves, but in finding a
set of predictors associated with the different courses of
action available to them and to those they are interacting with.
To do so, players must either
·
· obtain cues from their environment that will enable
them to form expectations about the choices others are
making or will make.15
·
· or, provide cues that will enable others to predict the
choices that the player is making or will make, through
the use of strategic moves.
The search for cues does not take place at random, as
mutual contingency also helps define what constitutes a
"valid" cue. For players who need to coordinate their choices
to reach a particular outcome, a valid cue is one that gives at
least one of them a reason to act and can be recognized as
such by both, allowing them to form concordant expectations
of each other. In other words, it must be a common signal
that both players can perceive as relevant to the coordination
problem they face. Environmental cues can therefore be
measured along a single dimension, that of salience. Players
who are capable of mutual perception can identify this
dimension and use it to guide their search for cues.16
Similarly, to constitute a valid cue, a strategic move must
act as a credible signal. That is, it must convey the player's
intentions or expectations in a way that can be recognized by
the other and affect his expectations of the player's own
behavior--either by fostering an expectation or by dislodg-
ing an existing one. It should be noted that mutual contin-
gency only defines the form of cues (commonality and
salience for environmental cues; credibility for strategic
moves), not their content. What is salient and what is credi-
ble depends on the players as well as on the situation and can
vary from case to case. Whether the players succeed in coor-
dinating on a common cue or not, and what that cue consists
in, remain inherently empirical questions for Schelling.
In a second crucial foundation for this model, SoC offers
psychologically plausible bases for understanding how
boundedly rational players can limit their search, select cues,
and take decisions. Mutual perception also plays an impor-
tant role here. The ability to attribute perceptions of salience
to others, to form beliefs about the way in which their expec-
tations are influenced by the common environment and
updated in the course of interaction, provides players with a
simple and natural stopping rule that limits the search pro-
cess. In contexts of mutually contingent choice, this search
process is conducted by both players and ends as soon as
they perceive themselves to be acting on the same cue--that
is, as soon as they identify a cue salient enough to focus the
mutual expectations they have of each other.
The existence of cues also dispenses with the need for
complex decision rules. By allowing players to form
defined expectations of each other's behavior, environmen-
tal cues, coordinated problem-solving, and strategic moves
reduce the indeterminacy of games of mutual contingency
and make "solutions" more easily identifiable. In bargain-
ing for instance, strategic moves can narrow the choice
between a potentially unlimited set of options down to a
single binary decision: take it or leave it. Two cases apply
here. Players must either solve the simple maximization
problem that others have posed them or that they have con-
structed together. Or else, if possible, they can engage in
further strategic maneuvering to change the outcome to
their potential benefit. This can be done by providing
another cue to those they are interacting with or by neutral-
izing an existing cue.
Strategy as Heuristics of Mutually Contingent
Choice
Taking the above into account, I argue that strategic reason-
ing, as presented in SoC, can be modeled in the following
way:
8 SAGE Open
In the model presented in Figure 2, strategic reasoning
combines three types of rules to produce applied heuristics
for mutually contingent choice17:
1. A simple search rule that is adapted to the specific
structure of strategic environments.
2. A simple stopping rule that can be referred to as take
the most salient. In contexts of mutually contingent
choice, the object is not to determine which cue is
most salient from the player's own point of view, but
which one is most likely to be jointly recognized as
such. Mutual perception allows players to adjust their
sense of what is salient, by placing themselves in the
other's position. The take the most salient rule is per-
fectly tailored to the type of fast and frugal decision-
making that is often required in strategic interaction.
It is sensitive to the constraints under which a player
operates (in terms of time, energy, and material
resources) when stopping the search for information.
In this respect, salience can function as an "aspiration
level" for partial or interrupted search (stop search as
soon as a suitably striking cue is found) or as a crite-
rion for assessment in a full search (assess all avail-
able cues and select the most salient).
3. Simple decision rules which imply only that players
act on the strongest cue and choose their preferred
outcome given the other's predicted behavior. No
more than they need complete information to take a
decision, players do not make complex calculations of
utility or probability in this model. The model simply
requires that they be able to compare outcomes in a
way that allows them to solve reduced maximization
problems (what course of action is better if the others
act in a given way?). Furthermore, where moves are
costly as is generally the case in bargaining, players
must be able to compare costs in such a way that they
can make broad estimates about the efficiency of a
strategic move (How likely is a threat or promise to be
believed? Is the move worth making to obtain a par-
ticular outcome?).
Schelling's theory implies that the status of cues will likely
be influenced by the nature of interaction and that the expec-
tations players form about each other's reactions and modes
of thinking will vary between contexts of Collaboration,
Bargaining, and Conflict. Similarly, the availability, cost,
and effectiveness of moves will depend on the particular
characteristics of the communication and enforcement sys-
tems. The theory leads to one general conclusion however,
which the present model seeks to highlight, namely that stra-
tegic reasoning has a common basic structure which reflects
a logic of mutually contingent choice.
Conclusion: Drawing Lessons From
SoC
Schelling's attempt to engage strategic behavior more directly
in SoC has presented game theory with something of a
dilemma. On one hand, the depth and influence of Schelling's
analysis have helped establish the practical value of game
theory and open up a wide range of real-world applications.
On the other, much of the theoretical underpinning for this
analysis, including Schelling's investigation of the actual pro-
cesses involved in strategic reasoning, is still considered

problematic and remains at the margins of the discipline.
Conflicting interpretations of SoC in the literature, between
those who claim Schelling as a user and inspiration for game
theory and those who view him instead as a critic or as a pro-
ducer of game theory, illustrate this continued ambivalence.
The present article revisits this debate by paying closer atten-
tion to Schelling's theory of interdependent decision. It argues
that SoC develops a coherent and innovative behavioral basis
for analyzing strategy, which is more properly understood in
connection with the bounded rationality program as put for-
ward by Gigerenzer and Selten (2001). Read in this light, SoC
can be shown to anticipate on notions such as ecological
rationality, fast-and-frugal heuristics, and theory of mind by
several decades.
This connection is important to make for several reasons.
Historical first of all, as it allows us to situate Schelling's
contribution in response to the debate mentioned above. In
this perspective, Schelling should be seen neither simply as
an applied user nor as an outside critic, but truly as a pro-
ducer of game theory--albeit one who belongs to a branch of
the discipline that is experimental in method and behavioral
in outlook.18 Conceptual also, as the reference to ecological
rationality and fast-and-frugal heuristics allows us to clarify
some of the key aspects of Schelling's theory. The former
notably underlines the essential link which Schelling makes
in SoC between the process of strategic reasoning and the
particular information structure of interactive social environ-
ments. While the latter can help us organize the various non-
standard elements (salience, focusing, mutual perception)
introduced by Schelling's analysis into a defined and realis-
tic model of strategic reasoning.
Interesting as these considerations may be in terms of
how we read Schelling and assess his contribution, the most
important lessons to be drawn from SoC concern its implica-
tions for experimental research. Schelling's theory of inter-
dependent decision, as modeled here, makes a number of
predictions regarding strategic behavior and interaction
which can be used to highlight avenues for research and out-
line areas in which Schelling's project could be taken up by
the ecological rationality program.
1. Schelling's theory of interdependent decision is built
around the assumption that strategic reasoning can be
modeled by heuristics that reflect a logic of mutually
contingent choice.
The heuristic nature of strategic reasoning is well estab-
lished experimentally. Evidence of players' ability to solve
complex coordination problems with limited information
and time can be found going back to SoC and has been con-
firmed by subsequent studies, including Mehta, Starmer, and
Sugden (1994). SoC adds to our understanding of strategic
reasoning by connecting it to the information structure of
interactive environments and by defining mutual contin-
gency as its basic logic. Both of these dimensions offer
opportunities for research, regarding the way in which play-
ers treat information and cues in different contexts or the way
in which changes in conditions relating to mutual contin-
gency affect strategic reasoning.19
Furthermore, Schelling's model maps the decision-mak-
ing process for a wide class of games that cover several reg-
isters of interaction (coordination, bargaining, conflict) and
translate into different modes of strategic behavior. In this
respect, it does not necessarily compete with other existing
models which operate within more restricted contexts but
can potentially integrate them into a broader framework.
Schelling's model might notably accommodate cognitive
hierarchy models (Camerer, Ho, & Chong, 2004), which are
used to explain behavior in p-beauty games, under the cate-
gory of conflict game theory and team-reasoning models
(Bacharach, 1999; Bardsley, Mehta, Starmer, & Sugden,
2010), which apply to coordination games, as an example of
strategy in collaborative contexts.
2. Schelling's model predicts that perceptual and com-
municational elements should influence strategic
reasoning.
Schelling's proposal to include more applied questions of
perception and communication within the framework of
game theory has interesting consequences which deserve to
be explored more thoroughly. It implies first of all a recogni-
tion of the highly context-dependent nature of ecologically
rational heuristics. Insofar as these elements have an infor-
mational or signaling value which players can use to inter-
pret the nature of interaction, they can contribute to trigger
strategic reasoning (does the choice-situation involve mutual
contingency?) and determine which mode of mutually con-
tingent choice applies (is the logic of play dominated by con-
flict, collaboration, or a mix of both?). Experimental
evidence showing that both perception and communication
influence strategic behavior and outcomes can therefore be
tied in to Schelling's model.20 In this respect, it can also
engage with another important aspect of the ecological ratio-
nality program--the role of non-cognitive factors such as
frames and emotions in decision-making--while suggesting
new research questions to investigate--such as the extent to
which the trustworthiness of communication can act as an
indicator of others' intentions and a basis for inferring the
nature of interaction.
3. Perceptual and communicational elements can con-
tribute to social order by extending the logic of mutual
contingency beyond the original class of games
defined as strategic environments in SoC.
Another central assumption of Schelling's model is its
identification of strategic environments with games of
mutual contingency. In this respect, SoC's conclusions could
be summarized as follows: When players need to know what
10 SAGE Open
choices others are making or will make in order to take their
own decisions, they adopt a specific mode of reasoning
which enables them to overcome the coordination problems
that arise in interactive social settings. Interestingly, Schelling
proceeds to extend these conclusions beyond the two-player
games of mutual contingency defined in SoC as "games of
strategy" and on to situations that are marked by wide--
rather than strict--interdependence:
·
· In a first extension, Schelling (1960, pp. 48-52) shows
how signaling can help players achieve cooperation in
a two-player Prisoner's Dilemma. Here, mutually
contingent choice is not a natural feature of the game
but can be imposed on it through the use of strategic
moves which modify the payoff structure.
·
· A second extension of the model consists in using
mutually contingent choice to explain how coopera-
tion emerges in an n-player version of the Prisoner's
Dilemma. This second case is more complex. With a
large number of players involved, the problem of
individual choice with externalities takes on an added
dimension which gives it the characteristic aspect of
a social dilemma. Players have no immediate basis
for strategic reasoning (the n-player Prisoner's
Dilemma is not a game of mutual contingency).
Moreover, they cannot alter the structure of the game
with strategic moves (as in the two-player version of
the game) because they only interact through a com-
mon aggregate that none of them can influence sin-
gle-handedly. Yet even here, Schelling argues that
players engage in coordinated problem-solving and
collective forms of bargaining that can give rise to
"social contracts."21
These extensions of Schelling's model imply that the link
between strategic environments and games of mutual contin-
gency is an analytical rather than a practical one. What
defines a strategic environment is the use of mutually contin-
gent choice as a logic of play, not simply the game's payoff
structure. This logic of play can be sustained by communica-
tional elements (such as strategic moves), as well as by social
objects such as norms or conventions insofar as they trans-
form the way in which players perceive the nature of interac-
tion. In this respect, as Schelling himself suspected, strategic
modes of reasoning and the heuristics of mutually contingent
choice which they rely on may have an important part in the
emergence of cooperation and social order.

Notes
 1. Strategy of Conflict (SoC) tests and demonstrates the extent of
this ability using simple experimental games. Schelling (1960,
p. 57) summarizes the results on tacit coordination as follows:
"People can often concert their intentions or expectations with
others [in pursuit of a common interest] if each knows that
the other is trying to do the same." This conclusion is then
extended to conditions of tacit bargaining (p. 60) where sub-
stantial divergence of interest may exist and, using real-world
examples, to conditions of explicit bargaining (p. 70) where
direct means of communication are available.
 2. Schelling (1960, p. 163): "In a zero-sum game the analyst is
really dealing with only a single center of consciousness, a sin-
gle source of decision. True, there are two players, each with
his own consciousness; but minimax strategy converts the situ-
ation into one involving two essentially unilateral decisions.
[In a non-zero-sum game, by contrast,] two or more centers
of consciousness are dependent on each other in an essential
way. Something has to be communicated; at least some spark
of recognition must pass between the players. There is gener-
ally a necessity for some social activity, however rudimentary
or tacit it may be."
 3. See Mehta, Starmer, and Sugden (1994) for a detailed expla-
nation of what distinguishes salience in Schelling's sense
from ordinary salience and experimental evidence on the role
played by "Schelling salience" in pure-coordination games.
4. Schelling (1960, pp. 88-89) distinguishes cases of pure col-
laboration at one end of the spectrum, in which players' pay-
offs are perfectly and positively correlated and where, for both
players, winning means winning together and never relative to
one another. At the other end of the spectrum are cases of pure
conflict, in which players'payoffs are perfectly, but negatively,
correlated and where the only sense in which a player can win
is relative to--and at the expense of--the other. In between are
what Schelling calls mixed motive cases, in which players are
presented with both commonality and divergence of interest.
Schelling can thus divide game theory into three distinct areas:
a coordination game theory which deals with the strategy of
pure collaboration; an already well-developed conflict game
theory whose object is the strategy of zero-sum games; and a
bargaining game theory which studies the strategy of mixed
motive games. This last class of games represents the most
practically significant, as well as the most widespread case.
Schelling neatly illustrates this by pointing out that what we
typically think of as "conflict" in any domain requires both
commonality and divergence of interest--something to bargain
for collectively and something to bargain over individually.
5. In this respect, I do not consider Schelling primarily as a
critic of game theory, whose contribution comes mainly from
pinpointing the limits inherent to the discipline's deductive
Martin 11
approach to decision-making. Nor would I place Schelling's
theory of interdependent decision outside game theory. This
view of Schelling is defended however by Robert Sugden,
notably in Sugden (1995, pp. 549-550) and Sugden and
Zamarrón (2006, pp. 617-620).
6. On ecological rationality as an offshoot of Herbert Simon's
bounded rationality program, see Gigerenzer (2001, pp. 36-39,
45ff).
7. Schelling (1960, pp. 93fn8, 104-107). It is also interest-
ing to note that the sources Schelling refers to here indicate
close intellectual ties with the bounded rationality program.
Schelling notably quotes Herbert Simon and makes extensive
use of Gestalt psychology--in particular the work of Kurt
Koffka.
 8. Part of the reason mutual perception has been overlooked by
traditional game theory may be due to the fact that it plays no
apparent role in zero-sum games. Indeed, the object of strategy
in zero-sum games consists in thwarting the other's capacity
to perceive our intentions or exploiting that capacity to mis-
lead him. Randomization constitutes the essence of strategy in
zero-sum games precisely because it represents the most effec-
tive way of negating mutual perception.
9. Schelling (1960, p. 150). As McCabe, Smith, and LePore
(2000, p. 4404) put it in very similar language, mind-reading
represents "the capacity to read another person's thoughts or
intentions by placing [oneself] in the position and information
state of the other person." See also Smith (2009, pp. 260-265,
316-317) on the role of mind-reading in strategic interaction
and its importance for the analysis of trust games.
10. On the notion of a theory of mind mechanism and its neuro-
physiological foundations, see Baron-Cohen (1995, 2012),
McCabe et al. (2000), and McCabe, Houser, Ryan, Smith, and
Trouard (2001).
11. Schelling (1960, p. 57): "People can often concert their inten-
tions or expectations with others if each knows that the other
is trying to do the same" (italics added).
12. The Rendez-Vous game is used to illustrate pure collaboration
(Schelling, 1960, pp. 54, 94, 295). The Assurance game is used
to illustrate the problem of surprise attack (Schelling, 1960,
p. 210). A variant of the game of Chicken is presented as part
of Schelling's discussion of problems of symmetry and dis-
crimination in bargaining (Schelling, 1960, p. 286 fn18). The
Matching Pennies game is introduced as a zero-sum "pursuit"
version of Schelling's Holmes/Moriarty coordination problem
(Schelling, 1960, p. 87).
13. Furthermore, these mixed strategy equilibria are often less stable
and less efficient than the conventional solutions achieved by
players in games of mutual contingency using pure strategies--
that is without basing their choice on subjective probabilities.
See for instance Sugden (1986, pp. 40-45) on the limits of mixed
strategies in the context of a game of Chicken.
14. See for instance Walliser (1998, 2003) on the spectrum of
high- and low-rationality solutions game theory has used to
address the problem of interdependent expectations. Dupuy
(1989) argues that "specular" modes of reasoning, which try to
deduce players'expectations from the game's payoff structure,
inevitably degenerate into a game of empty-mirroring, even
under the assumption of common knowledge. Conversely,
"conventional" solutions such as the one proposed by Dupuy,
which allow for the role of social objects as contextual
coordinating principles, generally fail to account for the actual
decision-making process underlying strategic reasoning and
mutually contingent choice.
15. "Environment" must be understood here in a broad sense cov-
ering not only the game and its background but also the players
themselves, as the search for cues can take place both inside
and outside the mind. Memory can be an effective source of
cues in this respect and players can coordinate on the basis of
shared experience or precedent, as well as on the basis of any
element of contextual detail available to them as part of the
game or of its description.
16. Interestingly, the reverse may also be true, in the sense that
mutual contingency might constitute a necessary condition for a
theory of mind mechanism to operate effectively. Players can put
themselves in the place of others, and predict their behavior with
sufficient accuracy to assist decision-making, precisely because
they are doing so within a context where the information struc-
ture is simplified and reduced to the possible set of commonly
perceived cues. The effectiveness of mutual perception and of
the underlying mind-reading ability it relies on may therefore
depend on context. This context-dependent aspect of mind-read-
ing may help explain some of the difficulties encountered when
testing for it empirically. The experimental literature has pre-
sented mixed results on this account. For instance, McCabe et al.
(2000) provide evidence in support of effective mind-reading in
a repeated game of mutual contingency, while Costa-Gomes and
Weizsäcker (2008) find that players have only a limited ability to
predict the behavior of others in a series of one-shot games and,
moreover, that this ability has little impact on decision-making.
17. On search, stop and decision rules as building blocks for sim-
ple heuristics, see Gigerenzer and Selten (2001, pp. 8-9).
18. Vernon Smith proposes a similar reading of Schelling. See for
instance McCabe et al. (2000) and Smith (2009, pp. 264-267).
19. Neuro-imaging studies suggest for instance that failure to
understand mutual contingency due to social cognitive impair-
ment significantly affects the logic and outcome of interaction
in trust games. See McCabe et al. (2001) and Moretto, Sellitto,
and Di Pellegrino (2013).
20. See for instance Burnham, McCabe, and Smith (2000),
Jaworski and Wilson (2013), and Wilson, Jaworski, Schurter,
and Smyth (2012) on players' ability to perceptually trans-
form the nature of interaction in social environments, and
Kimbrough, Smith, and Wilson (2010) on the effects that
informal communication can have on interactive behavior and
outcomes in experimental games.
21. Schelling (2006, p. 224): "[What induces players to cooper-
ate here is not an] enforceable contract, or someone's coercing
them, [but] the belief that if they do others will but not if they
don't, or [ . . . ] a golden rule" (italics added). This solution is
developed in greater detail in Schelling (1973).
