OBJECTIVE -- This study investigated the association between dietary intake of polyunsat-
urated fatty acids (PUFAs) and peripheral neuropathy in the U.S. population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004 for adults 40 years of age with
diagnosed diabetes, an assessment of peripheral neuropathy, and reliable 24-h dietary recall. The
dietary intake of PUFAs was analyzed by peripheral neuropathy status. Multivariate logistic
regression models were used to estimate the odds of having peripheral neuropathy in higher
quintiles of PUFA intake compared with the lowest quintile.
RESULTS -- The mean dietary intake of linolenic acid was 1.25  0.07 g among adults with
peripheral neuropathy, significantly lower than the 1.45  0.05 g intake among those without
peripheral neuropathy. After controlling for potential confounding variables, adults whose lin-
olenic acid intake was in the highest quintile had lower odds of peripheral neuropathy than
adults in the lowest quintile (adjusted odds ratio 0.40 [95% CI 0.21­0.77]).
CONCLUSIONS -- Among adults with diagnosed diabetes, dietary intake of linolenic acid
is positively associated with lower odds of peripheral neuropathy.

The prevalence of peripheral neurop-
athy is 28.5% among adults aged
40 years with diabetes in the U.S.
population (1). Besides improving glyce-
mic control, few available therapeutic
choices for peripheral neuropathy can in-
fluence its natural history (2). Identifica-
tion of additional modifiable factors that
may be related to the progression of pe-
ripheral neuropathy is important. This
study investigated whether dietary poly-
unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake is
associated with measured peripheral
neuropathy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
This study used data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999­2004. The sample in-
cludes 1,062 adults 40 years of age with
self-reported diagnosed diabetes, periph-
eral neuropathy measurement, and com-
plete and reliable 24-h dietary recall data.
Measurements of peripheral
neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy was assessed by
testing foot sensation using a 5.07-gauge
Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilament
(3). Three plantar metatarsal sites (hallux
and first and fifth metatarsal heads) were
tested on each foot in random order. Pe-
ripheral neuropathy was defined as hav-
ing one or more insensate sites (1).
Assessment of PUFA intake
Dietary nutrient intake estimates were ob-
tained from a single in-person interview
of 24-h dietary intake. The NHANES data
files include energy intake, total PUFA in-
take, and intake of seven specific fatty ac-
ids (C18:2, C18:3, C18:4, C20:4, C20:5,
C22:5, and C22:6). Total long-chain
PUFA intake was calculated by summing
intake of PUFAs with 20 carbon atoms.
Use of dietary supplements containing
PUFA in the past 30 days was ascertained
during the household interview (4).
Covariates
The analysis controlled for previously re-
ported risk factors (5­7), namely self-
reported age, sex, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation, smoking status, duration of diabe-
tes, and measured weight, height, blood
pressure, and glycohemoglobin (A1C)
(8,9). High blood pressure was defined as
average systolic blood pressure 140
mmHg or average diastolic blood pres-
sure 90 mmHg. Poor glycemic control
was defined as A1C 7% (10).
Statistics
Descriptive statistics on the dietary intake
of PUFAs and other characteristics were
calculated. Student's t test or 2 test was
used separately for continuous or categor-
ical variables.
The percentages of adults with pe-
ripheral neuropathy in each quintile of

PUFA intake were reported. 2 test was
used to test whether the percentage of
people with peripheral neuropathy differs
by quintiles of PUFA intake. A logistic re-
gression model was used to estimate the
odds of having peripheral neuropathy
among adults in higher PUFA intake
quintiles relative to adults in the lowest
PUFA intake quintile (Q1), first adjusting
for energy intake and then further adjust-
ing for previously identified covariates.
Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN
9.0 (11).
RESULTS
Adults with peripheral neuropathy were
significantly older, taller, and more likely
to be male and had lower education and
longer duration of diabetes than adults
without peripheral neuropathy.
Among adults with peripheral neu-
ropathy, the mean daily total PUFA intake
was 14.60  0.79 g and the mean daily
intake of linolenic acid (C18:3) was
1.25  0.07 g, significantly lower than
the 16.82  0.59 and 1.45  0.05 g re-
spective values among adults without pe-
ripheral neuropathy. Intake of other
PUFAs was not statistically different by
peripheral neuropathy status.
Relative to adults in Q1 of total PUFA
intake, the odds of having peripheral neu-
ropathy was 0.43 (95% CI 0.19­1.00) for
adults in Q5 after adjusting for previously
identified covariates (Table 1). Relative to
adults in Q1 of C18:3 intake, the odds of
having peripheral neuropathy was 0.54
(0.30­0.99) for adults in Q4 and 0.40
(0.21­0.77) for adults in Q5. Logistic
models including and excluding diabetes
duration had virtually identical findings,
suggesting that diabetes duration does
not change the association between PUFA
intake and peripheral neuropathy.
Only 4.04% of adults reported taking
supplements containing PUFAs. The asso-
ciation between taking supplements con-
taining PUFAs and the risk of peripheral
neuropathy was not estimated because of
small sample size. Inclusion of supplement
usageinregressionmodelsdidnotaffectthe
association between dietary PUFA intake
and peripheral neuropathy.
CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to explore whether
high dietary PUFA intake is associated
with lower risk of peripheral neuropathy.
We found that dietary intake of linolenic
acid C18:3 (undifferentiated) is nega-
tively associated with the odds of periph-
eral neuropathy among adults with
diabetes. Studies have shown that -lin-
olenic acid (C18:3 n-6) (GLA) supple-
ments have a protective effect on diabetic
peripheral neuropathy (12­14). How-
ever, GLA is seldom found in foods. The
major form of C18:3 in food is -linolenic
acid (C18:3 n-3) (ALA). Thus, it is reason-
able to expect that the negative associa-
tion between C18:3 and peripheral
neuropathy in this study is due to ALA.
No study has examined the associa-
tion between ALA and diabetic peripheral
neuropathy. However, high dietary intake
of ALA was found to reduce the risk of
coronary heart disease (15­17) and to be
associated with lower risk for hyperten-
sion (18). Vascular factors are important
in the pathogenesis of peripheral neu-
ropathy (2,19). The protective effect of
ALA on macrovascular diseases and its
association with diabetic peripheral
neuropathy may be due to similar bio-
logical mechanisms.
One limitation of this study is that the
PUFA intake was classified based on a sin-
gle 24-h dietary recall. Due to daily vari-
ation in dietary intake, adults may be
misclassified with respect to their usual
PUFA intake, but the effect seems to be
random across the groups. In NHANES,
only tactile peripheral neuropathy is mea-
sured, and the association of PUFAs to
other sensory functions, such as temper-
ature sensitivity, cannot be considered.
However, monofilament is an inexpen-
sive and well-accepted tool for measuring
peripheral neuropathy. It has a sensitivity
of 85­100% and specificity of 76% in pre-
dicting foot ulcer (20).
Identification of prevention methods
for peripheral neuropathy can help reduce
the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy
and its complications. More work is needed
to study the association between ALA and
peripheral neuropathy reported here and to
clarify the biological mechanisms.
