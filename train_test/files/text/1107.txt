Using 1995­1996 data from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Adolescent Health Study, the
authors found that respondents who smoked cigarettes scored, on average, three points higher than did non-
smokers on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale. This gap persists even after ac-
counting for observable factors, such as personal and parental characteristics. In contrast, controlling for the
influence of unobservable factors potentially correlated with smoking behavior and depression produces smaller
estimates. For instance, estimates from a linear regression model augmented with fixed effects suggest that the
average male smoker would score 0.84 points higher on the CES-D Scale (95% confidence interval: 0.44, 1.25)
than his nonsmoking counterpart; the average female smoker is predicted to score 1.25 points higher on the CES-D
Scale (95% confidence interval: 0.75, 1.75) than her nonsmoking counterpart. The authors conclude that, for the
average adolescent, the association between smoking and the symptoms of depression can in large part be
attributed to the influence of unobservable factors.

Many studies have documented a strong association be-
tween smoking and depression (1­8). Two explanations
have traditionally been proposed for this association (9).
The first is that depression leads to smoking, perhaps be-
cause depressed individuals turn to cigarettes as a means of
self-medication; the second is that underlying environmen-
tal or genetic factors predispose individuals to both smoking
and depression.
Recently, however, a third explanation for the association
between smoking and depression has been proposed, namely,
that smoking itself leads to emotional disturbances (10­12).
This explanation is supported by a number of influential
studies on teenagers and, if true, would have enormous im-
plications both because the treatment and consequences of
depression are so costly, and because policymakers would
have a potentially powerful tool to reduce the incidence of
a widespread illness.
Previous researchers in this area have shown that teens
who smoke are at increased risk of subsequently developing
the symptoms of depression (10, 11). This association, how-
ever, could be driven by unobserved (from the standpoint
of the researcher) factors having to do with the home envi-
ronment or with an individual's genetic makeup. In order
to explore the role played by difficult-to-measure environ-
mental and genetic influences potentially correlated with
both smoking and depression, we compare estimates from
standard regression models, which can be thought of as pro-
viding ``nai
¨ve'' estimates of the effect of smoking on de-
pression, with fixed effects estimates that completely
control for time-invariant factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The primary data source for this project is the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the same data
source used by Goodman and Capitman (11) in their influ-
ential study on this topic. Detailed descriptions of the Ado-
lescent Health design and data collection efforts are
published elsewhere (13, 14).

The Adolescent Health Study began with a stratified, ran-
dom sample of all high schools with more than 30 students
in the United States. Eighty high schools were chosen from
this population, and an additional 52 middle or ``feeder''
schools from the same communities were included in the
study. Any student who appeared on the roster of one of
these 132 schools was eligible to participate in the Adoles-
cent Health wave I (baseline) in-home survey. The wave
I in-home interviews were conducted primarily between
May and September of 1995 and produced a nationally rep-
resentative sample of students aged 11­21 years in grades
7 through 12. Wave II (follow-up) in-home interviews were
conducted between April and August of the following year.
The mean period between baseline and follow-up interviews
was 10.9 months.
We analyze data from the wave I and wave II in-home
surveys. These surveys contain good measures of tobacco
use and depressive symptomatology, as well as personal
characteristics, family background variables, and a large ar-
ray of contextual variables that pertain to a respondent's
county and state of residence. To address data confidentially
and security issues and to minimize the potential for inter-
viewer or parental influence, respondents entered their
answers on a laptop computer. For particularly sensitive
questions, the respondent listened to prerecorded questions
through earphones and then directly entered the answers. Of
the 18,924 respondents in the wave I in-home weighed sam-
ple, 13,569 were reinterviewed at follow-up. An additional
501 observations were lost because of missing data (table 1).
Measures
To assess cigarette consumption, the Adolescent Health
survey included the questions, ``[d]uring the past 30 days, on
how many days did you smoke cigarettes?'' and ``[d]uring
the past 30 days, on the days that you smoked, how many
cigarettes did you smoke each day?'' Packs of cigarettes
smoked in the past month were calculated as the product
of the answers to these two questions, divided by 20 (11).
A little more than a quarter of the sample (25.3 percent of
males and 25.8 percent of females) smoked at baseline. By
follow-up, a little over a third of the sample smoked (33.4
percent of males and 33.9 percent of females). These data
are consistent with those from other nationally representa-
tive surveys of adolescent smoking from the mid-1990s
(15). Male smokers at baseline consumed, on average,
9.33 packs per month, while female smokers consumed,
on average, 7.74 packs per month.
To assess depressive symptomatology, the Adolescent
Health in-home survey included 18 of the 20 items that
make up the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
(CES-D) Scale (16). For instance, respondents were asked
how often during the past week they were ``bothered by
things that usually don't bother you,'' how often did they
not ``feel like eating,'' and how often did they feel ``like you
couldn't shake off the blues even with help from your family
or your friends?'' (The two missing items from the CES-D
questionnaire were ``my sleep was restless'' and ``I had
crying spells.'') Each response was coded on a scale of
0­3 based on frequency (0 ¼ rarely or none of the time;
1 ¼ some or a little of the time; 2 ¼ occasionally or a mod-
erate amount of the time; and 3 ¼ most or all of the time),
and adding up these responses produced a score of between
0 and 54 (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.86). To facilitate the compari-
son of our results with those of previous researchers, we
rescaled this score to correspond with the 20-item CES-D
Scale (11). Thus, respondents could be assigned a CES-D
score of between 0 and 60, with higher numbers indicating
the presence of more depressive symptoms.
The primary focus of the present study is not on depres-
sion per se but on its symptoms as measured by the CES-D
Scale. Accordingly, the CES-D score is initially treated as
a continuous variable. However, previous work has shown
that a dichotomized version of the CES-D Scale can be used
as a screening instrument for depression in an adolescent
population, provided that appropriate cutpoints are chosen
(17). Using the cutpoints of Goodman and Capitman (11),
we present additional analyses in which the CES-D score is
dichotomized.
Statistical models
We begin our study by estimating the effect of smoking
on depressive symptomatology using a standard linear re-
gression framework in which the CES-D score of individual
i at follow-up (t ¼ 2) is related to a set of observable factors
and smoking behavior at baseline (t ¼ 1) by the following
equation:
CES-Di; t¼2 ¼ aþbXi; t¼1 þp1si; t¼1
þp2ppmi; t¼1
þei; t¼2; i ¼ 1; ...; n;
ð1Þ
where si, t¼1
is a dichotomous variable equal to one for
youth who smoked at least one cigarette in the 30 days prior
to the baseline interview; ppmi, t¼1
is a measure of smoking
intensity equal to the number of cigarettes smoked in the 30
days prior to the baseline interview, divided by 20; Xi, t¼1
is
a vector of controls that includes measures of age, disability
status, personal and household characteristics, parental ed-
ucation, and a set of county-level variables; and ei, t¼2
is
a random error term. The parameter p1
represents the effect
of baseline smoking participation on the CES-D score at
follow-up (controlling for the variables included in the vec-
tor Xi, t¼1
), and p2
represents the effect of smoking an ad-
ditional pack per month.
Estimating equation 1 using ordinary least squares will
produce unbiased estimates of p1
and p2
if the error term,
ei, t¼2
, is uncorrelated with smoking behavior. However, if
unobservable environmental or genetic factors are corre-
lated with both the CES-D score at follow-up and smoking
behavior, then ordinary least squares estimates will be bi-
ased. Furthermore, because the baseline CES-D score is not
included as an explanatory variable in equation 1, this ap-
proach is subject to a problem of reverse causality: That is,
if preexisting depression leads to smoking at baseline, then
it is inappropriate to interpret ordinary least squares esti-
mates of p1
and p2
as the effect of smoking on depressive
symptomatology.
We address these problems by taking fuller advantage of
the longitudinal nature of the Adolescent Health data by

* Sample weights were used in the calculations. There are 18,924 adolescents in the weighted baseline in-home
survey. Of these, 13,569 were reinterviewed at follow-up. An additional 501 observations were lost because of
missing information on smoking habits, CES-D score, age, or county data. The smoker variables are dichotomous
and equal to one for youth who smoked at least one cigarette in the 30 days prior to being interviewed and zero
otherwise. The packs-per-month variables are equal to the number of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days divided
by 20. The variable, disability, is dichotomous and equal to one for youth that indicated in the baseline interview that
they have difficulty using their hands, arms, legs, or feet because of a permanent physical condition and zero
otherwise. The variables White, Black, and other race are dichotomous, mutually exclusive, and based on a series of
questions from the baseline in-home interview. Hispanic is a dichotomous variable equal to one for youth who self-
identified as being of Hispanic origin and zero otherwise. The household variables are also dichotomous and come
from the questionnaire completed by the respondent's parent/caregiver at baseline. The two-parent home variable
indicates that the parent/caregiver who completed the Adolescent Health parent survey lived with a spouse or
partner at the baseline interview. The welfare variable is equal to one if the parent/caregiver who completed the
Adolescent Health parent survey receives public assistance and zero otherwise. The alcoholic parent variable is
equal to one if either biologic parent currently suffers from alcoholism according to the baseline parent survey and
zero otherwise. The parental education variables are dichotomous, mutually exclusive, and based on the responses
pertaining to the best-educated parent/caregiver living in the household. The county controls are taken from the
Adolescent Health contextual files. The unemployment variable is the county unemployment rate. The rural and
urban variables are the fraction of the county's population that resides in urbanized or rural areas, respectively.

modifying equation 1 to include individual-specific inter-
cepts, often called ``fixed effects'' (18). These fixed effects,
denoted mi
, are incorporated into equation 1 as:
CES-Di; t ¼ aþbXi; t þp1si; t þp2ppmi; t
þmi þei; t; ð2Þ
i ¼ 1; ...; n; t ¼ 1;2:
Each respondent i contributes two observations to the esti-
mation of this model, one from the baseline survey (t ¼ 1)
and the other from the follow-up survey (t ¼ 2). Only the
within-person variation is used to estimate the parameters of
equation 2. All time-invariant factors (such as preexisting
depression, basic personality traits, and family background)
are controlled for by the fixed effects (18). However, fixed
effects do not control for omitted time-variant factors, such
as the respondent's emotional state. If the correlation be-
tween smoking and CES-D scores is driven in part by
difficult-to-measure factors that vary between the baseline
and follow-up interviews, then this estimation strategy is
likely to produce an upper-bound estimate of the effect of
smoking on depressive symptomatology.
The fixed effects approach can also be used when the
dependent variable is dichotomous. Following previous re-
search, we create a high depressive symptomatology vari-
able that is equal to one for youth scoring above a cutpoint
on the CES-D Scale, and zero otherwise (11). The cutpoint
for females is 24; for males, the cutpoint is 22. The logistic
model is derived by assuming that the probability that re-
spondent i scores above the cutpoint at the follow-up in-
terview takes the following form:
Pi; t¼2 ¼
expðbXi; t¼1 þpsi; t¼1Þ
1þexpðbXi; t¼1 þpsi; t¼1Þ
; i ¼ 1; ...; n; ð3Þ
where Xi, t¼1
and Si, t¼1
are defined as they are in equation 1.
Solving equation 3 leads to the log odds ratio:
log
Pi; t¼2
1ÿPi; t¼2
 
¼ bXi; t¼1 þpsi; t¼1; i ¼ 1; ...; n: ð4Þ
The parameter p represents the effect of baseline smoking
participation on the follow-up log odds ratio (controlling for
the variables included in the vector Xi, t¼1
). The parameters
in equation 4 are estimated by maximizing the log likeli-
hood function:
log L ¼

where di, t
is a dichotomous variable equal to one if i
scores above the depressive cutpoint at interview t, and
zi; t
¼ bXi; t
þ psi; t
:
However, if smoking behavior is correlated with unobserv-
able factors, then the parameter estimates from equation 5
will be biased in the same way that the ordinary least squares
estimates are biased. One solution is to once again take ad-
vantage of the longitudinal nature of the Adolescent Health
data by modifying equation 4 to include individual-specific
intercepts. Including individual fixed effects in the logistic
model leads to a log odds ratio of the following form:

In general, fixed effects binary choice models suffer from the
incidental parameters problem (19). However, Chamberlain

estimated, without the need to estimate mi

is analogous to the traditional fixed effects model in that it

factors but does not control for unobserved time-variant
factors.

a mean score of 9.96 (95 percent CI: 9.77, 10.16) for males
who did not smoke at baseline. The mean follow-up CES-D

Ordinary least squares estimates
Although statistically significant at conventional levels,
these differences may simply be a reflection of factors that
are easily observed and measured by the researcher. If so,
they can be accounted for using a standard regression frame-
work in which the CES-D score at follow-up is a function of
baseline smoking behavior and a set of controls also observ-
able at baseline.
Table 3 presents ordinary least squares estimates of the
effect of smoking on depressive symptoms by gender. As
noted above, ordinary least squares estimates are subject to
a variety of limitations and are presented for comparison
purposes only.
Smoking participation by males is associated with a 2.85
increase in the CES-D score, and each additional pack per
month is associated with an increase of 0.01 in the CES-D
score, although this latter effect is not statistically significant
at conventional levels. These estimates suggest that a male

smoking 9.33 packs per month (the baseline average) would
score 2.90 points higher (95 percent CI: 2.19, 3.61; p < 0.001)
on the CES-D Scale than would a comparable nonsmoker.
For females, smoking participation is associated with
a 2.92-point increase in the CES-D score, and each addi-
tional pack is associated with an increase of 0.06 in the
CES-D score. These estimates suggest that a female smok-
ing 7.74 packs per month (the baseline average) would score
3.39 points higher (95 percent CI: 2.65, 4.12; p < 0.001) on
the CES-D Scale than would a comparable nonsmoker.
Adding fixed effects to the linear regression model
Table 4 presents estimates of the linear regression model
augmented with fixed effects. The results indicate that sim-
ple ordinary least squares may substantially overstate the
relation between smoking and the symptoms of depression.
For males, smoking participation is associated with a 0.66-
point increase in the CES-D score, and each additional pack
per month is associated with a 0.02 increase in the CES-D
score. These estimates suggest that a male smoking 9.33
packs per month (the baseline average) would score 0.84
points higher on the CES-D Scale (95 percent CI: 0.44, 1.23;
p < 0.001) than would a comparable nonsmoker, a number
that is less than one third the size of the corresponding
ordinary least squares estimate. For females, smoking par-
ticipation is associated with a 1.16-point increase in the
CES-D score, and each additional pack per month is asso-
ciated with a 0.01 increase in the CES-D score. A female
smoking 7.74 packs per month (the baseline average) is
predicted to score 1.25 points higher (95 percent CI: 0.75,
1.75; p < 0.001) than a comparable female nonsmoker,
a number that is approximately one third the size of the
corresponding ordinary least squares estimate.

cent CI: 5.31, 6.66) of nonsmokers. Among females, 17.64
percent (95 percent CI: 15.76, 19.51) of smokers exhibited
high depressive symptomatology, compared with 9.35 per-
cent (95 percent CI: 8.56, 10.15) of nonsmokers. These
differences correspond to unadjusted odds ratios of 2.86
(95 percent CI: 2.24, 3.65) and 2.07 (95 percent CI: 1.69,
2.55) for males and females, respectively.
Table 6 shows estimates from the standard logistic model.
Smoking participation by males is associated with almost
a threefold increase in the odds of exhibiting high depressive
symptomatology (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.73, 95 percent CI:
2.05, 3.65; p < 0.001), controlling for observable factors.
For females, smoking is associated with a twofold increase
in these odds (OR ¼ 2.12, 95 percent CI: 1.74, 2.75; p <
0.001).
Adding fixed effects to the logistic model substantially
reduces the estimated impact of smoking for males but not
for females (table 7). Specifically, smoking among males is
associated with a statistically insignificant 0.05 increase in
the odds of exhibiting high depressive symptomatology
(OR ¼ 1.05, 95 percent CI: 0.77, 1.43; p ¼ 0.77). Among

DISCUSSION
Researchers have linked depression to bad grades (20),
low self-esteem (21, 22), and other mental problems such as
anxiety disorders (23­25). Depression has also been linked
to an increased likelihood of substance use, including alco-
hol, marijuana, and cocaine (2, 5, 26). Many of these factors
are potentially causes, as opposed to consequences, of emo-
tional disturbances among teens, but the possibility that
tobacco use leads to depression has, to date, received the
most attention. Although nobody is certain of the physio-
logic mechanism, nicotine exposure has been cited as a pos-
sible culprit because nicotine has been shown to influence
the ``neurochemical systems that may play an etiologic role
in MD [major depression]'' (6, p. 36). For instance, there is
evidence that nicotine leads to impaired serotonin function
among individuals who have been diagnosed with a depres-
sive disorder (27). In addition, there has been speculation
that smoking may increase the likelihood of developing
anxiety disorders by reducing oxygen flow to the brain (12).
If it could be confirmed that smoking is a contributing
factor to depression in a causal sense, this would represent
an important step toward identifying the physical process
that produces depression. Moreover, it could provide useful
information to policymakers and health specialists inter-
ested in reversing the upswing in youth smoking that oc-
curred during the 1990s. According to data from national
surveys such as the Monitoring the Future survey, the in-
cidence of smoking among high school students grew dra-
matically between 1991 and 1997, although it has been
suggested that recent increases in the price of cigarettes
may have the effect of reversing this upward trend (15). If
increases in the price of cigarettes also have the effect of
reducing depression among high school students, this would
be welcome news indeed.
Previous research in this area clearly indicates that ado-
lescents who smoke are at higher risk of subsequently
developing the symptoms of depression (10, 11). This asso-
ciation, however, could be driven by underlying influences
related to the home environment or an individual's genetic
predisposition to depression. Previous researchers have typ-
ically examined the predictors of adolescent smoking in
order to rule out this possibility. For instance, Goodman
and Capitman (11), using data from the Adolescent Health
study, found that teens with CES-D scores above a certain
cutpoint were no more likely to start smoking than were
teens below the cutpoint. However, Goodman and Capitman
included a number of covariates in their model that may
indicate depression (e.g., grade point average, alcohol use,
previous smoking, measures of delinquency and self-esteem,
and parental perceptions of the respondent's behavior). If
one is interested in ruling out the possibility that depression
affects whether a teen takes up smoking, then it is inappro-
priate to control for potential indicators of depression.
The results of the present study confirm that smokers tend
to exhibit more symptoms of depression than do non-
smokers. Female respondents to the Adolescent Health sur-
vey who smoked at baseline scored, on average, 3.31 points
higher on the CES-D Scale at follow-up than did their non-
smoking counterparts. Male smokers scored, on average,
3.11 points higher on the CES-D Scale at follow-up than
did their nonsmoking counterparts.
Although observable factors, such as personal and paren-
tal characteristics, have been shown to be important predic-
tors of adolescent depressive symptoms (28­33), they do not
fully explain these differences. In fact, when age, race,
household variables, parental education, urban/rural status,
and the county-level unemployment rate are controlled for
in a linear regression framework, the average female is pre-
dicted to score 3.39 points higher on the CES-D Scale than
is her nonsmoking counterpart. The average male smoker is
predicted to score 2.90 points higher on the CES-D Scale
than is his nonsmoking counterpart.
In contrast, controlling for unobservable factors dramat-
ically reduces the estimated effect of smoking. After the
addition of fixed effects to the linear regression model, the
average female smoker is predicted to score 1.25 points
higher on the CES-D Scale than is her nonsmoking coun-
terpart, while the average male smoker is predicted to score
0.84 points higher on the CES-D Scale than is his nonsmok-
ing counterpart. These estimates suggest that smoking has,
at most, an extremely modest impact on depressive symp-
tomatology. To put them in perspective, it might be noted
that, if a respondent changed his or her answer from
``rarely'' to ``some of the time'' on only one of the 18 items
that make up the Adolescent Health version of the CES-D
Scale, this would result in an increase of 2.2 points in his or
her score.

* The dichotomous dependent variable is equal to one for
individuals scoring above the depression cutpoint on the Center for

cutpoints are 22 for males and 24 for females. Each respondent
contributes two observations to the estimation of this model (one from
the baseline survey and the other from the follow-up survey). Age is
not captured by the individual fixed effects, because the time
between the baseline and follow-up interviews was not uniform
across respondents. All other baseline control variables are absorbed
by the individual fixed effects.

Yet there is reason to believe that even these modest
estimates might overstate the effect of smoking on depres-
sive symptoms. If a physiologic link indeed exists between
smoking and the subsequent development of depression,
then it would be reasonable to expect that evidence of this
link would become more pronounced as the number of cig-
arettes consumed increases. In fact, we find very little evi-
dence that smoking intensity (as measured by packs smoked
per month) is related to the depressive symptomatology of
smokers. After the addition of fixed effects to the linear
regression model, smoking an extra pack of cigarettes per
month is associated with a 0.02 increase in male CES-D
scores, an estimate that is small relative to the impact of
participation and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
For females, smoking an extra pack of cigarettes per month
is associated with a statistically insignificant 0.01 increase
in CES-D scores.
It is difficult to reconcile these estimates with the notion
that smoking causes depression, although it is possible that
smoking has different effects depending on the level of de-
pressive symptomatology. The linear regression model, with
or without fixed effects, produces estimates of the impact of
smoking on the mean CES-D score. In contrast, previous
researchers have focused on whether respondents scored
above a cutpoint set at a value greater than the mean (3, 8,
11). For instance, Goodman and Capitman (11) investigated
the impact of smoking on ``high depressive symptomatol-
ogy'' with cutpoints set at approximately the 90th percentile
of the CES-D distribution.
Using the cutpoints of Goodman and Capitman, we in-
vestigated the relation between smoking participation and
a dichotomized version of the CES-D Scale. In order to keep
our results comparable with those of previous researchers
who used logistic modeling, smoking intensity is not in-
cluded as a predictor of scoring above the cutpoints. This
approach is consistent with our finding that smoking inten-
sity is unrelated to the CES-D.
For males, the logistic results are in keeping with those
discussed above. That is, controlling for observable charac-
teristics, such as age, race, and parental education, has little
impact on the estimated effect of smoking, but adding fixed
effects to the standard logistic model produces an estimated
odds ratio that is statistically indistinguishable from unity.
For females, we find that logistic modeling produces sim-
ilar estimates with or without fixed effects. According to the
standard logistic model estimates, the odds of scoring above
the cutpoint are 2.19 times greater for female smokers than
for their nonsmoking counterparts. Adding fixed effects re-
duces the estimated odds ratio to 1.79.
Given this latter result, we cannot rule out the possibility
that smoking has an effect on the likelihood that female
adolescents exhibit high levels of depressive symptomatol-
ogy. However, as noted in Materials and Methods, adding
fixed effects produces what is likely to be upper-bound es-
timates for the effect of smoking. The true effect of smoking
on the odds that a female adolescent scored above the cut-
point used by Goodman and Capitman is probably smaller
than that reported.
The statistical techniques used in this analysis are de-
signed to produce results comparable with what might be
expected from a classically designed, randomized experi-
ment. They are, however, subject to a variety of limitations
to which randomized experiments are not. For instance, the
inclusion of fixed effects produces unbiased estimates only
if the unobservables being controlled for are constant with
respect to time. Because unobservables are, by definition,
difficult to measure or even characterize, this assumption
remains untested.
In addition, including fixed effects does not absolve the
researcher from making assumptions with regard to model
specification. By exploring the impact of fixed effects in the
context of both linear and nonlinear models, we tested the
robustness of our estimates to underlying structural and dis-
tributional assumptions. Although more work needs to be
done in this area, we view our results as evidence of the
important role played by unobservable environmental and
genetic factors in the determination of adolescent depres-
sion. We conclude that, for the average adolescent, the as-
sociation between smoking and the symptoms of depression
can in large part be attributed to the influence of unobserv-
able factors.
