Abstract
Background:Accuratedataon the prevalenceof
blindness in urban populations is not readily
available. The Australian Longitudinal Study of
Ageing is a prospective multidimensional study
examining a broad range of age-related health
issues,includingvisualfunction.
Methods: A population-based sample of 1466
persons, 70 years of age and over, from the
Adelaide metropolitanarea underwentvisual acuity
measurements.
Results: Approximately 1% were legally blind by
Australiandefinitions.
Conclusions: This percentage is low by world
standards, however projections indicate that the
absolute number of blind elderly people is rapidly
increasing. Data such as this are crucial for the
planningof adequate ophthalmic care.
Keywords: Blindness,elderly,survey.
In Australia, blindness is defined as a visual
acuity of less than 6/60 in the better eye. The
precise prevalence of blindness in Australia is
notknown. Attemptshavebeen made toestimate
the prevalence of blindness in several
industrialised countries using indirect data from
blindness registries or social security records,
however the limitations of such data are
recognised.'-'It is apparent that the vast majority
of blindness occurs in the elderly (greater than
or equalto 70 years of age).' Population-based
data on the prevalence of blindness and visual
impairmentin industrialisednationsisnotreadily
a~ailable.~
We present data from the Australian
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA) which
may more accurately reflect the prevalence of
blindness in the elderly Australian population.

and its design included both survey and

population was all persons 70 years of age and
over living in the Adelaide Statistical Division.
The primary sample consisted of 3263 people
greaterthanorequal to 70years of age randomly
selected from the South Australian Electoral
Data Base,representing approximately 3.6% of
the target population. This primary sample was
stratified to provide estimated equal numbers in
five-year age and sex groups. Males were
deliberately over-represented to compensate for
higher mortality over the study period. There
were 1477willing,eligiblerespondentsrecruited
from the primary sample with an additional 610
responding coresidents. A portion of these
coresidents were between 65 and 70 years of
age. This small portion has not been included in
this study.One thousand nine hundred and forty-
seven participants were aged 70years and over.
From this group of participants, 1446agreed
to undergo a clinical assessment which included
distance visual acuity measurement. (Table 1)
Clinical assessment was conducted in the
participants' homes by trained staff. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
Distance visual acuity was measured at three
metresusing a suitable,well-illuminatedSnellen
chart. Uncorrected visual acuity was measured
in each eye followed by corrected visual acuity
in each eye. Corrected visual acuity was
measured using the participants' current

participants' current near correction was
measured in 1321 participants with a test type
approved by the Faculty of Ophthalmologists.
Visual acuity beyond 6/60 was not classified
further and as the clinical assessment was not
primarily directed at vision, no further
ophthalmic examinationwas conducted.

Seventeenpersons ( 1.2%)were found to have

blindness, defined as corrected visual acuity of
<6/60 in their worst eye. Ninety-five (6.6%)had
binocular low vision defined as corrected visual
acuity of <6/18, but greater than or equal to
6/60 in each eye. One hundred and thirty four

the data, giving an estimate for the prevalence
of binocular blindness in males as 1.O% and for
females 0.7%.
The age and sex distribution of the legally
blind participants is shown in Table 3. The
greater percentage of legally blind males is not
statistically significant. There is a statistically
significant greater prevalence of blindness in
those aged 80 years and over compared to the
younger agegroups (P<O.OOl). The age and sex
distribution of the participants with monocular
blindness is shown inTable4.There was a strong
tendency towards a predominance of males in
most age groups, however this gender
discrepancy was not statistically significant
(P>0.05). Monocular blindness was
significantly more common in the participants
aged 80 years and over (P<0.05).The age and

an elderlyAustralian urban community. Despite
an inevitable component of self-selection
involving those participants from the primary
sample who underwent visual acuity
measurements,we believe that the weighted data
gives a reasonable point prevalence estimate of
legal blindness in the target population.
In 1981, Banks and Hutton used various
indirect sources including the Department of
Social Security and in particular data from the
National Trachoma and Eye Health Programme
to estimate the overall prevalence of legal
blindness as approximately 0.14% to 0.19% in
New South Wales.' Data from the Department
of Social Security indicate that 945 people 70
yearsof ageandover inJune 1994wereinreceipt
of a pension granted on the grounds of an
incapacitating visual deficit. This represents
approximately 0.74% of the elderly South
Australian population. Interestingly, this figure
is compatible with the ALSA data.
A prevalence survey of eye disease in
Leicestershire using participants aged 75 years
and over found that 3.8% of the 529participants
had a visual acuity of less than or equal to 6/60
in the better eye.6This figure is approximately
twice that of the comparable ALSA data. The
Baltimore Eye Survey found that 0.63% of the
70 to 79 year old Caucasian population had a
visual acuity of lessthan or equal to 6/60 in the
better eye. In the same group aged 80years and
over 7.28% had a visual acuity of less than or
equal to 6/60 in the better eye.4An explanation
for the considerable increase in the prevalence
of blindness in this age group was not offered.
Fortunately, such a marked age-related increase
is not present in the ALSA sample, perhaps
reflecting a better delivery of health care to our
elderly population. A standardwhich is achieved
at considerable expense to society.
The ALSA data indicate a considerable level
of visual impairment and low vision within the
elderly population. Approximately 9.3% of the
sample population was visually impaired, as
recognised by the WHO criteria. It is possible
that a refractive problem contributed to this
impairment, however elucidation of aetiolgy
requires a more detailed study.
In relation to prevalence and causes of
blindness, the underdeveloped countries have
received more attentionthan their industrialised
counterparts. Numerous population-based
studies examining the prevalence of blindness
and low vision in African countries have been
c ~ n d u c t e d . ~ . ~
They reveal a prevalence of
blindness (WHO definition:visual acuity <3/60
in the better eye)of approximately 10%to 20%
in the elderly population. The majority have
treatable disease. Comparatively,the prevalence
of blindness in our elderly population is much
lower, however we have at least a three-fold
increase in the percentage of population aged
over 70 years. Data from the Australian Bureau
of Statistics indicates that currently
approximately 10%of the Australian population
is in this age group. In the year 2001 there will
be 12%and by 2021 the proportion will be 15%
to 16%.The corresponding projections are even
higher for South Australia alone. Given the
current data we can expect approximately 1%
of this group to be legally blind. In addition,the
group aged over 80years, in which blindness is
relatively more common, is the most rapidly
growing subgroupof the population. Further,the
majority of blindness in this agegroup is caused
by age-related macular degeneration and is
therefore largely untreatable.6
Blindness is not only a personal tragedy, but
also a considerable social burden. It is clear that
242 Australian and New ZealandJournal of Ophthalmology 1996;24(3)
this burden is increasing. Accurate data is
essential in order to plan and provide adequate
health care for our blind elderly population.
Given the current paucity of information
concerning the aetiology and demography of
blindness in our community further studies in
this area would greatly enhance the current data.
