Abstract
Objective: To investigate prospectively the insulin dose requirements of Chinese patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with either multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy during a 2-week therapeutic intervention.
Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to MDI or CSII therapy.
The effects of the two treatment methods were determined based on blood glucose parameters,
total daily insulin dose and rates of hypoglycaemia.
Results: A total of 609 patients were enrolled in the study. Glycaemic goals were achieved after a
mean Æ SD of 6.90 Æ 2.10 and 5.44 Æ 2.22 days' treatment in the MDI and CSII groups, respectively.
Once stabilized, the mean Æ SD total daily insulin doses were 37.12 Æ 10.19 IU and 32.58 Æ 8.78 IU
for the MDI and CSII groups, respectively. Once stabilized, the mean Æ SD total basal and bolus
doses were 19.46 Æ 7.95 IU/day and 17.66 Æ 3.53 IU/day for the MDI group, and 22.79 Æ 7.55 IU/
day and 9.81 Æ 2.64 IU/day for the CSII group, respectively. There were significant differences in the
total, basal and bolus insulin doses between the two groups.
Conclusion: CSII therapy may be considered as an effective method to achieve good glycaemic
control in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Date received: 8 January 2014; accepted: 8 April 2014
Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by
the progressive loss of functional insulin-
producing b-cells and the persistence of
insulin resistance.1 The deterioration of
b-cell function has been recognized as a
major problem in Chinese patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus,2 resulting in insulin
treatment being utilized as the major ther-
apy. At present, although substantial pro-
gress has been made in insulin preparation
and medication, insulin administered via
subcutaneous injection still falls short of
what is achieved by physiologically-secreted
insulin. Furthermore, insulin therapy can
cause hypoglycaemia, weight increase and
iatrogenic hyperinsulinaemia, all of which
may increase the risk of vascular disease and
insulin resistance.3,4 Therefore, greater
attention should be given to the insulin
dose used in the treatment of patients with
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
It has been reported that patients with
type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) need a
lower dose of insulin, compared with those
receiving multiple daily injections (MDI).5­7
Evidence suggests that CSII also appears to
be a good alternative for the treatment of
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do
not respond to MDI regimens.8 In China,
neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH)-based
MDI and CSII methods for glycaemic con-
trol are routinely used for hospitalized
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
However, there are insufficient numbers of
relevant studies discussing the optimal insu-
lin dose for Chinese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus. Therefore, this study
investigated the insulin dose requirements
of hospitalized Chinese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus who were treated with
MDI or CSII therapy for 2 weeks.
Patients and methods
Patients
This randomized prospective clinical trial
enrolled Chinese patients with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus who were hospitalized in the
Department of Endocrinology, Linyi
People's Hospital, Linyi, Shandong
Province, China between January 2010 and
July 2012. All patients signed the consent
form to participate in the research. This
study was approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of Linyi People's Hospital (ref-
erence number: 2010089).
Inclusion criteria
The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was
established on the basis of the 1999 Diabetes
Diagnostic Criteria of the World Health
Organization.9 Patients were hospitalized
for insulin therapy due to poor glycaemic
control. The inclusion criteria were as fol-
lows: (i) diabetes symptoms (e.g. polyuria,
polydipsia and unexplained weight loss) plus
a random venous plasma glucose concentra-
tion >11.1 mmol/l or a fasting plasma glu-
cose concentration >7.0 mmol/l (whole
blood >6.1 mmol/l), or 2-h plasma glucose
concentration >11.1 mmol/l at 2 h after 75 g
anhydrous glucose in an oral glucose toler-
ance test (2-h PBG); (ii) with no symptoms,
diagnosis was not based on a single glucose
determination but required confirmatory
plasma venous determination. At least one
additional glucose test result on another day
(fasting, from a random sample or from the
2-h post-glucose load) with a value in the
diabetic range was essential. If the fasting or
Yang et al. 1003
random values were not diagnostic, the 2-h
value was used.
Exclusion criteria
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i)
patients prescribed other oral hypogly-
caemic agents, except for metformin; (ii)
patients with acute complications such as
diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemic
hyperosmolar status and diabetic lactic
acidosis, severe or significant hepatic or
renal impairment, pregnancy, malignancy,
or acute infection; (iii) late-onset type 1
diabetes as indicated by a positive result for
islet-cell antibodies, glutamic acid decarb-
oxylase antibodies or tyrosine phosphatase
antibodies, and a decrease in the serum
C-peptide level.
Groups and treatment
Patients were randomly divided into either
the MDI or CSII group based on their
hospitalization number, using a random
allocation sequence (generated using a
random-number table). Odd numbers were
assigned to the MDI group; even numbers
were assigned to the CSII group.
The initial insulin dose for all study
participants was 0.3­0.4 IU/kg per day,
irrespective of the route of administration.
The patients in the MDI group were injected
subcutaneously (s.c.) with short-acting
human insulin (biosynthetic human insulin;
Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark)
before meals, three times daily, as well as
receiving NPH insulin s.c. twice-daily (Novo
Nordisk). The initial NPH dose accounted
for 60% of the total daily dose, and the
short-acting human insulin accounted for
the remaining 40%. Patients in the CSII
group were treated with insulin aspart
(Novo Nordisk), using Medtronic
(Northridge, CA, USA) insulin pumps. In
the CSII group, the initial basal dose
accounted for 60% of the total daily
amount, and was divided into four periods:
00:00­04:00 h, 04:00­09:00 h, 09:00­21:00 h,
21:00­24:00 h. The pre-meal dose accounted
for the remaining 40% and was distributed
into three pre-meal doses. These treatment
regimens were undertaken for 2 weeks.
Blood glucose was monitored by finger-
stick blood samples eight times per day
(before the three meals and 2 h later, and
at 22:00 h and 03:00 h) using a stable blood
glucose monitoring device from LifeScan
(Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, CA, USA).
Each patient's diet was adjusted according
to the Chinese Guidelines for type 2 diabetes
mellitus (reference/source not available).
The basal insulin dose was preferentially
adjusted to control the blood glucose level
when the pre-meal blood glucose was
>9 mmol/l or the postprandial blood glu-
cose was <6 mmol/l.10,11 After achieving
stabilized glycaemic control for 3 days, the
daily insulin dose was adjusted when the
pre-meal and postprandial glucose levels
were <7.00 mmol/l and 11.10 mmol/l,
respectively.
Hypoglycaemia was deEned as blood
glucose 3.9 mmol/l and the symptoms of
hypoglycaemia were resolved by the admin-
istration of oral carbohydrates, or a decrease
of basal insulin or regular insulin doses
based on the pre-meal and postprandial
glucose levels. Unconfirmed symptomatic
hypoglycaemia, nocturnal hypoglycaemic
episodes and severe hypoglycaemic episodes
were not specifically recorded.
Clinical measurements
Baseline clinical and demographic data for
all of the study participants were collected
from the medical records. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height
(m2). Venous blood samples were obtained
from all of the participants after 8-h fasting
and treated separately. All samples for
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c
) deter-
mination were anticoagulated with
1004 Journal of International Medical Research 42(4)
1.8 mg/ml ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid
and tested using an autoanalyser (D-10TM
Hemoglobin Testing System; BIO-RAD,
Hercules, CA, USA). Additional blood
samples were clotted at room temperature
for 15­20 min and then serum was obtained
by centrifugation at >1000 g for 15 min at
2­8C. These serum samples were used for
the determination of fasting serum C-pep-
tide levels, using an ADVIA CentaurÕ CP
Immunoassay System (Siemens Healthcare,
Erlangen, Germany). Capillary whole-blood
samples collected after 8-h fasting were used
for the determination of fasting blood glu-
cose (FBG) concentrations using a
ContourÕ blood glucose meter (Bayer,
Whippany, NJ, USA).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 13.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Quantitative data were
expressed as mean Æ SD. Variables were
compared between the MDI and CSII
groups using an independent Student's
t-test for continuous variables and 2-test
for categorical variables. A P-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 609 Chinese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (328 male; 281 female)
were enrolled in the study; 303 (159 male;
144 female) were randomized to the MDI
group and 306 (169 male; 137 female) were
randomized to the CSII group (Figure 1).
There were 108 (35.6%) and 110 (35.9%)
newly diagnosed patients who had not
received prior insulin treatment in the
MDI and CSII groups, respectively. There
were no significant differences in the baseline
age, sex distribution, proportion of newly
diagnosed patients, duration of diabetes,
BMI, HbA1c
, FBG, 2-h PBG and fasting
serum C-peptide levels between the MDI
and CSII groups (Table 1).
In the MDI group, 137 patients received
insulin therapy alone and 166 patients
received insulin in combination with met-
formin (mean Æ SD insulin dose:
0.58 Æ 0.18 IU/kg per day; mean Æ SD total
daily insulin dose: 37.12 Æ 10.19 IU). The
mean Æ SD total daily basal and bolus insu-
lin doses were 19.46 Æ 7.95 IU and
17.66 Æ 3.53 IU, respectively
(50.90 Æ 8.32% and 49.10 Æ 8.32% of the
total daily dose, respectively).
In the CSII group, 149 patients received
insulin therapy alone and 157 received insu-
lin in combination with metformin
(mean Æ SD insulin dose: 0.48 Æ 0.17 IU/kg
per day; mean Æ SD total daily insulin dose:
32.57 Æ 8.78 IU). The mean Æ SD total daily
basal and bolus insulin doses were
22.79 Æ 7.55 IU and 9.81 Æ 2.64 IU, respect-
ively (69.03 Æ 7.00% and 30.97 Æ 7.00% of
the total daily dose, respectively). There
were significant differences in the total,
basal, and bolus insulin doses between the
two groups (P < 0.01; Figure 2; Table 2).
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was 5.94%
(18/303) in the MDI group and 1.63%
(5/306) in the CSII group (P < 0.01). There
were no serious adverse events recorded.
Discussion
Many studies have demonstrated that CSII
therapy is more effective than MDI therapy
in the treatment of patients with type 1
diabetes mellitus because CSII therapy can
reduce the insulin dose required to achieve
optimal glycaemic control.5,6,12­14 In the
present study, results showed that CSII
therapy could also significantly reduce the
total daily insulin dose compared with MDI
therapy in Chinese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus. The incidence of hypogly-
caemia during CSII therapy was also sig-
nificantly lower than that during MDI
therapy.
Yang et al. 1005
Studies have shown that short-acting
insulin analogues improve glycaemic control
without increasing insulin dose in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus, meaning that
they can provide the same degree of gly-
caemic control with lower doses of insu-
lin.15,16 Research has also focused on the
drug delivery method. For example, Phillip
et al.17 showed that the initial insulin dose
(IU/kg) in MDI therapy, in patients with
type 1 diabetes mellitus, was significantly
reduced after switching to CSII therapy. In
contrast, a meta-analysis of insulin replace-
ment in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus found that, compared with MDI,
there was no difference in the daily insulin
dose with CSII.18 Similarly, a study carried
out in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus did not show a significant difference
in the total daily insulin dose between MDI
and CSII methods.19 In this present study,
the results showed that the mean Æ SD
insulin dose per unit body weight for the
MDI group (0.58 Æ 0.18 IU/kg per day) was
significantly higher than that for the CSII
group (0.48 Æ 0.17 IU/kg per day; P < 0.01),
which suggests that compared with CSII
therapy, the regulation of the basal dose
with MDI therapy was not optimal. These
data therefore indicate that CSII therapy
may be more effective than MDI therapy for
Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus.
Postprandial blood glucose is affected by
three factors: FBG, glycogen output and the
absorption of intestinal glucose. In general,

the increase of 2-h PBG is led by the
elevation of glycogen output and absorption
of gastrointestinal glucose. In healthy sub-
jects and patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus, the gastrointestinal absorption of
glucose is analogous,20 and one of the roles
of basal insulin is to restrain the output of
glycogen.21 Basal insulin not only reduces
FBG and pre-meal blood glucose, but also
partially restrains postprandial hypergly-
caemia. When basal insulin treatment is
used to reduce 2-h PBG, a lower dose of
pre-meal insulin is required as a supplement
to control 2-h PBG. However, pre-meal
insulin treatment only restrains the glycogen
output and absorption-related increase of
glucose. The Henry activity curve for insulin
suggests that the higher the concentration of
pre-meal insulin, the greater its effect on
reducing non-meal blood glucose, and the
stronger the `tail effect' on pre-meal glucose
levels.22 A lower pre-meal dose of insulin
can reduce the additive effect of the basal
dose and thereby avoid modulating the
basal dose. Suzuki et al.23 showed that
increasing the basal insulin dose might be a
useful way to control FBG and HbA1c
in
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose
basal insulin was switched from NPH insu-
lin to insulin glargine. In this present study,
the total daily basal insulin dose was signifi-
cantly higher in the CSII group than in the
MDI group, demonstrating the advantage
of CSII therapy.
In this present study, at least during a
short-term 2-week therapeutic intervention,
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated
with MDI showed a significantly higher
total daily insulin requirement, a longer
duration to achieve the target glycaemic
control, and a higher incidence of hypogly-
caemia compared with patients treated with
CSII therapy. Therefore, CSII therapy may
be considered as an effective method to
achieve good glycaemic control, with a
lower total daily insulin dose due to an
