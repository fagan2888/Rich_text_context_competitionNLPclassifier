Abstract
Background: Persons held in correctional facilities are at high risk for HIV infection and their prevalence of HIV is
substantially higher than in the general population. Thus, the need for proper surveillance and care of this high risk
population is a paramount public health issue. This study aims to evaluate an organization-level intervention
strategy for improving HIV services for persons in prison or jail.
Methods/Design: HIV Services and Treatment Implementation in Corrections (HIV-STIC) is using a cluster
randomized trial design to test an organization-level intervention designed to implement improvements in
preventing, detecting, and treating HIV for persons under correctional supervision. Matched pairs of prison or jail
facilities were randomized using a SAS algorithm. Facility staff members in both Experimental and Control
conditions involved in HIV service delivery are recruited to receive training on HIV infection, the HIV services
continuum, and relevant web-based resources. Staff members in both conditions are tasked to implement
improvements in HIV prevention, testing, or treatment in their facility. In the Control condition facilities, staff
participants use existing techniques for implementing improvement in a selected area of HIV services. In contrast,
the Experimental condition staff participants work as a Local Change Team (LCT) with external coaching and use a
structured process improvement approach to improve a selected part of the HIV services continuum. The
intervention period is 10 months during which data are obtained using survey instruments administered to staff
members and aggregate services delivery data. The study is being implemented in 13 pairs of correctional facilities
across nine states in the US. Experimental sites are hypothesized to show improvements in both staff attitudes
toward HIV services and the number and quality of HIV services provided for inmates.
Discussion: The current study examines a range of process and outcome data relevant to the implementation of a
Change Team approach across diverse correctional settings in the United States. This initial study represents an
important step toward a national best practices approach to implementing change in U.S. correctional settings and
could serve as an exemplar for designing similar implementation studies.

Background
Prison inmates are at high risk for incident HIV infec-
tion and their prevalence of HIV is substantial, estimated
at 1.5% of all inmates in federal or state custody at the
end of 2010, making the need for proper surveillance
and care a paramount public health issue (Maruschak
2012). Although many correctional facilities offer HIV
testing and prevention services, including the provision
of antiretroviral therapy (ART), numerous studies have
demonstrated fundamental gaps in the delivery of effect-
ive HIV-focused care (Baillargeon et al. 2009; Beckwith
et al. 2010; Springer & Altice 2005). Fewer than half of
state prison systems offer opt-out testing (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention 2009), yet such testing
protocols are cost effective and can help identify inmates
with undetected infections (Begier et al. 2010). A num-
ber of barriers limit expansion of HIV testing among in-
mates, including stigma and discrimination (Earnshaw &
Chaudoir 2009), timing of the tests, and lack of linkage
with routine clinical exams (Kavasery et al. 2009).
Both primary and secondary interventions are important
for this population. Primary HIV prevention is directed at
all inmates, regardless of HIV status, and secondary HIV
prevention is tailored to individuals who have an HIV in-
fection. However, many inmates choose to not get tested
regularly, testing is not offered routinely throughout an in-
mate's incarceration term, HIV prevention interventions
may not be evidence-based or appropriate for specific
high-risk categories (e.g., injection drug users, women
who engage in risky sex, Spanish-speaking inmates, female
drug users), and primary and secondary prevention out-
comes are not routinely assessed following release from
prison (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009;
Hammett 2006). For inmates released to parole or under
other types of community supervision, HIV prevention is
not usually a priority, and access to HIV testing/counsel-
ing and prevention services is not routinely available
(Beckwith et al. 2010; Springer & Altice 2005).
Perhaps an even greater concern, inmates identified as
HIV-infected may be provided with ART by correctional
facilities because of constitutional mandates for provision
of inmate health care, but linkage to care following release
can be problematic. There are typically disruptions in
HIV-focused care once the inmate is released to the com-
munity. These disruptions may be caused by insufficient
supply of medications provided by the facility at release,
delays in obtaining Medicaid, and adherence problems by
released inmates (Baillargeon et al. 2009), which can have
serious health consequences for the HIV-infected inmate
and the community (Springer et al. 2011). Interruptions in
antiretroviral therapy can result in increased viral load or
reduced effectiveness of the medications, and thus a
heightened risk of HIV transmission (Deloria-Knoll et al.
2004; Mannheimer et al. 2002; Paterson et al. 2000).
Barriers also exist for initiating and adhering to ART
within correctional facilities, due to concerns about confi-
dentiality, stigma, and lack of information (Earnshaw, &
Chaudoir 2009; Roberson et al. 2009). Effective secondary
prevention programs for HIV-infected inmates are also
important for reducing the spread of infection to their sex-
ual and drug-using partners. It is also common for
community-based HIV service providers to encounter a
range of difficulties as basic as gaining access to institu-
tions to deliver services. For example, peer-based interven-
tions that incorporate former inmates as facilitators may
not be permitted in some correctional facilities. For both
HIV-negative and HIV-infected inmates, improvements in
pre-release planning/transitioning are needed. Because the
time immediately following release from prison to the
community is a particularly high-risk period, it is import-
ant to foster continuity of care approaches and secondary
HIV prevention services (Gough et al. 2010). Several strat-
egies for improving pre-release discharge planning have
been identified; effective linkages need to include engage-
ment in substance abuse or mental health treatment and
housing, in addition to HIV medical care (Baillargeon
et al. 2010a, 2010b; Rich et al. 2001; Springer et al. 2011;
Wolitski & Project START Writing Group 2006).
Improvements in the implementation and delivery of
HIV-related services in correctional facilities are urgently
needed to identify seropositive inmates, improve access to
and utilization of HIV testing services, enhance continuity
of prevention and medical care for inmates released to the
community, and expand access to evidence-based preven-
tion and ART for individuals under community supervi-
sion. Models of sexually transmitted disease transmission
dynamics (Beckwith et al. 2010; Jürgens et al. 2011) sug-
gest that reducing or preventing infections in core risk
groups, such as inmates, can greatly reduce transmission
of HIV throughout the community.
Theories of public health impact suggest that increas-
ing the receipt of HIV services into an at-risk population
would raise the overall positive public health impact,
even without significantly increasing the effectiveness of
the intervention--since public health impact is a product
of an intervention's effect size and the rate of utilization
of the intervention (Tucker & Roth 2006). Thus, inter-
ventions to increase HIV testing and detection of un-
identified infections, and increase continuity of ART, if
implemented on a large scale - such as across multiple
correctional systems ­ could be expected to convey tre-
mendous public health benefits. The complex chal-
lenges of improving the delivery of health services such
as HIV testing, prevention, and treatment within correc-
tional settings suggests that organizational or systems-
level interventions are needed to change practice and
increase the use of evidence-based practices (Taxman &
Belenko 2012).

The study described in this paper addresses three
major aims designed to test the effectiveness of a local
change team process improvement approach for: (1) im-
proving the perceived value of HIV services among staff
of correctional and community HIV organizations, (2)
increasing service penetration for inmates infected by or
at risk for HIV, and (3) improving the quality of HIV ser-
vice delivery (e.g., improved ART adherence) for high
risk or HIV-infected inmates. These aims are informed
by the Proctor et al. conceptual model of implementa-
tion research distinguishing between intervention strat-
egies, implementation strategies, and three levels of
outcomes, including implementation, service, and client
outcomes (Proctor et al. 2009). This implementation
model proposes that implementation strategies can tar-
get one or more of the five levels of the service delivery
environment, including individual providers, supervisory
practices, group learning, and organizational and sys-
tems environments. We examine the effectiveness of
implementation strategies at the organizational levels de-
scribed by this model. In this model, improvements in
client outcomes are viewed as dependent not only on
evidence-based practices and programs, including client
factors such as adherence to treatment, but also on
whether the innovation is an improvement to existing
practices. Service outcomes and by extension, client out-
comes, are viewed as dependent on the quality of the
implementation itself. The implementation model is
based on the assumption that successful implementation
will result in improved service outcomes which, in turn,
will lead to enhanced client outcomes. As such, two
types of outcomes are being assessed in the HIV-STIC
study: (1) Implementation outcomes and (2) Service-
level outcomes.
Three primary hypotheses are being tested:
Hypothesis 1: Value. Compared to the Control
condition, staff members from facilities in the
Experimental condition show greater improvements in
their ratings of the value of implementing HIV services.
Hypothesis 2: Services Penetration. Compared to the
Control condition, proportionately more inmates in the
Experimental condition who are at risk of or infected by
HIV receive services within the HIV services continuum.
Hypothesis 3: Quality of Service Delivery. Compared to
the Control condition, proportionately more inmates in
the Experimental condition who are infected by or at
risk for HIV receive improved services delivery within
the HIV services continuum.
Methods/Design
Study design
The HIV Services and Treatment Implementation in Cor-
rections (HIV-STIC) study evaluates the experimental
condition of using a modified Network for the Improve-
ment of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) model (McCarty
et al. 2007), which has been applied successfully in drug
abuse treatment facilities (Hoffman et al. 2008), to im-
prove HIV services in criminal justice settings, specifically
correctional (i.e., jail or prison) facilities. The NIATx
organizational change approach utilizes the program ad-
ministrator as the Executive Sponsor of a Local Change
Team (LCT) consisting of a Change Leader who has ac-
cess to the Executive Sponsor and members agreed upon
by the Change Leader. The NIATx approach focuses on
improving access to services and retention in treatment
(McCarty et al. 2007; Capoccia et al. 2007). It incorporates
five principles to identify problems and introduce and test
organizational changes: (1) understand and involve the
customer, (2) fix key, important problems, (3) pick a
powerful change leader, (4) get ideas from outside the
organization, and (5) use rapid cycle testing (McCarty
et al. 2009). Each of these principles is articulated, well-
defined, and reflected in structured activities that contrib-
ute toward identified organizational goals.
In the current study, a modified NIATx approach is
being compared to a conventional HIV staff training ap-
proach to improve the delivery of the continuum of HIV
services to jail or prison inmates. HIV services include
routine HIV testing, prevention/education program-
ming, and procedures to link HIV-infected individuals
to community-based treatment after confinement. A
non-blinded cluster randomized design is used with 14
pairs of correctional facilities randomized within nine
participating study sites in the US. Some of the study
sites have one pair of facilities in the study while other
sites have two pairs. The facilities are matched as pairs,
with the basic characteristics of each pair matched as
closely as possible to ensure an equivalent chance of
successful outcomes, based on size of inmate population
and custody/classification levels (e.g., minimum or
medium). One facility in the pair is randomly assigned
to the Control Condition while the other is assigned to
the Experimental Condition.
The quality improvement process tested in HIV-STIC
is modeled after the NIATx approach, but differs in im-
portant respects. Notably, the goal of the HIV-STIC is to
improve HIV testing and linkage to treatment, rather
than drug abuse treatment access and utilization. The
study also spans across organizations (correctional agen-
cies, community health and drug abuse treatment agen-
cies), which places greater emphasis on cross-agency
collaboration and coordination.
Study conditions
An initial face-to-face stakeholder orientation meeting
is designed to bring together criminal justice senior
management and the research center (RC) Principal

Investigator (PI)/researcher for an introduction to the
HIV-STIC study and overview of the study protocol in
each of the nine study sites. The RC PI designates an
Executive Sponsor for the study who is a senior agency
administrator. Across the nine study sites, Executive
Sponsors include state-level managers of correctional
health programs, medical services directors, and general
program directors. Topics for discussion at the orienta-
tion meeting include an overview of the HIV-STIC and
its goals, as well as details about study components , in-
cluding timeline, baseline training, randomization, staff
participation, consent process, and data collection. Based
on the discussions at this meeting, the Executive Spon-
sor selects one of the components of the HIV services
continuum ­ prevention/education, testing, or linkage to
treatment ­ on which to focus in the correctional agency
selected for the study. The Executive Sponsor also selects
Facility Sponsors (see Table 1) for each of the study
facilities. Additional study participants are then selected
by the Executive and Facility Sponsors based on their
involvement in delivering HIV services at the facilities;
these staff participate in baseline training prior to study
site randomization.
Baseline training
This training is designed to provide basic information and
resources relevant to the HIV services continuum as well
as evidence-based practices for implementing HIV services
to criminal justice populations. The content of this training
includes the HIV services continuum, HIV prevalence and
issues among inmates, and evidence-based HIV services in
institutional and community corrections. Staff attending
the training include the Executive Sponsor, the Facility
Sponsors, the facility medical directors, health care staff in-
volved with HIV testing, HIV counselors, qualified HIV in-
terventionists, prison/jail pharmacists, the drug treatment
coordinator, drug treatment staff, and corrections officer
supervisors, as well as participants from identified
community-based treatment and health organizations pro-
viding HIV-related care to newly released prisoners. One
joint training session involving staff of the two or four facil-
ities selected for the study is held for each of the study
sites. Thus, nine baseline trainings are conducted. Follow-
ing the training, informed consent is administered to the
staff participants and the baseline surveys administered.
The baseline training lasts about six hours and utilizes
adult learning principles which include connecting with
personal experiences, creating a safe learning environ-
ment, accommodating various learning styles, and pro-
viding active learning activities on HIV. The curriculum
focuses on knowledge acquisition (lecture, discussion,
review of printed materials) as well as skills training
achieved through such activities as role-playing exercises
involving realistic scenarios and practice sessions. The
training also includes a review of evidence-based HIV
prevention programs and information from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's Diffusion of Effect-
ive Behavioral Interventions project (Solomon et al.
2006); antiretroviral therapy and adherence; HIV testing
and counseling procedures and relevant policies, and
pre- and post-release planning models. Local policies
and issues relevant to the focus area at each Department
of Corrections (DOC) are incorporated and discussed in
training segments on implementation issues. The train-
ing is interactive and action-oriented, and is designed to
assist site staff to identify key agencies/staff positioned

Executive Sponsor An agency-level administrator who determines which area of the HIV services continuum will be the
primary focus for all facilities in their state or county. Monitors progress at all sites but is not involved
in day-to-day management of the implementation and change process.
Facility Sponsor In a position of senior authority at the prison or jail facility responsible for the overall change process.
Authorizes the staff time and resources at the prison or jail facility needed to complete the project and
participates with the Change Team Leader in selecting the change team members. Closely follows the
progress of the LCT; occasionally participates in team meetings; and meets frequently with Change Team
Leader. Selected by the Executive Sponsor.
Change Team Leader Interacts with the Facility Sponsor, keeping the Facility Sponsor informed of the change team progress,
requests the resources needed to accomplish the change team goal, works with the LCT Coach, tracking
the progress of the change team against the study timelines, calls meetings of the change team, and
assigns tasks and roles within the team. Selected by the Facility Sponsor.
Change Team Coach An external consultant trained in NIATx process improvement strategies. The Coach works with Change
Team Leader and agency representatives to help LCT identify roadblocks and other issues which may
impede effective implementation. The Coach spends one day training the change team and conducts
regular and in-person coaching sessions with the Change Team Leader and LCT. The Coaches from all
study sites participate in a collective monthly call with a mentor who is a senior member of the NIATx
core organization. Selected by the Researcher.
Local Change Team Consists of about 5­7 staff members from facility units affected by changes in HIV service delivery or
agencies related to or affected by any changes, including prison medical staff, program staff, counselors,
and community-based HIV service coordinators. The Team may also include an outside expert in the
field of HIV services.

to deliver improved HIV services. Following baseline
training, the matched pairs of study sites are randomized
into two study conditions. Randomization was con-
ducted by the chair of the CJDATS Steering Committee
using a SAS algorithm.
Control condition
In addition to the standardized baseline training for all
sites, participants at the control condition sites are pro-
vided web-based informational resources regarding a
range of relevant HIV-focused care services. An individual
who holds a management or supervisory position in the
facility is designated as a Facility Sponsor and selected by
correctional agency management to implement improve-
ment(s) to the HIV service delivery continuum at the con-
trol facilities. The leadership of those sites that focus on
linkage to care may include a representative from the tar-
geted community treatment agency. Management engages
additional staff at different stages of the study to work on
HIV services improvements (see Figure 1).
Experimental condition
Participants at the experimental condition sites are in-
volved in an approach to implementation that requires the
creation of local change teams (LCT) that work toward
identifying and accomplishing specific process improve-
ment goals with regard to HIV-focused care. Each LCT
consists of 5­7 permanent members, most of whom are
from the correctional agency (prison or jail; see Table 1)
or the agency's contracted on-site medical provider. Eli-
gible change team members have direct responsibility for
or direct involvement with the selected area of the HIV
services continuum and/or the specific evidence-based
practice being implemented at a site. Preference is given
to staff with responsibilities that affect the delivery of HIV
services who are recommended by correctional agency
management and who are expected to remain in their
current position for the duration of the study. For sites
that are focused on linking inmates to post-release HIV-
related care, a community-based HIV service provider is
also identified.
Experimental Condition participants engage in process
improvement strategies that involve a structured set of ac-
tivities collectively designed to produce organizational
change (McCarty et al. 2007). The assumption underlying
this approach is that creating change in organizational
operations requires a sustained multi-level effort that in-
volves leadership, ongoing staff involvement, understanding
Figure 1 Overview of HIV-STIC study design.

the organization's function from multiple viewpoints in-
cluding the "consumer" of services, systematic efforts to
test and measure new practices or interventions within the
organization, and thoughtful decision-making regarding
the results of the process improvement efforts. Initiation of
the modified NIATx process involves several distinct roles;
the primary participants are Executive Sponsor, Facility
Sponsor, Change Team Leader, and a Change Team Coach.
Short descriptions of these roles appear in Table 1.
The initial task of the LCT is to refine the problem ini-
tially identified by the Executive Sponsor and the Facility
Sponsor, and to reduce the problem into components that
can be individually addressed. Two procedures adapted
from NIATx are employed to gain a better understanding
of the problem and its component parts. A walk-through
is conducted in which two or more members of the LCT
go through the same process as the inmate regarding the
specific service under scrutiny. Confidential or anonymous
feedback is solicited from staff involved in the process
based on their observations and experience. The walk-
through and staff observations are then reviewed in order
to identify barriers within the system. The team then
chooses a single manageable component to be changed,
followed by additional components as each change is suc-
cessfully implemented, accepted, or revised. Examples of
process improvement goals that the LCT teams have iden-
tified include:
 Increase female attendance at HIV prevention
sessions;
 Increase percentage of inmates receiving HIV
prevention/education in 60-day period before
release;
 Increase percentage of inmates receiving HIV test at
admission;
 Increase HIV testing and;
 Improve linkage to community treatment for HIV +
inmates.
The implementation process involves rapid cycle testing
with teams following a Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA)
process. The frequency of team meetings is expected to
vary between study sites, but generally takes place bi-
weekly or monthly. Baseline data are collected for 6 weeks
prior to implementing the changes. These are not research
data, but rather data assembled by the LCT to inform its
work. The change is then implemented and data are col-
lected for a period of 3­6 weeks. Generally, data consist of
simple aggregates that can be shown on a single line graph
so as to make progress easy to interpret and demonstrate
to the agency staff. If the change is unsuccessful, another
change is substituted. If the change is successful, an add-
itional change is made to further improve the process. After
successful changes, the team formulates a sustainability
plan and responsibility for following up on the changes is
assigned to one of the change team members. In some
cases, a new sustainability team is formed along the same
principles as the original change team.
Participating sites
Six of the nine study sites implement the HIV-STIC study
in state prison facilities where inmates transition to the
community under parole supervision after release; how-
ever, three study sites implement HIV-STIC in jail facilities
where inmates have pending court cases or short sen-
tences. Study sites focusing on linking exiting inmates to
community-based HIV services identify at least one col-
laborating community-based program that provides HIV
services and medications to be involved in the study. To
the extent possible, the correctional and community-
based agencies involved in HIV-STIC are autonomous
such that introduction of the intervention in one agency
does not contaminate process improvements surrounding
HIV services in other agencies. Separate adult correctional
institutions are considered independent organizations if
they do not share a common central administrative entity
that is responsible for the establishment and promulgation
of agency policies and procedures regarding within-facility
delivery of HIV services. The facility is the potential target
of the organizational intervention.
Administrators of the correctional facilities selected for
the study and corresponding administrators of HIV com-
munity services organizations select staff to participate in
the HIV-STIC study, including staff responsible for pre-
vention, testing, and treatment activities. These staff mem-
bers vary as needed by site, but include HIV counselors,
prison medical staff, substance abuse treatment staff, and
community-based HIV services staff. Staff member partici-
pants are asked to complete surveys, participate in semi-
structured interviews, and adhere to study protocols. Add-
itionally, staff member participants in the experimental
condition serve as members of the LCT.
Data collection and measures
Primary and secondary outcomes for the study were se-
lected based on both the implementation research frame-
work suggested by Proctor and her colleagues (Proctor
et al. 2009) and the public health impact framework. The
primary sources of data for this study are staff surveys,
participating agency records of services, and anonymous
inmate surveys.
Primary outcomes
The three primary outcomes are value, services penetra-
tion, and services quality.
Value In this study, value is defined as a combination of
the acceptability, perceived feasibility, and perceived relative
Belenko et al. Health and Justice Page 6 of 11
2013, 1:8
http://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8
costs of implementing HIV service improvements as per-
ceived by staff members involved in the delivery of HIV ser-
vices in the study sites. One measure of value is a set of
items adapted from the Barriers to Research Utilization
Scale (Funk et al. 1991). This instrument contains subscales
for characteristics of the adopter, characteristics of the
organization, characteristics of the innovation, and charac-
teristics of the communication. Another measure, a modi-
fied version of the Usage Rating Profile-Intervention
(Chafouleas et al. 2009), focuses more specifically on the ac-
ceptability and perceived relative costs of implementing
enhancements of HIV services. This instrument contains
subscales for acceptability, knowledge, feasibility, and sys-
tems support. Feasibility is also measured using a modified
version of the Evidence Based Practice Attitudes Scale
(Aarons 2004), which includes subscales for requirements,
appeal, openness and divergence. All scales are taken from
previous studies and have good psychometric properties.
Services penetration Services penetration is defined as
the extent to which an evidence-based HIV service
reaches the appropriate target population. An example is
the proportion of inmates that receive HIV tests at ad-
mission. Because several study sites have very few staff
involved in HIV testing or linkage to treatment in the
community, penetration does not focus on staff mea-
sures, but rather focuses on the measure of penetration
as the proportion of inmates who receive an HIV service
such as HIV testing, prevention intervention, or linkage
of HIV-infected inmates to treatment in the community.
The services penetration measures are collected at the
aggregate inmate level.
Quality of service delivery Improvements in the quality
in which HIV services are delivered in correctional facil-
ities are related to the service-level outcomes of effi-
ciency, effectiveness, or timeliness of the service
delivery. Outcomes linked directly to these improve-
ments include time between assessment and HIV test-
ing, increases in the number agreeing to an HIV test,
increases in the number of inmates who receive ART,
and improved HIV treatment continuation rates.
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes are stigma, interagency collabor-
ation, and inmate awareness.
Stigma Stigma may be related to two implementation
outcome measures: (1) whether HIV service improve-
ments are perceived as having value and (2) the extent
of acceptance of HIV service improvements by correc-
tional staff. An adapted version of the HIV/AIDS Stigma
Scale (Zelaya et al. 2008) is given to staff in the study
sites. Embedded within the 21 items of this instrument
are 4 subscales reflecting fear of transmission and dis-
ease, association with shame, blame and judgment, per-
sonal support of discriminatory actions or policies, and
perceived community support of discriminatory actions
or policies.
Interagency collaboration Cooperation and coordination
are described as key determinants of process improve-
ment interventions targeted at the group or team level
(Proctor et al. 2009). Thus, interagency coordination and
collaboration are expected to be key factors determining
implementation outcomes at the organizational and sys-
tems (defined as cross-organizational) levels. Improve-
ments in HIV services, especially as inmates transition
to the community, are expected to result in experi-
mental site increases in interagency contacts, commu-
nication, program development, cross-agency training,
client service activities, and changes in collaborative
policies. These changes are expected to occur as part
of changes in program/service delivery processes that
are implemented as a part of the LCT intervention.
Interagency collaboration is being measured with a
modified version of the Interagency Collaborative Ac-
tivities Scale (Dedrick & Greenbaum 2011) and semi-
structured interviews with facility site administrators
and key service staff.
Inmate awareness Although the study's main focus is
the organizational system, a process improvement pro-
ject designed to focus on the delivery of HIV services
ought to impact the individuals receiving those services.
As such, an additional outcome is the perceived value of
services based on the perceptions of the inmates them-
selves. An anonymous survey of inmates at the study
sites includes questions about each of the areas of the
HIV services continuum (education and prevention, test-
ing, treatment), as well as pre-release planning.
Data sources
Staff surveys are used to capture data related to value,
stigma and interagency collaboration, as well as measure
staff perceptions of the characteristics of the organization,
and are completed prior to the baseline training and
10 months after the experimental site kick-off meeting.
Thus, the Barriers to Research Utilization, EBPAS, HIV
Stigma and Interagency Collaboration scales are completed
at baseline, prior to training. The modified Usage Rating
Profile-Intervention and the TCU-Workshop Evaluation
Form (Bartholomew et al. 2007) are completed immedi-
ately after the baseline training. Ten to fifteen staff mem-
bers at both Experimental and Control sites are selected to
receive the surveys, including nurses, correctional officers,
substance abuse treatment counselors, deputy wardens,
case managers, pre-release discharge counselors, nursing

administrators, and community HIV staff such as nurses
and administrators. At the end of the study, staff members
also complete a short survey designed to assess the impact
of the change team process on the facility, including staff
acceptance of the change process and whether sufficient
training resources exist to support modifications initiated
by the change team. Finally, members of the change team
in the Experimental sites complete a short survey on the
impact of the change team process.
Participating agency records are used to collect ser-
vices penetration and quality of service delivery data re-
lated to the process improvement measures for HIV
prevention/education, testing, and treatment. These data
are collected at monthly intervals beginning with the ini-
tiation of the intervention at the kick-off meeting and
concluding two months after the Experimental interven-
tion ends for a total of 12 months. The nine primary
HIV service penetration and quality of service items that
are used in the analysis are presented in Table 2.
The anonymous survey of inmates is administered in
both Experimental and Control sites as a means of asses-
sing awareness of and attitudes toward the HIV services
continuum among the general inmate population at each
study site. It provides a secondary measure of penetra-
tion and value--from the perspective of the inmate--of
the HIV service (prevention/education, testing, and/or
treatment) that is the focus of the study site. Prior to the
start of the study and at the end of the final data collec-
tion phase, at each facility, the research team administers
the survey to a convenience sample of a minimum of 50
inmates per facility. Data are anonymous and are not
collected longitudinally.
In addition to the quantitative data collection, qualita-
tive data are collected in both Experimental and Control
sites in the form of in-depth interviews with selected
staff who are involved in the intervention and one focus
group with the eight coaches assigned to the change
teams (one coach is working with two study sites). The
qualitative data provide additional contextual informa-
tion to complement the quantitative data collected. In
effect, the qualitative data help to explain why certain
quantitative outcomes emerge in the patterns observed.
In order to accomplish this, several themes are devel-
oped from each of the primary and secondary hypoth-
eses. For example, the theme `perceived importance of
service improvement' emerges from primary hypothesis
1 (Value). Specific interview questions are constructed
from each theme that, in turn, map onto the hypothesis.
For example, the following is asked of the LCT members:
"In your opinion, how important are the goal(s) that the
Change Team decided to address? Tell me some more
about that please. Do you feel that other goals should also
be addressed?" These questions and others in the inter-
view guide ask for staff views about the perceived import-
ance of service improvement related to HIV services and
thus provide detailed explanatory information regarding
hypothesis 1 (Value). The same process is done for each
primary and secondary hypothesis.
The focus group with the coaches provides additional
contextual information regarding their experience in
implementing a process improvement approach in cor-
rectional settings. The primary aims of the focus group
are to understand: 1) the challenges as a coach for
implementing a process improvement approach in cor-
rectional settings, and 2) the challenges as a coach for
implementing a process improvement approach as part
of a research project with an experimental design.
In order to monitor fidelity to the intervention and
gather information about site activities such as changes
in personnel, administration, or policies that may affect
the intervention, site research teams complete a quar-
terly assessment of fidelity in the Experimental sites and
a monthly site activity assessment in both Experimental
and Control sites. The monthly site activity data collec-
tion also captures changes in the local environment un-
related to the study that may affect study outcomes.
Finally, data are also collected to estimate the costs asso-
ciated with the intervention. The cost to an organization
of implementing a process improvement strategy is a po-
tential barrier for sustainability. Costs vary depending on
the particular HIV services goal at each site and particular
barriers faced in their systems. Because of the complexity
and variation across states and study sites in costs of HIV
medications and HIV tests, it is not feasible to do a full-
scale cost analysis. For example, because the costs of anti-
retroviral therapy differ, and prescriptions depend on
client- and state-specific guidelines and protocols, it would
be necessary to gain access to individual prescription data
and update these data if prescriptions change over time.
Such data collection efforts are not feasible for this study.
A benefit-cost analysis is also not possible because

individual client outcome data are not collected for this
study. Nonetheless, it is useful to collect some cost data
because intervention costs may affect the likelihood
of replication. Thus, study sites utilize a brief form to
collect data on the amount of time that staff members
spend on study-related activities. In addition, the costs of
HIV tests at each study site are collected to assess the
costs associated with any increased testing as a result of
the intervention.
Timeline
In this implementation study, we seek to test Hypotheses
1­3 that an organization-level intervention strategy can
improve the delivery of HIV services for preventing,
detecting, and treating HIV for offenders under correc-
tional supervision. The duration of the intervention
period is 10 months during which data are obtained
using a battery of survey instruments, and aggregate
services delivery data, as described above. Information
is collected at baseline using the baseline survey of
organizational characteristics (BSOC), HIV Staff Survey
(comprised of four scales), HIV Services Delivery (modi-
fied Usage Rating Profile-Intervention), Workshop
Evaluation Form (WEVAL), and Inmate survey. At the
10-month follow-up point the same instruments are
used as well as the Facility Impact Assessment, Change
Team Assessment, and qualitative interviews. The BSOC
and the WEVAL are only collected at baseline. Finally,
we collect information on a monthly basis ­ over a
12 month period ­ with regard to agency records, cost
data, and site activity. Thus, these data collectively allow
us to test Hypotheses 1­3 pertaining to the impact of an
organization-level intervention strategy. The data collec-
tion plan for the study is presented in Table 3. All sites
except one were in the field with the intervention by
early 2012, with one site initiating the protocol in sum-
mer 2012. Data collection will end in early 2013 and ini-
tial results are expected in late 2013.
Discussion
Although evidence-based practices for HIV services in
correctional settings have been identified, successfully
moving these practices into routine and efficacious
use in the field is an important challenge. Implementa-
tion research is needed to determine the optimal strat-
egies for achieving this goal (Rubenstein & Pugh 2006).
Improving implementation, and ultimately the sustain-
ability, of health services and evidence-based practices
requires careful attention to the systems, organizational,
and staff contexts within which these services are
delivered (Proctor et al. 2009). The multifaceted nature
of these contexts suggest that unless various staff
members embrace the need for and value of service
improvements, such improvements are not likely to be
well implemented or sustained.
Epidemiological models of sexually transmitted disease
transmission and public health models for improving
public health impact of interventions indicate that public
health impacts are maximized by detecting and reducing
infections within high-risk groups, and increasing the
utilization of prevention and treatment services (Tucker
& Roth 2006; Anderson 1991; Aral 2002; Blanchard
2002). Yet there has been little rigorous research on the
implementation of HIV services, or strategies for im-
proving implementation outcomes (especially staff per-
ceptions of the services) in correctional settings.
The high rate of HIV infection among incarcerated
persons calls for interventions that are effective in vari-
ous correctional settings in the US. The dual priorities
of health and security in correctional settings require
staff from different departments or organizations to
work across their usual domains in order to provide
adequate services. The HIV-STIC study is designed to
test whether a process improvement model based on the
utilization of Local Change Teams can significantly
improve services across the full continuum of HIV care,
including prevention, testing, and linkage to care upon
release. The study design described in this paper will
enable the research team to investigate a wide range
of process and outcome data relevant to the implemen-
tation of the Change Team model across diverse
correctional settings in the US. It is hoped that this
study will be an important step toward a national best
