A large and rapidly growing body of research indicates that
socioeconomic position is predictive of mortality and morbidity,
and declines in functional status at various ages in various
societies.1­24 The association has been found to be robust
across populations, methodologies, and measures. Yet, the
processes through which this association occurs are still not well
understood. This paper seeks to advance such understanding in
two ways: (1) by attending to the distinction between the
onset of health problems and their course or progression; (2) by
addressing whether and how education and income
differentially affect indicators of health.
Although it is well known that characteristics such as age,
gender, and socioeconomic status influence the probability of
having functional disorders, surprisingly little attention has
been paid to the degree to which these attributes relate to
functional problems as process. This is due in part to the relative
lack of panel data on representative population samples that
span sufficient years to allow for analyses of changes in cap-
acity. Further, although education and income are both valued
resources that are distributed differentially, and causally con-
nected over the life course, rather than just being indicators of
a single underlying dimension of `status', each is distinctive,
having unique causes and consequences as well as common
ones.

Education, income, and functional limitation
transitions among American adults:
contrasting onset and progression
Zachary Zimmer1 and James S House2
Accepted 27 May 2003
Background Although a robust association between socioeconomic status and health has been
shown in past research, the processes that explain the connection are not well
understood. This paper seeks to advance such understanding in two ways, first by
attending to the distinction between onset of a functional health problem and its
progression, and second by addressing whether and how education and income
relate differently to the onset versus progression of functional health problems.
Methods Data come from the Americans' Changing Lives survey (n = 3617). The baseline
was conducted in 1986 and outcome status measured in 1994. Activity limitations
are categorized into none, mild, moderate, severe. Onset is defined as having no
limitation at origin and a limitation at outcome. Progression is defined as limitation
of a particular severity at origin and improving, staying the same, or getting
worse with respect to the severity. Multinomial regressions determine transition
probabilities related to onset and progression.
Results Those with higher income and education are less likely to experience an onset.
Only income associates with progression. Those with the highest income are most
likely to improve and least likely to get worse in comparison to those with the
lowest income.
Conclusions Education, being determined early in life and influencing psychosocial mech-
anisms throughout life, may have a greater impact on prevention of activity and
functional disorders. Income's role may be both as a prevention factor and as a
mechanism for management of health problems.

We expect that education is more strongly predictive of onset,
while income is more predictive of course or progression. This
expectation begins from the recognition that most health prob-
lems of adulthood are chronic in both aetiology and course, and
are the outcome of a long process of development as a function
of exposure to a wide range of social, psychological, behavioural,
and biomedical risk factors.25 Education indexes both the socio-
economic position of individuals early in adulthood and a stock
of human capital available to them from that time on, both of
which influence long-term patterns of exposure to and experience
of major psychosocial and biomedical risk factors, including:
(1) preventive and therapeutic medical care; (2) deleterious
health behaviours such as smoking and lack of exercise;
(3) chronic and acute stress; (4) lack of social relationships and
supports; (5) exposure to physical hazards in home, neighbour-
hood, and work environment, such as pollution and dangerous
work conditions; and (6) psychological orientations or dis-
positions inimical to health such as anger/hostility or lack of
efficacy/control.26
In contrast, income, as usually measured in terms of the past
year, reflects socioeconomic position and resources closer to the
time of assessment of a health problem, thus being not only a
more proximate influence on the onset of a health problem but,
also a determinant of the course of that problem. That is, income
influences not only the exposure to or experience of aetiological
risk factors for health, but also, and probably more strongly than
education, the resources available for the treatment or man-
agement of disease or for modifying life circumstances to reduce
the factors (e.g. stress) producing or maintaining the disease.
Past studies have shown both shared influences and notable
differences in education and income influences on health.27,28
Non-US evidence suggests that education more strongly relates
to the existence of a functional health problem while income
more relates to the severity of the problem.29 Other research
has distinguished between prevention and management of a
health disorder,30 and shown education to differentially predict
incidence, recovery, severity, and mortality. Where onset and
progression have been examined, the focus has been on older
adults,31­33 and these studies showed that most sociodemo-
graphic characteristics influence both onset and progression, but
education influences onset only. These past studies are beginning
to suggest that the psychosocial and biomedical mechanisms
through which socioeconomic factors influence health could
differ depending upon the stage of disorder. Mediating factors
such as exercise and avoidance of risky behaviour may act upon
prevention, while the availability of medical and rehabilitative
programmes, which itself is differentially determined across
socioeconomic characteristics, may better relate to management
after an onset.
Prior prospective analyses on the US national sample
considered here have found that income is a stronger predictor
of mortality than education, while education has little effect on
mortality net of income.34 However, education is as strong or a
stronger predictor of changes in health.7 This research has failed
to carefully distinguish between the onset of health problems
among those free of such problems, and the course among those
with such pre-existing problems. In the present study, we focus
on how education and income differentially associate with
the probability that a functionally healthy person at one point
in time contracts a functional health problem over time, and
the probability that a person who has functional limitations
improves or gets worse over time. Specifically, using a sample of
American adults aged 25, we ask the question, is it the case
that education is more related to onset and income to progres-
sion of functional limitation?
Methods
Data
The study uses 1986 and 1994 waves of the Americans'
Changing Lives survey (ACL), a longitudinal probability sample
of 3617 non-institutionalized adults aged 25 living in the
contiguous US. Respondents were first interviewed in 1986,
and re-interviewed in 1989 and 1994. By 1994 there were
542 deaths, and 513 were lost to follow-up. Blacks and those
aged 60 were over-sampled, and weights are used to adjust for
this and non-response. More detail on the study can be found
in several other publications resulting from these data.7,34­36
Measures
Activity limitation is defined as an individual's reported belief
that their health hampers their ability to conduct basic daily
activities. The ACL study did not include a extensive battery of
Activities of Daily Living37 and Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living.38 It did include individual items on ability walking,
climbing stairs, and getting in/out of a chair, and also asked,
`(H)ow much are your daily activities limited in any way by
your health or health-related problems?' This study uses the
latter question, which may be thought of as a one-question
substitute for a battery of items. Responses allowed were not at
all, a little, some, quite a bit, and a great deal. A little and some
are combined into one category called mild activity limitation.
Quite a bit is considered as a moderate limitation and a great
deal is considered as severe level activity limitation.
Respondents initially reported education as years of formal
schooling. Although we tested for single years, and measured
discretely in various schemes, we found the most parsimonious
and useful coding to be a three-category measure, with categories
for less than high school, completed high school, and more than
high school education. It should be noted that other coding
schemes do not alter substantive findings. For income, a ques-
tion asked respondents to list combined self and spouse yearly
income from all sources before taxes. Those not responding
were led through income brackets. This allows those not
responding to the open-ended question to be categorized into
broad groups. The remaining refusals were given income levels
imputed on the basis of regression procedures including income
in other waves of the ACL as predictors. A four-category income
response variable is constructed (US$10 000; US$10 000­
19 999; US$20 000­39 999; US$40 000).
Multivariate models adjust for several covariates that are
important determinants of health outcomes. These are age, sex
(male or female) race (white, black and other), and marital status
(married and unmarried). All covariates are measured at base-
line. Table 1 provides the number of cases and per cent distribu-
tion for the originating and outcome status, and all explanatory
measures. For ease of presentation in this Table, age is cat-
egorized here into five categories, but is treated as a continuous
variable in multivariate models.

Conceptualization and modelling
The originating status is activity limitation measured in 1986
and the outcome status is measured in 1994. Onset refers to
having no limitation at origin and having a limitation of any
severity at outcome. Progression refers to the movement from a
particular severity of limitation at origin (mild, moderate, or
severe) to a particular status at outcome. Progression can refer
to staying the same as well as changing status. A transition
probability is the probability that an individual with a particular
limitation status at origin has a particular outcome status. The
sum of transition probabilities from any originating status is 1.0.
The aim of the analysis is to determine whether education and
income are associated with these activity limitation transition
probabilities.
It is understood that any one individual who reports no
limitations at origin and outcome may have experienced limita-
tions during the inter-survey period. It is also understood that
an individual who has a particular severity at origin may have
gone through several different transitions over the inter-survey
period. Although this is true, we can also assume that the
characteristics that relate to onset and progression will relate to
the chance of experiencing limitations or limitations of a par-
ticular severity at any point in time. For instance, if older adults
are more likely than are younger adults to have functional
limitations, then the probability that an individual who does not
have a limitation at origin will subsequently report a limitation
at outcome will be related to age. In this way, we assume
that onset and progression, defined by using two stationary
points in time, relates to onset and progression measures using
continuous time.
If onset and progression are a function of different sets of
determinants, then transitions need to consider two discrete
groups. Those reporting no limitation at origin are within the
first group. For this group, we monitor the probability of an
onset. The second consists of those who report limitations at
time of origin. For these individuals we determine probabilities
related to progression. We categorize progression as remaining
the same severity, improving, or getting worse.
We consider two additional transitions for each group. First,
we consider not surviving the inter-survey period. Second,
we consider not responding to the follow-up. About 13% of
the original sample were non-respondents at outcome and it is
possible that they have different education, income, and other
characteristics than those who do respond to the follow-up.
These additional two outcomes need to be considered in order
to assure that our models are not biased due to selectivity.
Although we are mostly interested in education and income,
onset and progression are also considered to be a function of
age, sex, marital status, and race. In addition, progression may
be a function of severity of limitations at time of origin. Grudy
and Glaser27 for instance, showed that improvement in status is
more likely for those with higher levels of severity. Survival
should also be related to severity of activity limitation at origin.
Since the outcomes for both onset and progression are non-
ordered categorical responses, we utilize multinomial logistic
regression equations procedures to estimate probabilities. The
model estimates a set of coefficients that correspond to each
possible outcome category. For example, given four outcomes,
the probability of outcome 1 is:
Pr (Y = 1) = (exp x(1))/(exp x(1) + exp x(2) +
exp x(3) + exp x(4))
where x represent a vector of coefficients and set of charac-
teristics. To identify this model, it is necessary to set one x = 0.
Thus, if x(1) = 0, the remaining coefficients measure the change
in probability relative to x(1). Setting a different contrast
category changes coefficients, but predicted probabilities for
groups remain the same. Unless the contrast category chosen is
the one of ultimate interest, it is often more intuitive to exam-
ine predicted probabilities with multinomial response categories
than coefficients estimated from the model. We examine both
coefficients and predicted probabilities.
Our models presented below include both education and
income. Analyses entering education and income separately
differ little from those shown below. All procedures were con-
ducted using the Stata Version 7.0 statistical software. Weight-
ing for multivariable procedures is conducted using sampling
or `probability' weights, as they are called in Stata, meaning that

Results
Originating and outcome status
Table 2 shows survival to be strongly dependent upon originating
status. The proportion not surviving the inter-survey period is
about 5% for those originating without any activity limitation,
16% for those with mild, 33% for those with moderate, and
44% for those with severe limitation. In contrast, non-response
varies only modestly and non-monotonically by originating
status, with a tendency for non-response to be highest among
those without limitations. This suggests that the selection in
terms of non-response is not substantially determined by
functioning.
For those who do survive, outcomes are dependent upon
originating status. About 58% of those without limitations at
time of origin are limitation free at outcome compared with 25%,
9%, and 7% of those with mild, moderate, and severe limitations.
There is also a fair amount of movement in and out of states of
limitation and around levels of severity. Complete recovery is
least likely for those originating with severe limitation and most
likely for those originating with mild limitation, but the chance
of some improvement is substantial for all.
Determinants of onset
Table 3 presents the model predicting transition probabilities for
the group originating without limitations (n = 2556). Results
presented are odds ratios (OR). Remaining without limitation
is the contrast and outcomes of onset, not surviving, and not
responding, are viewed relative to remaining without. OR of
greater than 1.00 indicate a higher probability of an onset, dying,
or not responding, while OR of less than 1.00 indicate a greater
probability of remaining without limitation. The 95% CI around
the OR are shown in parentheses.
Both education and income are significant determinants of
onset. Those completing high school or with more than high
school education are less likely to experience an onset, and the
same can be said for those with higher levels of income. Education
and income relate strongly to survival as well, with those with
high school or more education and those with higher levels of
income being less likely to die relative to remaining without
limitations. (Further analyses not shown here suggest small but
insignificant additional gains after high school and US$40 000.)
Those with higher education, and those with higher income, are

less likely to respond to the follow-up relative to remaining with-
out limitations. Associations with other covariates are generally
as would be expected. For instance, higher age is associated
with a greater probability of having an onset and not surviving.
Determinants of progression
Table 4 displays results for those originating with limitations.
Since these are individuals who have limitation, staying the
same is not necessarily a favourable outcome, although it is
more favourable than getting worse. Improvement of status is
the comparison. OR greater than 1.00 indicate a higher prob-
ability of remaining the same, getting worse, not surviving, or
not responding. Ratios less than 1.00 indicate a higher prob-
ability of improving. Those beginning with severe limitations
cannot get worse, and this coefficient is omitted (it is statistically
zero). Again, 95% CI are shown in parentheses.
The principal difference between this model and the previous
one is that education generally ceases to be predictive with the
only significant coefficient indicating, contrary to expectations,
that people in the highest educational category are more likely
to stay the same relative to improving. (We find this also in
models considering education without income, therefore the
result is not a function of shared variance.) In contrast, those in
the highest income category, when compared with the lowest
category, are less likely to stay the same relative to improve, and
less likely to get worse relative to improve. In other words,
those in the highest income category are more likely to improve
in status. Those in the highest two income brackets are less
likely to die relative to improving. The relationship between
education and survival is also not generally significant, though
any relationship that does exist is in the opposite direction
of expectations. As for the other covariates, it appears as if
only age continues to have a strong influence on transition
probabilities. Results also show strong associations with the
originating status. Those who originate with moderate or severe
activity limitations are more likely to improve than are those who
originate with mild limitations. For both Tables 3 and 4, inter-
actions between education and income on the one hand and
functional status at origin on the other were tested (results not
shown) but they did not significantly improve the models.
Predicted probabilities
Given that multinomial regression must, by definition, define a
contrast outcome, the direction and magnitude of relationships
that do not involve the contrast are difficult to determine just by
looking at the coefficients. Figure 1 presents a series of predicted
probability plots to clarify associations. The plots show transition
probabilities derived by using coefficients from the previous

models. Non-response is omitted as an outcome, so the sum of
probabilities is not 1.0. The probabilities hold other variables
constant such that they are averages for the sample.
Figure 1(a and b) shows probabilities associated with onset;
(a) shows these probabilities for the three categories of edu-
cation and (b) by the four income categories. Figure 1(a) shows
education to be strongly associated with onset of activity limita-
tion. The probability that someone without a limitation at time
of origin remains limitation free by outcome increases from
about 0.35 for those with without completed high school, to
about 0.45 for those completing high school, and then levels off
for those with more than high school education. At the same
time, the probability of having an onset decreases from about
0.32 to about 0.25. The probability of dying remains fairly flat.
The probability of remaining without limitations also increases
with increasing income. The chances of dying decrease with
increasing income from about 0.20 for those in the lowest income
category to about 0.08 for those in the highest.
Figure 1(c and d) shows probabilities associated with
progression. We examine probabilities only for those originating
with moderate limitations, so `improves' means having an out-
come of no or mild limitations and `gets worse' means having
an outcome of severe limitations. Associations between edu-
cation and progression are flat. For instance, the probability of
1094 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
Figure 1 Estimated probabilities of selected transitions by education and income
improving is about 0.50 regardless of level of education. The
probability of improving, however, increases substantially with
income from about 0.39 to about 0.66 between the lowest and
highest income levels. There is also a decrease in the probability
of not surviving by income.
Further tests
In order to further test the robustness of our findings, we
conducted other procedures and sensitivity tests. Already men-
tioned were tests for associations considering education and
income separately, tests for education measured continuously
and using various categorizations, and various interactions. We
noted some additional beneficial effect of education on onset at
the very upper levels, for instance, among those with 17 years
of formal schooling, although the additional benefit is generally
not significant. We also examined various measures of func-
tional status using different survey items, and results did not
differ substantially from those reported here.
Since most `events', for instance deaths, will occur to those
at older ages, we examined equations that stratified by age and
interactions of socioeconomic status by age. Also, because of
potential differences in effects across gender, we examined our
results for men and women separately. At times these results
are not very meaningful because of small cell sizes resulting
from dividing the sample further, particularly when examining
progression, since fewer originate with limitations. Nonetheless,
the results are worth reporting since they not only serve to
affix some additional perspective to the analyses but suggest
direction for further research. For the most part, results were
consistent across ages and sex. Interactions showed that income
effects were a little less important as age increased, which makes
some sense since current income should be a less distinguishing
indicator of status once people begin to retire. Education had
a somewhat greater influence on the chances of improving
status among those originating with limitations at younger ages.
Although this was not consistent across the transitions, it is a
reasonable finding if it is assumed that limitations at younger
ages tend to be more acute and subject to fluctuation rather
than the chronic types of limitations that are more characteristic
at older ages.
Finally, disadvantages inherent in separating the sample
into smaller sizes include making estimates less stable and not
allowing for determination of whether differences in effects are
statistically significant. We addressed this by pooling samples
and examining equations that predicted outcomes (no limita-
tions, mild, moderate, severe, did not survive, did not respond)
using interaction terms for education and income by originating
status. The results are consistent with those shown above. There
are significant interactions between education and originating
status. These interaction effects serve to lessen the effect of
education on outcome status for those who originate with lim-
itations. There are no significant interactions with income, suggest-
ing that income operates more consistently across originating
statuses.
Conclusion
In order to advance our understanding of the mechanisms
through which socioeconomic status factors relate to health,
the current study examined transition models for onset and
progression of functional limitation. Education was strongly
associated with onset, while income was found to have asso-
ciations with both onset and progression. We conclude that
education and income have varying effects and that onset and
progression are a function of different sets of predictors. This is
generally consistent with our expectations, suggesting the neces-
sity of attending increasingly to the different ways in which
socioeconomic variables relate to health outcomes. Education,
which is largely completed and fixed by early adulthood, exerts
a pervasive effect on trajectories of experience in early and
middle adulthood, has strong effects on the onset of functional
health problems (or the avoidance thereof), but little or no
effect on the progression of such problems among those who
already manifest them at baseline. Income affects the onset of
functional health problems, and equally affects the course of
such problems, especially the chances of improvement and
avoidance of further decline.
We also saw that mortality is differentially influenced by edu-
cation and income. Both appear to improve survival chances
among those who originate healthy. Education has less influ-
ence among those who originate with limitations. This finding
is in contrast to earlier studies that do not examine survival
separately among those originating in different states of health.
It may be that those with higher education are better able to
ward off health disorders that threaten survival. But, when
problems do arise to those with high levels of education, they
may be of equal or greater seriousness in comparison to the health
problems that arise for those with lower levels of education.
Some of the current findings are consistent with the results
of other recent studies, some of which also use the ACL data.
Lantz et al.34 find that income is better able to predict mortality,
which is normally the outcome of the progression of disease. In
contrast, Lantz et al.7 find that education is as or more predictive
than income of changes in functional self-rated health, these
changes reflecting not only the course of existing health prob-
lems but also the onset of new problems, with the present study
isolating this onset. Education is more predictive of risky health
behaviours which contribute to onset of health problems with a
long latency (i.e. smoking, drinking, and eating patterns), while
income is more predictive of a health behaviour (physical
exercise) with more immediate effects on health, even among
those with disease.34 Examining physical functioning among
older adults, Zimmer et al.24 in Taiwan, and Grundy and Glaser33
in Britain, find education to be predictive of the incidence or
onset of a functional problem among those beginning an obser-
vation period in a healthy state, but not predictive of changes in
function among those originating with problems. Together, these
studies are beginning to suggest the need to separate out socio-
economic influences according to specific stages of the disease
and disability to further understand the processes involved.
There are limitations to the current study. First, loss to
follow-up tends to be a problem in most panel research. To the
extent that the predictors operate the same way in the non-
respondent group as in the respondent group, modelling the
loss to follow-up as a transition adjusted for some of this in the
current analysis. Those lost to follow-up tend to have higher
levels of education and income than respondents, and they are
more likely white and married (Tables 3 and 4). Individuals
with these types of characteristics tend to be in the function-
ally healthier group. If their transitions follow the patterns

found, then participation of those that were lost would have
strengthened significance of associations. However, there is also
the possibility that those lost are a unique group. Since we
cannot be certain about their health transitions, loss to follow-
up remains a limitation.
Second, our outcome measure of functional limitation is
somewhat limited, being based on responses from a single item.
The ACL questionnaire included other functional items, like
ability walking, climbing stairs, and getting out of a chair. We
examined these individually and together as an index, and
the results do not vary substantially from those reported herein.
Other analyses of this data show that the single item measure
we used behaves similarly to other indices of self-assessed and
chronic health conditions7,35 However, it would be informative
if the current methodology were expanded to analyses of the
onset and progression of other types of health problems, includ-
ing clinical measures of health.
Third, the number of cases does not allow us to confidently
stratify to assess whether associations are similar across age and
sex groups. This is particularly true for the group that originates
with limitations. However, as noted above, initial indications
are that there may be at least some moderate differences in
effects for the younger versus older groups, while the effects of
income may be stronger for men than for women. We suggest
future study would do well to examine interactions more
carefully.
Despite these limitations, the results have implications for
our understanding of functional health and socioeconomic
disparities therein, and for the potential application of such
understanding. Education is an early life experience, but has
implications for later life health. We interpret our results to
suggest that education is associated with the prevention of func-
tional health disorder. This works through better understanding
of the nature of disease and how to avoid illness, for instance, a
history of not smoking, healthy diet, and other factors that have
long-term impact on prevention. Hence, those with higher edu-
cation will witness a delay or compression of morbidity. Income
is also important with respect to prevention, likely for similar
reasons, but income is even more important in terms of facil-
itating improvement and recovery from problems once they
arise. We suggest that this may be a function of the greater
ability to treat and manage disease among those with higher
income. Higher current income, for instance, may allow indi-
viduals to purchase quality health care and other amenities that
can assist in recovery. A reverse causal connection with income
is also possible since those who become ill are more likely to
reduce their employment as a result, leading to declining
income. Yet, the current study did examine effects of baseline
income on changes in health over time, enhancing the confid-
ence of the causal connection. Further research that uncovers
the distinct pathways through which education and income
influence the onset and progression of health disorders would
assist in further elucidating the distinct processes involved.
