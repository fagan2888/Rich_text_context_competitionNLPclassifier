Objective: To examine the impact of early educational
experience at age 8 years on child growth status. The In-
fant Health and Development Program has shown posi-
tive impacts to age 8 years on intelligence and adaptive
functioning of larger preterm infants.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Home and center based.
Participants: Three hundred seventy-seven interven-
tion (INT) and 608 nonintervention (NI) children, strati-
fied by birth-weight categories 2001 to 2500 g and 2000 g
or less.
Intervention: Educational intervention from nursery
discharge until age 3 years.
Main Outcome Measures: Eight-year weight, height,
head circumference, and body mass index.
Results: Complete data were available for 313 INT chil-
dren and 491 NI children. Adjusting for child birth weight,
birth-weight category, treatment groupbirth-weight cat-
egoryinteraction,sex,race,andNeonatalHealthIndex;ma-
ternal education and preconception weight; and site, the
INT children at age 8 years were significantly taller (127.6
vs 126.6 cm; P=.02) and had a larger head circumference
(52.5vs52.1cm;P.001)thantheNIchildren.Thepreva-
lenceofbothoverweight(9%)andunderweight(4.5%)was
the same in both treatment groups. Lighter low-birth-
weightINTchildrenhadgreater8-yearweight(28.0vs26.8
kg; P=.02), larger head circumference (52.6 vs 52.1 cm;
P.001), and larger height (127.6 vs 126.5 cm; P=.05)
compared with their counterparts in the NI group.
Conclusion: Low-birth-weight preterm children, spe-
cifically the lighter low-birth-weight group, who re-
ceived the Infant Health and Development Program edu-
cational intervention were heavier and taller and had
greater head circumference compared with NI children
in the same birth-weight category.

LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT PRETERM
(LBWPT) infants are likely to
demonstrate smaller size,
more health problems, lower
cognitive skills and aca-
demic achievement, and more behavioral
problems at school age when compared
with term normal-birth-weight peers.1-7 In
a recent meta-analysis of studies that com-
pared term infants with preterm infants
at school age, term children had signifi-
cantly higher cognitive scores.8 Although
most LBWPT infants become normal size
for age by school years, low-birth-weight
(LBW) (particularly extremely LBW) chil-
dren at school age are more likely to be
shorter and lighter than children of nor-
mal birth weight.6,7,9,10 In sum, LBWPT in-
fants are more likely to demonstrate defi-
cits in both growth and development
throughoutinfancyandchildhood.Abroad
array of prenatal and perinatal clinical fea-
tures, along with a range of perinatal and
postnatal clinical characteristics, may con-
tribute to these relative deficits.11,12 In ad-
dition, various sociodemographic and so-
cioenvironmentalcharacteristicsoffamilies
have been shown to have significant long-
term effects on the array of outcomes of
LBWPT children.13-15
Multiple experimental educational in-
tervention programs for infants and tod-
dlers have been implemented and as-
sessed.16-23 Theseprogramscommonlyfocus
attention on preschool children at in-
creased risk because of their environmen-
talcircumstances.Mostsuchprogramspro-
vide educational stimulation for these
children while working with parents, and
their primary outcome of interest has been
improved developmental/cognitive status.
Thefavorableeffectsoftheseprogramshave
been demonstrated into school years,16-18
adolescence, and young adult years.19-21

Other interventions have focused on infants and toddlers
who are at risk because of their biological status, such as
LBWPT infants.18 The largest such comprehensive pro-
gram that targeted LBWPT infants, the Infant Health and
Development Program (IHDP), consisted of a multifac-
eted intervention that began at discharge from the nursery
and continued until age 3 years. The children in the IHDP
intervention (INT) group had significantly higher cogni-
tiveandbehavioralstatusandsomewhathigherminormor-
bidity when compared with a nonintervention (NI) group
atage3years.24 Therewerenodifferencesinlengthorbody

children.Byage8years,infantswhowereintheINTgroup
and had a birth weight of 2000 g or less were not different
from children of the same birth weight in the NI group in
cognitivestatusoracademicachievement.Thepretermin-
fants in the INT group with a birth weight of 2001 to 2500
g, compared with the infants who did not receive the in-
tervention, showed significantly higher full-scale IQ and
mathematic achievement scores.25 These differences per-
sisted in the recently completed 18-year follow-up.26
These early developmental intervention programs fo-
cused little attention on growth status or growth rate as an
outcome measure. Although many early intervention pro-
grams provided nutritional education to families and of-
fered snacks and meals at their centers, we are aware of no
such early intervention program that evaluated growth as
an outcome measure. Since growth status and growth rates
are considered important markers of a child's well-being,
particularly for LBWPT children who are at increased risk
for long-term health, growth, and developmental prob-
lems, we evaluated the effects of the multifaceted IHDP in-
fant intervention on longer-term growth status. The IHDP
intervention offered a unique opportunity to evaluate the
impact on long-term growth because this cohort was fol-
lowed up in a standardized study protocol longitudinally
untilage8years,andabroadarrayofhigh-qualitydatawere
carefully collected, which allowed us to control for many
important confounding variables. We examined the fol-
lowing research questions: Does the growth status of
LBWPT children who received the multifaceted IHDP in-
terventiondifferfromtheNIgroupin8-yearweight,length,
head circumference, and BMI, while controlling for im-
portant child clinical and parent variables? Do these 8-year
effects vary based on birth-weight category?
METHODS
Detailed descriptions of IHDP recruitment and subjects, study
design, and intervention have been published in detail else-
where and are reviewed briefly herein.24,25,27 All participating
IHDP universities received required institutional review board
approval at all data collection points. The University of Arkan-
sas for Medical Sciences institutional review board approved
the analyses described herein.
SAMPLE
Infants were eligible for the IHDP study if they had a birth weight
of 2500 g or less, had a gestational age of 37 weeks or less, re-
sided in the catchment area, and did not have severe medical ill-
ness or neurological impairment. Unhealthy infants were in-
cluded unless they had conditions (eg, neural tube defects, severe
sensory deficits) or neurological dysfunction that were recog-
nized before nursery discharge and were judged to be so severe
as to preclude participation in the intervention. Only 61 such
infants were excluded. The infants were enrolled from October
1984 through August 1985. A total of 985 infants constituted
the primary analysis group. These infants were randomly as-
signed to the INT group (n=377) or the NI group (n=608) at
discharge from the nursery using a design with 2 birth-weight
strata:lighterLBW(LLBW)(2000g[n=623])andheavierLBW
(HLBW) (2001-2500 g [n=362]). All children assigned to the
INTgroup,regardlessoftheircompliancewithintervention,were
included in the analyses as INT children.
DATA COLLECTION
Infants in both INT and NI groups received the same periodic
medical, developmental, and social assessments through 8 years
of age. Clinical staff at each site typically included a pediatri-
cian and a nurse clinician and social worker. All measure-
ments were collected by standardized protocol after careful train-
ing. All children were assessed at 40 weeks' postconceptual age
and at 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months' gestation-corrected
age and at 4, 5, 6.5, and 8 years of age.
INTERVENTION
The intervention program began at discharge from the neonatal
nursery and continued until October 1988, when each child was
at least 36 months of age, corrected for degree of prematurity.
The intervention consisted of home visits (birth to age 3 years),
attendance at a center for education intervention (age 1-3 years),
and parent group meetings (age 1-3 years).24 Children were eli-
gible to attend the child development center 5 days per week for
approximately 6 hours per day for 2 years. Children received 2
meals per day. There was no nutrition focus in the IHDP and no
nutrition data were collected. Clinicians provided general care
instructions during all follow-up clinic visits to INT and NI chil-
dren, including nutrition advice as needed. After the interven-
tion ended, the sites attempted to find appropriate community
education programs for children in both INT and NI groups.
Within sites, there were no differences between the INT and NI
groups in maternal reports of child enrollment in education pro-
grams at age 4 years.
8-YEAR SAMPLE AND DATA
Of the original 985 in the primary analysis group, 878 chil-
dren (89%) were evaluated at 8 years of age. The percentage of
children retained within the INT and NI groups was similar,
both overall and within sites25; 89.7% of the INT group and
88.8% of the NI group were available and 90.5% of the LLBW
and 86.7% of HLBW were available at 8 years. Eight-year growth
status was assessed by clinic staff who had access to the child's
treatment group assignment and history. All growth measures
were collected by standard protocol after appropriate training
procedures.
The following measures were used for the clinical analy-
ses: weight; height; head circumference; and BMI (calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).
ANALYSES
Baseline demographic characteristics (based on a sample of 878
subjects who participated in the 8-year data collection) were
compared using either t tests for continuous variables or 2 tests
for categorical variables.

For the 8-year analysis, complete data on all control vari-
ables and 8-year growth measures (weight, height, BMI, BMI
percentile, and head circumference) were available for 314 INT
children and 491 NI children. Comparative analyses of all 8-year
growth variables were performed between INT and NI groups
for the full sample and within the 2 birth-weight categories.
Linear mixed models were used to compare the 8-year growth
measures means between the INT and NI children, adjusting
for covariates. Predictors included a site effect (only random
effect), treatment group (INT or NI), child birth weight, child
birth-weight category (2000 g or 2000 g), treatment group
by birth-weight category interaction, sex, race (white/other,
black, or Hispanic), maternal education at time of entry into
the study (high school, high school, or high school), pre-
conception weight of the mother, and Neonatal Health Index.
The Neonatal Health Index is a marker of severity of neonatal
course calculated based on length of stay in the neonatal nurs-
ery, adjusted for birth weight and standardized to a mean of
100, with higher scores indicating better health. The models
were fit using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Inc, Cary, North
Carolina). Individual model effects were evaluated for statis-
tical significance using the Type III F statistics. Although a treat-
ment groupbirth-weight category was postulated, the inter-
actions did not reach statistical significance for any of the
measures. Post hoc least squares means comparisons based on
t tests were used to compare treatment group differences by
birth-weight category.
To examine the growth of all growth variables over time be-
tween the INT and NI children, linear mixed models were used
to model the heights, weights, and head circumferences at 24,
36, 48, 60, 78, and 96 months of age, controlling for the same
variables noted earlier. Fixed effects were evaluated using Type
III F tests. Post hoc least squares means comparisons based on
t tests were used to compare treatment group differences for
each period. All available data were used at each period.
To allow comparison of the growth status of the IHDP par-
ticipants with the general population of the same age, z scores
were calculated for weight, height, and BMI by using age- and
sex-specific national values based on 2000 Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention growth charts. (http://www.cdc.gov
/GrowthCharts/).CentersforDiseaseControlandPreventionstan-
dards are not available to calculate head circumference z scores
for ages beyond 36 months. All calculations were done using SAS
9.2 software or Stata 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Baseline demographic characteristics of the 878 subjects
who participated in the 8-year data collection are shown
within birth-weight categories by intervention group sta-
tus (Table 1). Birth weight, length, and head circum-
ference did not vary between INT and NI groups within
either birth-weight category. The mothers of the NI group
weighed on average more than 6 lb more (P=.02) than
the INT group in the LLBW sample. There were no other
significant differences between the baseline variables by
intervention group within birth-weight categories. We
compared these baseline variables between the full origi-
nal sample and those who completed the 8-year evalu-
ation (data not shown). There were no differences in any
of these baseline variables, except the mothers of the chil-
drenwhocompletedtheeighth-yearevaluationweremore

in Table 2 by intervention group after adjusting for the
many baseline variables. The children in the INT group
were significantly longer (by 1.0 cm; P=.02) and had sig-
nificantlylargerheadcircumference(by0.4cm;P.001).
The children in the INT group on average weighed 700
g greater than the NI group but this did not reach sta-
tistical significance. There was no difference between the
groups in 8-year BMI. The percentage of children with a
BMI greater than 95% or less than 5% did not differ be-
tween INT and NI groups.
Eight-year growth status is shown in Table 3 by in-
tervention group category within birth-weight catego-
ries. Within the LLBW sample, the 8-year weight was sig-
nificantly heavier for the INT group (by 1.2 kg; P=.02),
height was 1.1 cm longer (P=.05), and head circumfer-
ence was significantly larger (by 0.5 cm; P.001). While
all 8-year anthropometric variables were larger for the
HLBW infants in the INT group, none of these differ-
ences between treatment groups reached statistical sig-
nificance.TherewerenodifferencesinBMIforeitherbirth-
weight category. There were no significant differences in
either birth-weight category between NI and INT chil-
dren with either a BMI greater than 95% or less than 5%.
z Scores for weight, length, and BMI were calculated
for both treatment groups for the full sample and the 2
birth-weight categories (Table 4). For the full sample,
8-year z scores for weight (mean [SD], INT, 0.2 [0.08];
NI, 0.04 [0.06]; P=.04) and height (mean [SD], INT, -0.09
[0.07]; NI, -0.26 [0.06]; P=.03) were significantly higher
for the INT group. Body mass index z scores did not dif-
fer significantly between the groups. For the LLBW group,
8-year z scores for weight (mean [SD], INT, 0.18 [0.09];
NI, -0.05 [0.08]; P=.02) and height (mean [SD], INT,
-0.10 [0.09]; NI, -0.28 [0.08]; P=.05) were signifi-
cantly higher for the INT group. Body mass index z scores
did not differ significantly between the LLBW groups.
There were no significant differences between HLBW
treatment groups in BMI, weight, or height z scores. These
z scores are depicted graphically in Figure 1.
The evolution of weight, height, and head circumfer-
ence for the LLBW preterm infants between the INT and
NI infants from 24 months to 8 years is shown in
Figures 2, 3, and 4. The differences in weight between
the INT and NI LLBW groups became statistically sig-
nificant by age 48 months and persisted until age 8 years.
The difference in height for the INT and NI LLBW in-
fants became significant at age 78 months and persisted
to age 8 years. The difference in head circumference was
statistically significant at age 36 months, and these dif-
ferences persisted and increased until age 8 years.
COMMENT
Low-birth-weight preterm children who were assigned to
the IHDP intervention to age 3 years were taller and had
larger head circumference at age 8 years compared with
children who did not receive the intervention. The greater
impact on growth was seen in the smaller LLBW group
with a birth weight of 2000 g or less as compared with the
group with a birth weight of 2001 to 2500 g. In this group,

were1.1cmtaller,andhadlargerheadsizeby0.5cm.These
differences were noted before age 8 years. The weight was
significantly larger for the LLBW INT group infants by age
4 years and persisted until age 8 years. The head circum-
ference was significantly larger by age 3 years in this group
and this difference persisted until age 8 years. There was
no difference in BMI, or the percentage of children with a
BMI greater than 95% or less than 5%, between NI and
INT groups for the full sample or the LLBW or HLBW
groups. These analyses controlled for site, birth size, neo-
natal course, and maternal size and demographic vari-
ables. There were no differences between the INT and NI
groups within birth-weight categories in baseline birth
weight,birthheadsize,orbirthlength,theNeonatalHealth
Index, and most maternal growth variables. In fact, the
mothers of the NI infants in the LLBW group weighed on
averagemorethan6lbmorethantheINTmothers(P=.02).
Are these differences in growth patterns resulting from
the IHDP intervention of clinical significance? Greater
growth attainment in term infants has been shown to be
associated with higher cognitive abilities.28,29 Larger head
circumference is associated with higher intelligence,30,31
and taller children and adults have higher IQ, academic
achievement, and, ultimately, job attainment and in-
come.32-34 While all LBWPT children are at greater risk to

who demonstrate atypical growth in weight and head cir-
cumference, particularly in the early years of life.38,39 In
addition,earlypoorheadcircumferencegrowth,afterwhich
slow compensatory growth occurs, is associated with later

dren with later cognitive impairment have been shown to
have smaller head circumference at ages 4 and 15 years,
even after adjusting for growth restriction and socioeco-

sible to speculate that the improvements in growth that
resulted from the IHDP intervention may have some long-
term benefits in the development of these children, al-
though no benefits were noted at age 8 years on cognitive
skills or academic achievement in the LLBW infants who
received this intervention.
We are aware of no early intervention programs that
focused on children at biological or social risk in this coun-

veloping countries that have provided nutritional supple-
mentation and psychosocial stimulation to mothers and
children with malnutrition or who were at risk for mal-
nutrition. In a study of malnourished children identified
between the ages of 9 and 24 months in Jamaica, a 2-year
intervention was implemented, including both nutri-
tionalsupplementationandpsychosocialstimulation.There
were no benefits on height, weight, or head circumfer-

A group of Colombian children judged to be at risk for
malnutrition because of poverty received food supple-
mentation and home visitation from birth until age 3 years.
At age 3 years, the children were significantly taller and
heavier. Positive effects on weight and height persisted to
age 6 years, 3 years after the interventions were discon-
tinued.Theauthorsconcludedthatbothmorepositivefam-
ily functioning and biological mechanisms accounted for
these benefits.46
One can only speculate regarding the mechanism that
resulted in the positive effects of the IHDP intervention
on the growth of these LBWPT infants. Children in the
IHDP intervention were provided 2 meals per day for 2
years. Perhaps this longer-term growth effect is a direct
result of the food provided at these meals. This is not likely
the complete explanation, as the IHDP sample consisted
of families of a broad array of socioeconomic back-
grounds, not just impoverished children, and they were
in general likely to provide adequate diets to their chil-
dren. There were no differences in the incidence of fail-
ure to thrive noted between the IHDP INT and NI groups,
as noted in a previous publication.27 It is also possible that
the positive effects on growth were a reflection of im-
proved parenting. The IHDP intervention has been shown
to improve the quality of mother-child interaction and the
children's home environment in the first 3 years of life.47,48
Perhaps the children came to learn mealtimes to be both
a biological event in which they received nutrition and a
social event for mutual exchange between adults and chil-
dren. This could lead to increased nutrition and nur-
turance over the years, which could ultimately improve
growth status. Another pathway that might have resulted
from the IHDP intervention is the reduction of stress for
both parent and child. There is evidence that excessive
stress during infancy, including prolonged stays in neo-
natalintensivecareunitsinearlychildhood,mayhavenega-
tiveconsequencesongrowthvianeuroendocrinestresssys-
tem response.49 Perhaps the benefits of the intervention
on the child and parent together minimized the neuroen-
docrine effect of stress on these preterm infants. This lat-
ter speculation may also partially explain why the greater
effects on growth were noted in the lighter LBWPT in-
fants who were more likely to have had prolonged stays
in the neonatal intensive care units. An alternative expla-
nation, of course, is that these results may not be the con-
sequence of the IHDP intervention, but rather due to some
variable not measured by the IHDP protocol.
There is substantial evidence that adverse circum-
stances, such as being born at a low birth weight and pre-
mature or poor parenting practices, can have negative im-
pacts in nearly every domain of development. As negative
consequences accumulate in one domain of develop-
ment, they are likely to compromise development in other
domains as well; that is, there is interconnectedness in
adaptive functioning across domains. Broad-based inter-
ventions, such as the IHDP intervention, aimed at stem-
ming the negative consequences of LBW and its cofac-
tors are likely to produce a variety of positive outcomes
for children even when the primary goal of the interven-
tion may be to increase intellectual development and
school readiness. Although our study is limited because
direct measures of nutrition and maternal feeding prac-
tices are not available, the IHDP intervention, with its
broad focus of supporting both parents and children, ap-

pears to have benefited these premature LBWPT chil-
dren in a variety of ways, including growth.
In summary, LBWPT children who received the IHDP
intervention to age 3 years were taller and had larger head
circumference at age 8 years. The greater impact of this
intervention was seen in the LLBW children born at a
weight of 2000 g or less. The prevalence of overweight
status did not differ between treatment groups. These
results vary from the previously reported cognitive
outcomes since only the HLBW infants (birth weight
2001-2500 g) demonstrated positive beneficial effects on
cognitive scores at age 8 years. The mechanisms and long-
term significance of these results are not clear.
