Hospital Capital Investment During
the Great Recession
Sung Choi, PhD1*
Abstract
Hospital capital investment is important for acquiring and maintaining technology and equipment needed to provide health
care. Reduction in capital investment by a hospital has negative implications for patient outcomes. Most hospitals rely on debt
and internal cash flow to fund capital investment. The great recession may have made it difficult for hospitals to borrow, thus
reducing their capital investment. I investigated the impact of the great recession on capital investment made by California
hospitals. Modeling how hospital capital investment may have been liquidity constrained during the recession is a novel
contribution to the literature. I estimated the model with California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development
data and system generalized method of moments. Findings suggest that not-for-profit and public hospitals were liquidity
constrained during the recession. Comparing the changes in hospital capital investment between 2006 and 2009 showed that
hospitals used cash flow to increase capital investment by $2.45 million, other things equal.

Introduction
Capital investment by a firm is the acquisition and mainte-
nance of plant, property, and equipment needed for its
operations. Hospital capital investment is important for
purchasing technology and equipment necessary to serve
patient needs, such as beds, magnetic resonance imaging,
and health information technology. Cutbacks in capital
investment by a hospital have negative implications for
patient outcomes.
The great recession in the United States began in December
2007 and ended in June 2009.1 Not-for-profit hospitals, which
comprise about 58% of US community hospitals,2 rely on
debt in the form of bonds and bank loans as the main source
of capital to fund capital investment. Investor-owned hospi-
tals (21% of US community hospitals) have more flexibility
in financing capital investment because in addition to debt,
they can raise equity by selling stocks. In 2008, nearly half of
all non-federal hospitals had put capital projects, including
facilities, clinical technology, and information technology, on
hold or stopped projects in progress.3 Also, the recession
deteriorated the value of marketable securities held by hospi-
tals. Endowment loss due to the recession led hospitals to
delay purchase of health IT and cut unprofitable services.4 I
focused on California hospitals because their financial data
were readily available in detail through the California Office
of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). In
California, hospital capital investment per dollar of capital
decreased from 2008 to 2010, reversing the increasing trend
from 2003 to 2008 (Figure 1).
A firm is liquidity constrained when lenders limit
how much a firm can borrow to fund capital investment.

using internal cash as an alternative. The recession was a
powerful disruption to the national economy and hospitals
may have been liquidity constrained during the recession.
My study examined whether hospital capital investment was
affected by liquidity constraints in the following periods:
pre-recession, during the recession, and during the recovery.
Furthermore, hospital ownership differences in liquidity
constraint were addressed. Ownership differences allow for
different financing mechanisms. Not-for-profit and public
hospitals do not have access to equity capital while investor-
owned hospital do, and hence investor-owned hospitals are
less likely to be liquidity constrained. If the effects of the
recession on capital investment were driven by a liquidity
constraint, policy changes that mitigate the information
asymmetry between hospitals and lenders may facilitate
hospitals to make timely capital investments even when
market conditions are turbulent.
Previous Literature
The capital structure of a firm is defined as how much of its
capital is composed of debt versus equity. The seminal
Modigliani-Miller5 theorem showed that in a perfect capital
market, the value of a firm is independent of its capital struc-
ture. In such a case, the value of a firm only depends on the
present value of the expected profits from its assets.
Therefore, a firm is indifferent between using debt or equity
to finance its investment.
Furthermore, in a perfect capital market, the cost of debt
and the opportunity cost of internal cash are equal; this
makes them perfect substitutes and makes the investment
decision of a firm independent of its ability to generate cash
flow.6-8 A perfectly functioning capital market allows a firm
with low current cash flow, such as a startup company, to
invest by raising equity and debt capital if a firm is expected
to generate high future profits.
Departing from the perfect capital market model, the lit-
erature on capital market imperfections has explored how
information problems in the capital market constrain the
investment decision of a firm.9-12 Investment models with a
liquidity constraint hypothesize that when lenders have less
information than a firm regarding the financial performance
of a firm, the cost of borrowing of a firm may be drastically
higher than its opportunity cost of using internal funds. If a
firm is liquidity constrained, then its investment should be
related to its cash flow because a firm must rely more on its
internal cash to fund investment.
Theoretical mechanisms through which the recession
affected hospital capital investment have not been investi-
gated in the health economics literature. A liquidity constraint
may be a mechanism through which the recession affected
hospital capital investment. The presence of a liquidity con-
straint among firms can be empirically tested using the fol-
lowing method: first, stratify the study population by the
predictor of liquidity constraint; second, for each stratum
estimate the effect of a liquidity variable (such as cash flow)
on investment controlling for the theoretical determinant of
investment (Tobin's Q or marginal product of capital).13 A
significant relationship between the liquidity variable and
investment suggests that firms are liquidity constrained.
Poor hospital cash flow led to cutbacks in hospital invest-
ments in plant and equipment among community hospitals
between 1995 and 2000.14 However, it is unclear whether
liquidity constraints were driving the relationship. Medicare
payment cuts resulting from the Balance Budget Act of 1997
and the growth of Health Maintenance Organizations during
that time period may have increased the risk of lending to
hospitals but the study did not address whether hospitals
were liquidity constrained.
Liquidity was strongly related to investment among small
non-system hospitals.15 System hospitals are less likely to
face financing constraints because they can diversify risk by
earning revenue from a wider range of services. Having
diverse revenue sources also means that system hospitals are
less likely to be affected by the disruptions in service lines or
fluctuations in the demand for services. Health information
technology systems can lower information asymmetries, but
at a high fixed cost, which system hospitals can spread out
over their affiliated hospitals. Also, system hospitals may
have greater negotiating power against payers and vendors to
generate higher profit.
Not-for-profit hospitals often carry large cash reserves to
smooth out fluctuations in revenues and expenses and to
improve their bond rating from credit rating agencies.16 In
response to a liquidity constraint, a not-for-profit hospital
may compensate for its low borrowing limit by using its cash
reserves in addition to cash flow to internally fund capital
investment or to improve access to debt from the capital mar-
ket. Although cash reserves may improve access to debt,
holding large cash reserves also has negative welfare impli-
cations for patients as those funds are tied up in reserves
instead of being used for hospital operations.
Methods
Theoretical Model
In a perfect capital market, the neoclassical model of invest-
ment specifies the capital investment decision of a hospital
manager as a dynamic utility maximization problem.6,7 The
hospital manager maximizes her profits over an infinite time
horizon by equating the marginal cost of capital investment
of today to the expected discounted marginal benefit of capi-
tal investment in the future. The optimal level of investment
I measured in dollars, which is normalized by capital stock
K measured in dollars, is a function of interest rate r (%)
and marginal product of capital MPK (equation 1).
Normalizing investment I to investment per dollar of capi-
tal I K is done by dividing the investment I by capital
stock K for hospital i at time t . Marginal product of
Choi 3
capital MPK is the change in hospital output in dollars from
a unit change in capital stock K :

When lenders do not have full information regarding the
ability of a hospital to service its debt, lenders may place a
liquidity constraint on the hospital by limiting the amount it
can borrow, raising the cost of borrowing, or requiring cash
reserves as collateral. A liquidity-constrained hospital, unable
to borrow debt, may fund capital investments internally with
cash. Hence, the capital investment decision by a liquidity-
constrained hospital should be related to its cash flow CF
.12,17 Cash flow measures the net cash inflows and outflows
from hospital operations. Cash inflows include payments
from payers and donations, and cash outflows include cash
expensed to pay for labor and supplies. In addition to cash
flow, liquid asset LA can be used to fund investment directly
or used as a collateral to lower the cost of debt. Liquid asset
includes cash reserves and marketable securities separate
from cash flow. Liquid asset should also be linked to invest-
ment in the presence of liquidity constraint (equation 2):

Empirical Model
I specified the empirical model based on the investment
model with liquidity constraint. Investment normalized by
capital I K is a function of cash flow CF , liquid asset LA
, interest rate r , and average product of capital APK . CF
and LA are normalized by K for hospital i at time t . t
is the year fixed effects. i is the hospital fixed effects. it

The marginal product of capital MPK captures the effect
of the marginal product of capital on investment derived
from the neoclassical model. However, the marginal product
of capital was unobserved in the data, thus substituted with
the average product of capital APK , which was specified as
operating revenue per capital. The substitution of marginal
product of capital with average product of capital is consis-
tent with the literature.17
I hypothesized that (1) hospitals were not liquidity con-
strained before the recession, (2) hospitals were liquidity
constrained during the recession, and (3) hospitals were not
liquidity constrained during the recovery. The recession may
have contributed to the information asymmetry between hos-
pitals and lenders because lenders expected the demand for
hospital services to fall like the rest of the economy, whereas
the demand for hospital services may actually have been less
affected. The Medicare population was probably not affected
by the weak labor market and the loss of private insurance
might have been partially offset by the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).
Information problem during the recession may have dis-
couraged capital investment by hospitals because lenders
limited how much hospitals can borrow, placing a liquidity
constraint. When unable to borrow debt due to liquidity con-
straint, hospitals may respond by using their own internal
cash to fund investment.
Alternatively, finding a significant relationship between
cash flow and investment in the pre-recession or recovery
period suggests that hospitals were chronically liquidity con-
strained, rather than the recession having an effect. Such find-
ing should raise further concerns about the inefficiencies in the
capital market that are preventing hospitals from investing.
Furthermore, finding a null relationship between cash flow
and investment during the recession suggests that hospitals
had access to a well-functioning capital market. Government
stimulus during the recession may have encouraged lending to
hospitals. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA) promoted banks to lend to the not-for-profit and
public sectors by expanding the definition of bank-qualified
bonds. Bank-qualified bonds allow issuers to sell bonds
directly to banks that reduce issuance costs. The banks who
purchase bank-qualified bonds benefit from tax incentives.
From 2009 to 2011, hospitals have taken advantage of bank-
qualified bonds to fund new capital projects.18,19
I anticipated average product of capital to have a signifi-
cant positive effect because increasing profitability of capital
should be related to higher capital investment. The coeffi-
cient on average product of capital captures the profit-seek-
ing behavior of hospitals. The investment model describes
how hospital investment decision is motivated solely by its
profit-maximizing objective. This gross simplification
ignores how hospitals may seek to provide high-quality care
for their patients. The omission of quality and the resulting
endogeneity problem is further discussed in the identifica-
tion strategy section.
I tested the 3 hypotheses by stratifying the study popula-
tion into pre-recession, during-recession, and during-recov-
ery periods, then for each period estimating the empirical
model. Significant and positive beta coefficients for either or
both cash flow and liquid asset are evidence of liquidity con-
straint in the given period.
Although the recession was dated between 2007 and 2009
nationally, the effect of the recession may have lagged for the
hospital industry. A drop in employer-sponsored insurance
would have lagged behind the recession because COBRA
allows people who lost their jobs to continue their coverage.
To account for the lag, years 2008 to 2010 were set as the
recession period and 2002 to 2006 were set as the pre-reces-
sion period. Year 2007 was excluded because it was a transi-
tion period with 11 months out of the year not in recession.
4 INQUIRY
Ownership differences may contribute to liquidity constraint.
Not-for-profit hospitals and public hospitals are more likely
to be liquidity constrained than investor-owned hospitals
because they cannot raise equity. During the recession, I fur-
ther stratified hospitals by ownership and tested for liquidity
constraint.
Identification Strategy
The estimation model (equation 3) contains endogenous
regressors and unobserved hospital effects that bias the ordi-
nary least squares (OLS) estimates. The regressors cash flow,
liquid asset, average product of capital, and interest rate are
endogenous to unobserved shocks related to capital invest-
ment and the direction of bias can be positive or negative.
For example, the service mission of a hospital to improve the
health of the community exerts a negative bias on the effect
of cash flow. A service activity with a quality objective rather
than a profit objective is negatively correlated with cash
flow. At the same time, investment is positively correlated
with service activity because equipment and facilities are
needed to carry out the service activity. In contrast, the repu-
tation of a hospital exerts a positive bias on the effect of cash
flow. Hospitals with a good reputation will attract patients;
thus, reputation is positively correlated with cash flow.
Simultaneously, hospitals invest more to maintain a good
reputation and thus reputation is positively correlated with
investment. Unobserved hospital effects, such as the perfor-
mance of the hospital manager, may affect both cash flow
and investment. OSHPD provides facility-level financial
data. System-level financial information and change in sys-
tem affiliation were not observed. System affiliation is likely
correlated with capital investment and other regressors.
Hospital fixed effects absorb the time invariant system
effects. Omitted time-varying system effects may bias the
OLS estimates. The system generalized method of moments
(system GMM) estimator was used to address the fixed
effects and endogeneity issues in the estimation model.
Exogeneity of instruments. System GMM estimates a system
of levels and differenced equations using the lags and lag
differences of the endogenous regressors as instruments for
the endogenous regressors. When the endogenous regressor
is persistent, lags and lag differences of the endogenous
regressors sufficiently removed from the contemporaneous
error term are exogenous. If the error term t is
Autoregressive(p) in the levels equation, x a p
t a
-  >
, is
used to instrument for the endogenous regressors xt . In the
differenced equation, x a p
t a
- +
( )  >
1
, is used to instrument
for the endogenous regressors xt .20 System GMM com-
bines the moment conditions for the differenced equation
with the moment conditions for the levels equation.21 Com-
pared with estimating the differenced equation alone, system
GMM improves the finite sample properties regarding the
bias and root mean squared error.
System GMM requires strong assumptions regarding the
lags and lag differences of the endogenous regressors.
Validity of the assumptions is rigorously tested in an appen-
dix which is available on request.Aprevious study using sys-
tem GMM identification strategy for estimating hospital
productivity yielded similar results to alternative identifica-
tion strategies for estimating production functions.22 System
GMM producing similar results to alternative identification
strategies provides support for the validity of using system
GMM with hospital financial data.
Decomposition
The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition technique was used to
decompose the change in hospital capital investment between
the pre-recession and during-recession periods.23,24 Hospital
observations from 2006 were selected as the pre-recession
group. Observations from 2009 were selected as the reces-
sion group. Using the GMM coefficient estimates from the
pre-recession period and during-recession periods, capital
investment was predicted in term of dollars and then sepa-
rated into the following components.
The effect of the recession due to the change in the esti-
mated coefficients was captured by the coefficient effect

Data
OSHPD collects financial data from about 450 not-for-profit
and investor-owned hospitals in California each year.25
Participating hospitals report detailed financial information
from balance sheets and income statements. OSHPD data
include all non-federal California hospitals. The study panel
was limited to short-term general acute-care hospitals
observed in years 2002 to 2012. Kaiser Permanente hospitals
were excluded because they do not report comparable finan-
cial data. Hospitals with reporting days less or greater than
365 (less or greater than 366 for leap years) were excluded.
A total of 311 hospitals (3168 observations) remained. Then
missing and out-of-range values (negative numbers in capital
stock or investment) were excluded because they are likely
to be data entry errors. The remaining 298 hospitals with an
unbalanced panel of 2557 hospital-year observations were
analyzed. Dollar amounts were adjusted to 2011 dollars
using the GDP deflator.26
Measures. Cash flow measures the net cash inflows and out-
flows from hospital operations at the end of the reporting
period. Liquid asset LA includes cash reserves and
Choi 5
marketable securities measured at the beginning of the
reporting period, which excludes cash flow earned in the cur-
rent reporting period. Liquid asset includes cash and market-
able securities reported as current assets; it excludes cash and
marketable securities whose use is limited. Interest rate r for
hospital i at time t was not observed in the data. Instead,
interest rate on outstanding long-term debt was observed.
The average interest rate on long-term debt was used a proxy
for interest rate. Average product of capital was measured as
operating revenue divided by capital at the end of the report-
ing period.
Results
The study data are summarized in Table 1. Pooling across
ownership types, hospitals had a mean annual capital invest-
ment of 12.5 million dollars, capital stock of 139.7 million
dollars, and investment per capital ratio of 0.098. Ownership
differences showed that investor-owned hospital invested
relatively more than others with a higher investment per cap-
ital ratio. Investor-owned hospitals also generated greater
returns from a dollar of capital with a higher average product
of capital than others. Investor-owned hospitals had the
smallest capital stock, about a third of the size of not-for-
profit hospitals and two thirds of the size of public hospitals.
The study hospitals comprised 1549 not-for-profit hospitals,
453 investor-owned hospitals, and 555 public hospitals.
Figure 2 shows the investment time trend separately
plotted for hospitals with high cash flow and low cash
flow. For each hospital, I calculated its mean cash flow in
the pre-recession period. Then I classified the hospitals
into high­ or low­cash flow group based on whether their
pre-recession mean cash flow was above or below the
median. Assuming the lack of liquidity constraint, trends
in investment prior to the recession should not vary by
cash flow status. During the recession, I expected hospitals
to be liquidity constrained. When liquidity constrained,
high­cash flow hospitals should invest more than low­
cash flow hospitals because hospitals are limited in how
much they can borrow and must use their own cash flow to
fund investment. Time trend in Figure 2 shows that up to
2008, trends in investment between the 2 groups track
closely; then the low­cash flow hospitals experienced a
sharper drop in investment between 2008 and 2009 com-
pared with the high­cash flow hospitals. The time trend is
consistent with the expectation, showing that high­cash
flow hospitals invested more than low­cash flow hospitals
during the recession.

I estimated the empirical model (equation) using system
GMM. Estimates are stratified by pre-recession (2002-
2006), during recession (2008-2010), and recovery (2011-
2012). In addition to the GMM estimates, fixed effects
regression estimates are reported for comparison. Pre-
recession period estimates are presented in Table 2. Cash
flow and liquid asset were not significantly related to
investment per capital for all hospitals, suggesting that hos-
pitals were not liquidity constrained in the pre-recession
period. The GMM estimate for average product of capital at
0.0331*** (P < .001) was significant and positive, and thus
investment per capital was significantly related to the prof-
itability of capital. The GMM estimate for average product
of capital was smaller than the fixed effects estimate
0.1155*** (P < .001), which implies that managerial per-
formance was positively biasing APK .
Recession period estimates are presented in Table 3. Cash
flow was significantly related to investment per capital, sug-
gesting that hospitals were liquidity constrained during the
recession. Increasing cash flow increased investment per
capital. The GMM estimate for cash flow at 0.1309** (P <
.01) was larger than the fixed effects estimate 0.0932***
(P < .001), which implies that quality was negatively biasing
cash flow.
The coefficient estimate for average product of capital
was significant and positive at 0.0307** (P < .01). Again, the
GMM estimate for average product of capital was smaller
than the fixed effects estimate. The average product of capi-
tal coefficient during the recession was smaller than the pre-
recession estimate, suggesting that investment decision was
less sensitive to the profitability of capital during the reces-
sion. Liquidity-constrained hospitals would be limited in
their borrowing, thus unable to invest even when there are
profitable investment opportunities.
Recovery period estimates are presented in Table 4. Cash
flow and liquid asset were not significantly related to invest-
ment per capital, suggesting that hospitals were not liquidity
constrained. The coefficient estimate for average product of
capital was significant and positive at 0.0457** (P < .01).
The average product of capital coefficient during the recov-
ery was larger than the recession estimate, suggesting that
hospitals were able to finance profitable investments by
borrowing.
Table 5 shows the during-recession GMM estimates by
ownership. Not-for-profit hospital investment was sensitive
to cash flow at 0.1878* (P < .05). Public hospital investment
was sensitive to liquid asset at 0.0871* (P < .05). Investor-
owned hospital investment was not related to cash flow or
liquid asset. These results suggest that during the recession,
not-for-profit and public hospitals were liquidity constrained.
Estimates for investor-owned hospitals were imprecise due

Diagnostic tests supported the validity of the system
GMM estimates. In each of the tables presented, the Hansen
test of joint validity of the instruments failed to reject the
null, showing no evidence that the instruments were not
exogenous. Also, over-instrumenting did not appear to be a
problem, as the Hansen test statistic was reasonably far from
1.00.27 The Arellano-Bond test for Autoregressive (2) in first
differences failed to reject the null, showing no evidence of
Autoregressive (1) auto-correlation in the levels equation.
Table 6 summarizes the decomposed change in hospital
capital investment between pre-recession and during reces-
sion. The residual recession effect is the change in baseline
capital investment between the 2 periods. The residual reces-
sion effect absorbs the change in capital investment unex-
plained by the predictors in the empirical model. The residual
recession effect was not significant.
During the recession, hospital investment was related to
cash flow, whereas in pre-recession it was not. The cash flow
coefficient effect increased capital investment by $2.45*(P <
.05) million. Change in cash flow between the pre-recession
group and the recession group was not statistically different.
The average product of capital coefficient effect, change in
average product of capital, interest rate coefficient effect,
and change in interest rate were not statistically different
between the pre-recession and the recession groups.
Alternative Specifications
I investigated the robustness of my results against alternative
specifications of the empirical model. The effect of cash flow
may vary by the level of liquid asset. The interaction term for
cash flow and liquid asset captures the substitution effect
between the two. System GMM estimates for the pre-reces-
sion, recession, and recovery periods including the interac-
tion term showed consistent results with hospitals being
sensitive to cash flow only during the recession period. The
interaction term was not significant in the 3 periods.
Investment may be persistent over time. A dynamic speci-
fication included the lagged dependent and independent vari-
ables to test for the presence of an autoregressive (1) error
component. The coefficient on the lagged dependent variable
was not significant, thus failing to reject the absence of serial
correlation in the error term.
The theoretical model and the subsequent empirical
model do not explicitly include debt as a predictor of capital
investment. However, debt may be correlated with interest
rate, because lenders may evaluate existing debt and interest
expense. Debt is likely to be correlated with capital invest-
ment because it is a funding source for capital investment.
Including debt as a predictor in the empirical model did not
change the coefficient estimates for cash flow and average
product of capital. Also, debt was not a significant
predictor.
Interest rate in the empirical model was defined as the
average interest rate on long-term debt. Long-term debt took

about 5 to 10 years to mature and it did not vary greatly from
year to year, which may explain why interest rate was never
a significant predictor. Alternatively, I tested the average
interest expense per debt as a proxy for interest rate and it
was not a significant predictor. The limitation with using
average interest expense per debt was that some hospitals
had interest expenses greater than debt, which made the ratio
implausible.
OSHPD data capture limited use cash and limited use
securities. Limited use securities, specifically stocks and
bonds, are mainly invested in mutual funds or exchange-
traded funds, which can be liquidated within a week. The
restrictions on limited use assets may be set internally by
the board rather than an external agency; hence, hospitals
may have discretion over its limited use asset to fund
investment. However, only about 30% of the study hospi-
tals reported having limited use assets, most of them being
not-for-profits. Adding limited use cash and limited use
securities to the liquid asset variable did not change the
estimation results for the pre-recession, during, and recov-
ery periods.
Conclusion
During the recession, capital investment of California not-
for-profit and public hospitals was linked to their cash flow.
My findings suggest that these hospitals were liquidity con-
strained during the recession. The fixed effect estimates that
suffer from an endogeneity problem underestimated the rela-
tionship between cash flow and investment compared with
the system GMM estimates. The negative bias on cash flow
may be due to the unobserved quality objective of the hospi-
tal. Cash flow and liquid asset (cash reserves and marketable
securities) measure unrestricted assets that are not limited by
external restrictions. These variables should capture the deci-
sion of hospital managers, rather than external influences, on
how to allocate their cash flow and liquid asset to fund capi-
tal investment under liquidity constraint.
The California hospital market is unique because it has a
high managed care penetration and dominant multi-hospital
systems, specifically Hospital Corporation of America
(HCA), Sutter, and Dignity. Therefore, findings from my
study may not be reflective of other state markets. My study
excluded Kaiser Permanente hospitals, which are a major
competitor in California, and this exclusion thereby limits
the generalizability of my findings within California. For
multi-hospital systems, system-level financial data were not
available; thus, my findings are limited to describing hospi-
tal-level investment behavior.
A liquidity constraint arises when lenders are uncertain
about the ability of hospitals to service their debt and conse-
quently limit how much hospitals can borrow. If there had
been a perfectly functioning capital market, cash flow would
not have been related to investment. A liquidity constraint
drives hospitals to generate large cash flows to fund capital
investment rather than spending on expenses related to the
provision of health care. Hospital management can reduce
expenses by cutting hospital staff, delaying wage payments,
and closing service lines. Trading off operating expenses for
capital investment may have adverse short-run consequences.
Areduction in hospital staff may worsen patient outcomes by
increasing provider error.
Not-for-profit hospitals hold a significantly greater pro-
portion of asset as unrestricted cash and marketable securi-
ties than investor-owned hospitals.28 Not-for-profit hospitals
cannot raise equity capital, which gives them less flexibility
when raising capital compared with investor-owned hospi-
tals. Because of this limitation, credit rating agencies empha-
size days-cash-on-hand, which is the amount of cash on hand
to meet operating expenses, when rating not-for-profit hospi-
tals.29,30 Having more cash and marketable securities help
not-for-profit hospitals improve their bond ratings and lower
the cost of debt. In contrast, investor-owned hospitals are
less concerned about using internal cash to fund investments
or improving their credit rating because of their broader
access to external funds. It is important to note that agency

problems associated with excess cash may influence invest-
ment behavior of hospitals, which would obscure the rela-
tionship between cash and investment. Among not-for-profit
firms, excess cash was not associated with increased invest-
ment, but with higher manager compensation.31
The effect of cash flow on investment varied by hospital
ownership. During the recession, capital investment of not-
for-profit hospitals was sensitive to cash flow; capital invest-
ment of public hospitals was sensitive to liquid asset. But
capital investment of investor-owned hospitals was not
related to either. These findings suggest that during the reces-
sion, not-for-profit and public hospitals were liquidity con-
strained. For investor-owned hospitals, cash flow and liquid
asset were not significantly linked to capital investment, sug-
gesting no evidence of liquidity constraint. Investor-owned
hospitals can raise equity to fund capital investments,
whereas not-for-profit and public hospitals cannot. This
institutional difference makes investor-owned hospitals less
susceptible to liquidity constraint.
Decomposing the change in hospital capital investment
between pre-recession and during recession did not reveal a
significant drop in capital investment. The average decrease
in capital investment is the change in capital investment
while holding constant the effects of cash flow and other pre-
dictors in the empirical model. This change in capital invest-
ment unexplained by the model, or the residual effect,
includes the net of the pre-recession year fixed effect and the
during-recession fixed effect. Thus, any policy changes
affecting capital investment is captured by the residual effect.
However, the large uncertainty around the estimated residual
effect makes it unclear how policy changes, such as the gov-
ernment stimulus funds going to hospitals through ARRA,
affected hospital capital investment.
Hospitals responded to the recession by using cash flow
to offset the effect of restricted borrowing. Capital invest-
ment was more sensitive to cash flow during the recession,
which increased capital investment by $2.45* (P < .05) mil-
lion, other things equal. The cash flow effect isolates the
change in capital investment due to the change in coefficient
estimate for the pre-recession group and the recession group.
The interval estimates in Table 6 reflect two sources of
uncertainty: (1) uncertainty around the coefficient estimates
and (2) uncertainty around the variables. Using bootstrap
sampling, for each sample drawn I estimated the empirical
model coefficients and then inserted them into the Blinder-
Oaxaca equation for decomposition. Low precision in the
coefficient effect is likely due to large variations in the beta
coefficient among the bootstrap samples. Stratifying the pop-
ulation by ownership did not improve the precision of the
bootstrap confidence intervals. In Tables 2 and 3, the coeffi-
cient on liquid asset was significantly positive in the pre-
recession period, and then negative but not significant during
the recession. I suspect that the relationship between liquid
asset and investment was mixed because hospitals may be
holding it as a collateral for debt rather than using it to
directly fund investment. Average product of capital was sig-
nificantly positive in the pre-recession period and signifi-
cantly positive during the recession; the coefficient did not
change much in size (0.0331 to 0.0307). Hence, the small
change between periods would yield an estimate close to
zero. Interest rate suffered from measurement noise, which
may explain the wide uncertainty around its coefficient
effect.
The unexpected estimation results for liquid asset chal-
lenge the hypothesized relationship between liquid asset and
capital investment. During the recession, the coefficient on
liquid asset was negative and not significant. The negative
estimate for liquid asset, where a positive estimate was
expected, raises the question of multi-collinearity due to the
correlation between cash flow and liquid asset. In the pooled
data, the Pearson correlation coefficient between cash flow
and liquid asset was 0.11; during the recession it was .24.
Both coefficients suggest a low correlation between the 2
variables. Removing 1 of the 2 variables from the estimation
model did not change the result for the other. For the reces-
sion period, estimating the investment model without liquid
asset resulted in a positive and significant cash flow coeffi-
cient; estimating the investment model without cash flow
resulted in a negative but not significant liquid asset coeffi-
cient. Overall, the robustness checks did not provide strong
evidence of multi-collinearity.
If the imprecise coefficient estimate for liquid asset is
unbiased and truly negative, a negative relationship between
liquid asset and capital investment is nonetheless counterin-
tuitive. Fluctuations in operating revenue and costs during
the recession may have prompted hospitals to build its liquid
assets at the expense of cutting investments. But it is not
obvious why increasing liquid asset decreases investment
when increasing cash flow increases investment, given that
they are both internal funds that can be used at discretion by
hospitals.
Because the negative coefficient on liquid asset was not
significant, I am more comfortable interpreting the coeffi-
cient as a null instead of a negative. A null relationship
between liquid asset and capital investment is also inconsis-
tent with expectation. Among not-for-profit hospitals, hold-
ing more liquid asset should improve their bond rating,
which facilitates the debt financing of capital investment.
Because a certain level of liquid asset is needed to meet the
days-cash-on-hand requirement by credit rating agencies,
not-for-profit hospitals may not have been able to use liquid
asset to directly fund investment. Another motive for hospi-
tals to hold liquid asset is to engage in indirect arbitrage by
borrowing funds at the tax-exempt interest rate while using
the liquid asset to generate returns in the taxable market.
For some hospitals, shift in financing strategy to bank
direct placements in response to the collapse of the auction
rate bond market in 2008 may have diminished the role of
liquid asset in financing capital investment. Hospitals can
directly sell their bond to banks through a direct placement,
10 INQUIRY
which eliminates the need for a credit rating agency. In addi-
tion, a direct placement does not require a debt service
reserve fund, which is cash set aside to service debt. Hence,
a bank direct placement uncouples liquid asset from access
to debt.
A liquidity-constrained hospital with poor cash flow is
likely to fall behind on making the capital investment neces-
sary for its operations and face the risk of closure. Hospitals
with low cash flow tend to be small rural hospitals that pro-
vide care to underserved populations. During an economic
recession when poor financial performance is due to the
external environment rather than the hospital management,
access to debt is critical for hospitals to endure the recession.
Policy changes that reduce payments to hospitals may dis-
courage liquidity-constrained hospitals from investing in
capital.
The relationship between average product of capital and
capital investment diminished during the recession, although
the change in coefficient was not statistically significant.
Capital investment may have been forgone during the reces-
sion because of greater uncertainty regarding the return on
investment, even though the investment may have been prof-
itable. The implications of the forgone profitable investment
for patient welfare depend on who is the residual claimant of
hospital profits. Profits from investment may be returned to
the community, which in theory defines not-for-profit orga-
nizations, or may be used to improve the quality of hospital
services. Decreased profits from investment would decrease
patient welfare because less residual surplus is returned to
patients. However, forgoing profitable investment that pro-
vides no medical benefit to patients but only generates prof-
its for the hospital manager would be beneficial to patient
welfare.
Prior to the great recession, auction rate bonds and vari-
able rate demand bonds were financing strategies available
to hospitals that offered short-term interest rates on long-
term maturities. Auction rate bonds were especially attrac-
tive to issuers because of low financing costs. During the
subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, the auction rate bond mar-
ket collapsed and the variable rate demand bond market was
volatile. Facing spikes in interest rates, many hospitals that
held these variable rate bonds refinanced into long-term
bonds.32-35 Hospitals moving into fixed rate long-term bonds
during the recession may explain why interest rate did not
vary year to year in the data.Also, direct placements between
hospitals and banks steadily grew between 2008 and 2011. In
a direct placement, hospitals directly issue bonds to banks
instead of public offerings. Regulation and accounting guide-
lines surrounding direct placements were unclear during the
time,36-37 and hence direct placements may not have been
captured in the OSHPD financial data.
My study provides evidence of liquidity constraint among
California not-for-profit and public hospitals during the
recession. The theoretical cause of this liquidity constraint is
asymmetric information, a market failure that warrants
policy intervention. Leading up to the recession, municipal
bond market disclosures had shortcomings regarding their
timeliness, frequency, and completeness compared with the
private bond market.38 These issues may have exacerbated
the volatility in the municipal bond market in 2008. Securities
and Exchange Commission made rule changes in 2010 aimed
to provide more information to investors in a timely man-
ner.39 The rule changes made certain information, including
official statements, continuing disclosure, and real-time
trade price, available online to the public.40 The lack of trans-
parency in the financial disclosures of not-for-profit hospi-
tals may have disastrous consequences such as the failure of
the Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation.
Policy interventions that mitigate the problem of asymmetric
information between hospitals and lenders may alleviate
liquidity constraints during economic downturns. Improving
hospital access to debt for investing in new equipment and
facilities is critical for maintaining and improving the quality
of hospital services.
