Attendance in Later Life: Barrier and/or
Benefit Mechanism?

Objectives. Why do some studies report a negative relationship between religious service attendance and functional
limitations? Two possible mechanisms, the health benefit mechanism and the functional barrier mechanism, were sys-
tematically examined.
Methods. With 2 waves of a national probability sample of adults aged 60 years and older, this research used struc-
tural equation models to estimate the influence of these 2 mechanisms.
Results. Results indicated that functional limitations were associated with less frequent religious service attendance
at the same wave, largely because of the barrier mechanism; no support was found for the benefit mechanism. Neither
mechanism was significant over time.
Discussion. Findings suggest that there is a temporal and salient decline in social activities such as religious service
attendance when lower body functional limitations are highest. However, long-term engagement in religious service at-
tendance is not predicted by baseline functional limitations, indicating that there are not long-term declines in attendance
because of higher levels of functional limitations.
HE role that religion plays in health, long neglected in
scholarly research, has drawn considerable attention in
the past decade. A good portion of the research has revealed
a positive relationship between religion and health among
older people, but the precise mechanisms that explain this
relationship remain to be clarified.
Participation in a religious group has been shown to have
health benefits. For instance, older adults who attend regu-
larly tend to have better health (Idler & Kasl, 1992, 1997b).
However, some scholars have argued that experiencing seri-
ous health problems can actually be a barrier to religious
participation (Ainlay, Singleton, & Swigert, 1992; Barusch,
1999). Thus, adults with greater physical limitations may be
unable or less willing to attend religious services, leaving
the more healthy adults in the religious group. As Levin and
Vanderpool (1987, p. 593) observed: "Correlations between
health and religious attendance may, in reality, represent
correlations between health and functional health (i.e., the
capability to get out of bed and go to services)."
There may be two processes at work: the benefit mecha-
nism and the barrier mechanism. Persons who are active in
religious groups may receive health benefits through that
participation, which is considered the benefit mechanism.
However, functional limitations may be a barrier to frequent
or even regular activity within the religious group. It is pos-
sible that both processes occur simultaneously. Participation
in religious groups may spur better functional health, but
this may only occur for those who are healthy enough to
participate in the first place. Most empirical research to date
has focused only on the benefit mechanism and has been de-
rived from a cross-sectional research design.
Our purpose in the present research was to consider the
link between religious service attendance and functional
limitations by systematically examining whether both bene-
fit and barrier mechanisms are at work--and if so, which is
stronger. We used longitudinal data from a national proba-
bility community sample to examine the competing influ-
ences of functional limitations and religious service atten-
dance among older adults. We used structural equation
models to test simultaneously the effects of religious service
attendance as a benefit mechanism and functional limita-
tions as a barrier mechanism across time.
Functional Limitations and Religious Attendance
Many researchers have reported that the practice of reli-
gion has salutary effects on health for individuals (Ainlay et
al., 1992; Chatters, 2000; Hummer, Rogers, Nam, & Elli-
son, 1999; Idler, 1987; Krause, 1998; Levin, 1996; Levin &
Chatters, 1998; Levin & Vanderpool, 1991; Oman & Reed,
1998; Strawbridge, Shema, Cohen, & Kaplan, 2001; Witter,
Strock, Okun, & Haring, 1985), especially older persons
(Idler & Kasl, 1997a, 1997b). Participation in a religious
group can have health benefits including lower risk of mor-
tality (Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997), less
depression (Koenig et al., 1997), and better overall mental
health (Levin & Chatters, 1998).
Most of the research on the effect of religious participa-
tion on physical health has focused on subjective health
(Ainlay et al., 1992; Drevenstedt, 1998; Ferraro & Albrecht-
Jensen, 1991). The relationship between religious service
attendance and subjective health has been well documented
in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (Ellison,
T
S366 KELLEY-MOORE AND FERRARO
1991; Idler, 1987; Idler & Kasl, 1997a). Persons who regu-
larly attend religious services are more likely to rate their
health better.
A much smaller body of research on religion and physical
health has demonstrated that religious service attendance in-
fluences functional limitations, with attendance providing a
protective effect (Idler & Kasl, 1997b). Using the New Ha-
ven sample of the multiwave Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, Idler and Kasl exam-
ined the effect of religious service attendance on functional
disability over time. The effect may be temporary for those
experiencing health decline, but religious service attendance
and functional disability are negatively correlated. This
means that those who attend religious services more fre-
quently tend to have fewer functional limitations. This study
used a sample of a single community, however, and no at-
tention was given to the simultaneous effect of physical
function on service attendance.
In considering this negative association between func-
tional limitations and religious service attendance, the liter-
ature suggests two separate mechanisms for the relation-
ship. The first is the benefit mechanism, described by Idler
(1987) and Idler and Kasl (1992, 1997b). They and others
have argued that the experience of religious participation,
manifested in fellowship, ritual, and ideology, is beneficial
to health, thereby decreasing the risk of functional limita-
tions (Levin, 1996).
The exact reasons why religion positively affects physi-
cal health have been systematically studied and, despite dif-
ferences in samples and measurement, have produced
strong and consistent results (Chatters, 2000; Levin, 1996;
Strawbridge et al., 2001). Activity within a religious group
may provide social support from other group members,
which has been demonstrated to buffer the effect of stres-
sors on health, including functional limitations (Newsom &
Schulz, 1996; Strawbridge et al., 2001). In addition, reli-
gious ideology may offer positive coping mechanisms,
which would help provide meaning for existing pain (Ko-
tarba, 1983). Research has shown that individuals who use
positive religious coping tend to have better health or are
better able to control pain from chronic conditions (Keefe et
al., 2001; Koenig, Pargament, & Nielsen, 1998). Finally,
some religious groups have proscriptive behavior norms, in-
cluding abstention from alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and
meat. Active, committed members may be more likely to
follow these norms as a demonstration of their faith, simul-
taneously avoiding many potentially disabling health prob-
lems such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes (Levin &
Vanderpool, 1987; Strawbridge et al., 2001).
For the benefit mechanism, the causal ordering places
service attendance before functional limitations, positing
that religion has a salutary effect on health. This interpreta-
tion has been offered repeatedly, but some have argued that
conclusions about the salutary effects of religious atten-
dance on health may be overstated because the second mech-
anism has not been considered (Levin & Vanderpool, 1987).
The second mechanism posits that functional limitations
hinder participation in religious social life; disabled persons
may have a difficult time getting to and sitting through reli-
gious services. Functional limitations may not hamper par-
ticipation in meditative and mystical dimensions of religios-
ity, but especially for older people, functional limitations
may make attendance at religious services a difficult experi-
ence (e.g., rituals requiring kneeling or standing for long pe-
riods of time, inability to dress oneself to go to services).
Whether functional limitations impede social participation
in religious activities has been studied by several research-
ers, but only cross-sectionally (Ainlay et al., 1992; Barusch,
1999). However, they found that higher levels of functional
limitations were associated with lower religious participation.
Persons with moderate to severe levels of functional limi-
tations may face a variety of obstacles such as stairs, manual
doors, or standard-sized parking spaces, which may be
physical barriers to social engagement. Even before arriving
at the place of worship, functional limitations may prevent
an older adult from buttoning a shirt or brushing hair. Older
adults often experience an increase in functional limitations
because of chronic illness. Even among older adults who
believe they do not have a disability, 21% can be classified
as disabled according to activities of daily living measure-
ments--and another 40% have mild or moderate disability
(Langlois et al., 1996). Often these persons who believe
they do not have a disability attribute their limited mobility
and inability to perform daily functions to "old age" or "get-
ting older" (Williamson & Fried, 1996).
Nevertheless, older adults tend to have stronger religious
beliefs and higher levels of participation in religious activities
compared with younger adults (Moberg, 1997). At a time
when functional limitations may be steadily limiting mobil-
ity, there are still markedly higher rates of public and private
religious behaviors among older adults, even those with se-
vere functional limitations (Idler, 1987). However, other re-
search has demonstrated that attendance at religious services
wanes as functional limitations increase (Barusch, 1999).
Although both the physical barrier and the health benefit
mechanisms have been examined in previous research, we
are unaware of any study that considered the two mecha-
nisms simultaneously with longitudinal data. Thus, our pur-
pose in this research was to examine the two mechanisms
simultaneously by addressing two overarching research
questions. First, do functional limitations curb attendance at
religious services for older adults? Second, if both the bene-
fit and the barrier mechanisms are at work, which is the
stronger of the two? Although religious service attendance
is only a single indicator of overall religiosity, it was the pri-
mary outcome in this analysis because it captures the physi-
cal act of going to a religious service. Private religious be-
haviors and beliefs may not vary among older adults by
health status, but functional limitations could create a bar-
rier to active social engagement at the place of worship
(Hays et al., 1998). On the basis of previous literature, we
expected that the health benefits received from religious
service attendance would outweigh the negative effect of
functional limitations on attendance.
METHODS
Sample
The data used in this study were from Americans' Chang-
ing Lives (ACL), a national multistage probability sample
FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AND ATTENDANCE S367
in the continental United States, directed by House (1990).
The original sample was 3,617 adults aged 18 and older,
with an oversample of African Americans and persons aged
60 years and older. In this study we used a subsample of
adults who were aged 60 years and older and were not insti-
tutionalized or living in group quarters (N  1,617). The
baseline data were collected in 1986 and the respondents
were followed up in 1989 (N  1,282), referred to as Wave
1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2), respectively. These data were
ideal for this analysis because they provided a nationally
representative sample of adults aged 60 and older who were
followed up almost 3 years later. The survey also included
repeated measures of both religious service attendance and
functional limitations.
Both waves of the ACL occurred before the 1990 Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act, which required facilities to be ac-
cessible for those who have physical limitations. Religious
organizations were among the many institutions targeted for
their facilities that were disability "unfriendly." The results
from this study are still applicable in that religious rituals
with repeated standing and kneeling may not have changed,
even if the physical plant did. Thus, even though group
members may be sympathetic to older adults who have dif-
ficulty or cannot perform the activity or ritual, older individ-
uals may still feel social embarrassment or stigma.
Measures
Religious service attendance, measured at both waves,
was one of the endogenous variables in the analysis. It was
measured by the question, "How often do you usually attend
religious services?" The six response categories at each
wave were scored "never" (1), "less than once a month" (2),
"once a month" (3), "2Â­3 times a month" (4), "once a week"
(5), and "more than once a week" (6).
We included binary variables indicating religious prefer-
ence in the analysis to control for differences in religious
service attendance norms (these were not available at the
follow-up survey). Respondents were asked at baseline,
"What is your religious preference?" Five response catego-
ries were available: Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Other, or
None. Immediately following, respondents were asked to
identify their specific religious group within the broad cate-
gory. From these responses, we created several binary vari-
ables to highlight specific religious preferences, including
Jewish, conservative Protestant, Catholic, Southern Baptist,
other Protestant, and no religious preference. Preliminary
analyses of these variables on both functional limitations
and religious service attendance revealed that only two reli-
gious preferences were significant: conservative Protestant
and no religious preference. Conservative Protestants (27%
of total sample) including Fundamentalist denominations
(e.g., Church of God, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, and
Church of Christ) and Southern Baptists, generally had
higher rates of attendance. No religious preference (7% of
total sample) was for all those who responded "none" when
asked to specify a religion.
Three other religion indicators were used: religious belief
salience, how often the respondent read religious materials,
and how often the respondent watched or listened to reli-
gious programming. For belief salience, respondents were
asked, "In general, how important are religious or spiritual
beliefs in your day-to-day life?" Four response categories
were used: "very important" (4), "fairly important" (3), "not
too important" (2), and "not at all important" (1). For the
other two religion variables, the possible answer choices
ranged from "never" (1) to "more than once a week" (6).
Attendance at religious services was measured with one
item at each wave; functional limitations, the other endoge-
nous variable in the analysis, was a latent variable with four
indicators at each wave. The first indicator was self-rated
activity limitation: "How much are your daily activities lim-
ited in any way by your health or health-related problems?"
Five categories followed ranging from "not at all" (1) to "a
great deal" (5). The second indicator of functional limita-
tions was a dichotomous self-report of whether the respon-
dent was restricted to a bed or chair all day (all others were
zero). The final two indicators were the amount of difficulty
the respondent had walking blocks and the amount of diffi-
culty the respondent had climbing stairs. The categories
ranged from "none" (1) to "cannot do" (5).
Baseline morbidity was included as an exogenous vari-
able. It was a sum of 10 possible health conditions, asked of
each respondent: "We would like to know if you have expe-
rienced any of the following health problems during the last
12 months. Have you had (specific condition)?" The condi-
tions were arthritis, stroke, foot problems, heart attack or
trouble, incontinence, diabetes, lung problems, hyperten-
sion, broken bones, and cancer.
Three indicators of social integration were included as
exogenous variables. Research has indicated that social net-
works have positive effects on the availability of resources
for those with disabilities (Idler & Kasl, 1997a). Therefore,
those who are active in the community or live with another
person may engage in social groups differently than those
who are less integrated.
The first social integration variable was whether the re-
spondent received help from another person or agency to
get around the community. Although it is not explicitly
stated in the question, this may include rides to religious
services. It was a binary variable, coded 1 for "yes" and 0
for "no." Second, frequency of attendance at voluntary as-
sociation meetings was measured with the question: "How
often do you attend meetings or programs of groups, clubs,
or organizations that you belong to?" Answer categories
ranged from "never" (1) to "more than once a week" (6).
Third, respondents who lived alone were identified with a
binary variable.
Depression was included as a control variable in the anal-
ysis because persons who have functional limitations may
be more likely to be depressed than nondisabled persons,
and depression may also be associated with more negative
ratings of physical limitations (Ainlay et al., 1992; Frerichs,
Aneshensel, Yokopenic, & Clark, 1982; Idler & Kasl, 1992;
Turner & Noh, 1988). Depression was measured with the
Center for Epidemiologic StudiesÂ­Depression (CES-D) short
scale of 11 items (Radloff, 1977).
Additional variables were included in the analysis as co-
variates. Age was measured in years (60Â­97). Education
ranged from "0Â­8 years" (1) to "17 years or more" (6). Total
family income was measured with 10 categories ranging
S368 KELLEY-MOORE AND FERRARO
from "less than $5,000" (1) to "more than $80,000" (10).
(Respondents were asked to point to the letter beside the
correct income range.) Two status characteristics were mea-
sured with dummy variables: Black and female, each coded
1 for "yes" and 0 for "no."
Table 1 provides a list of all variables used in the analysis
with the coding, means, and standard deviations of the sam-
ple. Endogenous indicators are listed first, followed by the
covariates or exogenous indicators. A number of additional
variables were tested in preliminary analyses based on ordi-
nary least squares but were deleted from further analyses
because they were not significantly related to either func-
tional limitations or religious service attendance. These
variables included being married, living in a southern re-
gion, and living in a rural region.
Method of Analyses
We used structural equation models estimated with LIS-
REL 8.30 (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993). Generalized least
squares were used as the estimation procedure because the en-
dogenous variables were not normally distributed (Bentler &
Bonett, 1980; Schumacker & Lomax, 1996). Estimates were
based on an asymptotic covariance matrix generated from
polychoric and polyserial correlations calculated in Prelis 2.30
(Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993; Schumacker & Lomax, 1996).
The hypothesized model in this research was a nonrecur-
sive model testing both the barrier and the benefit mecha-
nisms. Figure 1 is a simplified illustration of the proposed
structural relationships among the endogenous variables.
The model consisted of two endogenous variables at each
wave: functional limitations and religious service atten-
dance. It tested the simultaneous effects of functional limi-
tations and attendance on each other at baseline while con-
currently testing the lagged effects of baseline functional
limitations and attendance on the endogenous variables at
W2. No causal relationship was specified between atten-
dance and functional limitations at W2; however, the errors
between the two endogenous variables () were allowed to
correlate. We first tested this simple model without the co-
variates to avoid interpretational confounding (Burt, 1976).
Finally, the entire model was tested, including all of the co-
variates listed in Table 1.
The proposed model specified the barrier mechanism by
functional limitations affecting attendance at baseline and
across time. The benefit mechanism alternatively tested the
effect of attendance on functional limitations at baseline and
at W2 (Idler & Kasl, 1997b). Paths across time were mea-
sured for both functional limitations and attendance. In pre-
liminary analyses we modeled men and women separately.
Because there were no significant differences in either the

barrier or the benefit mechanisms, in further analyses we
proceeded with the total sample.
RESULTS
In addition to the proposed model, several alternative
models were tested. Table 2 shows the comparison of three
of these models with the hypothesized model (Model 1). Al-
ternative models included a recursive system where func-
tional limitations were specified as predicting attendance at
each wave, but with a lagged effect of attendance (W1) on
functional limitations at W2 (Model 2). The second alterna-
tive (Model 3) specified only the lagged effects of func-
tional limitations and religious service attendance on the
W2 endogenous variables. The errors were correlated in the
W1 equations and in the W2 equations. The final model was
one in which functional limitations and attendance pre-
dicted the other at each wave and attendance (W1) was
lagged on functional limitations at W2 (Model 4). As can be
seen in the table, the hypothesized model (Model 1) mani-
fested better goodness of fit, 2 (133, N  1,282)  137.62.
Other measures of goodness of fit indicated a satisfactory
model fit: root mean square error of approximation was .00
and adjusted goodness of fit index was .98. In addition, the
normed fit index was above the .90 threshold, and the com-
parative fit index was 1.00 (Bentler & Bonett, 1980; Kello-
way, 1998). Thus, the results from Model 1 are presented in
the following section. None of the alternative specifications
provided a better fit than Model 1.
The estimates for the measurement structure (
y
) are pre-
sented in Table 1. The 
y
value for each of the indicators
was greater than .80, and we placed equality constraints on
the functional limitations indicators across time to ensure
consistent measurement for change analysis (Hayduk,
1987). We estimated elements of the off-diagonal of the
theta-epsilon in previous models to correlate the measure-
ment errors among the variables measured at both waves.
Only one correlation was significant: between activity limi-
tations at baseline and at W2.
Parameter estimates for Model 1 are presented in Table 3.
Because the hypothesized baseline relationship between
functional limitations and attendance was nonrecursive,
each of the baseline endogenous variables required at least
one instrumental variable (Bollen, 1996).
The first equation (column 1 of Table 3) reveals that
greater levels of functional limitations were more common
among those who were older and more depressed. Higher
morbidity was also associated with more functional limita-
tions. As anticipated, socioeconomic status was also signifi-
cantly related to functional limitations; lower education and
lower income were associated with higher levels of func-
tional limitations. Those who needed help to get around the
community were likely to have greater functional limita-

tions at W1. In the nonrecursive model, there was a weak
positive relationship between baseline attendance and func-
tional limitations--the opposite of what one would expect
with the benefit mechanism.
The second equation in Table 3 shows that stronger reli-
gious beliefs, reading religious materials, and watching or
listening to religious media were associated with higher fre-
quency of attendance at religious services. Those who vol-
unteered frequently were also more likely to attend religious
services. In other words, those who engaged in religious and
social activities were also likely to attend the services of a
religious group.
At baseline, the path from functional limitations to atten-
dance was negative and significant (p  .01). As specified
in the barrier mechanism, this meant that those who had
higher functional limitations were less likely to attend reli-
gious services. Comparing the standardized slopes (not
shown) for the two mechanisms at baseline, functional limi-
tations had a stronger influence on attendance (.19) than
attendance had on functional limitations (.10). This pro-
vided clearer evidence in support of the barrier mechanism.
The third equation in Table 3 was for functional limita-
tions at W2. Results showed that those who were older and
had higher morbidity were more likely to be disabled. Per-
sons with more functional impairment at W1 were very
likely to have higher impairment at W2. The lagged effect
of W1 attendance on W2 functional limitations was nonsig-
nificant.
Finally, the fourth column in Table 3 shows the equation
for religious service attendance at W2. Just as for atten-
dance at W1, reading religious materials and volunteering
frequently were associated with higher religious service at-
tendance. Those who attended frequently at baseline were
more likely to attend frequently at W2.
Although the barrier mechanism was observed for the
baseline equation, it did not hold across time. Functional
limitations at W1 did not significantly affect religious ser-
vice attendance at W2 (although the slope was in the antici-
pated direction and close to significance). The correlated er-
ror () between functional limitations and attendance at W2
was also nonsignificant, indicating that there was little re-
sidual variation in the two constructs once their association
at baseline and their W1 values were considered. The over-
all model provided support only for functional limitations as
a barrier mechanism; no support was found for the religious
service attendance as a benefit mechanism among respon-
dents of ACL.
DISCUSSION
Two separate mechanisms for the relationship between
functional limitations and religious service attendance have
been proposed in the literature. The first is the benefit mech-
anism. Its proponents argue that religion, and specifically
religious service attendance, prevents or limits the conse-
quences of functional limitations (Idler & Kasl, 1992,
1997b). The second mechanism views functional limitations
as a barrier to effective social engagement, including atten-
dance at religious services. This process identifies the influ-
ence of functional limitations on the experience of religion,
especially religious activity (Ainlay et al., 1992; Levin &
Vanderpool, 1987).
Whereas much of the previous research used ordinary
least squares on cross-sectional data to investigate one or
the other of these mechanisms, this is the first study of

FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AND ATTENDANCE S371
which we are aware to use longitudinal data to test both
mechanisms. An advantage of this analysis is that both the
benefit and the barrier mechanisms were tested simulta-
neously with structural equation models.
Tests of several recursive and nonrecursive models do
not offer support for the benefit mechanism. Even when at-
tendance significantly affects functional limitations, the re-
lationship is weak and positive rather than negative. Those
who attend services frequently are more likely to have
slightly higher functional limitations. Although some may
argue that religious service attendance is deleterious to
functional ability, we think that the more reasonable inter-
pretation is that of a convergence of persons with physical
limitations--perhaps permanent ones--to religious settings.
Moreover, this effect is uncovered only when the nonrecur-
sive model is specified.
The conclusion is that many people with modest forms of
functional limitations continue to attend religious services.
Older adults, who are more likely to be disabled than
younger adults, tend to be more religiously active and attend
religious services more frequently (Moberg, 1997). Reli-
gion may be providing inspiration and meaning to those
with less severe forms of functional limitations.
In considering the lack of support for the benefit mecha-
nism in this study, it is important to recall that these models
do not measure whether religious service attendance affects
subjective health. It is entirely possible that going to reli-
gious services and activities has many health benefits in-
cluding lower depression and better subjective health--but
that attendance has no effect on whether a respondent can
walk up a flight of stairs. In addition, one of the four indica-
tors of functional limitations in this study is whether the re-
spondent is confined to a bed or chair all day. Respondents
whose health has deteriorated to the point that they are no
longer able to get out of bed are most likely not going to be
attending services. The significant barrier mechanism may
be capturing this effect.
A second possibility for why the benefit mechanism is
not supported is the uniqueness of the ACL sample. The
survey manifests a fairly high level of religiosity. For in-
stance, the modal response for religious belief salience was
"very important," and the modal response for frequency of
service attendance was "once a week." Idler and Kasl's
(1997a, 1997b) data are from New Haven, CT, an area with
a generally lower level of religious participation. Although
we tested for southern and rural residence in preliminary
models, one wonders if differences in sampling may ac-
count for our inability to replicate their findings.
No significant differences by gender or race are found in
these models. These findings are unexpected in light of the
empirically consistent health differences and religious ser-
vice attendance norms. White adults and men are less likely
to attend religious services or be privately religious (Levin,
Taylor, & Chatters, 1994). Women are more likely to be
disabled than men. In addition, there is a consistent health
differential between Whites and African Americans, includ-
ing physical function (Guralnik, Land, Blazer, Fillenbaum,
& Branch, 1993). Drevenstedt (1998) found that religious
service attendance significantly predicted self-rated health
for all Whites, as well as Black and Latino women, but it
was not a significant predictor for Black and Latino men.
The author concluded that if the sample sizes for Black and
Latino adults had been comparable to the White sample,
some of the relationships might have been significant. ACL
has an oversample of African Americans, providing the nec-
essary statistical power for the analyses in this study. The
lack of significant differences may indicate that the impact
of functional limitations on religious service attendance is a
universal experience of managing pain and physical limita-
tions regardless of gender or race. Future studies should ex-
amine the barrier and benefit mechanisms with multidimen-
sional measures of religiosity, especially public practice, to
determine if the relationship holds.
Although we find no support for the health benefit mech-
anism, the physical barrier mechanism is consistently sig-
nificant. The barrier mechanism is significant in both recur-
sive and nonrecursive models of cross-sectional relations,
but there is no longitudinal barrier effect. In other words,
much of the effect of functional limitations on religious ser-
vice attendance is immediate, reflecting the temporal sa-
lience of pain or incapacity on social engagement. This is
consistent with previous research on functional limitations,
which has argued that social withdrawal happens almost si-
multaneously with the functional limitations experienced
(Barusch, 1999).
Several features of the measure of functional limitations
constructed from the ACL should be considered in inter-
preting results supporting the barrier mechanism. First, the
ACL measures include both objective and subjective ele-
ments. Decisions about whether to attend religious services
or engage in any social activity are based on the respon-
dent's perceived level of ability rather than actual level. The
measure of functional limitations used here combines the
objective and subjective responses to capture both func-
tional ability and perceptions of function.
Second, the measure of functional limitations focuses on
mobility or lower body function (whether the respondent is
in a bed or chair all day, the level of difficulty walking
blocks, and the level of difficulty climbing stairs). The expe-
rience of physical limitations varies from person to person
on the basis of the type of health condition and how much
help is needed to maneuver. In addition, persons with lower
body functional limitations tend to be much less mobile than
persons with exclusively upper body limitations (Clark, Mun-
gai, Stump, & Wolinsky, 1997; Ferrucci et al., 1998). The
measurement model developed from the ACL targets those
who have trouble walking, driving, or sitting for long periods
of time--all of which are often needed for full participation
in a religious group. This is a claim for data strength when
some may argue that it is a weakness. The negative relation-
ship between functional limitations and religious service at-
tendance, at baseline and over time, demonstrates how those
with lower body limitations may be more likely to disengage
from social activities because of pain, incapacity, or the awk-
wardness associated with reduced mobility. At the same
time, it is possible that the measures available in ACL make
it more difficult to uncover the benefit mechanism. Perhaps
the benefit effect found in other studies is a result of physical
function measures that combine upper and lower body dis-
ability. Many researchers have used scales originally devel-
S372 KELLEY-MOORE AND FERRARO
oped by Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffee (1963),
Rosow and Breslau (1966), and Nagi (1965) that were de-
signed to encompass both upper and lower body mobility
(Ainlay et al., 1992; Idler, 1987; Idler & Kasl, 1992, 1997a,
1997b). Unfortunately, ACL does not have measures of up-
per body function. Future research should examine the rela-
tionship between religious service attendance and domain-
specific functional limitations.
Another limitation of the present study is the limited reli-
gion variables available in the ACL. The demonstration of a
negative relationship between functional limitations and at-
tendance reflects the level of social engagement in the reli-
gious group. This outcome is of primary interest because it
captures the physical act of getting to the religious service.
We make no inferences about the private religious behav-
iors of persons who have functional limitations. Physical
health problems may not necessarily act as a barrier to
prayer or personal faith. Respondents were never asked
about their frequency of prayer and were only asked about
consuming religious media (watching/listening to religious
programs, reading religious materials) at W1. Religious ser-
vice attendance was the only religious behavior measure
asked about again at W2. Other religious practices could be
substituted for declining attendance, but we cannot test
these effects with ACL.
The literature offering support for the benefit mechanism
has a preponderance of studies that rely on more subjective
health measures such as self-rated health or well-being
(Ainlay et al., 1992; Ferraro & Albrecht-Jensen, 1991). In
addition, there clearly are some studies that support the ben-
efit thesis on other outcomes such as morbidity and mortal-
ity (Hummer et al., 1999; Idler & Kasl, 1997a, 1997b;
Oman & Reed, 1998; Strawbridge et al., 1997). Although
the benefit thesis may apply to certain types of functional
limitations, there is no evidence in the ACL survey that it
exists once one considers both mechanisms simultaneously.
Without entertaining the possibility of a barrier process, it is
possible that one may overestimate the benefit mechanism.
Persons with disabilities may find it difficult to partici-
pate in social settings, including religious groups, that are
not conducive to their needs. Repeated standing and sitting,
and sometimes kneeling, during a religious service can be
much more difficult for those who have physical limita-
tions. The findings from this research demonstrate that
functional limitations are associated with lower levels of re-
ligious service attendance and offer no support for the hy-
pothesis that attendance reduces functional limitations. Re-
ligious service attendance may benefit various dimensions
of health, but such benefits can only accrue if the person is
functionally capable of attending. The present research
shows the importance of the barrier mechanism and the util-
ity of simultaneously considering both the barrier and bene-
fit mechanisms.
