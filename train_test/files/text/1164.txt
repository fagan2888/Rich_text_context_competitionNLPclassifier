Maternal Depressive Symptoms, Father's
Involvement, and the Trajectories of Child Problem
Behaviors in a US National Sample
Jen Jen Chang, PhD; Carolyn T. Halpern, PhD; Jay S. Kaufman, PhD
Objective: To examine the effect of maternal depres-
sive symptoms on child problem behavior trajectories and
how the father's positive involvement may modify this
association.
Design: Secondary data analysis using data from the Na-
tional Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
Setting: A nationally representative household sample
of men and women from the National Longitudinal Sur-
vey of Youth.
Participants: The study sample includes 6552 mother-
child dyads interviewed biennially between January 1,
1992, and December 31, 2002; children were 0 to 10 years
old at baseline.
Intervention: Past-week maternal depressive symp-
toms in 1992.
Main Outcome Measures: Maternal self-reports of
child internalizing and externalizing behaviors were
assessed repeatedly using a modified Child Behavior
Checklist.
Results: Linear growth curve models indicate that the
adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms on child
problem behavior trajectories become negligible after con-
trolling for the father's involvement and other covari-
ates, including the child's age, sex, and race/ethnicity; the
mother's educational level; maternal age at child birth;
number of children; poverty status; urban residence; and
father's residential status. Positive involvement by the fa-
ther was inversely associated with child problem behav-
ior trajectories. The effects of maternal depressive symp-
toms on child problem behaviors varied by the level of
the father's positive involvement.
Conclusion: When the father actively compensates for
limitations in the depressed mother's functioning, the
child's risk of problem behaviors may be reduced.

THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN
maternal depression and
child problem behavior has
been widely documented.1
Children of depressed par-
ents display problems such as difficult tem-
perament, aggression, poor self-esteem,
poor peer relations, depressed mood, in-
secure attachment patterns, and atten-
tion deficits.1-3 Children's behavior prob-
lems may be indicators of the beginning
of mental health problems.4
Most research on the effects of mater-
nal depression on offspring has focused on
early childhood development and is lim-
ited by various methodological problems,
including small sample sizes, cross-
sectionaldesign,imprecisemeasuresofma-
ternal depression and child outcomes, and
incorrect statistical modeling for data with
clusterstructures.5-7 Longitudinalstudiesex-
amining the adverse effects of maternal de-
pression have begun to emerge in the past
decade. However, the few studies with lon-
gitudinal designs have usually covered only
limited periods of child development (ie,
childhoodoradolescencebutnotboth)and
often have included child outcome mea-
sures from only 1 or 2 time points.8-18 For
example, Radke-Yarrow et al9 assessed the
change in problem behaviors over 3 years
among young children of depressed moth-
ers. They found that children of depressed
mothers had more disruptive and depres-
sive problems than those of nondepressed
mothers. Furthermore, children's problem
behaviors increased over time, and the con-
tinuity of problems was greater among chil-
dren of depressed mothers compared with
children of nondepressed mothers.9 The
findings from this study enhanced our un-
derstanding of children of a depressed par-

ent during childhood, but the sample size was small, and
child problem behavior assessments included only 2 time
points. Longer-term longitudinal analyses spanning dif-
ferent developmental stages are needed to gain a better un-
derstanding of the effects of maternal depression on change
in child problem behaviors over time.
Despite the adversity of having a depressed mother,
many children exhibit competent adaptation to their ad-
verse environment.19 Little is known about protective fac-
tors associated with better outcomes for children of de-
pressed parents,20 but one factor is the availability of a
support system for a child,21 such as a good relationship
with at least 1 parent.22 The father's role has tradition-
ally been neglected in the child development litera-
ture.23,24 Some studies14,25-27 have found that fathers
have a positive effect on children's well-being, whereas
others28-30 have reported that fathers are peripheral to
certain child and adolescent outcomes. These mixed
findings may be attributed to the differences in the mea-
surement of the father's involvement, with some studies
reporting the frequency of paternal contacts and others
assessing the quality of the father's involvement.31
The present study examines the effects of maternal de-
pressive symptoms on the trajectories of offspring prob-
lem behaviors in childhood and early adolescence over
10 years. The study also evaluates the extent to which
the effect of maternal depressive symptoms on child prob-
lem behaviors varies by the level of the father's positive
involvement. This study was approved by the institu-
tional review board at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND SAMPLE
This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth (NLSY79).32 Since 1979, the NLSY79 has conducted in-
home interviews with a nationally representative household
sample of men and women to trace their labor market experi-
ences. Since 1986, detailed information about their biological
children, including each child's behavioral and social function-
ing, has been collected biennially. Each mother can be matched
with more than 1 biological child.32
The present investigation spans from January 1, 1992 (when
depressive symptoms were first included), to December 31, 2002.
Children eligible for the analysis sample were 0 to 10 years old
in 1992, were living with their biological mother, and must have
been interviewed at least once during the study period. Moth-
ers must have complete maternal depression data to be eli-
gible. This results in an analytic sample of 6552 children of 3197
NLSY79 mothers. The NLSY79 children are representative of
children born to women in the United States who were 21
through 29 years of age in 1986.
MEASURES
Maternal Depressive Symptoms
Maternal self-reported depressive symptoms were measured in
1992 using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies­Depression
(CES-D) scale. The CES-D scale is a 20-item self-report instru-
ment designed to assess the frequency of depressive symp-
toms experienced in the previous week.33 A higher score indi-
cates more depressive symptoms. The CES-D scale score was
dichotomized using the previously reported standard cutoff score
of 15 or higher to identify cases of depressive symptoms.34,35
The CES-D scale has been widely used as a measure of depres-
sive symptoms in epidemiologic research and as an initial screen-
ing tool for clinical depression in community-based samples.36,37
Behavior Problems
The behavior problems of children aged 4 to 14 years were as-
sessed biennially using the Behavioral Problems Index (BPI),
modeled after the Child Behavior Checklist.38 This instrument
is a listing of 28 specific childhood problem behaviors or symp-
toms designed to be administered relatively efficiently in the
context of a survey.32 The BPI has been used in many studies
of children's behavior problems.39 Mothers indicate whether the
symptom in question was typically exhibited by their child in
the past 3 months. Responses were summed into scales. Higher
scores indicate a higher level of behavior problems. Reliability
estimates of the total problem score range from 0.86 to 0.89.
Past research39 has shown that the BPI factors consist of 2 broad
constructs: internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depres-
sion, and externalizing problems, such as antisocial behavior,
peer problems, and hyperactivity. The Center for Human Re-
source Research has standardized BPI scores by age and sex based
on cross-sectional data of general population samples (mean
[SD], 100 [15]).39
Father's Positive Involvement
This measure applied to resident and nonresident fathers. The
father's involvement was based on 7 questions in the self-
administered supplement for children 10 years or older. Par-
ticipants were asked about how often their father talks over im-
portant decisions with the child, listens to the child's side of
an argument, knows who the child is with when not at home,
misses events or activities that are important to the child, whether
the child thinks the father spends enough time with him or her,
how well the father and child share ideas or talk about things
that really matter, and how close the child feels to the father.
Each question has 4 or 5 Likert-type response categories. Fac-
tor analysis indicated a 1-factor dimension for the 7 father in-
volvement items (=.95). Therefore, responses were summed
into a scale. Higher scores reflect higher levels of positive pa-
ternal involvement. The mean of the individual items was used
for the indicator of the father's involvement to include chil-
dren who did not have answers to all 7 corresponding ques-
tions in the analysis. To reflect the father's involvement over
time, this measure was coded as time varying from multiple
assessments.
Covariates
Child's sex was a 0/1 dummy variable, with a value of 1 being
male. Race/ethnicity was captured by two 0/1 dummy vari-
ables, one for black and the other for Hispanic, with 1 repre-
senting minority status. Maternal age at child birth was a con-
tinuous variable and was mean centered for easier variable
estimate interpretation.40 Mother's educational level was also
a mean-centered continuous variable reflecting the number of
years of schooling mothers reported as of January 1, 1992. Num-
ber of children was used to indicate how many minors were
living in the household. Most NLSY79 women were of child-
bearing age during the study. Family size may change over time.
Multiple assessments of number of children were used to cre-
ate a time-varying measure.

Familial poverty status compared the respondent's income
with the corresponding poverty threshold for the respon-
dent's family size and the year in which the interview was con-
ducted.32 Respondents whose income was below this thresh-
old were classified as being in poverty. Because family income
may fluctuate over time, poverty status was treated as a time-
varying measure with multiple assessments. Urban residency
was a 0/1 dummy variable. This measure was also coded as time
varying with multiple assessments. A time-varying binary resi-
dent father status indicator was constructed based on self-
reported data from children aged 10 to 14 years. The presence
of a resident father was indicated if a child reported living with
either a biological father or a stepfather.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
To accommodate the nested structure of the data and to ob-
tain unbiased estimates, growth curve analysis of hierarchical
linear modeling was performed.41 The growth curve models si-
multaneously estimate intra-individual time-based trajecto-
ries and test whether interindividual differences in the para-
meters of these trajectories are a function of time-invariant and
time-variant predictors.42 A general form of the full linear growth
curve model is as follows:

.
The variable Ajt
represents the maternal depressive symp-
toms measure. The vectors Xi
and Xj
include observed child-
and mother-specific factors, respectively, which may affect the
trajectories of child problem behaviors. The vectors µi
and µj
represent the time-invariant, unobserved child (i) and mater-
nal (j) factors that affect child behavior outcomes.
At each wave of NLSY79 data, the distributions of internal-
izing and externalizing scores were positively skewed. This vio-
lates the assumption of normality of the dependent variable for
linear growth curve modeling. Several transformations of out-
come measures were attempted. Among all, a log-transfor-
mation of the outcome subtracted by a constant yielded an ap-
proximately normal distribution of outcomes. Hence, this article
reports results based on the log-transformed outcome data.
RESULTS
The mean age of the children in 1992 was 5.6 years
(Table 1). The proportions of boys and girls were ap-
proximatelythesame(50.1%wereboys).Thereweremore
white (50.0%) than black (27.8%) or Hispanic (22.2%)
children. The mean (SD) child internalizing and exter-
nalizing scores in 1992 were both 104 (15). The mean
maternal age was 30.7 years. Most mothers had at least
a high school education (87.0%), reported living in an
urban area (81.5%), and had a mean of 2 children. The
mean maternal age at child birth was 27.6 years. Ap-
proximately 24% of the mothers lived in poverty, and
23.4% of women in the study sample reported having de-
pressive symptoms. Most children (67.4%) reported liv-
ing with either their biological father or stepfather. The
degree of the father's involvement ranged from 0 to 3.5,
with a mean of 2.2. A mean of 2.2 reflects moderate lev-
els of positive involvement by the father (eg, sometimes
talking over important decisions with the child, listen-
ing to the child's side of an argument, and the child re-
porting feeling fairly close to the father).
First, 2 unconditional growth curve models were es-
timated for internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The
unconditional growth model estimated that the mean tra-
jectories for child internalizing and externalizing behav-
iors have a nonzero intercept and a nonzero slope (in-
ternalizing: Pintercept
.001, Pslope
.001; externalizing:
Pintercept
.001, Pslope
.001) (data not shown). The vari-
ances around the mean intercept and slope were also sig-
nificant (P.001), indicating that there is notable diver-
sity in children's individual trajectories of problem
behaviors. The slope is the rate of change in problem be-
haviors over time represented by child age at each wave
centered at 4.
Next, separate conditional growth models were con-
structed to examine whether individual changes in child
problem behaviors over time differ by maternal depres-
sive symptoms. A multiplicative interaction term of ma-
ternal depressive symptoms and rate of change was tested.
Covariates such as child's sex, race/ethnicity, maternal
education, maternal age at child birth, number of chil-
dren, poverty status, urban residency, and resident fa-
ther status were included to control for potential con-
founding. The conditional growth curve models estimated
a statistically significant effect of maternal depressive

symptoms that was positively associated with the trajec-
tory of externalizing behavior over time (P=.01) (data
not shown) but not with the trajectory of internalizing
behavior after controlling for confounders.
We next tested the effect modification role of the fa-
ther's positive involvement. Table 2 displays the
means and variances of each parameter estimate from
this analysis. For internalizing behavior, a significant
negative rate of change was obtained (P.001), indicat-
ing that internalizing behaviors decreased during the
study. In contrast, externalizing behaviors remained
stable over time as the rate of change was not statisti-
cally significant. After controlling for the father's posi-
tive involvement and other covariates, maternal depres-
sive symptoms were not associated with the trajectories
of child problem behaviors. A statistically significant in-
dependent effect of the father's positive involvement on
the trajectories of child problem behaviors was found
(Pinternalizing
.001, Pexternalizing
.001). Higher levels of
positive involvement by the father were negatively asso-
ciated with child problem behaviors over time. In addi-
tion, the father's positive involvement significantly
modified the association between maternal depressive
symptoms and trajectories of child problem behaviors
(Pinternalizing
=.02, Pexternalizing
=.008). The Figure illustrates
these findings. The protective effect of the father's posi-
tive involvement was statistically significant for chil-
dren of depressed and nondepressed mothers, and the
effects seem larger for the nondepressed group.
COMMENT
The present study shows that the adverse effects of ma-
ternal depressive symptoms on the trajectories of child
problem behaviors across childhood and early adoles-
cence are negligible after the role of positive paternal in-
volvement is considered. We observed that higher lev-
els of positive involvement by the father were negatively
associated with trajectories of child problem behaviors.
Higher levels of positive involvement by the father also
attenuated the adverse effect of maternal depressive symp-
toms on trajectories of child problem behaviors.
Radke-Yarrow and associates9 reported increases in dis-
ruptive and depressive problems in young children of af-
fectively ill mothers compared with children of control
mothers, but their analysis did not include the father's in-
volvementanddidnotextendbeyond2timepoints,incon-
trasttothemultipleassessmentsofthepresentstudy.When
one parent is depressed, the other parent may attempt to
compensate for the impaired functioning of the depressed
parent,14,20 possibly resulting in better parenting practices

in the home environment.20,23 Therefore, the father's posi-
tive involvement should not be overlooked when evaluat-
ing the effect of maternal depression on child develop-
ment. Previous research43,44 on 2-parent families generally
have found that feelings of closeness between fathers and
childrenwereassociatedwithpositivechildoutcomes,such
aslowlevelsofpsychologicaldistressanddelinquency.Con-
sistent with previous research, we observed that higher lev-
els of positive involvement by the father were associated
with lower levels of child problem behaviors. We also ob-
served that the protective effect of the father's positive in-
volvement was larger for the nondepressed group than for
the depressed group (Figure 1). Having a depressed par-
ent is a marker of risk of living in a family context charac-
terized by considerable disadvantage.45 Children with a de-
pressed parent are at higher risk for chronic stress, family
crises, parental marital conflict, family violence, and pos-
sibly a disturbed second parent.45 This adversity in fami-
lies with a depressed parent may explain the difference in
the protective effect of the father's involvement experi-
enced by the depressed and nondepressed groups in the
present study. Results of the present study have impor-
tantimplicationsforintervention.Promotingincreasedlev-
els of positive involvement from a father may be another
avenue for reducing negative effects on child develop-
ment when a mother displays depressive symptoms.
Previous research46 suggests that childhood problem
behaviors frequently endure over time. The present study
shows stability in externalizing behaviors from child-
hood to earlier adolescence but a decline in internaliz-
ing behaviors. The decline in internalizing behaviors may
reflect true change over time, or it may be a result of pos-
sible measurement error in maternal self-reported child
problem behavior data. This study observed significant
within-subject effects from the growth curve models, im-
plying that levels of problem behavior varied over time
and that the individual trajectory differed from one child
to another. This confirms the need to study individual
change over time when the child is exposed to maternal
depressive symptoms. The conventional population-
average approach assumes the same population mean and
slope in predicting child problem behaviors for all chil-
dren. Present within-individual effects suggest that in-
tervention programs tailored to individuals' specific needs
and backgrounds may be warranted for children with
problem behaviors who are living with a depressed
mother.
Some methodological limitations of this study need
to be considered in interpreting the study findings. The
CES-D scale used in the NLSY79 is not a diagnostic cri-
teria­based assessment tool for clinical depression. More-
over, maternal depressive symptoms were considered only
at baseline. Depressive symptoms often wax and wane
during an individual's lifetime.
Multiple assessments of this exposure are needed to
better understand the effect of maternal depression on
child behaviors over time. The BPI scores used in this
study are not comparable with a Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)47 clini-
cal diagnosis. However, there is evidence that young chil-
dren with higher scores on the behavior scales are more
likely than other children to have persistent behavior prob-
lems, to have Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (Third Edition)48 diagnoses of externalizing dis-
orders in later childhood, and to use mental health ser-
vices later in childhood.49 The present study was also lim-
ited by no independent (beyond the mothers') report of
children's behavior problems. Nonetheless, previous stud-
ies50,51 have found that mothers' reports on emotional and
behavior problems in children were consistent with the
reports of others, including teachers and mental health
professionals.
Past research52 has suggested that depressed moth-
ers' impaired cognition and perceptions may bias their
report and result in higher rates of child problem behav-
iors. Hence, measurement error in child problem behav-
ior is possible. In general, the older the child at expo-
sure, the more likely the child will be resilient to the
adversity of maternal depression because the child will
have developed competencies that prepare him or her for
successful coping.53 The inclusion of children at vary-
ing ages of exposure at baseline may have resulted in an
underestimation of the effect of maternal depression on
child problem behaviors. This investigation was also lim-
ited by a lack of information on potential confounders,

such as domestic violence, genetic data, paternal depres-
sion, and maternal treatment status for depression.
This study also has considerable methodological
strengths, including a large and ethnically diverse sample
and the availability of measures of long-term child and
adolescent outcomes in a continuous context. To our
knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study that in-
corporates multiple assessments of family environment
in studying child problem behaviors. Most previous stud-
ies of child development measured family characteris-
tics at only 1 point in time, assuming that the life cir-
cumstances a child experiences remain constant over time.
In addition, the literature about depressed mothers rarely
considers the fathers' involvement.
In conclusion, the results of this study show that
higher levels of positive involvement by the father
were inversely associated with child problem behav-
iors over time and that the effects of maternal depres-
sive symptoms on child behaviors vary by the level of
the father's positive involvement. Poor maternal men-
tal health has serious implications for the health of
women and for their children. Increased recognition
and treatment of maternal depression is needed. The
protective effect of a father's positive involvement
documented in this study suggests that health care
professionals should encourage the father's increased
positive involvement with his children. When the
father readily compensates for the limitations on the
depressed mother's functioning, the child's risk of
problem behaviors may be reduced.14
