The Burden of Hepatitis C in the United States
W. Ray Kim
According to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 3.9
million of the U.S. civilian population have been infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), of
whom 2.7 million (74%) have chronic infection. Hepatitis C virus infection is most common
among non-Caucasian men, ages 30 to 49 years. Moreover, the prevalence of antibody to
hepatitis C virus in groups not represented in the NHANES sample, such as the homeless or
incarcerated, may be as high as 40%. The age-adjusted death rate for non-A, non-B viral
hepatitis increased from 0.4 to 1.8 deaths per 100,000 persons per year between 1982 and
1999. In 1999, the first year hepatitis C was reported separately, there were 3,759 deaths
attributed to HCV, although this is likely an underestimate. There was a 5-fold increase in
the annual number of patients with HCV who underwent liver transplantation between
1990 and 2000. Currently, more than one third of liver transplant candidates have HCV.
Inpatient care of HCV-related liver disease has also been increasing. In 1998, an estimated
140,000 discharges listed an HCV-related diagnosis, accounting for 2% of discharges from
non-federal acute care hospitals in the United States. The total direct health care cost
associated with HCV is estimated to have exceeded $1 billion in 1998. Future projections
predict a 4-fold increase between 1990 and 2015 in persons at risk of chronic liver disease
(i.e., those with infection for 20 years or longer), suggesting a continued rise in the burden of
HCV in the United States in the foreseeable future. (HEPATOLOGY 2002;36:S30-S34.)
In July 2000, the United States Surgeon General de-
clared that hepatitis C represents a "silent epidemic."
Indeed, hepatitis C is the most common chronic
bloodborne infection in the United States, affecting al-
most 3 million Americans. This review focuses attention
on the disease burden associated with hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection. The term, "disease burden," encom-
passes several aspects of the impact of a disease on the
health of a population, ranging from the frequency of the
disease, as measured by incidence and prevalence, to its
effect on (1) longevity, such as mortality rate and years of
life lost because of premature death; (2) morbidity, in-
cluding impairment in health status and quality of life as
well as the need for health care; and (3) finance, including
direct health care expenditures and indirect costs related
to lost income from premature death or disability.
Prevalence and Incidence of HCV
Disease frequency may be measured either by the pool
of existing cases or by the occurrence of new cases. The
former (prevalence) describes the proportion of the pop-
ulation that has the disease in question at a specific point
in time, whereas the latter (incidence) describes the fre-
quency of occurrence of new cases during a defined time
period.
Prevalence. The most widely quoted data on the
prevalence of HCV in the United States are derived from
the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), a national survey of a representative
sample of noninstitutionalized civilian Americans con-
ducted between 1988 and 1994.1 Of 21,000 people tested
for HCV, 380 (1.8%) carried antibodies against the virus,
of whom 280 (74%) had detectable viral RNA in their
serum. Projecting these numbers to the U.S. population
indicates that 3.9 million Americans (95% CI: 3.1 to 4.8
million) have been infected with HCV, of whom 2.7 mil-
lion (95% CI: 2.4 to 3.0 million) have on-going chronic
infection.
Data from the NHANES survey showed that there was
significant demographic variation in the HCV preva-
lence. It was most common in persons 30 to 49 years of

age; non-Hispanic whites had the lowest prevalence
(1.5%) and non-Hispanic blacks had the highest preva-
lence (3.2%) (Fig. 1). Men were 20% more likely to have
hepatitis C than women.
Although these data may be representative of demo-
graphic variability in the general population, socioeco-
nomic characteristics may also influence the prevalence of
HCV infection. In surveys of emergency medical techni-
cians undertaken in various parts of the country, the se-
roprevalence of HCV was found to range between 1.3%
and 3.2%, comparable to that of the NHANES sample.2
On the other hand, a survey conducted at a Veterans
Affairs outpatient clinic showed that 18% of those
screened (n  1,032) had antibody to hepatitis C virus,3
while in another Veterans Affairs study conducted among
homeless veterans (n  829) the prevalence was 40%.4 A
cross-sectional survey of prison inmates in California
showed that 39% of men (n  6,536) and 54% of women
(n  977) were positive for HCV at the time of entry.5
These are undoubtedly high prevalence rates, but they are
comparable to reports from other parts of the world.6
Incidence. Hepatitis C virus is a reportable infectious
disease in the United States, and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has put mechanisms in place to
capture incident cases of HCV infection. These include
passive surveillance programs such as the National Noti-
fiable Disease Surveillance System and hepatitis-specific
active surveillance programs such as the Sentinel Counties
Study of Acute Viral Hepatitis. Despite these efforts, the
incidence of new HCV infection is very difficult to esti-
mate accurately. This is because many patients with acute
HCV infection are asymptomatic and thus do not present
themselves for diagnosis. Under-reporting by health care
providers of diagnosed cases is also thought to be com-
mon. Furthermore, individuals at high risk of infection
may not have ready access to health care, decreasing the
likelihood of timely diagnosis of newly acquired HCV
infection. Because of these limitations, enumerating re-
ported cases of acute hepatitis C significantly underesti-
mates the true incidence of hepatitis C infection.7
Given these caveats, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention has undertaken mathematical modeling
studies to estimate the past incidence of HCV. The model
indicated that the annual incidence of acute HCV infec-
tion in the United States decreased from an average of
approximately 230,000 new cases per year in the 1980s to
38,000 cases per year in the 1990s.8 The number of per-
sons with transfusion-associated HCV infection de-
creased significantly following the introduction in 1985
of guidelines for selecting safer blood donors. It declined
further with the institution of screening of blood donors
for antibody to hepatitis C virus beginning in 1989 with
the first generation test and the second-generation assay
introduced in July 1992. In addition, safer needle-using
practices among injection drug users facilitated by human
immunodeficiency virus prevention programs are also
thought to have decreased the incidence of HCV infec-
tion.8
It may be expected that the reduction in incident cases
will eventually lead to a decrease in the prevalence of
HCV infection. Indeed, a report based on blood donors
from 5 U.S. blood centers indicates that the prevalence of
HCV infection may already be on a decline.9 Between
1992 and 1996, during which time 1.1 million first-time
blood donors were tested, the prevalence of HCV infec-
tion over the course of this period decreased from 0.6% to
0.4% (P  .01). Among the same blood donors, the prev-
alence of hepatitis B virus infection over the study period
remained unchanged at 0.2%. The anticipated reduction
in the prevalence has been corroborated by a report from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which
projected that, following a peak in the mid-1990s at
slightly above 2.0%, prevalence of HCV infection would
gradually decrease to 1.0% by 2030.10
Although the incidence of HCV infection may be de-
creasing, the prevalence of liver disease caused by HCV is
on the rise. This is because there is a significant lag, often
20 years or longer, between the onset of infection and
clinical manifestation of liver disease. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention projects a 4-fold increase
in the number of persons with long-standing (20 years or
longer) infection between 1990 and 2015.10 However, it
is uncertain whether the projected decline in the HCV
prevalence based on NHANES data (non-institutional-
ized civilians) will translate to a similar decline in other
population groups known to have very high prevalences
of HCV infection, such as active injection drug users and
prison inmates.

virus. (Data from NHANES.1) In all racial groups, people between 30 and
49 years of age had the highest prevalence. Conversely, in all age
groups, people of non-white race had the highest prevalence.

Mortality From HCV Infection
Mortality statistics in the United States are based on
the "underlying cause of death" listed on death certifi-
cates. Deaths attributable to viral hepatitis result pri-
marily from chronic liver disease and liver failure. Con-
sequently, viral hepatitis may not necessarily be listed as
the underlying cause of death. Therefore, it is likely that
the death certificate designation may underestimate the
true incidence of deaths related to viral hepatitis. Further,
until 1999, when the International Classification of Dis-
ease version 10 (ICD-10) began to be used to classify
causes of death, hepatitis C was not given an independent
code, making it difficult to estimate the total number of
deaths attributable to HCV infection.
With these caveats in mind, Fig. 2 describes the num-
ber of deaths and the age-adjusted death rate classified as
death from viral hepatitis (non-A, non-B) between 1982
and 1999. In 1982, 814 deaths were attributed to viral
hepatitis, which increased 6-fold by 1999 to 4,853
deaths.11 There was a corresponding increase in the age-
adjusted death rate from 0.4 to 1.8 deaths per 100,000
persons per year. Based on data from 1999, the first year
hepatitis C was reported separately, the majority (77%;
n  3,759) of these deaths were caused by HCV infec-
tion. Comparing the deaths in the non-HCV portion of
the 1999 data with all viral hepatitis deaths in the early
1980s suggests that the increase in deaths since the late
1980s may be entirely because of hepatitis C.
To estimate the degree of under-reporting of HCV
infection as the underlying cause of death in the mortality
data, the number of in-hospital deaths from liver disease
related to hepatitis C was abstracted from the Healthcare
Utilization Project database. In 1998 there were an esti-
mated 4,500 in-hospital deaths in the United States from
liver disease related to HCV infection.
Morbidity and Health Care Cost From
HCV Infection
Because chronic hepatitis C has a prolonged natural
history, and only a relative minority of those affected re-
quire on-going medical care for their hepatitis, it is diffi-
cult to estimate the magnitude of morbidity at the
population level. Patients with advanced stages of liver
disease may present with portal hypertension and hepatic
decompensation, as manifested by ascites, hepatic en-
cephalopathy, or gastrointestinal bleeding. These compli-
cations generally necessitate inpatient care that may
include liver transplantation. Thus, data on patients re-
ferred for and undergoing orthotopic liver transplanta-
tion for end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular
carcinoma reflect the most severe degree of morbidity
associated with hepatitis C.
In Table 1, the number of liver transplants performed
for recipients with and without HCV infection is shown
for calendar years 1990 through 2000. There was a 5-fold
increase in the number of orthotopic liver transplantation
recipients with hepatitis C. The proportion of recipients
with HCV infection increased from 12% to 37%. There
was a similar increase in the number and proportion of
liver transplant candidates with hepatitis C registered on
the waiting list (Table 2). The United Network for Organ
Sharing reports that as of 2001, there were 9,783 patients
with hepatitis C awaiting a cadaveric liver transplanta-
tion.
The frequency of inpatient care of HCV-related liver
disease has been estimated based on data derived from the
Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Utiliza-
tion Project.12 This database represents a 20% stratified
sample from all non-federal, acute-care hospitals, which

account for approximately 95% of all hospitalizations in
the nation. Because liver disease from hepatitis C may not
be the main reason for all hospitalizations with a hepatitis
C diagnosis, hospitalizations were divided into 3 groups.
These included hospitalizations in which liver disease
from hepatitis C was the primary reason for hospitaliza-
tion, those in which liver disease from hepatitis C was a
secondary reason, and those in which neither hepatitis C
nor liver disease was a primary reason for the hospitaliza-
tion.
The number of hospitalizations in these categories is
shown in Fig. 3. During the 1990s there was a several-fold
increase in the total number of hospitalizations in which
HCV was listed in the discharge diagnosis. In 1998, an
estimated 140,000 discharges listed an HCV diagnosis,
accounting for approximately 2% of all discharges in the
database. Because of the uncertainty of ascertainment of
HCV in the early 1990s, hospitalizations for other
chronic hepatitis (non-A, non-B) were also captured.
Some of the increase over time was because of the lack
of ascertainment of HCV infection in the early 1990s,
because there was a partially corresponding decrease in the
non-A, non-B hepatitis hospitalizations during the same
period. Figure 3 also shows the total charges associated
with these hospitalizations (1998 U.S. dollars). Hospital-
izations were weighted differently according to the hospi-
talization category, including 80% of charges for primary
hospitalizations for hepatitis C, 50% for secondary hos-
pitalizations, and 20% of the remainder. The estimated
total hospital charges for 1998 were in excess of $1 billion.
Population-based data on the morbidity in individuals
with hepatitis C not requiring hospitalization care are not
available at the present time. Health status and quality of
life have largely been measured in patients seen at referral
centers or participating in randomized trials.13-15 These
studies have uniformly shown a significant decrement in
the subjective health and quality of life in patients with
hepatitis C, although the effect of frequently co-existing
morbidities such as chemical dependence or depression is
difficult to assess separately.16 Although persons aware of
the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C scored lower on qual-
ity-of-life scales than did uninfected persons, it is uncer-
tain how much of this decrement is because of the HCV
infection itself or to the awareness of this condition.17
A cost-of-illness study conducted by the American
Gastroenterological Association estimated that there were
317,000 outpatient visits for the treatment of hepatitis C
in the United States in 1998.18 The cost for outpatient
physician services was projected to be $24 million. Dur-
ing the same year, $530 million was spent for the antiviral
treatment of HCV.
Future Research Needs
There is an ongoing, critical need for up-to-date and
accurate information on the prevalence, incidence, health
care costs, mortality, and morbidity of hepatitis C­related
illnesses in the United States. In formulating health care
policies to prioritize health interventions and research and
to allocate resources accordingly, accurate information
about the current and future burden of disease is essential.
Chronic HCV infection is common, affecting nearly 2%
of the general population and a much higher percentage
of people under special circumstances, such as the home-
less and incarcerated. Although the incidence of HCV
infection appears to have decreased, national statistics in-
dicate that morbidity, mortality, and health care utiliza-
tion associated with consequences of long-standing
infection with hepatitis C have increased since the early
1990s.
Focused studies on the incidence and prevalence of
HCV infection and liver disease in specific populations at
risk are needed. While population surveys provide an ac-
curate estimate of the prevalence of HCV infection, a
significant gap exists between the sero-epidemiologic data
and burden of HCV-related liver disease at the popula-
tion level. This is in part because of the long period be-
tween HCV infection and clinically significant liver

namely those in which hepatitis C was the primary reason for the

total charges (1998 U.S. dollars).

disease, as well as our incomplete understanding of the
natural history of HCV infection at the population level.
Most investigations about the extent and natural history
of liver disease associated with hepatitis C have been con-
ducted at academic tertiary centers based on patients re-
ferred with established disease. By contrast, the majority
of the projected 3 million Americans infected with HCV
have not been diagnosed, and their liver disease status
remains unknown. Studies about liver disease in people
with HCV infection in the population at large are neces-
sary to fill this gap in our knowledge. Moreover, system-
atic epidemiologic studies focused on patients not
represented in population-based surveys (e.g., homeless
and incarcerated) are needed.
Finally, continuing studies of hepatitis C in patients
with other comorbidities are needed. A significant pro-
portion of HCV-infected patients have a number of co-
morbid conditions, including poly-substance abuse (e.g.,
alcohol) and mental disorders (e.g., depression and anxi-
ety disorders). It is uncertain the extent to which the mor-
bidity present in people infected with HCV is purely
attributable to HCV infection. Determining the extent of
the contribution of extraneous comorbidity is important,
because in people with comorbid conditions, antiviral
therapy alone is unlikely to be successful in improving the
health of the individual. Comprehensive yet cost-effective
strategies to incorporate treatment for hepatitis C in the
management of patients with substance use remain to be
defined.
