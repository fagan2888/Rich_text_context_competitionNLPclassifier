Introduction
With the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)
2002 and school accountability for students' performance
increasing, more and more students are being "left behind"
in their grade because they are not meeting the prescribed
state and local achievement standards. Research shows that
by ninth grade, 30% to 50% of students have repeated at least
one grade during their school career (Goldberg, 2004;
Jimerson & Kaufman, 2003; Johnson, 2001). Students are
required to show their competence on a test to prove they
have met the standards for their grade. In some instances,
when students are not passing the exit test for their grade,
retention in that grade is often the next step (Brown, 2007).
Historically, studies have shown that grade retention has a
negative effect on students, as opposed to promotion to the
next grade (Jimerson & Kaufman, 2003). Retention can
increase the student's chance of dropping out of high school
and decrease his or her self-esteem (Jimerson, Anderson, &
Whipple, 2002). Therefore, teachers are left in a quandary. If
students are not meeting the standards to pass to the next
grade, what options are in place to meet the needs of these
students? Many teachers are still choosing to retain students,
because it is their only alternative (Witmer, Hoffman, &
Nottis, 2004).
Students with disabilities are required to participate in the
state and district tests. Accommodations can be provided if
they are included in the Individualized Education Program
(IEP) or the 504 Accommodation Plan, and some students
who are unable to take the test are provided with an alternate
assessment. These tests are sometimes considered high
stakes for students with disabilities, because the results may
be used to make decisions about grade-level retention or pro-
motion and graduation from high school (Thurlow &
Johnson, 2000).
Problem Statement
"Increased political pressure on schools to demonstrate stu-
dent achievement has pushed more and more educators to
retain failing students in order to implement stricter promo-
tion standards" (Ownings & Kaplan, 2001, p. 9). Research
has shown that retention and social promotion are ineffec-
tive solutions for struggling learners (Bowman, 2005; Byrd
& Weitzman, 1994; Jimerson, 2001). Social promotion is
the practice of keeping students who fail with their age
group, because of the social-emotional impact of retention.

Grade Retention: Elementary Teacher's
Perceptions for Students With and
Without Disabilities
Gia A. Renaud1
Abstract
Academic accountability is of great concern, therefore grade retention is being considered for both students with and
without disabilities who are not meeting end-of-the-year achievement benchmarks. The purpose of this study was to
investigate teacher attitudes toward grade retention and whether practices differ when recommending retention of students
with or without disabilities. This mixed-methods study utilized a paper-and-pencil questionnaire using a Likert-type scale,
as well as two open-ended questions and a checklist. Teacher interviews were also conducted. The findings of this study
indicate that teachers are considering a multitude of factors when considering grade retention for their struggling students.
Academic performance was the factor that teachers (77%) indicated the most frequently. Although teachers felt pressure
and accountability from high stakes testing, they felt test results should be one of many factors considered in the retention
decision.

Research suggests many alternatives to retention such as,
early intervention programs as well as summer and after-
school programs (Lincove & Painter, 2006). Professional
development and effective early reading instruction are
also alternatives suggested in the literature to prevent reten-
tion (Bowman, 2005; Lincove & Painter, 2006). However,
these alternatives require funding and are not always pos-
sible in school systems where budgets are being reduced.
School systems that have declining budgets are still forced
to retain some struggling learners due to lack of alterna-
tives. From a budgetary standpoint, retention might be
short sighted. Retaining a student increases the educational
cost for that student by 8% (Bali, Anagnostopoulos, &
Roberts, 2005).
Students with disabilities are often being retained as a
result of their performance on state testing (Katsiyannis,
Zhang, Ryan, & Jones, 2007). The school department's
expectation is that with an extra year of education, the stu-
dents with disabilities will improve their performance on the
high stakes tests. This is a concern for educators because stu-
dents with disabilities who perform poorly on the state tests
may make the school look less effective when the test scores
are published. Therefore, this can have a negative effect on
teacher attitudes toward students with disabilities (Katsiyannis
et al., 2007). It has been found that dropping out of school has
increased for students who are retained, and it also has been
proven that students with disabilities in special education pro-
grams are dropping out of high school at a higher rate than
their peers who do not have IEPs (Thurlow & Johnson, 2000).
Nationally, 41% of students with disabilities are dropping out
of high school (Reschly & Christenson, 2006).
Teacher attitudes about retention do not necessarily reflect
the research. In a study of teacher attitudes about retention, it
was concluded that most teachers believe that grade retention
between kindergarten and fourth grade is beneficial for the
child (Witmer et al., 2004). Both students with disabilities as
well as students without disabilities are sometimes held back
a grade to improve their scores on a high stakes test (Thurlow
& Johnson, 2000). Teachers are either not informed of the
research regarding grade retention or choosing to go by their
own professional opinions. The hypothesis for this study is
that teachers are retaining students with disabilities due to
the pressures associated with passing the high stakes testing
in the upcoming years.
Background of the Study
History of Grade Retention
In 1983, A Nation at Risk was published, and it presented a
dismal picture of American education. It was a call to action
that education reform was needed in the United States. A
Nation at Risk called for expanding graduation requirements,
minimum competency tests, and establishing higher aca-
demic standards (Hayes, 2004; Vinovskis, 2009).
A Nation at Risk recommended that our schools needed
more rigorous and measurable standards. This implied schools
needed to become more accountable in the areas of student
achievement. The preferred method of determining the level
of accountability has become "high stakes testing." High
stakes testing has been introduced to ensure that curriculum
standards are being effectively and efficiently taught. High
stakes tests can determine whether a student passes to the next
grade or receives a high school diploma. The introduction of
new examinations at every level is one of the most controver-
sial and lasting reforms from this report (Hayes, 2004).
High Stakes Testing
Accountability for schools was an essential part of this
reform movement and therefore, high stakes testing was
developed. Reform leaders wanted to make schools account-
able for implementing curriculum standards. The most effi-
cient and obvious measure of student learning was to develop
tests. Every state needed to ensure that the curriculum aligned
with its state achievement standards was being taught effec-
tively and efficiently. In order for these tests to be taken seri-
ously, leaders felt they needed the results to be meaningful to
both students and school personnel (Hayes, 2004).
Consequently, to ensure that the tests would be taken ear-
nestly, the results of tests were not only available to the
school district; they were going to be disseminated to the
public. Therefore, these tests needed to affect issues that
were important to both students and school personnel such as
grades, being promoted to the next level, and high school
graduation. With the onset of these tests, many states
increased their high school graduation requirement. Students
would not be able to graduate from high school without pass-
ing the required test (Hayes, 2004).
NCLB 2001 requires accountability of schools and school
districts for student performance. Students in Grades 3
through 8 and once in high school must be tested annually in
reading and math. Schools are expected to demonstrate that
they are making "adequate yearly progress" (Hayes, 2004).
Some feel that NCLB requires that students who are not
reading by third grade be retained. This retention would be
for students who are not meeting end-of-the-year grade-level
expectations (Lazarus & Ortega, 2007). Although no such
requirement is in the law, since the passage of NCLB, the
number of students being retained has increased due to the
emphasis on accountability (Jimerson et al., 2006). Schnurr,
Kundert, and Nickerson (2009) suggested,
With the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Legislation
(2001), grade retention is again at the forefront of education and
political debate. It continues to be a widely accepted intervention
for struggling students, retention has been revealed to be not
only an ineffective and costly intervention with detrimental
long-term consequences, but it has limited the discussion of
effective alternatives for students at risk. (p. 417)
Renaud 3
With the enactment of these mandates that hold educators
accountable for student performance, there has been an
increase in high stakes testing. Although the accountability
requirement was intended for schools and educators, these
high stakes tests impact the students more than the educa-
tors. High stakes testing can affect a student's course and
grade assignment, and whether or not the student is pro-
moted to the next grade. Testing results may also determine
whether or not the student receives a high school diploma
(Vinovskis, 2009).
Grade Retention and Social Promotion
Grade retention is the practice of keeping students in their
present grade because they have not mastered the skills nec-
essary to progress to the next grade. Social promotion is the
practice of keeping students who fail with their age group,
because of the social-emotional impact of retention. President
William Jefferson Clinton called for an end to social promo-
tion in his last three State of the Union addresses. President
Clinton stated that a child should not move onto the next
grade "until they are ready" (Ownings & Kaplan, 2001).
"Because there are often short-term gains, many educational
professionals view retention as a success because they do not
see the later difficulties that the large majority of retainees
experience" (Schnurr et al., 2009, p. 416).
As our nation has pushed for higher academic standards
in our schools, school districts have established minimum
promotion and graduation standards. Therefore, grade reten-
tion has emerged as a vehicle for enforcing the standard
driven academic system (Randolph, Fraser, & Orthner,
2004). High stakes testing has decreased the frequency of
social promotion and increased the frequency of grade reten-
tion (Roderick & Nagaoka, 2005). The idea of grade reten-
tion is that it will offer students more time for learning.
However, typically the instructional methods do not change
and the year of retention is just a repeat of what occurred in
the previous year (Bonvin, Bless, & Schuepbach, 2008).
Jimerson (1999) found low-achieving students who were
promoted displayed higher academic achievement in 11th
grade. These promoted students were also less likely to drop
out and more likely to receive a diploma or General Education
Development (GED). This study suggests that grade reten-
tion and social promotion are not beneficial in either situa-
tion. Educators need to seek alternative intervention
strategies that will enhance educational outcomes and pro-
vide effective research-based interventions addressing both
academic and emotional needs (Jimerson, 1999).
Who Is Being Retained?
Demographics often are predictors of retention. It has been
shown that African American children, poor children, and
boys are more likely to be retained (Frey, 2005). Research
has also revealed that minority students who have teachers of
the same race are less likely to be retained (Bali et al., 2005).
Predictors for early grade retention were looked at by Byrd
and Weitzman (1994). This study concluded that several fac-
tors can influence early school failure such as being raised in
poverty, low maternal education, or where one or more bio-
logical parents were absent. Finances, of course, come into
play because retention is costly. School districts with sub-
stantial revenue and larger districts are more likely to retain
students, because costs may not be as evident. Larger dis-
tricts have a smaller per student expenditure; therefore, the
cost of retention is less (Bali et al., 2005). Consequently, a
child's race, socioeconomic status, and family, and where the
child lives can affect whether or not a child is retained.
Retention and Teacher Attitudes
Teacher attitudes toward retention were examined in a study
conducted by Witmer et al. (2004), and it was found that
teachers were not necessarily familiar with the research on
retention. Most teachers felt that, if a child were retained in
the years between kindergarten and fourth grade, it would be
beneficial. Teachers' felt that retention would improve a
child's school success and self-esteem. This study concluded
that there is a need to educate the people who are making
decisions about retention, about the research, and implica-
tions for students. "Overall, teachers described their knowl-
edge of retention research as limited. The majority attributed
their knowledge to personal experiences with retained stu-
dents" (Witmer et al., 2004, p. 186).
Retention and Drop-Out Rates
The research studying grade retention and dropping out of
high school is not quite clear. A review of the literature has
shown that grade retention is the strongest predictor of high
school drop-out status. Jimerson et al. (2002) indicated that
the research also shows students who have been retained in
two grades are 90% more likely to drop out of high school.
Jimerson et al. suggested,
An emphasis on accountability and standards has let to political
pressures upon schools nationwide in evaluating their
effectiveness and overall success by test scores. Of grave
concern is that this unprecedented pressure has led to increased
retention rates in order for schools to demonstrate a commitment
to standards, rather than consideration of the long-term beneficial
outcomes for students, particularly given that retention is
strongly associated with high school dropout. (p. 454)
However, when Chicago instituted an eighth-grade pro-
motional standard requirement, drop-out rates did not
increase. Therefore, this study concluded that retention as a
result of poor performance on high stakes testing does not
have the same effects on retention as teacher initiated reten-
tion (Allensworth, 2005).
4 SAGE Open
In a study of students with mild disabilities, grade retention was
found to be a "powerful predictor" of dropping out of high
school. For students with disabilities, not being retained was
associated with a 73% reduction in the odds of dropping out of
school. Students with a disability who dropout are less likely to
earn a General Education Development (GED) diploma or go to
a post secondary school than their peers without a disability.
Therefore, it is imperative that students with disabilities continue
in school and be supported so they can graduate. (Reschly &
Christenson, 2006, p. 277)
Retention and Test Scores
In 1996, Chicago Public schools called for an end to social
promotion and had promotion testing requirements for third,
sixth, and eighth grade. This study examined whether reten-
tion leads to higher achievement for retained students, than if
they had been promoted to the next grade. The results showed
that retained students had a very limited improvement in
their academic performance the year after the grade retention
and no substantial effects were noted 2 years later. It con-
cluded that students did not succeed in their 2nd year, because
they were taught with the same approach. This study also
found that retaining students increased the likelihood of
placement in special education. Another implication of this
study is that teaching techniques need to be examined before
a child is retained. Sometimes a student is struggling due to
the teaching approach not due to his or her ability to learn
(Roderick & Nagaoka, 2005).
Jimerson conducted a meta-analysis of grade retention
research in 2001. As a result of this review, it was concluded
that neither grade retention nor social promotion in itself will
provide the support a child needs for success. Educators need
to implement research-proven remedial strategies. Jimerson
suggests that school psychologists are in a role to help school
systems explore new programs to help these at-risk students
be successful in school (Jimerson, 2001).
NCLB
With the implementation of NCLB, many educators feared it
would increase grade retention. However, the only grades
that saw an increase in grade retention were kindergarten and
first grade. It was actually discovered that students' retention
was more equitable. The link between low socioeconomic
level and the likelihood of being retained decreased. One
possible reason for this decline is that educators are basing
retention decisions on more objective measures such as test
scores rather than teacher judgment (Viadero, 2007). Due to
the requirements of the NCLB and the Individuals With
Disabilities Education Act 2004 (IDEA), an increasing num-
ber of students with disabilities are being included in high
stakes tests. All students are being held accountable to profi-
ciency standards and all assessment scores are being reported
(Albrecht & Joles, 2003). Students with disabilities are given
accommodations according to their IEP, and a small percent-
age of students are given an alternate assessment. However,
these accommodations are often inadequate because the tests
are not always appropriate for students with disabilities
(Meek, 2006). Quite often if students do not pass the test,
they are not permitted to go to the next grade (Meek, 2006;
Schulte, Villwock, Whichard, & Stallings, 2001). Therefore,
students with disabilities might be retained due to an inap-
propriate test.
"As schools face increased pressure to raise test scores,
students who are on the verge of passing the test may receive
the greatest attention and support, whereas other students
with greater needs want for help" (Larsen & Akmal, 2007, p.
47). Therefore, some students are being retained because
school districts are putting their time and money into stu-
dents who can pass the high stakes test. In 2003, retention
rates for low-income students increased. Frederick and
Hauser (2008) attributed this rise to NCLB which was passed
in 2002. Some policy makers believe that by having stricter
promotion requirements, the number of students meeting
these higher grade-level standards will increase. Their belief
is that these higher standards and fear of retention will moti-
vate students to work harder (David, 2008).
Many educators are concerned that the pressure from the
high stakes tests are increasing grade retention and changing
the curriculum. Students are being forced to learn the content
of the tests and the curriculum is being narrowed to what is
going to be on the test. Paper-and-pencil tests are not the only
measure of a student's knowledge. Many students are able to
express themselves creatively and these high stakes test do
not allow it. It seems that standardized tests should only be
one measure in a portfolio to decide if a child is able to be
promoted to the next grade (Neill, 2006).
Accountability and high stakes testing has raised the stan-
dards for all students, including those with disabilities. IDEA
and NCLB have led to increased provision of accommoda-
tions so that students can demonstrate their knowledge on
these large-scale assessments. Parents of students with dis-
abilities are more aware of their rights and are asking for
their students to be included in this more rigorous curricu-
lum. Students are given greater access to the general educa-
tion curriculum through enhanced awareness of appropriate
accommodations to access the curriculum. Therefore, with
higher expectations for all, more students are reaching higher
academic goals (Ysseldyke et al., 2004).
End of Year Testing
In 1996, Chicago Public schools called for an end to social
promotion and had promotion testing requirements for third,
sixth and eighth grade. Students were retained if they did not
pass the end-of-the-year test. The results shows that retained
students had a very limited boost in their academic perfor-
mance the year after the grade retention, and no substantial
effects were noted 2 years later. It concluded that students
Renaud 5
did not succeed in their 2nd year, because they were taught
with the same approach. Teachers need support to diagnose
the problem that the student is having and then design effec-
tive strategies to support these struggling learners.
This study also found that retaining students increased the
likelihood of placement in special education. During the
retention year, students were often diagnosed with a learning
disability. The researchers suggest that some students may be
mislabeled as learning disabled because the special educa-
tion status will help them to progress to the next grade with-
out meeting all of the requirements. Therefore, special
education is being used as a vehicle to circumvent the end-
of-year testing policy (Roderick & Nagaoka, 2005).
Similarly, the reading scores of retained students were
compared with a group of randomly selected students who
had not retained. The retained students' scores were com-
pared for growth rates between the initial year and the
repeated year. Then their scores were compared with a match
group of promoted students. This analysis showed that the
retained students did not show a significant increase or
decrease in reading scores in the 2nd year of that grade. The
promoted students showed significantly more growth overall
than the retained students. This study concludes that as reten-
tion is a costly venture and the benefits do not outweigh the
positive intent, other types of interventions should be exam-
ined (Silberglitt, Jimerson, Appleton, & Burns, 2006).
In 2003, Texas required third graders to receive a mini-
mum score on its state-mandated reading test to be promoted
to fourth grade. In addition, in 2005, fifth graders had to meet
a minimum score on both a reading and math test to be pro-
moted to sixth grade. Lorence and Dworkin (2006) followed
students who failed third grade in May 1994 in Texas and
repeated third grade until these students were in tenth grade.
This study concluded that after repeating third grade, the
reading scores of the students who had been retained
remained consistent with the scores of socially promoted stu-
dents. However, as the years progressed, the students who
were retained in third grade surpassed their peers who had
been socially promoted. Many of the students who were
socially promoted took an extra year to pass the state reading
test whereas the students who were retained passed on time.
In a study of how standards-based reform affected teacher
quality, it was found that administrators were reducing class
size and putting more experienced teachers in the grades that
were being tested (Viadero, 2007). In Florida, third-grade
students were being retained because they failed the state
high stakes assessment (Florida Comprehensive Assessment
Test [FCAT]). In some schools, second graders were being
retained because school personnel believed that these stu-
dents would not be able to pass the test in third grade (Lazarus
& Ortega, 2007). In 2003, 6,000 students were required to
repeat third grade after failing to meet the state's end-of-
grade standard. Therefore, it was decided that school person-
nel could override the test scores after reviewing student
work and other factors (Goldberg, 2004). The decision of
grade retention is an important one and should be made by
examining multiple assessments and several sources of evi-
dence (Thompson & Cunningham, 2000).
Due to the requirements of NCLB and IDEA, an increas-
ing number of students with disabilities are being included in
high stakes tests. Students are provided testing accommoda-
tions and a small percentage of students participate in an
alternate assessment. However, these accommodations are
often inadequate because the tests are not always appropriate
for students with disabilities (Meek, 2006). Therefore, if stu-
dents do not pass the test, they are not permitted to go to the
next grade although the test was not a proper measure of their
ability (Meek, 2006; Schulte et al., 2001).
Alternatives to Retention
The review of the literature consistently agrees that there
should be an end to social promotion and grade retention.
Educators need to focus on implementing teaching practices
that will prevent academic failure. However, the literature
offers suggestions of alternatives and concedes that deciding
which is right for a school system will be a difficult endeavor.
Included among the suggestions for alternatives to grade
retention are several studies suggesting that one way to pre-
vent early school failure is to develop preschool intervention
programs. These programs would target at-risk children and
assist them in developing the social and cognitive skills neces-
sary for early success in school. Head Start programs have
been doing this successfully for several decades (Barnett &
Hustedt, 2005). It has been proven that targeting these skills at
an early age can prevent retention (Lincove & Painter, 2006).
Effective early reading programs are also indicated in the
literature as an effective way to prevent retention. Reading is
an essential skill for success in school; therefore, all children
need to learn to read in the early grades. Reading instruction
needs to be structured and teachers need to be trained in the
most effective programs for their population (Lincove &
Painter, 2006).
Summer school and afterschool programs will provide
many students with additional opportunities for instructional
support. The literature is clear that programs that focus on
effective teaching and offer remedial intervention programs
improve student achievement. Hence, students with this
additional support either after school or during the summer
are less likely to drop out of school due to repeating a grade
(Lincove & Painter, 2006).
Professional development for teachers is critical if grade
retention is going to be eliminated. Teachers need to be
trained in teaching strategies which will improve learning for
all students. Training in assessment techniques that drive
instruction, as well as monitoring student's progress while
they are being taught, will help teachers to teach effectively.
Districts need to set clear policies on retention and promo-
tion as well giving teachers the training that is necessary to
provide effective instruction (Bowman, 2005).

Conclusion
Research has shown that retention and social promotion are
not viable solutions for struggling students. Research has
identified students who are more likely to be retained and
those who need more support in their academic career.
Nonetheless, with increased political pressure to establish
achievement standards for students and school accountabil-
ity for students' performance, school systems are under
scrutiny. Schools are expected to improve student achieve-
ment and test scores and provide appropriate supports and
services for struggling learners. Teachers and administra-
tors are often making these retention decisions without
knowledge of the research and quite often there are not
many supports available for their struggling students due to
budget constraints.
The literature provides many suggestions for alternatives
to retention. However, these alternatives can be costly, which
may limit the options considered by districts. Several factors
may influence the decision: the population to be served, the
resources available to support such programs, state and local
testing requirements, and the training for teachers. The chal-
lenge is that student populations vary in each and every
classroom; yet the teacher needs to be effective for all the
children in the class. Districts need to determine how train-
ing and support can be provided effectively and efficiently
through this difficult process.
Although the research is clear on the ineffectiveness of
retention and the need for alternatives, teachers continue to
retain both students with and without disabilities. Therefore,
there is a need to examine why teachers are making these
retention decisions and what factors need to change in order
for the struggling students to receive support without adding
another year of education.
Research Questions
The research questions guiding this study were as follows:
Research Question 1: Are there differences in elementary
teachers' decision-making process regarding retention
for students with and without disabilities?
Research Question 2: What factors influence elementary
teachers' decision-making process about retaining stu-
dents with and without disabilities?
Research Question 3: How does student performance on
state testing affect elementary teachers' decision-mak-
ing process about retaining students with and without
disabilities?
Research Design
This study used a concurrent triangulation, mixed method in
which elementary teachers responded to a questionnaire and
then selected teachers were interviewed. This two-phase
study began with collecting quantitative data from the ques-
tionnaire at three different elementary schools in an urban
school district (Creswell & Clark, 2007). The survey of N =
74 teachers was cross-sectional because all the data were col-
lected at one time (Creswell, 2003). Following the gathering
of data from the questionnaire, n = 9 teacher interviews were
scheduled and conducted.
Sample
The sample for this study consists of N = 74 teachers from n
= 3 elementary schools in an urban school district in
Southeastern Massachusetts. This district has n = 9 elemen-
tary schools. The researcher attended faculty meetings for
these n = 3 schools to distribute and collect the question-
naires at the meetings. Teachers who completed the ques-
tionnaire were asked to volunteer to be interviewed at a
future date and time. The researcher selected teachers from
different grade levels at each school as well as two special
education teachers. The researcher interviewed n = 9 teach-
ers from the three elementary schools during the teacher's
preparation period.
Instrumentation
The paper-and-pencil instrument designed by the researcher
contained 24 items requiring responses using a Likert-type
scale (Appendix A). The response scale ranged from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and it included two
open-ended questions and a checklist. For each question,
teachers were asked to respond how they perceived each
question for both regular education students as well as stu-
dents with disabilities. For the purpose of this study, stu-
dents with disabilities were defined as any student with an
IEP or a 504 Accommodation Plan. The principals allowed
time at the meeting for the researcher to explain the survey
and for the teachers to complete it. The instrument was con-
structed from a review of the literature and the judgmental
review by n = 3 elementary teachers to increase content
validity (Beck & Gable, 2001). A consent form was attached
to the questionnaire and with its completion, the teachers
consented to participate.
The instrument was piloted with a group of n=3 elemen-
tary teachers who were not involved in the study. The qual-
itative data were compiled by the researcher from the
interviews with the elementary school teachers. The inter-
view questions were determined from the review of the
literature and the open-ended questions in the question-
naire (Appendix B). The interviewer asked questions that
were designed to evoke vivid descriptions and anecdotes.
Follow-up questions were designed to provide nuanced
answers that provided more precise descriptions and refine
the understandings. Richness of ideas and themes was
encouraged by asking the interviewee to elaborate on their
answers.
Renaud 7
The researcher utilized Rubin and Rubin's (2005)
responsive interviewing technique to obtain a deeper under-
standing of the perceptions of the teachers being inter-
viewed. The interviewer used a predetermined set of
questions but allowed the interviewee to digress into topics
relevant to the study. The interviews were structured, so
that the data were detailed, vivid, and rich with thematic
material (Rubin & Rubin, 2005). Throughout the interview
process, the researcher made an audit trail to ensure a chain
of evidence linking the research questions and the data
(Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2007). The interviews were audiotaped
with the participants' permission. Participants also con-
sented to the interviews being transcribed as well for any
future use for presentations.
Data Collection
The researcher was able to attend faculty meetings at the
three schools. This gave the researcher time to explain the
survey instrument and interview process. The teachers were
given time to complete the surveys at the meeting and the
researcher was able to collect the survey and interview vol-
unteer information. When the survey instrument was
administered, there was a separate sheet for teachers to use
if they were interested in being interviewed at a later date.
Teachers who volunteered to be interviewed placed the
sheet in a separate collection box; therefore, there was not
a process to connect the individual teacher with his or her
survey instrument.
After the survey data had been collected, the responses
to the open-ended questions were reviewed to see if supple-
mentary questions needed to be added to the interview pro-
tocol. The interviews were conducted in a face-to-face
manner and enabled the participants to give historical infor-
mation about children whom they had retained and how
their decisions had been made as to whether or not to retain
a child as well as what factors they consider when retaining
a child.
An interview protocol was used to guide the interviewer.
The interviewer took notes and also audiotaped the inter-
view with the permission of the participants (Creswell,
2003). The interview questions for teachers included ques-
tions about the benefits of retention and what factors influ-
enced their decisions to retain a student. Teachers were first
asked to sign a consent form giving the researcher permis-
sion to use the information provided in the interview. The
interviewer asked open-ended questions and audiotaped the
interviews with the participant's permission. Finally, the
researcher gathered the data and analyzed them for themes.
Subsequently, the researcher transcribed the interviews and
sent the transcript to the participants. Member checking was
utilized by the researcher sending the transcript to the inter-
viewees by email for their review to determine the accuracy
of the findings (Creswell, 2003).
Data Analysis
For the first research question, quantitative data were
extracted from the questionnaire by using descriptive statis-
tics (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard devia-
tions) where appropriate. A paired t test was used to compare
the differences between the means of responses of teachers
when considering retention for students with and without
disabilities. Qualitative data from the open-ended questions
on the survey as well as an interview question were also uti-
lized in this analysis. The second research question data were
gathered from survey questions, a checklist on the survey,
and some of the interview questions. The last research ques-
tion used qualitative data from an open-ended question on
the survey and interview questions. However, there were
four quantitative questions on the survey regarding this topic.
The purpose of the concurrent triangulation strategy was
to confirm or corroborate the finding with this mixed-meth-
ods study (Creswell, 2003). Therefore, once the quantitative
and qualitative data were analyzed, the researcher merged
the two sets of data. Both data sets were looked at equally
and the findings were compared and synthesized (Creswell
& Clark, 2007). The reports of the findings were sent to all of
the principals involved in this study as well as the superin-
tendent of the district.
Findings
Research Question 1: Are there differences in elementary
teachers' decision-making process regarding retention
for students with and without disabilities?
Academic Performance
There were two items on the survey with the largest effect
sizes for the t statistic (Appendix C). The first item was "I am
more likely to retain a student than send him or her to the
next grade without the necessary skills." This item was more
significant for special education students. Lorence and
Dworkin (2006) indicated in their study that special educa-
tion students were more likely to be socially promoted
because they were not required to meet the grade-level
benchmarks. The teachers in this study expressed just the
opposite view. Based on their survey responses, the teachers
were more likely to retain a student with a disability than a
regular education student who does not have the necessary
skills to go to the next grade. The literature also cites aca-
demic performance as the most important factor teachers
consider when making decisions regarding grade retention
and this study found similar findings (Witmer et al., 2004).
Two other items that showed a statistical trend were "I
retain students because I am worried they will fail the next
grade" and "I retain students who are failing two major sub-
jects" (Appendix C). These items were found to be more
8 SAGE Open
significant for regular education students. These two items
reflect concerns about academic performance which has
been reported in the literature as the most important factor
when teachers are making a decision regarding grade reten-
tion (Bonvin et al., 2008; Witmer et al., 2004). Therefore,
teachers in this study considered academic performance a
concern for both students with and without disabilities.
Retention More Effective in Grades K-2
The second item was "I believe retention is more effective in
the earlier grades (K-2)," which had an effect size of .41
(Appendix C). This item was more significant for regular
education students. The belief that grade retention is better
for students in earlier grades is evident in the literature on
grade retention (Witmer et al., 2004). This belief is also evi-
dent in the results of this survey in particular for regular edu-
cation students.
Positive Retention in the Past
One item that showed a statistical trend was "I have retained
students who have been very successful in future years of
school" and was found to be more significant for regular
education students (Appendix C). Larsen and Akmal (2007)
found that although teachers knew the research on grade
retention stated it was generally not effective, most teachers
could remember a specific case where it seemed to be benefi-
cial. Therefore, they continue to hold on the feeling that for
some children, the retention might work. Jimerson (1999)
indicated that teachers feel grade retention is successful
because they see success in 1 or 2 years following the reten-
tion. However, teachers typically do not follow the student
through high school. A similar finding in this study emerged
during an interview, when a fourth-grade teacher commented
on a former student whom she had retained, and had a posi-
tive experience:
A couple of years ago I retained a student in fourth grade. The
child was immature. Teachers had been passing him on because
he was nice. I fought to hold him back because I thought it
would be beneficial. It was successful. The second year he
received B's and C's. In fifth grade, he was a B student. His
mom said it was the best thing that ever happened. She thanked
me and said she was asking for him to be retained since
kindergarten.
Remedial Support
The last item that showed a trend in the teachers' ratings was
"I am more likely to retain a student who does not receive
any remedial support" (Appendix C). This item was also
found to be more noteworthy for regular education students.
It seems obvious that this would be more significant for reg-
ular education students because students with disabilities are
already receiving remedial support. A third-grade teacher
commented during her interview, "I am more apt to send a
child on if I know they are going to get support in the follow-
ing grade." A first-grade teacher commented, "We need more
services and support as opposed to grade retention." Lincove
and Painter (2006) indicated the need for appropriate instruc-
tion to meet individual student's need as an alternative to
grade retention. Jimerson (2001) indicated in his meta-anal-
ysis that the need for additional remediation strategies and
support to facilitate educational success for all students was
a common theme in the literature on grade retention.
Research Question 2: What factors influence elementary
teachers' decision-making process about retaining stu-
dents with and without disabilities?
Academic Performance
According to the totals, 77% of respondents indicated on the
checklist that academic performance influenced their deci-
sion-making process regarding grade retention, making this
factor the most frequently cited (Appendix D). This concurs
with Witmer et al. (2004) in their study of teacher's beliefs
and knowledge about grade retention, which found that aca-
demic performance was considered twice as important as the
second most important factor (ability). Witmer et al. also
found effort and maturity to be significant factors. The least
cited factors in this study were summer birthdays and self-
esteem with only 10% of respondents indicating that they
considered these factors in their decision making. During the
interviews, 89% of the teachers cited academic performance
as a factor they consider when retaining a student.
Maturity
The participant's choices by the number of years they have
been teaching indicate that respondents who have been
teaching for fewer years (0-20 years) considered a child's
maturity more than teachers those who have been teaching
for a longer period of time (21-40 years;Appendix E). During
the interview, a teacher who had been teaching for 12 years
commented, "The biggest factor is maturity. Can the child
maintain focus? Can the child do work that is well thought
out and well done?" A teacher who has been teaching for 27
years commented, "Maturity plays a part in my decision but
not a big one." When responses were organized by grade-
level taught, teachers who taught kindergarten through sec-
ond grade (72%) indicated that they considered maturity
when making a decision regarding grade retention more than
teachers who taught Grades 3 to 5 (60%) and coaches (38%).
Maturity is cited in the research as an area that teachers look
at in kindergarten and first grade to determine whether a
child should repeat a grade, be placed in a transition room, or
delay entry into school (Byrd & Weitzman, 1994; Gay, 2002;
Graue & DiPerna, 2000).
Renaud 9
High Stakes Testing
High stakes testing was indicated most by Grades 3 to 5
teachers (23%) while only 9% of K-2 teachers indicated it
was a factor and none of the coaches (Appendix F). As the
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS)
begins in Grade 3, it would be logical that Grades 3 to 5
teachers would be feeling the most pressure in elementary
schools. Vinovskis (2009) discussed the pressure that educa-
tors feel as a result from high stakes testing and how it affects
their decision making in regard to grade retention.
Parental Support
Most of the teachers interviewed felt parental support was
very important. Several teachers responded that they were
less apt to retain if parents were willing to get involved and
support academics at home or get tutoring. A second-grade
teacher commented, "If parents support retention, then it is
easier to retain. Some parent's will help you and write a
letter in support of retention. If parents fight you then I
don't push for retention." Parental support is cited in the
research as an important component to student success
(Jimerson et al., 2006).
Social and Emotional Concerns
Social and emotional concerns were also noted. The majority
of teachers felt retention was better if it was done in the ear-
lier grades where it did not have a big social stigma. A first-
grade teacher expressed concern that, "When a child is
retained, he or she sees it as a punishment." This concurs
with Byrnes and Yamamoto's (2001) finding that nonpromo-
tion is considered a punishment for one's inability to suc-
ceed. The teachers expressed concern that as students get
older, the other students in the class can be mean. A special
needs teacher who expressed concern that repeating in an
upper grade can be negative commented, "It is also negative
to sit in a class that is too difficult. Then the child might
become a behavior problem."
Special Education Teachers
Consider a Multitude of Factors
When examining the responses by the role that teacher has in
the school, the results illustrate that special education teach-
ers were likely to indicate more factors for retention as compared
with regular education teachers and coaches (Appendix D). The
n = 5 teachers who were interviewed and had a special edu-
cation background considered a multitude of factors when
retaining a student. These data suggest that special educators
are examining more factors than regular education teachers
and coaches when making a decision about retention. During
an interview, a fifth-grade special education teacher com-
mented, "You need to look at the whole child, both academic
and social. There may be a student who struggles with aca-
demics but should not repeat because it is socially detrimen-
tal." The opinions of these teachers are consistent with the
research that decisions about students placements should be
from a variety of indicators of which high stakes testing is
one (Neill, 2006).
Research Question 3: How does student performance on
state testing affect elementary teachers' decision-mak-
ing process about retaining students with and without
disabilities?
High Stakes Testing--One Factor
of Many That Are Considered
Teachers clearly expressed concern about the pressure and
accountability they felt from the MCAS as well as the con-
cern that students need to pass the high school test to gradu-
ate. Some teachers indicated that the MCAS data are released
too late to make retention decisions and that MCAS has
changed their teaching, not their grade retention decisions.
When asked about MCAS, one regular education teacher
responded, "I worry more about the student not having the
skills. They will need to pass MCAS--so I now consider
retention, when before I did not worry much." The literature
on grade retention indicates that the focus on accountability
and test scores has put more of a focus on grade retention
(Larsen & Akmal, 2007).
The first interview question was "What do you perceive
the relationship between grade retention and high stakes test-
ing to be"? The teachers interviewed felt that grade retention
should be looked at on a case by case manner and it should
be a team decision. It was felt that high stakes testing should
be one item among many that are considered when making
this decision which is consistent with the literature (Neill,
2006). Some of the kindergarten, first-, and second-grade
teachers expressed concern regarding pressure from the
upper grade teachers to retain some struggling students. The
teachers said the upper grade teachers complain to the lower
grade teachers that certain students are not ready to take the
test. A first-grade teacher responded, "Some people feel if a
student is kept back a year then they will be more mature for
the MCAS in third, fourth, or fifth grade. They think they
will be able to sit longer for the test." This teacher went on to
say that she did not feel retention will always improve test
scores and that we need to look at the underlying reason why
the child is struggling. Jimerson (2001) reiterated that reme-
dial strategies are more effective than grade retention and
social promotion.
Discussion and Conclusion
The practices of grade retention and social promotion have
been debated for decades. The research indicates that the
benefits of grade retention are limited and most students
10 SAGE Open
profit from being promoted to the next grade with academic
support (Jimerson, 2001). However, with the onset of high
stakes testing and greater accountability for schools, grade
retention has become an issue again. Teachers are feeling
the pressure to meet the end-of-the year requirements for
both students with and without disabilities (Larsen &Akmal,
2007).
When comparing their perceptions regarding regular edu-
cation students and special education students, teachers con-
sidered academic performance as a factor for both students
with and without disabilities. For regular education students,
teachers felt it was better to retain them in the earlier grades
and remembered retaining a student in the past that had been
a positive experience.
When considering what factors teacher's use in regard to
grade retention, academic performance was the most promi-
nent. This is consistent with the literature (Witmer et al.,
2004). Maturity continues to be an important factor espe-
cially among teachers of the lower grades and special educa-
tors. Special education teachers as a whole tended to consider
more factors when considering retention decisions. Teachers
were also concerned about the amount of remedial support
their students would be receiving in the next grade.
The hypothesis for this study was that teachers are retain-
ing students with disabilities due to the pressures associated
with passing the high stakes testing in the upcoming years.
Teachers were clear that they felt pressure to raise the test
scores. They indicated that they were being held accountable
for the student's progress and MCAS had changed the way
they were teaching. However, they did not feel high stakes
testing alone was increasing the prevalence of grade reten-
tion in their district. The teachers felt test scores should be
one piece of a larger picture that is examined by a team when
making a decision regarding grade retention. Teachers
reported that when they would like to retain a child they
needed to gather all test scores as well as work samples and
send it to central administration before retaining a student. It
was noted that this was a new policy that was developed in
the past 2 years.
Recommendations
After a review of the findings in this study and the literature,
recommendations can be made for both district administra-
tors and teachers.
For District Administrators
·
· Continue to provide professional development for
teachers regarding how to support struggling learners.
Teachers indicated on the survey that they were inter-
ested in more training.
·
· Continue to make grade retention a team decision.
Test scores should be one factor of many when con-
sidering this decision.
·
· Evaluate more ways to support struggling students.
Look at school personnel to consider who can help
provide interventions for at-risk students.
For Teachers
·
· Continue to provide students with research-based
teaching that supports all students.
·
· Consider a multitude of factors when making a deci-
sion regarding grade retention. Familiarize and edu-
cate yourself on the research regarding grade
retention.
·
· Work with building administrators to develop a plan
to provide interventions for struggling students to pre-
vent grade retention.
For Further Study
This study explored teacher perceptions regarding grade
retention for students with and without disabilities. After
reviewing the findings, area of future research are
recommended:
·
· What specific interventions can be provided to strug-
gling students to prevent grade retention for students
with and without disabilities?
·
· How can students be supported when they are strug-
gling but do not qualify for special education
services?
·
· How can students with disabilities be supported to
pass the high stakes test?
·
· What are the effects of high stakes testing on grade
retention for students with disabilities?
·
· What is the relationship of teacher perceptions of
grade retention in regard to the setting in which they
are teaching--urban versus suburban?
Summary
This mixed-methods study examined teacher perceptions
regarding grade retention for students with and without dis-
abilities. The results of this study indicate that teachers con-
sider a multitude of factors when considering grade retention
for their struggling students. Academic performance and
maturity were the factors that were indicated the most.
Teachers reported they felt pressure and accountability in
regard to high stakes testing but did not believe it was or
should be the sole reason a child is retained. Teachers felt
grade retention needed to be a team decision and a variety of
factors need to be considered.
Special education teachers considered more factors than
regular education teachers when making a decision about
grade retention. Teachers felt retention was more effective
for regular education students if it was done in an earlier
grade and teachers could recall a past experience where they
Renaud 11
had retained a student and it was a positive experience.
Overall, the results of this study were consistent with the
research on teacher perceptions about grade retention.
