Mating Success

Abstract: Cross-culturally, male economic power is directly related to reproductive
success. Displays of wealth and social status are an important part of human male mating
effort. The degree of male financial consumption may be related to variance in life history
strategies, as differences in life history patterns are fundamentally differences in the
allocation of effort and/or resources. Males who have higher mating intentions may
maximize their economic displays, saving little and even spending beyond their capacity
through the use of credit. These men may seek and possibly obtain a greater number of
sexual partners. This hypothesis was tested in a randomly selected community sample of
men aged 18-45 included in a telephone health interview. The degree of financial
consumption was directly related to future mating intentions and past mating success, even
when accounting for age, years of education completed, and marital status. The degree of
financial consumption was not related to future mating intentions or past mating success for
women in the same sample.

Introduction
This paper argues that human male tendencies for financial consumption, in terms
of maximizing purchasing rather than accruing savings, partially reflect the allocation of
resources to mating competition. In most animal species, males compete for females
because females usually invest more in offspring and are therefore selected to be more
discriminating in selecting mates (Bateman, 1948). Sometimes male mating competition
involves fighting other males for rank or territory; sometimes it requires traits and displays
that females prefer in their mates. Males who succeed in these competitions have more
offspring, and this shapes traits that foster such success, even if those traits may also lead to
detrimental consequences (Darwin, 1871).
Physiological sexual dimorphism in humans indicates that male mating competition
is substantial (Leutenegger and Kelley, 1977; Plavcan and van Schaik, 1997), yet paternal

investment is still much larger in humans than in other primates (Buss and Schmitt, 1993;
Geary and Flinn, 2001). Children who grow up without a father present suffer higher
mortality rates (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and paternal investment in offspring may enhance
the offspring's reproductive success (Geary, 2005). Across cultures, women differentially
evaluate male socio-economic status in considerations of partner suitability, as it may
indicate paternal investment potential (Buss, 1989).
Darwin was initially puzzled by costly traits such as peacock tails that could not be
accounted for by survival advantage; he later concluded that these were features that led to
reproductive advantage (1871). For humans, male displays of wealth may literally be a
costly signal analogue to the peacock's tail (Miller and Todd, 1998). Displays of
prestigious consumer goods could be an honest signal of male mate value, as they would
indicate available resources as well as skills at acquiring wealth (Colarelli and Dettman,
2003). Veblen (1899/1953) remarked on the relationship between prestige and the
consumption of consumer goods and even suggested that inherited psychological
mechanisms were responsible for this relationship. Colarelli and Dettman (2003) note that
advertisers are well aware of the importance of prestige when marketing products, and will
try to associate a product with prestige even when there is no functional relationship. An
ethnographic study of Amazonian foragers and slash-and-burn farmers found that those
who had greater monetary resources allocated a greater portion of expenditures towards
luxury goods, and this tendency was stronger in men than in women (Godoy et al., 2007).
Male displays of wealth and social status may facilitate mating competition. During
ancestral times, men with greater resource control married younger women, married more
women, and produced offspring earlier (Low, 1998). Males who did not have substantial
resources or status may have been unable to establish long-term relationships. Across a
wide variety of societies, male reproductive success is a function of social and economic
status (Hopcroft, 2006). Even in current foraging societies that are relatively egalitarian,
men with higher status have more mating opportunities (Chagnon, 1992; Hill and Hurtado,
1996).
Several laboratory studies have demonstrated that situational primes making mating
effort salient can induce male intentions to increase economic power as well as allocate
financial resources to conspicuous products. Roney (2003) found that men reported
stronger ambition and desire to earn money when in the presence of attractive women. This
effect was even seen when the men simply viewed photographs of attractive women. In
another study, men who were shown photographs of attractive women had intentions to
allocate more money to conspicuous products, but not inconspicuous products
(Griskevicius et al., 2007). Neither men who viewed photographs of unattractive women,
nor women who viewed photographs of attractive or unattractive men exhibited this
pattern. In a third study, men who viewed photographs of attractive women discounted the
future more so when choosing between small monetary rewards than men who viewed
unattractive women or women who viewed pictures of men (Wilson and Daly, 2004).
Variability in male financial risk taking
The degree of male financial consumption may be related to variance in life history
strategy. Males who are relatively higher in mating effort may have a greater tendency to
maximize their display of economic power, saving little and even spending beyond their
capacity through the use of credit. These men may seek and possibly obtain a greater
Male financial consumption

number of sexual partners. There are several factors which may be related to both financial
risk taking and mating effort in men.
First, both financial risk taking and mating effort may be related to age.
Independent of birth cohort effects, men exhibit financial strategies that are increasingly
more conservative as they age (Jianakoplos and Bernasek, 2006). In modern societies, male
resource allocation for mating effort appears to shift towards paternal effort across
adulthood, as indicated by fertility levels (Tuljapurkar, Puleston, and Gurven, 2007) and
mortality rates from risky behaviors (Kruger and Nesse, 2004). Male testosterone levels in
the U.S. begin to decline in the late third or early fourth decade, and decline at a constant
rate in later decades (Baker and Hudson, 1983). Male mating effort may peak in young
adulthood in part because young men may not have partners or offspring to invest in. This
may increase their attractiveness to females because they would have more resources
available for prospective partners and their potential offspring (Hill and Kaplan, 1999).
Secondly, entering into a committed relationship by definition implies a shift away
from mating effort and towards investment in the relationship and potential offspring. This
shift may be reflected in allocation of financial resources. Even among low-income
households, married households had higher savings goals and greater frequency and
amounts of savings deposits, compared to unmarried households (Grinstein-Weiss and
Sherraden, 2006). Across ages, men who are unmarried demonstrate riskier behavior than
those who are married, as demonstrated by divergence in mortality rates (Kruger and
Nesse, 2006). Yet, marriage may not completely constrain mating effort, as both men and
women may benefit from mixed mating strategies, investing in a stable partnership while
simultaneously taking advantage of opportunities for extra-pair relationships (Gangestad
and Simpson, 2000).
Third, Socio-Economic Status (SES) may influence both financial strategies and
relationship stability. Men and women with higher educational attainment have a reduced
likelihood of divorce (e.g., South, 2001). Individuals who develop in relatively uncertain
environments are expected to develop riskier behavioral strategies to take advantage of
possibly fleeting opportunities (Chisholm, 1999; Roff, 1992; Stearns, 1992), which may
include riskier financial strategies. Socio-economic position is related to the degree of risk
in male behavioral strategies, as indicated by the inverse relationships between male
mortality rates from external causes with educational attainment and income (Kruger, and
Nesse, 2006). Increases in the uncertainly of economic opportunities also elevated male
mortality rates from external (behavioral) causes (Kruger, and Nesse, 2007). Those with
relatively less financial resources may also find it more difficult to save because of the
costs of expenditures for basic needs and non-luxury goods.
Financial consumption and mating success
The current study is designed to test the hypothesis that the degree of male financial
consumption, in terms of the tendency to maximize purchasing rather than accruing
savings, is associated with mating effort, as indicated by mating intentions and mating
success. Caloric models of resource allocation are appropriate for pre-industrial
populations, however male resource allocation in modern populations may be best
measured in economic and temporal terms. In many modern societies, one can even
allocate more resources than one has actually obtained through the use of credit and debt.
Male financial consumption
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(4). 2008. -606-
This increases the potential level of consumption in financial strategies, as debts that are
not paid off promptly will accrue interest and increase overall costs.
The current analyses will examine the degree of risk in male resource allocation
with financial consumption measures appropriate for modern credit based economies.
Analyses will account for age, marital status, and educational achievement (as a SES
indicator). These factors are not posed as alternative explanations, but rather are part of the
complex set of relationships involving life history and behavioral strategies. The
relationships of financial consumption with mating intention and mating success are
expected to be substantially stronger for men than for women because female mate value is
more centrally related to cues of fecundity rather than resource provisioning potential (e.g.,
Buss, 1989).
Materials and Methods
Data to test this hypothesis were provided by randomly selected male (M±SD age =
34±7 years, n = 100) and female (M±SD age = 34±7 years, n = 309) telephone respondents
included in a community health surveillance survey. Data from female respondents were
analyzed to provide a comparison with the results for men. The study was originally
designed to provide a broad assessment of community health rather than to examine these
predictions, so this study includes limitations typical for secondary analyses of data (see
Discussion).
The sampling plan was designed to compare demographically similar ZIP codes in
the cities of Flint and Saginaw, Michigan, and suburban areas surrounding these cities. The
sampling frame was all adults ages 18-45 whose households were included in non-
commercial telephone sampling lists for seven designated ZIP Codes. Four men over age
45 accidentally included in the sample were excluded in these analyses. Eighteen cases
were excluded due to missing data in the variables described below. Computer Aided
Telephone Interviews (CATIs) were conducted by professional survey interview staff
members at the Michigan Public Health Institute who were unaware of the hypothesis
tested in this study.
Three items assessed tendencies for financial conservation versus consumption: I
always live within my income range; Each income period, I set aside at least ten percent for
savings; I pay off my entire credit card bill each month (Cronbachs alpha = .77). These
items were reverse scored to create a scale of financial consumption. Three items adapted
from the Sociosexuality Inventory (SOI; Gangestad and Simpson, 1992) indicated mating
intentions and mating success. A timeframe was added to these items because part of the
purpose of the study was to monitor trends across survey waves: With how many different
partners have you had sexual intercourse within the past five years; How many sexual
partners would you like to have in the next five years; In the past 12 months, how many
different partners have you had sex with on one and only one occasion. Data for these items
were not reliable as a scale (Cronbachs alpha = .41), so they were analyzed separately.
Responses to these items were log transformed to guard against the influence of outliers.
Respondent age was calculated from reported birth date and interview date. Marital
status was assessed with the item, "What is your current marital status?" with response
options of single, married or partnered, separated, widowed, and divorced. Responses to
this item were transformed into binary categories for married or partnered vs. single,
Male financial consumption

separated, widowed, or divorced. Educational attainment was assessed by the item, "What
is the highest grade or degree you completed in school?" and responses were transformed
into years of education completed (e.g., High School = 12, Bachelor's degree = 16).
Stepwise linear regressions included age, marital status, years of education
completed, and financial consumption as predictors of each log transformed SOI outcome
variable. Separate analyses were conducted for men and women, as the relationships
between financial consumption and mating indicators were expected to be substantially
weaker for women. Male and female samples were combined to provide a direct test of the
predicted moderation by sex. Gender (1 = female, 2 = male) and financial consumption
were multiplied to create an interaction term predicting each log transformed SOI outcome
variable.
Results
For men, older respondents were more likely to be married, have fewer sexual
partners in the past five years, and have fewer one-time sexual encounters in the past 12
months (see Table 1). Married respondents on average completed more years of education,
have fewer sexual partners in the past five years, and have fewer one-time sexual
encounters in the past 12 months. The degree of financial consumption was directly related
to the number of sexual partners in the past five years and the number of sexual partners
desired in the next five years. The number of sexual partners in the past five years was
directly related to the number of one-time sexual encounters in the past 12 months and the
number of sexual partners desired in the next five years. The zero order correlations
between financial consumption and indicators of mating intention or mating success were
not significant for women.

For men, financial consumption made a significant unique prediction of the number
of sexual partners in the past five years and the number of sexual partners desired in the
next five years (See Table 2). Financial consumption was not uniquely related to the
number of one time sexual partners in men. Age was inversely related to the number of

sexual partners in past five years, and men who were married had fewer one time sexual
partners in the past 12 months. For women, financial consumption was not significantly
related to any mating indicator. Women who were older, completed more years of
education, and were married had fewer sexual partners in the past five years. Women who
completed more years of education had fewer one time sexual partners. Women who were
older and women who were married desired fewer sexual partners in the next five years.
The predictions using the interaction term for financial consumption and gender indicated
that the relationships between financial consumption and the number of sexual partners in
the past five years and the number of sexual partners desired in the next five years were
substantially stronger for men than for women.

Discussion
Results support the prediction that the degree of consumption in male financial
strategies would be related to mating intentions and mating success. Men who allocated
more financial resources to expenditures rather than to savings and were more likely to
spend more than they earned reported having more sexual partners in the past five years
and desired a greater number of sexual partners in the next five years. These relationships
were significant even when accounting for other possibly influential factors; age, marital
status, and educational achievement.
These findings complement the results of typical psychological studies of students
enrolled in introductory psychology courses. Whereas laboratory studies provide a higher
degree of experimental control, the current study is based on reports of actual behaviors in
a representative community sample. The randomly selected sample of men from the
community are likely to have a wider range in life history strategy than predominantly
young and often relatively affluent university students, and the older average age of
respondents allowed for a greater degree of opportunity for the experiences and behaviors
of interest. Behavioral measures were used for both financial strategy and mating success,
in addition to measures of behavioral intentions.

The results of this study do contrast with previous studies on psychology students,
in that the laboratory studies demonstrated short-term induction effects from primes of
desirable mates on economic intentions. The current study examines relatively stable
individual differences in both mating and financial strategies. The laboratory studies
demonstrate the relationship between mating salience and financial strategies within
individuals, the current study documents a similar relationship across individuals.
Although behaviors related to greater financial consumption predicted the number
of mating partners in the recent past, it was not related to the number of one-time sexual
encounters. These items adapted from the Sociosexuality Inventory (SOI) used different
time frames. The total number of recent partners was assessed from the past five years,
whereas sex partners for one and only one occasion were assessed only in the past 12
months. This temporal difference may partially account for the differences in results,
although one-time sexual encounters may also be qualitatively distinct from other types of
sexual relationships. Male resource provisioning is more important factor in female mate
choice for long-term relationships than for short-term relationships (Gangestad and
Simpson, 2000; Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling, 2003), so male resource displays may not be
as influential as physiological Indicators of phenotypic quality.
The measures used in this study were quite brief compared to many psychological
assessments. A more comprehensive assessment of financial strategies and mating effort
could potentially consume an entire questionnaire. The data originated from a community
health survey that covered a broad range of issues and was limited in length, given the
constraints of telephone interviews with uncompensated respondents. Only three items
were used to assess financial risk taking, and mating intentions and success were assessed
with only three items from the SOI. Demographic measures utilized single items. Despite
its brevity, the financial risk taking scale demonstrated high inter-item reliability and
significant predictive power. The data were also collected from one geographic region in a
single state in the USA. Future studies could attempt to replicate the results in additional
populations.
Measures of educational attainment have previously demonstrated their utility as
socioeconomic indicators. Educational attainment was also a significant predictor of
financial strategies in the current study. Given the focus on financial risk taking, it would
also have been valuable to assess respondents' income levels. However, this is a sensitive
issue in the focus communities, which are subject to economic hardships related to trends
in the American automotive industry. Previous surveys conducted in the same region
utilizing similar methodologies had refusal rates from 45 to 60% on income items, despite
attempts to modify items to increase the response rate. Respondents would also
occasionally terminate the interview when asked about income. Because of the relatively
low returns from income items in previous surveys, questions on income level were not
included in the current study. A different survey conducted in the previous year in the same
community found that educational attainment and household income were related, r(1320)
= .39, p < .001.
One may argue that sexual behavior and financial risk taking would necessarily be
correlated because of individual differences in generalized sensation seeking and risk
taking. However, this would require an explanation of why these individual differences are
maintained in populations, which would necessarily involve an explanatory framework
compatible with the current understanding of evolution and human behavior. Recent studies
Male financial consumption

have demonstrated that there are distinct domains of risk taking, and distinguished between
financial risks, physical risks, and social risks, for example (Kruger, Wang, and Wilke,
2007; Weber, Blais, and Betz, 2002; Wilke, Hutchinson, Todd, and Kruger, 2006). Also,
these relationships were significant for men but not for women, and resource control is
more centrally related to male than to female reproductive strategies. There was even
greater statistical power to uncover these relationships for the female sample, as it was
slightly more than three times the size of the male sample.
The promising results of this study may inspire future research on the connection
between life history strategy and financial risk taking. More sophisticated measures could
assess the proportion of economic resources allocated to visible luxury goods versus
necessary staple goods. One could assess the degree of ostentation among various cars,
clothes, and personal accessories. Longitudinal studies could assess developmental
pathways, and indicate the directions of causality, which cannot be inferred from the cross-
sectional data in the current model. For example, the data do not reveal whether the greater
economic displays enabled by financial consumption were directly responsible for
enhanced male mating success. Behavioral economics and social psychology have already
benefited tremendously from the adoption of evolutionary models. This study suggests
further advances may arise with the integration of life history into research on economic
behavior.
