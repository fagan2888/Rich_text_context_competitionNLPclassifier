Introduction
The emergence of e-book readers as a realistic alternative for
content delivery gives us the opportunity to reexamine
usability issues with regard to e-books and other e-texts. Our
main research question in the following article is whether
current e-book readers loaded with curriculum-based e-books
and articles can provide an effective learning experience for
students in higher education.
Academic libraries have been purchasing e-books for
quite a few years. Electronic versions of major reference
work such as encyclopedias and dictionaries were natural
candidates for purchase in the beginning. Pioneering vendors
such as Ebrary and Netlibrary were successful in launching
subscription-based collections for academic libraries at an
early stage. An expansion of interest in the field seemed to
occur around the year 2000. The journal Library Hi Tech
devoted a special issue to e-books more than 10 years ago
(D. Dillon, 2001a, 2001b)
The number of offerings from vendors and publishers and
the percentage of library funds devoted to e-books have
grown considerably the last few years. Duke University
Press conducted a survey of libraries with regard to e-books
in 2011; of the 265 libraries that responded, only 3 did not
purchase e-books at all. A majority of the libraries have also
increased the amount of funds devoted to e-books in spite of
the current economic climate.
One factor that still limits the use of e-books in higher
education is the limited availability of e-textbooks. Only
20% of the English language books on the required reading
lists at the University of Agder were available for purchase
as e-books when this was checked in 2010. The situation
regarding Norwegian textbooks is even less satisfactory,
almost none of these are available as e-books.
The e-books we have made available to patrons have
mostly been for online PC-based usage with limited possi-
bilities for downloading and printing. Access to an e-book
version does not seem to fulfill the needs of our students and
faculty members as interlibrary loan or purchase requests are
often made. Preferences for print have been clearly docu-
mented at other academic libraries that have questioned fac-
ulty or students in regard to e-books. A recent survey of
attitudes among business school faculty at Brigham Young
University (Camacho & Spackman, 2011) showed that 61%
would prefer a book in print format if they could choose.
Ease of reading and portability were the two important rea-
sons for preferring print.

E-Book Readers in Higher Education:
Student Reading Preferences and
Other Data From Surveys at the
University of Agder
Arthur N. Olsen1, Birgitte Kleivset1 and Henry Langseth1
Abstract
This article reports on a research project at the University of Agder that has studied the use of e-readers as a tool for
academic study. E-readers (Kindle DX and iPad) were loaded with texts from required reading lists in five courses with 94
participating students. Initially, 87 students responded to the invitation to participate in a survey, but eventually 13 of these
submissions had to be removed, as the degree of completion was not sufficient. The final response rate achieved was 79%.
Students were in general positive to the use of e-readers but still show a preference for print on paper as the best medium
for serious academic study. When reading books, 54% preferred print, 28% a combination of print and e-reader, and finally
only 11% were satisfied solely using an e-reader. The iPad scored significantly better than the Kindle DX on tasks that
required active interaction with the texts such as highlighting and note taking.

The University of Agder has established a multiyear pro-
gram to explore ways that the deployment of new or innova-
tive technology can enhance learning for our students who
belong to a generation of Digital Natives (Prensky, 2001).
The program Learning Arena 2020 (LA2020)1 offers funding
for pilot projects that contribute to the implementation of
ideas and projects aimed at improving student learning out-
comes. A dialogue between LA2020 and Agder University
Library resulted in funding for a project to explore the use of
e-readers as a learning tool. Funds were provided to purchase
40 e-readers (20 Kindle DX second generation and 20 iPad
first generation) in addition to some e-content course mate-
rial and salary for staff. Extensive information from the proj-
ect is available on our blog (mostly in Norwegian).2
Earlier Studies
There is a quite extensive body of literature that has studied
digital reading. The transition from the physical book or print
on paper to screen reading confronts one with a series of
questions on how this changes the way we read and how this
influences comprehension and learning outcomes. A. Dillon
(1992) provides a detailed review and synopsis of early
research on reading speed, accuracy, and comprehension
when reading from paper in contrast to VDUs (Visual
Display Units). These early studies generally favored paper
for better performance in regard to the metrics mentioned
above. Today's high-quality LCD- and LED-based screens
are very different from the VDUs of the 1980s and 1990s.
Despite great improvement in display technology, users still
seem to dislike on-screen reading for extended periods.
Results regarding learning outcomes have recently been
reported by Ackerman and Goldsmith (2011). Their study
shows that test performance was just as good for on-screen
as paper reading when study time was fixed. However, when
study time was self-regulated, the results changed for the
worse in regard to on-screen reading. The authors explain
this difference in terms of the varying quality of metacogni-
tion, in this case monitoring one's comprehension while
reading. It seems that readers often overestimate their prog-
ress when reading on-screen.
Another recent study (Schugar, Schugar, & Penny, 2011)
is one of the first that has analyzed differences in reading
comprehension between print on paper and a modern e-reader
based on e-ink. One group of students read the required texts
on the Nook e-reader while the control group read printed
books. Formal testing showed no discernible differences in
reading comprehension levels between the e-reader and
none-reader groups. One significant difference between the
groups was the level of interaction with the texts; readers of
the traditional texts were much more active as regards book-
marking, highlighting, and annotations. This result could be
linked to limited and cumbersome functionality for interac-
tion in the Nook e-reader.
TexasA&M University Libraries have pioneered the eval-
uation of the new generation of e-readers based on e-ink. The
university library launched a project to test the new Kindle
e-book reader from Amazon in 2008. They recruited a group
of 36 students for a long-term study of usability.Aqualitative
analysis of user viewpoints based on a survey and focus
group sessions was held after the students had used the
e-readers for 1 month. Results of the focus groups showed
that students found the Kindle suitable for immersive fiction
reading but felt that there were major problems in regard to
document availability, graphics, and licensing issues. About
half the students believed that the Kindle would never be a
realistic alternative to the printed book (Clark, Goodwin,
Samuelson, & Coker, 2008). Some of the negative view-
points in regard to the Kindle in this study are less relevant
for the current Kindle e-readers (third generation) that have
better screen contrast and more refined software at a much
lower price. Texas A&M University Libraries has followed
this study with a lending program for Kindles that focuses on
popular reading material as the devices were found to be less
appropriate for academic study (Clark, 2009).
In conjunction with the launch of the Kindle DX reader in
2009, Amazon sponsored a pilot project involving seven
U.S. universities the goal of which was to evaluate the feasi-
bility of replacing students' paper texts with electronic texts
presented on an e-reader. Many of the studies were cut short
because of protests from the American Council of the Blind
that the device could not be used by blind students. Some
interesting results have been made public but mostly as
reports and not in the peer-reviewed literature. A pilot project
was established at Princeton University (2010) involving
three faculty members and 51 students. Three courses, one
undergraduate and two graduate in the humanities and social
sciences, were chosen for the project. Three major goals
were identified for the project: first, to reduce the amount of
printing needed for the required readings; second, to evaluate
if the Kindle DX could provide a better learning environment
than the traditional paper-based experience; and third, to
evaluate current technology and provide thoughts about key
features for future devices.
The goal of reducing printing was achieved but students
reported many unsatisfactory aspects of the e-readers in
regard to the active learning process. Reading was deemed to
be acceptable but interaction with the texts in the form of
comments, highlighting, and annotation was difficult and
much less intuitive than with paper-based documents.
Reed College is another of the participants in the Kindle
DX pilot study that has reported their findings (Marmarelli &
Ringle, 2009). The students praised the Kindle DX for good
legibility and battery life among other features but criticized
other aspects of the device. PDF handling was deemed as
unsatisfactory with a complete lack of facilities for high-
lighting and note taking. Specific passages in the mono-
graphs in Kindle format could not be referred to by page.
Using the e-reader made work with several texts at one time
difficult. Reed has followed their Kindle DX study with a
study of the Apple iPad in an academic setting (Marmarelli
& Ringle, 2011). The findings from this study are more
Olsen et al. 3
positive to the device's potential as an efficient study tool
than the previous Kindle study. Students consider the iPad to
be responsive and flexible with adequate tools for highlight-
ing and annotation. Students do not report excessive fatigue
when reading due to the LCD screen.
A team at the Aalto University in Finland has recently
studied five e-readers based on e-ink technology (Aaltonen,
Mannonen, Nieminen, & Nieminen, 2011). The e-readers3
were first evaluated for compatibility in relation to the
e-book holdings at the university library. In general, e-books
from publishers such as Springer are fully compatible and
easy to use with e-readers. E-books from aggregators such
as DawsonEra are in general not usable due to digital rights
management (DRM) incompatibilities. A high-quality
usability study involving students was also undertaken.
Only four of the e-readers were tested as the Amazon Kindle
had to be dropped due to technical difficulties. Students
liked reading material on the e-readers and also thought that
they might purchase one for leisure reading. They found that
the devices lacked necessary functionality for serious study.
Note taking, highlighting, and annotation were viewed as
cumbersome. Nonlinear reading requiring efficient naviga-
tion and browsing was too difficult.
The first long-term study of the Amazon Kindle DX
reader has been published by a group at the University of
Washington (Thayer et al., 2011). The study examines the
academic potential of e-readers by making use of A. K.
Pugh's notions of reading strategies. Pugh identifies five stu-
dent reading techniques--scanning, search reading, skim-
ming, receptive reading, and responsive reading (Thayer et
al., 2011). The study suggests that the Kindle DX supports
receptive reading but is poor on skimming, scanning, search
reading, and responsive reading. Students switch between
reading techniques rapidly. A successful future for e-readers
in academia "depends on understanding how to support stu-
dents' varied reading practices more effectively" (Thayer et
al., 2011, p. 2925).
There has been a range of projects at other Norwegian
universities and university colleges involving e-readers in an
academic setting. We have collaborated and exchanged
information with colleagues in an informal network.
Preliminary results have been published informally in blogs
and other venues but formal publications are now
appearing.
A project looking into e-curriculum at the NTNU
University Library in Trondheim (Angeletaki, 2011) was
conducted in 2010. E-readers loaded with material from
reading lists were introduced to students in two courses.
Of the 46 students asked, 12 willing students borrowed
e-readers. After the test period, 80% of the 12 said they
preferred reading on the digital readers rather than from
printouts. The main goal of the project was "to investigate
how library staff can help University researchers and stu-
dents to easily access up-to-date electronic resources and
assure quality service" (Angeletaki, 2011, p. s4).The use
of new technology in the project seemed to contribute to
a user-oriented library service. The project manager
Alexandra Angeletaki states that "this type of collabora-
tive project allows the library to establish itself as a learn-
ing space and an important educational collaborator for
the faculty it serves" (Angeletaki, 2011, p. s5).
A project based at Oslo University College (Eikebrokk,
Knutsen, & Thaule, 2011) has explored whether the use of an
iPad could improve students'study habits. The iPad was cho-
sen as it was the e-reader/tablet that had the greatest degree
of utility as regards the licensed e-resources at the institution.
After a semester of use by students in two study programs,
the students received an electronic survey and participated in
focus group meetings. A major finding was that students
thought that facilities for taking notes, printing, and access-
ing documents were less than ideal. The participants found
that the iPad worked well for reading online documents and
shorter articles but not so well for books. DRM-related issues
contributed to reduced user satisfaction.
The earlier studies above regarding e-readers based on
e-ink seem to point to the fact the this technology is now
mature enough for immersive leisure reading but still defi-
cient as far as serious study is concerned. Tablets such as the
iPad are a different class of device with a stronger feature set
for vital functions such as navigation, highlighting, and
annotation. Very few studies have been done based on the
iPad or other tablets, but these devices seem to have potential
for higher education as the study at Oslo University College
shows.
Chosen E-Book Readers
Describing current e-book readers is a challenge as technical
specifications change rapidly. The number of offerings
worldwide has grown immensely but the number of major
players is limited. Readers based on e-ink screens have been
available since 2004 but Amazon's launch of the Kindle
e-book reader in late 2007 was a major turning point for mar-
ket penetration. Most users prefer e-ink screens for better
readability and ergonomics for extended reading, but there is
little research that shows a definitive advantage in compari-
son with modern LCD/LED screens as regards visual fatigue.
Two different readers were chosen for further study at
Agder University based on a study of availability and fea-
tures. We focused on readers that were marketed as suitable
for use in higher education. Delays were encountered due to
limited availability in Norway. In all, 20 Amazon Kindle DX
(first-generation international version) readers were pur-
chased in June 2010 and 20 Apple iPad (first generation) tab-
lets were purchased from June to November 2010.
The Kindle DX comes with a 24.6 cm (9.7 inch) E-Ink
screen instead of the 15.2 cm (6 inch) normal Kindle screen.
It has support for International 3G Wireless and native sup-
port for PDF documents. We were rather unfortunate with
the timing of this purchase asAmazon launched the improved
4 SAGE Open
second-generation Kindle DX (graphite) in July 2010. This
version has much improved screen contrast and some
improvements in PDF handing. As for all Kindles, the DX is
only compatible with e-books in Mobi and Amazon AZW
format.
We purchased the first-generation iPad WiFi with 16 MB
memory. The iPad's touchscreen display is a 25 cm (9.7 inch)
liquid crystal display (1024 × 768 pixels) with fingerprint-
resistant and scratch-resistant glass. The iPad is a multifunc-
tion device which is especially suitable for media
consumption. Our focus was reading e-texts, both e-books in
flowable formats and PDFs. The functionality of the iPad can
be extended in many ways by installing suitable Apps.
Students who participated in our study were advised that the
following iPad Apps were recommended:
·
· Dropbox for file transfer4
·
· iBooks and Kindle for e-books
·
· GoodReader5 or ReaddleDocs6 for PDF reading, high-
lighting, and annotation
Research Goals and Methodology
As stated above, our main research focus for this study was
to establish whether current e-book readers loaded with the
relevant electronic texts could replace printed books and
journal articles in an academic setting. A correct analysis of
the realism in the transition from print to e-reader is vital
for academic libraries when establishing a future library
media acquisition policy. Secondary research questions
were related to a variety of usability issues of the studies'
e-readers.
The University of Agder has more than 9,000 students.
Teaching and research cover a wide range of subjects. In this
study, we asked 94 students from four study programs to use
the Kindle or iPad for one semester (47% men, 53% women,
average number of years as students at the university 4.2).
Participants were offered the opportunity to download books
and articles from the reading list, or other types of relevant
resources that they might want, if available. Due to limited
availability in compatible e-formats, only about 40% of the
reading list material was accessible for the students on elec-
tronic reading devices.
Students in four courses were given the Kindle DX or
iPad:
·
· European Integration, a problem-oriented summer
course for students at the master level introducing his-
torical, economic, and political processes behind the
development of a European Community. In the sum-
mer of 2010, 20 students were asked to use the Kindle
DX, and the following summer, 20 students read texts
from their reading lists on the iPad and 9 on the Kindle
DX.
·
· Social Communication, a multidisciplinary, profes-
sionally oriented master's program in humanities and
the social sciences. From September to December
2010, 11 students received books and articles from
their reading lists on Kindle DX. From January to
June, 19 students were given iPads to read from.
·
· English Renaissance Culture in Context, a course
about the socioeconomic change and technological
innovation in Renaissance England. From January to
June 2011, 7 students were offered the opportunity to
download books and articles from their reading lists to
the Kindle DX.
·
· Communication Studies, a bachelor's program about
text, media, and communication from a humanistic
perspective. From January to June 2011, 9 students
read articles from their reading lists on the Kindle DX.
Concise information about the trial courses are given
in Table 1.
Results
Initially, 87 students responded to the invitation to partici-
pate, but eventually 13 of these submissions had to be
removed, as the degree of completion was insufficient.7
In total, 94 students were invited to participate, thus
leaving the survey with a final response rate of 79%. No
incentives were offered for completing the survey, but the
students were made aware of the obligation they had
upon receiving the reading device. The project period
spanned from June 2010 till August 2011 and involved
five different classes from humanities and the social sci-
ences. The students had 3 weeks to complete the survey
and received a reminder after 10 days if no response had
been given. To ensure a sufficient response rate, SMS,
phone, and Facebook messages were also utilized to give
reminders. A total of 46% of the participants left a com-
ment using the open-ended question at the end of the
survey.
Sample Surveyed
In all, 77% of the students were between 20 and 30 years of
age, and there were slightly more female respondents (54%)
than male. On average, the students had been studying for
4.2 years, and 83% of the respondents were master students
at the time they completed the survey. In terms of how the
students access the Internet, 91% of the sample surveyed use
a PC several times a day for this purpose. In addition, 42%
use a smartphone and 22% a traditional mobile phone for
surfing. These figures are in-line with previous studies
among Norwegians (Statistics Norway, 2012).
Device Characteristics
The students were enthusiastic about receiving the e-reader
and were asked to describe their first impressions regarding
some of the features. In total, 61% categorized the design as
either good or very good, and 64% were also satisfied with

the weight of the device. The Kindle DX and the iPad used in
this survey weigh 540 and 680 grams, respectively. Only 3%
found the screen to be poor. As many as 81% were also
pleased with battery capacity.
Navigation and Usage
As seen in Figure 1, the students were asked to rate different
features of the e-reader. Only 40% found general navigation
satisfying. However, 66% stated they were satisfied with
finding the main menu on the device. Opening a document
was found to be poor among only 9% of the students and
66% thought turning pages were either good or very good.
The percentage of students who were less satisfied with the
time it took to load a new page was 29%. As for zooming,
56% were satisfied with this feature. Switching between dif-
ferent documents was found to be poor or very poor by 30%
of the students. In all, 69% were satisfied with returning to a
document they had previously opened. The possibilities to
take notes within a document were categorized as either poor
or very poor by 46% of the students, and also 23% found it
neither poor nor good. Furthermore, only 21% thought the
possibility to highlight text was satisfactory. In this case, as
many as 14% stated that they did not know about this option.
Print or Electronic?
A total of 79% thought the e-reader was good or very good
for reading journal articles but a little less, 61%, had a similar
opinion as regards reading books. Despite a high degree of
satisfaction with the e-readers, fewer saw themselves as
solely relying on such a device. Having been given the
opportunity to read literature from the reading list on an
e-reader, 54% replied that they still preferred paper in terms
6 SAGE Open
Figure 2. E-reader versus print.
Figure 3. Location of e-reader usage: Where have you been using the reading device?
of books. Only 11% would rely solely on the device, and
28% found that combining paper and an e-reader was best
for study purposes. Seven percent answered that they did not
know what kind of format they preferred books to be in. This
is illustrated in Figure 2.
The results for reading journal articles were somewhat
more positive for e-readers. In all, 24% preferred just using
the e-reader, and 32% saw themselves using a combination
of print and the e-reader. However, 41% still wanted to stay
with paper versions of journal articles, and 3% were not sure
which format they preferred such documents to be in.
Academic Setting and Learning Outcomes
Location. In regard to location of use, Figure 3 above shows
that 59% of the students never or seldom brought it with
them to class. A total of 44% sometimes or often used it out-
doors, and 50% had also used it when traveling. Interest-
ingly, 49% had also taken the e-reader with them to bed.
Purpose.The students had the e-readers in their possession
from 1 to 4 months, depending on which course they were
attending. In our study, we wanted to find out to what extent
the e-readers had been used for entertainment only. Surpris-
ingly, 56% never or seldom used the e-reader for entertain-
ment; however 26% stated they did sometimes. Of the
sample surveyed, 19% used it either often or all the time for
entertainment.
When asked to what extent they had used it for academic
purposes, only 19% seldom or never used it for academic
studies and 46% replied that they used it sometimes for this
purpose. There were 27% who used it often for academic
studies while 8% used the e-reader all the time.
Asked what the main purpose had been when using the
e-reader, a majority of 39% used it mainly when preparing
for lectures as illustrated in Figure 4. Next, 34% stated their
main purpose was studying for exams. Sixteen percent had
used it in class, and last, 11% replied they mainly used it dur-
ing group work and similar sessions.
Kindle Versus iPad. Although this study has not had its main
focus on the student's perceptions of the Kindle and iPad,
some findings should still be mentioned as the results
clearly show differences between the two reading devices.
Olsen et al. 7
First, the iPad receives better scores in terms of turning
pages. In total, 46% thought this feature was very good
using the iPad and 20% gave the similar score for the Kin-
dle. Next, zooming receives far better score with iPad. A
total of 61% thinks this is very good, in sharp contrast to
only 4% giving the same score for the Kindle. Taking notes
and highlighting text are two very important needs students
have when studying. As for the possibility of taking notes,
this was categorized as either good or very good by 28%
using the iPad. Only 7% answered with these categories
when using the Kindle. Highlighting text also received bet-
ter scores with the iPad, 32% of iPad users finding this fea-
ture good or very good versus only 11% with the Kindle.
Last, the reading devices did not score very differently as
regards reading books, but for reading articles 92% of the
iPad users found this to be either good or very good in con-
trast to 72% saying the same about the Kindle. We also
observe the iPad is more of an entertainment device in com-
parison with the Kindle, but this should not be a surprise to
anyone familiar with these devices.
The above-mentioned features seem to be the areas where
the iPad is ahead of the Kindle. The remaining features pres-
ent so little variation that it would only be of interest if a
larger sample was surveyed.
Learning Outcomes. Only 4% of the students participating in
the project thought they had a better learning outcome using
the e-reader for studying. But 46% thought they had learned
about the same, and as many as 41% stated they had learned
less well using the e-reader in comparison with printed text.
Nine percent did not know.
Discussion
Despite the fact that students in general were positive to the
use of e-readers, our research suggests that current e-book
readers loaded with curriculum-based e-books and articles
cannot, to a full extent, provide for an efficient learning
experience in higher education. Students report unsatisfac-
tory aspects of the e-readers in regard to active reading.
Interaction with the texts in the form of comments, highlight-
ing, annotation, and nonlinear reading is difficult. The tech-
nology still seems to be immature for serious study in an
academic setting.
The main results of our study as to student preferences
are still in line with what other investigators have found.
Students of today still seem to prefer print on paper as the
primary delivery mechanism for texts as part of their educa-
tion. The current technological infrastructure as to e-readers
and content is not yet as functional as traditional printed
media. This outcome is also related to work habits and how
familiar the current generation of students is with using
e-readers. Our study reports the subjective viewpoints of the
participating students who were relatively inexperienced
users of e-readers. The courses surveyed were all in the
humanities and social sciences; results might have been dif-
ferent if students from the natural sciences, medicine, or
mathematics had been included in the study.
Due to student preferences and uncertainty as to learning
outcomes, the field is still in a state of flux. The major pub-
lishers of academic textbooks have still not embraced e-read-
ers. Universities and academic libraries should possibly
moderate plans and projects for a transition to e-texts and
continue studying current e-book readers.
In this study, the iPad received better scores than
Kindle DX as to taking notes and highlighting. The stu-
dents also reported that they brought the iPad to class.
This might point to this device's potential as an effective
study and reading tool, and should be more thoroughly
investigated.
Recent developments in smartphone technology are also
of great interest. The widespread adoption of smartphones
with large screens, powerful processors, and a sophisticated
software environment means that most students will already
have a device that could be a suitable tool for academic
study. An added advantage of smartphones as a learning tool
is that students already know how to use them. A new study
focusing on these ubiquitous devices would be of great
interest.
