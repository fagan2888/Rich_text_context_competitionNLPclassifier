Dependence Among Community-Living Older Persons

Background.Many older persons who are highly vulnerable do not develop functional dependence, whereas some older
persons with low vulnerability do develop functional dependence. We conducted this study to determine the combined effects
of baseline vulnerability and precipitating events on the development of functional dependence.
Methods. We analyzed data from two prospective, population-based cohort studies. The development cohort included 799
community-living persons, 72 years of age and older, who were independent in their activities of daily living (ADLs). The vali-
dation cohort included 1,051 comparable persons. Participants were classified by baseline vulnerability, defined on the basis of
physical performance, cognitive status, and age, and by exposure to potential precipitating events, determined from information
gathered from acute care hospital admissions. The primary outcome was the onset of functional dependence, defined as a new
disability in one or more of the seven ADLs at the l-year follow-up interview or admission to a skilled nursing facility prior to
the l-year interview.
Results. Functional dependence developed in 109 (13.6%) participants in the development cohort and in 100 (9.3%) partici-
pants in the validation cohort. The rates of functional dependence for the low, intermediate, and high vulnerability groups were
7.1%,17.2%, and 40.1 % (p<.ool) in the development cohort and 4.8%,15.0%, and 28.0% (p<.ool) in the validation cohort.
For the four categories (none, mild, moderate, severe) of precipitating events, the rates of functional dependence were 9.0%,
19.4%,27.3%, and 53.2% (p<.ool) in the development cohort and 5.1%,12.0%,28.2%, and 53.3% (p<..ool) in the validation
cohort. For both cohorts, when baseline vulnerability and precipitating events were analyzed in cross-stratified format, the rate
of functional dependence increased progressively from low-risk to high-risk groups in all directions (double-gradient phe-
nomenon). The contributions of baseline vulnerability and precipitating events to the development of functional dependence
were independent and statistically significant.
Conclusions. Among community-living older persons, baseline vulnerability and precipitating hospital events contribute in-
dependently to the development of functional dependence and should each be targeted for intervention when developing strate-
gies aimed at forestalling the onset of functional dependence.
MAINTAINING independent function is a primary goal of
health care for older persons (1). To achieve this goal,
clinicians caring for older persons need to know not only who is
at risk for becoming dependent, but also why dependence devel-
ops among those who are at risk. To date, most published re-
ports of functional dependence have focused on evaluating base-
line risk (or vulnerability). Large epidemiologic studies, for
example, have identified several demographic and health-related
risk factors for functional dependence (2-5). More recently, in-
vestigators have focused on the effects of impairments in do-
mains relevant to functioning. Guralnik and associates (6) have
shown that objective measures of lower-extremity function are
highly predictive ofboth decline in mobility and new disability
in activities of daily living (ADLs) among community-living
older persons. Gill and coworkers have demonstrated, further-
more, that poor performance on tests of physical capability is
strongly associated with the onset ofADL disability in older
persons with (7) and without (8) cognitive impairment, and that
impairments in physical performance and cognitive status con-
tribute independently to the risk ofADL disability (9).
Attention to baseline vulnerability alone, however, does not
fully explain why older persons develop functional dependence.
A sizable number of vulnerable elders, for example, do not de-
velop functional dependence, and many elders who develop
functional dependence have low vulnerability (6-9). These
findings should not be surprising. While physical and cognitive
impairments may make one vulnerable to events that precipi-
tate functional dependence (l0,11), they do not cause or precip-
itate functional dependence themselves.
In contrast to the accumulating body of knowledge concern-
ing risk factors for functional dependence, relatively little is
known about the events, other than catastrophic events such as
a stroke or hip fracture, that actually precipitate functional de-
pendence; and nothing is known about the interplay of baseline
vulnerability and precipitating events on the development of
functional dependence. These gaps in our knowledge base must
be filled if we are to better understand the disabling process and
to develop effective and efficient strategies to prevent or slow
functional decline.
The objective of this study was to determine the combined
effects of baseline vulnerability and precipitating events on the
development of functional dependence. We postulated that
functional dependence, like delirium (12) and injurious falls
(13), involves a complex interrelationship between baseline
vulnerability and precipitating events, such that older persons
who are highly vulnerable may develop functional dependence

with any precipitating event, even of mild severity. Conversely,
older persons with low vulnerability will require a noxious in-
sult or major event before they develop functional dependence.
As potential precipitating events, we focused on acute care hos-
pital admissions because their occurrence is readily identifiable
and they often lead to new or worsening functional dependence
in older persons (14). We developed and tested our model offunc-
tional dependence in two independent cohorts of community-
living older persons.
MErnODS
Development Study
Subjects.-Potential participants in the development study were
members ofProject Safety, a probability sample of community-
living persons, age 72 years and older, living in New Haven,
Connecticut, in 1989. The sampling technique has been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (15). Fourteen hundred thirty-six
persons were originally contacted. Only 44 (3%) failed to meet
the three eligibility criteria, which included the ability to speak
English, Spanish, or Italian; to follow simple commands; and to
walk across a room without the assistance of another person.
The 1,103 (79%) persons who agreed to participate underwent
a comprehensive assessment in their homes by a trained re-
search nurse using standard instruments.
Participants for the current study included the 933 members
who (a) were independent at baseline (requiring no personal as-
sistance) in seven ADLs: bathing, dressing, transferring from
bed to chair, walking, eating, toileting, and grooming; and (b)
had complete data on baseline vulnerability. Among those eligi-
ble, 38 had died and 96 had missing outcome data, leaving 799
participants in the development cohort. Compared with those in
the development cohort, persons who died or who had missing
outcome data were similar in age, gender, education, marital
status, and number of chronic conditions.

Baseline vulnerability.-To assess baseline vulnerability, we
focused on three factors-physical performance, cognitive status,
and age-that have been shown in previous studies to be most
strongly associated with the development of functional depen-
dence (7-9,16) and that were also available for analysis in the
validation cohort. Physical performance was assessed with the
rapid gait test. Participants were asked to walk back and forth
over a 10-foot course "as quickly as possible," thus testing maxi-
mum speed ofperformance. Scores were dichotomized at 10 sec-
onds, based on our previous work demonstrating a threshold re-
sponse (at the worst quartile) between rapid gait scores and the
development of functional dependence (7,8). Cognitive status
was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE;
(17)]. Scores were dichotomized at 24 to distinguish participants

who werecognitivelyimpaired from those who were cognitively
intact (17).Age was dichotomized at 85 years to distinguish the
old-oldfrom the young-old (16).Differentcombinationsof these
three dichotomousfactors were subsequentlyevaluated.The se-
lection of the final vulnerability model, shown in Table 1, was
guided by two basic principles.First,the strategyshould identify
participantsat low,intermediate,and high risk for functional de-
pendence;and second,the strategyshouldidentifya sizablenum-
ber of participantsin each of the three risk groups to ensure that
the combined effects of baseline vulnerability and precipitating
events could be adequately evaluated.The risk of functional de-
pendence among participants who scored 10 seconds or less on
rapid gaitwas low regardlessof the participants'MMSE scoreor
age.Alternative cutpointsfor the MMSE and age were evaluated
but did not improveupon the finalvulnerability model.
Precipitatingevents.-Information on precipitating eventswas
gathered from acute care hospital admissions.These admissions
wereidentified duringthe l-year follow-up periodfromthree com-
plementary sources: extractedhospitaldischarge records, datatapes
from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), and a
computerized database attheVeteransAffairs (VA) MedicalCenter
in WestHaven,Connecticut Hospitaldischargerecordswere sur-
veyedon a continuous basisat thetwoacutecarehospitalsin New
Haven.Thesetwohospitals accountforover90% of acutecaread-
missionsfor personslivingin New Haven.For each admission,a
shortextractionform was completed,whichincludedinformation
on hospital, date of admission and discharge, major procedures,
and principal diagnoses at discharge, coded according to the
International Classification ofDiseases, 9th Revision, Clinical
Modification. Comparableinformationon admissions to hospitals
within and outside of New Haven was obtained from the HCFA
data tapes.These admissionshad beenidentifiedpreviouslyusing
a set of matching algorithms described in an earlier report (18).
Finally, forparticipants who indicatedthattheyhad been hospital-
ized at the VAMedical Center, we searched the Decentralized
HospitalComputerProgram(DHCP)databaseforadmissions dur-
ing the follow-up period and extracted information on length of
stay, majorprocedures, andprincipal diagnoses atdischarge.
Toclassifyprecipitatingevents,we used information on prin-
cipal diagnoses at discharge, major procedures, and length of
stay, an important marker of illness severity (16). Precipitating
events were classified as none when there were no hospital ad-
missions or, otherwise, as mild, moderate, or severe based on
the criteria shown in Table 2. These criteria were developed a
priori using clinical judgment, but were later validated empiri-
cally as part of the study. None of the criteria denoted a func-
tional outcome. All classifications were made without knowl-
edge of the participants' outcome state.The intrarater reliability
of the classificationscheme was excellent (Kappa=1.0).
Outcome.-Self-reported ADLs were reassessed during a
follow-up interview in the home at one year. When available,
proxy responses were used for participants who were unable to
complete this assessment (0.8%).Admissions to skilled nursing
facilitieswere ascertainedfrom two sources:(a) the Connecticut
Long Term Care Registry, using a previously described match-
ing procedure (19); and (b) the HCFAdata tapes, which provide
information on Medicare-reimbursed admissions to facilities
within and outside of Connecticut. The outcome was the onset
of functional dependence, defined as a new disability (unable to
perform or require personal assistance) in one or more of the
seven ADLs at the l-year interview or admission to a skilled
nursingfacilityprior to the l-year interview.
ValidationStudy
Subjects.-Potential participantsin the validation study were
membersof theNewHavensiteof theEstablishedPopulations for
Epidemiologic Studiesof theElderly(EPESE)program. Thispro-
gramwasestablishedin 1982as a longitudinal, community-based

usedforonly a smaIl proportion ofparticipants (3.9%).
Statistical Analysis
In bivariate analysis, ratesof functional dependencewerecal-
culatedforcategories of baselinevulnerability and precipitating
events. Becausesome participants had more than one hospital
admission during the follow-up period,rates of functional de-
pendencefor precipitating eventswerecalculatedseparatelyfor
the firsthospitaladmission,the mostseverehospitaladmission,
and the last hospital admission. Results for these three ap-
proaches werecomparable. In this report, resultsare presented
onlyfor the mostseverehospitaladmission. Next,the combined
effectsof baselinevulnerabilityand precipitatingeventson the
developmentof functional dependence were assessed using a
cross-stratification technique(9,13)thatcategorizes participants
by levels of bothbaselinevulnerability andprecipitating events.
The Mantel-Haenszel chi-squarestatistic was used to test for
linearassociations, firstfor baseline vulnerability and precipitat-
ing eventsalone, and then for precipitatingevents within cate-

gories of baseline vulnerability and for baseline vulnerability
withincategoriesof precipitating events.Toassessthe indepen-
dent effects of baseline vulnerability and precipitatingevents,
two binomial regression models were developed(22).Model I
included only baseline vulnerability and precipitating events;
Model 2 included baseline vulnerability, precipitatingevents,
and several other baselinecharacteristics listed in Table3. For
each model, a logarithmiclink function was specified,and ad-
justed relative risks and Wald95% confidence intervals were
calculated. Baselinevulnerability and precipitating eventswere
treated as categorical variables, with low vulnerabilityand no
eventserving as the referencegroups, respectively. Toaccount
for participantswithmissingdata, an indicatorvariablewas in-
cluded for body mass index, the only baseline characteristic
withmore than I% missingdata.
A comparable set of analyses was performed for the valida-
tion cohort. All analyses were carried out using SAS Version
6.12(SASInstitute, Cary, NC) software.

Validation Cohort
validation cohort were slightly younger, were more likely to be
married, but were less likely to be female, white, and to live in
private, age-restricted housing. Otherwise, years of education,
number of chronic conditions, body mass index, MMSE scores,
and baseline vulnerability were comparable in the two cohorts.
The rates of functional dependence for the low, intermediate,
and high vulnerability groups were 37/768 (4.8%), 21/130
(15.0%), and 40/143 (28.0%), respectively (X2 test of linear
trend=82.3;p<.OOl),and for the four categories(none,mild, mod-
erate, severe) ofprecipitating events were 44/868 (5.1%), 10/83
(12.0%), 22/78 (28.2%), and 24/45 (53.3%) (X2 test of linear
trend=141.9;p<.OOl). When the combined effectsof baselinevul-
nerabilityand precipitatingeventswere evaluated(Figure 1B),the
"double-gradient" phenomenon was again observed (with only
one exception), replicating the results from the development co-
hort. The independent contributions of baseline vulnerability and
precipitatingevents were confirmed in both multivariablemodels
(Table4, bottom panel).There was a marginalinteractionbetween
baselinevulnerabilityand precipitatingeventsin Modell (p =.08),
but no interactioninModel 2 (p =.74).
The rates of functional dependence for the low, intermediate,
and high vulnerability groups were 41/574 (7.1%), 17/99
(17.2%), and 51/126 (40.1 %), respectively (X2 test of linear
trend=95.3;p<.001), representing a 5.7-fold increased risk for
functional dependence between the low and high vulnerability
groups. For the four categories (none, mild, moderate, severe)
of precipitating events, the rates of functional dependence were
57/635 (9.0%), 12/62 (19.4%), 15/55 (27.3%), and 25/47
(53.2%; X2 test of linear trend=80.4; p<.OOl), representing a
5.9-fold increased risk for functional dependence between the
none and severe groups.
The combined effects of baseline vulnerability and precipitat-
ing events on the development of functional dependence are
shown in Figure 1A.With only two exceptions, the rate offunc-
tional dependence increased progressively from low-risk to
high-risk groups in all directions (i.e., across rows, across
columns, or diagonally). This "double-gradient" phenomenon
suggests that both baseline vulnerability and precipitatn,Ig events
contribute independently to the development of functional de-
pendence. As hypothesized, participants with low vulner~bility
were unlikely to develop functional dependence except III the
setting of a severe precipitating event (33.3% [severe] vs 5.9%
[none, mild and moderate groups combined]; p<.OOl).
Moreover, among participants with high vulnerability, those
without a precipitating event were considerably less likely to de-
velop functional dependence than were those with a precipit~t
ing event (28.3% [absent] vs 73.5% [present]; p<.OOl). Despite
this diminished risk, however, participants with high vulnerabil-
ity but no precipitating event had a similar likelihood of devel-
oping functional dependence as participants with low vulnera-
bility who had a severe precipitating event (28.3% vs 33.3%).
Shown in Table 4 (top panel) are the relative risks and 95%
confidence intervals relating the categories of baseline vulnera-
bility and precipitating events to functional dependence. The
risk of functional dependence increased across categories of
both baseline vulnerability and precipitating events, independent
of the effect of the other (Modell), confirming the results of the
unadjusted analyses. Comparable results were found for Model
2, which adjusted for baseline vulnerability or precipitating
events, where appropriate, as well as for age, gender, race, edu-
cation, marital status, housing type, number of chronic condi-
tions, and body mass index. There was a marginal inter~ction
between baseline vulnerability and precipitating events III the
two multivariablemodels (Modell, p =.07; Model 2, p =.16).
Validation Study
Of the 1,051 participants in the validation cohort, 25 were
admitted to a skilled nursing facility and 73 were found to have
ADL disability at the follow-up interview, giving an outcome
rate of 9.3%. There were 280 acute care hospital admissions
during the follow-up period. Two hundred twelve (75.7%) ad-
missions were ascertained by both local surveillance and HCFA
data tapes, 19 (6.8%) admissions were ascertained by local
surveillance alone, 37 (13.2%) admissions were ascertained by
HCFA data tapes alone, and 15 (5.4%) admissions were ascer-
tained through the West Haven VA's DHCP database. Of the
205 participants hospitalized during the follow-up period, 154
were hospitalized once, 36 were hospitalized twice, and 15
were hospitalized three or more times. Compared with partici-
pants in the development cohort (Table 3), participants in the

velopment of functional dependence.We also found that older
persons with low vulnerability are unlikely to develop func-
tionaldependenceexcept in the settingof a severeprecipitating
event, whereas older persons who are highly vulnerable may
develop functional dependence with any precipitating event,
even of mild severity. These findings indicate that clinicians
and investigators need to considerthe combinedeffectsof base-
line vulnerabilityand precipitatingevents when characterizing
the mechanisms or pathways by which older persons develop
functional dependence. Our model of precipitating events su-
perimposed upon predisposing impairments has now been
shownto operatein delirium(12),injuriousfalls (13), and func-
tional dependence and may offer investigatorsa valuable vehi-
cle to study other geriatric syndromes, such as urinary inconti-
nence,pressuresores,and adversedrivingevents.
Our results provide empirical evidence to support other
relatedmodelsof disabilityand frailty(23-25). In his textbook,
Brocklehurst (23) postulated that many frail, older persons
manage to remainin the communityby balancingassets, which
maintain independence, with deficits,which threaten indepen-
dence;and that "breakdown"occurseitherby the additionof an
acuteor subacutemedical problemto the deficitside of the bal-
ance or by the loss of social support from the asset side of the
balance.Rockwood and associates(24) extended this model to
describe a more dynamic process in which perturbations in as-
sets and deficits lead to changes in functional status. Finally,
Campbell and Buchner (25) proposed that disability may arise
from a single catastrophic event, such as a stroke or traumatic
amputation, in an otherwise robust individual, or from small
precipitants,such as a change in drug therapy,cold weather,or
an attackof bronchitis,in a frailolderperson.
Our model of baseline vulnerability included physical per-
formance, cognitive status, and age. Impairments in physical
performance and cognitive status are two of the main determi-
nants of preclinical disability (7-9), a postulated state of com-
promisedfunctionthat may not be evidentclinically(11).Other
investigatorshave suggested that impairmentsin key domains,
such as physical performance and cognitive status, act to de-
pletephysiologicreserve,therebyleavingolderpersons vulner-
able to previously innocuous insults or challenges (10).
Although age is an important risk factor for functional depen-
dence (16), it likely serves, in part, as a proxy for an array of
deleteriousfactors that are unmeasured or difficultto measure.
To dichotomize the three elements of our vulnerability model,
we used commonly accepted (16,17) or empirically derived
(7,8) cutpoints.Although the model stratifiedparticipants into
three distinct risk groups in both the development and valida-
tion cohorts,some misclassification of risk may have occurred.
Scores below 24 on the MMSE, for example, may reflect low
educational attainment rather than cognitive impairment (26).
Furthermore, despite advanced age, some elderly persons re-
main remarkably robust (27). If present, misclassification of
risk would have weakened our results by placing less vulnera-
ble participants withthose who weremore vulnerable.
To classify precipitating events, we used information on a
combinationof hospital-relatedfactors,includingprincipaldis-
charge diagnosis, major procedures, and length of stay. With
few exceptions, the magnitudeof an eventcannot be adequately
determined from a diagnosis alone. Moreover, because many
older personsare susceptibleto othercomplicationsnot directly
relatedto the illnessor injuryfor which they were hospitalized,
functional decline often cannot be attributedto the acute prob-
lem leading to hospitalization(28). Length of stay,a key com-
ponent of our criteria,has been shown in previousstudiesto be
an important markerof illnessseverity(16). Of note, our classi-
fication scheme was found to be reliable and created clinically
meaningfuland statistically significantrisk gradientsacross the
four categoriesof precipitating eventsfor both the development
and validationcohorts.
Previous studies of functional dependence have focused
largely on baseline vulnerability (2-9). The role of specific
events on the development of functional dependence has been
less well characterized.One cross-sectionalstudy reported that
arthritis, injury,stroke,heart disease,and pain injoints were the
most common diseases and symptoms attributedby older per-
sons to difficultywithADL function (29).A prospectivecohort
study found that a substantialproportion of older persons were
hospitalizedwith one of a smallnumber of common diagnoses,
including stroke, hip fracture, congestive heart failure, and
pneumonia,duringthe year theybecame severely disabled(30).
By evaluating the combined effects of baseline vulnerability
and precipitatingevents,our studybuilds upon thisearlierwork
and, in turn, advancesour understandingof how functional de-
pendencedevelopsamongcommunity-living olderpersons.
Strengths of the current study include the use of three com-
plementary sources to ensure the complete ascertainment of
hospital admissions, and the availability of high-quality data
from two large, population-basedcohorts of community-living
older persons, which allowed us to develop and validate our
model in independent samples. Despite some notable differ-
ences in baseline characteristics between the two cohorts, our
model of baseline vulnerability and precipitatingeventscreated
distinct and statisticallysignificantrisk gradientsin the valida-
tion cohort, with a 26.7-fold increased risk for functional de-
pendencebetweenthe low-andhigh-riskgroups.
Several limitations, however, warrant discussion. First, al-
thoughwe had information on most majorhealthevents, we had
no information on healtheventsthat did not lead to hospitaliza-
tion (e.g., a prolonged upper respiratory tract infection) or on
"nonhealth"events(e.g.,the deathof a familymember).Of par-
ticipants who developedfunctionaldependencein the develop-
ment and validation cohorts,52% and 45%, respectively, didnot
havean acute hospitaladmission,suggestingthatfunctionalde-
pendence in older persons is often insidious (11) or is precipi-
tated by less potent health events or by nonhealth events.
Second, in the validation cohort, information on self-reported
ADLs was collectedduringa face-to-face assessment at baseline
and a telephone interviewat 1year.A recent reporthas demon-
stratedthat the prevalence ofADL disabilitymay differdepend-
ing on the mode of datacollection (31).Third,someparticipants
may have developed ADL disability and then recovered their
ADL function prior to the l-year interview. Previous studies
have reported that up to 30% of disabled, community-living
older persons recovertheirADL function within2 years (1,32).
Fourth,we had no informationon whetherparticipants received
interventions aimedat maintaining or restoringfunctional ability
after a precipitating event. Finally, we cannot determine from
our data how often a single process, such as congestive heart
failureor rheumatoid arthritis,underlies both vulnerabilityand
the eventsthat precipitatefunctionaldependence.These limita-
DEVELOPMENTOF FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE M383
tions can best be addressed with a prospective cohort study de-
signed specifically to determine the mechanisms of disability
and recovery among community-living older persons.
Despite these limitations, our results suggest potential strate-
gies that may be aimed at forestalling the onset of functional
dependence among older persons. One strategy, for example,
might be to decrease vulnerability among the most vulnerable
elders, perhaps by improving physical capabilities through an
exercise-based intervention (33). A second, complementary
strategy might be to prevent (34) or aggressively treat (35) the
precipitating events themselves. Yet, a third strategy might
focus on preventing functional decline among hospitalized el-
ders, perhaps through the use of specially designed acute care
units (36). Furtherresearch is needed to identify the specific
events that precipitate functional dependence among older per-
sons and to determine whether these events differ among per-
sons with different levels of baseline vulnerability.
