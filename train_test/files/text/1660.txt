Introduction
An increased amount of abdominal fat may underlie the
increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with
overall obesity (reflected by BMI) (1,2). BMI is a poor indi-
cator of body fat distribution (3), and as such, measures of
abdominal adiposity have shown strong and positive associa-
tions with numerous adverse health outcomes, including risk
of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (4,5). Whether
abdominal adiposity or body fat distribution is more strongly
predictive of mortality than overall obesity has been a topic
of frequent interest; however, results of these investigations
have varied considerably (6­14). Notable limitations of these
studies include reliance on self-report of anthropomet
ry or
lack of representation of the general population. In 
addition,
comparison of risks between sexes and age groups has often
been difficult since many studies included only men or
women or have had restricted age variation.
Examining the influence of age on the relation between
adiposity and mortality is important, since the health effects
of adiposity among older adults are unclear. The increased
risk of mortality observed at the highest levels of BMI has
been shown to diminish with advancing age suggesting that
minimum mortality may occur at a higher BMI among older
adults (15,16). Furthermore, studies of older adults, especially
the very old, have reported inverse associations of BMI with
mortality (7,9,17). Yet, clinical guidelines for optimal body
weight do not differ between middle-aged and older adults
(18). Because aging is associated with an increased accumu-
lation of central fat (19), some investigators have suggested
that measures of abdominal adiposity or body fat distribu-
tion, as opposed to BMI, should be used to evaluate mortal-
ity risk among the elderly (20). Whether abdominal adiposity
increases risk of mortality among older adults is unknown
since studies have been equivocal, and those that have found
a positive association report only a modest elevation in risk at
the highest levels of central obesity (7,9­12). The objective of
the current study was to compare the relative importance and
joint association of overall obesity and abdominal adiposity or
body fat distribution with risk of total and cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality among a nationally representative sample of US

Results of studies comparing overall obesity and abdominal adiposity or body fat distribution with risk of
mortality have varied considerably. We compared the relative importance and joint association of overall obesity
and body fat distribution in predicting risk of mortality. Participants included 5,799 men and 6,429 women aged
30­102 years enrolled in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who completed a baseline health
examination during 1988­1994. During a 12-year follow-up (102,172 person-years), 1,188 men and 925 women died.
In multivariable-adjusted analyses, waist-to-thigh ratio (WTR) in both sexes (P
trend
<0.01 for both) and waist-to-hip
ratio (WHR) in women (P
trend
0.001) were positively associated with mortality in middle-aged adults (30­64 years),
while BMI and waist circumference (WC) exhibited U- or J-shaped associations. Risk of mortality increased with
a higher WHR and WTR among normal weight (BMI 18.5­24.9kg/m2) and obese (BMI 30.0kg/m2) adults. In older
adults (65­102 years), a higher BMI in both sexes (P
trend
<0.05) and WC in men (P
trend
0.001) were associated with
increased survival, while remaining measures of body fat distribution exhibited either no association or an inverse
relation with mortality. In conclusion, ratio measures of body fat distribution are strongly and positively associated
with mortality and offer additional prognostic information beyond BMI and WC in middle-aged adults. A higher
BMI in both sexes and WC in men were associated with increased survival in older adults, while a higher WHR
or WTR either decreased or did not influence risk of death.

adults. We further sought to examine the influence of sex and
age on these associations.
Methods and Procedures
The third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III)
The current study utilized data from NHANES III conducted in the
United States from 1988­1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
NHANES III included a national, complex multistage, clustered, strati-
fied probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population
aged 2 months and older. Data collection occurred during a home
interview and a health examination conducted in a mobile examina-
tion center. The Institutional Review Board at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention approved the study design and all participants
provided written informed consent.
A total of 13,065 adults aged 30­102 years completed a physical exami-
nation as part of NHANES III. We excluded pregnant women (n = 70)
and individuals who were missing information regarding height (n = 25),
weight (n = 17), or circumference measurements (n = 718). Persons who
refused to provide sufficient personal identifying information were also
excluded since they were ineligible for vital status follow-up (n = 7). The
remaining 12,228 adults (5,799 men and 6,429 women) were eligible for
mortality follow-up.
Baseline measurements
Race/ethnicity was self-reported and categorized as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic African American, Mexican American, and
other. Education was classified as less than high school, high school,
some college, or college. Current, former, or never smoking was
based on the use of cigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco. Individuals
who smoked at least 100 cigarettes, 20 cigars, or 20 pipes of tobacco
in their lifetime but no longer smoked were considered former
smokers. The consumption frequency of alcoholic beverages (beer,
wine, liquor) and the type and frequency of leisure-time physi-
cal activities over the past month were assessed. Heart disease
included angina, a physician's diagnosis of congestive heart failure,
or 
myocardial infarction. Angina was determined with a series of
questions described elsewhere (21). A history of physician diag-
nosed respiratory disease (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or
asthma), cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), or stroke was
also queried.
Body weight to the nearest 0.1kg and standing height to the nearest
0.1cm were measured using a Toledo electronic scale and Seca sta-
diometer. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters. Trained technicians measured circumfer-
ence measures to the nearest 0.1cm using a steel measuring tape. Waist
was measured level with the iliac crest at the end of a normal expiration.
Hip was measured at the widest circumference around the buttocks.
Thigh was measured at the midthigh of the right leg with the right knee
slightly flexed and both feet flat on the floor. BMI exposure groups
were based on standard clinical definitions: underweight, <18.5; 
normal
weight, 18.5­24.9; overweight, 25.0­29.9; obese class I, 30.0­34.9; and
obese class II and III, 35.0. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-
to-thigh ratio (WTR) were calculated, and along with waist circumfer-
ence (WC) alone were classified into sex-specific quintiles and tertiles,
by using cutting points defined by the weighted sex-specific distribution
of these variables in the sample population.
Hypertension was defined as the average of a maximum of six
seated blood pressure readings by a trained technician or physician
140/90mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes was
defined by history (type 1 or type 2), use of diabetes medications, or
a fasting plasma glucose level 126mg/dL. High cholesterol included
a total cholesterol concentration 240mg/dL or use of lipid lowering
medication. Hormone replacement therapy use in women was based
on self-report and defined as current or not current use.
Ascertainment of mortality
We merged baseline data from NHANES III with follow-up data
from the NHANES III Mortality Study. As part of the NHANES III
Mortality Study, data from the National Death Index, which has been
shown to capture 93­98% of all US deaths (22), were used to ascertain
the vital status of each cohort member through December 31, 2000.
Information obtained from the Mortality Study data included the
month, day, and year in which a person was last known to be alive and
underlying cause of death according to International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes before 1999 and International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes (in brackets) during
1999­2000. Because our interests were in the health effects of adi-
posity, we chose not to include deaths attributed to external causes
(e.g., accidents, homicides, poisoning; 81 deaths), including codes
E800­E999 (V01-Y98) in our analyses of total deaths. Cardiovascular
disease deaths included codes 390­448 (I00-I99).
Statistical analyses
All analyses were weighted to the US population to provide nation-
ally representative estimates. SAS-callable SUDAAN statistical soft-
ware, release 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) was used to account for the complex survey design, a stratified
multistage cluster sample (23). We computed length of follow-up as
the time elapsed between the health examination and the date of death
for decedents and December 31, 2000, for survivors. Multivariable
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the
relation of adiposity with mortality after adjustment for potential con-
founders. We did not adjust for physical activity or possible mediators
of obesity effects, such as diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol,
since doing so would have resulted in overadjustment because of their
position on the causal pathway (24). Adjustment for estrogen use in
women had very little, if any, effect on the associations of adiposity with
mortality and was therefore not included. Linear trends were exam-
ined with the inclusion of adiposity as an ordinal variable within the
multivariable models. Models including BMI and WC in middle-aged
adults also were fitted with BMI and WC squared to assess nonlinearity.
Multiplicative interaction terms between age (30­64 and 65­102 years)
and adiposity as well as sex and adiposity in age-stratified models were
tested. Compliance with the assumption of proportional hazards was
assured by testing time dependent covariates within age-stratified

models. All tests of hypotheses were based on a type I error rate of 0.05
using 2-sided tests.
Results
Overall, mean age of men at baseline was 54.6 years (s.e., 0.2)
and 53.8 years (s.e., 0.2) for women (range 30­102 years).
Proportions of men who were white, African American, and
Mexican American were 79.1, 9.4, and 4.4%, respectively, and
78.2, 10.6, and 3.8% among women. During a maximum of
12 years of follow-up (102,172 person-years), 1,188 men (417
from cardiovascular disease) and 925 women died (319 from
cardiovascular disease). In general, decedents were older,
less educated, less physically active, more likely to have been
a 
current smoker, and to have existing disease, hypertension,
and diabetes at baseline (Table 1). Men who died had a lower
thigh circumference and greater WTR at baseline than men
who survived, while women who died had a greater WC,
WHR, and WTR, and a lower thigh circumference.
Table 2 shows the relation of adiposity with total 
mortality
differed significantly between middle-aged and older adults.
In middle-aged adults, U- and J-shaped associations of
BMI with mortality in men and women, respectively, were

observed. There was a U-shaped association between WC
alone and mortality in middle-aged men, whereas a nonsig-
nificant positive association was observed in middle-aged
women. Quadratic terms for BMI and WC in middle-aged
men and women were nonsignificant (P
quadratic
>0.05 for all).
In contrast, graded hazard ratios of mortality across incre-
mental quintiles of WTR in both sexes (P
trend
0.004 in middle-
aged men and 0.005 in middle-aged women) and WHR in
middle-aged women (P
trend
0.001) were noted. In older adults,
risk of mortality decreased significantly with a higher BMI,
WC, and WHR in men (P
trend
0.008, 0.001, and 0.009, respec-
tively). In older women, BMI was inversely associated with
mortality (P
trend
0.04). There was no evidence to suggest that
the association of adiposity with mortality differed by sex
in middle-aged or older adults (P
interaction
>0.05 for all). The
strength and shape of the relation of each measure of adi-
posity with mortality was unchanged when excluding indi-
viduals who died within the first 5 years of follow-up (n =
1,045), except for the association between WHR and mortal-
ity in middle-aged men. This relation became statistically sig-
nificant; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) according
to incremental quintiles of WHR were 1.00 (referent), 3.70
(1.23, 11.11), 2.28 (0.72, 7.21), 3.10 (0.95, 10.10), and 6.16
(2.12, 20.55); P
trend
0.005.
The relation of adiposity with cardiovascular disease mortal-
ity also differed significantly between middle-aged and older
adults for all measures in men and WC in women (Table 3).
Among middle-aged men and women, J-shaped associations
of BMI with mortality were observed. Cardiovascular 
mortality
was 2.8- and 3.2-fold higher across quintiles of WC in middle-
aged men and women, respectively; 5.4- and 4.1-fold across
quintiles of WHR; and 4.7- and 2.0-fold across quintiles of
WTR. In older adults, the highest levels of BMI and abdominal
adiposity or body fat distribution generally 
carried a 
hazard
ratio of <1 of dying from cardiovascular disease, except for
WHR and WTR in women, where nonsignificant hazard
ratios >1 were observed.
We also determined the combined association of BMI
and WHR (and WTR) with total and cardiovascular dis-
ease 
mortality while concurrently adjusting for each meas-
ure. These individual relations were virtually unaffected by
simultaneous adjustment among men and women in both
age groups (not shown). In addition, we examined joint asso-
ciations with total mortality by classifying individuals sepa-
rately by age group, BMI and sex-specific tertiles of WHR,
and WTR. To preserve sample size and numbers of deaths
withineachadipositystratum,wecombinedmenandwomen.

in each stratum of BMI, though this association was most
evident for normal weight and obese adults. Risk of mor-
tality was variable across tertiles of WHR and WTR among
normal weight, overweight, and obese older adults (Figures
2a,b). Due to a strong correlation between BMI and WC
(r = 0.88), we were unable to examine their joint association
with mortality.

Discussion
In this 12-year prospective cohort study in a large probability
sample of US adults, ratio measures of abdominal adiposity or
body fat distribution, particularly WHR in women and WTR
in both sexes, were strongly and positively associated with
risk of total mortality in middle-aged adults. The association
persisted after adjustment for overall obesity (reflected by BMI).
Furthermore, risk of mortality increased progressively with
a higher WHR and WTR among normal weight and obese

middle-aged adults, while BMI and WC alone were associ-
ated with mortality in a U- or J-shaped fashion. In older adults,
a higher BMI in both sexes, and WC and WHR in men were

associated with increased survival. The highest levels of abdomi-
nal adiposity in older adults did not significantly increase risk
of 
mortality. Among both age groups, these findings were unaf-
fected by increased early mortality among the leanest adults.
For simplicity, clinical guidelines recommend assessing over-
all obesity and abdominal adiposity via BMI and WC, respec-
tively (18). The use of WC alone or in combination with hip or
thigh circumferences to reflect abdominal adiposity remains a
controversial topic (18,25). The strong correlation of WC with
BMI (r = 0.88) suggests that WC alone is not only an indicator
of abdominal adiposity but also overall obesity, whereas WHR
and WTR correlate less strongly with BMI and therefore may
provide more unique information regarding regional fat distri-
bution. In the current study, WTR in both sexes and WHR in
womenstronglypredictedmortalityamongmiddle-agedadults,
findings similar to data from several large cohorts, including the
Iowa Women's Health Study (8), the Nurses' Health Study (26),
and the Shanghai Women's Health Study (14). The strength
of these associations may be at least partly due to the finding
that waist and hip (and thigh) circumferences display inde-
pendent and opposite associations with cardiovascular disease
risk 
factors and mortality, and related conditions, after mutual
adjustment or correction for overall obesity (4,27­29). WC
largely represents variability in intraabdominal and subcutane-
ous fat, while variability in hip circumference represents dif-
ferences in subcutaneous fat, gluteal muscle, and pelvic width.
Thigh circumference reflects variability in subcutaneous fat
and muscle, and bone width likely to a lesser extent than hip
circumference. The combination of waist with hip or thigh cir-
cumference may provide unique prognostic information about
these two very different but important body sites.

Ratio measures of abdominal adiposity or body fat distri-
bution have been criticized due to their somewhat complex
biologic interpretation, poorer test­retest and intraobserver
reliability than the measurement of WC alone, even though
intra-class correlation coefficients for both measures have been
0.97 (30), and the finding that successful weight loss inter-
ventions commonly reduce the numerator and denominator
resulting in no observed change in the ratio (31). An increased
WHR or WTR may reflect a relative abundance of visceral fat,
decreased peripheral fat or muscle, or both. Alternatively, a
low WHR or WTR may reflect a relative lack of visceral fat,
increased muscle or peripheral fat, or some combination.
Furthermore, WC alone has been shown to be more highly cor-
related with visceral fat than WHR and WTR (3,32). However,
WC has not always been shown to be more strongly associ-
ated with type 2 diabetes (28,33), cardiovascular disease (5,34),
or mortality (5,8,12,13) than WHR. Therefore, it is clear that
WHR and WTR do not reflect variation in visceral fat accumu-
lation only, but they provide an estimate of body shape or fat
distribution, which in the current study was strongly predic-
tive of mortality in middle-aged adults.
Similar to previous studies (15,35), we found the relation
between adiposity and mortality in older adults was differ-
ent than the relation observed in middle-aged adults, regard-
less of the measure of adiposity. Although numerous studies
have examined the association of BMI with mortality, few
have included the very old or additional measures of body
composition (7). In one of the largest studies conducted to
date comparing various measures of adiposity among non-
institutionalized adults aged 75 years, Price et al. (7) found
that a higher BMI or WC was associated with a reduced
risk of all-cause mortality, while a higher WHR modestly
increased mortality. Additional studies support an inverse
association of BMI with mortality among older adults (9,17).
Taken together, these findings suggest that the long-term risk
of increased mortality should be strongly considered when
examining the short-term benefits of adiposity reduction
among older adults.
To limit the potential for confounding by existing or subclin-
ical disease, which is a particular concern in older adults due
in part to higher levels of comorbidity, we adjusted for clini-
cally manifest disease at baseline and excluded deaths within
the first 5 years of follow-up. Results were similar with and
without the exclusion of these persons. Although this analytic
technique may be effective if the underlying disease causes
rapid weight loss leading to death, reverse causation may still
influence risk of mortality if the course of disease is lengthy
(e.g., chronic respiratory conditions). Regardless, in studies of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that measure
pulmonary function that is likely to be the strongest prognos-
tic indicator of mortality in this patient population, a reduced
BMI has remained an independent predictor of death, high-
lighting the importance of body composition in respiratory
disease prognosis (36).
The divergent relation of adiposity with mortality between
middle-aged and older adults may be due to several reasons.
The protective effects of obesity in older age may outweigh the
potential negative effects. Heavier persons have lower rates of
osteoporosis due likely to greater weight-bearing bone forma-
tion (37). This may reduce the risk of falls and protect older
adults from the acute trauma that can occur as a result of fall-
ing. In addition, obesity may provide energy reserves during
periods of stress, including illness or trauma (38,39). A selec-
tive survival effect may also occur, whereby individuals who
are more susceptible to the adverse health effects of obesity
due to environmental or genetic factors suffer from increased
mortality during middle age, leaving a more resistant over-
weight elderly population. In addition, the divergent relation
may be due in part to a ceiling effect. Absolute risk of mortality
increases with age and among adults aged 90 years or older, for
example, 12-year mortality will be nearly 100%, regardless of
any risk factor level.
There were several strengths of the current study. The exter-
nal validity is strengthened by the nationally representative
sample of civilian noninstitutionalized US adults. In addition,
anthropometric indices were measured by trained technicians
using a standardized protocol as opposed to the reliance on
self-report. Furthermore, we controlled for numerous con-
founding and health factors that may distort the association
between adiposity and mortality. However, there were limi-
tations of the current study. We relied on simple estimates of
anthropometry that are unable to distinguish fat from fat-free
mass. However, these measurements are reliable, quick, and
inexpensive to administer; making their applicability appeal-
ing in practice and large population-based epidemiologic stud-
ies. In addition, we had only a single baseline assessment of
adiposity measurements and other exposures; therefore, we
could not examine whether changes occurred in these vari-
ables during follow-up or whether this may have influenced
the study findings.
In conclusion, we provided evidence on the relative impor-
tance of well-defined measures of overall obesity and abdomi-
nal adiposity or body fat distribution in assessing risk of total
and cardiovascular disease mortality in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of US adults. Despite their limitations, ratio
measures of body fat distribution were strongly and positively
associated with risk of mortality in middle-aged adults. In
addition, WHR and WTR increased prediction of mortality
among normal weight and obese middle-aged adults. Among
the elderly, a higher BMI in both sexes and WC in men were
associated with a lower risk of mortality, while indicators of
body fat distribution increased survival or did not influence
risk of mortality. These results suggest that ratio measures of
body fat distribution carry important information for iden-
tifying middle-aged adults at increased risk of mortality and
therefore should not be abandoned in research or practice. Our
findings also argue for age-specific clinical guidelines regard-
ing optimal body weight or body fat distribution.
