Background
No country is truly exempt from a disaster. History has already
provided examples of what can happen to a community in the
event of a large-scale natural disaster. Factors such as popula-
tion growth and urban development are increasing the risk
faced by populations worldwide. Climate change will increase
the incidence, duration, and severity of hazards of meteoro-
logical origin. The risk of disaster and thus the human conse-
quences is increasing. When disaster strikes, health care
organizations, and particularly their nursing and medical staff,
are a critical element in any disaster response. They provide an
essential service to any community, and hospitals and emer-
gency departments (EDs) are often the first place of call for
people affected by any type of emergency. The nursing work-
force makes up a large part of any health care facility and orga-
nization, and is expected to be able to adapt and function
competently. In addition, nurses may have to adapt at a
moment's notice to events that occur with little or no warning,
and they may be called upon to function effectively in chal-
lenging circumstances for periods of weeks or months and in
contexts where their own community has been affected. The
nature, extent, and speed of recovery in areas impacted by
adverse events such as natural disasters is thus influenced by
the adaptive capacity and resilience of nurses and the health
care organizations they represent.
The aim of the integrative review was to provide an
evidence-based approach and re-conceptualization of ideas
and recommendations for natural disaster preparation, pre-
paredness, and competencies for nurses using an ecological

Exploring the Demands on Nurses
Working in Health Care Facilities During
a Large-Scale Natural Disaster: Often
an Invisible Role Within a Highly Visible
Event
Gillian C. Scrymgeour1, Lindsay Smith2, and Douglas Paton2
Abstract
Nurses are pivotal to an effective societal response to a range of critical events, including disasters. This presents nurses
with many significant and complex challenges that require them to function effectively under highly challenging and stressful
circumstances and often for prolonged periods of time. The exponential growth in the number of disasters means that
knowledge of disaster preparedness and how this knowledge can be implemented to facilitate the development of resilient
and adaptive nurses and health care organizations represents an important adjunct to nurse education, policy development,
and research considerations. Although this topic has and continues to attract attention in the literature, a lack of systematic
understanding of the contingencies makes it difficult to clearly differentiate what is known and what gaps remain in this
literature. Providing a sound footing for future research can be facilitated by first systematically reviewing the relevant
literature. Focused themes were identified and analyzed using an ecological and interactive systems framework. Ten of the 12
retained studies included evacuation, revealing that evacuation is more likely to occur in an aged care facility than a hospital.
The unpredictability of an event also highlighted organizational, functional, and competency issues in regard to the complexity
of decision making and overall preparedness. The integrative review also identified that the unique roles, competencies, and
demands on nurses working in hospitals and residential health care facilities during a natural disaster appear invisible within
the highly visible event.

lens. Specifically, the review focused on primary research that
reported on large-scale natural disasters that involved nurses
working within residential health care facilities such as hospi-
tals and nursing homes. It examined lessons learned in relation
to roles, interrelationships, and activities; knowledge, skills,
and competencies; and processes and procedures that may
increase the potential for preparedness, adaptation, and resil-
ience. By integrating and synthesizing the empirical literature
of past natural disasters, it further clarifies what is already
known, identifies gaps, and provides direction for future
research in disaster management processes and preparedness
for nurses.
Hazard events can be natural (e.g., the result of an eco-
logical disruption such as cyclones, floods, pandemics, wild-
fires, earthquakes, and tornadoes) or man-made (e.g., acts of
terrorism). The capacity to respond determines whether an
adverse hazard event will be an emergency or develop into a
disaster (Pan American Health Organization, 2008). One
characteristic people, organizations, and societies have that
influences whether a hazard event becomes a disaster is their
intrinsic resilience (Paton & Johnston, 2006).
Resilience can be defined as an ability to be prepared and
have the capacity to "spring back from" (United Nations
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction [UNISDR],
2009) an adverse event, a disaster--natural or man-made. It
is also defined as the ability to withstand, recover from, and
thrive after a disaster (Smith, 2012). This concept has also
been linked to the adaptive capacity of individuals (Norris,
Stevens, Pfefferbaum, Wyche, & Pfefferbaum, 2008).
Adaptive capacity is described as the individual's or the
community's ability to cope with, adapt to, and develop from
the demands, challenges, and changes encountered during
and after disaster (Paton & Johnston, 2006; Paton & Violanti,
2011; Smith, 2012). Paton and Johnston discuss how the
complex nature of the disaster response context makes being
able to adapt to dynamic, emergent issues over time as par-
ticularly important in disaster recovery context (Paton &
Johnston, 2006).
Most health care facilities and staff are educated and pre-
pared to deal with any type and size of emergency event or
small-scale disaster, and although it may stretch resources,
procedures and processes are generally in place to respond
and address the situation (L. M. Brown, Hickling, & Frahm,
2010). A large-scale natural disaster, however, is a cata-
strophic event that is greater than any extraordinary emer-
gency (L. M. Brown, Hickling, & Frahm, 2010; P. R. Brown
et al., 2010), is often unforeseen, and will be affected by seri-
ous disruption to essential services such as electricity, water,
and sanitation (Quarantelli, 1997). The facility itself may
have to function in complete isolation or may have incurred
structural damage, and staff and patients within may have
been injured or killed (Priest & Bahl, 2008).
Consideration needs to be given to whether or not the
same planning that has gone into emergency preparedness
exists for what could be seen as an extraordinarily unlikely
event. How will nursing and health care personnel continue
to deliver a health care service at an optimal level during and
immediately after a large-scale natural disaster, especially if
access to services and technology is compromised, and they
have to deal with evolving demands over prolonged periods
of time?
Integrative Review
Integrative reviews may address either a mature or a new and
emerging issue (Torraco, 2005). A mature, well-developed
subject produces a plethora of literature with diverse opinion
and research methodologies. Disaster management is both
large and complex and continues to grow and contribute to
the body of knowledge on preparedness recommendations
and the development of resilient and adaptive organizations.
A large proportion of international nursing literature avail-
able on this subject, however, is experiential, based on per-
sonal opinion and not evidence based. The strength and
debatably a weakness of a review of this type is that it allows
for the integration and synthesis of a wide range of literature
and research methodologies (Torraco, 2005; Whittemore &
Knafl, 2005). Rigorous synthesis and critique of information
gathered can, however, further contribute to theory, practice,
and policy development (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005).
Search Method
Primary searches focused on electronic databases commonly
used for storing medical and nursing-related literature such
as Medline & Psych Info, CINAHL, Proquest Central.
Secondary hand searching of reference lists of relevantly
sourced articles was also undertaken (Figure 1). Key search
terms included derivations of Nurs*.mp, disaster, natural
disaster*.tw, catastroph*.tw, hospital, hospitalization, aged
care facility, preparedness, resilience, lessons learned*
[learnt]. Boolean terms of and/or were also used to incorpo-
rate further search terms such as knowledge, skills, compe-
tencies, roles, decisions, and recommendations.
This search included original primary research data (i.e.,
information derived from field studies using either quantita-
tive or qualitative research methodology), from peer-
reviewed, scholarly journals, English language only, and
years searched were 2002 to 2012. Gray literature (i.e., lit-
erature gained from secondary sources, such as, policies and
organizationally produced documents) and conference pro-
ceedings were not included in the search. Also excluded was
literature pertaining to pre-hospital or non-residential activi-
ties, volunteering outside of the nurses' own country or
health care facility.
When articles were assessed for inclusion, the terms natu-
ral disaster or catastrophe, included extreme weather events
(such as hurricanes, cyclones, big storms, or tornadoes), seis-
mic events (such as earthquakes and volcanic activity), and
general critical events due to a natural disaster that may
Scrymgeour et al. 3
cause surge capacity to an institution (such as evacuations).
Reference to man-made, biological, epidemic, or terrorist
disasters was excluded.
Theoretical Underpinnings to Data
Analysis
Content and thematic analysis was used to collate and inter-
pret the data from the integrative review. An ecological/inter-
acting systems framework was used to guide and help
provide fresh interpretation to the data. Researchers have
used an interactive systems approach to explore, understand,
and analyze the effects of a disaster on individuals, commu-
nities, systems, and organizations. Hoffman and Kruczek
(2011) used a bioecological model to review the literature on
mass traumas caused by large-scale disasters and commu-
nity-wide catastrophes. They believe that these events can be
better understood by using an "ecosystemic model" (Hoffman
& Kruczek, 2011, p. 1088) as a tool to analyze the traumatic
effects on individuals and communities. Their bioecological
model of mass trauma was based on Bronfenbrenner's bio-
ecological model of human development which was, up until
his death, continually evolving and is defined as "the phe-
nomenon of continuity and change in the biopsychological
characteristics of human beings, both as individuals and as
groups" (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006, p. 793).
Hoffman and Kruczek (2011) believed that an individual
is affected by interactions among systems that provide social
context and determines the impacts of events. Paton and
Johnston and Norris et al. echoed this and developed multi-
level, interdependent models of disaster resilience (Norris
et al., 2008; Paton & Johnston, 2006). In Bronfenbrenner's
(1979) original ecological theory, the interdependent struc-
tures or nested systems have various levels: microsystem,
mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Hoffman and
Kruczec have focused on Bronfenbrenner and Ceci's
expanded model in 1994 that included the addition of a bio-
logical element known as chronosystems (Hoffman &
Kruczek, 2011). This process refers to life changes that occur
over time that are dependent on changes to the environment,
which is also viewed as important to accommodate the tem-
poral dimension of disaster response (Paton, Johnston,
Mamula-Seadon, & Kenney, 2014). Critical distinctions
were also made between the proximal processes of environ-
ment and process, and are seen by Bronfenbrenner to be
interdependent and bidirectional (Bronfenbrenner & Morris,
2006).
The bioecological theory was also used by Boon, Cottrell,
King, Stevenson, and Millar (2012) to develop a tool to
model and assess community resilience at an individual and
community level to natural disasters. These authors used
their framework to hypothetically test an Australian commu-
nity to the effects of a disaster. Their application was not con-
text specific as it was derived from prior studies on disaster
resilience. They used data from actual events that occurred in
Beechworth, Victoria, and Innisfail and Ingham, Queensland,
as a proxy measure to develop and illustrate their model of
possible issues and resilience indicators. The authors believe
that Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory is useful to help
collate, interpret, and triangulate findings from multi-method
studies on disaster resilience (Boon et al., 2012).
Paton and Violanti's theory of ecological resilience and
model of adaptive capacity (Paton & Violanti, 2011) have
some similarities to Bronfenbrenner's descriptive model but
have been operationalized within a disaster context. Paton
and Violanti's model of adaptive capacity was originally
developed from empowerment theory, a construct often used
in management and organizational contexts, which includes
components of meaningfulness, competence, choice, and
perceived control. This theory, according to Paton (personal
communication,August 30, 2013) "provides a more coherent
starting point" when conceptualizing and analyzing adaptive
capacity within an organization because it highlights the
need to accommodate the interdependence between empow-
ered people and empowered settings. This makes it a useful
conceptual framework for the multi-level analysis of pro-
cesses that operate under conditions of uncertainty (which is

Group (2009).

pertinent with regard to the development of capability prior
to events occurring). They also assert that when developing a
model of adaptive capacity that facilitates resilience in high
risk professions, it is important to consider the interactions
and relationships of person, team, and organization, and
most importantly family (Paton & Violanti, 2011). These
authors believe that these factors are interdependent and the
combination of which will affect the likelihood of adaptive
capacity and resilience in the individual.
Results
From the initial screening of 233 records, all 12 studies that
met all inclusion criteria for final analysis were undertaken
in the United States. The type of disaster that affected their
facility were nine involving large-scale hurricanes, two
focused on a non-specified natural disaster event and one
following an earthquake. Two of the facilities studied were
hospitals and 10 were aged care facilities such as nursing
homes or assisted living facilities. Only half of the studies
directly interviewed nurses as a specific demographic. The
rest included nurses as one of the members of the multi-
disciplinary team involved. Methodologies included five
quantitative surveys, two mixed methods, and five qualita-
tive surveys.
Content within all the studies were initially examined and
coded manually into categories and analyzed with four pre-
determined key outcome messages or main focus of each
study in mind. The majority of the studies (n = 9) included
the key message of preparedness either with another cate-
gory or on its own. Knowledge and skills, decision making,
and resilience were only represented in three instances each,
either on its own or with another category.
Thematic Analysis
The data were further coded initially into broad themes using
NVivo9 software. All the 10 studies that involved nursing
homes included evacuation or sheltering in place as a key
theme. Focused themes were then identified and analyzed
using an ecological and interactive systems viewpoint as a
broad guide.
Distributed Decision Making Is Fundamental
The majority of articles within this review discussed issues
pertaining to the facilities either considering or requiring
evacuation or accepting evacuees. Multiple issues such as
resourcing and adequate staffing, provision of care and
patient safety, adequacy of shelter available, and transporta-
tion need to be considered prior to making a decision on
whether to evacuate or shelter in place. This cannot be made
without meticulous planning and expert decision making
across local agencies prior to an event, and should be
reflected within the organization's disaster plan (Hyer,
Brown, Christensen, & Thomas, 2009; Laditka et al., 2008;
Manley et al., 2006).
A successful outcome depended on developing prior rela-
tionships with multiple agencies and organizations, which
included well-coordinated and direct lines of communication
with emergency management organizations, the local com-
munity, and other health care facilities within the region.
Integrated emergency management processes were identified
as lacking or below par. Many reported the need for improved
communication with their emergency management and state
regulatory agencies (Castro, Persson, Bergstrom, & Cron,
2008; Laditka, Laditka, Cornman, Davis, & Richter, 2009;
Laditka et al., 2008; Saliba, Buchanan, & Kington, 2004),
with some administrators feeling the pressure to evacuate,
against their better judgment (Blanchard, 2009). Some felt
abandoned by the state, alone in decision making, and over-
all, nursing home residents did not seem to be a priority for
decisions on evacuation or ensuring essential supplies such
as electricity to a facility if sheltering in place (Dosa,
Grossman, Wetle, & Mor, 2007). Community assistance and
other nursing facilities, however, were seen as helpful and a
great support at critical times (Dosa et al., 2007; Laditka
et al., 2009; Saliba et al., 2004).
The success of these decisions also depended on the cor-
rect professional being involved at the initial planning phase
as it requires specific expertise in choosing appropriate, safe,
and fit-for-purpose emergency shelters, appropriate transpor-
tation, and predicting for adequate supplies and resources.
Nurses, some holding leadership roles, who were involved in
the actual care of their patients during the disaster, were often
excluded in the initial planning and this was reflected in
studies where nurses discussed how their lack of input had a
direct effect on staff and patient safety and privacy, and was
a barrier to care (Christensen, Brown, & Hyer, 2012; Hyer
et al., 2009; Laditka et al., 2009; Saliba et al., 2004). This can
be summed up by the following statement by Christensen
et al. (2012):
Although disaster nursing is tremendously challenging,
regardless of whether staff shelters in place or evacuates, our
study suggests that asking these critical questions before
evacuating to a non-clinical facility can help reduce hazards to
both residents and staff. (p. 382)
Personal Exposure and Interconnections of the
Individual Influences the Functioning of the
Individual as a Professional
The unpredictability and past experiences of disasters and
personal worries of the potential impact of the disaster on
patients, staff members, their families, pets, and houses
affected the functional capacity and performance of staff
within a facility. Facilities were understaffed due to absen-
teeism (Dosa et al., 2007; Hyer et al., 2009; Saliba et al.,
2004). One administrator reported that they had to "mandate
Scrymgeour et al. 5
all staff participate in evacuation" (Hyer et al., 2009, p. e11),
and employees were threatened with disciplinary action and
some were terminated if they did not turn up for work.
Whereas, Castro et al. (2008) reported that allowing family
members to evacuate with their staff members increased staff
coverage. This was also the case for some facilities that shel-
tered in place, with one respondent claiming that they had
more staff than they needed (Hyer et al., 2009). Suggestions
were also made to consider increasing the level of supplies
stockpiled from the standard guidelines of 3 days to at least a
week (Laditka et al., 2008) to cater for staff bringing their
family members and pets with them.
Physical and mental exhaustion of staff and putting their
patients and facility ahead of their family concerns were also
issues raised (Laditka et al., 2009). A small pilot study of ED
nurses by Battles (2007) highlighted the potential for post-
traumatic stress to affect their ability to adapt and respond
both personally and professionally during and after a disas-
ter, and may continue to have lasting effects on them.
Directors of nursing (DoNs) focus group participants in a
study conducted by L. M. Brown, Hyer, Schinka, Mando,
Frazier, & Polivka-West (2010) suggested that all direct care
providers should be trained in psychological first aid, which
could be provided following a disaster to meet the mental
health needs of both patients and their staff member
colleagues.
Functional Capability and Adaptive Demands on
Nurses Often Hidden Within the Multidisciplinary
and Inter-Agency Context of a Disaster
In most articles, nurses were included in the general descrip-
tion of staff respondents. This included facility administra-
tors; direct or non-direct care staff; allied staff such as social
workers, physiotherapists, and Occupational Therapists;
ancillary such as domestic, kitchen, or maintenance and
other professionals identified as physicians and psycholo-
gists. Most studies focused on the effect on the facility,
patients, and staff as a whole, and administrators were identi-
fied as their key respondents. Two identified specific inter-
views with DoNs (Christensen et al., 2012; Laditka et al.,
2009) and two studies interviewed or included data from ED
nurses (Battles, 2007; Manley et al., 2006). This made it dif-
ficult to clearly identify the unique roles, competencies, and
demands of nurses involved in a disaster. Only one study
(Laditka et al., 2009) reported evidence of resilience in staff,
and recommended this potential in staff warrants further
study. Nursing resilience or adaptive capacity was not identi-
fied or mentioned.
Summary
Results from the integrative review highlight that evacuation
is more likely to occur in an aged care facility/nursing home
than a hospital. Ten of the 12 studies examined in the
integrative review included evacuation and decisions about
evacuation or shelter in place as a key issue. A successful
outcome for patients and staff following an evacuation
requires well-prepared employees who have undergone
training/education, regular site visits, and spot drills.
Facilities that incorporated the lessons learned from previous
disasters into their disaster plans found that it improved their
overall level of preparedness and strengthened their commu-
nication and collaboration with community and emergency
management authorities during the next disaster. Successful
decisions also depended on the correct professional being
involved at the initial planning phase as it requires specific
expertise in choosing appropriate, safe, and fit-for-purpose
emergency shelters, appropriate transportation, and predict-
ing for adequate supplies and resources.
Staff workload increases during a disaster with lack of
sleep and breaks a contributing factor to increasing stress. In
some cases, these increased levels of stress in staff caused a
desensitization to the distress in patients, and had the poten-
tial to mask a mental health problem. Evacuated patients
were more likely to experience depression and anxiety. This
also contributed to increased staff workload with needing to
spend more time providing emotional reassurance as well as
providing for their usual care requirements often under try-
ing circumstances due to lack of resources and normal ser-
vices. A small pilot study of ED nurses highlighted the
potential for posttraumatic stress to affect their ability to
adapt and respond both personally and professionally during
and after a disaster and may continue to have lasting effects
on them. Some studies reported, however, that many staff
had positive experiences and found that the events helped to
build stronger relationships with their patients and other staff
members. In most articles, nurses were included in the gen-
eral description of staff respondents. This made it difficult to
clearly identify the unique roles, competencies, and demands
of nurses involved in a disaster.
Discussion
The complexity of decision making is highlighted within this
review. The level of uncertainty is often exacerbated by the
dynamic nature of a large-scale disaster. Decisions are dis-
tributed over a range of people, teams, agencies, and organi-
zations. This usually involves multiple decision makers with
varying levels of expertise, local knowledge, with varying
organizational procedures and processes. This type of deci-
sion making is referred to by Schneeweiss (2003b) as distrib-
uted decision making where multiple decision makers are
united in a mutual problem or issue (Schneeweiss, 2003a).
Decision-making strategies and coping with uncertainty and
stress have been explored and analyzed extensively by many
researchers (Aldunate, Pena-Mora, & Robinson, 2005; Flin,
Salas, Strub, & Martin, 1997; Gore, Banks, Millward, &
Kyriakidou, 2006; Serfaty & Entin, 1997). Effective and
adaptive decision making involves the person, teams, and
6 SAGE Open
organizations to be able to be open, flexible, and have com-
mon situational awareness and a shared mental model of the
problem. This, in turn, contributes to resilient and adaptive
teams and organizations (Serfaty & Entin, 1997).
Ecological and interactive systems models are a useful
foundation to view and interpret resilience within the indi-
vidual, team, organization, and community. Paton and
Violanti's (2011) model of adaptive capacity describes resil-
ience and adaptive capacity as "resulting from the interaction
among person, team, organizational and family factors with
each level of analysis being interdependent" (p. 165). These
authors maintain that empowerment of individuals collec-
tively helps to build a resilient workforce and organization.
They believe that developing and building on interpretive
frameworks from past critical events, through facilitating
competencies from lessons learned of past experiences, help
to build the adaptive capacity of professionals working in
high risk professions (Paton & Violanti, 2011).
Conclusion
This review highlighted many organizational, functional,
and competency issues that affected the preparedness of
health care professionals during a natural disaster. Many
issues and lessons learned have been raised previously in
disaster-related health care literature. One factor that appears
to be missing is the focus on the adaptive demands specifi-
cally on nurses working in residential health care facilities
during and after an event. Their roles and responsibilities
were often invisible within the highly visible event. Research
exploring the adaptive demands of nurses in a critical event
such as a large-scale natural disaster may help to further
highlight the important roles nurses play and the effect that it
may have on a health care facility.
