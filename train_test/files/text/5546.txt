Introduction
Eating disorders (EDs) are a family of conditions character-
ized by excessive preoccupation with food, typically resulting
in abnormal eating behavior, food intake (either insufficient
or excessive), and/or compensatory behaviors (American
Psychiatric Association, 2006). These conditions pose serious
physical health threats as the emotional and psychological
consequences of these behaviors undermine the individual's
well-being (e.g., Stice & Shaw, 2004). Clinically diagnosed
EDs are traditionally categorized roughly into three types: (a)
Anorexia Nervosa (AN), a family of disorders sharing a com-
ponent of excessive control and limitation of food intake, (b)
Bulimia nervosa (BN), a family of disorders typically charac-
terized by binging and compensatory behaviors (purging,
laxative abuse, vigorous physical activity) and (c) EDs not
otherwise specified (NOS; Allen & Dalton, 2011). EDs afflict
up to 5% of the general population in the U.S. and similar
proportions of the Israeli population (assessed at 6%-8%),
where the current study is set (Worgaft, 2011).
The scientific study of EDs is a relatively new field, gain-
ing momentum in the 1960s, and revealing alarming spread
and increasing prevalence of the phenomenon (Hudson,
Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007; Polivy & Herman, 2002).
Often considered a teenager condition, research now pro-
vides worrying evidence suggesting EDs can be a lifelong
burden and afflict persons of all ages (Collier & Treasure,
2004). Moreover, recent surveys show most EDs, especially
Anorexia and Bulimia (in all of their versions and types), can
be seen more as a continuum of behavioral patterns rather
than a specific pathological condition (Fairburn & Bohn,
2005; Hudson et al., 2007). In other words, a tendency
toward ED can express itself in a very broad range of man-
ners, from exaggerated worries or thoughts about food and
food consumption, all the way to clinically diagnosed and
life-threatening EDs. This means that beyond diagnosed
individuals, many more suffer patterns and symptoms caus-
ing psychological and physical distress, and are potentially at
risk, without being diagnosed or properly attended to.
Studies have concentrated on identifying correlates and
risk factors of EDs. Gender and age are the most prevalent
factors associated with disordered eating: EDs are dramati-
cally more prevalent among women. Puberty and adoles-
cence are the life periods most often associated with the
onset of EDs (Hudson et al., 2007; Polivy & Herman, 2002).
Social norms promoting thinness and their expression in the
media and youth culture were also frequently associated with
higher incidence of EDs or disordered eating (Harrison &
Cantor, 1997; Levine & Smolak, 1996).
Personality traits and other personal characteristics have
also been associated with proneness to EDs: Fragile self-
esteem and distorted self-image, neuroticism, perfectionism,
and one of its correlates, perceived control, have been often

Emotional Intelligence, Perceived
Control, and Eating Disorders
Leehu Zysberg1 and Einav Tell2
Abstract
Studies on Emotional Intelligence (EI) have demonstrated the concept's potential in accounting for a broad range of health-
related outcomes. Preliminary evidence associates measures of EI with disordered eating and other related behaviors. This
study proposed a mediation effect of perceived control in the above association. We hypothesized that (a) EI will positively
associate with perceived control and (b) perceived control will associate positively with Anorexia and negatively with Bulimia
symptomatology. One hundred and thirty young adults residing in Israel filled out measures assessing Anorexia (drive for
thinness), Bulimia, perceived control, and EI (two measures). The results lent only partial support to the hypotheses: EI showed
a nonlinear association with control, which in turn showed nonlinear association with Anorexia scores, and contrary to our
hypothesis, positive association with Bulimia scores. A Sobel test supported the mediation models for both eating disorder
measures. The results are discussed and future research is proposed to further examine this hypothesized mechanism.

associated with patterns of disordered eating (Cervera et al.,
2003; Lavender & Anderson, 2010). The literature suggests
high levels of control are associated with Anorexia, leading
restrictive eating behaviors as inefficient expression of self-
control and at times--control of others (e.g., Jarman, Smith,
& Walsh, 1997). Additional evidence also link low levels of
control to Bulimia/binge eating patterns: Emotional and
social pressures express themselves in uncontrolled eating
behavior, again--in an inadequate attempt to keep emotions
at bay (Matheson et al., 2012; Osborn et al., 2013; Williams,
Arnold, & Millar, 1990; Williams et al., 1993).
A relatively new concept relating to emotional function
introduced into the study of EDs is that of Emotional
Intelligence (EI). One prevalent conceptualization of EI
describes it as a group of abilities allowing individuals to
identify, process, and integrate emotion in reasoning. It also
refers to individual's ability to effectively manage and regu-
late their emotional responses (Mayer, Roberts, & Barsade,
2008; Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2000). This definition
illustrates a link between EI and emotional regulation and
coping, but does EI offers added value in accounting for EDs
beyond regulation? Only a few studies dealt with the role of
EI in disordered eating and EDs, revealing the potential con-
tribution of the concept on the theoretical and practical levels
(Markey & Vander Wal, 2007; Zysberg, 2013; Zysberg &
Rubanov, 2010). These studies however did not provide evi-
dence to the process by which EI may be related to EDs and
disordered eating.
The current study sought to further examine the role of EI
in ED symptomatology by first moving from the discussion
of EI and "disordered eating" or "emotional eating" to spe-
cific ED symptomatology and by proposing a mediation
mechanism: We propose that perceived sense of control
mediates the association between EI and ED symptomatol-
ogy. As EI represents among others, the ability to identify
and regulate one's emotional responses and as emotional
regulation plays a major role in ED symptomatology we
hypothesized that (a) EI will be positively associated with
perceived control and (b) perceived control will show a dif-
ferential association with ED measures, more specifically,
(b1) perceived control will positively associate with ten-
dency toward Anorexia, and (b2) perceived control will neg-
atively associate with tendency toward Bulimia.
We tested our hypotheses in a sample of Israeli young
adults in an attempt to not only look at clinically diagnosed
groups but also observe behaviors ranging from normative to
severe EDs and their associations with our variables of
interest.
Method
This study used a correlational design to examine the poten-
tial associations between the two EI measures, a measure of
perceived control and measures of tendency towardAnorexia
and Bulimia.
Sample
One hundred and thirty young adults living in Israel (ages =
21-31; M = 26.67; SD = 3.47), of whom 93 (71.5%) were
women were recruited through online websites and social
networks. Participants were excluded from the study if they
had any health condition that influences appetite, or require
medication that alters appetite or food consumption. The
sample size was determined using G-power (Erdfelder, Faul,
& Buchner, 1996), setting minimum power at .90 with alpha
set at .05, considering the number of main variables in the
model.
Measures
Tendency for ED was assessed using the Eating Disorder
Inventory II (EDI II; Garner, 1991). This is a self-report
91-item questionnaire assessing behavioral and cognitive
patterns associated with EDs. The original measure produces
11 subscales, but in this study, only the subscales concerning
drive for thinness representing Anorexia, and Bulimia were
included in our preliminary analysis. These scales show
acceptable reliability and construct validity in previous stud-
ies, as well as in studies which translated the measure into
Hebrew (Garner, 1991; Niv, Kaplan, Mitrani, & Shiang,
1998). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha was .90 for the
Anorexia scale and .83 for the Bulimia scale. The scale is
ranked on a scale from 1 to 6 to denote increasing agreement
with statements.
Perceived Control was assessed using the Perceived
Control Scale (Hobfoll & Walfish, 1984), a 7-item question-
naire based on the work of Pearlin and Schooler (1978). This
scale assesses the extent to which people feel they are in con-
trol over events in their life. A 7-point Likert-type scale
allows participants to mark their level of agreement with
each statement. The scale has established evidence of reli-
ability and validity. In the current study, its Cronbach's alpha
was .67.
EI was assessed using two separate measures, represent-
ing two approaches to the concept: a test approach (where
participants are presented with problems they need to answer
correctly) and a self-report approach (where participants
report their behaviors and perceptions).
The Audio-Visual Test of Emotional Intelligence (AVEI) is
a 27-item computer-based test of EI following the ability
approach to EI (Zysberg, Levy, & Zisberg, 2011). Participants
are presented with still and video captures in which they are
asked to identify the emotion experienced by a target person.
The test has shown adequate reliability, and criterion-related
validity in previous studies (e.g., Zysberg, 2013; Zysberg
et al., 2011).
The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS) is a
33-item self-report measure of EI, designed within the ability
approach to EI. It has shown evidence of good reliability and
is common in current studies on EI (Schutte et al., 2001;
Zysberg and Tell 3
Schutte et al., 1998; Schutte, Malouf, Thorsteinsson, Bhullar,
& Rooke, 2007). In the current study, Cronbach's alpha coef-
ficient was .88.
Demographic information regarding gender, age, and
additional background variables was collected using a short
demographic questionnaire designed for this study.
Procedure
The study was approved by the Institutional review board
(IRB) of the authors' academic institution. Participants were
approached online in various social media targeting young
adults. The researchers presented the study as one focusing
on "eating-related habits and thoughts." Online completion
of the questionnaire packet took about 40 min according to
some of the participants' reports. One of the authors was
available via email in case questions or issues were raised by
participants. The online administration system allowed only
participants who fully completed the procedure to submit
their data, so there were no missing values in the database;
however, the system did not keep record of participants drop-
ping out during the procedure.
Data Analysis
The lack of a substantial body of evidence regarding the
association between EI and our focal variables led us to use
a series of regressions fitting various models (linear and non-
linear) to our data and compare the coefficients to identify
the models offering most explained variance. We also tested
for mediation using Sobel's test (Sobel, 1982) to account for
the general model proposed in this study.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
We first examined the distributions of the main variables in
our study. Table 1 summarizes central tendency and disper-
sion indices for the main variables, as well as simple
Pearson's correlations between them.
The statistics suggest a proper distribution of the study
variables, well within their reported range in the literature.
The preliminary associations found between the variables
only partially supported our hypotheses: Only one of the
measures of EI associated positively with control. The same
measure also showed a moderate positive association with
Anorexia score. Control associated positively with Anorexia
and Bulimia scores.
Hypothesis Testing
We used a series of regression and curve estimation analyses.
To reduce the effects of capitalization of chance, we used a
significancelevelof.03determinedaccordingtoBonferroni's
formula (e.g., Abdi, 2007). We first examined the associa-
tions between the two measures of EI with perceived control,
while controlling for age and gender (both demographics
associated with EDs). In a linear regression analysis, both EI
measures showed significant positive association with self-
reported control (for the AVEI,  = .18; t = 2.07; p < .03, for
SEIS,  = .35; t = 4.85; p < .01, while gender and age
remained nonsignificant. We then continued to fit two mod-
els of regression: linear versus quadratic, using both the
above measures of EI as factors and control as the dependent
variable. For both EI factors, the quadratic model showed
better fit indices suggesting a "U"-shaped association
between EI and perceived control, for AVEI,   = .26; F =
4.32 (df = 2); p < .02, for SEIS,  = .41; F = 13.84 (df = 2),
p < .001. This deviated from our original hypothesis, and
may suggest the association between EI and control is non-
linear. For a graphic representation of the curve-fit results,
see Figure 1.
We then examined the associations between perceived
control and Anorexia and Bulimia symptom scores using a
curve estimation analyses to compare two models: linear
versus quadratic. According to our hypothesis, we expected
the quadratic association to show better fit to our data. The
results of the analyses conducted separately for Anorexia and
Bulimia scores are presented in Figures 2 and 3.
The results provide only partial support to our hypothesis:
The association between perceived control and Anorexia
scores fitted our hypothesis but further examination of the
association pattern revealed a nonlinear relationship we did
not hypothesize about. Bulimia scores however associated

with control in a linear manner showing a moderate positive
association, contrary to our original hypothesis.
Last, we tested for mediation of perceived control of the
association between EI and Anorexia/Bulimia scores. We
used the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982; Soper, 2012) that provided
support for mediation effects in both cases (Sobel test
statistics = 2.47/2.34; p < .02 for both models). See the

models.

Discussion
Thus far only preliminary evidence is in existence linking
EI with disordered eating and even less deals with diag-
nosed EDs (e.g., Markey & Vander Wal, 2007; Zysberg,
2013; Zysberg & Rubanov, 2010). In this study, we sought
to deepen our understanding of the above association in
two ways: first, looking at the ED symptomatology range
rather than emotional eating of disordered eating in gen-
eral (as previous studies did). Second, we proposed a
mediation model in which self-perceived control may
account for associations between EI and ED. Control is a
known psychological component in EDs etiology (e.g.,
Fairburn et al., 1998; Waller, 1998). Perceived control is
also positively associated with EI, a concept revolving
around effective management and regulation of emo-
tional reactions (Johnson, Batey, & Holdsworth, 2009;
Salovey, Hsee, & Mayer, 1993). Results from a sample of
130 Israeli young adults, demonstrating a range of ED
symptomatology (normative to disordered) supported a
mediating model, though only partially congruent with
our original model. Perceived control mediated the asso-
ciations between EI and ED scores for Anorexia and
Bulimia.
Contrary to our original hypothesis, which proposed a
positive linear association between EI and perceived con-
trol, we found (despite a significant moderate linear asso-
ciation) that a quadratic model showed better fit to the data.
In other words: higher levels of perceived control were
associated with either low or high EI. This may reflect a
more complex manner in which EI is associated with per-
ception and sense of control. We propose that people with
lower EI's report of perceived control could be reflecting a
different essence than that reported by people with higher
EI (e.g., false sense of control vs. perceived control based
on more accurate self-perception?). Additional research is
required, however, to test such a proposal. Perceived con-
trol, in turn, showed a nonlinear association with Anorexia
scores where moderate levels of control were associated
with lower Anorexia, while lower or higher control corre-
sponded with higher Anorexia scores. For Bulimia we
found a positive linear association with perceived control, a
deviation from our hypothesis. This finding is also a devia-
tion from the trend reported in the literature associating
bulimic behavior with lack of control (e.g., Colles, Dixon,
& O'brien, 2012). These results may be accounted for by
the nature of our sample that included individuals repre-
senting the full range of eating behaviors. The proposed
simple associations between control and ED symptomatol-
ogy is often based on comparison of clinically diagnosed
samples with normative sample, ignoring the potential
range of behaviors spreading across the full spectrum of
eating behaviors (e.g., Dalgleish et al., 2001). Our results
suggest that the association may be more complex than that
proposed in the classic literature (e.g., Sim & Ziman, 2006;
Waller, 1998). Such a suggestion should be treated cau-
tiously until future studies provide more support or refute
it. The notion of control and the way it is assessed vis-à-vis
the tendency toward EDs often varies across studies, posing
a methodological hurdle to generalization regarding this
association.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical
attempt to support an explanatory model of EI's involve-
ment in EDs. Some limitations, however, should be con-
sidered when interpreting our results: Our sample was
taken from a functional, nonclinical population. Though
we did find a good range of our outcome measures in the
data collected, future studies may look into the nature of
these associations in clinically diagnosed and treated sam-
ples. Our results suggest that essential differences may
exist in the dynamics of personal factors associated with
behaviors on the EDs range in clinical and nonclinical
samples. Additional studies may wish to adopt a compara-
tive approach to this question. The use of an Israeli sample
may raise future questions regarding culture and other
population-related variables involved in our results. Again,
future studies may look at these variables in various cul-
tural settings. Last, the use of a correlational design limits
our ability to discuss causation in our results. Experimental
designs may be used in future research attempts along
these lines to strengthen our model's causal and potentially
predictive nature.
The above limitations acknowledged, this study points in
a direction providing promising yet challenging preliminary
evidence to the associations between EI, perceived control,
and EDs. Should future research support it, such a model can
be of use in our theoretical understanding of the nature of EI
and its associations with various eating-related behaviors.
An additional benefit of this proposed model is the potential
for guiding future screening, and intervention with individu-
als suffering from EDs.
