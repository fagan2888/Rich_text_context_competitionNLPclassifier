During the past decade, numerous research projects have focused on the devel-
opment and implementation of spatial statistical analysis software. This issue brings
together a collection of articles representing recent developments in spatial analysis
software for the social sciences. The articles were selected from those presented at
two recent conferences on spatial information science. The first was a specialist
meeting on ``Spatial Software Tools Development,`` sponsored by the U.S. Center
for Spatial Integrated Social Science and held in May 2002 in Santa Barbara, Cal-
ifornia.1 The second gathering was a symposium on ``Spatial Information Science
for Human and Social Science,'' held at the University of Tokyo in January 2004.
The two meetings covered a wide range of issues from tool development and
design to user communities and applications. They brought together a productive
mix of software developers, empirical researchers, and private and public sector
entities to take stock of the state of the science regarding tools for spatial data
analysis. What emerged from these meetings was a sense of a vibrant field con-
tributing to tools being increasingly applied in research across the social sciences.
Given these developments, we thought it was timely to bring together a represent-
ative selection of articles that highlight some of the key issues and developments in
this rapidly evolving field.
The first article, by Anselin, Syabri, and Kho provides an overview of GeoDa, a
free program supporting interactive exploratory spatial data analysis. GeoDa is tar-
geted at the non-GIS (geographical information systems) user and is designed to
require as little as possible in terms of other software packages. Its goal is to provide
analysts with a user-friendly, but powerful, integrated package that supports all
phases of an empirical spatial data analysis, from mapping and geovisualization to
spatial autocorrelation analysis, multivariate exploratory data analysis, and finally
confirmatory spatial regression analysis. Although the implementation described in
this article is a closed-source package, an ongoing research effort is porting the
code to an open-source toolkit and making the package available to multiple plat-
forms (Windows, MacOS X, and Linux/Unix).

In the second article, Roger Bivand provides an overview of recent work im-
plementing functions for spatial statistical analysis in the open-source R language
environment. Bivand draws on lessons learned from the R project about how to
combine both substantive expertise and infrastructure support to achieve critical
mass and mutually beneficial knowledge and tool exchange. The article describes
how the R project functions in general, and outlines the main packages in the
project designed for the analysis of spatial data. The spatial analytical capabilities of
the spdep package are then illustrated using data on sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) in North Carolina. Future opportunities for advancing spatial data analysis
in R are also outlined.
Ned Levine's article, about the CrimeStat spatial statistics program, presents a
description of the main components of the program and outlines its potential use
both in crime-related research as well as in fields such as geography, epidemiology,
forestry science, botany, and geology. CrimeStat is a stand-alone Windows pro-
gram for the analysis of the spatial pattern of crimes and is designed to interface
with most desktop GIS programs. The interface is carried out through using graph-
ical objects produced by CrimeStat, which are linked to packages such as ArcView,
ArcGis, and MapInfo. Levine describes a number of examples involving spa-
tial autocorrelation, hot-spot detection, spatial interpolation, and journey-to-crime
analysis, which illustrate the statistical and visualization capabilities of the
package.
While the first three articles in the issue primarily deal with area and point data,
the article by Okabe, Okunuki, and Shiode outlines a GIS-based toolbox for network
data, SANET (Spatial Analysis on a NETwork). This software is designed to deal with
two classes of network phenomena, those that occur on a network (e.g., traffic
accidents) and those that occur in proximity to, but not on, a network (e.g., restau-
rants in an urban area which may have entrances on multiple streets). Due to
computational complexity, network data are often modeled using planar spatial
methods, yet such an approach is likely to lead to false conclusions given the non-
planar nature of network data. The authors argue that to properly analyze network
phenomena, user-friendly tools for network spatial analysis must be available.
SANET consists of two components, one implementing a suite of 12 different net-
work analysis modules and the second providing a SANET­ArcView interface using a
loose-coupling model.
The fourth article, by Sergio Rey and Mark Janikas, introduces the package
STARS, Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems. STARS is an open-source pack-
age designed for the dynamic exploration of areal data measured over multiple time
periods. Written in the Python object-oriented scripting language, STARS combines
a number of new statistical methods for exploration of spatial dynamics together
with a set of interactive geovisualization and statistical graphics. STARS provides
both a user-friendly graphical user interface as well as the option of employing the
command line interface for interactive scripting and customization. A selection of
the core functions of STARS is illustrated using data on U.S. income dynamics.

Hanan Samet and Robert Webber report on a three-dimensional visualization
extension to the SAND spatial database system. SAND denotes Spatial and Non-
spatial Data and emphasizes a tight coupling of spatial and nonspatial data repre-
sentation and queries. This coupling relies on quadtree-style indexing strategies and
originally focused on two-dimensional spatial objects, such as county boundaries
and river systems. The extension presented here focuses on the incorporation of a
third dimension through a new object type, the isosurface. This results in a powerful
technique for performing clustering and windowing.
In the final contribution, Ningchuan Xiao and Marc Armstrong report on the
package ChoroWare, which adopts a multiobjective approach to the construction
of choropleth map class intervals. ChoroWare implements a specialized island
model which is a genetic algorithm that evaluates the ``fitness'' of each classifica-
tion scheme against four different objective functions. Each classification (individ-
ual) is assigned a fitness value according to its nondomination against other
classifications. Classifications with high fitness values are then selected to produce
the next generation of solutions, which are modified by a crossover (migration
across the islands) model.
The appearance of these and other spatial analysis tools is arguably in response
to earlier calls by GIScience researchers for the development of new software
for spatial data analysis (Haining 1989; Anselin and Getis 1992; Goodchild
et al. 1992). We view those initial calls as representing a first phase of research
in the evolution of spatial data analysis software. Originally, the focus was largely
on conceptual issues and general discussions of required functionality. A second
stage in this evolution was characterized by intensive tool development, imple-
mentation, and initial dissemination efforts (Anselin 2000; Goodchild et al. 2000).
At present, we see the early signs that the field has entered a third phase of evo-
lution, in which refined development is being driven and informed by interaction
with wider scientific communities that eagerly adopt the tools.
In this third phase, we view the growing popularity of spatial analysis tools
as a reflection of several emerging themes in contemporary research. The first is
that researchers are engaging in more hands-on programming as part of their
empirical analyses. In part, this is required by the increasingly complex nature of
the research questions of interest, because existing commercial off-the-shelf
packages often lack the required analytical functions. The second theme pertains
to the recent rise in popularity of higher level scripting languages, such as Python,
TCL, and Ruby. These languages have flattened the scientific computing learning
curve. Because of their accessibility, these languages are experiencing increased
mindshare, which in turn, leads to thicker and wider scientific user communities
and further advances in computationally based tools for spatial social science
research.
We hope that by bringing together the current collection of articles readers will
gain increased familiarity with the related projects. This should enhance the po-
tential for applying the tools in their own research programs and the possibility of
