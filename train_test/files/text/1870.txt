ABSTRACT
SANDERS, L. F., and G. E. DUNCAN. Population-Based Reference Standards for Cardiovascular Fitness among U.S. Adults:
NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­2002. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 38, No. 4, pp. 701­707, 2006. Purpose: To provide reference
standards for cardiovascular fitness levels, using population-based estimates of estimated maximal oxygen uptake (V
 O2max
) from a
diverse sample of U.S. adults. Methods: Analysis of data from adults (20­49 yr) who completed a submaximal exercise test in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2000 and 2001­2002. Estimated V
 O2max
was categorized as low (G 20th
percentile), moderate (between 20th and 59th percentiles), or high (Q 60th percentile) fitness using age- and sex-specific cut-points.
Results: There were 1978 subjects, roughly 29% Mexican-American, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 51% non-Hispanic white. Using
population-based sample weights, this was equivalent to 54,078,766 persons with mean (T SE) age, 34.4 T 0.3 yr; body mass index
(BMI), 27.0 T 0.2 kgImj2; and estimated V
 O2max
, 40.4 T 0.3 mLIminj1Ikgj1. There was a significant association between race and
fitness level and between race and fitness level by sex (P G 0.0001). Low fitness was highest among non-Hispanic blacks (percentage
(95% confidence interval): (32%, (26­38%)) compared with Mexican-Americans (22% (18­27%)) and non-Hispanic whites (18%
(15­21%)), particularly among females, where 35% (28­42%) non-Hispanic black women had low fitness compared with 22% (16.3­
27.4%) Mexican-American and 18% (13.7­22.4%) non-Hispanic white women. Conclusions: Non-Hispanic black adults have the
highest percentage of low cardiovascular fitness among major race groups in the United States. On a population basis, over one third
of non-Hispanic black women have low cardiovascular fitness, suggesting this group in particular may be at increased health risk due
to poor fitness. Key Words: MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, RACE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH
Physical inactivity is an important etiologic factor in
many chronic conditions, including obesity, type 2
diabetes, and several manifestations of cardiovascu-
lar disease (2,5,8,13). Although the benefits of exercise are
well known, the majority of the U.S. population does not
engage in activities that are consistent with the levels
recommended for health (6).
An important outcome of physical activity is cardiovas-
cular fitness, measured as maximal oxygen uptake
(V
 O2max
), a health-related component of overall physical
fitness that relates to the ability of the circulatory and
respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the body during
sustained physical activity (11). Though genetic factors
explain approximately 40­60% of the variation in V
 O2max
(3,4), cardiovascular fitness can also be improved in most
individuals who participate in appropriate physical activi-
ties (1,11). There is compelling evidence to support the
concept that increased cardiovascular fitness can decrease
many chronic health risks (9,13,14). To this end, increasing
the number of U.S. adults who participate in physical
activity, particularly vigorous activity, that promotes the
development and maintenance of cardiovascular fitness is a
national health objective (12).
Our group recently provided national estimates of
V
 O2max
(estimated from submaximal exercise testing) and
sex- and age-specific cardiovascular fitness levels among
U.S. adults, based on data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999­2000 and
2001­2002) (7). The cardiovascular fitness levels for adults
in NHANES were established using V
 O2max
cut-points
derived from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study
(ACLS) (2). In our recent study, we found that fitness
levels were lowest among non-Hispanic black adults,
particularly among non-Hispanic black women. However,
differences in the distribution of low, moderate, and high
fitness among the various groups examined may have been

caused by a potential for bias or misclassification because
the cut-points for categorizing and reporting cardiovascular
fitness levels in NHANES were based on data from the
ACLS, a mostly non-Hispanic white sample. The purpose
of the present study was to determine the distribution of
cardiovascular fitness levels among U.S. adults based on
estimated V
 O2max
cut-points derived from NHANES, a
large, nationally representative sample of the U.S. popula-
tion. In turn, the new cut-points established in this study
might be useful reference standards to categorize cardio-
vascular fitness levels of U.S. adults for health risk
assessment purposes.
METHODS
The NHANES survey design is a stratified, multistage
probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S.
population (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). The
current NHANES includes oversampling of Mexican-
American and non-Hispanic black persons to improve
estimates for these groups. Approximately 9965 persons
aged 2 months to 85 yr were studied in NHANES 1999­
2000 and 11,039 persons in NHANES 2001­2002. The
NHANES protocol was reviewed and approved by the
National Center for Health Statistic_s institutional review
board. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants prior to any testing.
Testing procedures and details of the NHANES protocol
are available elsewhere (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/
major/nhanes/). All individuals aged 12­49 yr were
eligible to participate in the cardiovascular fitness­testing
component of NHANES. Participants were screened prior
to testing using questionnaires and a physical examination.
Certain medical conditions (e.g., angina and self-reported
lung or breathing problems) excluded individuals from
testing, as well as medication usage (e.g., antiarrhythmias
and beta-blockers), and physical limitations (e.g., bone or
joint problems that could be made worse by walking) that
would interfere with cardiovascular responses to exercise.
Health technicians, all trained using a common protocol,
performed the fitness examination. Participants were
assigned to one of eight submaximal treadmill test
protocols, based on sex, age, body mass index (BMI,
kgImj2), and self-reported level of physical activity. The
goal of each protocol was to elicit a HR that was
approximately 75% of the age-predicted maximum
(220 j age) by the end of the test. Each protocol included
a 2-min warm-up, two 3-min exercise stages, and a 2-min
cool-down period.
The primary outcome for the fitness component was
estimated V
 O2max
(mLIminj1Ikgj1), calculated from the
HR response to known levels of submaximal work. Based
on sex- and age-specific criteria, the estimated V
 O2max
was
also categorized and reported as a low, moderate, or high
level of cardiovascular fitness. These cut-points were
established from data for adults ages 20­49 yr from the
ACLS (2,10). Low cardiovascular fitness was defined as an
estimated V
 O2max
below the 20th percentile of the same
sex and age group; a moderate fitness level was a value
between the 20th and 59th percentiles, and high fitness was
at or above the 60th percentile (Table 1).
Data from each survey were linked using the unique survey
participant identifier (SEQN). The initial sample consisted of
2214 nonpregnant adults aged 20­49 yr who had an estimated
V
 O2max
value recorded. Participants who were categorized
as ``other Hispanics'' and ``other races, including multira-
cial'' were excluded from the analyses because of inade-
quate sample sizes for these groups. Of the 2214 participants
in the initial sample, six participants who had extreme
estimated V
 O2max
values (Q 87.5 mLIminj1Ikgj1, at or
above the 99th percentile of the sample distribution), and all
participants with missing or negative sampling weights (N =
230) were excluded, giving a final sample of 1978 adults
who had complete data available for the analyses. Based on
data from this sample and the corresponding population-
based sample weights, identical sex- and age-specific
criteria was used to establish new cut-points to categorize
estimated V
 O2max
as a low, moderate, or high level of
cardiovascular fitness (Table 2). We then reanalyzed the
distribution of low, moderate, and high cardiovascular
fitness using these new cut-points.
Data were analyzed using SAS (Version 9.1, SASÒ
Institute, Cary, NC) survey procedures. The full sample
was analyzed using the 4-yr full sample medical examina-
tion weights (WTMEC4YR) to estimate means and 95%
confidence intervals (CI), and the masked variance units
(pseudo-primary sampling units (SDMVPSU) and pseudo-
stratum (SDMVSTRA)) to estimate the SEM. Continuous
variables are presented as a mean (T SE), including age,
BMI, and estimated V
 O2max
. Categorical variables are
presented as a frequency (N), weighted frequency (based
on sampling weights), and percentage (with corresponding
95% CI), including sex, race, and cardiovascular fitness
level. Percentages are based on the weighted frequencies.
The association between row (race or race­sex groups) and
column variables (cardiovascular fitness level) was ana-
lyzed using the Rao­Scott W2 test for proportions. Statistical
significance was established at ! = 0.05 a priori.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the 1978 adults included in the sample,
along with the corresponding population-based estimates,
are provided in Table 3. The sex distribution of the sample
was similar to that of the population (Table 3A), whereas
the race distribution was approximately 29% Mexican-
American, 20% non-Hispanic black, and 51% non-Hispan-
ic white. As shown in Table 3B, non-Hispanic white
subjects were significantly older (P G 0.017) than the other
race groups. Similarly, non-Hispanic white males and
females were significantly older than their Mexican-
American counterparts (P G 0.008). Estimated V
 O2max
was significantly lower (P G 0.017) among non-Hispanic
black than Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white adults.
Estimated V
 O2max
was also significantly lower (P G 0.008)
among non-Hispanic black females than Mexican-American
and non-Hispanic white females, but there were no differ-
ences among males. Finally, BMI was significantly lower
(P G 0.017) among non-Hispanic white than non-Hispanic
black and Mexican-American adults, and BMI was lower
(P G 0.008) in non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American
females than non-Hispanic black females.
For each sex and age category, the revised cut-points
based on NHANES data shown in Table 2 were slightly
higher than those based on the cut-points derived from
ACLS data (Table 1). Figure 1A shows the distribution of
cardiovascular fitness levels by race, as reported by us
previously (7), and Figure 1B shows the distribution of
cardiovascular fitness levels by race based on the revised
cut-points. There was a significant association between
race and cardiovascular fitness level (P G 0.0001),
regardless of the cut-points used. Although the percentage
of individuals in the low fitness category was higher in all
race groups based on NHANES (new) compared with
ACLS (old) cut-points, this difference was greatest among
non-Hispanic black adults. Using the NHANES cut-points,
31.9% (95% CI: 26.0­37.8%) of non-Hispanic black adults
were categorized as having a low cardiovascular fitness
level compared with approximately 23% using the ACLS
cut-points.

levels by race­sex groups, as reported previously (7), and

levels by race­sex groups based on the revised cut-points.

There was a significant association between race and
cardiovascular fitness level for each sex (P G 0.0001),
regardless of the cut-points used. The percentage of
individuals in the low fitness category was also higher for
all race­sex groups based on the NHANES-derived cut-
points compared with the ACLS-derived cut-points. This
difference was greatest among non-Hispanic black men;
29% of non-Hispanic black men had a low fitness level using
NHANES compared with 15% using ACLS cut-points.
However, the absolute percentage of individuals catego-
rized as having a low cardiovascular fitness level was still
highest among non-Hispanic black women; 35% using the
NHANES compared with 31% using the ACLS derived
cut-points.

DISCUSSION
The cardiovascular fitness component was implemented
in NHANES in 1999 to provide nationally representative
data on cardiovascular fitness among the noninstitutional-
ized U.S. population. One purpose in doing so was to
establish prevalence estimates for specific groups that may
be at increased health risk due to poor cardiovascular
fitness. We recently reported that non-Hispanic black
adults, and non-Hispanic black women in particular, had
lower cardiovascular fitness than other groups in the
United States (7). We found no evidence to support our
earlier suggestion that differences in the distribution of
low, moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness among the

presented as a percentage T SE.

various groups might have been caused by a potential for
bias or misclassification because the cut-points used to
categorize and report fitness levels in NHANES were
derived from the ACLS, which was composed of a mostly
non-Hispanic white sample. Despite using revised cut-
points to establish cardiovascular fitness levels that were
derived from NHANES, which is composed of a more
representative sample of the U.S. population, we still found
that non-Hispanic black adults, and non-Hispanic black
women in particular, had the highest percentage of low
cardiovascular fitness, compared with their Mexican-
American and non-Hispanic white counterparts. In fact,
the percentage of non-Hispanic black adults and non-
Hispanic black women who had a low cardiovascular
fitness level was actually higher in the present study
compared with our earlier report (7).
As depicted in the figures, the distribution of low,
moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness differed substan-
tially among the various race and race­sex groups. This
difference was most apparent among females, with roughly
35% of non-Hispanic black women categorized has having
a low cardiovascular fitness level, compared with 22% of
Mexican-American and 18% of non-Hispanic white wom-
en. Thus, on a population basis, over one third of all non-
Hispanic black women likely have a low cardiovascular
fitness level. The present report supports our earlier
findings and provides further evidence that non-Hispanic
black women in particular may be at increased health risk
due to poor cardiovascular fitness. This suggests a need for
health promotion specialists to target efforts toward
increasing cardiovascular fitness among non-Hispanic
black women to help decrease the prevalence of low
fitness in this group. This suggestion is supported by recent
efforts of public health professionals in Richmond, VA, to
engage relatively high-risk residents (who were dispropor-
tionately African American and female, had higher BMI
levels, and were more likely to report a family history of
chronic disease compared with the general community)
into a multipronged intervention focused on dietary change
and increased physical activity levels (15).
There are a number of important limitations in the
present study. First, the estimates for the distribution of
cardiovascular fitness levels in the population were derived
from estimated V
 O2max
values based on submaximal
exercise testing. There is error involved with estimated
V
 O2max
from this type of testing because the results are
based on extrapolation to HRmax
established from a
theoretical formula. In addition, errors in this estimate
may be compounded by any factor that influences the HR
response to exercise (e.g., temperature and stress) or the
measurement of HR itself (e.g., equipment used to measure
HR). Second, the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES
survey does not allow us to make causal inferences as to
the underlying reason(s) for the higher percentage of non-
Hispanic black adults who have a low cardiovascular
fitness level compared with other major race groups in
the United States. Potential explanatory factors might
include differences in BMI, income, physical activity level,
and body composition, all of which will be explored in our
future studies. Third, it should be noted that these findings
might not be generalizable to all U.S. adults because of the
select age and physical status of the sample examined.
Finally, by excluding participants categorized as ``other
Hispanics'' and ``other races, including multiracial,'' we
are unable to provide a precise estimate of estimated
V
 O2max
(and fitness level distribution) for ``all races''
combined.
The goal of this article was to present the distribution of
cardiovascular fitness levels among various race groups in
the United States using appropriate cut-points that were
derived from national estimates of V
 O2max
(estimated from
submaximal exercise). In turn, the established cut-points
might be used to categorize and report cardiovascular fitness
levels of adults in the U.S. population for health risk
assessment purposes. Despite the limitations noted, the
reference standards presented in this article should provide
a more representative estimate of cardiovascular fitness
levels among U.S. adults, which in turn might be useful as
an evaluation tool for health care providers and other
professionals.
