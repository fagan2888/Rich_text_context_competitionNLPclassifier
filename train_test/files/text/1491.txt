ABSTRACT What makes some states more militarily powerful than others? A
growing body of research suggests that certain `non-material' factors significantly
affect a country's ability to translate resources into fighting power. In particular,
recent studies claim that democracy, Western culture, high levels of human
capital, and amicable civil-military relations enhance military effectiveness. If
these studies are correct, then military power is not solely or even primarily
determined by material resources, and a large chunk of international relations
scholarship has been based on a flawed metric. The major finding of this article,
however, suggests that this is not the case. In hundreds of battles between 1898
and 1987, the more economically developed side consistently outfought the
poorer side on a soldier-for-soldier basis. This is not surprising. What is
surprising is that many of the non-material factors posited to affect military
capability seem to be irrelevant: when economic development is taken into
account, culture and human capital become insignificant and democracy actually
seems to degrade warfighting capability. In short, the conventional military
dominance of Western democracies stems from superior economic development,
not societal pathologies or political institutions. Therefore, a conception of
military power that takes into account both the quantity of a state's resources
and its level of economic development provides a sound basis for defense
planning and international relations scholarship.

What makes some states more militarily powerful than others? The vast
majority of international relations studies and defense analyses assume
that military power is a direct product of material resources, often
measured in terms of the size of a state's defense budget, military forces,
or gross domestic product (GDP). A growing body of research,
however, claims that certain non-material factors significantly affect

the ability of states to translate their resources into fighting power. In
particular, recent studies suggest that democratic political institutions,
Western culture, high levels of human capital, and amicable civil-
military relations significantly enhance the creation of military power.
If this is true, then military power is not solely or even primarily
determined by material resources, and the large number of theoretical
and empirical works based on this assumption are flawed.
Neither of these two views is entirely correct. Purely materialist
conceptions of military power are unsound because they ignore military
effectiveness. Some states consistently excel at turning hard assets into
military power, others display endemic weaknesses, and still others
exhibit variations in their warfighting capabilities over time. In short, a
state's level of military power depends not only upon the size of its
resource endowments, but how well it uses those resources for military
purposes. The materialist view only takes the former into account and,
as a result, fundamentally misrepresents military capability.
Yet, the alternative view ­ that military capability is, to a significant
extent, a product of political and social factors ­ also suffers from a
major shortcoming. In particular, every study in this body of scholar-
ship overlooks the most crucial ingredient of military power: economic
development. This omission is especially troubling because Western
democracies with high levels of human capital and low levels of civil-
military frictions also rank among the most economically developed
states in the world. It is entirely plausible, therefore, that the
correlations found between these political and social factors and
military effectiveness are spurious.
The major empirical finding of this article suggests that this is indeed
the case. In hundreds of battles and wars between 1898 and 1987,
states with higher levels of economic development consistently
outfought less developed opponents. This is not surprising. What is
surprising is that many of the political and social factors posited to
affect military capability either seem to be irrelevant or have the
opposite effect of that found in previous studies: when economic
development is taken into account, culture and human capital become
insignificant and democracy actually degrades warfighting capability.
In short, the conventional military dominance of Western democracies
stems primarily from superior levels of economic development, not
societal pathologies or political institutions.
This finding qualifies both of the major views of military power. For
the traditional materialist view, this article suggests that a country's
degree of development ­ not just the size of its economy, defense
budget, or military ­ is an important ingredient for military success. In
other words, military power is a function of both quantity and quality;
states of comparable size may still differ in their level of military power
44 Michael Beckley
because economically developed states field more effective forces. For
the alternative view, these findings suggest that military power is rooted
in a state's economy rather than its political institutions, culture, or
education system. While economic development may not be the only
determinant of military effectiveness, it seems to be the primary
determinant. Therefore, a conception of military power that accounts
for both the quantity of a state's resources and its level of economic
development provides a sound basis for defense planning and
international relations scholarship.
For the study of international relations, few topics could be more
fundamental. Military power is widely considered to be the most
important variable in international relations because it functions as a
decisive arbiter of disputes when it is used, and shapes relationships
among states even when it is not. Empirical studies have found that
military power influences patterns of international cooperation, trade
policy, economic development, identity construction, and, of course,
war causation and termination. Moreover, much of international
relations theory essentially boils down to a debate about the extent to
which military power affects state behavior. Yet few academics have
attempted to develop a sound conception of military power or to
rigorously explore its determinants. Without such an analysis, the study
of international relations lacks a foundation upon which to base
broader theoretical and empirical claims. This article seeks to provide
such a foundation.
Understanding what makes some countries more militarily powerful
than others is also important for prudent policymaking. Take, for
example, the security implications of China's rapid economic develop-
ment. If economic development is the key ingredient for an effective
military, then the growth of China's economy is synonymous with the
expansion of its military potential. But if China's authoritarian political
institutions or non-Western culture systematically undermine its ability
to turn resources into military power, then the security threat posed by
its economic rise may be less menacing than many people assume. Since
vital decisions regarding grand strategy, alliance commitments, threat
assessment, military doctrine, budget allocation, and the use of force
are based on such determinations, the study of military power deserves
the most incisive and rigorous research that modern scholarship can
provide.
Most importantly, accurate military assessments help prevent foolish
wars. Wars are fought over a variety of issues, but most share a
fundamental cause: false optimism.1 Disputes escalate to wars when
both sides believe they can use force to accomplish political objectives

at acceptable costs, or in other words, when both sides think they can
win. Of course, few wars in history have been win-win affairs, meaning
that at least one side in just about every war ­ and very often both
sides ­ underestimated the strength of the enemy and ended up paying
an excessive price in blood and treasure as a result. In short, erroneous
estimates of military power cause wars, therefore accurately con-
ceptualizing and measuring military power increases the likelihood of
peace.
This paper proceeds in four sections. The first section reviews the
literature on the determinants of military power. The second section
outlines a theory relating economic development to military effective-
ness and derives several testable hypotheses. The third section tests
these hypotheses and finds that economic development best explains
military outcomes. The fourth section discusses the implications of
these findings.
The Study of Military Power
The existing literature offers two main answers to the central question
of this article: why are some states more militarily powerful than
others? The first and most prevalent hypothesis is that military power is
a direct function of material resources. Many of the classic realist texts,
for example, consider the relative quantity of material resources ­
troops, defense expenditures, GDP, population, industrial base ­ to be
the main determinant of state behavior.2 Liberals and constructivists
often conceptualize military power in material terms when refuting its
causal significance.3 And the most widely used measure of military
capability in quantitative studies ­ the Composite Indicator of National
Capability ­ is an index of six material variables: military expenditure,
military personnel, energy consumption, iron and steel production,
urban population, and total population.4 Quite simply, a large chunk

of international relations scholarship rests on the assumption that
material indicators provide accurate proxies for military power.
Materialist conceptions of military power also dominate policy
analyses and military operations research in the US Department of
Defense and in many other Western governments.5 Mathematical
models and computer simulations of combat draw heavily on
technological and numerical indicators of military power, while placing
much less emphasis on intangible factors, such as leadership and force
employment, and ignoring political and social variables altogether.6
Military units are assessed by means of head-to-head numerical force
comparisons, and the most common rule of thumb in defense analyses
is that successful attack requires at least a 3:1 local superiority of troops
or a 1.5:1 theater-wide advantage.7 While a plethora of sophisticated
indicators ­ such as force densities, attrition coefficients, and `firepower
scores' ­ have been employed, the vast majority are essentially measures
of material assets, either in terms of manpower or firepower.
Other studies, however, have shown persuasively that these material
indicators fail to predict or explain actual combat outcomes. In
numerous wars and individual battles, sides with fewer resources have
outfought and defeated materially preponderant enemies. Prior to the
1991 Gulf War, military analysts employed the best available net
assessment methods to predict casualty ratios, but the best over-
estimated American losses by a factor of three; the next best was off by
a factor of six; and the majority were off by more than an order of
magnitude.8 These types of failures motivate an alternative conception

of military power that takes into account not only the quantity of a
state's material resources, but also how well it uses those resources in
battle.
Stephen Biddle, for example, argues that militaries that employ what
he calls the `modern system' ­ a tightly interrelated complex of cover,
concealment, dispersion, suppression, small-unit independent maneu-
ver, and combined arms at the tactical level, and depth, reserves, and
differential concentration at the operational level ­ are more likely to
carry out successful operations, even against materially preponderant
enemies.9 Similarly, Colonel Trevor N. Dupuy stressed the role of less
tangible factors, such as morale, leadership, and training, in his
influential models and writings on military power.10 And political
science studies find that strategy, doctrine, and tactical force employ-
ment have decisive effects on combat outcomes.11
The key point made by all of these studies is that the manner in which
military force is employed mediates the relationship between material
strength and military power. Simplistic `bean counts' of weapons and
troops are poor measures of modern military capability. More
fundamental to such assessments are the quality of equipment, the
skill of the soldiers, and the degree and efficiency of organization. A
state's military power, therefore, is a function of two things: its stock of
material resources and how well it can translate those resources into
force, a capability often referred to as `military effectiveness'. Military
effectiveness thus provides the crucial link between materiel and
military power, between what a state's resources suggest it could do
and what it actually can do in war.
This point about effectiveness is not inherently incompatible with the
traditional materialist view. For example, when realists refer to states
as billiard balls or `like-units', they imply that different countries tend
to generate the same amount of military power from a given level of
resources. Over time, according to this logic, the pressures exerted by
the anarchical international system demonstrate what forms of
Commanders (New York: Simon & Schuster 1991), 349; Tom Matthews, `The
Secret History of the War', Newsweek, 18 March 1991, 28ff.

behavior succeed and fail, and by that means either socialize all states
into a common set of military practices or eliminate those that fall by
the wayside.12 Since states use materiel optimally, the materiel itself is
the only relevant source of military power. Thus, traditional concep-
tions of military power do not necessarily ignore effectiveness, they just
do not assign it a causal role independent from material resources.
Recent studies, however, suggest that a host of political and social
factors may systematically degrade or enhance a state's military
effectiveness, thereby causing some wealthy states to squander their
resources, while allowing some poor states to generate inordinate
amounts of force.13 Material factors may represent a state's potential
level of military power, but non-material factors significantly affect its
actual level of military power. It follows from this view that the largest
or wealthiest states, or even the states with the highest defense budgets,
do not necessarily possess the most military might.
To date, this research has focused on four variables ­ regime-type,
culture, civil-military relations, and human capital ­ though other
factors such as ethnic divisions and international relationships have
also received attention. Concerning regime-type, Dan Reiter and Allan
C. Stam find that democracies win more battles than non-democracies
and explain these results by producing statistical evidence linking
democratic political institutions to superior leadership and initiative on
the battlefield.14
Other scholars claim that culture shapes military performance, either
because armies reflect the norms and structures of their societies, or
because efforts taken to divorce militaries from their societies have
consequences for the amount of usable military power available to the
state. For example, Ruth Benedict linked the ferocious, suicidal
defenses of Japan during World War II to Japanese concepts of
honor and shame.15 More recently, Kenneth Pollack argued that Arab
cultural pathologies explain Arab militaries' poor tactical initiative,
weak combined arms practices, intelligence failures, inability to
perform tactical maneuvers, and systematic displays of individual
bravery.16 This finding is partially supported by Stephen Biddle and
Stephen Long's quantitative analysis, in which the authors find that

states with Muslim and Buddhist cultures perform poorly in battles
against Western adversaries.17
Several studies suggest that the nature of a state's civil-military
relations has decisive impacts on the amount of military power it can
produce. In countries in which civil-military relations are rancorous
and combative, civilian leaders may adopt self-defensive measures that
purposefully undermine the military's unity and proficiency. Such
interventions include purges of the officer corps and promotion of
officers on the basis of loyalty rather than merit, suppression of
communications, isolation from foreign sources of expertise or
training, and encouragement of divisions within and among different
services. These policies may help insulate the regime from military
coups, but they systematically reduce the will and capacity of soldiers
to pursue apolitical military proficiency.18
The final non-material determinant of military effectiveness to
receive scholarly attention is human capital. Stephen Biddle and
Stephen Long hypothesize that better-educated soldiers may be more
receptive to training, more adept at operating and maintaining
sophisticated machinery, and more capable of executing tactical
maneuvers on the battlefield. In support of this hypothesis, the authors
find that developed states with high levels of primary and secondary
education outperform less educated enemies on the battlefield.
Taken together, these studies suggest that Western democratic states
with low levels of civil-military friction, and high levels of human
capital, should be soldier-for-soldier, dollar-for-dollar more militarily
powerful than states that lack these characteristics. The potential
implications of these findings are immense, not only for the study of
military power, but for the entire field of international relations: if
political and social factors decisively shape the creation of military
power, then the large number of academic theories and policy
assessments based on materialist conceptions of military power may
be seriously flawed. According to Stephen Biddle, `an enormous
scholarly edifice thus rests on very shaky foundations' because `the
standard measures of military capability at the heart of all this are
actually no better than coin flips at predicting real military outcomes'.19

These recent studies have made major contributions by highlighting
the importance of military effectiveness and by providing several
potential explanations of why some states, at some times, fight better
than others. The literature, however, still suffers from three short-
comings.
First, there is no comprehensive theory that can explain and
predict the military effectiveness, and therefore the military power,
of particular states. A review of the literature suggests that Western
democracies with educated populations and low levels of internal
conflict should fight particularly well, but few countries possess all of
these attributes or lack them entirely. Instead most states, including
many of the major powers today (e.g. Russia, Japan, China, India,
Brazil) fall somewhere in-between these two extremes, possessing
some but not all of the ostensible ingredients for military success. In
order to develop our understanding of military power, therefore, we
need to know not only which factors matter, but how much each
one matters in relation to others. In general, the existing literature
has succeeded in the first of these tasks, but has come up short with
respect to the latter: only one of the studies discussed above (Biddle
and Long 2004) tests multiple factors together across a large number
of cases.
Second, the relationship between materiel and military power has not
been properly tested. Some scholars have attempted to discredit
materialist conceptions of military power by examining war and
battlefield outcomes. The battlefield analyses to date, however, have
been biased against material hypotheses, and war outcomes cannot be
used to assess military power in the first place.
Concerning war outcomes, several scholars have pointed out that the
materially weaker side has won about half of all wars in the modern
era.20 This fact, however, only highlights that wars are political events
not solely determined by military power, not that military power has a
non-material basis. When wars break out, the belligerents tend to be
closely matched in some combination of capability and resolve because
factors that systematically increase the likelihood of victory for one side
make war less likely in the first place.21 In other words, there is a
natural overrepresentation of wars in which one side's material
superiority is mitigated by the other side's superiority in resolve. Thus
we should not be surprised when material factors `perform no better

than a coin toss' at predicting war outcomes because the political
outcomes of most wars are, in fact, coin tosses.
With respect to battle outcomes, Stephen Biddle finds that several
material indicators do not predict casualty ratios.22 These results,
however, do not constitute fair tests of the relationship between
materiel and military power, because casualty ratios measure the
quality of a state's military units while the material indicators tested
measure its quantity of resources. There is little reason to expect
numerical superiority to correlate with soldier-for-soldier quality. In
fact, it is more common for states with large armies and populations to
substitute sheer mass for military effectiveness. For example, in both
World Wars many Russian soldiers were sent into battle without rifles
because Russia had an abundance of manpower but a scarcity of
capital.23 This imbalance did not mean that Russia was militarily weak,
just that victory required tremendous human sacrifice. As the old
Finnish saying goes: `Each Finnish soldier is worth ten Russian soldiers,
but what happens when the eleventh Russian shows up?'24 To conduct
a fair test of the relationship between material factors and military
effectiveness, therefore, it is necessary to weight a state's absolute level
of resources by the population over which those resources are
distributed. This can be accomplished by using indicators such as
per-capita GDP or military spending per soldier. Unfortunately, no
existing study of battlefield effectiveness has done so.
Third, and most importantly, the current body of research
overlooks a critical determinant of effectiveness: economic develop-
ment. Politically stable, Western democracies with high levels of
human capital also tend to be economically prosperous. It is
distinctly possible, therefore, that the correlations found between
these political and social variables and military effectiveness reflect a
more general connection between economic development and
military power. Yet none of the studies described above considers
this possibility or controls for economic development. A few studies
examine the link between development and mobilization capacity
and find that (at least in the World Wars) economically developed
states successfully produce and deliver more resources to the
22Biddle also uses territorial gain as a dependent variable, but the results are mixed. In
particular, he finds that the defender's force-to-space ratio has a significant effect on the
attacker's ability to gain territory. As he points out, this result is consistent with
materialist conceptions of military power. See, Biddle, Military Power, 170­3.

battlefield than poorer states.25 But this insight only links develop-
ment to quantities of military resources; it does not explain
variations in the quality of those resources.
We now come to the central argument of this study: military
effectiveness is primarily a product of economic development. In
particular, economically developed states tend to possess more
sophisticated and reliable equipment and more skilled military
personnel than less developed states. These two qualitative advantages,
of equipment and skill, translate directly into military superiority. The
next section expands on this argument while the subsequent section
tests it empirically.
Economic Development and Military Effectiveness
The essence of economic development is efficiency of production. The
higher a state's level of economic development, by definition, the more
efficiently its workers produce goods and services. There may be a
natural tendency to view civilian and military realms as separate
entities, but militaries are actually embedded within economic systems.
Thus, countries that excel in producing civilian goods and services also
tend to excel in producing military force.26 In particular, economic
development improves a state's ability to produce high-quality military
equipment and skillful military personnel.
This theory goes beyond the traditional materialist view, which only
links military effectiveness to defense spending and implies that poor,
technologically backward states can still piece together powerful
militaries by stealing or purchasing arms from abroad and channeling
investment into defense at home. As the subsequent discussion and
empirical tests make clear, however, the relationship between economic
development and military effectiveness extends far beyond sums of
money.

Heath Lexington Books 1970); Klaus Knorr, The War Potential of Nations (Princeton
UP 1956).
26Obviously economically developed countries may, for various reasons, decide not to
invest in military power. The point here is that given a fixed quantity of resources
devoted to defense, economically developed states will produce more effective forces
and therefore be more militarily powerful than less developed states. In other words,
this paper is not about whether states have an interest in military power, but rather
whether they have the capacity to produce and employ it.
Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 53
Equipment
Innovations occur sporadically in all societies, but only economically
developed states are capable of sustained technological progress. The
institutional foundation of economic growth ­ secure and enforceable
property rights ­ encourages the creation and application of new
innovations, while high levels of commerce and mobility facilitate their
dissemination. Developed economies also posses the financial capital to
fund technological innovation, and the production capacity to
manufacture equipment in large quantities. As industries within an
economy become more advanced, they increasingly benefit from
economies of scale that diminish the unit costs of production and,
therefore, increase the likelihood that new innovations, including
military innovations, will be developed and adopted.
This capacity for sustained technological progress translates into
technological supremacy in battle, as evidenced most clearly by the
history of colonialism. Consider that in 1850, Great Britain's GDP was
only half that of India's, yet Britain's fourfold advantage in economic
development (as measured by per capita income) translated into vastly
superior weapons and organization, which in turn facilitated
political domination.27 Throughout this period technological asymme-
tries resulted in extremely one-sided military outcomes. For example, in
1898 during the Battle of Omdurman, a British-led army used Maxim
guns and Lee-Enfield rifles to cut down 11,000 Dervishes for the loss of
only 49 of its own troops.28
Even when two sides possess similar types of equipment, those
possessed by economically developed states tend to be of higher
quality. For example, the original designs for the American M1 tank
and the Soviet T-72 entered production within ten years of each other.
The M1, however, was produced by the most vibrant economy on earth
while the T-72 emerged from a stagnant, technologically backwards
society. The resulting `tank gap' was never exploited during the Cold
War, but it was made manifest during the 1991 Gulf War.29 While
US tank rounds had no problem penetrating Iraqi T-72s from distances

up to 3,700 meters, Iraqi T-72 rounds ­ some of which were fired from
within 500 meters ­ often failed to damage American tanks or even
slow them down.30 Soviet fighter aircraft similarly lagged far behind
those of the United States. When a Soviet pilot, seeking asylum, flew his
MiG-25 to Japan in 1976, inspectors on the ground found it was devoid
of any next-generation technologies and described it as basically a
`rocket with a window'.31
These technological deficiencies did not stem from a lack of funding ­
throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the USSR allocated 2­3 per cent of its
entire gross national product to military research and development32 ­
but rather from economic underdevelopment.
In considering technological superiority, moreover, it is important
not to fixate solely on weapons platforms. Advantages in communica-
tions, intelligence, medical care, and logistics can have decisive impacts
on military outcomes. For example, American victory in the Pacific
campaigns of World War II was due in no small part to the ability of US
soldiers to stay healthy while Japanese forces were decimated by
disease. Moreover, the historically low loss rate in the 1991 Gulf War
can be partially explained by the decisive American advantage in
intelligence systems, including its constellation of global positioning
system (GPS)-based navigation systems, Joint Surveillance and Target
Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aerial surveillance radar, satellites, and
spy-planes.
While states can purchase advanced technologies from others, only
developed economies possess the technological industry and skilled
workforce necessary to modernize them. For example, in the mid-
1930s, Fascist Italy was spending more on defense than Britain, France,
or the United States, yet this massive military investment lacked a solid
economic foundation. In 1938, Italy possessed only 2.8 per cent of the
world manufacturing production, produced only 2.1 per cent of its
steel, and had a per capita income equal to that achieved by Britain in
the middle of the nineteenth century.33 Without a vibrant technology
sector or a robust industrial infrastructure, Italy was incapable of
keeping pace with vital military developments and entered World War

II with obsolete equipment: Italian biplanes flew at half the speed of
Allied aircraft while Italian tanks, weighing a mere 3.5 tons and armed
with two machine guns, were no match for Allied tanks that weighed
20 tons and had much heavier weaponry.34 Shackled to such outdated
technology, it is little wonder that the Italian Army was routed in the
North Africa campaign.
Even if underdeveloped states obtain the `teeth' of a technologically
sophisticated military, they may not possess the `tail' needed to
support it.35 Poor countries may, for example, purchase modern tanks
and aircraft but lack the spare parts or the technicians to keep them
running. These two deficiencies, of supplies and trained personnel,
often go hand-in-hand and reinforce each other, creating a problem one
scholar termed `the logistic snowball': a state with meager supplies
needs to use what it has efficiently, but it is poor in the first place
precisely because it is incapable of operating efficiently. Thus,
accomplishing a given task requires more personnel, who in turn
require more resources and personnel to transport, house, feed, and
manage them, and so on.36
Finally, militaries often rely directly on civilian equipment, supplies,
and techniques. For example, in 1973 Israeli milk trucks carried
ammunition across the Suez Canal, and El Al's passenger planes
delivered high-priority spare parts and ammunition.37 Today, the
American military depends on private companies to provide logistical
services and to produce information technologies, such as fiber optic-
laced clothing, head-mounted computer displays, global satellite
phones, impromptu wireless networks, and rugged laptop computers.
Two of the most important modern weapons systems, stealth and
multispectral technologies, depend on innovative manufacturing and
design technologies that reside in the commercial sector, and three-
quarters of the computing power in the Aegis cruiser depends on
commercial equipment.38 In these respects, a solid economic infra-
structure enhances military effectiveness during wars, as well as in the
periods that precede them.
In earlier eras, copying and imitation through espionage were viable
options for laggard states seeking to catch up with technological

leaders. In the early 1900s, it only took three years for Germany to
copy and produce its own version of the British super battleship HMS
Dreadnought. The first US detonation of a nuclear weapon in 1945 was
followed by a Soviet detonation only four years later. Today, however,
military technologies are much more difficult to copy because they are
not stand-alone pieces of hardware. Military power used to consist
primarily of weapons platforms and troops; today it is comprised of
systems, which link weapons and troops to sensors, satellites, and
command centers. Countries may be able to purchase certain aspects of
these systems from abroad, but only developed states will have the
supporting infrastructure necessary to assimilate state-of-the-art
military technologies and integrate them into a cohesive, lethal whole.
Skill
Military effectiveness also requires skill. As Stephen Biddle has pointed
out, the extreme lethality of modern weapons makes exposed mass
movement on the battlefield suicidal. To survive in such an environ-
ment, military units must master demanding tactical schemes that allow
them to accomplish military missions while simultaneously minimizing
their exposure to enemy firepower.39 Skill is also crucial at the
operational level. Officers must be able to synthesize a host of factors ­
the mission, the strength and objectives of the enemy, terrain, weather,
etc. ­ and make decisions regarding strategy, doctrine, and tactics that
maximize the power of their forces. Moreover, leaders must continually
assess military units and improve operational plans and training
programs accordingly. For example, after defeating Poland in World
War II, the German military leadership critically examined its own
forces and instituted organizational changes. This process produced a
much more effective fighting force and facilitated the subsequent
drubbing of France in May and June 1940.40
In addition, military effectiveness hinges upon the quality of
administrative decisions regarding military organization and structure.
Successfully coordinating, supplying, and transporting forces in
theaters of combat requires not just trained soldiers but also talented
managers and brainy analysts to determine and implement the most
effective distribution of manpower, equipment, and expenditures. In
this regard, scientific techniques, such as operations research and
systems analysis, provide a foundation of rigorously derived knowledge
upon which sound operational decisions can be made.

Professionalism', Armed Forces and Society 7/2 (Winter 1981), 285­98.
Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 57
Skill, however, is an extremely perishable commodity. Each
successive class of soldiers must receive rigorous training, and existing
units must drill continually to prevent atrophy. Basic training for a
typical soldier may only take a few months, but training officers to lead
them takes years and requires a system of military academies to
disseminate military know-how and breed trust within the ranks.41
Furthermore, an effective military administration requires a robust
infrastructure of government, academic, and private research institu-
tions, as well as a constant supply of human capital to staff them. The
key point is that militaries need sustained investment to remain
effective because it is extremely difficult to develop or rebuild skills
once lost.
Supporting a large military establishment for a long period of time,
however, may reduce the rate of economic growth and therefore the
wealth needed for future military power. States throughout history
have faced the dilemma of balancing the short-term security afforded
by large defense budgets against the longer-term security of rising
wealth. But this predicament is far less acute for economically
developed states that can produce effective militaries while devoting a
relatively small percentage of their economic resources to defense.
In addition, superior economic efficiency lowers the unit costs of
weapons and supplies, thereby providing soldiers more opportunities
to train with them, and more opportunities for administrators to test
new weapons and determine their feasibility for full deployment.42
By contrast, underdeveloped states may not be able to afford wasting
ammunition and supplies on training and testing, or be able to pay
and retain skilled soldiers in peacetime. For example, the Soviet
MiG-21 fighter aircraft received overhauls at triple the rate of many
Western aircraft, and Soviet T-62 tank engines reportedly wore out
completely after 500 hours or less of use. As a result, the Soviet
military was forced to keep its weapons `packed away like a family's
best china', using them only for special exercises once or twice a
year.43
Economically developed states are also more likely to have skilled
military administrations. As incomes rise, education systems expand,
thereby enlarging the pool of human capital from which to assemble

a competent bureaucracy.44 Moreover, a dynamic economy provides
many opportunities to develop managerial skills, which can then be
transferred to militarily relevant industries and organizations.
Economically developed states are also more likely to possess the
technological capacity for rigorous data analysis and communication.
In short, skillfully run economies beget skillfully run militaries. As
Eliot Cohen has argued, the few cases of poor states successfully
administering military operations (e.g. North Vietnam) are `the
exception that proves the rule' because poor states `almost by
definition face an acute shortage of the kind of managerial expertise
needed'.45
Finally, economic development mitigates political constraints that
impede the generation of military skill. Some studies have noted that
internal political discord significantly reduces military effectiveness by
eroding trust among soldiers from different societal groups or by
causing regimes to purposefully undermine the military's unity and
proficiency. Prosperous states, however, are far less likely to be afflicted
by such schisms. It is an empirical fact that economically developed
states experience fewer coups than less developed states. In fact, no
democracy has ever fallen in a country with a per capita income above
$6,055.46 Moreover, at least four studies have found that higher per
capita incomes significantly reduce the likelihood of civil wars.47 As
the World Bank concluded in 2003 after four years of research on the
topic: `the key root cause of (internal) conflict is the failure of economic
development'. In short, economically developed states are far more
likely to have political environments conducive to the development of
military proficiency.

Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 59
Endogenous Development
The preceding point highlights the fact that economic development is
itself partly a product of political and social factors. One might even
argue that development is an outcome of democracy, civil-military
relations, human capital, or culture. If this were true, then we would
find an association between economic development and military
effectiveness, not because economic development is the primary
determinant of effectiveness, but because development serves either as
a proxy for these political and social factors or as an intervening
variable between them and military effectiveness.
The latter possibility, however, is somewhat beside the point
because existing studies of military effectiveness claim that political
and social factors directly shape the creation of military power, not
that they do so indirectly through their effects on economic
development. Thus, even if economic development were largely an
outcome of culture, regime-type, human capital, or civil-military
relations, that does not refute the claim that development directly
shapes military effectiveness.
More importantly, it is doubtful that economic development is a
product primarily of one or some combination of these four factors. For
instance, there is no hard evidence that amiable civil-military relations
are a precondition for economic development. By contrast, it has been
found that economic downturns precipitate civil-military antagonisms
because, among other reasons, they often result in significant cuts in
defense spending.48 As noted above, the best predictor of regime
survival and internal order is high per capita incomes. To the extent
that wealth insulates regimes from internal threats and allows them to
focus on external enemies, it seems plausible that civil-military comity
actually constitutes one of the causal mechanisms through which
economic development enhances military power.
Similarly, there is no consensus that democracy promotes economic
growth. While democratic institutions may help secure property rights
by constraining rulers, they may also unleash popular demands for
consumption or empower interest groups to force through inefficient
redistributions of resources.49 This theoretical uncertainty is reflected in
the empirical record. In a review of existing studies on the issue, eight
conclude that democracy facilitates economic growth, eight argue that

dictatorship increases growth, and five studies find that regime-type
makes no difference.50 A subsequent study by Robert Barro also failed
to find clear empirical support either way.51 Finally, the reverse
argument, that economic development causes democratization, has
been around for decades (modernization theory) and recently received
statistical support.52
Debates over the relationship between culture and economic growth
are similarly unresolved. At least since Max Weber's The Protestant
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism in 1920, groups of scholars
have argued that culture drives economic performance.53 According
to this view, certain societies have systems of attitudes, values, and
knowledge that facilitate economic growth. Others, however, respond
that attributing economic and political outcomes to culture mistakes
cause for effect. These scholars maintain that coherent configurations
of attitudes across broad groups of citizens rarely exist, and when they
do, they do not persist for long periods of time. Moreover, some of the
findings linking culture to political and economic performance were
revealed to be results of statistical errors or omitted variable bias.54
Finally, the fact that many of today's fastest growing economies include
a diverse array of cultures casts doubt on the argument that economic
development is culturally determined.
Higher levels of human capital almost certainly facilitate economic
growth, but only certain types are essential. While trained scientists are
obviously required for indigenous technological innovation, economic
growth does not necessarily require that the population at large be

highly educated.55 After all, Great Britain, the most economically
developed state in 1850 and the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution,
was far from being the best educated, most literate, or best-endowed in
human capital.56 Perhaps for this reason, some studies have found that
the economic returns to education are not especially high.57 Finally,
human capital is itself endogenous to growth. As a recent study has
shown, the initial level of income is a strong predictor of subsequent
growth in education, likely because more developed countries can
afford more robust systems of education.58
In sum, economic development is related to, but distinct from,
human capital, civil-military relations, democracy, and culture. It
follows that studies of military effectiveness can and should test these
factors together. Not only is economic development a potentially
crucial determinant of effectiveness, but previous findings, concerning
the effects of democracy, culture, human capital, and civil-military
relations, cannot be verified until alternative explanations, such as
economic development, have been controlled for. At this point, we can
derive several testable hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. States with higher levels of economic development
should perform more effectively on the battlefield than less
developed states.
Confirmation of this hypothesis does not imply that economic
development is all that matters, it merely suggests that economic
development is one of several important determinants of military
effectiveness.
A stronger claim would be that economic development is the primary
determinant of military effectiveness. According to this view, correla-
tions found by previous studies between political and social variables
and military effectiveness are spurious. Western democracies with high
levels of human capital and low levels of civil-military friction fight
better simply because they tend to be more economically developed
than states that lack these characteristics.

Hypothesis 2. After controlling for economic development,
regime-type, culture, human capital, and civil-military relations
should not associate strongly with performance on the battlefield.
Finally, some earlier studies used the level of defense spending per
soldier as a proxy for the quality of military forces.59 This association
of defense spending with military effectiveness is consistent with the
traditional view that military capability is a function of material
resources. The preceding discussion, however, suggests that the benefits
of superior economic development go beyond merely having more
money to invest in the military. In particular, economically developed
states are more likely to have robust technological infrastructures,
large-scale production capacities, skillful personnel, and stable political
environments, which may enhance effectiveness independent of the
level of defense spending.
Hypothesis 3. States with higher levels of economic development
should perform more effectively on the battlefield than less
developed states, even after controlling for the level of military
spending.
Empirical Analysis
The empirical analyses below test these three hypotheses by drawing
upon the same data used in previous studies claiming that regime type,
culture, human capital, and civil-military relations have significant
effects on military performance.60 The goal is to provide a meaningful
contribution to our understanding of military effectiveness while
making the smallest possible changes to the research designs of the
latest studies. This technique helps prevent bias in favor of my
hypotheses and enables the reader to trace specific changes in
substantive conclusions to particular methodological alterations.61
Therefore, except for robustness checks and to create variables for
economic development, defense spending, and regime consolidation
variables, all of the data used in this study comes from Biddle and Long
(2004), which is the latest quantitative study on the determinants of
military effectiveness.

Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 63
The Biddle and Long data is a modified version of the CBD90
dataset, which was compiled for the US Army by the Historical
Evaluation and Research Organization, now called the Dupuy Institute.
Biddle and Long's modified version covers 381 battles fought since
1900. Each observation represents a battle, with attacker and defender
attributes as variables. The original data set contained significant
errors.62 But Biddle and Long improved the quality of the data by
removing double counts of battles and fixing historical inaccuracies.63
Dependent Variable
Loss-exchange ratio (LER): the LER is simply the attacker's casualties
divided by defender's casualties and has been used as a measure of
military effectiveness in Biddle and Long (2004) and Biddle (2004).
This measure can be calculated for individual battles or entire wars.
LERs have several benefits. First, it provides an objectively measurable,
continuous variable that is not dependent on subjective, post-hoc
codings like `win/lose/draw'. Second, LERs permit the magnitude of the
victory or defeat to be recorded and thus retain more of the actual
variance in the data. Third, LERs naturally control for the scale of
combat action, which is important because many military outcome
measures vary with the size of the units involved. Fourth, LERs have
been found to coincide significantly with more qualitative assessments
of effectiveness64 ­ the militaries considered by historians to have been
the most formidable have also tended to achieve the most favorable
LERs in battle. It should be noted that smaller LERs coincide with
greater military effectiveness for the attacker. Thus, in the empirical
analyses that follow, negative coefficients represent positive effects on
military effectiveness.
Independent Variables
Democracy: The attacker's fraction of the total democracy score for
combatants, measured by the respective Polity III `DEMOC' variable
values in the year prior to the outbreak of war. The higher the value,
the more democratic was the attacker relative to the defender and vice
versa.

Culture: A series of dummy variables representing combatant states'
primary religious affiliations as rough cultural indicators are employed.
`PC' denotes a state in which the most common religious affiliation is
Protestant or Catholic; `BU' Buddhist, Confucian, Shintoist, or a
combination thereof; `MU' Muslim; `JE' Jewish; and `OR' Orthodox
(Eastern Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, etc.). Each dummy represents a

Hypothesis 1: Economic Development Increases Military Effectiveness
Figure 1 shows that as the attacker's per-capita GDP increases relative
to the defender's, the number of defenders killed per attacker killed also
increases. Bivariate regressions show that these relationships are
significant at the 1 per cent level. In short, economically developed
states significantly outperform less developed states in battle.
To validate this finding, I employed four robustness checks. First, all
cases were dropped in which the economic development variable was
more than one standard deviation above or below its mean average.
Dropping these extreme cases, however, does not alter the initial
results. Thus, even relatively small differences in economic develop-
ment produce disparities in military effectiveness.
Second, to control for momentum or spillover effects between
battles, a smaller sample was created, containing only one battle per
dyad per month. This helps ensure that each observation is independent

66 Michael Beckley
of others. Once again, however, this modification does not alter the
results.
Third, two alternative measures were used for economic develop-
ment: energy consumption per capita and iron and steel production per
capita.69 As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, these alternative measures
do not change the basic pattern: economic development increases
effectiveness.
Finally, the relationship between development and effectiveness is
tested using the Correlates of War Inter-State War dataset. This
alternative source of data introduces a more diverse array of cases and a
different unit of analysis ­ wars as opposed to battles ­ thereby ensuring
that the previous findings were not the result of idiosyncracies of the
CDB90 dataset. Calculating loss-exchange ratios in coalition wars,
however, is problematic since it is not clear which country inflicted
particular sets of casualties. Therefore, I exclude all coalition wars and
consider only the bilateral wars for which per capita income data was
available. While this exclusion reduces the number of cases, it should
not bias the results. Moreover, some of the major coalition wars (e.g.
both World Wars and the four Arab­Israeli wars) are overrepresented
Figure 2. Energy consumption per capita as a predictor of loss-exchange ratios in

69Data for these variables was obtained from the National Material Capabilities

in the CDB90 dataset. Thus, dropping them helps check against the
possibility that the previous results were unique to these wars. Figure 4
shows that the relationship between economic development and
military effectiveness remains quite distinct, even when a different
dataset is used.

In sum, there is considerable support for the first hypothesis. The
positive relationship between economic development and military
effectiveness holds across two different datasets, three different
operationalizations of economic development, after extreme values of
the independent variable have been dropped from the analysis, and
after controlling for temporal dependence.
Hypothesis 2: Economic Development is the Primary Determinant of
Effectiveness
Table 1 presents multivariate results suggesting that the primary
determinant of military effectiveness is economic development, and
that many of the political and social factors posited to affect military
capability either seem to be irrelevant or have the opposite effect of that
found in previous studies. Two regressions are presented. Model 1
replicates the findings of Biddle and Long (2004), which shows that
human capital, culture, democracy, and civil-military relations sig-
nificantly affect loss-exchange ratios.

Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 69
Model 2 simply adds a variable for economic development (per capita
income). The first thing to notice is that the economic development
variable is highly significant (at the 1 per cent level), suggesting that the
positive relationship between development and effectiveness holds even
when controlling for materiel (number of troops, aircraft, artillery,
tanks) and a host of political and social factors.
Second, human capital becomes insignificant once per-capita GDP is
added to the regression. This suggests that primary and secondary
education exerts no meaningful, independent influence on military
effectiveness once development is taken into account. It is unlikely that
this result is caused by multicollinearity because the correlation
between per-capita GDP and human capital is only .38.
Similarly, the variables suggesting that Western culture improves
military effectiveness (Protestant/Catholic vs. Buddhist (PCBU) and
Jewish vs. Muslim (JEMU)) also become insignificant once economic
development is taken into account. In particular, the fact that the
JEMU variable loses its significance suggests that the military
dominance of Israel over its Arab enemies, attributed by some scholars
to Arab cultural deficiencies, is more likely a consequence of Israel's
superior level of economic development. Strangely, the Orthodox vs.
Muslim (ORMU) variable becomes significant once economic devel-
opment is accounted for. This might suggest that Eastern or Russian
Orthodox cultures have some military advantage over Muslim cultures.
It should be kept in mind, however, that this result is tentative, because
it is based on a limited number of observations, namely a handful of
battles against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. It should be noted
that a recent case study on the subject concludes that economic
underdevelopment, `more than anything else . . . holds the key to
understanding the capacity and performance of the Ottoman military
during World War I'.70 Moreover, if Orthodox culture systematically
enhances effectiveness, or if Muslim culture systematically undermines
it, then we might expect some of the other dummy variables that
include them (e.g. JEMU or PCOR) to be significant. In sum, Biddle and
Long's findings about culture do not hold once economic development
is taken into account, and the only finding that supports cultural
explanations of military effectiveness is sketchy.
Third, Model 2 corroborates Biddle and Long's finding that
democracy has a highly significant negative effect on military
effectiveness. This contradicts Reiter and Stam's studies and suggests
that their finding of a positive relationship between democracy and

battlefield effectiveness is actually attributable to other factors that
correlate positively with democracy. Thus, it seems that democracies
perform better on the battlefield in spite of their democratic political
institutions, not because of them.
The correlation between democracy and per capita GDP is quite high
(.68) but the reversal of the sign on democracy occurred when human
capital was added to the regression in Biddle and Long's original
model, and the correlation between those two variables is only .35.
More importantly, if there were a multicollinearity problem between
per capita GDP and democracy, one of those two variables would
become insignificant because its effect would be absorbed by the other
variable. Finally, an examination of the variance inflation factors does
not indicate a potential multicollinearity problem.71
Fourth, both civil-military relations variables are significant,
indicating that coups hurt military effectiveness. This result suggests
that political stability is an important determinant of effectiveness, but
the incidence of coups does not necessarily reflect the state of civil-
military relations within a country. In fact, it is often the absence of a
coup that indicates that leaders have solidified their own authority by
purposefully undermining the military's power and organization. Arab
states, for example, rarely experience coups despite having extremely
hostile civil-military relations.72 In short, political stability and
amicable civil-military relations do not necessarily go hand-in-hand,
so the Biddle and Long civil-military relations variable cannot be used
to confirm or deny the civil-military relations hypothesis. This will have
to be a subject for future research.
It is possible, however, to test further the possibility that political
stability independently affects military performance. To do so, I
conducted additional tests (not shown) using an alternative operatio-
nalization of political stability: the level of regime consolidation.
Literature on political change and civil wars has shown that highly
autocratic and highly democratic states are less prone to internal
conflict and violent regime changes than `intermediate' regimes in
which neither democracy nor autocracy has been fully consolidated.73
71The highest variance inflation factor (VIF) value is 8.98 (for the per capita income
variable), but only values greater than 10 suggest a multicollinearity problem. On this
point, see, John Neter, William Wasserman, and Michael H. Kutner, Applied Linear
Regression Models: Regression, Analysis of Variance, and Experimental Designs, 3rd
ed. (Homewood, IL: Irwin 1990), 408­11.

War, 1816­1992', American Political Science Review 95/1 (March 2001), 33­48.
Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 71
This paper follows these studies in using Polity data as a proxy for
political consolidation. The Polity IV data classifies political regimes
using a 21-point scale ranging from -10 (most autocratic) to þ10 (most
democratic). For each battle the absolute value of each side's Polity
score (for the year before the battle) is taken and a variable is created
for the attacker's fraction of the total Polity score of both sides. In a
simple bivariate regression (not shown here), more politically
consolidated sides achieve more favorable loss-exchange ratios,
suggesting that political stability increases effectiveness. This positive
effect, however, disappears once economic development is added to the
regression. It is unlikely that this change is the result of multi-
collinearity because the correlation between per capita income and
regime consolidation is only .44.
In sum, there is mixed support for the second hypothesis.74 Economic
development significantly improves military effectiveness even when a
host of other factors are taken into account. The results also suggest,
however, that the incidence of coups has a significant effect on
subsequent performance in battles, and democratic political institutions
degrade effectiveness. Economic development, therefore, is not all that
matters, but it is certainly one of the essential determinants of military
effectiveness.
Hypothesis 3: Economic Development Matters Independent of Defense
Spending
Table 2 presents multivariate results suggesting that economic
development positively affects military capability even when levels of
defense spending are taken into account. Model 1 shows that economic
development and defense spending both significantly enhance military
effectiveness. In other words, a state with a high level of defense
spending but a low level of economic development will not be as
militarily effective as a state with the same level of military spending
74The same robustness checks were employed as for hypothesis 1 (except for using the
Correlates of War data). Dropping extreme cases and controlling for momentum did
not alter the results. The alternate codings for economic development (iron/steel
production and energy consumption) are significant in regressions without the culture
dummy variables. Once the culture dummies are added, however, both of these proxies
for economic development become insignificant while the PCBU and JEMU culture
variables are statistically significant. There was also an attempt to control for pairwise
fixed effects by adding dummy variables for every dyad in the dataset. However, this
increased the number of independent variables to 64. Since there are only a few
hundred observations in the data set, there were simply not enough degrees of freedom
to produce any significant results.
72 Michael Beckley
but a higher level of economic development. This conclusion is further
substantiated by Model 2, which adds the full set of independent
variables. Economic development retains a highly significant positive
effect on military performance, but defense spending becomes
insignificant once other factors are taken into account. While past
studies have used defense spending per soldier as a proxy for the quality
of military forces, these results suggest that the level of economic
development is a much more accurate predictor.
Conclusion
The most influential ideas about military power heretofore have
centered either on material assets or political and social pathologies.
The first view, however, ignores military effectiveness, while the second
view mischaracterizes its determinants. Military effectiveness is a
crucial component of military power, but it is primarily a function of

Economic Development and Military Effectiveness 73
economic development, not of political and social factors. In particular,
economically developed states are more capable of generating highly
skilled military units and producing, maintaining, and modernizing
sophisticated military equipment. Part of this advantage stems from a
greater surplus of wealth, which allows developed states to sustain
large military investments without undermining long-term economic
growth. But economically developed states also derive military benefits
from their technological infrastructures, efficient production capacities,
advanced data analysis networks, stocks of managerial expertise, and
stable political environments. In short, military effectiveness cannot be
bought; it must be developed.
This positive relationship between development and effectiveness
holds across hundreds of battles, dozens of wars, and several different
operationalizations of development itself. Moreover, the connection
between economic development and fighting power remains robust
even when a host of other characteristics are taken into account. By
contrast, many political and social factors seem to have, at best,
marginal or idiosyncratic effects, suggesting that some of the
correlations found between these variables and military effectiveness
may not be causal. Instead, certain political and social pathologies may
be produced by, or correlate with, economic development. While some
of these factors may influence the process of economic growth and
thereby indirectly shape effectiveness, the results presented here suggest
that few directly affect military capability. Thus, the conventional
military dominance of Western democracies is really just the conven-
tional military dominance of the most economically developed states.
For those interested in developing a sound and quantifiable
conception of military power, this conclusion simplifies things: a state's
absolute level of material resources measures the quantity of its military
assets, while its level of economic development provides a solid proxy
for the quality of those assets. Combining these two components ­
resources and effectiveness ­ produces an accurate indicator of military
power upon which broader theoretical and empirical claims can be
tested.
The measures used in most academic studies and defense analyses, by
contrast, mistakenly conflate size with power and thereby overstate the
capabilities of large but underdeveloped states. China, for example,
currently possesses the world's largest military and will have the biggest
economy within the next 30 to 40 years. But these achievements reflect
demographic rather than military preponderance. In fact, size increas-
ingly counts for little as advances in firepower, targeting, and
communications make it possible for compact but sophisticated
militaries to inflict unprecedented levels of destruction upon massed
forces. Taiwan, Australia, and Singapore, to take three examples, can
74 Michael Beckley
do far more against potential adversaries than they could 30 years ago.
Meanwhile, China and India ­ the two most populous countries on
earth ­ have eschewed their comparative advantage in mass
and reoriented their militaries to fight, what former Chinese President
Jiang Zemin called, `local wars under modern high technology
conditions'.75 In short, the balance between quantity and quality has
shifted decisively in favor of the latter.
Countries like China, India, and Brazil are often considered to be
simultaneously great powers and developing countries, but the
empirical record suggests this is oxymoronic, at least in a military
sense. Poor states simply cannot offset the military deficiencies inherent
in economic backwardness. The main issue for military assessments,
therefore, is not whether other countries raise their defense budgets or
increase their access to advanced technologies from abroad ­ though
these factors remain important ­ but whether they develop the
economic capacity to produce, maintain, and coordinate complex
military systems. Despite much talk in recent years of `peer
competitors' and `power transitions', the United States is in a class by
itself in these respects.
This conclusion, however, should not be cause for excessive
optimism. Other countries can `pose problems without catching up',
meaning they do not necessarily need to surpass the United States in
an absolute sense to radically alter the status quo regarding a specific
issue or within a particular region.76 Since slight changes in
capabilities can have large geopolitical effects, it is absolutely essential
to understand how military effectiveness ebbs and flows over time.
Much of the existing literature on this subject assumes that a
country's military effectiveness is rooted in its culture and institutions.
This article, by contrast, suggests that the cultural and institutional
barriers to effectiveness dissipate as states become more economically
developed. Thus, the current surge in global prosperity, though
miraculous and wonderful in many ways, will also bring about
considerable military modernization. The American lead in conven-
tional military capabilities is larger than typically assumed, but it may
recede at a faster rate.
Managing the geopolitical consequences of economic development
has always been a fundamental task of statecraft, but the unprece-
dented pace and scope of growth today makes this both more difficult
and more important than ever before. Many factors will determine

whether such change occurs without violence, but one crucial
ingredient is clarity about the distribution of military power. As
historian Geoffrey Blainey concluded: `Wars usually begin when two
nations disagree on their relative strength.' Thus an explicit military
pecking order promotes peace. The most important point to be made,
therefore, is that the determinants of military power need to receive the
same kind of sustained and rigorous study that has been given to its
effects. Military power plays a pivotal role in shaping numerous aspects
of international relations, yet few analysts have taken the time to
develop a sound conception of this crucial variable or to understand
how it is created. Since so many policy decisions and academic theories
rely on assessments of military capability, it is absolutely imperative
that we get those assessments right.
