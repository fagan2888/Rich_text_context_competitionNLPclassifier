Abstract
Background and aims: Transient cognitive impairment (TCI) on the Mini Mental State Evaluation score is common
after transient ischemic attack/minor stroke and might identify patients at increased risk of dementia. We aimed to
replicate TCI using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), compare it with persistent Mild Cognitive Impairment
(PMCI), and to determine whether global cerebral hemodynamic changes could explain transient impairment.
Methods: Consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack/minor stroke (NIHSS 3) were assessed with the MoCA
and transcranial Doppler ultrasound acutely and at 1 month. We compared patients with TCI (baseline MoCA < 26
with ! 2 points increase at 1 month), PMCI (MoCA < 26 with < 2 points increase), and no cognitive impairment (NCI;
MoCA ! 26).
Results: Of 326 patients, 46 (14.1%) had PMCI, 98 (30.1%) TCI, and 182 (55.8%) NCI. At baseline, TCI patients had
higher systolic blood pressure (150.95 Æ 21.52 vs 144.86 Æ 22.44 mmHg, p ¼ 0.02) and lower cerebral blood flow
velocities, particularly end-diastolic velocity (30.16 Æ 9.63 vs 35.02 Æ 9.01 cm/s, p < 0.001) and mean flow velocity
(48.95 Æ 12.72 vs 54 Æ 12.46 cm/s, p ¼ 0.001) than those with NCI, but similar clinical and hemodynamic profiles to
those with PMCI. Systolic BP fell between baseline and 1 month (mean reduction ¼ 14.01 Æ 21.26 mmHg) and end-
diastolic velocity and mean flow velocity increased (mean increase ¼ þ 2.42 Æ 6.41 and 1.89 Æ 8.77 cm/s, respectively),
but these changes did not differ between patients with TCI, PMCI, and NCI.
Conclusions: TCI is detectable with the MoCA after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke and has similar clinical
and hemodynamic profile to PMCI. However, TCI does not appear to be due to exaggerated acute reversible global
hemodynamic changes.

Introduction
Risk of dementia is increased on follow-up after tran-
sient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke.1 Identifying
early markers of increased risk of cognitive decline
and dementia has the potential to inform the develop-
ment of disease-modifying therapies and has clinical
implications for counseling, long-term care planning,
driving, and legal and financial issues.2 Mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) precedes dementia in up to 80% of
cases,3 and predictors of risk of conversion to dementia
in MCI have been identified,4 including cerebrospinal
fluid biomarkers,5 MRI hippocampal volumetry,6 and
cerebral blood flow (CBF).7 However, more data are
required on simple clinical predictors. For example,
transient cognitive impairment (TCI) after TIA or
minor stroke, first described using the Mini Mental

State Evaluation (MMSE), might predict an increased
risk of subsequent dementia on follow-up.8
TCI might therefore identify a subgroup of patients
with exhausted cognitive reserve, but several issues
remain to be resolved. First, TCI should be detectable
using cognitive tests other than the MMSE. Compared
with the MMSE, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
test (MoCA) has proved to be more sensitive and spe-
cific as a screening test for MCI,9 particularly after cere-
brovascular events, and it incorporates executive and
attentional tasks suitable for vascular cognitive impair-
ment.10 We therefore aimed to determine the rate of TCI
after TIA and stroke using the MoCA. Second, the cause
of TCI is unknown, but could be related to transient
global flow disturbances due to changes in blood pres-
sure, endothelial function, or platelet activation in the
acute phase after TIA or minor stroke. Cerebral hypo-
perfusion has been reported in the early stages of cogni-
tive decline, using single-photon emission CT (SPECT)11
and carotid ultrasound,12 and transcranial Doppler
(TCD) studies have documented reduced blood flow
velocities (BFV) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
in both dementia13 and MCI.14
We therefore hypothesized that TCI and MCI might
have similar clinical and hemodynamic phenotypes and
that TCI might be due to exaggerated but reversible
global hemodynamic changes in the acute phase of
TIAs and minor strokes.
Methods
Participants
This study was nested in the Oxford Vascular
(OXVASC) Study, an ongoing population-based
study of the incidence and outcome of all acute vascular
events in a population of 92,728 individuals registered
with 100 primary care physicians in nine practices in
Oxfordshire, UK. Multiple methods of ascertainment
are used for patients with TIA or stroke, as detailed
elsewhere.15 These include a daily, rapid-access TIA/
stroke clinic, to which participating physicians and
the local emergency department refer all individuals
with suspected TIA or minor stroke.16
Consecutive eligible patients attending the OXVASC
rapid-access TIA/stroke clinic between November 2011
and April 2015 were enrolled in the present study.
Patients with presumed TIA or minor stroke
(NIHSS 3) were eligible if they were able to undergo
cognitive assessment; had no pre-existing clinical diag-
nosis of dementia in the primary care records; had no
disabling neurological deficit due to previous events;
were willing and able to come back to clinic for a 1-
month follow-up assessment; and had a temporal bone
window suitable for ultrasound insonation.
Procedures
Patients enrolled in the study were evaluated at two
time-points, acutely, in the rapid-access TIA/stroke
clinic, and at the 1-month follow-up visit. Patients
were assessed by a neurologist or stroke physician
and all presentations and investigations were reviewed
by the senior study neurologist. During the acute clin-
ical assessment, brain and vascular imaging were
obtained, either 3T MRI with time-of-flight MRA of
the intracranial vessels and a contrast enhanced MRA
of the large neck arteries or brain CT with contrast
enhanced CTA/Duplex ultrasound if MRI was
contraindicated.
The MoCA was administered at initial assessment
and was repeated at 1-month follow-up along with
the MMSE. At both time points, TCD sonography
(Doppler Box, Compumedics DWL, Singen,
Germany) was performed by one of three experienced
operators, who were unaware of the patient's clinical
presentation and results of cognitive assessment. MCA
BFV was recorded with a handheld 2 MHz probe
through temporal bone window at the depth that pro-
vided the best signal. Each session was stored in the
hard disk of the TCD device for subsequent off-line
analysis.
Secondary prevention treatment was started after
the initial assessment and included aspirin (300 mg
loading and then 75 mg daily), plus clopidogrel
(300 mg loading dose and then 75 mg for 30 days) for
high-risk patients; atorvastatin (40 mg daily); antihy-
pertensive treatment (unless systolic blood pressure
was below 130 mm Hg on repeated measurement),
according to a standardized protocol: a combination
of perindopril 5 mg and indapamide 1.25 mg followed
by addition of amlodipine 5/10 mg, if necessary.
The OXVASC study and TCD assessment were
approved by the local ethics committee and consent
was obtained from all participants.
Statistical analysis
To validate TCI using the MoCA, the mean change in
MoCA score between baseline and follow-up was cal-
culated on all recruited patients. MoCA scores were
also divided into the 10 standard cognitive domains,9
which included visuoexecutive, naming, digit spam,
attention, calculation, repetition, verbal fluency,
abstract reasoning, recall, and orientation. Changes in
each sub-score were calculated between baseline and
follow-up.
For analyses of TCD parameters, patients with sig-
nificant ICA or MCA stenosis (!50%)17 on vascular
imaging were excluded, as were patients who had recur-
rent stroke between baseline assessment and 1-month

follow-up. However, to avoid any selection bias,
patients recruited with what was considered initially
to be a TIA, but in whom an alternative diagnosis
was subsequently made on the basis of further
investigation and follow-up were included in the main
analysis, but sensitivity analyses excluding these cases
were also done.
For further analysis of TCD data, cognitive patterns
were classified as ``No cognitive impairment'' if MoCA
score at baseline assessment was ! 26. Patients with
MoCA score <26 were classified as either ``Persistent
mild cognitive impairment'' (PMCI) if their MoCA
score at 1 month did not increase by more than one
point, or ``TCI'' if their score increased by !2 points.
Demographic, clinical, cognitive, physiological charac-
teristics, and risk factors of patients in these three
groups were compared using 2 test or ANOVA as
appropriate. Degree of white matter changes (WMC)
in the three groups was compared using the age-related
WMC scale for both CT and MRI,18 rating five differ-
ent regions in both hemispheres according to a 0­3
score. Total score was categorized as absent (0), mild
(1­5), moderate (6­10), and severe (>10).
TCD measures of peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-
diastolic velocity (EDV), mean flow velocity (MFV),
and pulsatility index (PI) are given as a mean of the
average of two measurements on each side; systolic
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) are given as mean of two measurements taken
during the TCD procedure. Cerebrovascular resistance
index (CVRi ¼ mean blood pressure/MFV) was also
calculated, consistently.
Analyses were repeated after stratification of
the cohort in three age groups: <60, 60­70,
and > 70 years of age. All analyses were done in
SPSS version 22.
Results
Among all 355 eligible patients initially recruited
(Figure 1), there was a significant overall increase in
mean MoCA score between baseline and follow-up
(mean change ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 1.43­1.95, p < 0.001).
Mean/SD change was significant for the visuo-execu-
tive cognitive domain (þ0.21/1, p < 0.001), naming
(þ0.05/0.34, p ¼ 0.008), calculation (þ0.09/0.65,
p ¼ 0.007), repetition (þ0.11/0.72, p ¼ 0.004), verbal
fluency (þ0.07/0.52, p ¼ 0.008), abstract reasoning
(0.17/0.60, p < 0.001), recall (þ0.83/1.32, p < 0.001),
and orientation (þ0.13/0.63, p < 0.001) with non-signif-
icant increases in the digit span (þ0.01/0.49) and atten-
tion (þ0.02/0.31) domains.

Of this initially recruited group, 29 patients were
excluded from the analyses of TCD parameters,
mostly due either to identification of ! 50% ICA/
MCA stenosis or a recurrent stroke prior to the
1-month follow-up (Figure 1). Of the remaining 326
patients, 268 (82.2%) had a clinically definite TIA or
minor stroke and 58 (17.8%) had an eventual diagnosis
of possible TIA or an alternative, most commonly
migraine variant (N ¼ 22). Results of sensitivity ana-
lyses of only patients with definite TIA/stroke are
shown in Tables I and II of online supplement.
In the 326 eligible patients with repeat cognitive
assessment and TCD at 1 month, mean SBP fell between
baseline and 1-month (mean Á SBP ¼ À14.01,
SD ¼ 21.26 mmHg), whereas mean (SD) PSV, EDV,
and MFV increased (ÁPSV ¼ þ 2.47(13.57) cm/s;
ÁEDV ¼ þ 2.42 (6.41) cm/s; ÁMFV ¼ þ 1.89 (8.77)
cm/s). Consistently, mean (SD) CVRi decreased
byÀ0.29 (0.5).
Of these 326 patients, 46 (14.1%) had PMCI, 98
(30.1%) had TCI, and 182 (55.8%) had NCI
(Table 1). Subtype of ischemic stroke for each group
according to TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute
Stroke Treatment) are shown in Table IV of the sup-
plement. Among patients who underwent MRI at base-
line (269 out of 326, 82.5%), the frequency of DWI
positive lesions did not differ between these groups
(Table 1). Similarly, although time from the onset of
the TIA or stroke to seeking medical attention varied
(224 patients were seen within 7 days and 102 were seen
after 7 days), cognitive group was unrelated to delay
(Table 1). However, prevalence of TCI increased with
age: 19% in the < 60 age group, 28% between 60 and
70, and 39% over 70 (p < 0.001).

When compared with NCI, TCI patients were older
(p < 0.001), had higher pre-morbid mRS (p ¼ 0.035),
were more likely to be diabetic (p ¼ 0.028), and to
have a low education (p < 0.001) (Table 1). The TCI
group showed higher mean SBP and lower MCA
BFVs (Table 2) at baseline assessment, mainly with
lower MFV, EDV, and higher PI and CVRi. These dif-
ferences were also present at 1-month follow-up (Table
2) and were most marked in patients aged ! 60 years
(Table III of online supplement). However, the changes
in SBP, DBP, EDV, MFV, and CVRi between baseline
and FU were similar in the two groups (Table 2).
In contrast, patients with TCI did not differ from
patients with PMCI in age (p ¼ 0.19), pre-morbid disabil-
ity (p ¼ 0.61), low education (p ¼ 0.43), or other risk fac-
tors (Table 1). Patients with TCI and PMCI also had
similar physiological profiles in terms of BP and TCD
parameters at baseline (Table 3). By definition, cognitive
function was improved at 1 month in the TCI group
(mean/SD ÁMoCA ¼ 3.93/1.78), particularly in recall
(Á ¼ 1.50/1.35), visuospatial domain (Á ¼ 0.70/1.16)
and abstraction (Á ¼ 0.42/0.69), but changes in BP
and TCD parameters did not differ from those in
patients with PMCI and NCI (Tables 2 and 3). These
findings did not change after excluding 36 (37%)
patients with TCI in whom the MoCA at 1-month
was improved but nevertheless remained < 26 (data
not shown).
Discussion
This is the largest study, to our knowledge, of longitu-
dinal changes of cognitive performance soon after a
TIA/minor stroke. We showed an overall improvement
in cognition between baseline assessment and 1-month
follow-up, confirming that reversible cognitive impair-
ment can be demonstrated after minor cerebral ische-
mic events using the MoCA, which is more sensitive
and specific than MMSE as a screening test for MCI9
and for vascular cognitive impairment.10 We have also
shown that patients with TCI have similar clinical and
global hemodynamic characteristics to those with
persisting MCI, but we were not able to explain reso-
lution of TCI on the basis of improved MCA BFVs at
1-month follow-up.
Patients with TCI would, by definition, have been
classified as cognitively impaired when first seen in
the emergency clinic, scoring less than 26 on the
MoCA. However, 63% of such patients scored ! 26 at
the 1-month follow-up visit. Improvement was seen
mainly in recall, as previously demonstrated with the
MMSE,8 but also in the visuospatial and abstraction
domain, confirming previous results with the MoCA,19
which is more sensitive to visuo-executive and atten-
tional domains.10 These findings support the advice
given in some countries that temporary abstaining
from driving, and perhaps from other cognitively com-
plex tasks, is advisable after a TIA/minor stroke.
Notwithstanding the improvement in the cognitive
performance, TCI patients displayed a functional pro-
file, risk factors, and MCA hemodynamic indices simi-
lar to PMCI patients, and this applied also when
restricting the analysis only to the 63% of TCI patients
with ! 26 MoCA score at 1 month. That is, patients
with TCI who would have been classified as cognitively
unimpaired at the 1-month follow-up visit had MCA
perfusion indices similar to patients with persistent cog-
nitive impairment. Previous data from the OXVASC
study showed that TCI patients were more prone to
develop cognitive decline and overt dementia on long-
term follow-up,8 and further follow-up of the current
cohort will confirm whether lower MCA BFVs predict
cognitive decline.14
TCI could be an early manifestation of MCI in
patients who are still usually performing within a
normal cognitive range, but who have very limited cog-
nitive reserve. Preclinical stages of dementia are asso-
ciated to lower MCA MFVs,13,14 and higher PI could
predict progression from MCI to overt dementia.20
However, we could not find any relation between the
transient cognitive deterioration and changes in global
cerebral hemodynamic variables. SBP and DBP
decreased equally across our three cognitive groups
between baseline and follow-up, probably as a result
of antihypertensive treatment (Tables 2 and 3), with
similar increases in cerebral BFVs.21 Moreover, as the
frequency of TCI did not decrease with time since TIA
or stroke, it is unlikely that an acute decrease in cere-
bral perfusion secondary to the cerebral vascular event
could be the cause of transient of cognitive
perturbation.
Consistent with previous reports,8,18 TCI patients
were older than patients with no cognitive impairment.
However, TCI patients were in the same age range as
patients with PMCI. Cognition, BP, and cerebral flow
velocities are all strongly related to age.22 When our
patients were stratified by age, the proportion with
TCI increased with age, and the differences in global
hemodynamic features between patients with TCI and
NCI became more evident (Table III of online supple-
ment). Moreover, the differences were most evident in
MCA EDV and MFV, which best reflect vascular
resistance in cerebral circulation.23
Our study has some limitations. First, the definition of
TCI as a two or more point improvement in MoCA score
has not yet been widely standardized. However, it was
based on previous evidence that changes in MoCA
scores between evaluations 1 month apart averaged 0.9
points,9 and is also consistent with the only previous study
on MoCA changes soon after TIA/minor stroke.18

Second, we do not yet have long-term follow-up to
confirm our previous observation that TCI patients are
more prone to develop permanent cognitive impairment.8
Third, we did not do any test of anxiety or depression at
baseline or 1-month follow-up. TCI could, at least partly,
be a non-specific transient perturbation in cognition in
patients with exhausted cognitive reserve related to anx-
iety rather than being specifically caused by the cerebro-
vascular event, particularly in the acute assessment in a
hospital setting with multiple unfamiliar investigations. A
role for anxiety might also explain why the frequency of
TCI was independent of the time interval between symp-
tom-onset and baseline assessment. Fourth, TCD, mea-
suring BFV, does not provide absolute quantification of
CBF. However, MCA BFV indices are strongly related to
cerebral peripheral resistance, in particular EDV, which
reliably reflects changes in perfusion,23 PI, which is also a
marker of small vessel disease,24 and CVRi, which reflects
the relationship between blood pressure and CBF.25
Fifth, our hypothesis was that TCI could be caused
by transient global flow disturbances in the acute phase
of TIAs and minor strokes, but we couldn't find any
global hemodynamic change specifically associated to
TCI. However, our TCD study cannot exclude focal
hemodynamic abnormalities. Further studies with
high sensitivity MRI could address this issue looking
at focal perfusion abnormalities. Last, we have not
investigated vascular territories other than the MCA
like posterior circulation. Therefore, we cannot exclude
that hemodynamic changes in other territories are
related to cognitive changes in the TCI group.
Conclusions
In conclusion, TCI is detectable with the MoCA after
TIA and minor stroke and affected patients have similar
clinical and hemodynamic profiles to those with PMCI.
However, we were not able to demonstrate any exagger-
ated acute reversible changes in global hemodynamic
indices in the TCI group that might have explained the
transient cognitive dysfunction. Nevertheless, it is
important that clinicians are aware of the possibility of
TCI in patients with TIA and minor stroke, particularly
in relation to the recall of advice given in the acute phase
and the capacity to perform complex tasks.
