This review of social work's contribution to the literature on
intercountry adoption (ICA) was originally developed for the
2010 Ontario Adoption Summit, which brought together a
multidisciplinary group of scholars, practitioners, and other
stakeholders to focus on the future of ICA, including the
"need to reduce corruption and human trafficking while
maximizing the best interests of children who are abandoned
or relinquished" (Adoption Summit, n.d.). Each discipline
presented on the current state of knowledge, and this litera-
ture review was conducted for the social work panel. To give
some structure to this literature review, we defer to Masson's
(2001) exploration of ICA and her questioning the practice
as a "global problem or global solution?" Masson identifies
typologies of value-positions or perspectives on ICA: aboli-
tionists, pragmatists, and promoters.
Applying these perspectives, Rotabi and Gibbons (2009)
find that there is diversity across the disciplines actively
involved in researching ICAwith the majority voicing a prag-
matic view (Gibbons & Rotabi, in press). Historian Dubinsky
(2010), on examination of adoption ethics and the history of
adoption from and within theAmericas, asserts, "Professional
concerns about adoption practice are voiced in relative obscu-
rity of social work journals" (p. 100). We collate social work
contributions on the subject of ICA and reform, indicating a
small but strong body of work providing critical discourse
about the "concerns" and recommendations for change. We
begin with exploration of the concept of the best interests of
the child as well as the usage of the term orphan across the
broad and multidisciplinary literature to provide a context
and illustrate the challenges. Then, we review ICA themes
in social work literature.
Beginning With an Important
Concept: The Best Interests
of the Child Defined
The best interest of the child is one of the four principles of
the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and,
more specifically, is mentioned in Article 21 of the CRC as
the paramount consideration when considering ICA (United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989; Vité &
Boéchat, 2008). It is also mentioned in Articles 1, 4, and 16
of the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children
and the Cooperation in Relation to Intercountry Adoption
(henceforth referred to as the Hague Convention or simply
the HCIA; The Hague Conference on Private International
Law, 1993). Therefore, it is an overarching principle in ICA
policy and practice. However, as important as this principle

In an Era of Reform:A Review of Social
Work Literature on Intercountry Adoption
Karen Smith Rotabi1 and Kelley McCreery Bunkers2
Abstract
Intercountry adoption (ICA) is a relatively common practice. Since its contemporary conception during the Second World
War, approximately one million children have been adopted internationally. Controversy surrounding ICA includes ideas
about human rights and notions of child rescue in the context of major reform to prevent child sales and abduction under
the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. Social work, as a discipline, is a central player in ICA practices, and at least,
one historian asserts that social work academic literature is scant on the topic of problematic practice and reforms.A review
of the social work literature was conducted, and four thematic areas emerged in the 87 manuscripts reviewed: (a) social
policy; (b) exploitation, social justice, ethics, and human rights; (c) clinical perspectives to include identity, child development,
and family transition; and (d) child welfare practices. Results indicate a small but robust body of social work literature, and
highlights are presented as well as analysis indicating methodical trends.

is to ICA, interpretation is the problem, as understanding
and implementation of this principle are greatly influenced
by cultural and contextual factors (Alston, 1994).
The inherent challenges related to defining the best inter-
ests of the child principle have been explored by academics
of all related professional disciplines. Human rights' expert
Phillip Alston (1994) underscores how the principle acts as a
bridge or a mediator between cultural beliefs and children's
rights. Legal scholars especially have called on the best
interest of the child principle to support and challenge ICA
as an intervention (Bartholet & Smolin, in press; Dillon,
2009; McKinney, 2007; Oreskovic & Maskew, 2009). Social
work researchers have asserted that protecting the best inter-
ests of children within the ICA must be based on a systems
approach to ensure universally implemented ethical and
legal child welfare practices (Hollingsworth, 2003, 2008;
Howe, 2010; Roby, 2007; Rotabi, 2008; Selinske, Naughton,
Flanagan, & Pickles, 2001; Triseliotis, 2000). Currently, we
lack a formalized definition of the best interests principle as
it relates to ICA--one that is empirically tested and agreed
on universally--and it is necessary to truly ensure that safe-
guards for children and families are in place.
Given that the CRC and the Hague Convention fail to pro-
vide precise requirements on what must be considered when
determining the best interest of the child in ICA, social work
professionals can look toward common values shared by
social work, the CRC, and the Hague Convention, including
ensuring that domestic care options are explored prior to
placement in ICA, preserving information about the child's
history and family of origin, soliciting and taking into account
the views of the child, and providing professional services by
people who place the child's well-being at the center of all
decisions (The Hague Conference on Private International
Law, 2008; Wayne, 2006). Attending to all the facets of a
balanced determination of a child's best interests must be tai-
lored to each child and his or her unique family system's
strengths and needs, including empirical evidence when
making social service recommendations and selecting inter-
ventions. Zermatten, a leading child rights scholar and the
recently elected chairperson of the U.N. CRC, acknowledges
the need for more empirical evidence to help better inform
decision makers about the best interest principle (Zermatten,
2010). This is, in part, due to the misunderstanding of which
children are truly orphaned and which children have intact
family and kinship systems in need of support rather than
ICA as an intervention.
Defining "Orphan"
One of the troubling trends in the general literature and the
practice community is the use, misuse, and even occasional
abuse of the term orphan. Recognizing the dangers and
potential pitfalls of this term is important if social work as a
profession aims to improve ICA services. The term orphan
has returned to common lexicon in the past decade with the
onset of HIV and AIDS and is especially prevalent in the
African context (Roby & Shaw, 2006), as it has become a
major priority for international aid agencies (Ennew, 2005).
Abebe (2009) points out, in the midst of this prioritization,
that the term orphan has become extremely politicized, espe-
cially by the donor community and mass media, with orphan
being defined by different parties and for different reasons,
some of those not always in the best interests of children
(Abebe, 2009).
Similar to the best interest of the child principle, the con-
cept of orphan is not necessarily understood by all cultures or
by all professions the same way. Orphanhood may be defined
by death of one or both birth parents, by age of the child, and
even by the reasons for parental death, as is the case of AIDS.
There are "double orphans" who have lost both parents to
death or some other permanent separation, and there are "sin-
gle orphans" (Abebe, 2009). This latter group would be called
children of single parents in industrialized nations; however,
in low-resource countries, they are often counted as orphans,
illustrating differences of word usages across cultures and
economic contexts.
Defining the child as an orphan is frequently done by peo-
ple who have a vested interest in the final outcome. For exam-
ple, by referring to the UNICEF statistic of 143 million
orphans globally, proponents of ICA may use this statistic to
promote their ICA position or perspective (e.g., Bartholet,
2010; Dillon, 2009), in spite of the fact that this inflated num-
ber does not at all reflect the true and much smaller number of
children in need of and appropriate for ICA as a final place-
ment option (see Bartholet & Smolin, in press; UNAIDS,
UNICEF, & USAID, 2004).
Social orphans are those children who may be living in an
institution--placed there by parents or close relatives--as a
placement option where proper nutrition and education are
consistently accessible and are living in a low-resource nation
(Roby & Maskew, in press). This was found to be true for
most of the children living in institutions in Haiti at the time
of the January 2010 earthquake (Balsari, Lemery, Williams,
& Nelson, 2010; Selman, in press). Brazil is another nation
with many social orphans living as street children in addition
to adolescents living in institutions. Of the latter, sometimes
institutions are used as a response to juvenile delinquency
(Garcia & Fernandez, 2009). These "orphans" have family
systems, some more intact than others, and supporting these
family resources in an effort to reunify families and deinstitu-
tionalize children is critically important. In these cases, ICA
is most likely not the appropriate solution.
Bailey (2009b) discusses the limited attention paid to the
issue of orphans in English social work literature. The scar-
city of information available leaves practitioners, policy
makers, and academics with a very limited view of the issues
facing children and social work practitioners outside the bor-
ders of high-resource countries (Bailey, 2009b). This limited
information allows for common misinterpretations. Ensuring
that a commonly understood and appropriate definition of
Rotabi and Bunkers 3
the term orphan is identified and agreed on by social work
professionals is an important step in promoting a better under-
standing of family group structure and the need for social
intervention.
Social Work as a Discipline:A
Largely PragmaticVoice Prevails
Generally speaking, when reviewing social work literature,
the majority voice is pragmatic, and this is logical given social
work's long-standing commitment to child welfare policy
and practice. Literature addressing the social work role is
given attention in this review, and because there is a limited
literature from social workers in low-resource nations, when-
ever possible, that literature is included. Also, literature from
underrepresented countries and regions is given additional
attention. While we emphasize peer-reviewed literature,
however, when appropriate, we occasionally include "gray
literature" because they are often written by social workers
and child rights advocates in child-sending nations (Banks,
2006; McAuley, Pham, Tugwell & Moher, 2000). These
reports are early literature indicating poor practice and adop-
tion fraud. When such reports begin to emerge, they are
often treated as rumor without enough "evidence" or
research rigor to publish in refereed journals, but later, they
are cited historically.
As Bailey (2009b) points out, social work literature in the
majority of academic journals has been dominated by the per-
spectives of North American and Western European scholars.
Knowledge about social work practice in low- or middle-
income countries or global practice in general is inadequate,
and it reminds us of repeated commentaries or even chal-
lenges for greater global understanding in the profession
(Healy & Link, 2011). Rodgers (2009) calls for social work to
tackle the challenge of human rights, ethics, and human
responsibilities, including exploration of praxis from multiple
perspectives. This is particularly relevant to ICA practice
given the transactional nature of child welfare extending
across geographic borders and the interface of social care sys-
tems--social workers and other disciplines like pediatricians
and psychologists collaborating on child placement between
low- and high-resource nations.
Identifying Social Work Literature
andThemes in ICA
To explore existing literature for this review, standard search
engines were used, including Academic Search Complete
and PsychINFO. Social work authors who have been par-
ticularly active in the field were given special consideration,
using Google Scholar Internet searches in addition to a
review of curriculum vitaés. Also, journals dedicated to
international social work, child welfare, and adoption (e.g.,
Adoption Quarterly) were searched specifically in addition
to using Social Work Abstracts for a discipline-specific
search. Literature reviewed spans from the late 1970s until
2010, with the exception of adding manuscripts identified as
"in press." Authors were confirmed to be social workers and
when there were multiple authors, it was confirmed that at
least one of the contributors was a social worker.
While this is a summary of highlights of social work lit-
erature with a theme of ICA reform or having implications
for human service improvement and/or reform, it is not abso-
lutely exhaustive. Summarized are the contributions of 87
manuscripts with 70 being peer reviewed. By and large, the
earliest social work reform literature dates back to the late
1970s and early 1980s, due to the Vietnam Babylift (Joe,
1978; A. S. Ryan, 1983) and cultural identity questions that
were being posed about Korean adoptees (e.g., Kim, 1977).
Then the early 1990s marked an era of rapid globalization,
which eventually emerges into what we call the era of
reform. Romanian adoptions were largely the focus in the
earliest stages of literature in the era of globalization with a
transition to other nations and application of global social
policy, practice, and value dilemmas in the era of reform
(e.g., Vonk, Simms, & Nackerud, 1999, on China).
The vast majority of publications had a common theme of
(a) social policy; (b) exploitation, social justice, ethics, and
human rights; (c) clinical perspectives to include identity,
child development, and family transition; and (d) child wel-
fare practices. Although all of these areas overlap, the litera-
ture review will be reported in this bounded order. We
emphasize literature that discusses the role of the social
worker in orphan and vulnerable child care and/or ICA prac-
tices. Also, literature that is particularly important conceptu-
ally and/or should be noted due to empirical rigor also
receives greater attention.
Social Policy
Social policy analysis and discussion are prominent in much
of the social work literature with examples and/or case stud-
ies that are often presented to underscore issues (e.g., Altstein
& Simon, 1991). For example, A. S. Ryan (1983), a social
work practitioner who was involved in early ICA work,
including the Vietnam Babylift, wrote about child rescue
efforts. As a promoter, Ryan states that "when increasing
numbers of children are confined to refugee camps . . . in
many cases intercountry adoption is their best hope for a
chance in life, and for life itself" (p. 49). Her discussion
concludes with 10 recommendations, including not only
government funding for research but also the need for an
"international coordinating agency which could set standards
for intercountry adoption" (p. 58) in addition to the need
for home study authority in the placement state as well as
the general development of good policy.
Ten years later, the 1993 Hague Convention was devel-
oped and set forth requirements for governance at a central
authority level, thereby meeting Ryan's (1983) suggestion
of a coordination approach. Today more than 80 nations are
4 SAGE Open
party to the agreement set forth to promote the best interests
of the child and prevent child sales, abduction, and child traf-
ficking while providing a framework for ethical adoption
and interstate cooperation (The Hague Conference on Private
International Law, 1993, 2008). This international agreement
has been discussed by Bailey (2009a), Freundlich (2000),
Hollingsworth (2003, 2008), Howe (2010), Roby (2007),
Rotabi (2008), Rotabi and Gibbons (in press), Triseliotis
(2000), and others as they consider issues of commodifica-
tion of children and social work concerns ranging from social
justice to policy and practice at the agency level. A watershed
moment for signature countries, the agreement requires that
nations meet international child welfare standards not just for
ICA as a single practice area but also to provide a range of
care and family support that should occur prior to any ratify-
ing nation's approval of a child for ICA. This continuum of
child welfare placement options is based on the subsidiarity
principle of the HCIA, which is that biological families
should first be supported before alternative care becomes a
plan for children. Then, if necessary, children have a right to be
placed within a family system (e.g., kinship care/guardianship)
and when possible, remain in their country of origin.
Once kinship and other appropriate local care approaches
are explored, including foster care and/or domestic adoption,
then the child or sibling group may be deemed appropriate
for consideration of placement into ICA (Rotabi, 2008).
Moreover, although social work scholars have long consid-
ered the best interests of children and the continuum of child
welfare intervention, including adoption, currently there is a
lack of empirical literature on the subject as it relates to ICA.
This is especially true in regards to the subsidiarity principle
of the HCIA and the care practices of orphaned and vulner-
able children (Abebe, 2009), specifically interventions that
honor subsidiarity rather than fast-tracking desirable children
into ICA (Rotabi & Gibbons, in press).
Bergquist's (2009, in press) policy analysis of the HCIA
focuses on its application to disaster and war. Reviewing the
history of the Vietnam Babylift and child abduction attempts
elsewhere, Bergquist makes important points about the
removal of children in the context of emergency and war,
including contemporary discourse on child "rescue." An
important consideration is child status either being "orphans"
or "refugees." Bergquist recognizes the HCIAas an important
step forward but ultimately concludes that it is inadequate in
the context of war and disaster.
This analytical thread of limited HCIAguidance is carried
on in the case of disaster by Rotabi and Bergquist (2010),
focusing on a U.S. based faith group's attempt to abduct chil-
dren for adoption in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in
Haiti. In this case, the crime and then the lack of will to ulti-
mately prosecute the individuals involved with attempted
child trafficking for adoption were explored. This reality
underscores, in real terms, the limited consequences for child
abduction for adoption. In the case of Haiti, the HCIAdid not
apply because Haiti was not a party to the agreement at
that time. As a result, the capacity to prosecute for human
trafficking was ultimately inadequate under legal codes (see
Bromfield & Rotabi, in press).
Rotabi and Bergquist (2010) explore the best interests of
the child, the differences of opinion, and the ethical dilem-
mas that arise when making broad generalizations about
orphans and extreme poverty, especially when ICA is pro-
moted as a dominant child welfare intervention. ICA in
Guatemala became the epicenter of this debate, and there has
been a small body of research on the postconflict context and
child welfare system of this particularly significant sending
nation from 1999 to 2008.
Bunkers, Groza, and Lauer (2009) and Bunkers and
Groza (in press) present a historical and policy analysis of
Guatemala's ICAtrends, illustrating how the practice became
a multimillion-dollar industry. These authors argue that
ICA and the financial pressures ultimately undermined the
Guatemalan State's interest in developing a domestic child
welfare system and rather relied on ICAas the main response.
This supplanted child welfare efforts across a continuum of
care ultimately yielding to ICA because of the powerful
financial influences at all levels of the system. Among
their observations were birth mother payments. The authors
asserted that this form of child sales became routine within
Guatemalan adoption practices. Gresham, Nackerud, and
Risler (2004) also considered this issue and captured the wor-
risome human rights violations that were documented by the
United Nations Economic and Social Council Commission
on Human Rights (2000). An important gray report devel-
oped by a large group of human rights defenders, lawyers,
and social workers titled "Adoptions in Guatemala: Protection
or Business?" (Alianza et al., 2007) identified a clear mar-
ket dynamic with at least 90% of the children departing
Guatemala being ages 0 to 2 years and mainly bound to the
United States. In an effort to assess the context and problems
of Guatemalan adoptions within an ecological perspective,
Rotabi, Morris, and Weil (2008) present postconflict social
indicators with observations about the role of social workers
engaged in a nation notorious for extreme violence against
women, including child abduction (Rotabi, 2009). These
authors also pose questions about the conception of "client"
and the professional role of social workers and others repre-
senting the interests of international adoption agencies--
frequently distorting the realities of orphaned and vulnerable
children to serve the private adoption model. Changes in the
Guatemalan system and radical decline in ICA (Bunkers &
Groza, in press; Rotabi & Bunkers, 2008) have resulted in
shifts to other nations, most notably Ethiopia (Selman, 2009).
Bunkers, Rotabi, and Mezmur (in press) focus on emerg-
ing concerns and problems in Ethiopia, including legal codes
and processes that undermine the best interests of the child.
This includes Ethiopia's failure to sign and accede to the
HCIA thus far, leaving the nation vulnerable to unscrupulous
entrepreneurs who are not bound by international standards--
it is feared that some of the most unethical adoption agencies
Rotabi and Bunkers 5
have shifted from Guatemala to Ethiopia as a new frontier.
Some of the troubling activities include adoptive-birth fam-
ily visits in villages and gift exchanges (Rotabi, 2010), inter-
secting with traditional child care models. This includes
Gudifecha, a centuries-old practice in which family and kin
arrange informal adoption for orphaned and vulnerable chil-
dren (Bunkers et al., in press).
Including Ethiopia as a significant country of origin,
Butterfield and Alemu (2006) as well as Roby and Shaw
(2006) explore some of the issues and opportunities of child
adoption in their analysis of the larger African region. In this
latter analysis, the authors bring the ICA discourse back to
local concerns for adoption of African American children
from the public child welfare system in the United States,
thereby highlighting some of the challenges and contradic-
tions of ICA. Finally, it should be noted that limited infor-
mation and analysis are also found in the gray literature
specifically addressing adoption trends and concerns in
the African continent as a whole (United Nations, 2009).
However, this is likely to change given the increasing focus
on and practice of adoption in this region.
Other countries have contributed significantly to ICA,
most notably China. British authors Dowling and Brown
(2009) discuss ICA changes in China in the context of global-
ization such as the shift toward special needs children, also
briefly discussing the nation's efforts toward domestic foster
care and adoption. From China itself, Meng and Kai (2009)
present a historical perspective, including differing defini-
tions of "orphan" and the one-child policy, children orphaned
by AIDS, and children socially orphaned due to parental
imprisonment. While noting a huge discrepancy between
China's official government estimates of 573,000 orphans
and UNICEF's estimates of 21 million children, authors inte-
grate economic realities, including a discussion of privileged
versus marginalized groups. These authors mention ICA
briefly as an intervention, but ultimately, their focal point is
different domestic care models, including orphanages, fos-
ter care, and kinship care. New and emerging roles of social
workers are discussed with the challenges related to the pro-
jected increase in children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.
African scholar Maundeni (2009) outlines the definition
of "orphans" and their care in Botswana, also considering
children orphaned by HIV/AIDS and challenges for social
workers. Poverty-reduction programs, social development
issues, and a brief discussion of the laws that govern the
practice of child care are presented. The subject of child
rights frames the discussion, including different forms of
assistance to children and their families without any men-
tion of ICA. The author observes that social workers are
overwhelmed partly because of inadequate training, specifi-
cally in child welfare, as well as their daily function of serv-
ing multiple villages in a community development approach.
The capacity to care for the needs of individual children or to
focus on family support of specific or at-risk families is lack-
ing in this mode of intervention. The importance of kinship
care in this traditional society is discussed, and Maundeni
points out that 95% of orphans are absorbed in such structures
within communities--without social service intervention.
Kinship care problems are outlined, such as the separation of
orphan siblings across the kin-group for economic reasons or
a lack of self-determination on the part of some children for
their own care planning. Formalized interventions include
fostering and adoption, and these forms of alternative care are
found in the Botswana 2008 legal code, but the state has not
yet implemented these programs. The family-care approach
to institutional care, with house parents, is used in small-scale
programs. The author points out that these homes are not like
stereotypical inhumane institutions, as this smaller scale
approach enables tailored care to address the unique needs of
children.
From the Australian perspective, Fronek (2006) offers a
theoretical framework for understanding the "emergence, dif-
fusion, and continuance of South Korean intercountry adop-
tion" (p. 22), which is largely based on policy and the global
context of both the sending country (South Korea) and receiv-
ing countries. Drawing on previous literature on the subject,
cited is Sarri, Baik, and Bombyk's (1998) important observa-
tion that South Korea has experienced goal displacement
because of the nation's failure to establish adequate adoption
services on a domestic level and deferring to ICA as the inter-
vention of choice for orphaned and vulnerable children.
However, Fronek points to inadequate domestic adoption
systems as only one factor in the ICA equation in the Asian
nation that has been a relatively active country of origin,
although declining in recent history. Applying the Actor
Network Theory, Fronek develops a framework capturing the
complexity of ICAwith multiple interactions in the context of
globalization. More recently, Fronek and Tilse (2010) carry
forth this earlier research into an Australian­Korean case
study, exploring the complexities of policy and international
practice between two country systems, including a discussion
of the use of the Internet in ICA.
From the United States, Roby and Matsumura's (2002)
research provides some insight into historical problems and
birth mother issues in another Pacific nation, the Marshall
Islands. From interviews with 73 birth mothers in 2001, it
was learned that most of the mothers had other children. The
reasons for relinquishment were found to be financial, spe-
cifically no means of support to care for the child. Also, when
the role of grandmothers was explored, it was found that they
were often helping with child care, and ultimately, they were
a part of the pressure for birth mother relinquishment. Also,
in a high birthrate community where abortion was not a legal
option for unwanted pregnancy, the problems were further
complicated by the fact that temporary child care assistance
or services were not available as a government service. Roby
and Matsumura also make important observations about
cultural ideas related to the continuity of the parent­child
relationship and that the conception of adoption does not
terminate the relationship. Informal care in the Marshall
6 SAGE Open
Islands existed to meet the needs of orphaned and vulnerable
children within the extended family and kin group. Authors
found that the child was viewed as a link or bridge between
two families, or a child could be given as a gift to the new
family. In turn, this would provide for and help the birth fam-
ily and kinship group of the child, a particularly complicated
ethical dilemma when this concept is applied to ICA.
In Roby, Wyatt, and Pettys' (2005) follow-up with a sur-
vey research study of open adoptions surveying U.S. families
who have adopted from the Marshall Islands, results include
motivations to adopt, willingness for openness, and insights
gained from their experiences. The results suggest that those
surveyed embraced openness but recognized that contact
with birth parents is difficult.
Roby and Maskew (in press) present a timely analysis and
discussion of child welfare and adoption systems reform in
the Marshall Islands as well as Cambodia. Applying the
human rights perspective, a historical overview of the
devel
opment of regulatory controls is useful when consid-
ering early stages of reform. This particular analysis further
captures the nature of small and impoverished nations and
their adoption transactions with far more powerful nations,
particularly the United States and Western Europe. Also
responding to the need for innovative interventions to support
families, Rotabi, Pennell, Roby, and Bunkers (in press) con-
sider Family Group Conferencing (FGC) as a culturally
adaptable intervention that has been codified into Marshall
Islands law and suggest its application in Guatemala. This
particular contribution to the literature exemplifies bridging
from social policy analysis to social intervention.
British scholar Dickens (2009), a social policy and child
welfare expert, lays out a framework of three ideological and
policy approaches of social services and ICA in receiving
nations: (a) liberal or neoliberal, (b) conservative corporatist,
and (c) social democratic, which he aligns to political phi-
losophies of libertarianism, utilitarianism, and egalitarianism,
respectively. The first approach is exemplified by the United
States and its private ICA system that has a service for a
purchase system within a free-market approach. In this sys-
tem, the state takes a minimal role in regulation and protec-
tion of the most vulnerable.
In keeping with the market-place ideology, there is an
emphasis on choice: prospective adopters and birth
parent(s) would be free to choose which agency to use,
and even to select one another. This leads to a highly
competitive market for healthy babies, exemplified by
on-line profiles of prospective adopters (effectively
advertisements) hoping that a birth parent will choose
them. (Dickens, 2009, pp. 597-598)
This leads to inevitable problems and market dynamics
in the private U.S. system and has been discussed by a num-
ber of social work scholars (e.g., Carstens & Juliá, 1995;
Freundlich, 2000, 1998).
In this same discourse about social policy and underlying
values, Dickens (1999), who worked for more than 3 years
in Romania (Gibbons & Rotabi, in press), presents a case
example with historical analysis of the self-imposed morato-
rium that was a result of multiple factors, including adoption
fraud and issues of goal displacement (Sarri et al., 1998) as
well as the nation's entry into the European Union (EU). This
particular discourse is important as it highlights the contex-
tual and political nature of ICA policy, illustrating underly-
ing values as well as how international pressure from the
EU affected country-specific child care policy, particularly
an ICA moratorium.
Dickens (1999) also writes about the emergence of social
workers in Romania and some of the challenges, especially in
a child welfare system that still heavily relied on both insti-
tutional care and ICA. Social workers were often drawn to
determine ICA as an appropriate care option because provid-
ing family support work and keeping children in their bio-
logical families were not valued or prioritized, especially
because it frequently involved working closely with the
Roma population, which was seen as degrading (Dickens,
1999). Therefore, Dickens argues that social workers could
focus on ICA as a way to avoid the discomfort or "low level"
work that typifies family support work (Dickens, 1999).
Referring a child to be adopted by a foreign family was a task
that was clearly defined and easy, and the social worker could
feel good about it. In some cases, the social worker could also
receive some kind of financial inducement for the referral in
a country where the average social worker's salary was
approximately US$55 to US$100 per month at the time.
Dickens (2009) shows how this was an understandable choice
for the individual social workers involved but was also
the "wider result in the weakening of domestic services"
(p. 601). Eventually, social workers became more recognized
in the child welfare system, and as other alternative means of
care such as foster care and domestic adoption became stron-
ger, the legal framework changed to prioritize domestic care
options, resulting in social work practice that is more focused
on family support and other care options within the contin-
uum. More recently, Nedelcu and Groza (in press) explore the
history of ICA and reform in Romania, shedding light on the
significant gains in domestic adoptions and other forms of
alternative care, such as foster care, in that nation. In sum,
the literature focused on Romania provides invaluable insight
on legal reform, institutions, foster care, and ICA dating back
to the earliest days of concern (Johnson, Edwards, & Puwak,
1993) to later literature that captures changes across a social
development continuum.
Focusing on outside social work influence including their
own, Dickens and Groza's (2004) historical review of child
"rescue" in Romania poses important considerations for prac-
tice and empowerment. These authors present four "short-
comings" and "difficulties" (p. 471) in the response to the
orphan crisis in that nation dating back to the early 1990s,
as follows: (a) a lack of coordination of voluntary
Rotabi and Bunkers 7
and international aid "helping" activities with Romanian
authorities; (b) displacement of Romanian child care/institu-
tional workers with programming developed by outsiders and
staffed with volunteers--often passing critical judgment on
the Romanian women who had dedicated their careers to work-
ing in the institutions; (c) a failure of international organiza-
tions to recognize that institutions actually "magnified the
general poverty of their local communities" (p. 472), and the
problem of Romanian staff becoming resentful of resource
donation to "orphans" when their own children and families
were without basic necessities (which reportedly led to staff
theft of medicines and other donated supplies); and (d) lim-
ited training of Romanian institutional staff--much of
which was targeted to bilingual staff and ultimately created
tensions and an inadequate sustainability plan. These prob-
lems contributed to the collapse of the child welfare system,
and with changes in the government and EU intervention,
new laws were developed--including profoster care legisla-
tion for deinstitutionalization of children. This reflective
piece is a summary of experiences that considers chal-
lenges and ethical issues of power and change with out-
sider or "expert" influence, concluding with "What is to be
the proper place of international agencies, in particular those
involved in inter-country adoption; and what are the respec-
tive roles and responsibilities of central and local govern-
ment?" (p. 485).
Exploitation, Ethics, Social Justice,
and Human Rights
Altstein and Simon's (1991) contributions to discourse in
social work about adoption practices and ethics were par-
ticularly important to beginning critical thinking from mul-
tiple and global perspectives. Herrmann and Kasper (1992)
sound one of the earliest and most alarming warnings in
social work peer review literature about the imbalance of
power between sending and receiving nations, focusing on
the exploitation of women and families in impoverished
environments. Also, in early discourse about morality and
ethics, Ngabonziza (1991) of International Social Service
observes that ICA
has developed because of modern means of commu-
nication, it is north-south and west-east oriented and
between rich and poor countries; provides children
from a surplus to a deficit area; in many instances
functions like a market and according to the laws of a
market; and takes place between members of an
advanced and well organized society with plenty of
social and legal institutions on the one hand and, on
the other, ad hoc institutions and or isolated individu-
als such as lawyers, magistrates, social workers, who
act as intermediaries, often motivated only by the
gain. (p. 100)
In Ngabonziza's (1991) discussion of global context, cul-
tural points are considered such as Islamic Shari'ah law that
does not recognize adoption and only allows for guardianship
(called Kefala)--a form of kinship care that is essentially
absent in social work research and literature (an exception is
Jaffe, 1991). Ngabonziza discusses "unbearable pressure
from adoptive parents and agencies" (p. 78), "child traffick-
ing" (p. 80), and a "lack of social work tradition" (p. 79) in
countries of origin. Combining the multiple underlying prob-
lems of countries of origin, Ngabonziza uses an admonishing
voice of a true abolitionist when he concludes
Given the magnitude of problems facing relinquishing
countries, intercountry adoption, even properly con-
ducted, is meaningless. It presents an idealized life for
small numbers of children as an alternative for global
policy. This is a duty for international cooperation and
cannot be solved by intercountry adoption. (p. 80)
From the United States, Hollingsworth (2003) writes
about the inherent social justice and exploitation issues, pre-
senting six distinct areas of concern:
(1) International adoption may exploit family poverty
in developing countries, (2) international adoption
may exploit social sanctions directed against disenfran-
chised children, (3) gender oppression and discrimina-
tion may be exploited for the purpose of adopting, (4)
children's rights to knowledge of and access to their
birth family may be placed at risk, (5) children's identi-
fication with their racial, ethnic, or national group may
be interrupted, and (6) children may be secured in ways
that involve abduction, sale, or trafficking. (p. 211)
Hollingsworth's (2003) view of ICA appears abolitionist
in approach; however, she pragmatically presents alternative
perspectives and acknowledges that ICA is not bad or
exploitative for all children and biological families. Also,
Hollingsworth notes that there is an alternative view of ICA
as an act of social justice itself--saving a child from extreme
poverty and life in an institution. It should be noted that this
view is shared by many who are promoters of ICA as a social
intervention and as promoters of the practice. Hollingsworth
(2008) again pragmatically follows up on these ideas in a
later commentary on the HCIA and its implications for cul-
tural identity, posing critical questions about just how protec-
tive the agreement can be for this important human rights
consideration.
From Britain, Triseliotis (2000), a prolific contributor to
adoption literature in general, challenges the conceptions
of ICA as a humanitarian good with his discussion titled
"Intercountry Adoption: Global Trade or Global Gift?"
Exploring the problematic dimensions of ICA, he ultimately
offers pragmatic and regulatory recommendations about
8 SAGE Open
how to "achieve greater legitimacy" (p. 45). Following are
five ways in which illegitimacy is manifested:
(1) a disregard for children's rights as set forth in the
UN Convention; (2) the absence of legality; (3) lack of
choice for birth parents; (4) disregard of empirically
based knowledge of what is known to be the best for
children; and (5) absence of an ethical base. (Triseliotis,
2000, p. 45)
Triseliotis (2000) states that, in this period of the late
1990s, ICA is often carried out
in the interests of adults . . . and the trafficking in chil-
dren that is a characteristic part of it, has set back the
clock for the rights of children and has been a bad
precedent for countries still struggling to develop
child-centered legislation. (p. 49)
Triseliotis (2000) identifies three ways in which ICA can
achieve legitimacy: (a) a rights-based approach to children,
(b) full international regulation, and (c) the practice of adop-
tion as a global gift. Regulatory controls such as the removal
of financial incentives are discussed, and in conclusion
Triseliotis critiques the HCIA as it "seems to have had little
impact . . . in stemming the trafficking in children . . . because
its articles are insufficient or weak or both" (p. 53).
Turning to the idea of an "ethical base" of practice as dis-
cussed by Triseliotis (2000), one cannot begin a discussion
about adoption ethics and social work without consideration
of Madeleine Freundlich's important and seminal contribu-
tions, including conceptions of supply and demand, benefi-
cence, and self-determination (Freundlich, 1998, 2000;
Freundlich & Phillips, 2000). In the Year 2000, Freundlich's
book Adoption and Ethics: The Market Forces in Adoption
was the most comprehensive social work summary of the
issues at hand, making a multidimensional analysis of the
supply and demand market model--posing critical questions
about rights and responsibilities.
Drawing on ethics and human rights, including Freundlich's
contributions, Roby and White's (2010) call for regulation of
adoption activities on the Internet, highlighting examples of
adoption fraud and technology applied to domestic and for-
eign adoptions. This is an important contribution as it high-
lights the use of technology for global transactions in the ICA
equation, including use of the Internet as a medium for mar-
keting of services and children, some of which crosses the
line into unethical and fraudulent practices.
Roby is a prolific contributor to the literature as it relates
to legal issues, ethics, and applied knowledge for reform.
Her 2007 article "From Rhetoric to Best Practice: Children's
Rights in Intercountry Adoption" pulls together many con-
cepts in this critically important analysis of the human rights
dimensions of ICA, providing a holistic overview of the con-
tinuum of rights with ICA as an important intervention. This
includes conceptions of rights prior to adoption such as the
right to a determination of adoptability and a child's right to
be placed with a family that has received appropriate pre-
placement training and preparation. Also, full family mem-
bership is presented as an adoptee's right of social acceptance
in addition to the rights of access to birth and identity records.
Importantly, Roby also discusses the child's right not to
become a commodity while being mindful of conditions of
poverty and birth family rights, including adoption into the
extended family and/or nonrelative adoption within the nation.
Roby's analysis is consistent with the Hague Convention and
concepts of the best interests of the child. This discourse is
continued in Roby and Ife's (2009) consideration of human
rights and reform and their presentation of a bottom-up
approach to change that includes birth family input.
Perspectives on Identity Formation, Family
Transition, and Child Development
Social work has made considerable contributions to research
about adoptees, identity, and race (Simon & Altstein, 2001;
Simon & Roorda, 2000). Important investigations include
identity development of Korean adoptees and family life
(e.g., Bergquist, 2004; Bergquist, Campbell, & Unrau, 2003;
Bergquist, Vonk, Kim, & Feit, 2007; Kim, 1977; McGinnis,
in press; Yoon, 2004), including the rarely researched topic
of openness in ICA (Hayes & Kim, 2007). Also, there are
important research results in the literature related to child
transition from country of origin to the new adopted home
and child development, including the institutional experience,
especially in Romania (e.g., Gavrilovici & Groza, 2007;
Groza, 1999; Pearlmutter, Ryan, Johnson, & Groza, 2008;
S. D. Ryan & Groza, 2004). Transracial socialization and
cultural competence have also received consideration (e.g.,
Crolley-Simic & Vonk, 2008; Vonk, 2001; Vonk & Angaran,
2001; Vonk & Massatti, 2008), including the testing of instru-
ments for transracial adoption parenting (Massatti, Vonk,
& Gregoire, 2004) and ethnic socialization of adoptees
(Mohanty, 2010). Later, adult adaptation of adoptees has also
been explored (Altstein et al., 1994), and adoptive parental
perceptions and satisfaction have been investigated (Bergquist
et al., 2003; Paulsen & Merighi, 2009). Reviewing the avail-
able literature provides an interesting look into the way that
research and recommendations of social workers have
evolved as ICA became more prominent. It is impossible to
truly give a full overview of all the social work literature in
this particularly robust area; however, the selected highlights
focused on reform are provided within the following sub-
themes of cultural identity and child development concerns
and caregiving strategies.
Cultural identity. Westhues and Cohen (1998) explore
trends in Canada and how changing attitudes have affected
adoption-related policy. The authors use ICA as a way to
explore the challenges of promoting a national-level policy
of multiculturalism and the balance required for accepting
Rotabi and Bunkers 9
the ethnicity and culture of the adopted child while recogniz-
ing and respecting the nonminority racial members of the
family and community as well. Carstens and Juliá (2000)
expand on the importance of adoptive families having an
awareness of and sensitivity to the child's country and culture
of origin. Research highlighted that U.S. adoptive families
who visited the child's country of origin prior to the adoption
demonstrated ethno-racial awareness that was positively cor-
related with the adopted child's sense of security and ethno-
cultural awareness. The authors strongly recommend that
U.S. adoption agencies should "encourage, support and
facilitate a visit to the adoptee's country of origin" as a means
of promoting an ethno-racial awareness of the child's
birth country by members of the adoptive family as well as
"encouraging strong ethnic identity formation in adopted
chil
dren" (Carstens & Juliá, 2000, p. 71). This recommenda-
tion is also promoted in Hollingsworth's (2008) exploration
of the HCIA and issues of cultural identity. Social workers
involved in adoption work are encouraged to share infor-
mation, research, and interventions related to cultural iden-
tity in an effort to support and promote knowledge about
identity development among adoptive parents (Holling-
sworth, 2008).
Child development concerns and caregiving strategies.Agreat
deal of social work literature highlighting child development
concerns in ICA (e.g., attachment issues) has focused pri-
marily on children being placed into ICAfrom Romania. The
severity of institutional care the majority of Romanian chil-
dren experienced pre-ICA provided fertile ground for explor-
ing lasting effects of institutionalization. Several studies
explore the link between parent­child relationship satisfac-
tion and consistent predictors of child emotional and behav-
ioral strength (Pearlmutter et al., 2008).
Roberson (2006) in her literature review on attachment
and caregiving behavior systems in ICA explores what kind
of caregiver strategies supported successful adjustment of the
adopted child into the family and encouraged secure attach-
ment. Issues related to institutional care prior to placement
are explored, and several longitudinal studies on the effect of
this type of care on long-term social and health issues are
identified (Roberson, 2006). Responsive and flexible parent-
ing is related to attachment security. Roberson recommends
that the identification of and knowledge about key protective
factors are important for social workers practicing ICA.
This strengths-based perspective is consistently found in
Groza's scholarship, a prolific body of ICA research. For
example, Groza and colleagues (Pearlmutter et al., 2008)
found that the relationship that adoptive children have with
their adoptive parents is the greatest key to understanding
parental perception of the current level of executive func-
tioning. The ability to identify these potential strengths in
the adoptive family as well as to prepare and support par-
ents regarding their own expectations of the adopted child
is an essential trait for social workers to have (Groza, Ryan
& Nelson, 2008; Pearlmutter et al., 2008). Cross-national
research on Romanian adoptees, explored by S. D. Ryan and
Groza (2004), found that although children being placed
from institutional care might be traumatized and suffer notice-
able developmental and cognitive delays, the strength of the
parent­child relationship can positively alter these effects (S.
D. Ryan & Groza, 2004). Providing information, helping par-
ents develop strategies to manage and decrease behavior
issues or problem areas, and recognizing unrealistic expecta-
tions are issues that social workers must address in the home
study and preparation phases of adoption. This kind of sup-
port and acknowledgment of potential issues in the adoptive
placement will help support positive attachment, develop-
ment, and cognitive outcomes for children (Roberson, 2006;
Welsh, Viana, Petrill, & Mathias, 2007). It should be noted
that this research is a continuation of Groza's earlier work
in Romania, which found care in institutions to be harmful to
children's development across multiple domains (Groza,
1999).
S. D. Ryan and Groza's (2004) comparison of adoptees
in the United States and Romania is an important study.
This large sample of 298 adoptive families incorporated
standardized measures including questions about parent­
child relationship and child behaviors. Child's impact on
the family was not statistically different between the two
groups, and the majority of the families in both countries
indicated the child's addition to be positive. Other findings
include the U.S. families having significantly lower levels
of trust with their child than was reported by Romanian
families. Overall, parent­child satisfaction had similar
findings with Romanian families being more satisfied with
their relationships. Other findings shed light on the parent­
child experience as it relates to their preplacement history,
including time spent in hospitals and institutions. In sum,
this study not only has important results but it also was
constructed holistically with two different cultural con-
texts. Its design is, in and of itself, an act of social justice,
as adoptive families in Romania are considered and even
valued as placement options for orphaned and vulnerable
children.
ChildWelfare Practice
Responding to issues of culture, identity, and family adjust-
ment, U.S. scholar Bailey (2006) pragmatically identifies
social workers as critical resources in minimizing the risk of
children losing their ethnic heritage in the ICA transition. A
practice model is presented to protect ethnic identity while
facilitating family formation grounded in the Social Identity
Theory. Bailey's model "promotes assessment of parents'
cultural understanding, education of children's identity needs,
and provision of resources and support for their education of
the child's birth culture" (p. 7). She identifies four principles:
(a) knowledgeable and culturally competent adoption agency
staff who (b) consistently deliver culturally competent adop-
tion services, and provide (c) support for parents as "cultural
10 SAGE Open
vanguards for their internationally adopted children" (p. 7)
in an (d) ethical manner that promotes the best interests of
the child.
British and U.S. authors Selinske et al. (2001) shed some
light on home study practices and the best interests of the
child in their analysis. They present case studies that serve as
examples of adoption disruptions and dissolutions in which
home studies were prepared by a U.K. based individual who
claimed social work training and then later was found to be
operating as an independent provider without appropriate
social work credentials. Because a U.S. citizen infant was
inappropriately placed with a British family that resulted in
adoption disruption/dissolution ending with repatriation of
the infant back to the United States, this case example is pro-
vocative. Ultimately, home study policy changes resulted and
the U.K. government banned independent contractor assess-
ments, and instead, local social service authorities (where the
family resides) are now responsible for home studies.
Removing private provider recommendations from the ICA
process addresses issues of pay-for-service/private adoption
assessments.
In a more recent analysis of home study regulation, Crea
(2009, in press) explores the application of the HCIA to
home study consistency in the United States. Crea identifies
problems of the past (e.g., notorious Russian cases) to illus-
trate the need for greater oversight of home studies. Reporting
on the variability in home study assessment practices, the
Structured Analysis Family Evaluation is presented as a
promising "means of standardizing the quality of assess-
ments" (p. 675). A high degree of practitioner satisfaction
is reported, as identified in previous studies (Crea, Barth, &
Chintapalli, 2007).
Turning to practices in countries of origin, Schmidt (2009),
based in the Czech Republic, discusses orphan care in Russia,
which has historically been one of the most frequent coun-
tries of origin of children for ICA in the world (Rotabi &
Heine, 2010). This author does not posit ICA as a social inter-
vention while focusing on deinstitutionalization. Schmidt
outlines three critical child welfare tasks: (a) prevention of
orphanhood through support mechanisms targeting biologi-
cal families, (b) development of family placement or kin-
ship care, and (c) "humanization of institutions," which she
defines as providing dignified care and child rights­based
care while destigmatizing institutionalized children. An
important discussion concerns research on Russian views
of adopting children from institutions, including a desire for
young children and barriers in the decision to actually adopt.
Schmidt concludes with a discussion about the role of social
workers whom she identifies as key actors in child rights,
empowerment practices, and social planning for family sup-
port and transformation of child welfare systems in general.
Another important research manuscript focused on prac-
tice in sending nations, written by Gibbons,Wilson, and Schnell
(2009), and on foster parents in the prereform Guatemalan
adoption system. This qualitative research study in which
Guatemalan foster mothers were interviewed found that
these intermediate families, bridging the time span between
child relinquishment and ICA with family-based care, were
"critical links" in the adoption process from that particular
nation. Findings help us better understand the role or work
of foster families in the child development outcomes of the
Guatemalan adoptees who benefited from this private care
strategy during the height of the ICA years in that nation.
Other findings in this study included the report by foster
mothers that poverty was the main reason for birth mother
relinquishment. This study is an exemplar of interdisciplin-
ary collaboration between two psychologists and a social
worker.
Methodological Approaches
Employed by Social Work
The majority of social work manuscripts on the subject of ICA
were highly conceptual, and analysis was most frequently
focused on policy or included policy implications. Case study
analyses are presented (e.g., Fronek & Tilse, 2010), and expe-
riences in the ICA process were frequently measured with
qualitative methods (e.g., Bailey, 2009a; Crolley-Simic &
Vonk, 2008; Roby & Matsumura, 2002; and Gibbons et al.,
2009, use of interviews), with some exceptions such as
Bergquist et al. (2003). This is not particularly surprising
given research ethics and the need for deep exploration of
meaning with vulnerable populations, especially with inter-
national contexts and cross-cultural research. The exception
to this was research in child development and institutional-
ization, identity formation and adjustment of adoptees, and
adoptive parenting (e.g., Groza, 1999; Pearlmutter et al.,
2008; S. D. Ryan & Groza, 2004) in which quantitative
research incorporated larger data sets and standardized mea-
sures in addition to development of scales for measurement
(Massatti et al., 2004; Mohanty, 2010).
Conclusion
In the 1990s and into the turn of the millennium, an era of rapid
globalization and an expanding adoption market emerged by
the Year 2000, and by 2004, there were as many as 45,000
children being adopted annually on a global basis. By
2011, there was at least a 50% decline in ICA placements
compared with the peak 2004 numbers (Selman, 2009, in
press), and an era of reform emerged as a result of regula-
tion under the Hague Convention and other factors previ-
ously discussed.
ICA is an excellent example of the transactional model of
social work practice and the global nature of human experi-
ences. It involves multiple dimensions and interactions of
human ecology, including social policy, fertility, and
access to health care, such as contraception, and human
rights, including rights of women, children, and families
(Hollingsworth, 2003). Also, economic opportunities on both
Rotabi and Bunkers 11
sides of the equation, including privilege versus poverty, are
critical as are other social and environmental problems such
as war, natural disaster, and health epidemics such as HIV/
AIDS in the context of globalization. Overlying social justice,
human rights, and social work ethics, the debates about how to
proceed in a conscientious manner, personally and politically
(Vonk et al., 1999), are multidimensional and endless. This is
especially true when considering the conditions and cultures
of each sending nation on a case-by-case basis. Preeminent
ethicist Peter Singer (2002) points out that "leaders of smaller
nations must . . . consider, in contexts like global warming,
trade pacts, foreign aid, and the treatment of refugees, to what
extent they are prepared to consider the interests of `outsid-
ers'" and "the value of the life of an innocent human being
does not vary according to nationality" (p. 4). However, and
unfortunately, the industry of ICA has pushed the margins of
this idea of human life "value" and, in some cases, taken
advantage of vulnerable families and crossed the line into
human trafficking under the guise of humanitarianism and
ICA (Rotabi & Gibbons, in press).
As ICA has been a highly unregulated and a multimillion-,
if not billion, dollar industry over the past 50 to 60 years
(Freundlich, 1998, 2000; Riben, 2007), it is in our position
that a new dawn has come in the era of globalization (Lyons,
2006) and requirements of the HCIA. Social work has a great
deal of insight to offer to prevent commodification of chil-
dren not just philosophically but also practically with a
craftsman's knowledge of child welfare, social justice,
human rights, social policy, and agency administrative prac-
tices in combination with the capacity to approach ICA prob-
lems with empirical rigor and a commitment to the ethical
principle of self-determination and professional competence
(Bromfield & Rotabi, in press; Freundlich, 2000; Roby &
Maskew, in press; Roby & Matsumura, 2002; Rotabi &
Bergquist, 2010; Rotabi & Gibbons, in press).
While we have presented a largely pragmatic position of
social workers, it should be noted that British social work
scholar Dickens (2009), who has made significant contribu-
tions to ICA literature, takes a radical position, challenging
the status quo:
The overall message is that even though ICA may offer
immediate benefits for some children, it is essential to end
it in the longer-term interests of all children. Given the
demand for ICA and the challenges faced by families and
governments in sending countries, it would be unrealistic
to expect a ban by itself to yield instant, unequivocal
results. Rather, ending ICA should be seen as a necessary
but not sufficient condition for a more equitable globaliza-
tion for children and families around the world. (p. 605)
This position, in addition to the radical decline in ICA
(Selman, 2009), places further urgency on the need for policy
and practice research. Fronek and Cuthbert (2011) suggest
an alternative paradigm, using a public health prevention
perspective, viewing children as "at risk" rather than "avail-
able" for ICA(p. 6). Changing notions about ICAdoes require
new lenses and an orientation toward biological family sup-
port as we consider the socioecological factors underlying
adoption, including structural and gender inequality (Fronek
& Cuthbert, 2011; Hollingsworth, 2003).
As authors, we agree with Fronek and Cuthbert's
(2011) and Roby's (2007) holistic approach as well as
Triseliotis (2000) who asserts that decisions about the best
interests of children are being made without adequate empiri-
cal evidence. Over a decade ago, he called for rigorous moni-
toring and evaluation of projects related to ICA, and this
recommendation continues to stand true today. This is ulti-
mately a call to action for social work researchers who are
committed to meeting standards of rigor and inquiry about
interventions across the continuum of child welfare and fam-
ily support, especially in low-resource countries that are typi-
cally countries of origin for children being placed into ICA.
In this literature review, it became obvious that the main
thrust of research on ICA focused on the child only after
adoptive family placement in industrialized nations (see
Welsh et al., 2007). This view is limited and even underscores
a social justice dimension in the kinds of research questions
being posed. It may be said that international adoptees are
one of the most overresearched small groups in the world,
and conclusions about developmental gains in family con-
text postinstitutional care are not particularly surprising.
While the evidence about attachment disorders and other
problems related to institutional experiences has been impor-
tant, much of this research ultimately ignores millions of
children left behind in institutions, on the streets of urban
centers, or in fragile circumstances with older adults or
child-headed households as is frequent in Africa due to HIV/
AIDS (Zimmer & Dayton, 2005). In addition, important ele-
ments of the child's entire life, which most likely were of
great significance in the overall development and related
outcomes of the child, are often treated superficially. We
recommend that research provide a more holistic view of
the child. This means more research needs to focus on chil-
dren in their countries of origin, which requires international
research collaboration and strengthening schools of social
work and other social sciences in countries of origin to
develop the capacity of researchers outside of North
America and Western Europe. Strengthening capacity at this
level is not only right for many reasons, but it will make
possible research prior to child placement in ICA.
Related to this, the literature review identified a signifi-
cant lack of social work literature on birth families, espe-
cially for ICA, which has led Wiley and Baden (2005) to
acknowledge that birth mothers are "permanently invisible
and silent" (p. 14) with some exceptions (e.g., Roby &
Matsumura, 2002). This is also true about institutional child
caregivers and foster parents and their perspective on
12 SAGE Open
alternative care of children, the continuum that may lead to
ICA, as they are not heard as key informants in the literature.
Also, those social workers who have engaged in ICA in
sending nations, such as Russian or Chinese nationals, are
also silent. They undoubtedly have important insight.
As supporting birth families/kinship and domestic adop-
tion is critically important, we are left with some important
questions. For kinship groups, especially in traditional soci-
eties, how may they be supported to retain guardianship of
children so that the children may be afforded the opportunity
and the right to remain in their families of origin? This ques-
tion is particularly relevant to grandparent care or sibling
care, especially related to children orphaned by HIV/AIDS
(Lightfoot & Kalomo, 2010; Maundeni, 2009; Roby & Shaw,
2006; Zimmer & Dayton, 2005). Also, what are the percep-
tions about domestic adoption and how may we strengthen
such an approach, especially in frequent countries of origin
such as Russia, China, Guatemala, and Ethiopia? Are tradi-
tional care practices such as in traditional societies like
Ethiopia (Bunkers et al., in press) being disparaged because
they are considered informal? How might large-scale institu-
tions become a model of the past in favor of small-group care
models in Botswana or foster care in Romania? In countries
with unique dynamics, like South Korea's use of birth mother
homes and shame of illegitimacy, how do particular interven-
tions support or hinder ethical ICA practice? In relation to
open adoptions, how may we continue to define this concept
as a preference indicated by families in the Marshall Islands?
Also, in that nation, how is the important social intervention
of FGC affecting practice (Roby & Ife, 2009; Rotabi et al.,
in press)? And is this intervention adaptable to other con-
texts? In regards to the Hague Convention, can FGC protect
orphaned and vulnerable children and the families who gave
birth to them (Rotabi & Gibbons, in press)?
These are just a few of the pressing concerns for social
workers around the globe. A multidisciplinary road map for
research must be developed. Specifically, research targeting
the many aspects of the best interests principle in all stages
of the ICA process, across the continuum of child care and
family support, is highly recommended given the very lim-
ited research available on this most fundamental of child
welfare conceptions related to ICA. To integrate these ideas,
a stretching of concepts and research boundary spanning is
necessary, including greater interdisciplinary collaboration
and openness to indigenous social workers and child rights
advocates engaged in practice, and deeper analysis that must
be holistic with practical considerations for the continuum of
care (Fronek & Cuthbert, 2011; Roby, 2007). This is exem-
plified by Gibbons et al.'s (2009) collaborative exploration
of the foster mother role and experience in Guatemalan
adoptions. Another example is interdisciplinary collabora-
tion combining social work and law scholarship exemplified
by Roby and Maskew's (in press) analysis of legal reform as
a process in the Marshall Islands and Cambodia.
Interdisciplinary partnerships are important for deeper
exploration of the best interests of the child and the subsid-
iarity principle of the Hague Convention to continue to
investigate and support improved practices and ultimately
promote the human rights of all involved in the ICAequation.
We agree with Fronek and Cuthbert's (2011) assertion that we
must move from a child being "available" for ICA to a child
"at risk" for ICA perspective to truly implement social inter-
ventions oriented toward social justice and human rights.
Although some may view this as an abolitionist positioning,
it is ultimately a pragmatic perspective as countless children
will still remain appropriate for ICA even with a concerted
effort toward prevention.
