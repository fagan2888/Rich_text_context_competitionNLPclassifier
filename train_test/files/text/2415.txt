Recent Victimization Exposure and Suicidal
Ideation in Adolescents
Heather A. Turner, PhD; David Finkelhor, PhD; Anne Shattuck, MA; Sherry Hamby, PhD
Objective: To examine the independent and cumula-
tive effects of past-year exposure to several different types
of child victimization (peer victimization, witnessing fam-
ily violence, community violence, sexual assault, and mal-
treatment) on suicidal ideation in a nationally represen-
tative sample of adolescents.
Design: The study used 2 waves of longitudinal data from
the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence.
Setting: Conducted in 2008 and 2010 on the tele-
phone with respondents from the contiguous United
States.
Participants: National sample of 1186 youth aged 10
to 17 years in wave 1.
Main Exposures: Peer victimization, sexual assault, wit-
nessing family violence, exposure to community vio-
lence, and maltreatment by a parent/caregiver.
Outcome Measure: Self-report suicidal ideation in the
past month.
Results: Controlling for demographic characteristics, in-
ternalizing disorder diagnoses, and wave 1 suicidal ide-
ation, findings showed independent effects of peer victim-
ization, sexual assault, and maltreatment by a parent/
caregiver on suicidal ideation at wave 2. The risk of suicidal
ideation was 2.4 times greater among youth who experi-
enced peer victimization in the past year, 3.4 times greater
among those who were sexually assaulted, and 4.4 times
greater among those exposed to maltreatment, relative to
children who were not exposed to these types of victim-
ization. Findings also showed substantial effects of poly-
victimization (exposure to 7 or more individual types of
victimization in the past year), with polyvictims almost 6
times more likely to report suicidal ideation.
Conclusion: Findings point to the importance of re-
cent victimization in increasing risk of suicidal ideation
in adolescents and suggest the need for victimization as-
sessments among all youth who are believed to be at risk
for suicidal ideation.

YOUTH SUICIDE REMAINS A SUB-
stantial concern, represent-
ing the third leading cause
of death for adolescents in
the United States. From
1999 to 2006, 11% of all deaths among 12-
to 19-year-olds were due to suicide, rep-
resenting more than 16 000 deaths every
year.1 Suicidal ideation, thoughts of harm-
ing or killing oneself,2 lies on a con-
tinuum of suicidal behavior and may be
an important precursor to suicide at-
tempts.3-6 A national epidemiological sur-
vey of adolescents in the United States
found that 19% of high school students had
suicidal ideation in the past year.7
There is reason to suspect that child-
hood exposure to violence and victimiza-
tion are important determinants of sui-
cidal ideation. A number of studies have
shown that sexual assault and child mal-
treatment, such as physical abuse, are sig-
nificant predictors of suicidal ideation and
attempts.8-15 Recent media reports of ado-
lescents driven to suicide following bully-
ing at school also suggest the role of peer-
perpetrated victimization on suicidal
behavior. Although these reports are anec-
dotal, several empirical studies have also
found significant effects of peer bullying on
suicidal ideation.16-18
Most past studies considering the im-
pact of child victimization on suicidal ide-
ation focused on only 1 form of victimiza-
tion,suchassexualabuseorschoolbullying.
However, recent findings have demon-
strated that victimized youth are often ex-
posed to multiple forms of victimization,
even within a 1-year period.19 Focusing on
only 1 or a few types of the large spectrum
of victimizations that children experience
is likely to underestimate the full strength
of the relationship between victimization
and suicidal ideation. At the same time, a
narrow focus on specific types can lead to
an overestimation of the impact of indi-
vidual victimization experiences, since out-
comes may be related to other victimiza-

tion types or their co-occurrence rather than to the target
event.
This suggests the need to assess victimization more
comprehensively to address the independent effects of
different types of victimization and the cumulative ef-
fects of exposure to multiple forms. Indeed, research has
demonstrated the particularly damaging effects of "poly-
victimization," ie, exposure to multiple forms of victim-
ization, on child trauma symptoms.20,21 This research is
also consistent with suicidal ideation studies finding a
"dose-response" relationship between the number of
childhood adversities and suicidal behavior.22-24
A substantial relationship exists between mental health
problems and suicidal ideation. Mood and anxiety dis-
orders, in particular, are strong predictors of suicidal be-
havior.11,22,25,26 Youth with these diagnoses are also at in-
creased risk for subsequent victimization.27,28 Thus, failure
to account for youth mental disorder, especially inter-
nalizing disorders, is likely to inflate associations be-
tween victimization and suicidal ideation.
There are a number of methodological problems and
limitations associated with much of the existing research
in this area. For example, many studies are based on small
selective samples, such as clinical samples with particular
disorders or hospital inpatient samples, making it diffi-
cult to generalize findings to the general population of ado-
lescents. Also, studies have often relied on retrospective re-
ports using substantial lag times between childhood abuse
exposureandadultsuicidalideationassessments.Suchstud-
ies are open to problems with recall bias and make it dif-
ficult to speak to the causal processes involved. Most stud-
ies addressing this issue are also cross-sectional in design,
further reducing the ability to establish temporal order of
suicidal thoughts and victimization. Longitudinal studies
that allow researchers to control for previous suicidal
ideation to assess the effects of recent victimization on
subsequent suicidal ideation would better assess the causal
role of victimization on this outcome. Finally, as noted
earlier, existing studies have typically focused on only 1
formofvictimizationandhaveoftenreliedonlimited1-item
measures.
STUDY OBJECTIVES
The current research used 2 waves of longitudinal data to
examine the effects of several forms of victimization on
suicidal ideation in a nationally representative sample of
adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. The objectives were to

METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
These analyses use data from the National Survey of Chil-
dren's Exposure to Violence, a 2-wave longitudinal study of a
representative sample of US children and adolescents. The Na-
tional Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence was de-
signed to obtain incidence and prevalence estimates of a wide
range of childhood victimizations. The wave 1 survey was con-
ducted between January 2008 and May 2008 with a nationally
representative sample of 4549 children aged 0 to 17 years liv-
ing in the contiguous United States. The wave 2 survey was con-
ducted approximately 2 years later between January 2010 and
November 2010. Interviews with parents and youth were con-
ducted over the telephone by the employees of an experienced
survey research firm.
The primary foundation of the wave 1 design was a nation-
wide sampling frame of residential telephone numbers from
which a sample of telephone households was drawn by ran-
dom digit dialing. This nationally representative cross-section
represented 67% of the 4549 completed interviews. To ensure
that the study included a sizeable proportion of minorities and
low-income respondents for more accurate subgroup analy-
ses, we also oversampled African American, Hispanic, or low-
income households. This "oversample" yielded 33% of the com-
pleted interviews. Sample weights were calculated for wave 1
to adjust for differential probability of selection due to (1) study
design, (2) demographic variations in nonresponse, and (3)
variations in within-household eligibility.
In wave 2, efforts were made to recontact wave 1 respon-
dents and elicit their participation. A total of 2497 children who
were aged 0 to 17 years at wave 1 took part in both waves (55%
of the original sample). The remaining 45% of the original sample
who did not participate consisted of respondents at wave 1 who
did not wish to be contacted for wave 2 (5%), those whose tele-
phone numbers were no longer active residential numbers (9%)
or were no longer associated with the original household (8%),
respondents who refused participation (9%), and failure to reach
respondents at scheduled callbacks (13%). The current study
focuses on the 1186 children who participated in both waves
and who were aged 10 to 17 years in wave 1.
RESPONSE RATES AND NONRESPONSE
ANALYSES AND WEIGHTING
The wave 1 cooperation rate for the random digit dialing cross-
section portion of the survey was 71% and the response rate
was 54%. The cooperation and response rates associated with
the smaller oversample were somewhat lower at 63% and 43%,
respectively. We compared parent reports of adolescents who
completed the interview with parent reports for adolescent non-
responders for 10- to 17-year-old participants. Nonre-
sponders were not systematically different from respondents
on factors related to victimization risk (details of the nonre-
sponse analyses can be obtained on request).
Fifty-seven percent of the subsample used in this study (re-
spondents aged 10-17 years in wave 1) completed an inter-
view in wave 2. To adjust for differential attrition by demo-
graphic factors, victimization, and trauma symptom levels, a
new set of sample weights was calculated for wave 2 using both
the wave 1 sample weights and propensity scores based on the
likelihood of each wave 1 case returning for wave 2. This method
of adjusting for nonresponse is outlined by Wun et al.29

MEASUREMENT
Victimization
Both waves of this survey used an enhanced version of the Ju-
venile Victimization Questionnaire.19 The Juvenile Victimiza-
tion Questionnaire includes questions, known as "screeners,"
about specific types of victimization. Individual screeners can
be grouped into aggregate types representing general classes
of victimization.
This study used 5 aggregate types of victimization that oc-
curred within the past year at both waves: peer-perpetrated vic-
timization, maltreatment, sexual assault, witnessing family vio-
lence, and exposure to community violence. The individual
screeners used to construct each of these aggregates are shown
in the eAppendix (http://www.archpediatrics.com). For each
aggregate victimization type, children were coded as 1 if they
responded yes to any past-year occurrence of 1 or more of the
screeners used to construct the aggregate.

was coded as 1 for polyvictims and 0 for non-polyvictims. Con-
sistentwithearlierresearch,thiscutoffidentifiesroughlythetop
10% of children in terms of multiple victimization levels.20,30
Suicidal Ideation
One item from the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Children31
was used to assess suicidal ideation. In both waves, respondents
were asked, "In the last month, how often have you wanted to
kill yourself? Would you say not at all, sometimes, often, or very
often?" A binary suicidal ideation variable was created in which
responses of "never" were coded as 0 and responses of "some-
times," "often," and "very often" were coded as 1.
Internalizing Disorder Diagnosis
In the parent portion of the survey of both waves, parents were
asked if their child had ever been diagnosed with any of sev-
eral disorders. Children whose parents reported that they had
been diagnosed with either posttraumatic stress disorder, an
anxiety disorder other than posttraumatic stress disorder, or
depression were coded as 1 for having ever been diagnosed with
an internalizing disorder.
Demographics
Demographic information was obtained in the parent interview,
including the child's sex, age (in years), and race/ethnicity (coded
into4groups:whitenon-Hispanic,blacknon-Hispanic,otherrace
non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race). Family structure, defined
by the composition of the household, was categorized into 4
groups: children living with (1) 2 biological or adoptive parents,
(2) 1 biological parent plus partner (spouse or nonspouse), (3)
singlebiologicalparent,and(4)othercaregiver.Sex,age,andrace
were obtained from the wave 1 interview. Since family structure
could have changed between the 2 waves of data, we used family
structure reported at wave 2.

interview, the percentage of female respondents reporting
ideation was almost twice that of male respondents. Al-
though there were no substantial differences between ado-
lescents living with 2-parent families and those living with
a single parent or other adults, almost 11% of respondents
living in a stepfamily or with a parent and unmarried part-
ner reported suicidal ideation--more than 3 times the per-
centage reported by those living with both biological or
adoptive parents. There were no significant differences in
suicidal ideation across race or between respondents who
were aged 12 to 15 vs 16 to 19 years at wave 2.
There were substantial differences in suicidal ide-
ation between adolescents who were exposed to specific
categories of victimization in the preceding year relative
to those who were not. More than 8% of respondents who
were peer victimized and more than 11% of those youth
who witnessed family violence reported suicidal ide-
ation in the past month, while suicidal ideation among
those without these types of exposures was 2.9% and 3.5%,
respectively.Theformsofvictimizationassociatedwiththe
greatest percentage of youth reporting ideation in-
cluded maltreatment (16% of maltreated adolescents
reported suicidal ideation in contrast to 2.7% of non-
maltreated youth) and sexual assault (23% of those sexu-
ally assaulted reported ideation vs 3.7% among nonas-
saulted adolescents). Youth who were polyvictimized, that
is, who were exposed to 7 or more individual types of vic-
timization, were also substantially more likely to report
suicidal ideation, with almost 16% of these youth report-
ing suicidal ideation in the past month.
We then conducted multivariate logistic regression
analyses to examine the effect of each past-year aggre-
gated victimization type on suicidal ideation, control-
ling for demographic factors and the other forms of vic-
timization. To increase our confidence that victimization
exposure temporally preceded and contributed to sui-
cidal ideation, we also controlled for suicidal ideation
at wave 1 and whether the respondent had ever been di-
agnosed with an internalizing disorder. Table 2 pre-
sents these analyses, where odds ratios have been con-
verted to approximate relative risk ratios.32
As seen in model 1, sex and family structure continued
to be related to suicidal ideation, with all other demograph-
ics and all 4 victimization aggregates controlled. Al-
though witnessing family violence and exposure to com-
munity violence were not significantly associated
withsuicidalideation,maltreatment,peervictimization,and
sexual assault were independently related to wave 2 sui-
cidal ideation. Peer-victimized youth had almost 2.4 times
the risk of suicidal ideation, those sexually assaulted in the
past year had about 3.4 times the risk, and those who were
maltreated had almost 4.4 times the risk of suicidal ide-
ation. As expected, having been diagnosed with an inter-
nalizing disorder and suicidal ideation at baseline were also
substantially related to wave 2 suicidal ideation. Twenty-
two percent of the variance (pseudo R2) in wave 2 suicidal
ideation was explained by the model.
Instead of focusing on the independent effects of the
5 types of victimization, model 2 of Table 2 considers the
effects of polyvictimization--exposure to at least 7 in-
dividual forms of victimization in the past year. Polyvic-
tims were almost 6 times more likely to experience an
onset of suicidal ideation at wave 2. All the controls that
were significant in model 1 were also significant here,
with odds ratios similar in magnitude. About 17% of the
variance in suicidal ideation was explained by this model.
COMMENT
The current study advances research on predictors of ado-
lescent suicidal ideation by (1) considering exposure to
multiple types of victimization in the same study, (2) as-
sessing more proximal victimization exposure than has
been typical of past research, (3) controlling for inter-
nalizing disorder diagnoses and past suicidal ideation, and
(4) using a nationally representative sample.
Findings indicated that, with the exception of com-
munity violence, suicidal ideation was significantly more
common among adolescents who had experienced any
form of victimization, including sexual assault, peer vic-
timization, witnessing family violence, and maltreat-
ment. Moreover, when considered in multivariate analy-
ses, 3 of these categories of victimization showed

significant effects on onset of suicidal ideation, indepen-
dent of the other victimization types, demographic fac-
tors, and internalizing disorder diagnoses: peer victim-
ization, sexual assault, and maltreatment.
Adolescents who experienced peer victimization within
the past year were almost 2.5 times more likely to think
about killing themselves than those who had not been vic-
timizedbypeers.Theimportanceofrecentexposuretopeer
victimization, even when controlling for other forms of vic-
timization, certainly lends credence to concerns about bul-
lying among youth and its potential contribution to teen
suicide. The findings also showed a substantial indepen-
dent effect of sexual assault on suicide ideation, consis-
tent with past research on the traumatic, stigmatizing, and
shame-producingqualitiesofthisformofvictimization.33-35
However,maltreatmentbyacaregiverwasassociatedwith
greatest risk. Adolescents who had experienced physical
abuse, emotional maltreatment, neglect, and/or custodial
interferenceinthepastyearwerealmost4.5timesmorelikely
to experience the onset of suicidal ideation. Thus, in con-
trasttotheassumptionthatmaltreatmentisprimarilyaprob-
lemofyoungchildren36 andthatparentalinfluencedeclines
inadolescence,37-40 thesefindingspointtotheparticularim-
portance of interactions with parents and other caregivers
on adolescent well-being.
Although seeking explanations for the particularly
strong influence of maltreatment is beyond the scope of
this research, it may be that abuse by caregivers--those
on whom youth typically depend for safety, stability, and
nurturance--may be especially likely to engage feelings
of hopelessness. "Hopelessness," a system of cognitive
schemas that emphasizes negative expectations for the
future,41,42 has been identified in a variety of studies as
being associated with suicidal behavior.43-47 Indeed, sev-
eral studies have noted the connection between child mal-
treatment and the development of hopelessness in both
children and adults.45,48,49
Polyvictimization emerged as the most powerful pre-
dictor of suicidal ideation. Exposure to many different
forms of victimization likely reflects significant adver-
sity across multiple contexts of adolescents' lives. For such
youth, victimization represents more of a life condition
than a set of events. Cross-context victimization may also
damage adolescents' potential for resiliency by creating
deficits in social and personal resources (such as social
support and self-esteem) that would normally help to
moderate the negative effects of victimization. Future re-
search should attempt to better specify the mechanisms
that make child polyvictimization a particularly strong
predictor of suicidal ideation.
Another noteworthy finding was the substantial asso-
ciation between suicidal ideation and living in a house-
hold with a stepparent or unmarried parent partner. Al-
thoughpastresearchhasdocumentedgreatervictimization
exposure in stepfamily households,50 in the current study,
victimization did not fully explain the association be-
tween family structure and suicidal ideation. The particu-
larly strong association with stepfamily households is wor-
risome and warrants more attention in future research.
This study uncovered a smaller percentage of adoles-
cents reporting suicidal ideation than has been found in
other epidemiological surveys. The discrepancy likely re-
flects differences in the assessment period. We used a mea-
sure that asked youth about thoughts of suicide during
the past month, while most other studies have used mea-
sures that ask about the past year or lifetime.7,10,22 Ad-
vantages to our more proximal shorter-period assess-
ment include clearer temporal ordering between recent
victimization and suicidal ideation and less likelihood of
recall bias. However, the lower numbers reporting ide-
ation leave less statistical power to detect associations and
do not allow for subgroup analyses.
CONCLUSIONS
These findings emphasize the need to include compre-
hensive victimization assessment in adolescent suicide
prevention and intervention efforts, recognizing the par-
ticular significance of polyvictimization. Similarly, treat-
ment responses to sexual assault, peer-perpetrated vic-
timization, and child maltreatment must recognize the
increased risk of suicidal behavior among victims. Al-
though much research in this area has focused on neu-
rological risks and psychopharmacologic interventions,
these findings point to the importance of the environ-
ment and the value of victimization prevention in reduc-
ing suicidal behavior. A comprehensive approach to sui-
cide prevention needs to address the safety of youth in
their homes, schools, and neighborhoods.
