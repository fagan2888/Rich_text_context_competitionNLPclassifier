Air Pollution, Economic Development of Communities, and Health Status Among
the Elderly in Urban China
Rongjun Sun and Danan Gu
Initially submitted March 18, 2008; accepted for publication July 30, 2008.
In Western societies, the impact of air pollution on residents' health is higher in less wealthy communities.
However, it is not clear whether such an interaction effect applies to developing countries. The authors examine
how the level of community development modifies the impact of air pollution on health outcomes of the Chinese
elderly using data from the third wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey in 2002, which includes
7,358 elderly residents aged 65 or more years from 735 districts in 171 cities. The results show that, compared with
a 1-point increase in the air pollution index in urban areas with a low gross domestic product, a similar increase in
the air pollution index in areas with a high gross domestic product is associated with more difficulties in activities of
daily living (odds ratio ¼ 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 1.83), instrumental activities of daily living (linear
coefficient ¼ 0.98, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.37), and cognitive function (linear coefficient ¼ 2.67, 95% CI: 1.97, 3.36), as
well as a higher level of self-rated poor health (odds ratio ¼ 2.20, 95% CI: 1.68, 2.86). Contrary to what has been
found in the West, Chinese elderly who live in more developed urban areas are more susceptible to the effect of air
pollution than are their counterparts living in less developed areas.

This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on the role
of urban economic development in the association between
air pollution and individual health status in a non-Western
social setting. As China's gross domestic product (GDP) qua-
drupled between 1978 and 2002 at an annual growth rate of
8%, increased air pollution became a detriment to the health
of its citizens. Seven of the 10 most polluted cities in the world
are now found in China (1). The history of world indus-
trialization has shown that urban economic development has
been accompanied by extensive environmental burdens that
have profound consequences on residents' well-being (2­4).
Both short- and long-term adverse effects of air pollution on
individual health are well documented in the literature and
include upper respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart dis-
ease, and damage to nerves and the brain (5­9).
Most of these studies, however, follow an ecologic design,
which is based on correlations between air pollution in a given
area and health outcomes at the population level, such as
mortality rates, rates of specific diseases (e.g., respiratory
and cardiovascular diseases), and hospital admissions. Indi-
vidual characteristics are not controlled for even though re-
search has shown that the effect of air pollution depends on
individual characteristics, including age, sex, and lifestyle
(10). As a result, it is critical to adjust for potentially con-
founding factors at the individual level (9, 11).
Furthermore, most studies that have explored the interac-
tion effect between community economic status and air pol-
lution on individual health have been limited to Western
societies. Most findings suggest that air pollution has a greater
impact on people living in economically disadvantaged com-
munities, which may be attributed to higher exposure to air
pollutants, lack of access to health care, and greater suscepti-
bility to the detrimental effect of pollution (12, 13). It is not
clear, however, whether such findings can be generalized to

countries that are at a different stage of economic develop-
ment. In addition, few studies have focused on the elderly
population, which is a fast-growing segment in both devel-
oped and developing countries. The elderly are more suscep-
tible to harm from toxic substances because of their depressed
immune systems, existing diseases, and the accumulation of
toxic agents in their bodies (14, 15). In this study, based on
a large-scale survey of the elderly in China, we address the
following questions: 1) Is there an independent effect of air
pollution on the health status of the elderly after individual
characteristics and community economic development are
controlled? 2) How does economic development modify the
effect of air pollution on health status?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
This study uses data from the third wave of the Chinese
Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2002.
The first wave of the CLHLS in 1998, which included only
seniors aged 80 or more years, covered 22 provinces in
China, where more than 85% of the national population
reside. The respondents were followed up in the second
wave in 2000. In the third wave in 2002, the CLHLS added
younger elders aged 65­79 years to the original respondents,
resulting in a sample size of 15,940. All the respondents in
the 2002 wave were interviewed between April and October.
Specific timeframes varied by province. Information was
obtained through in-home interviews. To include the elderly
of all ages, we use only the third wave of the CLHLS in this
analysis. Because pollution data are available for urban
areas only, where the concentration of pollution is usually
higher compared with rural areas, individuals living in rural
areas are excluded from this analysis. The final sample in-
cludes 7,358 elderly residents living in 735 city districts
from 171 cities (refer to Web Appendix 1 for distribution
of city districts). (This information is described in the first of
4 supplementary appendixes; each is referred to as ``Web
Appendix'' in the text and is posted on the Journal's website
(http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).) Systematic assessments of
the CLHLS indicate that the data quality is high (16­18).
Health outcome variables
Health outcomes are measured by 4 variables that reflect
overall health condition: activities of daily living, instru-
mental activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, and
self-rated health.
The term ``activities of daily living'' refers to the ability
to perform any of the following basic personal-care activi-
ties: 1) bathing, 2) dressing, 3) eating, 4) indoor transferring,
5) toileting, and 6) continence. Because its distribution is
highly skewed in this sample, with 66% reporting no dif-
ficulty performing any of these activities, we dichotomize
it into ``disabled'' (having at least 1 activities of daily living
limitation) and ``no limitation,'' with the latter as the reference
category.
The term ``instrumental activities of daily living'' refers
to the ability to perform any of the following items:
1) visiting neighbors, 2) shopping, 3) cooking, 4) washing
clothes, 5) walking 1 km, 6) lifting 5 kg, 7) crouching and
standing up 3 times, and 8) taking public transportation.
Choices for each item are ``able to do without help,'' ``need
some help,'' and ``need full help,'' with scores from 1 to 3,
respectively. The final score of instrumental activities of
daily living is the sum of all 8 items and ranges from 8 to
24, with higher scores indicating more difficulty.
Cognitive impairment is measured by the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) (19), which covers the follow-
ing aspects of cognitive functioning: orientation, registra-
tion, duplication and design, calculation, recall, naming, and
language. It was adapted to the cultural and socioeconomic
conditions in China (20). For example, the respondents were
asked to name as many foods as possible instead of to write
a sentence, which is an impossible task for many members
of this age group, many of whom are illiterate. For the
current sample, the reliability of the MMSE scale is high
(Cronbach's a ¼ 0.96). The MMSE score in this sample
ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores suggesting more
impairment.
Self-rated health has been shown to be an effective mea-
sure of individual health status (21, 22). It is assessed by
a general question: ``In general, would you say your health
is 1) very good, 2) good, 3) so so, 4) bad, or 5) very bad?''
Because the distribution is skewed (choices of 4 and 5
account for less than 15% of the whole sample), we combine
the responses into the following 2 categories: ``poor'' (com-
biningchoices 3­5)and ``good'' (combiningchoices 1 and2),
with the latter as the reference category.
Community socioeconomic status and air pollution
measures
Community socioeconomic status is measured by the GDP
per capita of each city district in 2000 (23). To capture a pos-
sible nonlinear relation between the GDP per capita and in-
dividual health outcomes, we used the cutoffs adopted by the
World Bank in 2002, which classified countries and regions
into 5 categories based on annual income per capita: poverty
( $365), low income ($366­$745), lower-middle income
($746­$2,975), upper-middle income ($2,976­$9,205), and
high income (>$9,205) (http://siteresources.worldbank.org/
DATASTATISTICS/Resources/OGHIST.xls). Because the
highest city district GDP per capita in our sample was about
$2,367, we classified the 735 city districts into 3 GDP cate-
gories: low, medium, and high, corresponding to the 3 lowest
categories characterized by the World Bank.
Air pollution is measured by the air pollution index at the
city level, shared by districts within the same city. The air
pollution index is widely used in environmental research as
a measure of general air pollution (24, 25). It assesses the
concentration of 3 pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide,
and inhalable particulates (consisting of particulate matter of
<10 lm in diameter, carbon monoxide, and ozone) (refer to
Web Appendix 2 for details). They are among the most com-
mon air pollutants found in China as well as other developing
countries (26­28). City air pollution indexes in this analysis
were obtained from the Chinese Natural Resources Database
(http://www.naturalresources.csdb.cn/zy/english/database.asp),

which is managed by the Institute of Geographical Sciences
and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sci-
ences. Since the health outcome variables adopted in this
study reflect health status rather than immediate, specific
health responses, we used air pollution indexes for the year
of 1995 to take into account the chronic or lagged response
to air pollution. Research has shown that air pollution could
yield significant mid- or long-term effects on health or mor-
tality, but it has been overlooked in the literature (29). The
air pollution index is graded from 1 to 7, with lower scores
indicating better quality.
Control variables
Weather can be an important potential confounder to the
relation between air pollution level and health status. In this
study, we added the average temperature of each city in
January as a control variable.
We also control the following variables at the individual
level (30, 31): Demographic variables include age (centered
at age 65 years), sex, and ethnicity (Han vs. non-Han). In-
dividual socioeconomic status consists of education (1­6
years of schooling, 7 years or more, vs. none), occupation
(white-collar occupation vs. others), and perceived family
economic conditions (good vs. poor). Family network re-
sources include marital status (currently married vs. not
married) and the number of living children. Health behaviors
include whether the respondent ever smoked (yes vs. no),
drank any alcohol (yes vs. no), and regularly exercised (yes
vs. no) in the past 5 years. Finally, an index was constructed
to measure engagement in leisure activities. It is the total
number of 7 activities in which the respondent was regularly
involved: gardening, raising poultry or pets, other outdoor
activities, reading, playing cards/mah-jong, listening to
radio/watching television, and involvement in organized
activities. The index ranges from 0 to 7.
Statistical analysis
We applied 2-level hierarchical models to analyze the
data (32) to take into account the variability at both individ-
ual and city district levels. Specifically, 2-level linear regres-
sions were used to model the 2 continuous outcome
variables (instrumental activities of daily living and
MMSE), while 2-level logistic regressions were used to
examine the 2 binary outcome variables (activities of daily
living and self-rated health) (refer to Web Appendix 3 for
more details). Two sequential models were fit for the 4 out-
come variables. Model 1 examines the main effects of the air
pollution index and community socioeconomic status on
health outcomes after adjusting for all individual-level fac-
tors. Model 2 investigates the interaction effects of the air
pollution index with community socioeconomic status. All
analyses were conducted by using STATA, version 10.0,
software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Table 1 describes the characteristics of all variables in-
cluded in this analysis. Tables 2 and 3 show the results of the
multilevel analysis of the 2 continuous outcome variables
(instrumental activities of daily living and MMSE scores) in
terms of linear coefficients and the 2 categorical outcome
variables (activities of daily living and self-rated poor
health) in terms of odds ratios, respectively.
In Model 1, for all outcome variables, both community-
and individual-level factors are included except for the in-
teractions of air pollution index with GDP per capita. The
associations between the air pollution index and all health
status outcome variables are highly significant even after
GDP per capita and individual characteristics are controlled.
Because all the outcome variables measure the likelihood or
level of any health problems, such positive associations in-
dicate that a higher air pollution index is associated with
a poorer health status. Specifically, a 1-point increase in the
air pollution index is associated with a 0.32 (95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 0.19, 0.45) increase in the score of in-
strumental activities of daily living, a 0.51 (95% CI: 0.27,
0.75) increase in MMSE score, a 25% (95% CI: 1.15, 1.36)
increase in the odds of having activities of daily living dif-
ficulties, and an 18% (95% CI: 1.09, 1.28) increase in
the odds of reporting poor health. The effect of GDP per
capita alone is complex. Although a higher GDP per capita
seems to be associated with better outcomes for cognitive
function and self-rated health, it is also associated with
higher likelihood of having activities of daily living diffi-
culties and has no significant effect on instrumental activi-
ties of daily living.
The interaction effects of the air pollution index with
GDP per capita are added in Model 2. Most of the interac-
tions between the air pollution index and GDP per capita are
significant and consistent. Compared with urban areas with
a low GDP per capita, urban areas with a medium GDP per
capita often demonstrate a greater effect of air pollution on
instrumental activities of daily living, MMSE, activities of
daily living, and self-rated health, and urban areas with
a high GDP per capita have an even greater effect. Specif-
ically, compared with low GDP urban areas, a 1-point in-
crease in the air pollution index is associated with an extra
0.60 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.37)
increase in instrumental activities of daily living in medium
and high GDP areas, respectively. The corresponding values
are 1.84 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.54) and 2.67 (95% CI: 1.97, 3.36)
for MMSE, respectively; 15% (95% CI: 0.89, 1.49) and 41%
(95% CI: 1.09, 1.83) for activities of daily living, respec-
tively; and 87% (95% CI: 1.43, 2.43) and 120% (95% CI:
1.68, 2.86) for self-rated health, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Unprecedented economic development coupled with
China's massive population has imposed great strain on its
environment. This study confirms for China what others
have found about the harmful effect of air pollution on in-
dividual health. The health effect of air pollution remains
significant on all the health outcome variables, including
activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily liv-
ing, cognitive impairment, and self-rated health, even after
individual characteristics and the level of community eco-
nomic development are controlled.

This study found a consistent interaction effect of air
pollution and GDP per capita at the city level on various
health outcomes. The effect of air pollution, however, is
positively, rather than negatively, related to the economic
developmental level of the community. In other words,
elderly residents living in richer cities are affected more
by air pollution than are their counterparts in poorer cities.
This is contrary to what has been documented in contem-
porary Western societies, where residents living in poorer
communities or neighborhoods are found to be more af-
fected by air pollution because of more exposure and higher
susceptibility to air pollution (13). For example, in 98 US
communities with higher unemployment rates, the effect of
exposure to ozone on mortality was also higher (33). As
another example, individuals living in lower income areas
in Ontario, Canada, were more likely to be hospitalized as
the result of gaseous air pollutants (sulfur dioxide and ni-
trogen dioxide) (34). Similarly in South Korea, the effect of
air pollution on asthma hospital visits was elevated for both
adults and children in districts with lower average health
insurance premiums (35, 36). The contradiction seems to
be related to the meaning of regional socioeconomic devel-
opment in social settings that are at different developmental
stages (12). In developed countries, higher socioeconomic
status communities are usually linked with cleaner environ-
ments and greater distance from hazardous materials. Indi-
viduals who live in these communities tend to benefit from
an array of socioeconomic advantages. In developing coun-
tries, however, economically advantaged cities or commu-
nities usually have elevated pollution and degradation of the
ecosystem.
The link among community socioeconomic status, pollu-
tion, and health in developing countries, nevertheless, is
more complex than a linear mediating model, where higher
economic development is simply assumed to bring more
pollution, which, in turn, leads to poorer individual health.
There is an absence of a linear correlation between GDP per
capita and the air pollution index among the 735 city dis-
tricts in this study: Pearson's correlation is negligible,
À0.029 (P < 0.430) (refer to Web Appendix 4 for more
details). This may be explained by the environmental
Kuznets curve hypothesis, which assumes an inverted
U-shaped relation between pollutants and income per capita
(37): In the early stage of industrialization, the rapid growth

accompanied by greater use of natural resources and emis-
sion of pollutants leads to environmental deterioration and
increased pollution. In the later stage, as income has risen
and the structure of the economy has evolved from a pollut-
ing industrial economy to a cleaner service economy, there
is a higher preference by people for environmental quality,
and the resources and technology are available to make
regulatory measures possible. Thus, pollution gradually reaches
a point from which it starts to decline. Although skepticism
exists about the robustness of this model (38), there is evi-
dence that city/regional-level environmental burdens, which
include air pollution such as sulfur dioxide, suspended par-
ticulate matters, and nitrous oxides, exhibit a similarly in-
verted U relation with income (2, 37, 39, 40).
The regional variation in China with respect to socioeco-
nomic development and environmental management, to
some degree, reflects such a pattern. Although the Chinese
central government has passed environmental laws and reg-
ulations, they are enforced by local governments, which may
set different priorities between economic development and
environmental protection and are constrained by local finan-
cial resources. Even though the more developed areas of

Air Pollution, Development, and Health 1315
Am J Epidemiol 2008;168:1311­1318
China suffered from pollution at their early stages of indus-
trialization, they have accumulated more resources that can
now be invested in environmental improvement. Pioneer
cities in environmental protection in China are those with
higher GDP per capita, such as Shanghai, Dalian, and
Guangzhou (28, 41). In contrast, cities in poorer areas, al-
though they are catching up in industrial development, still
find themselves with limited resources to cope with environ-
mental problems. Therefore, while less developed areas in
China are industrializing and experiencing unmanaged pol-
lution, the more developed areas are trying to contain or
reduce damage caused by the unchecked pollution of earlier
years. These 2 countervailing processes may have closed the
gap in air pollution between the more and the less developed
areas, which is reflected in the lack of a correlation between
regional GDP per capita and the air pollution index.
The discussion above sheds light on why higher commu-
nity socioeconomic status is not necessarily associated with
higher pollution in China. The following provides possible
explanations for why community socioeconomic status
elevates the effects of pollution, or why residents in more
developed urban areas are more vulnerable to air pollution
than are their counterparts in less developed areas.
First, in a historical perspective, this finding is consistent
with the environmental risk transition framework: Eco-
nomic development at its early stage results in increased
community health risks. Societies at this stage shift environ-
mental health risks from the household to the community in
the form of such things as urban air quality (3). As a result,
the severity of health problems continues to rise as income
increases, before it levels off at high income levels as in the
rich countries. There is historical and contemporary evi-
dence that supports this perspective: rapid economic growth
immediately causes health problems, such as disease and
death (3, 4).
Second, what matters may not be just the current level of
air pollution but also the cumulative or total exposure. The
higher effect of air pollution in more developed areas found
in this study may be attributed to respondents' higher expo-
sure at an earlier stage of economic development. The
chronic effect of air pollution has been documented in the
literature. Chronic exposure to particulate air pollution, for
example, was observed to be related to a range of cardio-
pulmonary health outcomes, including respiratory disease
and declines in lung functions (8). For some diseases, the
latency, or the length of time between exposure and effect,
can be as long as 20­30 years (6). The outcome variables
examined in this study are general health conditions, which
may be more susceptible to long-term exposure to air
pollution.
Finally, the magnitude of the effect of air pollution also
depends on residents' sensitivity (10). Residents of wealth-
ier areas in Sa
~o Paulo, Brazil, for example, had a higher
relative risk of dying from the effect of particulate matter
of less than 10 lm in diameter than did those living in more
deprived areas (42). This could be because the former are
protected from other preventable causes of death and thus
are more vulnerable or sensitive to air pollution, while the
latter, facing multiple competitive causes of death, are less
affected by air pollution alone. This could also explain the
generally larger effect of air pollution in the more developed
urban areas in China.
We found in the research literature that health outcomes
focused primarily on 3 categories: mortality, direct mea-
sures of morbidity (e.g., respiratory infection, pulmonary
functions, and bronchial responsiveness), and indirect mea-
sures of morbidity from health care utilization (e.g., hospital
and emergency room admissions). Although there are stud-
ies that link air pollution with self-rated health (33), we
found no study that directly looked at the effect of air pol-
lution on activities of daily living, instrumental activities of
daily living, or MMSE at the individual level.
Error in the measurement of exposure is a serious limitation
in many air pollution studies (10, 43). This study is no excep-
tion. Errors may come from both spatial and temporal aspects.
Because this study is based on an overall measure of air
pollution at the city level, we could not distinguish the effect
of each component of the air pollution index. When the anal-
ysis is based on large geographic units, it is unlikely to capture
pollution exposure at a more local level that has a more direct
effect on individuals (43). Further, the effect may change as
the size of study areas varies (44). In addition, we cannot
accurately assess the exposure duration. It is quite possible
that some residents had moved from one community to an-
other, obscuring the connection between pollution exposure
and health outcomes. Although the adoption of the 1995 air
pollution index was an attempt to capture the possible lagged
effect of air pollution on health status in 2002, whether it is an
accurate measure of exposure is still questionable. Finally, the
cross-sectional design of this study makes it difficult to estab-
lish explicitly the time order of causality (9, 45).
Overall, our study reveals the complexity of the interac-
tion between air pollution and community socioeconomic
status on health status. The findings suggest that caution is
warranted when generalizing from one set of social settings
to another because community socioeconomic status may
have different meanings and implications.
