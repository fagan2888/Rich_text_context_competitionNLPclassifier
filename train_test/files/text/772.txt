Explaining The Decline
In Health Insurance
Coverage, 1979­1995
Rising health spending levels over the past two decades have
created a growing pool of uninsured workers.
by Richard Kronick and Todd Gilmer
PROLOGUE: The growing number of uninsured Americans,
coupled with a fraying of the health care safety net, poses a
threat to the nation's health. Even in the best of economic
times, a substantial percentage of the U.S. population of 270
million people is uninsured, a societal problem that has yet to
fully provoke the health policy community to act. The Clinton
administration's comprehensive solution was flatly rejected;
thus, the president and Congress have returned to the politics
of incrementalism.The administration and Republicans on
Capitol Hill are expressing greater interest in encouraging the
purchase of private health insurance through tax credits, an
approach that President Bill Clinton proposed in his recent
long-term care plan. However, requiring that people purchase
coverage is an unresolved but ticklish issue for Republicans,
who fear that such an approach would be regarded as a tax
increase. Basic questions remain, though, about why health
insurance coverage has eroded over the past twenty years, and
that is the subject that Richard Kronick and Todd Gilmer
address in this paper.
Kronick, a widely respected student of health policy, is an
associate professor in the Department of Family and Preventive
Medicine at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
One of the founders of "managed competition," Kronick
served as a senior adviser in the Clinton administration, where
he contributed to the design of the administration's health care
reform proposal in the early 1990s. He earned his doctorate in
political science from the University of Rochester. Gilmer, a
health economist, is a colleague of Kronick's at UCSD. He
recently earned his doctorate from the University of
Washington.

ABSTRACT: The decline in health insurance coverage among workers from
1979 to 1995 can be accounted for almost entirely by the fact that per capita
health care spending rose much more rapidly than personal income during this
time period. We simulate health insurance coverage levels for 1996­2005
under alternative assumptions concerning the rate of growth of spending. We
conclude that reduction in spending growth creates measurable increases in
health insurance coverage for low-income workers and that the rapid increase
in health care spending over the past fifteen years has created a large pool of
low-income workers for whom health insurance is unaffordable.
From 1979 to 1995 the number and percentage of workers
without health insurance increased substantially, but the
cause of this increase is still not well understood. One poten-
tial explanation is that changes in the structure of the economy, in
immigration patterns, and in educational achievement resulted in an
increased number of low-wage workers in 1995 compared to 1979.1
This explanation is clearly not supported by the facts. Among all
workers, real income per capita in 1995 was $27,936, about 3 percent
higher than in 1979. Further, although income inequality has risen,
growth in real income between 1979 and 1995 was virtually flat for
the second through the eighth income deciles, with the bottom
decile and the top two deciles posting slight gains in real income
during 1979­1995.2 Health insurance coverage has declined substan-
tially while real income has been close to flat; we cannot explain a
variable with a constant.
A second potential explanation is that employment has shifted
toward jobs that are part time, in small firms, self-employed, non-
unionized, or in service industries, all of which tend not to have
insurance benefits. However, a growing body of research suggests
that changes in job characteristics cannot account for much of the
decline in coverage.3 The basic argument is a simple one. First, job
characteristics, other than income, have relatively small effects on
the probability of coverage. Second, the magnitude of changes in the
proportion of workers in types of jobs less likely to offer coverage
has been relatively small and therefore cannot account for much of
the aggregate decline in workers' health insurance coverage. We add
to the evidence for this argument in the results we present below.
A third potential explanation is that health insurance coverage
has declined because health care prices have increased more rapidly
than income. This explanation is intuitively plausible: Even the cas-
ual observer is aware that health care prices have increased more
rapidly than income for most of the past sixteen years. However, no
direct evidence has been assembled in support of this hypothesis.
This paper documents the extent of the decline in the percentage
of workers with health insurance between 1979 and 1995, estimates

a model in which the probability of being insured is a function of the
ratio of per capita health care expenditure to personal income as
well as other demographic and employment characteristics, and
uses this model to estimate the extent to which declining coverage
rates can be accounted for by growth in health spending relative to
income. We also use this model to simulate trends in the number of
employed uninsured persons under alternative assumptions about
health spending and income growth from 1996 to 2005.
Standard Economic Theory Of Insurance
First, we consider whether we should expect the number of unin-
sured persons to rise as the price of health services rises. Most
noneconomists assume that when premiums increase, the percent-
age of the population willing (or able) to pay will fall, and the
uninsured population will grow. Economists see a more complex
relationship.
Insurance theory posits that the desire for insurance represents
an attempt by risk-averse persons to maximize utility in the face of
uncertainty: People do not know whether they will be sick and
would rather take a certain, moderate loss by paying an insurance
premium than take the chance of financial loss from serious illness.4
A health insurance premium has two components: first, the ex-
pected cost of medical benefits, and second, the loading fee--the
cost of insurance administration, a return to the insurer to bearing
risk, and insurance company profit. Because most people are risk-
averse, and because the tax code allows wage and salary workers to
pay health insurance premiums with pretax dollars, many people
would rather pay the loading fee than risk a large out-of-pocket
payment if they are uninsured and become sick.
According to this standard theory, the price of health insurance is
not the premium, but rather the loading fee.5 The theory makes
unambiguous predictions about the relationship between the load-
ing fee and the demand for insurance: As the loading fee increases,
demand for insurance will decrease. Similarly, the standard theory
makes straightforward predictions about the relationship between
insurance coverage and marginal tax rates: As marginal tax rates
decrease, insurance coverage will decrease.
The standard theory does not, however, make clear predictions
about the relationship between the price of health care services and
the extent of insurance coverage (demand). Martin Feldstein has
argued that as the price of health care increases, the demand for
insurance should increase as well.6 He contended that increases in
the price of health care services would raise total spending for these
services (assuming that the elasticity of demand is between 0 and

­1), which would cause an increase in the risk to be insured against
and thus an increase in the demand for insurance.
We think that this standard theory misrepresents the choices
facing many persons with low incomes and few assets, who buy
insurance primarily to protect their health. Most persons with low
and moderate incomes could not possibly pay for the care they
would need if they were uninsured and became seriously ill. They
might be forced to deplete their assets and then hope to receive free
care or qualify for Medicaid or another public program. The risk to
health and future earnings for such persons can be substantial.
As the price of health care increases, persons with assets to pro-
tect will see an increased financial risk from being uninsured, and
many will find higher premiums worthwhile. However, persons
with few assets to protect will get no greater benefits from insur-
ance when health care prices are higher than when they were lower:
There is no difference in the extent of financial protection and little
difference in the amount of protection to health. As a result, we
expect fewer low-income persons to buy insurance as health care
prices increase.
Data And Methods
n Sample characteristics. We used the March Supplements to the
Current Population Survey (CPS) to measure health insurance cover-
age, earnings, and employment characteristics. Information on health
insurance is available in each year from 1980 through 1996, with the
exception of 1981; the combined sample is approximately 2.2 million
respondents. Questions on health insurance and earnings refer to the
previous year.
We restricted our analysis to adults ages nineteen to sixty-four
who worked during the previous year and did not receive health
insurance as a dependent or through a public program. We applied
this restriction for two reasons. First, we are modeling the effects of
health care prices and personal income on a person's decision to
purchase coverage. Very few workers who are covered by public
programs or as a dependent purchase coverage on their own; thus,
including these workers in the analysis may bias our estimates of the
effects of price and income on coverage decisions. Second, the CPS
questions on health insurance were changed substantially in 1988
and in 1995. The 1988 changes primarily affected coverage estimates
for children age fifteen and younger and for those covered as a de-
pendent; the 1995 changes mainly affected coverage estimates for
the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services
(CHAMPUS) and dependent coverage.7 Restricting our analysis
minimizes the effects of these question-wording changes on esti-

mates of coverage and enables us to analyze the data from the
1980­1996 surveys as a time series of cross-sections.8
We also compared coverage among this subset to coverage for the
entire population under age sixty-five. The uninsured population
(under age sixty-five) appeared to decline by three percentage
points from the 1987 survey to the 1988 survey, although a variety of
other indicators suggest that coverage rates actually changed little
between 1986 and 1987. We subtracted three percentage points from
the whole-population coverage estimates from the pre-1988 surveys
to account for question-wording changes. No adjustment was
needed for our subset of workers because question-wording
changes had minimal effects on their coverage estimates.
n Per capita health care spending. Our goal was to measure
the premium for a standardized package of health benefits for work-
ers ages nineteen to sixty-four in each year from 1979 through 1995.
Unfortunately, no nationally reliable data provide direct estimates
of this amount. Instead, we used data from the National Health
Accounts (supplied by the Office of the Actuary at the Health Care
Financing Administration), supplemented by data from the 1977
National Medical Care Expenditure Survey (NMCES), the 1987 Na-
tional Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES), and the CPS to esti-
mate the total spent on a standard benefit package for our subset of
workers in each year. We then divided by the CPS estimate of
insured adults to estimate the price of services per person.
Ideally, we would be able to estimate price changes for a standard
benefit package. However, the out-of-pocket share of total private
spending fell from 1979 to 1995, while spending covered by private
insurance rose, reflecting more complete coverage for those persons
with insurance.9 To estimate prices for a comparable benefit pack-
age over time, our expenditure variable includes both out-of-pocket
spending and spending covered by private insurance.
For each year we aggregated expenditures on the services typi-
cally included in an acute care benefits package: hospital and physi-
cian services, prescription drugs, home health services, and the net
administrative cost of insurance. Per capita expenditures were esti-
mated using three steps: (1) Data from the National Health Ac-
counts were used to compute total expenditures on these services;
(2) data from the 1977 NMCES, the 1987 NMES, and the March
Supplements to the 1980­1996 CPS were used to estimate the por-
tion of expenditures accounted for by insured persons ages nineteen
to sixty-four; and (3) data on the number of insured persons from
the CPS were divided into these expenditure estimates.10
Our key independent variable was the estimated per capita health
care spending for insured persons ages nineteen to sixty-four di-

vided by personal income (the expenditure-to-income ratio). For
each of the approximately 890,000 workers in the 1980­1996 CPS,
we divided estimated health care expenditures per capita in the year
by the respondent's personal income. All analyses used sample
weights in the CPS so that the results reflect the distribution of
income and insurance status in the U.S. population.
We estimated three logistic regressions to quantify the extent to
which changes in the expenditure-to-income ratio account for
changes in the percentage uninsured. The dependent variable in
each model is a 0­1 indicator of whether the respondent has health
insurance. In the first model the independent variables are dummy
variables for each year, so that we could estimate the association
between year or time period and the percentage uninsured. The year
indicators serve as a proxy for all variables that might have affected
the percentage uninsured. In the second model we supplemented
the year indicators with the measure of per capita expenditures
divided by each individual's personal income. In this model the pa-
rameter estimates for the year indicators are a proxy for all variables
that might have affected the percentage uninsured other than the
expenditure-to-income ratio that is included in the model.
The third model includes additional independent variables meas-
uring job characteristics such as firm size, union membership, part-
time status, and industry, as well as demographic characteristics
such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education. Because firm size
was first asked in 1988, and union membership was only asked of
about 20 percent of the sample, we used a subset of our full data to
estimate this model. We transformed the parameter estimates into
estimated percentage effects on probability of coverage.11
We used the parameter estimates from the fully specified logistic
regression to simulate coverage levels under alternative assump-
tions about the future paths of expenditure and income. Each simu-
lation used the sample of workers from the 1996 CPS who were not
covered by a public program or as a dependent and trended income
and expenditures forward at specified rates. We assumed a 2.7 per-
cent per year nominal growth rate for income, reflecting the assump-
tion in the 1997 Economic Report to the President that the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) will grow at 2.7 percent per year from 1997 to 2005
and that there will be minimal growth in real wages. We simulated
the effects of growth rates in health spending per capita for insured
workers of zero, 3.5 percent, 5.5 percent, and 7.5 percent per year. In
each simulation the population of workers remained static, as repre-
sented by the 1996 CPS sample. The simulations did not capture
changes in the labor force that will occur as the population ages, as
people enter (or leave) the labor force, or as a result of immigration.

Changes In Insurance Coverage
The percentage of uninsured workers ages nineteen to sixty-four
who are not covered as a dependent or by a public program rose
from 15.1 percent in 1979 to 23.3 percent in 1995 (Exhibit 1). The
proportion uninsured increased rapidly (an average of 0.8 percent-
age points per year) during 1979­1984 and again during 1987­1991; it
was relatively stable during 1984­1987 and during 1992­1995.
Changes in coverage among the subset of workers on whom we
focus analysis in the rest of this paper were similar to changes in
coverage for the entire population under age sixty-five (Exhibit 1).
The percentage uninsured for the population under age sixty-five
increased more slowly than among our worker subset during
1987­1995, primarily reflecting increased Medicaid coverage among
children and single mothers. The level of coverage among the subset
was consistently lower than among the under-age-sixty-five popu-
lation because we excluded those workers who were covered as a
dependent or by public programs.
n Insurance coverage and income. Changes in insurance cov-
erage among workers closely follow the pattern of changes in the
ratio of health care expenditures per capita to the median wage.
(Exhibit 2). The expenditure-to-income ratio for the median-
income worker increased from 4.5 percent in 1979 to 7.3 percent in
1995. This increase occurred because real health spending per capita

rose by 60 percent during the time period, while real median income
hardly rose at all. The expenditure-over-median-income series
tracks closely the periods of rapid growth and stability in the cover-
age series: When the series slowed its rapid growth during
1984­1987, insurance coverage was stable, and the slight decline in
the series during 1992­1995 was accompanied by a second period of
stability in coverage.
Holding real income constant, coverage has declined over the
sixteen-year time period. For example, among workers earning be-
tween $10,000 and $15,000 per year during 1979­1983 (in 1995 dol-
lars), 27 percent were uninsured; by 1992­1995, 43 percent of such
workers were uninsured. The decline in coverage, holding real in-
come constant, occurred throughout the income distribution, al-
though the largest effects are evident at low income levels.12
In contrast, when we hold constant the ratio of per capita health
expenditures to income, there is very little change in coverage over
the period (Exhibit 3). For example, among workers for whom per
capita health spending is between 5 and 10 percent of their income,
approximately 14 percent are uninsured, and this figure does not
vary much from 1979 to 1995. As the expenditure-to-income ratio
rises, the likelihood of coverage falls, but at any given expenditure-
to-income level the probability of coverage in 1992­1995 is similar to
the probability in 1979­1983.

per capita expenditures were less than 5 percent of income for about
half of all workers and more than 10 percent for about one-fifth of
workers. By 1992­1995 per capita expenditures were less than 5
percent for only 26 percent of workers, more than 10 percent for

one-third of workers. As a result of expenditure increases that were
much more rapid than wage increases, health insurance appears to
be unaffordable for many more workers in 1995 than in 1979.
Controlling for spending divided by income, there are only small
residual time-period effects on coverage levels (Exhibit 5). The
black line in Exhibit 5 shows the estimated effects of year dummy
variables from a logistic regression in which the probability of being
insured is modeled as a function of each respondent's expenditure-
to-income level.13 The estimated year effects--which serve as a proxy
for the effect of all factors other than the expenditure-to-income
variable included in the model--cluster around zero, indicating that
the eight-percentage-point rise in the percentage uninsured during
1979­1995 can be accounted for almost completely by changes in the
relative growth rates of per capita health spending and income.
During the early 1990s coverage levels appear to be somewhat
higher than expected, given our model and the behavior of spending
and incomes. During the recession of the early 1990s real income was
falling and health spending was increasing rapidly. Our model sug-
gests that the percentage uninsured should have been approxi-
mately 1.5 percentage points higher than it actually was. It appears
that workers were holding on to coverage at slightly higher levels
than our model predicts. To the extent that changes in the expendi-
ture-to-income distribution do not perfectly account for the decline
in coverage, what remains to be explained is not why so many
workers were uninsured during the early 1990s but, rather, why
even more workers did not lack coverage.

teristics. We turn now to consideration of the effects of factors

other than the expenditure-to-income ratio on the probability of
having health insurance. Exhibit 6 shows the mean values for a
variety of employment and demographic characteristics, the esti-
mated marginal effect of each on the probability of insurance cover-
age, and the estimated effect of the change in the mean of each from
1979 to 1995 on the percentage of insured workers.
The percentage of part-time workers increased by approximately
three percentage points during 1979­1995, and, controlling for other
variables in the model, part-time workers were 6.8 percentage
points less likely than full-time workers were to have health insur-
ance (Exhibit 6). Thus, the effect of a three-percentage-point in-
crease on the number of part-time workers is to decrease the per-
centage of insured workers by two-tenths of one percentage point.
Similarly, the percentage of workers in service industries increased
by 3 percent, and these workers are 5 percent less likely to have
coverage than the average worker, so the effect of increased employ-

parameter estimates were relatively small. Further, changes in some
characteristics push toward increased coverage, while others push
toward decreased coverage. For example, the percentage working
for two or more employers declined, and the percentage working in
finance increased, each of which should have increased coverage
slightly. In total, shifts in the distribution of employment charac-
teristics should have led to a 0.8 percent decline in coverage in 1979­
1995--approximately one-tenth of the eight-percentage-point decline
that occurred.
Demographic characteristics changed in counterbalancing ways.
There were fewer young workers in 1995 than in 1979 (reflecting the
aging of the baby boomers), and education levels of the labor force
rose. Each of these changes should have led to increases in health
insurance coverage. However, there also were more single workers
in 1995 than in 1979 and more black and Hispanic workers, changes
that should have led to decreased coverage. On net, changes in
demographic characteristics are expected to have little effect on
changes in coverage during 1979­1995.
In contrast, changes in the distribution of the expenditure-to-
income ratio account for most of the observed change in coverage in
1979­1995. A 10 percent increase in the expenditure-to-income ratio
results in a 1.2-percentage-point increase in the percentage unin-
sured. The median expenditure-to-income ratio increased from 4.5
percent to 7.3 percent, an increase of 62 percent. This 62 percent
increase in the expenditure-to-income ratio should have resulted in
a decrease of 7.5 percentage points in the percentage uninsured. The
increase in the ratio accounts for almost all of the 8.2-percentage-
point decline in the percentage uninsured in 1979­1995.
n Ten-year coverage simulations. We used the parameter esti-
mates from this logistic regression to simulate insurance coverage
rates over the next ten years, given alternative assumptions about
the rate of growth of health spending per capita. In each simulation
we assumed that personal income will grow at 2.7 percent per year.
In one simulation we assumed a 7.5 percent per year growth rate in
health spending per capita for our worker subset on services in-
cluded in a typical health insurance policy; in alternative scenarios
we assumed 5.5 percent, 3.5 percent, and zero growth rates.
If health spending per capita increases at 7.5 percent per year for
the next ten years, we would expect the percentage of uninsured
workers who are not covered by a public program or as a dependent
to increase from 23 percent in 1995 to 30 percent in 2005 (Exhibit 7).
Conversely, if health spending (in nominal dollars) were to remain
flat for ten years while income rises by 2.7 percent per year, the
percentage uninsured would fall to 20 percent by 2005. In the most

likely scenario--a 5.5 percent growth rate in health spending per
capita for insured workers--we expect the percentage of uninsured
workers not covered by Medicaid or as a dependent to increase to 27
percent in 2005.14
n Limitations. Although we have information on the insurance
status, income, and other employment characteristics of almost
900,000 workers over a sixteen-year period, we have only limited
information to estimate insurance premiums: one observation in
each year. This observation is not a direct measurement of the pre-
mium for a standard benefit package but, rather, an estimate, con-
structed from a variety of data sources, of health care spending per
insured worker under age sixty-five on services typically included in
a health insurance policy. Our evidence about the relationship be-
tween spending, income, and coverage would be stronger if we
could show that coverage declines were greater in areas where pre-
miums rose more quickly (relative to income). However, the lack of
reliable data makes the success of any such effort doubtful.
All of the variation in the expenditure-to-income variable within
each year is attributable to variation in income; the per capita ex-
penditure amount in each year is a constant. To a large extent, the
magnitude of the parameter estimates on the expenditure-to-
income variable is determined by the strength of the relationship
between income and insurance coverage; for example, our estimate
of the effect of moving from an expenditure-to-income ratio of 0.08
to a ratio of 0.088 is largely determined by the difference in prob-
ability of coverage for two persons with a 10 percent difference in
income. However, these estimates can be used to simulate coverage

levels under alternative assumptions about the rate of growth of per
capita spending, for two reasons: First, both common sense and the
theory we presented earlier suggest that the portion of a person's
income paid for health insurance should be systematically related to
the likelihood that this person will purchase coverage; second, the
data in Exhibit 3 provide strong evidence to support this theory.
The model we have estimated implies that the probability of cov-
erage for a worker earning $15,000 when per capita spending is
$1,500 per year will be the same as the probability of coverage for a
worker earning $20,000 when per capita spending is $2,000 per
year. The data in Exhibit 3 suggest that this assumption is a reason-
able one. It would be desirable, ideally, to have separate estimates of
the effects of per capita spending and income on the probability of
being insured; however, the limited information available on vari-
ation in per capita spending makes it impossible to directly disen-
tangle the effects of changes in spending from other factors affecting
coverage that might have changed over time. As a result, we have
adopted an indirect approach to solving the problem, analyzing the
relationship between coverage and the ratio of expenditure to in-
come. It is important to remember that although the cross-section
variation in the ratio results from variation in income, over the
1979­1995 period variation in the distribution of the expenditure-
to-income ratio is almost entirely the result of variation in spending
per capita. We have capitalized on this time-series variation to esti-
mate the relationship between changes in per capita spending and
changes in coverage.
Changes in health insurance question wording in the CPS raise
doubts about the ability to analyze the CPS data as a time series. By
restricting our analysis to adult workers not covered by a public
program or as a dependent, we have minimized the effect of
question-wording changes on the comparability of the time-series
data, but our conclusions would be stronger if the health insurance
questions had remained constant over time.
We have not explicitly accounted for changes in coverage that
might have occurred to the extent that increases in Medicaid cover-
age enacted in the late 1980s "crowded out" private insurance. As
argued by David Cutler and Jonathan Gruber, expansions of Medic-
aid eligibility in the early 1990s probably encouraged some low-
income workers (and their employers) to forgo private coverage in
"More workers were uninsured in 1995 than in 1979 because rising
health expenditures made insurance increasingly unaffordable."

favor of public coverage.15 If we had analyzed private coverage
among all workers, we would have used an analytic strategy that
estimated the effect of increased Medicaid eligibility levels on pri-
vate coverage. However, we implicitly controlled for "crowd-out" by
focusing our analysis on workers not covered by Medicaid.
Discussion And Policy Implications
We have shown that the sharp declines in insurance coverage
among workers from 1979 to 1995 can be accounted for almost en-
tirely by the fact that per capita health care spending increased
much more rapidly than income over this period. Real income per
worker in 1995 was virtually the same as in 1979. Thus, almost all of
the decline in coverage can be attributed to growth in per capita
health care spending. More workers were uninsured in 1995 than in
1979 because rising health care expenditures made insurance unaf-
fordable for a growing number of workers.
We have demonstrated this result without entering into the
theoretical and empirical tar pit of attempting to determine whether
employers or employees really pay for health insurance. The stand-
ard economic view, which we largely endorse, argues that benefits
are a form of compensation and that employers divide compensation
between cash wages and benefits in the proportion that allows them
to attract the quality and quantity of labor they desire. An employer
able to pay total compensation of $7 per hour in 1979 might have
been able to better attract workers by offering $6.40 per hour in
wages and $0.60 per hour in health benefits. That same employer,
still offering total compensation of $7 per hour (in real terms) in
1995, might be forced to spend $1 per hour for health benefits equiva-
lent to the 1979 level, but now might find a better labor supply at $7
per hour in cash rather than $6 in cash and $1 in benefits.
Declines in the number of employers that offer health benefits and
increases in workers' premium contributions can be seen as a proxi-
mate cause of declines in coverage.16 However, it is not clear why
employers' behavior should have changed, especially during a time
when real incomes had not been declining and job characteristics
had not been changing dramatically. We view changes in employers'
behavior as a phenomenon requiring explanation, rather than as an
explanation for declining coverage. We have shown that these
changes can be understood as a response to rising health care prices.
We have used our estimates of the relationship between wages,
health care prices, and insurance coverage to simulate coverage lev-
els given alternative assumptions concerning the rate of health care
spending growth over the next decade. If health spending per capita
rises 5.5 percent per year while personal income rises 2.7 percent,

our simulation forecasts that the percentage of uninsured workers
will increase by approximately 0.4 percentage points per year.
We believe that increases in the number of uninsured persons
would be an undesirable outcome. Some workers for whom health
insurance becomes unaffordable will suffer financial and health
catastrophes when they are uninsured and become sick. As public
budgets are strained and price competition in the private market
lessens the ability of providers to cross-subsidize care to the unin-
sured poor, increases in the number of uninsured will further tatter
an already frayed safety net.
These findings have two important policy implications. First, to
the extent that the growth of price competition and managed care
has led to a moderation in the rate of growth of health insurance
prices over the past few years, this has real benefits for low-wage
workers, more of whom are able to afford insurance than would
have been the case if prices had continued on their prior path of
rapid increase. This is not a new observation, but our analysis pro-
vides quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the effect and indi-
cates the primary role of price in determining insurance coverage
levels. Those who see managed care as the enemy should keep in
mind that limits on spending growth have had real benefits for
workers, not just for employers and insurance executives.
Second, our analysis reinforces the necessity for change in the
rules of health care financing if employee coverage is to expand.
Given the escalation of prices over the past twenty-five years, health
insurance appears to be unaffordable for large numbers of low- and
medium-wage workers. If, as seems likely, health spending contin-
ues to rise more rapidly than income over the next ten years, then
more workers will lack insurance, not fewer. To avoid this, new
subsidies for lower-income workers will be required, likely com-
bined with required contributions from employers and workers.

8. Our analysis focuses on the group of workers most likely to be making health
insurance purchasing decisions. This restriction may slightly limit the gener-
alizability of our findings but does not affect their validity. If we find, for
example, that health care spending increases entirely account for the decline
in coverage among our subset of workers not covered by a public program or
as a dependent, it would be theoretically possible that declines in coverage
among other workers are accounted for by different mechanisms; although
possible, however, this seems unlikely.

from their true values because of a variety of factors: Observations are not
