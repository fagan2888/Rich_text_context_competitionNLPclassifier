Background--The US Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) agenda set targets for major risk factors for coronary heart disease
(CHD). However, the potential impact of achieving those risk factor reductions on both population levels and social
disparities in CHD has not been quantified.
Methods and Results--Data on 10-year risk of CHD (from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination
Epidemiological Follow-Up study 1971 to 1982), prevalence of major CHD risk factors (from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2004), and HP2010 targets for CHD risk factors (reduction of smoking
rate to 12%, hypertension to 14%, high cholesterol levels to 17%, diabetes to 2.5%, and obesity to 15%) were used
to estimate effects of different scenarios on population levels and social disparities in CHD. Over a 10-year period,
the largest relative reductions in population levels of CHD (20.0% in men; 23.9% in women) would be achieved
if all social groups met the HP2010 targets. CHD disparities would be most reduced if the less educated (absolute
disparities reduced by 66.1% in men; 56.3% in women) and the low income group (absolute disparities reduced
by 93.7% in men; 94.3% in women) achieved the targets before the most advantaged. These reductions are larger
than those expected if targets were achieved overall for the population but relative social group differences in risk
factors remained, or under leveling-up approaches in which the least advantaged achieved the current levels of risk
factors of the most advantaged.
Conclusions--Interventions to reduce CHD risk factors to HP2010 targets that focus on all social groups would
produce the best overall scenario for both population levels and disparities in CHD. (Circ Cardiovasc Qual
Outcomes. 2009;2:598-606.)

The US Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) agenda pro-
poses that improvements in the levels of and dispari-
ties in coronary heart disease (CHD) would be achieved by
(1) reduction of the prevalence of high cholesterol levels to
17% or reduction of mean cholesterol levels to 199 mg/dL,
(2) reduction of the prevalence of hypertension to 14%, (3)
reduction of the prevalence of adult smoking to 12% and
the percentage of adult ever-smoking by 75%, (4) reduc-
tion in the prevalence of diabetes to 2.5%, and (5)
reduction of the prevalence of obesity (30 kg/m2) to
15%. All 5 targets apply equally to all social groups (sex,
race, income, and educational level)1 to reduce disparities.
However, there are still gaps between the existing and
HP2010-targeted risk factor levels.2­ 4 Although mortality
from CHD has been reduced by half since 1980, more
recent data show that this decline has slowed in younger
groups, particularly in women.5 Similarly, only small
changes have been observed in CHD risk disparities, and
the prevalence of major CHD risk factors remain highest in
the most disadvantaged socioeconomic groups.2,6
The objective of the present study was to quantify what
would happen in population-level CHD incidence and social
disparities if risk factors were modified to levels proposed by
HP2010. We created 4 hypothetical scenarios of change in
risk factors that represent different strategies of intervention
policy (Figure 1 provides an illustrative example of these
scenarios, based on smoking and education). Scenario 1 is the
ideal, where HP2010 risk factor levels are achieved in all
social groups; scenario 2 is somewhat more realistic, where
HP2010 targets are achieved overall for the population but

relative social group differences in risk factors remain at
current levels (in general the most advantaged would achieve
the goal, but all groups reduce their exposure); scenario 3 is
a deprivation focus, where only the most disadvantaged
achieve HP2010 targets; and scenario 4, in which the most
disadvantaged achieve the risk factor levels currently ob-
served among the most advantaged. This approach has been
called the leveling up strategy7 and has been suggested as the
goal to which policies to reduce health disparities should
strive because the risk in the most advantaged group can be
considered to be the best possible attainable in a particular
population. In fact, HP2010 targets are often defined on the
basis of levels observed among socially advantaged groups.1
WHAT IS KNOWN
 Although population-level changes in cholesterol,
blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity are
related to decreases in coronary heart disease (CHD)
mortality, the size of CHD reductions that would be
achieved by levels proposed by the Healthy People
2010 (HP2010) agenda is uncertain.
 Reducing major risk factors in low socioeconomic
groups would reduce absolute social disparities in
CHD by 70%, but no study has estimated the
reduction of disparities if all socioeconomic groups
achieve HP2010 targets for major CHD risk factors.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
 To obtain the maximum reduction in overall CHD
levels in the United States (by 20% in men and
23.9% in women), every educational or income
group should achieve the HP2010 targets in choles-
terol, blood pressure, smoking, and diabetes.
 To achieve the maximum reduction in CHD dispar-
ities (by 66.1% in men and 56.3% in women), the
most disadvantaged group should achieve the
HP2010 targets earlier than the most advantaged
groups.
 Universal interventions to reduce CHD risk factors
to HP2010 targets that focused on all social groups
would produce the best scenario for both population
levels and social disparities in CHD.
Methods
Rationale
To model these scenarios, we used data from the First National
Health and Nutrition Examination Epidemiological Follow-Up study
(NHEFS) (the baseline 1971/1974 and the 1982 follow-up) to
determine a risk function that represented the association between
risk factors and the 10-year absolute risk of CHD. The NHEFS was
chosen because it is the only nationally representative data that allow
the estimation of fatal and nonfatal CHD events. We then used the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003
to 2004 to determine the current distribution of major risk factors,
because NHEFS conducted from 1971 to 1974 would overestimate
the current prevalence of some risk factors and underestimate the
prevalence of diabetes and obesity. The risk function obtained from
NHEFS was then applied to the risk factor distribution observed in
NHANES 2003 to 2004 to obtain the 10-year predicted risk of CHD.
The risk of CHD in 2003 to 2004 was obtained for each social group
by including education and income separately in the risk function.
Using the CHD risk equation recalibrated to current risk factors
levels we introduced changes in the distribution of the major risk
factors to simulate the 4 hypothetical scenarios above.
Data Sources
The NHEFS is a longitudinal study of 14 407 participants aged 25 to
74 years at the time the NHANES I survey (1971 to 1974). Details
of the study have been reported elsewhere.8 We used baseline
information and data collected in the first follow-up, in 1982. CHD
incidence (fatal/nonfatal) was defined as ICD-9 codes 410 to 414 for
the discharge diagnosis on 1 or more hospital or nursing home
records, or for the primary or underlying cause of death on the death
certificate. The NHANES 2003 to 2004 was based on a national
sample of 10 122 persons in the United States aged 1 year or older.
Information on demographics and standardized laboratory tests at
baseline was used for the analysis. The sample analyzed in both
surveys was composed of blacks and whites, aged 30 to 74 years at
baseline, with complete information on risk factors, who did not
report a history of heart disease at baseline. This resulted in 3588
men and 5279 women for the NHEFS, and 1117 men and 1224
women for NHANES analysis.
Socioeconomic Position
In NHEFS and NHANES, education was categorized into less than
high school (low education), high school graduate (middle educa-
tion), and some college, college graduate, or higher (high education).
In NHEFS, total family income was recorded in 12 categories from
less than $1000 to $25 000 and more, and in NHANES 2003 in 11
categories, from $0 to $75 000 and over. To make the 2 surveys
comparable, tertiles of income were calculated as follows: low
($0­$5999), middle ($6000­$14 999), and high ($15 000) in
NHEFS and low (less than $25 000), middle ($25 000­$54 999) and
high ($55 000) in NHANES 2003 to 2004.
Measurement of CHD Risk Factors
Diabetes was analyzed as a dichotomous variable. Participants
examined at baseline in NHEFS were considered to have diabetes if
they answered affirmatively to the question "Has a doctor ever told
you that you have diabetes?" in the 1971 to 1974 detailed sample or
if they answered "yes" to both of the following questions: "Do you
have any reason to think you have diabetes, sometimes called sugar
diabetes or sugar disease? Did a doctor say you have it?" For
NHANES 2003 to 2004, respondents were considered to have
diabetes if they answered affirmatively to the question "Has a doctor
ever told you that you have diabetes?" or had a fasting glucose test
equal or greater than 126 mg/d. Respondents' "blood pressure" was
classified categorically according to their systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) recorded at baseline in
both surveys9: 119/79 mm Hg (optimal), 120 to 129/80 to
84 mm Hg (normal), 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg (high normal), 140
to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg (hypertensive stage I), 160/100 mm Hg
(hypertensive stage II). "Smoking" was derived from questions in the
follow-up interview on lifetime smoking history. For NHANES 2003
to 2004 the 3 questions on current, ever, and never consumption were
used. "Total cholesterol levels" (mg/dL) were obtained in both
surveys following standard Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion procedures,9 and classified as: 160 mg/dL (optimal), 160 to
199 mg/dL (normal), 200 to 239 mg/dL (high normal), 240 to 279
mg/dL (high), 280 mg/dL (very high). Weight and height were
measured following standard protocols, and "body mass index"
(BMI) was calculated as kg/m2.
Analysis
Our analysis was done in 7 steps (see Figure 2 for a detailed analytic
flow chart). Once the NHEFS and NHANES databases were com-
parable in regard to age, sex, ethnicity, information on risk factors

and CHD history (step 1), we assessed the risk of CHD in NHEFS
using 2 sex-specific Cox survival models, 1 using education and
another using income as the measure of socioeconomic position (step
2). We included the 5 major risk factors (diabetes, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, smoking, total cholesterol, and BMI) as
reported,10,11 but without including high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
because it was not measured in the NHEFS. Fitting the best model
was preceded by analysis of proportionality and by testing 2-order
interactions between all major risk factors, and between each risk
factor and age.12 No interactions were found to be significant, and
proportionality was fulfilled for all variables. The accuracy of the
model was quantified with the use of the C statistic (which estimates
the model's ability to discriminate between those who had and did
not have events) and with a nonparametric reliability curve to
calibrate the model (the degree of agreement between the observed
and predicted CHD cases).12 The C statistic for men and women was
0.75 and 0.82 for the model using education, and was similar when
using income. Graphical results of the accuracy of the models and
Cox coefficients are presented in the supplemental file. Then, the
10-year risk of CHD in NHANES 2003 to 2004 was calculated
following the Framingham recalibration approach11 (step 3) and
using the current distribution of risk factors, separately for education
and income (see supplemental materials for details). A CHD risk was
then obtained for each educational and income group (step 4). The
next step consisted of using the recalibrated equation, but now
introducing the changes in risk factor distribution according to the 4
scenarios (step 5). The distributions of risk factors for the hypothet-
ical scenarios are presented in supplemental Tables I and II. Then,
the predicted CHD risk was obtained for each educational and
income group for each of the hypothetical scenarios (step 6). Finally,
the predicted risk obtained under the current (NHANES) distribution
of risk factors and under hypothetical changes for each of the
scenarios was used to calculate the measures of overall and health
equity impact (step 7). To examine the effects on population levels
of CHD, we calculated (1) the predicted risk in NHANES 2003 to
2004 and (2) the percentage reduction in overall CHD risk. To
examine the effects on disparities in CHD we calculated 4 indicators:
(1) the risk ratio between (RR) between socioeconomic groups,
which measures relative disparities, (2) the absolute risk difference
(AR) between socioeconomic groups, (3) the percent reduction in
disparities in relative terms or "relative disparity reduction" (RDR),
and (4) the percent "absolute disparity reduction" (ADR). Details of
calculations are presented in the supplemental materials.
Sensitivity Analyses
All analyses were repeated using binary logistic regression and
parametric survival models, and including risk factors as continuous
rather than categorical variables, and testing for nonlinearity of the
effects. No substantive differences were observed regarding perfor-
mance statistics, so we present results of the Cox model described
above. Additionally, the complexity of the survey sample in NHEFS
was taken into consideration in our analysis by including sampling
weights in our analysis8; weighting did not change the estimation of
the associations so we present unweighted analysis. Because of a

smoking is 12%. In the scenarios on the left, smoking in the whole population is reduced, but a gradient in current smoking remains in
scenario 2. In the scenarios on the right, disparities in the less educated are reduced to the level of the HP2010 target (scenario 3), or
to the level of the most educated (scenario 4).

possible underestimation of the association of risk factors and CHD
attributable to measurement error, attenuation by reverse causation, and
short latency effects13 as well as to high sample variation attributable to
small numbers of cases, we repeated our analysis (1) using the lower and
upper 95% confidence intervals of the Cox regression coefficients of
NHEFS (for all CHD risk factors) and (2) using the Cox regression
coefficients obtained in the Framingham cohort.10 These sensitivity
analyses provided one indication of the "best and worst case" situation
given potential measurement error.
Results
Over a mean follow-up of 8.6 years in the NHEFS study, 486
incident cases of CHD were observed in women and 562 in
men. Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and ever
or current smoking were all significantly associated with
CHD. In NHANES 2003 to 2004 respondents, the reported
prevalence of CHD risk factors in women was 7% for
diabetes, 24% for smoking, 16.7% for high blood pressure,
19.3% for high cholesterol levels, and 35.5% for obesity. The
respective figure for men were 8%, 28.5%, 18%, 19.7%, and
33.8%. Neither women nor men with 12 or fewer years of
education or with low income achieved HP2010 goals for any
of the CHD risk factors, whereas those in the highest
educational category and those in the high income group were
close to achieving the HP2010 goals for cholesterol and blood
pressure (see supplemental materials).
Table 1 presents the estimates for reduction of population
levels of CHD for women and men 50 years of age in
NHANES 2003 to 2004. Under the current distribution of risk
factors, the overall risk at 10 years will be 10.4% in men and
3.5% in women. The lowest achievable population risk (8.4%
in men and 2.7% in women) will be obtained under scenario
1, if all social groups meet the HP2010 targets; these figure
are similar to the estimates obtained under scenario 2, where
the overall population achieves the targets but relative social
differences in risk factors remain. In both scenario 3, in which
only the most disadvantaged achieve the risk factor targets,
and scenario 4, in which the most disadvantaged achieve the
same levels of risk factors as the most advantaged, the
population risk would be reduced by a smaller amount.
Table 2 presents the estimates for disparity reduction by
education. The greatest reduction in disparities (either in
relative or absolute terms) would be obtained under scenario
3, where only the most disadvantaged achieve the targets.
Scenario 3 would reduce the absolute risk difference in the
least educated by 66.1% in men and by 56.3% in women, and
reverse the disparity between the middle educated and the
most educated in women and men (see supplemental Table
IV). Scenario 2, which shows change in the population levels
of risk factors without eliminating the social gradient, pro-

duces the smallest reduction in relative and absolute dispar-
ities between the least and most educated. Scenario 4--the
"leveling up" strategy--results in similarly small reductions
of absolute disparities as in scenario 2. Because scenarios 3
and 4 do not alter the risk in the most advantaged group, they
lead to the same percentage reductions in both absolute and
relative disparity.14 In contrast, in scenarios 1 and 2, where
changes occur in the most advantaged, reduction of dispari-
ties in relative terms is smaller than that for absolute
disparities.
Table 3 presents the results for reduction in disparities by
income. The ranking of the scenarios according to reduction
of disparities are the same as those observed for education:
the greatest reduction in disparities is observed in scenario 3
and the lowest reduction in scenario 2. However, a greater
reduction in disparities in absolute and relative terms is
observed for scenarios targeting the lowest income group
than what is observed for education. For instance, under
scenario 3 the reduction in both relative and absolute income
disparities was 93.7% in men and 94.3% in women; for
scenario 4, absolute and relative reductions are by 43.3% in
men and 51.0% in women.
Figure 3A (education) and 3B (income) summarizes the
potential balance between reducing the burden of CHD in the
whole population and the reduction of disparities in CHD. As
mentioned above, scenarios 1 and 2, which seek to reduce
risk factors across the whole population, would cause greater
reductions in the population's overall risk of CHD than
scenarios that focus on the disadvantaged. Scenario 3, in
which only the most disadvantaged achieve the targets,
results in the largest percentage reduction in social disparities,
for income and education, and for women and men. The
scenario that focuses on having the most disadvantaged group
achieve the current risk factor levels of the most advantaged
(scenario 4) is not better than scenario 3 in reduction of
disparities, and it is the worst scenario for reducing overall
population levels of CHD.
Sensitivity Analysis
The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Figures
1 and 2 in the supplemental file. Using Framingham esti-
mates, the results consistently show that scenarios 1 and 2
give the best reductions in population levels of CHD (Figure
1) and that scenario 3 give the best reductions for disparities
(Figure 2); the ranking of the scenarios is almost the same as
that obtained with NHEFS estimates.
Discussion
Evidence consistently shows that population-level changes in
the major CHD risk factors--high cholesterol, high blood

pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity--are related to
decreases in CHD mortality,15,16 and that reducing major risk
factors in low socioeconomic groups would reduce absolute
social disparities in CHD by 70%.17­19 Our analyses have
shown that if progress is made toward reaching the HP2010
targets for major risk factors, policy makers may assume with
some level of certainty that absolute reductions in CHD and
disparities in CHD will be achieved. We found that the most
effective reductions in overall CHD levels (20.0% in men and
23.9% in women) would be achieved under the ideal scenario
1, where every educational or income group achieved the
targets. On the other hand, the maximum reduction in CHD
disparities (in education and income) would, not surprisingly,
occur under scenario 3--the "deprivation focused" ap-
proach--where the most disadvantaged group achieved the
HP2010 targets earlier than the most advantaged. Unfortu-
nately, according to current evidence,20,21 none of the HP2010
targets could be achievable by 2010 for the whole population,
and this is even less likely in the most disadvantaged groups.
Universal strategies that attempt to equalize risk factors at
favorable levels (scenario 1) or reduce risk factors propor-
tionally across social groups (scenario 2) produce better
scenarios in terms of reducing average population levels of
CHD risk. This occurs through a reduction in risk factor
levels and consequently 10-year absolute risk in all groups,
and a reduction of risk among women and men in the highest
educational category, who constituted 60% of the population.
Proportional improvements in risk factors (scenario 2) may
be the most likely result of population policies to reduce CHD
risk (salt content, fat content, labels, cigarette taxes, etc).
Strategies that address modification of risk factors at the
population level are advocated as complementary strategies
to individual-level high-risk strategies to prevent CHD cas-
es.22,23 Data from the United States confirm that smoking
reductions of 5% in 7 years in New York, and of 8% in 2
years in California have been achieved with population
policies such as cigarette tax policies, antismoking cam-
paigns, and smoke-free indoor air policies.21,24 In New York,
an 8% reduction in hospital admissions for myocardial
infarctions has been attributed to smoking bans.25 Mean
cholesterol reductions of 6% (13 mg/dL) and high systolic
blood pressure reductions of 4% (5.1 mm Hg) have been
achieved in the United States in the last 20 years, a result of
pharmacological and lifestyle modifications, and these reduc-
tions have contributed 44% to the reduction in CHD mortality.16
Achieving the targets in the overall population without
changing relative social disparities in risk factors (scenario 2)
will have less impact on decreasing disparities (both absolute
and relative) than the scenario where targets are achieved in
all social groups or the "deprivation focused" approach.
Under scenario 2, we purposely did not change the proportion
of exposure to risk factors in each social group to more
realistically simulate the likely effects of population level
interventions. This is because population-based strategies to
reduce risk factors appear to benefit the more advantaged
groups as people in higher social positions tend to adapt
better to new situations and derive benefits faster than the
more disadvantaged.26­28 For instance, folic acid fortification
has been shown to have a differential impact on folic acid
levels and widening disparities have been observed.26,29

Similarly, some occupational antismoking policies appear to
favor higher occupational groups.30 Although it is possible
that certain structural policies, such as increased cost of
cigarettes, may benefit more disadvantaged social groups,30,31
the effects of other structural policies (eg, reduction of salt
content) or information-based approaches (eg, nutrition label-
ing) on the differential reduction of other major risk factors
has not been established.
As demonstrated in previous observational studies, equal-
izing risk factors to desirable target levels among social
groups produces an important effect in reducing absolute
CHD disparities, and our estimates are very close to those
obtained in recent analyses from populations in Finland and
the UK.17,19 However, strategies that aim to equalize risk
profiles of the less educated with those of the more highly
educated--so called "leveling up" approaches7--appear not
to produce optimal results in reducing population-level CHD
incidence. One explanation is that in the United States, the
population risk factor profile of even the most highly edu-
cated group is not ideal; as such, small changes in CHD risk
would be expected in the least advantaged groups. Even the
highly educated group still remains far from HP2010 targets;
their current prevalence for smoking is 18%, for diabetes
4.7%, and for obesity 35%.
The leveling up equity strategies assume decreasing dis-
parities by improving the health of the disadvantaged without
worsening the health of the better off, and may appear more
feasible because it is known that the advantaged groups of the
population have been able to achieve these levels.7 For
instance, in the United States, there is evidence of decreased
disparities in high blood pressure since 1971.6 Greater access
to primary preventive strategies and awareness and control of
hypertension among the most socially disadvantaged, with
lesser but important improvements observed among the most
advantaged, could be responsible for that decline. However,
when the risk factor profiles of the advantaged are not ideal,
this will not produce a better outcome for reducing absolute
disparities than reducing risk factor levels in the whole
population (scenario 2). Thus, reduction in levels of risk
factors in all social groups is likely the best approach to
achieve both overall reduction and disparities reduction.
Nevertheless, if the most disadvantaged were able to achieve
the targets before or at faster rate than the most advantaged,
even greater reductions in disparities would occur.
Although previous studies of policy effects have not
specifically addressed CHD, they may be useful to under-
stand the plausibility of the scenario where improvements
happen faster among the disadvantaged. Among minorities
and impoverished social groups, policies that increase access
to health care were observed to reduce infant mortality32 and
premature death33 between the 1960s and the 1980s in the
United States (because of greater benefits in those popula-
tions). Enhancing primary care practices have also reduced
social disparities in rates of immunization, where greater
changes in immunization rates were observed among
blacks.34 scenario 3 would represent the expected effect of
some preventive strategies already in place in the United
States that aim to decrease prevalence of major risk factor
levels among the least educated, the poorest, or among racial
minorities, faster than in more advantaged groups (ie, the
REACH 2010 and the WISEWOMAN35,36).
Our findings support the importance of continued monitor-
ing of both absolute and relative disparities. The high abso-
lute changes in disparity observed here reveal that the burden
of CHD is still high in all social groups, and monitoring
absolute disparities would be fundamental to capture the
reduction of CHD burden in all social groups. Relative
disparity reductions remain important for social gradients and
should continue to be monitored to capture any increase in the
unequal social distribution of risk factors. Potentially mitigat-
ing some of the concerns about increasing relative disparity,37
we found that reducing overall levels of risk in the popula-
tion, as in the case of scenario 2, did not increase relative
disparities, but produced only small relative and absolute
disparity reductions. An increase in relative disparities given
an overall decline in risk is not an immutable outcome, but
depends on the social context and the existence of policies or
programs that guarantee that the health of the least advan-
taged does not worsen.33
Limitations
The biggest limitation of our study is that the scenarios tested
here relate only to changes in levels of risk factors and do not
directly map onto known interventions that could achieve
such changes, and the "causal effects" of our hypothetical
interventions are difficult to establish without direct linkage
to real interventions.19,38 Our model assumes that the popu-
lation is stable in time, and that people will remain in the
same category of exposures for as long as 10 years (which is
plausible for education). These assumptions apply to any
analysis of mediation of social disparities in CHD risk, but
including such uncertainties requires more sophisticated
modeling techniques (see for instance reference39) that incor-
porate levels of adherence to preventive strategies, changes in
the social determinants (income and education), or inclusion
of other CHD predictors. However, although these uncertain-
ties may affect the magnitude of reductions under the differ-
ent scenarios (as shown in the sensitivity analyses), we expect
that they would likely result in the same ranking of the
preventive scenarios.
Our study was based on a risk model that included the
following aspects: fatal and nonfatal CHD events, a relative
risk calculated from a representative sample of white and
black people, and the risk factor distribution of a similar but
more recent sample.40 Modeling of effects of preventive
strategies on overall CHD risk and disparities have used data
from different sources15,16,19 because the data necessary to
conduct modeling is not available in one dataset. We have
made use of the best available evidence (Framingham risk
predictive factors) and of the only available national data of
measured risk factors in the United States (NHEFS,
NHANES). Inaccuracy and possible overestimation of abso-
lute risk prediction models41 may limit the interpretation of
the absolute risk as a "real risk" in the population but not the
comparative interpretation of results across interventions that
are all subject to the same limitations. In addition, our results
might not be applicable to Hispanic and other ethnic groups,
which were excluded from the analysis because of small

numbers (n159) in NHEFS. We did not calculate a different
equation for each social group, even though somewhat higher
associations between risk factors and CHD have been re-
ported in more disadvantaged social groups in some studies.40
However, interactions between education and each of the risk
factors were tested, and none were significant. Finally, we
used self-reported prevalence of diabetes to calculate the risk
of CHD in NHEFS because of lack of information on glucose
levels. We have estimated that a possible underestimation of
the effect of diabetes on CHD may have occurred. If
sensitivity of self-reported diabetes was 73% and specificity
was 99.3%,42 the relative risk of diabetes related to CHD
(unadjusted) would have been 5.45 instead of 3.99 in women
and 2.33 instead of 1.95 in men.
Implications
Our results suggest strategic directions to pursue and some of
the likely benefits to overall levels and social disparities in
CHD. Future research could use the scenario framework
suggested here to model the effects of actual interventions at
the population level. Such research is beginning to appear in
the public health and epidemiological literature and should be
encouraged.43­45
If future policy and programs in the United States continue
to focus on major risk factors to reduce population levels and
disparities in CHD--as they should--then such policies
should be mainly centered on universal approaches to reduc-
ing the main CHD risk factors in all social groups, promoting
the right to better cardiovascular health for all. A rational
portfolio of approaches would include: (1) Developmental
strategies that focus on getting younger cohorts to middle-age
without developing the major risk factors46; (2) Population
level strategies that attempt to reduce mean levels of the
major risk factors in the middle-aged population; and (3)
Targeted strategies to reduce risk factors in those over
middle-age with elevated levels through medications and
lifestyle interventions.43 Any consideration of these 3 ap-
proaches should also take into account that in population
approaches for risk factor reduction, regulatory and structural
policies (increase in prices, smoking bans)30,47 might be more
effective in narrowing disparities than information-based
approaches (antismoking adverts, nutritional labeling); that
any approach should be more intense in the most disadvan-
taged groups, so as to help them achieve targets faster; and
that special effort should be made to start appropriate inter-
ventions early in life48 to reduce the exposure of younger
populations to the risk factors.
Although community experiments aiming to reduce the
main risk factors have only had small impacts on CHD
morbidity and mortality,49 national trends have clearly shown
that primary preventive strategies to reduce major risk factor
levels in the population as well as access to medications have
resulted in a reduction in CHD rates in the United States.15
Reducing levels of traditional risk factors is the right strategy to
reduce overall population levels and social disparities in CHD.

Would Achieving Healthy-People 2010's Targets Reduce Both
Population Levels and Social Disparities in Heart Disease?
1) SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS
a) Recalibration method: We calculate P (absolute risk at 10 years) in NHANES 2003-
2004 as follows. P= 1-S(t)risk score; where S(t) risk score represents the survival function at 10
years for a population with a given distribution of risk factors. The risk score was
calculated as: e(fx,m); where F (x, M) = B1
(x1
-M1
) + B2
(x2
-M2
)...Bp
(xp
-Mp
); B1
, B2
...Bp
are the Cox regression coefficients from NHEFS, x1
, x2
..xp
represent the distribution of
risk factors under the hypothetical scenarios of changes in risk factors (calculated for
each educational and income group separately), and M1
, M2
..Mp
are the current mean
values of the risk factors in NHANES 2003-2004 (in the whole population). The S(t) was
obtained from the average incidence of CHD events (fatal and non fatal) in the
Framingham Offspring Cohort, and was 0.97 in women and 0.91 in men 13.
b) Details on measures of impact: The effects of hypothetical scenarios on population
levels of CHD: (1) the predicted risk in NHANES 2003-2004 were Pa
and Pb
; where: Pa
=
risk in the whole population under the current distribution of risk factors and Pb
= risk in
the whole population under the different scenarios, and (2) the percentage reduction in
overall CHD risk: (Pa
-Pb
)/Pa
* 100. The effects of hypothetical scenarios on disparities in
CHD : (1) measure of relative disparities (RR): Plow
/ Phigh
and Pmed
/ Phigh
where Plow
,
Pmed,
Phigh
correspond to the risk in the low, middle and high educated/income groups,
respectively; (2) measure of absolute disparities : Plow
­ Phigh
and Pmed
­ Phigh
; (3) the
percent reduction in disparities in relative terms or "relative disparity reduction" (RDR):
(Plow
/Phigh
)b
- (Plow
/Phigh
)a
/(Plow
/Phigh
- 1)a
* 100; where subscript "a" represented the
relative risk under current distribution of risk factors; and subscript "b" the relative risk
under each of the scenarios; and (4) the percentage of absolute disparity reduction
(ADR): (Plow
­ Phigh
)a
- (Plow
­ Phigh
)b
/(Plow
­ Phigh
)a
* 100.
