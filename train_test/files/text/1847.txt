Prevalence, Awareness, Treatment, and Control of
Hypertension Among United States Adults 1999­2004

Abstract--Detection of hypertension and blood pressure control are critically important for reducing the risk of heart
attacks and strokes. We analyzed the trends in the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in the
United States in the period 1999­2004. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2004
database. Blood pressure information on 14 653 individuals (4749 in 1999­2000, 5032 in 2001­2002, and 4872 in
2003­2004) aged 18 years was used. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or taking
antihypertensive medications. The prevalence of hypertension in 2003­2004 was 7.30.9%, 32.62.0%, and
66.31.8% in the 18 to 39, 40 to 59, and 60 age groups, respectively. The overall prevalence was 29.3%. When
compared with 1999­2000, there were nonsignificant increases in the overall prevalence, awareness, and treatment rates
of hypertension. The blood pressure control rate was 29.22.3% in 1999­2000 and 36.82.3% in 2003­2004. The
age-adjusted increase in control rate was 8.1% (95% CI: 2.4 to 13.8%; P0.006). The control rates increased
significantly in both sexes, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Among the 60 age group, the awareness,
treatment, and control rates of hypertension had all increased significantly (P0.01). The improvement in blood
pressure control is encouraging, although the prevalence of hypertension has not declined. (Hypertension. 2007;
49:69-75.)
Key Words: hypertension  United States  prevalence  awareness  control
Hypertension affects 65 million adult Americans1 and is
a major risk factor for myocardial infarction, stroke,
heart failure, and renal failure. The control of blood pressure
(BP) is crucial in the prevention of these adverse outcomes.
However, hypertension can be asymptomatic, so many people
with hypertension do not see a doctor. The detection and
control of BP is, thus, a major public health challenge in the
United States. The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES)2 is a large health and nutritional
survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the
United States and is very useful for monitoring trends in the
health status of the population that arise as a result of public
health measures or changes in clinical practice. In NHANES
1999­2000, 28.7% of people had hypertension. A total of
68.9% of people with hypertension were aware of the
diagnosis, 58.4% received treatment, and only in 31.0% was
the BP controlled.3 We reported previously a nonsignificant
trend of improvement in the BP control rate among people
with hypertension in the period 1999­2002.4 Moreover, the
BP goal for hypertensive patients with diabetes has changed
from 130/85 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg.5 Data from the
NHANES study conducted in 2003­2004 have recently
become available. Here, we analyzed the trends in the
prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension
in the United States in the period 1999­2004 to ascertain
whether there are further improvements in hypertension
control according to the current treatment goals.
Methods
NHANES was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.2 A stratified,
multistage probability sampling design was used in the survey. The
detailed measurement procedures and protocols have been described
in previous publications and also on its website.6­8 Since 1999,
NHANES has become a continuous survey program. The 1999­
2004 results are available online. All of the participants gave
informed consent, and the study received approval from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention Institutional Review Board.
BP was measured 3 or 4 times manually by a trained operator
using a mercury sphygmomanometer according to a standard proto-
col and calculated as the average after excluding the first measure-
ment.9 The BP measurement techniques were identical over the 3
periods (1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004). Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in meters. Individuals aged 18 years were included in the
analysis (n17 061). Participants who were interviewed but not
examined were excluded from analysis (n1190). Those with
missing data on BP or BMI were also excluded (n1218).
Hypertension was defined as an average BP 140/90 mm Hg or if
the participant was taking antihypertensive medications. The same
BP criteria applied to diabetic participants. Participants who had
been diagnosed to have hypertension were considered to be aware of
their hypertension. Participants were considered to be treated if they
were taking antihypertensive drugs. Hypertension was considered

controlled in those on treatment if the average BP was 140/
90 mm Hg in nondiabetic patients. Participants were considered to
have diabetes if it had been diagnosed previously by a doctor or if
they were receiving insulin or oral diabetic medications. For diabetic
participants, hypertension was considered to be controlled if the
average BP was 130/80 mm Hg.5
Data were analyzed using the complex sample function of SPSS
(version 13.0). Sampling errors were estimated using the primary
sampling units and strata provided in the data set. Sampling weights
were used to adjust for nonresponse bias and the oversampling of
blacks, Mexican Americans, and the elderly in NHANES. The
prevalence of hypertension, as well as the awareness, treatment, and
control rates, were age adjusted by direct standardization to the US
2000 standard population.10 To analyze differences over time, the
2003­2004 data were compared with the 1999­2000 data. Estimates
with a coefficient of variation 0.3 were considered unreliable. A
2-tailed P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
In this analysis, data on 14 653 individuals (4749 in 1999­
2000, 5032 in 2001­2002, and 4872 in 2003­2004) were
included. Table 1 shows the age, race/ethnicity, BMI, BP, and
diabetic status of the US population estimated from
NHANES 1999­2004. There was no overall significant
difference in the mean age between 1999­2000 and 2003­
2004. However, in 2003­2004, there were fewer people in the
18 to 39 age group and more people in the 40 to 59 age group.
In 2003­2004, fewer US adults had not completed high
school. There was a trend of decreasing BP levels, especially
in the elderly. Among the 60 age group, the mean systolic
and diastolic BPs had decreased significantly (P0.006 and
0.003, respectively). It is interesting that weight and BMI did
not increase significantly from 1999­2000 to 2003­2004.
However, the waist circumference had increased, from
94.950.64 cm (37.40.3 in) in 1999­2000 to 95.430.34
cm (37.60.1 in) in 2001­2002 to 96.740.35 cm (38.10.1
in) in 2003­2004 (P0.014).
Table 2 shows the prevalence of hypertension in the United
States. There was no significant change in the prevalence of
hypertension, even in different age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
BMI groups (P0.05). The prevalence of hypertension was
also analyzed by sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI in 18 to 39, 40
to 59, and 60 age groups, but the age-specific changes in
sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI were not significant. In all 3 of
the periods, the prevalence of hypertension increased with
increasing age and BMI (P0.001) but did not vary signifi-
cantly with sex. Non-Hispanic blacks had the highest preva-

lence. To measure the independent association of these
variables and education with hypertension, a multiple logistic
regression using the data from NHANES 2003­2004 was
performed with hypertension as the dependent variable.
Increasing age, increasing BMI, being non-Hispanic black,
and having less education were significantly associated with
hypertension, whereas sex was not (Table 3).
Table 4 shows the rates of awareness, treatment, and BP
control. In 2003­2004, 75.72.1% of people with hyperten-
sion were aware of their diagnosis, 65.12.4% were treated,
and 36.82.3% had BP controlled (56.62.4% among those
treated). The age-adjusted awareness and treatment rates
increased but not significantly since 1999­2000. There was
also a nonsignificant increase in the control rate among
treated hypertensive people. The proportion of treated hyper-
tensive people with diabetes reaching the contemporary target
of 130/80 mm Hg increased, although this was not statisti-
cally significant after age adjustment. However, the BP
control rate among all people with hypertension increased
significantly from 29.22.3% in 1999­2000 to 36.82.3%
in 2003­2004 (P0.02 and after age adjustment, P0.006).
The increase in age-adjusted BP control rate in this 6-year
period was 8.1% (95% CI: 2.4 to 13.8%) in absolute terms.
The Figure shows the age-specific prevalence of hyperten-
sion and BP control rates in different racial/ethnic groups. It
shows the marked increase in the prevalence of hypertension
with age and the significantly higher prevalence of hyperten-
sion in non-Hispanic blacks. The control rates were the
lowest in middle-aged Mexican American women (27.8%)
among all of the hypertensive people and in old non-Hispanic
black women (39.8%) among those treated.
Table 5 shows the effects of sex and race/ethnicity on the
awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. Between
1999 and 2004, there were no significant changes in the
awareness and treatment rates of hypertension by sex and
race/ethnicity. There was also no significant change in the
control rate among treated hypertensive people by sex and
race/ethnicity. However, the control rate among all of the
hypertensive people increased in both men and women
(P0.03 and 0.05, respectively). It improved significantly in
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans (P0.02 and

Discussion
The NHANES database has been valuable for the study of the
trends in the health status of a population because of its large
sample size, complex sampling design, good quality control,
and comprehensive content.2 It has been used to study the
prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension
in the United States.3,4,11­15 The data for 2003­2004 have just
been released, and our analysis confirms previous observa-
tions and extends previous conclusions. The prevalence of
hypertension has not increased significantly since 1999. At
the same time, there has been increasing control rate of
hypertension, especially in Mexican American men, elderly,
and obese people. The lack of increased prevalence of
hypertension may be because of the lack of a further increase
in BMI in the population, although there was an increase in
waist circumference. Better publicity and education and effort
from health professionals may be another reason for this. The
increase in BP control rates may be the result of clinical
guidelines on the management of hypertension5 rather than
improved antihypertensive drugs, because there were no new
major antihypertensive drugs introduced in this period. Public
health measures and intensified antihypertensive treatment
seem to be effective in improving BP control rates. The latest
hypertension management guidelines recommended the use
of diuretics as first-line antihypertensive medications for
uncomplicated hypertension and the use of multiple antihy-
pertensive drugs to control BP.5,16 A recent report revealed an
increase in the use of antihypertensive medications in men
from NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES 1999­
2002.17 Moreover, there was increasing use of angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor among hypertensive patients
with diabetes, congestive heart failure, and heart attack.17
This was consistent with current guidelines.5,16 The use of
diuretics also increased shortly after the release of new
evidence on the clinical equivalence of diuretics to calcium
channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors in December 2002.18,19 In recent years, it is recognized
that most hypertensive patients require multiple antihyperten-
sive drugs to control BP.20­23 The readiness to use multiple
drugs may explain the increase in BP control rates in
1999­2004.
The awareness and control rates of hypertension were
better in older people and people with higher BMI, whereas
there was relative undertreatment of hypertensive people of
younger age and lower BMI. This may be because of greater
concerns in health status among older and obese people. The
significant increase in waist circumference but not weight and
BMI suggests an increasing trend of abdominal obesity. In
fact, a detailed study of obesity in NHANES 1999­2004
revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity
among men but not women.24
Large clinical trials in hypertensive patients showed that
BP reduction is crucial in reducing adverse cardiovascular

outcomes.25­28 A small reduction in BP could reduce the risk
of heart failure, stroke, and myocardial infarction marked-
ly.5,29 The increased control rates and decreased mean BPs,
especially among the elderly, may help to decrease the
incidence of strokes and heart attacks, which is highly
encouraging. Clinicians need to overcome clinical inertia and
step up treatment to reach the BP target. Other than antihy-
pertensive medication, lifestyle interventions should also be
encouraged in hypertensive patients.30
According to the national goal of Healthy People 2010, the
proportion of adults with high BP should be reduced to 16%,
and the proportion of adults with high BP whose BP is under
control should be reduced to 50%.31 It seems unlikely,
because of the aging population, that the proportion of adults
with hypertension can be reduced to 16%. However, the
improvement in BP control rates in the last few years is
highly encouraging, suggesting that, with concerted effort
from health professionals and the government agencies, the
target of 50% BP control rate may be reached by 2010.
Recent clinical trials showed that a high BP control rate of
66% to 71% could be achieved in some settings and environ-
ments.22,23,32,33 Although we did not find a significant in-
crease in the age-adjusted rate of BP control in patients under
treatment, the age-adjusted rate was 63.9% in 2003­2004,
close to the control rates of 70% to 80% found in clinical
trials.22,23,32,33 The increase in age-adjusted control rates
among treated hypertensive patients with diabetes from
15.7% to 33.2% is promising although not statistically sig-
nificant, but this is still in need of substantial improvement. In
2003­2004, approximately one third of hypertensive patients
were unaware of their hypertension, and our efforts to detect
hypertension need to be improved. The treatment rate among
hypertensive patients was only 53.7%. Therefore, approxi-
mately half of the hypertensive subjects were not being
treated. To meet Healthy People 2010, the greatest attention
must be paid to this group. In countries with limited resources
like Cuba, very good BP control can be achieved through
investment in the training of health professionals, availability
of locally manufactured drugs, and more aggressive policy at
the primary care level.34 Therefore, there is room for further
improvement in the control of hypertension in the United
States.
Studies using a BP goal of 140/90 mm Hg in hyperten-
sive people with diabetes might overestimate BP control
rates.1,3,4,13­15,35 Therefore, in this study, different control
goals were used for those with and without diabetes to
produce a more accurate control rate. However, there are
some limitations in our study. The BP goal for hypertensive
patients with diabetes was changed from 130/85 mm Hg to
130/80 mm Hg in 2003.5 Therefore, the BP control rates in
people with diabetes might seem poor before 2003. Inaccu-
racies in estimating BP control rates in the diabetic popula-
tion might also arise from not classifying diabetic people with
prehypertension as hypertensive, although they may require
antihypertensive medications to bring their BP to 130/
80 mm Hg. The limited sample sizes for each 2-year period
made the estimates in some subgroups less reliable and made
it difficult to study interactions between factors such as age,
sex, and race/ethnicity. Estimates of prevalence are substan-
tially affected by age adjustment. The age distribution of the
US general population, used for the adjustment standard, is
much younger than the hypertensive population, so the
adjustment emphasizes the estimates among the younger
population. A better standard population might be the age
distribution of those with hypertension, such as for the entire
1999­2004 period.

Perspectives
Our study indicated that there was no significant change in
the prevalence of hypertension in the US population in the
period 1999­2004. However, there were significant improve-
ments in the control rates, especially in the elderly. These
findings suggest that public health measures or changes in
clinical practice are in the right direction.
