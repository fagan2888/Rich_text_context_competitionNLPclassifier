Compassion and responsibility
for disease: Trump, tragedy

Abstract
Thinking about compassion helps to illuminate what is pernicious and beneficial about
emphasizing personal responsibility for health. This article considers whether it is
`compassionate' to see someone's disease as an embodiment of past faults. Two tra-
ditions, one Aristotelian-tragedic and the other Thomist and merciful, yield two ideas of
compassion. The argument is that disease should not be conceived as something for

which one is responsible in a way which risks the possibility of receiving treatment.
But preventive medicine is conceived as a moral endeavour intertwined with the pas-
toral care of the sick, with discretion as to the manner and timing of any focus on
responsibility.

Introduction
Donald Trump's 2017 choice to lead Medicare and Medicaid was Seema Verma
who claimed that her Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP)
. . . melds two themes of American society that typically collide in our health-care
system, rugged individualism and the Judeo-Christian ethic. HIP combines these dia-
metrically opposed themes by promoting personal responsibility while providing sub-
sidized health protection to those who can least afford it.1
What should be made of this? Personal responsibility to oneself and one's
neighbours arguably belongs to some kind of `ethic' rather than to a mere rugged
individualism. But an ethic that emphasizes personal responsibility is, she believes,
`diametrically opposed' to a `Judaeo-Christian' ethic that privileges concern for
those `who can least afford' health protection.
Is this how a Christian ethic, at least, should conceive of personal responsibility
in healthcare? The parable of the good Samaritan might give some support to this.
The `one who had mercy/compassion upon' the injured man is commended but this
key parable raises no question of whether the injured man was irresponsible
in taking the Jericho road, putting himself in harm's way. This is hardly an
endorsement of an ethic of patients' personal responsibility but rather of taking
responsibility for others' well-being. So perhaps Verma is both right and wrong on
what Christian wisdom offers to US healthcare.
Focusing on responsibility presses the question of how disease should be
conceived. Is disease, its prevention and its cure, in any sense rightly conceived
as the patient's responsibility? If so, does this in some way reformulate what com-
passion means in everyday clinician practice and patient experience, whether in the
USA or the NHS?
Responsibility in healthcare
Questions of responsibility characterize the collaborative relationships between
patients and healthcare staff which have largely replaced paternalist attitudes.
Patient choice, values and beliefs are central. In shared decision-making (SDM),
`clinicians and patients make decisions together using the best available
Hordern 103
evidence . . . [and] patients are encouraged to think about the available screening,
treatment, or management options and the likely benefits and harms of each'.2
Such SDM requires `collaborative deliberation', rooted in a relational notion of
autonomy `where the two (or sometimes more) parties ``dance together'', figuring
out who leads, and in what direction'. Collaborative deliberation `requires that
clinicians are curious about and respectful of patients' informed preferences, recog-
nizing that this process should incorporate insight about emotions, gut feelings,
and biases'.3 It thus `serves as an underpinning framework for empathic clinical
practice'.4
But `informing and exploring preferences is not enough'.5 SDM should involve
`an existential journey aimed at fostering patient autonomy with the curating help
of physicians who are attentive to patients' informational, emotional, and rela-
tional needs'. This relational autonomy aims to avoid both paternalism and aban-
donment to `bear the burden of self-blame if things go poorly'.6
For collaborative deliberation might over-correct paternalism to thrust
unwanted responsibility onto highly vulnerable people. Disease then transforms
into the occasion of becoming a `health-care sinner' because of poor past behaviour
and ill-judged choices for future treatment, adding burdens of guilt and worry on
top of the disease itself.
Thinking about compassion helps to illuminate what is pernicious and what is
beneficial about personal responsibility for health. Compassion is almost univer-
sally commended as basic to healthcare. But what one thinks about responsibility
in healthcare will shape the compassion one espouses. Understanding compassion
in relation to responsibility will enable an at least partial diagnosis of how disease is
conceived both by the one experiencing the disease and by other parties. Is it
compatible with compassion to conceive of someone's disease as a consequence
and embodiment of past faults and poor decisions?
Compassion in two traditions
Two classic traditions yield two ideas of compassion: eleos and misericordia.
Contrasting them sheds light on how responsibility and disease should be associated.7
Compassion-eleos
Compassion-eleos in Aristotle and in Greek tragedy provide useful counterpoints
to the Christian traditions considered below. For Aristotle's eleos ( feoB; often
translated as `pity'), desert is central:
Pity may be defined as a feeling of pain caused by the sight of some evil, destructive or
painful, which befalls one who does not deserve it, and which we might expect to
befall ourselves or some friend of ours, and moreover to befall us soon.8
104 Theology 121(2)
Those who deserve their bad condition ­ including those causally responsible for
their bad condition ­ are unworthy of `pity'. They may be dubbed the `undeserving
sick' ­ their sickness is so identified with their just deserts that they are undeserving
of eleos.
This bracing option seems frankly nai¨ve about distinguishing different causes of
disease. Martha Nussbaum nuances Aristotle's account through narratives con-
cerning desert `in Homeric and tragic appeals for compassion'.9 She recounts
how Philoctetes, an expert archer, en route to the Trojan War, trespasses on a
sanctuary. The gods punish him with a snakebite which develops into a painful,
pus-filled and smelly leg-wound. Being thus generally unpleasant as a companion,
he is abandoned by the Greeks on an island for ten years. However, realizing they
cannot defeat the Trojans without him, the Greeks return to pick him up. After
various treacherous twists, Neoptolemos, conflicted about Philoctetes' abuse and
suffering, resolves to help him.
Nussbaum's nuance is that it is
not inconsistent with [Aristotle's] account to have compassion for people for things
they do out of their own bad character or culpable negligence ­ so long as one can
either see the suffering as out of all proportion to the fault or view the bad character or
negligence as itself the product of forces to some extent excusably beyond the person's
control.10
Moreover, in a passage oddly neglected by Nussbaum, Philoctetes bitterly rejects
the assistance offered. And so Neoptolemos addresses him thus:
Men must bear the fortune given them by the gods. But those who are set upon by
damage that is of their own doing, such as yourself, it is just neither to have sympathy
for them, nor to pity them. You have become an animal, and refuse all advice: if
someone, thinking on your behalf, does give advice, you hate him, you consider him
an enemy.11
In collaborative deliberation, such eleos would entail compassion for misfortune
but not for patients who reject help, making their condition worse. The unjustly
treated if `undeserving sick' receive compassion; but not the apparently subhuman
and `obstinate sick'.
In summary, there is some discretion for how compassion relates to responsi-
bility and desert. Compassion-eleos is `a painful emotion occasioned by the aware-
ness of another person's undeserved misfortune'.12 Those responsible for their
suffering ­ those who have `brought it on themselves' ­ are not deserving of com-
passion-eleos although certain factors may mitigate this. In particular, compassion-
eleos is not appropriate to those who reject help to address their current suffering or
to prevent future suffering.

Compassion-misericordia
Aquinas interprets the eleos Jesus commends and the inner, bowel-level response of
the Samaritan to the injured man (e
\ spagni
syZ, esplanchnisth
e) in terms of
misericordia.13 Developing but qualifying some of Aristotle's insights and building
on Augustine, he writes that:
. . .mercy is heartfelt compassion for another's misery, a compassion which drives us to do
what we can to help him. Indeed the Latin word for mercy, Misericordia, comes from
one's heart being miserable (miserum cor), at the sight of another's distress. Now
misery is the opposite of happiness. But it is of the essence of beatitude or happiness
that a man gets what he wants: Happy the man, says Augustine, who has everything he
wants and wants nothing that is evil. Hence misery, on the other hand, implies that a
man suffers against his will.14
Aquinas is thinking through how virtues proper to human life relate to joy and the
hope of a stable, loving friendship with God. Happiness is not simply getting what
you want but wanting that which is good ­ that is, friendship with God ­ and getting
it. So how are compassion and responsibility interrelated? Aquinas argues that:
. . .there is a sense in which fault itself is punishment, in so far that there goes together
with it, something against the will of the sinner, and in this way it can be considered
deserving of mercy. . .15
. . .mercy is a kind of sadness. Now the reason for sadness is always some weakness;
that is why. . .sick people become sad more easily than others. It follows that the
reason why one person has mercy on another is because he himself suffers some
weakness.16
The reason given elsewhere for this claimed propensity to sadness among the sick is
that harms suffered by those already sick are felt more grievously.17 Thus Aquinas
claims that the conditions people experience on account of their faults are suffering
enough: something is happening against their will to be happy (even if, as Aquinas
allows, happiness is not conceived as friendship with God). This thwarting of the
will is, he thinks, punishment enough for any fault which has contributed to their
condition.
Mercy or misericordia emerges as sadness which arises because of weakness:
weakness, generally speaking, in the one exercising misericordia just as much as
the one receiving it; weakness, specifically, in the form of disease, which may or
may not be linked to some specifically moral weakness. The conception is not of the
undeserving or obstinate sick but rather of the `sad sick'. But to talk of the sad sick
is not necessarily to dismiss issues of responsibility regarding any sin which engen-
ders sickness and sadness.
106 Theology 121(2)
An experienced hospital chaplain comments that
. . .the relationship between a person's way of life, sin and disease in many cases is
obvious and often lurks in the background of conversation with patients. . .[exoner-
ation is not] a theologically proper or humanly helpful answer to the question con-
cerning some one's own responsibility for the event of having become sick.18
Sin is to be reckoned with, not treated as a category inapplicable to disease.
Honestly examining responsibility rather than inappropriately ignoring it (exoner-
ation) makes conceivable a compassion-misericordia in which responsibility for
disease is treated with leniency. This attitude stems from God's providence, justice
and mercy, which aims to restore sinners to friendship with God. It accompanies an
understanding of human weakness, negligence and deliberate fault. This in no way
implies downplaying the accidental conditions of life and diseases which simply
come upon us. However, questions concerning those matters for which we are,
more or less, responsible are not neglected.
This merciful mental process, properly routinized, will cultivate an attitude of
compassionate candour in collaborative deliberation with those who suffer disease,
engaging in past faults and future responsibilities where relevant and appropriate.
Disease is not necessarily an alien intrusion unrelated to the subject's agency but
may somehow be interwoven with it. At the same time, compassion-misericordia
rejects a judgementalism which ignores other party's faults and responsibilities,
underplays environmental factors or requires more strength than people can
muster. What emerges is an ethos of lenient if searching accommodation of persons
in their weakness, failure and faults amidst the accidents of life.
If fault is reckoned with and yet treated with the heartfelt sadness of mercy,
what follows for the subjective self-awareness of the sufferer, the self-conception of
disease? The chaplain comments that:
Disease, insofar as it is experienced as a life crisis, can awaken a person to a dimension
of sin which encompasses and determines his life as a whole, and which cannot be
limited to a moral guilt in view of singular actions.19
Such awakenings hardly imply that suffering or its likely onset always makes
people `come to their senses' and change their lives. Evidence suggests that
taking responsibility for healthy behaviour change is seldom primarily associated
with understanding one's genetically informed risk profile. Indeed, connecting
health and disease with more subtle sources of self-understanding seems a more
psychologically plausible way to encourage responsibility taking.20
Thus, such awakenings are potentially significant pastoral matters inasmuch as
they concern the perception of the self's responsibility for disease. A distinction is
important here. Awakening to responsibility in SDM as a prospectively oriented
Hordern 107
activity differs from self-perceptions informed by a solely retrospective introspec-
tion about one's responsibility for disease. In SDM the dangers lie principally in a
perhaps unwanted level of patient choice and that `burden of self-blame if things go
poorly'.21 Nonetheless, pastorally speaking, a psychologically plausible process of
collaborative deliberation must incorporate some retrospective consciousness of
how past unhealthy ways of life may contribute to a poor outcome to any pro-
spective treatment decision made.
So how should compassionate, candid, collaborative deliberation incorporate,
with pastoral sensitivity, this complex self-awareness regarding responsibility both
for disease and its treatment? Self-consciousness is associated with conscience in
Christian thought ­ a self-conception which may involve both approving and dis-
approving thoughts. To give rise to a bad conscience but then fail to support
change ­ pastorally, clinically and environmentally ­ seems as irresponsible as
denying the possible benefits of a troubled conscience is implausible.22
To develop this pastoral line, Aquinas cites St Augustine to demonstrate that
what he calls fraternal correction is itself a feature of compassion-misericordia:
it is. . .the discretion of charity that makes us spare evil-doers, not rebuking them or
chiding them on the spot, but waiting to find a more favourable occasion; or again
because we fear that it will only make them worse, or cause them to hinder and
oppress others who are weak and need instruction in a life of goodness and piety,
even to the extent of turning them away from the faith.23
What it is pastorally wise to say and do is again seen against the horizon of
friendship with God through faith. Wisdom involves picking your moment or, in
some cases, avoiding any reckoning with responsibility altogether. At the same
time, there may be real benefit through an early, pastoral engagement with respon-
sibility for disease. This may be particularly relevant when others are directly
affected by one's actions. I think of the mother I heard movingly describe her
daily self-reproach for the wrong she thought she had done her child by smoking
during pregnancy.
Pastorally speaking, while giving space for acknowledgement of personal
responsibility, Christian thought recognizes that circumstances which cause ill
health are commonly complex. This clearly matters for how disease is conceived.
The Reformed Protestant tradition, for example, emphasizes that sin is both per-
sonal and environmental ­ people's health is buffeted by forces and factors not
simply within their control.24
Similarly, over against Aristotle's perhaps nai¨ve view, disease is only rarely
attributable to a single cause. Accordingly, since causal factors are so conflated,
while there is a willingness to get down to granularity about personal responsibility
for health and disease, for many Christian thinkers, there is also a deeper unwill-
ingness to link such responsibility to sanctions ­ e.g. the refusal to provide treat-
ment. Moreover, precisely because people's experience of ill health may itself be
108 Theology 121(2)
psychologically debilitating, the tendency narrated by Sophocles to regard the
obstinate sick as subhuman is guarded against.
On this, Ruth Groenhout warns that
The language of sin often doesn't arise in the healthcare context. . .When it does arise
it lends itself easily to fairly simplistic types of individual blame and shame.25
This admittedly deep problem of attributing responsibility for disease in ways which
are sophisticated with respect to causality and human psychology does not make the
attribution of responsibility an inappropriate activity in every circumstance ­ just a
very difficult one. It is not that sin does not exist with respect to health but rather that
finding appropriate ways of identifying it and enabling liberation from it, thereby
limiting its destructive nature, requires immense pastoral wisdom.
In summary, any attempt to interrelate retrospective and prospective reckoning
with responsibility requires the discretion and pastoral insight of compassion-
misericordia. Engaging sorrowfully with the sad weakness, negligence and deliber-
ate fault of patients as responsible citizens, amidst the accidents of life, is not only
permissible but commonly necessary. However, it is hemmed in very tightly indeed
by pastoral sensitivity to self-awareness defined by conscience and to alertness to
how those who shape the structures and environments which surround health are
also bearers of responsibility. As Scott Rae puts it, writing from a US perspective,
While still taking personal responsibility seriously, it is often difficult to hold someone
fully responsible for choices that have been impacted by the systemic components of
sin. This is why as a society we have been reluctant to give much weight to the concept
of desert as a criterion for the distribution of healthcare resources. . .However, if one's
lifestyle makes them non-cooperative as patients and unwilling to contribute to their
care, that may be a factor in their future course of treatment.26
Similarly, Eibach, writing from a German perspective, agrees but claims that in
order to encourage the personal responsibility which will underpin `preventive
medicine'
. . .it should be the churches' task to make it clear once again that human life is not
man's property, but a unique gift of God, and that man is responsible for his use of
this gift in the eyes of God. Man can indeed become guilty with regard to his body and
his life, and he must stand up for this guilt in the eyes of God.27
Conclusion
The parable of the Good Samaritan is important to understanding the interrelation
of compassion and responsibility. There is a basic neighbourly duty of compassion
Hordern 109
towards the sick whatever the circumstances. Nonetheless, we need a wider view to
understand the complex psychology which is at work in conceiving disease within
healthcare. On one level, there is the question of the psychological attitude of
compassion towards those in need. Nussbaum's attention to Aristotle and Greek
tragedy draws out how compassion, both in attitude and in practical outworking,
may be defined not only by past circumstances and failings but also by the present
behaviour of the sick including their refusal to accept help.
However, for the Christian authors considered here, disease is not conceived as
something for which one is responsible in a way which puts at risk the possibility of
receiving treatment: disease is not reduced into personal agency in ways which bind
burdens of responsibility indiscriminately on people's backs. Even if there is the
possibility of not receiving treatment, the agent's past moral responsibility is not
thought decisive but rather the likely benefit to the patient who is perhaps `non-
cooperative' or `unwilling' to care for themselves. This leads to an affirmation both
of preventive medicine as a moral endeavour and of the pastoral care of the sick,
with discretion as to the manner and timing of any focus on responsibility.
This is neither Seema Verma's rugged individualism, nor is it simply protection
for the most vulnerable, a compassion apparently pure and unalloyed by consid-
erations of responsibility. It is a pastorally sensitive, multi-layered attention to
personal responsibility, which simultaneously locates that responsibility within a
complex web of responsibilities. This seems vital to a workable Christian ethic of
compassion for the new shape of healthcare, in which many patients increasingly
have responsibility both in decision-making and in managing their own care, both
in the US system and in the UK's NHS.

7. The exploration of compassion here sheds light on how the term should be distinguished
from `empathy' as deployed in the articles by Graham Collins and Katherine
Southwood in this issue. Though the issue requires greater space than is possible here,
my analysis of compassion suggests that `empathy' is not an emotion as such (pace Carel
as cited by Southwood), though it may partially constitute the imaginative element of
compassion which Nussbaum describes (see below). For another view of `empathy', see
