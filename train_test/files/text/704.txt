AMERICANS
REPORT ON
THEIR ACCESS TO
HEALTH CARE
by Howard E. Freeman, Robert J. Blendon, Linda H.
Aiken, Seymour Sudman, Connie F. Mullinix, and
Christopher R. Corey _________________
Prologue: Most Americans believe that health care should be avail-
able toall those who are sick or injured, regardless ofeconomic or
other circumstances. At the same time, most Americans consider the
cost ofmedical care as the most troubling dimension ofthe provision of
this service, and believe that cost constraints should be applied. Where
to make such reductions without erasing the gains achieved inaccess
tocare over the last several decades, or hurting the leastfortunate
among us, isthe issue. Inthis lead essay, Howard Freeman and his
colleagues report signs of deterioration inaccess to medical carefor the
nations poor, minorities, and uninsured. Their study isthe third study
onaccess underwritten by The Robert WoodJohnson Foundation.
The two previous access studies, ironically, provoked substantially dif-
ferent reactions, stemming morefrom a change inthepolitical climate
thanfrom thefindings themselves. At the time ofthefirst survey, 1976,
national health insurance (NHI) legislation was a live issue. Its advo
cates were critical of the survey results because they showed many
more people with access tocare than NHI rhetoric suggested. Inthe
more constrained climate of 1982, the second survey provoked criti-
cismfrom conservative quarters because ithighlighted the relatively
small number ofpeople who lacked access to care. The lead author of
this most recent survey is a professor ofsociology at the University of
California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Robert Blendon, who holds a doc-
torate inhealth policy and managementfrom TheJohns Hopkins

REPORT ON ACCESS 7
In developing its initial grantmaking program in the early 1970s, The
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation chose to emphasize improving
access to health care in the United States. There were many press
accounts at the time about the difficulties Americans experienced ob
taining medical care, but there was little timely and systematic informa
tion about the overall magnitude of the problem, its distribution among
various population groups, and changes over time. To acquire this
information, the Johnson Foundation supported three independent
national studies in 1976, 1982, and 1986 to measure the extent to which
individuals were experiencing problems obtaining medical care.1These
surveys built on a research approach first implemented by the Commit
tee on the Costs of Medical Care in the early 1930s, which was later
extended and refined by Odin Anderson, Ronald Andersen, and their
colleagues at the University of Chicago.2
This paper highlights results from the recently completed 1986 survey
of access to and use of health services.3 Six findings are of particular
significance: (1) Between 1982 and 1986, Americans' overall use of
medical care declined in terms of hospitalization and per capita physician
visits. (2) Access to physician care for individuals who were poor, black,
or uninsured decreased between 1982 and 1986, particularly for those in
poor health. (3) Hospitalizations have also declined for these disad
vantaged groups, but the reduction is comparable to that experienced by
the entire population. However, the uninsured and black and Hispanic
Americans continue to receive less hospital care than might be appropri
ate given their higher rates of ill health. (4) Though much has been
written about the overuse of medical care, this study found signs of
underuse of important health services among key population groups. (5)
The long-standing gap in receipt of medical care between rural and urban
residents appears to have been eliminated. (6) Most Americans continue
to be highly satisfied with their physician and inpatient hospital care. In
addition, emergency care, which was a source of some dissatisfaction in
1982, received higher marks in 1986.
Methods
Data reported in this article come from two telephone surveys con
ducted in 1982 and 1986, using similar research instruments and design.
Each respondent was interviewed for approximately twenty-five minutes
about various aspects of access to medical care: the availability of a
personal physician or usual source of care; the actual use of doctors,
other health professionals, and hospitals; self-reports of health status;
the presence of serious health conditions; problems in paying for care;
and the degree of satisfaction with the care received. Supplemental face-
to-face interviews were conducted in 1986 with a small sample of people

without telephones in three geographically dispersed communities. The
findings of this survey confirm, as others have concluded, that if house
holds without telephones were added to those surveyed by telephone,
the findings would not be significantly different.4
The 1986 study consisted of interviews with 10,130 people in the
continental United States, 76 percent of those selected for interviews.5
People with chronic and serious illnesses were oversampled; the study
group was weighted, however, so that the findings represent the U.S.
population. Proxy interviews with a parent were conducted in order to
obtain information on children under age seventeen. Also in cases where
the respondent was too sick or otherwise unable to be interviewed, a
proxy interview with another person in the household was completed.
The 1982 data are from the previous foundation-supported survey
undertaken by Louis Harris and Associates in conjunction with the
University of Chicago.6 The study group consisted of approximately
6,700 adults and children. The 1982 sample was reweighted for the
purposes of this analysis to be consistent with the procedures used for the
1986 sample; thus, there are small differences in the 1982 results reported
here and in previous publications from the study.
The average number of physician visits reported in these two surveys
differs somewhat from those reported by the National Center for Health
Statistics because telephone consultations are not counted as visits in our
two surveys. Also, the interviewers in our surveys probed to gain in
formation on all visits to specialists, including mental health profes
sionals, in 1986, which is not usually done in other national surveys.
Decline In The Use Of Medical Care
Between 1982 and 1986, the average use of medical care declined
across all population groups. As illustrated in Exhibit 1, the percentage
of Americans hospitalized one or more times in the year prior to the
survey declined by 22 percent. One-third of Americans did not visit a
physician even once in the year prior to the survey, a major change since
1982. Average per capita visits to physicians declined by 10 percent, a

consequence of the reduced portion of the population with any ambula
tory contacts in 1986. It should be noted, however, that mean physician
visit rates reported in the 1982 survey were higher than other studies
undertaken that year, including the Health Interview Survey.7Hence, the
difference in visits between our 1982 and 1986 data may overstate
somewhat the actual decline in physician utilization.
Over the past two decades, a larger proportion of Americans have
reported having access to a regular source of care, usually a particular
private physician.8Studies have suggested that patients may receive more
appropriate and effective health care when they have a single source for
care--a place where there is some continuing knowledge of their health
status and problems over time.9However, as Exhibit 1 shows, a larger
proportion of Americans in 1986 compared with 1982 report having no
single usual source of care (18 percent compared to 11 percent). Even
among people who report having a usual source of care, there appears to
be more use of multiple physicians and settings. For example, of those
who had a particular personal physician in 1982, 95 percent reported
seeing that doctor on their last visit. In 1986, only 79 percent went to their
regular doctor on their last visit.
The surveys do not provide data that permit a full explanation of the
reduced use of physician and hospital care. The changes are consistent,
however, with a number of trends in health care nationally including
greater use of coinsurance and deductibles in private health insurance
plans, increased out-of-pocket medical care costs, more widespread use of
hospital preadmission screening, an increase in ambulatory surgery, and
the rapid growth of urgent care centers.
Deteriorating Access For The Poor, Minorities, And Uninsured
Data on the number of visits people make to doctors' offices and
hospitals do not tell us all we wish to know about the accessibility of
health care in the United States. For example, visit rates tell us little
about the appropriateness of treatment received. Visit rates do provide
one window, however, on the accessibility of personal health services to
different groups in the country. Moreover, the usefulness of this measure
of accessibility can be enhanced by taking into account individuals'
relative need for health care. The President's Commission for the Study
of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Re
search in its 1983 report recommended that adjustments be made for
health status in all comparisons of physician utilization rates between
groups.1
0Earlier studies have shown that a person's self-assessment of
health status is a reasonably sensitive indicator of actual need for medical
care, including the presence of chronic conditions and disabilities, the
number of specific health problems and symptoms, sensory impairment

and immobility, and limitations of normal activities due to illness.1
1
The following exhibits, then, report utilization of physician and
hospital care by health status for the poor, minorities, and the uninsured.
Two types of comparisons are made: (1) the percent change between
1982 and 1986; and (2) the gap in receipt of care between different
groups. The gap is the percent difference between two groups using the
majority group as the standard against which the other is compared.
Low-income Americans. The earliest access study, undertaken in
1931, found that people with low incomes saw physicians 50 percent less
frequently than did those with higher incomes.1
2This gap was of particu
lar concern because of evidence that serious illness was more common
among the poor. By the mid-1970s, after decades of gradual progress, this
inequity in the frequency of use of physician services had been largely
eliminated. Indeed, individuals from lower income groups were actually
seeing physicians slightly more often than those of higher incomes,
which reflected their higher burden of illness.1
3
However, between 1982 and 1986, this improved situation changed,
particularly for low-income groups who were in poorer health. The
nation's low-income citizens received less physician care, on average, in
1986 than comparable groups did in 1982. Between 1982 and 1986 as
shown in Exhibit 2, physician visit rates for low-income individuals in
poorer health declined by 8 percent while visit rates for the nonpoor of
similar health status increased by 42 percent. This widened a gap that
had all but disappeared. By 1986, the poor had 27 percent fewer
physician visits than did the nonpoor of the same health status. This
suggests a significant reversal in the longstanding trend toward greater
equity in the accessibility of physician care.
Low-income adults, particularly those under age sixty-five, have ex
perienced marked declines in physician visits since 1982 (Exhibit 3). The
average number of physician visits declined by 30 percent for poor adults

under age sixty-five while no change was found for the nonpoor. By
1986, poor and nonpoor adults under age sixty-five were seeing physi
cians at roughly the same rates even though almost three times more of
the poor reported themselves in only fair or poor health. If poor and
nonpoor adults had comparable access to physicians, we would expect
the poor to see physicians more often because a larger proportion are in
ill health. The same trends in access are noted for the elderly. Poor and
nonpoor elderly saw physicians at the same rates in 1986 despite a higher
proportion of poor elderly reporting themselves in ill health. Access to
physician care for poor children remained about the same over the
period, but physician use rates for poor children do not reflect that more
poor children than nonpoor children are in ill health.
A number of changes in the organization and financing of hospital
care occurred between 1982 and 1986. There has been much speculation
about how these changes affected low-income Americans. The national
decline in hospital use mentioned earlier is reflected in a reduction of
hospitalization among both poor and nonpoor Americans, as indicated
in Exhibit 4. The poor were more likely than the nonpoor in both 1982

and 1986 to have been hospitalized at least once in a year, which appears
to be justified in view of the larger proportion of low-income individuals
in ill health. Our data do not permit an assessment, however, of whether
the levels of hospital use by the poor in either 1982 or 1986 were
appropriate to their actual levels of need.
Access for minorities. An important measure of equity of access is the
frequency of the use of health services by minorities. Hispanics, on
average, see physicians at about the same rate as whites. For black
Americans, however, the 1986 survey portrays a picture of diminishing
access to medical care. As indicated in Exhibit 5, physician visit rates for
blacks declined between 1982 and 1986. Thus, by 1986, there was a
difference of 33 percent between physician visit rates of blacks and
whites in ill health, and about the same for those in good health. The
growing gap in physician visits between blacks and whites is of particular
concern in view of the evidence recently assembled by the National
Institutes of Health showing that black Americans have a considerably
higher mortality rate than whites have.1
4
All ethnic groups were affected by the overall national decline in
hospital use (Exhibit 6). However, the study shows that in both 1982 and
1986 there were significant gaps in receipt of hospital care for Hispanics
compared to whites despite a greater proportion of Hispanics in ill
health. Blacks were also less likely than whites to be hospitalized given

their poorer health status.
Access for the uninsured. Health insurance continues to be an impor
tant factor influencing access to medical care. The nation's uninsured
population contains a somewhat larger share of people in fair or poor
health than is found among those with health insurance. Thus, if there
were no economic barriers to care, the receipt of physician services and
hospital care by the uninsured would be expected to exceed that received
by the insured. As can be seen in Exhibit 7, the uninsured had fewer
physician visits and were less likely than the insured to be hospitalized in
both 1982 and 1986.1
5The gap between the uninsured and the insured in
average number of physician visits widened substantially in 1986, sug
gesting that the uninsured are experiencing greater difficulty obtaining
physician care. While the gap in receipt of hospital care narrowed over
the period, a 19 percent difference still remains between the uninsured
and the insured. In both 1982 and 1986, a smaller proportion of the
uninsured were hospitalized than their higher burden of illness suggests
might be appropriate.
Those surveyed were also asked if they had ever failed to obtain
needed medical care for economic reasons. The results, presented in
Exhibit 8, closely parallel the other findings. Of those interviewed, 6
percent, representing approximately 13.5 million Americans, reported
not receiving medical care for financial reasons. An estimated 1 million
individuals actually tried to obtain needed care but did not receive it.
The majority of Americans experiencing these difficulties were poor,
uninsured, or minorities.
Underuse Of Medical Care
Growing concerns about the nation's rising health care bill have led to
an almost exclusive focus by public and private sector policymakers on
how to reduce the unnecessary overuse of costly health care. Less

attention has been directed to the possibility of serious underuse of
medical care by some people. The results from this study point to
particular problems of underuse across the country.
Exhibit 9 presents data providing measures of potential underuse of
medical care by different groups in the country. One in six Americans
who had an identifiable chronic and serious illness (such as cancer, heart
disease, diabetes, and stroke) did not see a physician even once during the
year. Many physicians would agree that patients with such illnesses
should be seen by a doctor at least annually.
The survey also asked respondents whether, over the past thirty days,
they had experienced one or more symptoms judged by a panel of
physicians to warrant care in most instances, and if so, whether they
sought medical attention. These serious symptoms were adapted from an
instrument developed by the University of Chicago, and subsequently
modified for use in the Rand Health Insurance Experiment.1

REPORT ON ACCESS 15
respondents who had at least one physician visit in the year, 41 percent
reported the occurrence of one or more of five serious symptoms and did
not see or tell a physician about the problem. These symptoms included
bleeding, other than nosebleeds or menstrual periods, not caused by
accidents; shortness of breath after light exercise; loss of consciousness,
fainting, or passing out; chest pain when exercising; and weight loss of
more than ten pounds (except for dieting). The large proportion of
people who failed to visit or telephone a physician in the face of having
these symptoms is of concern.
Likewise, the large proportion of pregnant women who did not seek
prenatal care in the first three months of their pregnancy is troubling.
Infant mortality has been reduced by half since 1960, but the rates of
infant death in the United States still exceed those of many other
comparable industrialized countries. A recent Institute of Medicine
study concluded that early prenatal care leads to improved maternal and
infant outcomes.1
7It is therefore of concern to find that one in seven
pregnant women surveyed in 1986 did not seek medical care early in their
pregnancy.
The study also found signs of underuse of medical care for persons
diagnosed as having hypertension. This disease is associated with two of
the nation's major killers--heart disease and stroke. Thus, it is of concern
that 20 percent of people with diagnosed hypertension surveyed in 1986
--and almost one-third of blacks and Hispanics with this condition--did
not have their blood pressure checked at least once during the year.
Americans have traditionally underused dental services, and this
trend appears to have continued. Thirty-eight percent of all respondents
had not visited a dentist in a year; only half of low-income individuals
reported a dental visit.
These data taken together suggest that a substantial number of Ameri
cans may not be getting as much health care as they need. The reasons
may include social and cultural factors as well as financial barriers.
However, the presence of signs of underuse among all segments of the
population also suggests a lack of understanding of appropriate use of
medical care and a need for improved public education.
Other Findings__________________________________________________
Improved access for rural Americans. A positive finding in the 1986
survey is that rural Americans, on average, appear to be receiving as
much medical care as their urban counterparts, as indicated in Exhibit
10. Closing the rural/urban gap in access to health services has been a
national goal for many years. That goal now appears to have been
achieved. This is not to say, of course, that residents of some isolated
rural communities do not still experience problems obtaining timely

medical care. The same is true for some inner-city residents. However, it
is clear that major strides have been made in improving the geographic
accessibility of physician and hospital services.
Satisfaction with medical care. Despite substantial disparities between
various groups in their access to medical care, most Americans remain
highly satisfied with the care they receive from physicians and hospitals.
Even the modest levels of dissatisfaction with emergency care found in
1982 had declined by 1986 (Exhibit 11).
Conclusion
The results of the 1986 University of California, Los Angeles survey,
the largest supported by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to date,
are both surprising and disturbing. Many of the nation's forecasters in
health have clearly not been on the mark. An aging population, a
growing supply of physicians, and more and better medical technologies
have not, as predicted, led to significant increases in use of health care per
person. Rather, this study suggests that there has been a decline in visits
to physicians and in the proportion of people hospitalized. This trend
cuts across all groups within our country and is difficult to fully explain.
Some will obviously associate this with the many changes now occurring

in health care arrangements that emphasize lower utilization of health
care resources, including health maintenance organizations, preferred
provider organizations, utilization review, and diagnosis-related groups.
This study cannot answer the critical questions of whether Americans
are sicker or remain in ill health longer because they receive less medical
care today than they did in 1982. There are, however, significant num
bers of individuals who have serious and potentially life-threatening
illnesses who do not appear to use health care appropriately. This may
prove to be a problem requiring more public education or it may reflect
unrecognized financial or professional barriers to care.
On the positive side, after many years of national attention to achiev
ing a more equitable geographic distribution of health resources, rural
Americans, on average, appear to be receiving as much medical care as
urban residents. While some isolated rural communities clearly have
continuing problems that should not be overlooked, we can take some
pride in knowing that medical care is reasonably accessible nationwide.
Also on a positive note, Americans continue to express a high level of
satisfaction with the medical care they receive.
Clearly, the most disturbing findings relate to the signs of deteriora
tion in access to medical care for the nation's poor, minorities, and the
uninsured. In particular, the poor and black Americans have experi
enced a reversal of the gains in access to physician care made over the
previous two decades, moving us further from securing more equitable
access to care for all.
