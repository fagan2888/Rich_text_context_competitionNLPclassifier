between income inequality and SWB. The meta-analysis
confirmed these findings. The overall association between
income inequality and SWB was almost zero and not statisti-
cally significant (pooled r=-0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06;
Q=563.10, I2=95.74%, p<0.001), suggesting no associa-
tion between income inequality and SWB. Subgroup analy-
ses showed that the association between income inequality
and SWB was moderated by the country economic develop-
ment (i.e. developed countries: r=-0.06, 95% CI -0.10
to -0.02 versus developing countries: r=0.16, 95% CI
0.09­0.23). The association between income inequality and
SWB was not influenced by: (a) the measure used to assess
SWB, (b) geographic region, or (c) the way in which income
inequality was operationalised.
Conclusions The association between income inequality
and SWB is weak, complex and moderated by the country
economic development.

Introduction
Income inequality is one of many possible determinants of
subjective well-being (SWB) [1, 2]. There is a view that
income inequality--the unequal distribution of household
income across different participants in an economy (OECD,
2011)--is a predictor of SWB and that decreasing income
inequality will boost SWB [3, 4]. However, the assumed
linear relationship between income inequality and SWB is
not grounded in a solid research evidence base. In fact, our
scoping search yielded studies that showed mixed findings:
some studies show a significant positive association between
SWB and income inequality [5, 6], some show a significant
Abstract
Background Reducing income inequality is one possible
approach to boost subjective well-being (SWB). Neverthe-
less, previous studies have reported positive, null and nega-
tive associations between income inequality and SWB.
Objectives This study reports the first systematic review
and meta-analysis of the relationship between income ine-
quality and SWB, and seeks to understand the heterogeneity
in the literature.
Methods This systematic review was conducted accord-
ing to guidance (PRISMA and Cochrane Handbook) and
searches (between January 1980 and October 2017) were
carried out using Web of Science, Medline, Embase and
PsycINFO databases.
Results Thirty-nine studies were included in the review,
but poor data reporting meant that only 24 studies were
included in the meta-analysis. The narrative analysis of
39 studies found negative, positive and null associations

negative association [4, 7, 8] and others show no significant
association [9]. One explanation of these inconsistent find-
ings is that the strength and the direction of the relation-
ship between SWB and income inequality are moderated by
other factors. For example, although both happiness and life
satisfaction have been used interchangeably to assess SWB
across different studies, these terms are not synonymous and
might relate differently to income inequality [10]. Similarly,
the literature suggests that level of economic development
[11, 12], geography [8] and how income inequality is opera-
tionalised [13] may affect the relationship between income
inequality and SWB [14].
Given that the relationship between income inequality
and SWB is important to social policy decisions, it is sur-
prising that no systematic evaluation of this literature has
yet been undertaken. We therefore decided to undertake the
first systematic review of the literature to examine the link
between income inequality and SWB. The objectives were:
1. to examine the direction and the magnitude of the asso-
ciation between income inequality and SWB;
2. to examine the factors that may moderate the association
between income inequality and SWB. On the basis of
previous research evidence, we focused on the effects of
· types of measures of SWB (i.e. happiness versus life
satisfaction),
· country level of development (i.e. developed coun-
tries versus developing countries),
· geographic region (e.g. studies conducted in the USA
versus studies conducted in Europe).
· the way income inequality was operationalised
(exogenous Gini versus endogenous Gini).
Methods
The systematic review was conducted and reported accord-
ing to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and Cochrane Handbook rec-
ommendations [15, 16].
Search strategy and data sources
Systematic searches of the literature published between Jan-
uary 1980 and October 2017 were carried out using Web of
Science, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO. Combinations
of two key blocks of terms were used: (1) SWB, happiness,
life satisfaction, quality of life, well-being and (2) income
inequality, income level, social equality, income disparities,
income redistribution. We also checked the reference lists
of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria. The search
strategy in each of the databases is presented in Appendix 1
(see Supplementary Material).
Study selection
Screening was completed in two stages. Initially, the titles
and abstracts of the identified studies were screened for eli-
gibility. Next, the full texts of studies initially assessed as
"relevant" for the review were retrieved and checked against
our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Authors were contacted and
asked for further information if necessary, most frequently
for the zero-order correlation between income inequality and
SWB [17]. The screening process is presented in Appendix 2
(see Supplementary Material).
Eligibility criteria
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following
criteria:
1. Original studies that employed quantitative methods.
Qualitative studies were excluded.
2. Included a measure of income inequality (i.e. exogenous
Gini and endogenous Gini).
3. Included a measure of SWB (happiness and/or life sat-
isfaction) [18, 19].
4. Provided quantitative data regarding the association
between income inequality and SWB.
5. Were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Grey lit-
erature was excluded because they were not published
through conventional and credible publishers.
Data extraction
Information about the following characteristics of the studies
was extracted: (1) first author name and year of publica-
tion, country where study was conducted, participant char-
acteristics, period of the study, data used, research design,
measures of SWB, measure of income inequality, zero-order
correlations, regression coefficient, direction of the associa-
tion, country level of development; and (2) methodological
quality of the study, namely validity of measures, quality of
the research design, population and recruitment methods,
and control of confounders. Data extraction was completed
by the first author. A second researcher extracted data from
three randomly selected studies.
Assessment of methodological quality
The quality review included assessment of the quality of
the research design, population and recruitment methods,
verified if the choice of the income inequality measure and
SWB measures were valid and reliable, and if the analysis

reported the association between income inequality and
SWB (Table 1). Of 39 studies, 15 were given a high-quality
rating of 6/6 and the remaining 24 studies were given a lower
quality rating of 5/6.
Narrative synthesis
The narrative synthesis of all 39 eligible studies focused
on the way SWB is assessed, country level of development,
geographic region and the way income inequality was
operationalised.
Data analysis
Our plan was to pool the results of the association between
income inequality and SWB across the individual studies
using meta-analysis. Authors of published papers that did
not report data in a form amenable for meta-analysis were
contacted and eight authors provided further information.
We performed a meta-analysis on all 24 studies reporting
the correlation coefficients between income inequality and
SWB. Studies that assessed both happiness and life satisfac-
tion were reported separately in the subgroups in order to
test whether variation is due to the way SWB was assessed.
Using the World Bank classification of countries, we per-
formed another subgroup analysis to examine whether the
results differed between developed and developing coun-
tries. According to the World Bank, developed countries are
defined as industrial countries, advanced economies with
high level of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of
12,736 US dollars per year (estimated in July 2015) [20, 21].
In contrast, developing countries includes countries with low
and middle levels of GNI per capita (>12,736 US dollars)
[20, 21].
The associated Confidence Intervals (CI) of the zero-
order correlations were calculated in STATA 13.1 [22].
The pooled zero-order correlation as well as the forest plots
were computed using the meta-an command for STATA
[22]. A random effects model was used for all the meta-
analyses because of anticipated heterogeneity. Heterogeneity
was assessed using the Cochran's Q and Higgin's 
I2 statistic
[16]. We focus our interpretation of the results in terms of
effect sizes [23]. To test whether the association between
income inequality and SWB varies across subgroups, we
used Cohen's q to test whether there were significant dif-
ferences in the magnitudes of the correlation coefficients
following Fisher's z transformation of r [24]. By conven-
tion, if z score values are greater than or equal to 1.96 or
less than or equal to -1.96, the two correlation coefficients
are significantly different at a 0.05 alpha level (suggesting
difference of correlation coefficients between two population
groups) [25, 26].
Results
A total of 619 titles were retrieved, and after removing dupli-
cates (n=250), 336 journal articles, 30 books and 5 disserta-
tions were screened for relevance. Following tittle/abstract
and full-text screening, 39 articles were deemed eligible
for the narrative analysis and 24 studies were eligible for
meta-analysis. The flowchart of the screening and selection
process is shown in Fig. 1.
Descriptive characteristics of the studies
Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the 39 articles
included in the review. Table 1 provides details about the
country in which each study was conducted, participant
characteristics, data used, research design and measures
used to assess SWB and income inequality. Table 1 presents
the zero-order correlation and regression coefficients, the
outcome of the association between income inequality and
SWB, and the quality ratings.
Six studies were conducted in the USA, 11 studies were
conducted in Europe, two in Latin America, ten worldwide
(including all continents) and nine elsewhere or used dif-
ferent groupings (e.g. three in China, two in Industrialised
countries, one in Russia, one in Israel, one in developing
countries and one in Taiwan)--please see Table 1 for more
details. All studies were published between 1977 and 2015
and participants were adults aged between 16 and 99 years.
The sample size varied from 1277 to 278,134 and recruited
from different groups including students, workers, self-
employed and general population. Studies used data from a
range of surveys such as the General Social Survey (GSS),
World Value Survey (WVS), Eurobarometer, world database
of happiness (WDH), European quality of life (EQL) and
Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP). Most studies
were conducted in developed nations. Only four studies were
conducted exclusively in developing countries (three studies
in China and one study in Russia). Different measures were
used to assess SWB (e.g. happiness [4] and life satisfaction
[12]) and income inequality (e.g. Gini coefficient [28], 80/20
skew [29]).
Narrative synthesis of the results including studies
with nonamenable data
Thirty-nine studies were included for the narrative analy-
sis of the association between income inequality and SWB.
The overall evidence for the relationship between income
inequality and SWB was mixed, negative, positive or non-
significant across studies (see Table 1). The narrative syn-
thesis focused on four factors.

SWB assessment (i.e. happiness versus life satisfaction)
14/39 studies assessed happiness and 21 studies used life
satisfaction to assess SWB. The remaining four studies used
both happiness and life satisfaction to assess SWB. Of 14
studies using happiness to assess the SWB, eight reported a
negative association and six reported a positive association
with income inequality. Of 21 studies using life satisfac-
tion to assess SWB, 12 reported a negative association, six
reported a positive association and three found no relation-
ship. The remaining four studies that used both happiness
and life satisfaction reported negative (n=2), positive (n=1)
and no (n=1) associations.
Country level of development
Using the World Bank classification of countries [20], our
narrative analysis shows that 21 studies were conducted in
developed countries, of which 18 reported a statistically sig-
nificant negative association between income inequality and
SWB and the remaining three report a statistically signifi-
cant positive association. Studies that were conducted world-
wide (n=9) report both negative (n=4) and positive (n=4)
associations, and one study found no association [44]. The
remaining nine studies that were conducted in developing
countries report a positive (n=6) or no association (n=3)
between income inequality and SWB. Studies conducted in
Russia, rural China and Rwanda report a positive association
between income inequality and SWB [46, 50, 53, 56]. While
all three countries are classified as developing countries,
their GDP per capita varied considerably from $9092 in Rus-
sia to $8027 in China and $697 in Rwanda [100].
Geographic region
Of 39 studies, one study (i.e. Alesina and colleagues) com-
pared Europeans to Americans [8] and found that the asso-
ciation between income inequality and SWB was stronger
among Europeans than Americans. A cross-national study

and SWB in 119 nations reported mixed findings: a nega-
tive association in the Western world (i.e. Western Euro-
pean countries, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand);
a slightly positive association in Eastern Europe, Asia and
Latin America (after controlling for wealth) and no associa-
tion in Africa [6]. Berg and Veenhoven [6] reported only the
overall association and did not report the quantitative data
supporting the negative association in Western countries or
either the positive or no association in other regions [6].
The way income inequality was operationalised (i.e.
exogenous Gini and endogenous Gini)
The majority of studies (n=26) used exogenous Gini (i.e.
extracted from nation-level data) and the remaining 13 stud-
ies used endogenous Gini (i.e. calculated from individuals'
responses). Studies that used endogenous Gini were longi-
tudinal studies and conducted in single countries such as
the UK, Russia, China and Poland, whereas studies using
exogenous Gini (n=18) were mainly cross-sectional. In
both groups, the studies have reported both negative and
positive associations between income inequality and SWB
regardless of whether the Gini coefficient was exogenous or
endogenous.
Metaanalysis of the association between income
inequality and SWB
Overall relationship between income inequality and SWB
Figure 2 presents the forest plot of the main analysis, namely
the overall relationship between income inequality and
SWB across the 24 studies that provided the relevant sta-
tistics. The overall pooled effect size was practically zero
and non-significant, suggesting that there is no association
between income inequality and SWB (pooled r=0.01, 95%
CI -0.08 to 0.06) and the heterogeneity between studies
was high (Q=563.10, I2=95.74%, p<0.001). As shown in
Fig. 2, the effect sizes of the individual studies included
in the meta-analysis differed considerably in direction and
magnitude. Sixteen studies reported a negative association
between income inequality and SWB, whereas eight studies
reported a positive association between income inequality
and SWB.
Results of the subgroup analysis
Country level of development Of 24 studies eligible for
the meta-analysis, 14 studies were conducted in developed
countries (e.g. USA) versus five studies conducted in devel-
oping countries (e.g. China). The pooled effect sizes across
studies based on populations from developed and develop-
ing countries were statistically significant in both groups
indicating that the relationship between income inequal-
ity and SWB does differ across developed and developing
countries (developed countries: pooled r=-0.06, 95% CI
-0.10 to -0.02; developing countries: pooled r=0.16, 95%
CI 0.09­0.23). The results of the Cohen's Q test confirmed
that the magnitude of the correlation was significantly nega-
tive among studies conducted in developed countries and
significantly positive among studies conducted in develop-
ing countries: Cohen's q=24.556, p
<
0.05 (See Fig. 3 in
Appendix 3 (Supplementary Material)).
Geographic region (USA vs. European countries) Of 24
studies eligible for the meta-analysis, three studies were
conducted in the USA versus seven studies conducted in
European countries. The pooled effect sizes in these two
regions (i.e. studies conducted in the European countries
and the USA) were statistically significant indicating a
negative association between income inequality and SWB
(European countries: pooled r
=
0.05, 95% CI -
0.09 to
-0.01; USA pooled r=-0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01)
(See Fig. 4 in Appendix 3 Supplementary Material).
SWB measures The meta-analysis involved eight studies
that used happiness to assess SWB versus 18 studies that
used life satisfaction to assess SWB. The main effect was
not influenced by type of SWB measures (life satisfaction:
pooled r=0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.10; happiness: pooled
r=-0.08, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.03) (See Fig. 5 in Appen-
dix 3 (Supplementary Material)).
Exogenous Gini versus endogenous Gini Of 24 stud-
ies eligible for the meta-analysis, the majority of studies
(n
=
18) used exogenous Gini, while the remaining six
studies used endogenous Gini. The pooled effect sizes
between studies that used exogenous Gini and studies that
used endogenous Gini were statistically non-significant
indicating that the relationship between income inequality
and SWB does not vary when exogenous or endogenous
Gini was used (exogenous Gini: pooled r=-0.02, 95% CI
-0.10 to 0.06; endogenous Gini: pooled r=0.03, 95% CI
-0.09 to 0.16) (See Fig. 6 in Appendix 3 (Supplementary
Material).
Discussion
The association between income inequality and SWB is
complex and highly dependent on methodological variations
across studies. The findings of this review do not support a
link between income inequality and SWB in general. Sub-
group analyses revealed that the association between income
inequality and SWB is significantly influenced by the coun-
try economic development. The association between income
593
Qual Life Res (2018) 27:577­596
1 3
inequality and SWB is significantly negative in developed
countries (pooled r=-0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.02)
but significantly positive in developing countries (pooled
r=0.16, 95% CI 0.09­0.23).
Nevertheless, the association between income inequality
and SWB was not influenced by (a) the measure used to
assess SWB (i.e. happiness and life satisfaction), (b) geo-
graphic region (i.e. studies conducted in the USA versus
studies conducted in the European countries) or (c) the way
income inequality was operationalised (i.e. exogenous Gini
vs. endogenous Gini).
How to interpret the exploratory findings?
Our findings suggest that the direction of the association
between income inequality and SWB differs between devel-
oped and developing countries. Differences in different pref-
erences for income inequality might explain this finding.
For example, the evolutionary modernisation theory [11, 58]
hypothesises differences in tolerance for income inequality
as economies move from developing to developed countries.
According to this theory [11, 58], people in developing
countries might perceive income inequality as an economic
opportunity or incentive to work, innovate and develop new
technologies and therefore as a more core determinant of
their well-being compared to developed countries. In con-
trast, technology, economic growth and innovation might
be taken for granted in developed countries, meaning that
income inequality may be perceived as a treat rather than a
challenge [11, 59]. Moreover, our findings do support the
"tunnel" effect theory suggesting that the rise of income ine-
quality may signal future mobility and an increase of SWB
[60]. The "tunnel" effect theory supports the idea that people
in developing countries may tolerate income inequality by
observing other people's increasingly rapid progression and
interpreting this evolution as a sign that their turn will come
soon [60, 61]. A study conducted in Poland found that when
an increase of income inequality was associated with growth
and when it was perceived to change rapidly, people were
more satisfied with their lives [39]. For example, Berg has
suggested that "income inequality is not necessary harmful
to well-being. Beja added that people may accept income
inequality when they see the possibilities to rise above their
current position" ([12], p. 153).
Research and social policy implications
The main contribution of this systematic review and meta-
analysis is that the country level of development influences
the link between income inequality and SWB: income ine-
quality is more likely to be a contributor to SWB in citi-
zens of developing countries than in developed countries.
Reducing income inequality could be a potentially fruitful
approach for governments and policy makers of developed
countries as a means of improving the SWB of their citi-
zens [11, 12]. The inverse association of SWB with income
inequality in developing countries suggests that income
inequality is more likely to be seen as job opportunities for
innovation in these countries. However, this review was only
based on cross-sectional studies and no causal inferences are
allowed; longitudinal studies are needed prior to forming
any causal links. The association between income inequal-
ity and SWB was not influenced by the measure used to
assess SWB, geographic region or the way income inequality
was operationalised. Our findings are in line with previous
research conducted in OECD countries suggesting no asso-
ciation between income inequality and SWB [9] "the best
evidence that we have to date is that redistribution beyond
the minimum for advanced societies does not enhance sub-
jective well-being/quality of life" ([9], p. 1107). Neverthe-
less, further studies are needed to understand the circum-
stances in which income inequality reduces SWB [3, 4, 62]
versus the circumstances in which income inequality is not
necessarily harmful to SWB [6, 12]. For example, extraor-
dinary circumstances such as the great recession may affect
how inequality is associated to subjective well-being. This
gap in knowledge is critical because some government and
policy makers still ask whether people care about income
inequality and if income inequality affects SWB. At present,
the evidence base is weak and cannot support strongly such
decisions. Most importantly, the present systematic review
highlights the need to produce a higher-quality evidence
base to support social and political decisions relating to
income inequality and SWB, both with respect to identify-
ing (a) what are the consequences of income inequality and
(b) what are the antecedents of SWB.
Strengths and limitations
This review has several strengths. First, the search was con-
ducted according to PRISMA published guidance [27]. Con-
sistent with the Cochrane guidance [16], the search strategy
comprised a thorough literature review, screening of refer-
ence lists and contacting authors for additional information.
Second, this is the first systematic review that investigated
the association between income inequality and SWB, and
therefore the findings of this review have the potential to
inform the literature in this area.
Nevertheless, it is important to recognise few key limita-
tions of this review. First, the preponderance of cross-sec-
tional studies means that it was impossible to establish a
temporal or causal relationship between income inequality
and SWB. Second, the poor reporting of data in combina-
tion with the use of different analytic approaches precluded
any firm conclusions about the direction and strength of the
association between income inequality and SWB. Future
594 Qual Life Res (2018) 27:577­596
1 3
studies are encouraged to concentrate on establishing an
initial correlation between income inequality and SWB
before embarking on multivariate analyses. Third, this study
investigated the relationship between income inequality and
SWB. Nevertheless, previous studies investigating people's
quality of life have reported a link between inequality, SWB
and health status [5, 9]. Further studies are needed to sys-
tematically investigate the association between income ine-
quality, SWB and health status [1, 2]. Finally, the majority
of studies included in this review were conducted in devel-
oped countries (N=14) and only five studies were conducted
in developing countries. This is problematic in terms of the
representativeness for the purpose of global decision-mak-
ing. More studies are needed to be performed in developing
countries. Due to limitations in the available data, we were
unable to compare Latin America to Europe or the USA
because only one Latin America country had data amenable
to meta-analysis. Social and political history may affect the
association between income inequality and SWB because
Inglehart et al. report that, with the same level of wealth,
Latin America is happier than their counterparts in Ex-Com-
munist nations [59]. We strongly encourage more methodo-
logically sound investigations to examine the association
between income inequality and SWB and to elucidate cur-
rent gaps and inconsistencies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this is the first systematic synthesis of the
literature regarding the link between income inequality and
SWB. The main finding of this review is that the association
between income inequality and SWB is complex. More rig-
orous investigations are needed to elucidate the link between
income inequality and SWB, and to identify what are the
antecedents and consequences of income inequality and
SWB taking into account the country development level.
