Abstract
The opportunity cost of the capital invested in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) to bring a new drug to
market makes up as much as half the total cost. However, the literature on the cost of pharmaceutical R&D is mixed on how,
exactly, one should calculate this "hidden" cost. Some authors attempt to adopt models from the field of finance, whereas
other prominent authors dismiss this practice as biased, arguing that it artificially inflates the R&D cost to justify higher prices
for pharmaceuticals. In this article, we examine the arguments made by both sides of the debate and then explain the cost
of capital concept and describe in detail how this value is calculated. Given the significant contribution of the cost of capital
to the overall cost of new drug R&D, a clear understanding of the concept is critical for policy makers, investors, and those
involved directly in the R&D.

Introduction
Innovation--the discovery of new ways to extract more
value out of limited resources--is a primary determinant of
our standard of living. Biopharmaceutical innovation is of
particular importance given the contribution of new drugs to
gains in longevity and health-related quality of life.1 Most
pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) is carried
out by for-profit companies. The primary function of these
companies is to translate biomedical knowledge, much of
which is generated in academic and public sector labs, into
new pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines. This involves drug
discovery, drug development, clinical testing, manufactur-
ing, and marketing. Pharmaceutical R&D--like other forms
of R&D--is not free; it is resource intensive. Moreover, drug
R&D is both risky and time-consuming. Many drug develop-
ment projects fail and there is a lag between expenditure out-
lays and the receipt of sales revenues for the drugs that
succeed.
There is a surprising amount of debate regarding the
resource cost of bringing a new drug to market. Widely
cited articles by DiMasi and colleagues measures the real
(inflation-adjusted) cost in the billions of dollars, and,
unfortunately, they find this cost is rising exponentially.2-5
Others place the cost orders of magnitude lower.6-10 There
are also suggestions that widely cited estimates of the cost
of new drug development are artificially inflated for politi-
cal reasons.11
Financing costs are a key component of the DiMasi cost
estimates and account for about half of total costs. These
financing costs, essentially interest on the money ("capital")
tied up during the lengthy and risky R&D process, are par-
ticularly contentious. DiMasi and colleagues use interest
rates ("cost of capital") as high as 11.5%.2,3 Some commen-
tators suggest that they are zero,11,12 whereas others are
ambivalent, but suggest that if there is a cost of capital, then
it is as low as 3%.6 The choice of interest rate has a dramatic
effect on the total cost of developing a new drug, given the
lag between the outlays on R&D and the point at which sales
revenues accrue. For instance, at 11%, a US$1 outlay accrues
about US$4 interest after 15 years, but only US$1 interest at
5% (Figure 1).
Given this controversy, our goal here is to adjudicate on
the debate, identify the arguments used by proponents on
either side of the debate and evaluate their claims, and finally
assess how the cost of capital is estimated.

What Is the Cost of Capital?
The cost of financing pharmaceutical R&D is the return
needed to entice funders to commit resources to pharmaceu-
tical R&D instead of other investments. The underlying idea
is that investors will only commit resources if they expect to
receive an amount that they can earn on other equally risky
investments. The amount that can be obtained elsewhere
constitutes the investor's "opportunity cost" of capital.
The notion of the opportunity cost of capital is widely
accepted within economics, although, as we discuss below,
the methods used to estimate its value are contested. But
some outside of economics, and even some economists
themselves, dispute the concept. In particular, the noted aca-
demic physicians Relman and Angell12 and Angell11 suggest
that there is no opportunity cost of capital because pharma-
ceutical firms "have no choice but to spend money on R&D
if they wish to be in the pharmaceutical business."11(p45) This
statement is correct, as far as it goes. But investors will pro-
vide funds to any venture only if they anticipate receiving
sufficient compensation for delaying consumption and incur-
ring the risk of potentially losing some or all of their capital.
Investors in pharmaceutical firms, that is, shareholders, only
wish to be in the pharmaceutical R&D business if they
receive as much in compensation as they do in other equally
risky ventures. Microeconomist David Friedman explains
the underlying theory (p. 205):
A steel mill cannot be converted into a drainage canal--but an
investor can decide whether he will use his savings to pay
workers to build the one or the other. So the anticipated return on
all investments--the interest rate--must be the same. If investors
expected to make more by investing a dollar in building a steel
mill than by investing a dollar in digging a drainage canal,
capital would shift into steel; the increased supply of steel would
drive down the price of steel and the return on investments in
steel mills. The reduced supply of capital in canal building
would, similarly, increase the return on investments in canals.
Investors would continue to shift their capital out of the one use
and into the other until the returns on the two were the same
(p. 205).13
It is instructive to assess the consequences to firms that
fail to generate sufficient returns. Drug companies can raise
funds to finance R&D projects from several sources. First,
they can use retained earnings, that is, gross profits generated
on sales of their existing drugs that are not returned to share-
holders in the form of dividends. Second, they can borrow
funds from lenders in the bond market. Third, the company
can sell stock that it itself holds, or issue new shares of the
company (diluting the value of existing shares). If firms are
unable to develop new drugs that drug plans and consumers
are willing to pay for, either from bad luck14-18 or incompe-
tence, then their pool of retained earnings will eventually dry
up. Lenders will be hesitant to lend money, or will demand a
substantial risk premium, if they perceive the default risk to
be high. The company's share price, a harbinger of future
profits, will decline, reducing the revenue potential from
selling new or existing stocks. Such a company will eventu-
ally go bankrupt or be at risk of takeover by another firm that
believes the company is being mismanaged. The firm pursu-
ing the takeover buys as much stock as possible, enough to
let it take over the company, fire most of its executives, and
install competent replacements. If the firm is successful,
earnings and the market value of the company's stock both
shoot up.13
Light and Warburton6 also take issue with the notion that
the opportunity cost of capital is a legitimate resource cost.
They write,
. . . experts argue that innovative companies must do R&D, and
this is a regular cost of doing business; so estimated profits
foregone should not be added to out-of-pocket costs . . . If
revenues are coming in from other products, then the [R&D]
costs are recovered as one goes along. (p. 8)
This argument again fails to recognize that retained earn-
ings, like other types of investment funds, have a variety of
valuable uses. If those with a claim to the retained earnings
(ie, shareholders) do not anticipate generating sufficient
gross profits from pharmaceutical R&D, they will move their
funds to other ventures. The secular decline in antibiotic drug
development is a telling illustration; this decline reflects, in
part, reduced anticipated sales revenues owing to antibiotic
stewardship initiatives on the part of prescribers and a com-
mensurate shift to other therapeutic classes.19,20
Light and Warburton6 further state, "Even if one were to
accept the argument that profits foregone should be included
as a `cost,' US government guidelines call for using 3 per
cent, not the 11 per cent used by DiMasi and colleagues."

(p. 164) Three percent might be the appropriate cost of capi-
tal for government, but the return required for private inves-
tors contemplating allocating funds to pharmaceutical
ventures is, as we discuss in further detail below, much
higher. Indeed, most studies place the private cost of capital
for the pharmaceutical industry to be 8% or higher.21
Estimating the Private Cost of Capital
How is a drug company's cost of capital estimated? One
must first determine how much of the company's operations
are financed by debt (capital from bondholders) versus
equity (capital from shareholders). The relative amounts of
debt and equity financing within a public company can be
ascertained by reviewing public financial reports, which by
law must disclose the relative amounts.
The opportunity cost of the two sources of funds is differ-
ent. The opportunity cost of debt is simply equal to the preset
interest rate agreed to between the corporation and its lenders
(bondholders). Shareholders face more variable returns than
lenders; there is no predetermined return on investments and,
in the event of insolvency, shareholders are paid last. To esti-
mate the opportunity cost of financing projects through
shareholder equity, the investment community relies on
financial models. Chief among these is the capital asset pric-
ing model (CAPM). The CAPM was developed by William
Sharp in 1964, and remains the dominant model today.22 The
key articles by DiMasi and colleagues all estimated the cost
of capital using this approach.
CAPM estimates the opportunity cost of investing in firm
i, also known as firm i's "cost of equity capital," as the sum
of the risk free rate of return (RFR), normally measured as
the return on US government bonds, and firm i's equity risk
premium. Formally, according to the CAPM, E(R
i
), the
expected cost of equity capital for firm i is
E R E
i
( ) = + ( )
( )
RFR RM RFR
i
 - .

i
, the "beta" for firm i, determines firm i's equity risk
premium; firms with larger beta values require larger returns.
Firm i's beta reflects the historical correlation between the
returns on firm i's shares and the returns from the stock mar-
ket as a whole. The expected market-wide return, E(RM), is
subject to undiversifiable risks, such as the risks that come
from macroeconomic downturns. If firm i's returns are
highly correlated with returns in the stock market as a whole,
then firm i's beta will be large. This would be the case, for
instance, if firm i produces a good or service whose sales are
particularly sensitive to macroeconomic shocks. A good
example is a firm that rents out construction equipment; such
a firm faces undiversifiable risks that are greater than that of
the stock market as a whole. Conversely, a firm with a beta
of zero means that the firm's share returns are completely
uncorrelated with the market returns. Sales of such a firm are
insulated from the market-wide systemic risk. Thus, in sum-
mary, a firm's cost of equity capital depends on the risk free
rate--the higher this is, the higher the opportunity cost to the
investor of assuming the risks of holding equities--and firm
i's equity risk premium, which measures the sensitivity of
firm i's returns to the market-wide systemic risks.
The forgoing describes the cost of equity capital for a par-
ticular firm. The cost of equity capital for an industry can be
estimated with the same formula, by weighting the individ-
ual firms' betas by the relative market value of each firm in
the industry. Beta statistics can also be calculated by sector.
Damodaran23 recently estimated the beta for the US health
care products sector as a whole as 0.99. Thus, health care
product suppliers have a risk profile that is close to the stock
market average. Pharmaceutical firms have betas that are
slightly higher, 1.03. Biopharmaceutical firm betas are 1.10.
Construction supply firms have betas of 1.60. Beta values for
public companies are routinely reviewed and updated for use
by investment portfolio managers and others in the financial
sector. These values are periodically published by various
financial reporting companies such as Thomson Reuters,24
Morningstar,25 and Bloomberg.26
The cost of capital that firm i faces is the weighted aver-
age of the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital.
The pharmaceutical industry relies almost exclusively on
equity capital,2-4,10 so the cost of capital for the industry mir-
rors the cost of equity capital. This is because, pharmaceuti-
cal firms specifically, and technology companies more
generally, contend with market imperfections that makes
borrowing unattractive to them.27 The problem is one of
information asymmetry between the pharmaceutical firm
and its potential lenders. Given the technical nature of phar-
maceutical technology, the firm will always have a better
grasp of the quality and riskiness of their projects than poten-
tial lenders. This causes lenders to ask for a premium above
what they would charge firms with a more lucid set of busi-
ness projects. The fact that very few pharmaceutical firms
take any debt at all indicates that the cost of debt is too high;
otherwise, many firms would take advantage and leverage
the expansion of operations and R&D through affordable
debt.
Of course, not all of the resources that the industry con-
sumes are financed privately. Governments also finance a
portion of industry-sponsored pharmaceutical R&D via tax
subsidies. And the cost of capital for government--estimated
to be in the range of 3% to 7% for developed countries28--is
lower than that for private companies. This government cost
of capital is essentially equal to the RFR described earlier.
Corporations and government contributed 57% and 39%,
respectively, of the total biomedical R&D spend in the
United States over the period 1999-2008, with the remaining
4% coming from charitable donations.29 Most of the govern-
ment support is focused on early-stage discovery R&D;
DiMasi3 suggests that tax credits contribute only a small
amount of the in industry directed R&D.
4 INQUIRY
What, then, are we to make of the cost of industry capital
estimates that account for about half of DiMasi and col-
league's estimated cost of bringing a new drug to market?
Our reading of the literature is that, if anything, these esti-
mates are conservative. The reason is that the CAPM model,
which was used to generate estimates of the pharmaceutical
industry cost of equity capital, tends to provide conservative
estimates. In particular, other models, which relax some of
the assumptions underlying the CAPM model, tend to pro-
duce higher cost of capital estimates. For instance, the lead-
ing competitor to the CAPM model, the Fama and French
(F-F) 3-factor model, considers company size and company
"health" beyond just what is included in CAPM. The F-F
model produces higher risk premia for smaller companies
and for companies that are judged to be in poor "health," as
measured by a relatively high book equity to market equity
ratio. Indeed, Vernon and colleagues have compared cost of
capital estimates using CAPM and F-F and found the latter
would produce higher costs of capital.30
As another example, Giaccotto et al relax another of the
CAPM assumptions, and again obtain higher estimates of the
cost of equity capital. The assumption they relax concerns
the unique time profile of sales revenues of pharmaceutical
firms, with sales growing over time until generic firms enter,
at which time sales drop markedly. The CAPM implicitly
assumes that sales follow a random walk. The authors find
that relaxing this assumption increases the cost of capital for
some pharmaceutical firms by as much as 2.8%.31
In conclusion, capital is a scarce resource and, like any
other scarce resource, there is an opportunity cost associated
with its use. The opportunity cost of capital invested in drug
discovery, development and commercialization is the return
required to compensate investors to invest in time-consum-
ing and risky R&D. There are standard methods in the field
of finance to produce estimates of the opportunity cost of
capital for various firms and sectors of the economy. The
pharmaceutical cost of capital estimates used by DiMasi and
colleagues are consistent with both economic theory and
financial accounting practice.
