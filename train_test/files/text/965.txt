Church-Based Social Support and Health in Old Age:
Exploring Variations by Race
Neal Krause
School of Public Health and Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan,Ann Arbor.
Objectives. A conceptual model is evaluated that explores the relationship between church-based support and health.
In the process, an effort is made to see if the relationships in this model differ for older White and African American
people.
Methods. Interviews were conducted with a national sample of 748 older White and 752 older Black people. The re-
sponses of 1,126 of these study participants are used in the analyses presented herein. Survey measures were adminis-
tered to assess church-based social ties and health.
Results. Empirical support was provided for the following theoretical linkages: Older people who attend church
often feel their congregations are more cohesive; older people in highly cohesive congregations receive more spiritual
and emotional support from their fellow parishioners; older respondents who receive more church-based support have a
more personal relationship with God; older people who feel more closely connected with God are more optimistic; and
older people who are more optimistic enjoy better health. Data further reveal that older Black people are more likely
than older White people to reap the health-related benefits of religion.
Discussion. The findings contribute to research on religion and health by specifying how the salubrious effects of
religion may arise.
convincing literature indicates that involvement in reli-
gion is associated with good health throughout adult
life [see Koenig, McCullough, & Larson (2001) for a review
of this research]. Initially, researchers working in this field
focused primarily on the relationship between basic as-
pects of religion, such as church attendance and health (Com-
stock, 1971). However, as this literature continued to evolve,
a greater emphasis was placed on explaining how the salu-
brious effects of religion may arise. For example, there has
been considerable interest in exploring how factors like
forgiveness (McCullough, Pargament, & Thoresen, 2000),
prayer (Levin & Taylor, 1997), and religious coping re-
sponses (Pargament, 1997) influence physical as well as
mental health. Viewed broadly, this work suggests that reli-
gion may affect health in not one, but a number of different
ways. As a result, it seems unlikely that researchers will be
able to develop a single comprehensive model that encom-
passes all the diverse ways in which religion may influence
health. Instead, it makes more sense to follow the pragmatic
approach outlined by Bradley and Schaefer (1998) in their
insightful discussion of causal modeling. These investiga-
tors maintain that because the social world is exceedingly
complex, researchers should strive to develop several models
that shed light on different facets of a larger underlying
social process.
Consistent with the recommendations of Bradley and
Schaefer (1998), the purpose of the present study is to exam-
ine one domain of religion that has not been fully exploited in
social gerontology--social relationships in the church. Al-
though several investigators have discussed race differences
in church-based support (Chatters, 2000), and the relation-
ship between social ties in the church and health (Krause,
Ellison, & Marcum, 2002), a number of key issues have yet
to be explored. In particular, some studies focus on adults of
all ages (e.g., Krause et al., 2002), making it difficult to gen-
eralize the findings to older people. In addition, a number of
investigators attribute the salutary effects of religious fac-
tors, such as church attendance, to church-based support,
but they never directly measure support exchanged by
fellow church members (e.g., Williams, Larson, Buckler,
Heckmann, & Pyle, 1991). Finally, few researchers have
empirically evaluated explicit conceptual models that at-
tempt to explain how the potentially beneficial influence of
church-based support may arise. Although some scholars
have provided useful theoretical discussions of how the ef-
fects of church-based support might operate (Ellison &
Levin, 1998), these conceptual schemes remain largely un-
tested. Consequently, the first goal of the present study is to
address this gap in the knowledge base by evaluating the re-
lationship between religious support and health in late life,
with an eye toward showing how the potentially beneficial
effects of church-based social ties may arise.
The second goal of this study is to delve more deeply into
church-based social relationships and health by exploring
the potentially important influence of race. More specifi-
cally, an emphasis is placed on seeing whether the church-
based social ties of older African Americans are stronger
than those of older White persons, and whether there are
race differences in the relationship between religious sup-
port and health. Some investigators argue that older African
Americans may receive more tangible and emotional assis-
tance in church than older White persons (Chatters, 2000),
but this literature may be improved in at least three ways.
First, few studies actually empirically assess race differences
A
RELIGION AND HEALTH S333
in church-based support. Instead, the argument for race
differences in religious support is based largely on theoret-
ical discussions alone. Second, researchers do not typi-
cally conduct explicit tests to see if the effects of church-
based support on health differ significantly for older White
and older Black people. Third, as the research that follows
will reveal, there are facets of religious support beyond
emotional and tangible assistance that have yet to be eval-
uated fully.
The discussion that follows is divided into three main
sections. First, a conceptual model is developed that at-
tempts to show why church-based social ties may be associ-
ated with good health in late life. In the process, race differ-
ences in this conceptual scheme are explored. Second, the
sample and study measures are presented. The data analytic
strategy is briefly examined at this juncture as well. Finally,
the study results are reviewed and discussed.
Church-Based Social Support and Health
The latent variable model that was developed for this
study is presented in Figure 1. Two steps were taken to sim-
plify the presentation of this conceptual scheme. First, the
elements of the measurement model (i.e., the factor loadings
and measurement error terms) are not shown in Figure 1. Sec-
ond, the relationships among the constructs in this model
were evaluated after the effects of age, sex, education, and
race were controlled statistically. The central theoretical
thrust of this conceptual scheme is captured in the following
linkages: (1) Older people who attend church more often
will tend to believe their congregations are highly cohesive;
(2) those who worship in more cohesive congregations will
receive more spiritual and emotional support from their fel-
low church members; (3) older people who receive spiritual
and emotional support from the people in their church will
develop a deeper and more personal relationship with God
(i.e., connectedness with God); (4) older study participants
who feel they are closely connected with God will maintain
a strong sense of optimism; and (5) older people who are
more optimistic will enjoy better health than elderly people
who are less optimistic. The theoretical rationale for these
linkages is discussed in detail herein.
Church attendance, congregational cohesiveness, and
spiritual support.--As House (1987) observed some time
ago, social support is rarely treated as a dependent variable.
Yet a deeper understanding of how social support operates
should begin by showing how it arises in the first place. The
model in Figure 1 was designed to address this issue by as-
sessing the interplay between the frequency of church atten-
dance and the wider social climate of the congregation.
According to the model depicted in Figure 1, church at-
tendance may affect religious support in two ways. First, it
is hypothesized that older adults who attend church more
often will receive more support from church members than
older people who do not attend religious services frequently.
This may happen for a number of reasons. For example, fre-
quent contact may make potential providers more aware of
the social support needs of older church members.
The second way that church attendance may influence re-
ligious support is more indirect and operates through the
wider social climate of the church. A longstanding principle
in sociology stipulates that the behavior of people in institu-
tions, such as churches, is influenced by the wider climate
of these social organizations. This view is captured in the
classic work of Berger and Luckmann (1966), who maintain
that, "Institutions . . . by the very fact of their existence,
control human conduct by setting up predefined patterns of
conduct, which channel it in one direction as against the
many other directions that are theoretically possible" (p.
55). Although this proposition appears to be relatively
straightforward, it is challenging to evaluate because there
are a number of ways to conceptualize and measure institu-
tional influences on behavior. Several researchers have at-
tempted to delineate different facets of religious institutions
that shape the behavior of people who worship there. One of
the more comprehensive studies was conducted by Parga-
ment and colleagues (1983). These investigators proposed
that the climate of a congregation is determined by a range
of factors, including the stability of church leadership, the
level of autonomy and openness in church meetings and
committees, and the extent to which church members are in-
volved in church activities. Their research revealed that cer-
tain facets of the congregational climate (e.g., the level of
autonomy) were associated with greater self-esteem and life
satisfaction. Although these investigators made a valuable
contribution to the literature, their work can be improved in
at least three ways. First, the study by Pargament and col-
leagues was based on a nonrandom sample of adults from
all age groups. This makes it difficult to determine whether
the findings may be generalized to older people. Second,
psychological well-being was the major outcome measure
in this study. As a result, it is not clear if the climate of the
congregation may be related to physical health status as
well. Third, Pargament and colleagues did not make an ef-
fort to evaluate empirically the ways in which the climate of
the congregation may influence the physical or mental
health of people who worship there.
In an effort to extend the work of Pargament and colleagues
(1983), the model depicted in Figure 1 focuses on one facet of
Figure 1. A conceptual model of church-based support and self-
rated health.
S334 KRAUSE
the wider congregational climate--congregational cohesive-
ness. This construct reflects the extent to which church
members believe their values and outlook on life are shared
by the people they worship with. Focusing on this particular
facet of the congregational climate makes it possible to
specify the second way in which the frequency of church at-
tendance may be associated with religious support. More
specifically, it is proposed in Figure 1 that older people who
attend church more often tend to believe that their congrega-
tions are more cohesive, and older people who are embedded
in more cohesive congregations will, in turn, receive more
support from their fellow church members. The work of
Stark and Finke (2000) helps explain the first of these link-
ages. These investigators begin by pointing out that when
people attend religious services, they engage in various ritu-
als. The purpose of these rituals is to enhance group solidar-
ity by increasing commitment to the ideals, goals, and
values of the church. To the extent this is true, more frequent
attendance in worship services should promote greater con-
gregational cohesiveness. In contrast, the link between con-
gregational cohesiveness and social support is based on a
large body of secular research, which suggests that social
support is more likely to be exchanged when social net-
works are homogeneous and network members share com-
mon values and beliefs (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook,
2001).
Research on the predictors of church-based support is
complicated by the fact that church members are likely to
help each other in a number of different ways. For example,
research reviewed by Chatters (2000) suggests that people
often receive emotional and tangible assistance from the
people they worship with. This is important because an ex-
tensive literature suggests that various types of support pro-
vided in secular settings (e.g., emotional support or tangible
help) may have a beneficial effect on health (Cohen, Under-
wood, & Gottlieb, 2000). However, research conducted in
church settings indicates that people may also help each
other in ways that are more explicitly religious in nature.
More specifically, research by Krause, Ellison, Shaw, Mar-
cum, and Boardman (2001) indicates that fellow church
members may exchange spiritual support as well. Spiritual
support is assistance that is aimed specifically toward in-
creasing the religious commitment, beliefs, and behavior of
a fellow parishioner. There are a number of ways in which
church members may exchange spiritual support. For exam-
ple, they may share their own religious experiences with a
fellow parishioner, or show them how to apply their reli-
gious beliefs in daily life.
Although it is not possible to include all the different di-
mensions of church-based support in a single conceptual
model, two are evaluated in Figure 1--emotional support
and spiritual support provided by church members. Com-
paring and contrasting the effects of these constructs is use-
ful for the following reason. Although measures of emo-
tional and spiritual support from church members are
correlated (Krause et al., 2001), these types of church-based
assistance may serve different functions. Spiritual support is
much more focused in nature and is typically provided to
enhance the religious experience and understanding of the
recipient. In contrast, emotional support from church members
is more general and is often provided to promote an overall
sense of well-being in the recipient and augment the quality
of the relationship between the provider and the recipient. If
church-based support is associated with health in old age,
then knowing which facet of support is at work may help re-
searchers better understand the underlying mechanisms that
may be at work.
Church-based support and connectedness with God.--
A number of studies indicate that individuals tend to be-
come more religious as they grow older. For example, when
compared with people under 30 years of age, considerably
more people over age 75 say religion is very important to
them (i.e., 77% vs. 45%; Ehmann, 1999). Similarly, re-
search by Levin and Taylor (1997) indicates that the fre-
quency of private prayer steadily increases in successively
older cohorts. These empirical insights are consistent with
the theoretical perspective developed by Fowler (1976),
who outlined a series of stages that people go through in the
development of their faith. He argued that, as individuals
progress through these developmental stages, the quality
and nature of their faith tends to deepen and mature. For ex-
ample, the final stages in his scheme are characterized as a
time of deep critical introspection, in which commitment to
one's faith broadens and takes on a greater significance. It is
especially important to note that Fowler argued that these
final stages of development are typically encountered later
in life.
Consistent with the perspective of Fowler (1976), Koenig
(1994) identified the qualitative changes that take place in
the religious orientation of some people as they enter in old
age. The essence of these changes is captured in Koenig's
notion of a mature religious faith. In particular, he maintains
that a ". . . mature religious faith involves a deep, intimate,
stable, and exclusive relationship with God" (Koenig, 1994,
p. 124). If this is true, then researchers need to learn more
about the factors that promote a deep personal relationship
with God. A central premise in the present study is that fel-
low church members may play a critical role in this process.
In particular, it is proposed that spiritual support received
from fellow parishioners helps older people feel as though
they are more closely connected with God, and that they
have a deep personal relationship with Him. This is hardly a
new idea. Nearly a century ago, Simmel (1905) maintained
that a religious person, ". . . feels himself bound to a univer-
sal, to something higher, from which he came and into
which he will return, from which he differs and to which he
is nonetheless identical. All of these emotions, which meet
as in a focal point in the idea of God, can be traced back
to the relationship that the individual sustains with the
species . . ." (p. 372).
As Simmel's (1905) observations reveal, all close ties
with others are capable of generating these feelings toward
God. To the extent this is true, emotional support may be as-
sociated with feeling close to God as well. However, it is
predicted in this study that spiritual support will have a
greater effect because, as noted earlier, this type of church-
based support is focused more specifically on enhancing the
nature and quality of religious life.
Wuthnow (1994) conducted one of the few empirical
RELIGION AND HEALTH S335
studies on the relationship between social ties in the church
and the development of a close personal relationship with
God. Consistent with the hypothesis developed for the present
study, Wuthnow found that people who are encouraged by fel-
low church members to adopt religious teachings and prin-
ciples tend to report they have a closer relationship with
God. However, Wuthnow did not examine whether having a
close personal relationship with God was, in turn, related to
health. Moreover, because he studied adults of all ages, it is
not clear if his findings can be generalized to older people.
Connectedness with God and optimism.--If religion is
related to health in late life, and having a close personal re-
lationship with God is the hallmark of a mature faith, then it
is imperative to find out how a close relationship with God
may influence the health of older people. Although there are
likely to be a number of pathways, one potentially important
mechanism is examined in Figure 1. In particular, it is pro-
posed that older people who have a close personal relation-
ship with God have better health because being closer to
God helps them feel more optimistic. Optimism is defined
as the expectation or confidence that outcomes that are de-
sired for the future will ultimately be attained (Peterson,
2000). Optimism is very closely akin to hope (Snyder,
2000). Although some investigators go to great lengths to
discuss the differences between the hope and optimism
(Nunn, 1996), it is not the purpose of the present study to re-
solve this issue. Instead, the literature on both hope and op-
timism is considered below because, despite the conceptual
distinction between these constructs, the two constructs ap-
pear to be correlated highly (e.g., around 0.60; Snyder et al.,
1991).
There are two reasons why optimism and hope are espe-
cially important factors to examine within the context of re-
ligion. First, as Peterson (2000) argues, "Religious thought
lends itself particularly well to . . . optimism because of
its certainty" (p. 51). Second, as Levin (2001) points out,
". . . every religion seeks to instill hope in those who sub-
scribe to its teachings" (p. 138). Consistent with these views,
Koenig and colleagues (2001) reviewed a series of studies
that link various aspects of religiousness with greater opti-
mism and hope. However, most of this work was conducted
in clinic settings with adults of all ages who were suffering
from diseases like cancer or HIV. Consequently, it is diffi-
cult to generalize the findings to the general population of
older people. Sethi and Seligman (1993) conducted one of
the few studies on optimism and religion that did not in-
volve respondents who were recruited from a clinic setting.
These investigators report that adults of all ages who feel re-
ligion has a greater influence in their daily lives, and who
are more involved in religion, tend to feel more optimistic.
Although optimism may be related to religion in general,
it is important for the purposes of the present study to show
why it may arise specifically from a close personal relation-
ship with God. Evidence for this relationship may be found
by returning to Koenig's (1994) discussion of a mature faith.
In particular, he argued that people who have a close rela-
tionship with God develop a deep sense of trust in God, be-
lieve that God is in control of their lives, believe that God
knows what is best for them, and believe that God ultimately
ensures they will get what they need most. Because of these
beliefs, Koenig maintained that people who have a close
personal relationship with God are more hopeful and more
optimistic.
Optimism and health.--There are a fairly substantial
number of studies in the secular literature on the relation-
ship between optimism and physical as well as psychologi-
cal well-being. One study by Peterson, Seligman, and
Vaillant (1988) is especially compelling. Their research
suggests that optimism is a significant predictor of physical
health status over a 35-year period. In particular, this study
revealed that people who are optimistic tend to enjoy better
health over time than individuals who are less optimistic.
Similarly, research reveals that people who are hopeful also
tend to have better physical health [see Lazarus (1999) for a
review of this literature]. There are at least three reasons
why optimism and hope may exert a beneficial effect on
health. First, there is some evidence that people who are op-
timistic tend to cope more effectively with stressful life
events. In particular, a strong sense of hope or optimism is a
motivating factor that encourages individuals to take active
steps to eradicate the problems they face (Lazarus, 1999).
Second, optimism or hope is thought to imbue life with a
deep sense of meaning (Levin, 2001). This is important be-
cause research indicates that having a strong sense of mean-
ing in life is associated with better health (Ryff & Singer,
1998). Finally, hope and optimism may lower the risk of
mental health problems (Nunn, 1996) that may, in turn, in-
fluence physical health (Cohen & Rodriguez, 1995).
Although the secular literature on hope, optimism, and
health is fairly well developed, empirical research on these
relationships in religious settings is more limited. In one of
the more noteworthy studies, Idler and Kasl (1997) found
that the frequency of church attendance is associated with
greater optimism and that older people who are more opti-
mistic tend to experience fewer problems with physical
functioning over time. Consistent with the findings of Idler
and Kasl, it is predicted in Figure 1 that older adults who are
more optimistic will report their health is better than elderly
people who are less optimistic.
Race Differences
The model depicted in Figure 1 is useful because it serves
as an important strategic context for adding to the burgeon-
ing literature on race differences in religion during late life.
As noted earlier, a considerable number of studies reveal
that older Black people are significantly more involved in
religion than elderly White people. In one of the more com-
prehensive studies, Levin, Taylor, and Chatters (1994) ex-
plored race differences in religion across four national sur-
veys. Race comparisons were made on 21 indicators of
religion across these different data bases. The findings re-
vealed that older Black people were more religious than
older White people in 19 of the 21 tests. For example, when
compared with elderly White people, older Black persons
attend church more often, read religious books more often,
and feel that religion is more important in their lives. The
model depicted in Figure 1 aims to contribute to this litera-
ture in two ways. First, it expands the scope of inquiry by
S336 KRAUSE
exploring whether race differences emerge in variables that
have not been examined by other researchers (i.e., congre-
gational cohesiveness, spiritual support, emotional support,
and connectedness to God). Second, an effort is made to see
whether race differences emerge in the relationships be-
tween these measures of religion and health.
Social factors figure prominently in the model depicted in
Figure 1 (e.g., congregational cohesiveness and spiritual
support). This emphasis is important because research con-
sistently shows that the social aspects of religion may be
more well developed among older Black than elderly White
people. Evidence of this may be found in the classic study
of the black church by DuBois (2000). Writing in 1887, he
concluded that, "The Negro church . . . provides social inter-
course, it provides amusement of various kinds, it serves as
a newspaper and intelligence bureau, it supplants the the-
ater, it directs the picnic and excursion, it furnishes the mu-
sic, it introduces the stranger to the community, it serves as
a lyceum, library, and lecture bureau--it is, in fine, the cen-
tral organ of the organized life of the American Negro" (p.
21). Although the observations of DuBois were made over a
century ago, more recent evidence suggests that religion
among Black people continues to have a pronounced so-
cial emphasis. This is reflected in the work of Mattis and
Jagers (2001), who noted that, ". . . African American re-
ligiosity and worship traditions emphasize both a pro-
found sense of intimacy with the divine, and a horizontal
extension of that intimacy into the human community . . ."
(p. 523).
There are both historical and cultural reasons for the de-
cidedly social emphasis in religion among older Black
people. With respect to history, a number of researchers
maintain that the church became the social center of the
community because of centuries of discrimination and prej-
udice. In particular, Black people turned to the church for
social as well as spiritual sustenance because it was the only
institution in the community that was built, funded, and
wholly controlled by Black people (Nelsen & Nelsen,
1975). In addition to historical factors, there is some evi-
dence that cultural issues may also come into play. Baldwin
and Hopkins (1990) have gone to great lengths to identify
the key elements of the African American worldview or cul-
ture. They persuasively argue that African American culture
is characterized by its emphasis on harmony, cooperation,
collective responsibility, "groupness," and "sameness." Be-
cause institutions reflect the elements of the wider culture in
which they are embedded, it follows that these key cultural
characteristics should permeate religion in the Black com-
munity as well.
Based on the research reviewed previously, it is hypothe-
sized that, compared with older White people, older Black
people will report their church congregations are more co-
hesive. Evidence for this may be found in Pargament's study
on the climate of religious congregations (Pargament et al.,
1983). These investigators found that, on average, African
American congregations appear to have a more favorable
climate than White congregations. In addition to this, the
cultural and historical factors identified previously suggest
that, compared with older White people, older Black per-
sons will report receiving more emotional and spiritual sup-
port from their fellow parishioners. But race differences in
the social aspects of religion may extend beyond relation-
ships among people to the relationships that older adults
maintain with God. As noted earlier, Mattis and Jagers
(2001) maintain that a special emphasis is placed in African
American religiosity on developing an intimate relationship
with God. Support for these observations may be found in a
qualitative study of 50 older Black women by Black (1999).
Her research revealed that, "God is regarded as a personal
friend who knows each woman intimately and cares for her
particularly" (Black, 1999, p. 359). Similar conclusions were
reached in another qualitative study by Poindexter, Linsk,
and Warner (1999). Cast within the context of the model de-
picted in Figure 1, this research suggests that older Black
people will report they feel more closely connected to God
than their White counterparts.
In addition to these predominantly social factors, race dif-
ferences may also emerge in hope or optimism. Research in
Black theology by Cone (1986) suggests that because of ra-
cial repression in the United States, African American reli-
giosity is deeply concerned with issues of oppression, and
the quest for liberation and justice. Because of the centrality
of the church in the Black community, and because the
church meets issues of racism head on, Black theologians
have argued that one of the most important functions of the
church is to instill a sense of hope and optimism among the
faithful (Cone, 1986). Based on this literature, it is hypothe-
sized in Figure 1 that older Black people will be more opti-
mistic than older White people.
So far, the discussion in this section has focused on how
race differences may arise in various dimensions of religion.
But it is important to think more deeply about how these
race differences may become manifest. The research re-
viewed previously suggests that the level or amount of reli-
gious involvement may be higher among older Black people
than among older White people. So, for example, Black
people may receive more spiritual support than White
people. If spiritual support is, in turn, related to health, it
would be reasonable to conclude that religion is more likely
to benefit older Black people because they are more in-
volved in it. This scenario would reflect the salubrious ef-
fects of differential involvement in religion across the two
racial groups. These race differences could be detected by
testing for mean differences in constructs, like spiritual sup-
port. Alternatively, differential involvement could be cap-
tured by estimating the relationship between race and spiri-
tual support. But there is another way to think about the
relationships among race, religion, and health that is more
subtle in nature.
Subsequent data analysis may reveal that the relationship
between church-based support and health is stronger among
older Black people than among elderly White people. This
effect would be captured by assessing whether the regres-
sion coefficient for the relationship between spiritual or
emotional support and health differs across subgroups con-
sisting of older White and older Black people. If the sub-
group coefficients are different, it is important to think care-
fully about what these findings mean. In this case, the
estimates would reveal that, at the same level or amount of
support, the impact of church-based assistance on health is
RELIGION AND HEALTH S337
greater for older Black than older White people. This differ-
ential impact of church-based support on health would sug-
gest there is something qualitatively different about the na-
ture of the social support process across the two racial
groups. This unmeasured influence could involve a number
of factors, including the cultural or historical influences re-
viewed earlier in this section. For example, research in the
secular support literature suggests that the benefits of re-
ceiving assistance from others are enhanced if both the sup-
port provider and the support recipient possess good social
skills (Hogg & Heller, 1990). Perhaps the social emphasis in
the African American worldviews discussed by Baldwin and
Hopkins (1990) helps ensure that, at comparable levels of
exposure, older Black people will be more likely than White
people to reap the health-related benefits of receiving
church-based support because their culture has provided
them with more well-developed social skills.
In the analyses that follow, two sets of analyses are used
to disentangle the potential contributions of variations by
race in the differential involvement and differential impact
of religion in late life. Doing so helps sharpen our under-
standing of the precise processes that may shape race differ-
ences in the relationship between religion and health.
METHODS
Sample
Data for this study come from a nationwide survey of
older people. The study population was defined as all house-
hold residents who are either Black or White, noninstitu-
tionalized, English speaking, and 66 years of age or older.
Geographically, the study population was restricted to eligi-
ble persons residing in the coterminous United States (i.e.,
residents of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded). Finally, the
study was restricted to individuals who were currently prac-
ticing Christians, people who were Christians in the past but
no longer practice any religion, and individuals who were
not affiliated with any faith at any point in their lifetime.
People who practiced a religion other than Christianity (e.g.,
Jews and Muslims) were excluded because it would be ex-
tremely difficult to devise a comprehensive set of religion
measures that are suitable for persons of all faiths.
The sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons con-
tained in the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA)
Medicare Beneficiary Eligibility List (HCFA is now called
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). This list
contains the name, address, sex, and race of virtually every
older person in the United States. It should be emphasized
that older people are included in this list even if they are not
receiving Social Security benefits. Nevertheless, some older
people are not included in this database because they do not
have a Social Security number. This may be from factors
such as illegal immigration.
A five-step process was used to draw the sample. First,
each year, researchers at HCFA draw a 5% sample of the
names in their master file using a simple random sampling
procedure. The sampled names include individuals who are
at least 65 years of age. However, by the time the field pe-
riod for the present study began, subjects in the 5% file were
at least 66 years of age. It is for this reason that the study
population was defined as including individuals who were
66 years of age or older. In the second step of the sampling
procedure used for this study, the 5% file was split into two
subfiles--one containing older White people and the other
containing older Black people. Each file was sorted sepa-
rately by county and then by zip codes within each county.
In the third step, an nth interval was calculated for each sub-
file based on the total number of eligible records. Following
a random start, 75 nth selections were made in each file. In
the fourth step of the sampling strategy, primary sampling
units (PSUs) were formed by selecting approximately 25
additional names above and 25 additional names below each
case identified in step three. Finally, in the last stage, sam-
pled persons within each PSU were recruited for an inter-
view with the goal of obtaining approximately 10 complete
interviews per PSU.
Interviewing began in March 2001 and concluded in Au-
gust 2001. Data collection was performed by Louis Harris
and Associates (now Harris Interactive). A total of 1,500 in-
terviews were completed successfully. Older Black persons
were oversampled so that sufficient statistical power would
be available to explore fully race differences in religion.
More specifically, the final sample consisted of 748 older
White and 752 older Black people. The overall response rate
for the study was 62%.
Although there are 1,500 participants in this study, all re-
spondents are not included in the analyses presented herein.
The model depicted in Figure 1 focuses on congregational
cohesiveness and church-based support. However, people
must attend church to have an opportunity to build close ties
with the people who worship there. Consequently, when the
study questionnaire was designed, the research team con-
cluded that it did not make sense to ask about things like
congregational cohesiveness and receiving spiritual support
from church members if people either never go to church, or
attend worship services only once or twice a year. Based on
this rationale, 374 study participants are excluded from the
analyses because the questions dealing with congregational
cohesiveness and church-based support were not adminis-
tered to them.
A preliminary analysis of the data provided by the 1,126
eligible study participants revealed that the proportion of
cases containing missing data ranged from 0% to 16%, with
only two variables containing more than 8% item nonre-
sponse. Using listwise deletion of missing data would have
resulted in 734 cases with complete data. However, to avoid
potential bias arising from item nonresponse, multiple im-
putation procedures were performed using the software de-
veloped by Schafer (1997). More specifically, the model
depicted in Figure 1 was estimated in each of three com-
plete data sets containing imputed values. Coefficients were
then averaged across the three imputations to generate a sin-
gle point estimate. Following this, standard errors were cal-
culated by using a formula that combines the average of the
squared errors of the estimates and the variances of the pa-
rameter estimates across the three samples (Schafer & Olsen,
1998). Based on these imputation procedures, the analyses
performed herein were conducted with 1,126 cases.
Approximately 46% of the study participants were older
White people, and 54% were older African Americans. The
S338 KRAUSE
average age of these individuals was 74.4 years (SD  6.3
years). Approximately 38% were older men. Finally, these
older adults indicated they had successfully completed an
average of 11.6 years of schooling (SD  3.4 years). These
descriptive data, as well as the results presented herein, are
based on weighted data. More specifically, data within the
subsamples of older White and older Black people were
weighted to information on age, gender, education, and re-
gion of the country (East, South, Midwest, West) contained
in the May 2001 U.S. Census Bureau Current Population
Statistics data file.
Measures
Table 1 contains the measures that were used to estimate
the model depicted in Figure 1. The procedures used to code
these items are provided in the footnotes of this table.
Frequency of church attendance.--A single item was
used to determine how often study participants attended reli-
gious services in the past year. This indicator is coded so that
a high score represents more frequent church attendance.
Congregational cohesiveness.--Three items were de-
veloped especially for this study to assess congregational
cohesiveness. The extensive strategy that was implemented
to develop these questions is discussed in detail by Krause
(2002). As shown in Table 1, these indicators assess whether
respondents feel their beliefs and values are shared by the
people they worship with, and whether people in their con-
gregation tend to have a similar outlook on life. These mea-
sures are coded so that a high score denotes greater congre-
gational cohesiveness.
Spiritual support.--Spiritual support received from fel-
low parishioners is also measured with three indicators that
were developed especially for this study. These items assess
whether fellow church members share religious experiences
with study participants, and whether fellow parishioners
help them lead a better religious life. A high score on these
measures indicates that respondents receive spiritual sup-
port more often from the people they worship with.
When these items were being developed, it quickly became
evident that church members can provide spiritual support in
two different contexts. First, as the work of Wuthnow (1994)
reveals, people may provide spiritual support in formal
church settings, such as Bible study groups, prayer groups,
and formal worship services. Second, spiritual support may
also be provided informally, because people interact with their
fellow parishioners inside, as well as outside, the church. As
shown in Table 1, the spiritual support questions devised for
this study reflect assistance that was provided only in infor-
mal settings. The decision to focus on informal support was
based on the following rationale. When the item develop-
ment strategy for this study was being implemented, many
study participants indicated that they considered sermons
during formal worship services and collective congrega-
tional prayers to be a source of spiritual support. However,
expanding the scope of inquiry to include these formal con-
texts tends to blur the boundaries between social support,
formal worship services, and prayer. This creates problems

RELIGION AND HEALTH S339
because an extensive literature reveals that formal worship
services (Idler & Kasl, 1997) and prayer (Levin & Taylor,
1997) are complex social phenomena that may influence
health in a number of ways that do not explicitly involve so-
cial support. As a result, it is harder to isolate the specific
contributions of church-based support when it is provided in
formal settings. To more clearly identify the underlying fac-
tors that may be at work, participants in the present study
were instructed to exclude assistance obtained in Bible
study groups, prayer groups, and formal worship services
when answering the spiritual support questions.
Emotional support from church members.--Three indi-
cators were used in this study to assess the amount of emo-
tional support that older people receive from their fellow
church members. These questions are revised versions of
church-based emotional support items that were devised by
the Fetzer Institute/National Institute on Aging Working
Group (1999). As shown in Table 1, these items ask older
respondents whether someone in their congregation told
them they love and care for them, whether someone they
worship with listened to them talk about their private feel-
ings and concerns, and whether a fellow church member
expressed interest or concern in their well-being. These
indicators are coded so that a high score denotes more emo-
tional support. In the process of answering these questions,
respondents were instructed not to include emotional sup-
port from their minister, pastor, or priest. This was done be-
cause research by Krause and associates (2001) suggests
that emotional support from the clergy and emotional sup-
port from fellow church members are not related to other
facets of religion (i.e., religious coping responses) in the
same way.
Connectedness with God.--Three measures were also
devised specifically for this study to assess connectedness
with God. These indicators gauge whether respondents feel
they have a close personal relationship with God, whether
they feel God is right there with them in daily life, and
whether they believe God actually listens when they talk to
Him. A high score on these items indicates that study partici-
pants feel they have a close and personal relationship with God.
Optimism.--Optimism is measured with three indica-
tors. Two come from the scale developed by Scheier and
Carver (1985). These items assess whether study partici-
pants expect the best in uncertain times and whether they
are optimistic about the future. The third item deals with
feeling confident that the rest of one's life will turn out well.
This item was based on the input of respondents in our qual-
itative research (Krause, 2002). More specifically, a number
of study participants indicated their faith made them feel
more optimistic about the future, and they specifically noted
that their religion made them feel that, no matter what hap-
pened in the future, things would turn out well. All three indi-
cators are coded so that a high score denotes greater optimism.
Self-rated health.--Health is measured with a single
item that asks respondents to rate their overall health as
either excellent, good, fair, or poor (see Idler, 1999, for a de-
tailed discussion of the utility of this measure). This widely
used indicator is coded so that a high score reflects better
self-rated health.
Race.--A binary variable is used to contrast older White
people (scored 1) with older Black people (scored 0).
Demographic control measures.--The relationships be-
tween race, religion, optimism, and health were evaluated
after the effects of age, sex, and education were controlled
statistically. Age is scored in a continuous format. Similarly,
education is coded in a continuous format reflecting the
total number of years of completed schooling. Finally, sex is
represented by a binary variable that contrasts men (scored
1) with women (scored 0).
Data Analysis Strategy
The analyses for this study were conducted in two parts
that were designed to test for differential involvement in re-
ligion between older Black and White people, as well as the
differential impact of religion across the two racial groups.
The analyses that focus on differential involvement in reli-
gion are relatively straightforward. In this case, older Black
and older White respondents are pooled to form a single
group. Then, tests are performed to see if the binary mea-
sure contrasting members of the two racial groups is signifi-
cantly related to the constructs depicted in Figure 1. These
analyses were performed with Version 8.50 of the LISREL
statistical software program (du Toit & du Toit, 2001).
The model depicted in Figure 1 was evaluated with the
maximum likelihood estimator. However, use of this proce-
dure rests on the assumption that the observed indicators in
the model are distributed normally. Preliminary tests of the
study measures (not shown here) revealed that this assump-
tion had been violated. Fortunately, as du Toit and du Toit
(2001) report, this problem can be handled by simply con-
verting raw scores on the observed indicators to normal
scores prior to model estimation (see p. 143). Based on this
recommendation, all analyses presented in this study are
based on variables that have been normalized.
In contrast with analysis of differential involvement in re-
ligion, tests for the differential impact of religion are more
complex. As discussed previously, the differential impact
perspective states, for example, that the relationship be-
tween congregational cohesiveness and spiritual support is
stronger among older Black than older White people. Stated
in more technical terms, this perspective specifies that there
is a statistical interaction effect between race and congrega-
tional cohesiveness on spiritual support. Tests for this, as
well as all other interactions by race, were performed using
a subgroup approach. Once again, these analyses are con-
ducted with Version 8.50 of the LISREL software program
(du Toit & du Toit, 2001). Cast within the context of the
present study, subgroup analysis involves partitioning the
sample into two separate groups consisting of older White
and older Black people, respectively. Then, two models
identical to the one depicted in Figure 1 are created for each
subgroup. These models are then estimated simultaneously.
But, instead of making a single pass through the data, a se-
ries of nested models are used to test for race differences in
S340 KRAUSE
the hypothesized study linkages. These nested models are
important because they evaluate assumptions in the mea-
surement model, as well as substantive race differences in
the relationships among the latent constructs. The series of
nested models that were performed in this study are listed in
Table 2.
The first specification in Table 2 (Model 1) allows all the
parameters in the models to vary freely across the two sub-
groups. This provides the baseline for evaluating the utility
of the remaining models. The next two models (Models 2
and 3) are designed to see if the elements of the measure-
ment model are the same in subgroups consisting of older
White and older Black people, respectively. These tests are
important for the following reason.
If study measures mean the same thing to older White and
older Black people, they will answer survey questions in
the same way. If they answer the questions in the same way,
the covariances among these items should be the same in
both groups. To the extent this is true, the factor loadings
and measurement error terms derived from these covari-
ances should be the same as well. However, if the elements
of the measurement model differ across groups, then there
would be some evidence that measures of constructs like
congregational cohesiveness and spiritual support do not
mean the same thing to older White and older Black people.
If this proves to be the case, it would be difficult to interpret
substantive race differences in the model. This issue is
known as the problem of factorial invariance (Bollen, 1989).
It is important to conduct tests for factorial invariance be-
cause the wide majority of studies on race differences in
religion overlook this fundamental measurement issue.
Tests for factorial invariance are performed in two steps.
First, the factor loadings are constrained to be equivalent in
the two groups (Model 2). If this equality constraint does
not change the fit of the model to the data significantly (as
reflected in change in 2 values), it is left in force when the
next model is estimated. Model 3 tests a higher order, more
restrictive, form of measurement equivalence. In particular,
the measurement error terms associated with the observed
indicators are constrained to be equivalent across groups.
Once again, if this constraint does not change the fit of the
model to the data significantly, it is left in place when the next
model is evaluated.
Following tests for factorial invariance, the next step in-
volves assessing whether there are race differences in the
substantive relationships among the constructs shown in
Figure 1. This is done in two steps. First, all the relation-
ships among all the latent variables in Figure 1 are simulta-
neously constrained to be equivalent across groups (Model
4). This test is not unlike the overall F test in ordinary least-
squares multiple regression analyses. The intent is to avoid
capitalizing on chance by making a single pass through the
data to see if any of the substantive relationships differ for
older White and older Black people. If the fit of the model to
the data deteriorates because of this comprehensive equiva-
lence constraint, then it is permissible to conduct additional
tests to see precisely where race differences arise. This latter
series of tests (not shown in Table 2) involves working sys-
tematically through the model to see if each individual link-
age differs across the two racial groups. So, for example,
one test would involve constraining just the parameter esti-
mate for the relationship between congregational cohesive-
ness and spiritual support to be equivalent across groups.
RESULTS
Differential Involvement in Religion
The findings from the analyses that were designed to ex-
amine the differential involvement perspective are presented
in three sections. First, the fit of the pooled latent variable
model to the data is examined. Following this, the psycho-
metric properties of the study measures are assessed. Fi-
nally, the substantive findings are reviewed.
Fit of the model to the data.--Data indicate that the fit
of the latent variable model in Figure 1 to the data was
good. More specifically, the Bentler-Bonett Normed Fit In-
dex (NFI; Bentler & Bonett, 1980) estimate of 0.969 is
above the recommended cutpoint of 0.900. Similarly, the
standardized root mean square residual estimate of 0.025 is
below the recommended ceiling of 0.050 (Kelloway, 1998).
Finally, the Bollen's (1989) Incremental Fit Index (IFI)
value of 0.978, as well as the Tucker-Lewis coefficient
(Tucker & Lewis, 1973) estimate of 0.967, are quite close to
the ideal target value of 1.0 for these indices.
Psychometric properties of the observed indicators.--
Table 3 contains the factor loadings and measurement error
terms that were derived from estimating the model in Figure
1. These coefficients are important because they provide
preliminary information about the psychometric properties
of the study measures. Although there are no firm guidelines
in the literature, experience suggests that factor loadings in
excess of 0.400 indicate that observed indicators tend to
have reasonably good reliability and validity. As the data in
Table 3 reveal, the factor loadings range from 0.607 to
0.932, suggesting that the measures used in this study have
adequate psychometric properties.
Although the factor loadings and measurement error
terms associated with the observed indicators provide useful
information about the reliability of each item, it would be
helpful to know something about the reliability of the scales
taken as a whole. Fortunately, it is possible to compute these
estimates with a formula provided by Rock, Werts, Linn,
and Jöreskog (1977). Applying this formula to the data in
Table 3 yields the following reliability estimates for the
composite measures in this study: Congregational cohesive-
ness (.830), spiritual support (.817), emotional support

(.808), connectedness to God (.917), and optimism (.803).
As these estimates reveal, the reliability of the main study
measures is good. These reliability estimates are reassuring
because they provide one way of demonstrating that the
time-consuming item development strategy followed in this
study was justified (Krause, 2002).
Substantive findings.--Table 4 contains estimates of the
substantive relationships among the constructs depicted in
Figure 1. Consistent with the differential involvement hy-
pothesis, data reveal that older Black people are more
deeply involved in religion than older White people. More
specifically, the findings reveal that, compared with older
Black people, older White people report that their congrega-
tions are less cohesive (  .103; p  .001). Moreover,
older White people indicate that they receive less spiritual
support (  .223; p  .001) and less emotional support
from church members (  .201; p  .001) than older
African Americans. Data further suggest that, compared
with older Black people, older White people do not feel as
closely connected to God (  .117; p  .001). In con-
trast, no significant race differences were found in church
attendance (  .017; not significant). This would ini-
tially appear to contradict the work of other investigators
(e.g., Levin et al., 1994). However, it should be recalled that
persons who never attend church or who attend worship ser-
vices once or twice a year have been excluded from the
present analyses. In fact, had these individuals been included
in the analyses, then the anticipated relationship between
race and church attendance would have emerged from the
data (a table containing the results of these findings is avail-
able from the author).
In addition to race differences in religion, data further
reveal that there are race differences in optimism as well.
Consistent with the theoretical rationale developed for this
study, the findings indicate that older White people are less
optimistic than older African Americans (  .173; p 
.001). Finally, the data suggest that older White people tend to
rate their health slightly better than older Black people ( 
.087; p  .01).
The findings also provide support for the theoretical ratio-
nale embedded in Figure 1. More specifically, the results
suggest that older adults who attend church frequently are
more likely to believe their congregations are highly cohe-
sive than older people who do not go to church as often ( 
.245; p  .001). Data further indicate that the wider social
atmosphere of the congregation, in turn, tends to influence
the amount of church-based support received by older adults.
More specifically, greater congregational cohesiveness is as-
sociated with receiving more spiritual support (  .377; p 
.001) and more emotional support from one's fellow parish-
ioners (  .306; p  .001). The results in Table 4 also re-
veal that greater spiritual support is, in turn, associated with
feeling more closely connected with God (  .156; p 
.001). But, in contrast, emotional support from fellow
church members is not related significantly to feeling con-
nected closely with God (  .069; not significant). Taken
together, these results suggest that it is explicitly religious
support that promotes closeness with God and not more
general feelings of emotional closeness with fellow church
members. These results underscore the importance of as-
sessing multiple dimensions of social support in the church.
Returning to Table 4, data further indicate that older people
who feel close to God tend to be more optimistic (  .247;
p  .001). Finally, as the theoretical rationale developed for
this study specifies, older people who are more optimistic
indicate their health is better than older people who are less
optimistic (  .138; p  .001).
Taken as a whole, data reviewed up to this point provide
support for the differential involvement perspective. In par-
ticular, the results suggest that older African Americans are
more involved in religion than older White persons, and
people who are more involved in religion tend to have better
health. At the heart of this specification lies the simple no-
tion that older Black people may derive greater health-
related benefits from religion because they are more in-
volved in it.
Differential Impact of Religion
The results of the analyses that assess the differential im-
pact perspective are presented below in two sections. First,
findings from tests of the nested subgroup models are pre-
sented. Second, substantive race differences in the relation-
ships among the study measures are reviewed.
Nested model tests.--Select goodness-of-fit measures

(model 1) to the data is acceptable. More specifically, the
Bentler-Bonett NFI (Bentler & Bonett, 1980) estimate of
.947, the standardized root mean square residual estimate of
.030, Bollen's (1989) IFI value of .976, and the Tucker-
Lewis coefficient value of .964 (Tucker & Lewis, 1973) are
all close to their respective target values.
The first test of factorial invariance (see Model 2) indi-
cates that constraining the factor loadings for older White
and older Black people to be equivalent did not change the
fit of the model to the data significantly. Evidence of this
may be found by examining the change in chi-square values
from Model 1 to Model 2 (2  6.002 with 10 degrees of
freedom is not significant). It may, therefore, be concluded
that the factor loadings are invariant across groups, and the
equality constraint is left in place as Model 3 is tested.
The test of Model 3 reveals that the measurement error
terms associated with the observed measures are not invari-
ant across groups. More specifically, the change in fit from
Model 2 to Model 3 is statistically significant (2 change 
97.756 with 15 degrees of freedom is significant at the .001
level). Viewed in conjunction with the tests for Model 2,
these results indicate that the factor loadings are invariant,
whereas the measurement error terms are not. Although it
would have been preferable to find that all elements in the
measurement model are invariant, Reise, Widaman, and Pugh
(1993) argue that achieving even partial invariance is ac-
ceptable and that meaningful subgroup comparisons can be
made even if only some of the factor loadings are invariant
across groups. Because all the factor loadings in the present
study are the same across groups, it is concluded that the
measures used in this study are sufficiently invariant to war-
rant further examination of substantive race differences in
the relationship between religion and health in late life.
Returning to Table 5, the next step in the nested model
testing strategy involved exploring whether all the substan-
tive relationships among the measures shown in Figure 1 are
the same for older White and older Black people (see Model
4). As the findings in Table 5 reveal, one or more of the rela-
tionships among the substantive measures differ signifi-
cantly by race. In particular, the change in chi-square values
(41.272 with 20 degrees of freedom) was significant at the
.01 level. Following this, 20 separate tests were constructed

to determine where specific race differences emerge. The
findings from these analyses are not presented in Table 5,
but a table containing the goodness-of-fit estimates from
these individual tests can be obtained from the author.
The tests for race differences in the substantive relation-
ships among the constructs in Figure 1 reveal that only 3 of
20 relationships differ significantly across the subgroups.
Based on the analyses conducted up to this point, a final
model was estimated in which the factor loadings and the 17
invariant substantive relationships were constrained to be
equivalent across groups (2  480.505 with 287 degrees of
freedom). Estimates provided by the NFI (.945; Bentler &
Bonnet, 1980), the IFI (.977; Bollen, 1980), the Tucker-
Lewis coefficient (.969; Tucker & Lewis, 1973), and the
standardized root mean square residual index (.034) all sug-
gest that the fit of this final model to the data was good.
Substantive race differences.--Because only 3 of 20 re-
lationships in Figure 1 were found to vary across groups
comprising older White and older Black people, tables con-
taining the results of these subgroup analyses are not pro-
vided in this article. Instead, data are provided for only
those instances in which statistically significant race differ-
ences emerged in the analyses. However, tables containing
the full subgroup study findings may be obtained from the
author. Two sets of estimates will be presented when re-
viewing the subgroup differences in the model. Standard-
ized estimates are typically of interest when working with
variables like congregational cohesiveness because these
measures have no inherent nature metric. However, it is dif-
ficult to compare typical standardized estimates across sub-
groups because differences in the variances of the latent
constructs may become confounded with differences in the
substantive relationship between the latent variables across
subgroups. To make direct comparisons of standardized co-
efficients possible, the LISREL software program provides
common metric standardized estimates, which are based on
pooled variances. It is for this reason that the first set of esti-
mates to be examined consists of common metric completely
standardized estimates. The second set of estimates that are
provided are unstandardized regression coefficients.
The first substantive race difference in Figure 1 involved
the relationship between church attendance and feeling
closely connected to God. The findings reveal that the rela-
tionship between church attendance and feeling more
closely connected to God is stronger in the subgroup con-
sisting of older White people (common metric completely
standardized estimate  .252; b  .071; p  .001) than the
subgroup comprising older African Americans (common
metric completely standardized estimate  .059; b  .017;
not significant). The difference between the unstandardized
estimates in each subgroup is significant at the .01 level. At
first glance, this may appear to be at odds with the theoreti-
cal rationale provided earlier. However, it is important to
consider these effects within the context of the wider con-
ceptual model. The relationship examined previously rep-
resents the direct effect of church attendance on feeling
closely connected with God. But, as shown in Figure 1,
church attendance may also influence feeling close to God
indirectly through congregational cohesiveness, spiritual
support, and emotional support. Therefore, to get a more
comprehensive view of the relationship between church at-
tendance and feelings of connectedness with God, the direct
effects must be examined in conjunction with the indirect
and total effects. Unfortunately, the LISREL software pro-
gram does not provide common metric completely standard-
ized estimates for indirect and total effects. Therefore, con-
ventional standardized estimates must be used for this
purpose. As discussed previously, there are drawbacks in re-
lying on these coefficients. However, as the findings that fol-
low reveal, they still provide useful insights into the nature
of the relationships among race, church attendance, and
connectedness with God. Further analysis of the subgroup
data reveal that the indirect effect of church attendance on
connectedness with God for older White people is:  
.108; p  .001. The total effect for White people is:  
.336; p  .001. In contrast, the indirect effects of church at-
tendance on feeling closely connected to God for older Afri-
can Americans is:   .141; p  .001. The corresponding
total effect for older Black people is:   .209; p  .001.
Viewed more generally, the total effects reveal that
church attendance is related to feeling more closely con-
nected with God among both older Black and older White
people. However, older Black people who attend worship
services often feel closer to God solely because of the indi-
rect effects that operate through the key social factors in the
model (i.e., congregational cohesiveness, spiritual support,
and emotional support). This is consistent with theoretical
discussions that highlight the pronounced social underpin-
nings of religion in the Black community (Chatters, 2000). In
contrast, the social aspects of worship services also influence
whether older White people feel close to God; but, above and
beyond this, some other unmeasured factor(s) that is not in
the model has an influence as well (i.e., this is captured by
the direct effect for older White people). However, it is diffi-
cult to identify these unmeasured influences because the lit-
erature is not sufficiently developed at this time.
The second substantive race difference in the model de-
picted in Figure 1 involved the relationship between church
attendance and optimism. Data reveal that older Black
people who attend church services frequently tend to be
more optimistic (common metric completely standardized
estimate  .116; b  .032; p  .05). In contrast, frequent
church attendance is associated with a slight decline in opti-
mism among older White people (common metric com-
pletely standardized estimate  .096; b  .027; p 
.05). The difference between these estimates is significant at
the .01 level. It is not surprising to find that frequent church
attendance is associated with greater optimism among older
Black people. Attending church services represents a time
when Black people become immersed in their own culture
and associate with other Black people who share common
life experiences, as well as similar cultural and religious
values. Having these feelings and beliefs shared and vali-
dated in a context that is free of discrimination and preju-
dice may prove to be an especially important source of
shared racial pride, hope, and optimism. In fact this is one
reason why McRae and colleagues (1998) describe Black
churches as "therapeutic systems."
It may, however, be less evident why more frequent church
S344 KRAUSE
attendance is associated with less optimism among older
White people. Two points may help bring the finding involv-
ing older White people into sharper focus. First, the size of
the direct effect is fairly modest (.096). Second, and more
important, further insight may be found by considering the
indirect and total effects that operate through the model.
More specifically, data indicate that the indirect effect of
church attendance on optimism for older White people is:
  .160; p  .001. When this is coupled with the direct ef-
fects, the resulting total effect is not significant (  .060;
not significant). In contrast, the indirect and total effects for
older black people are   .102; p  .001 and   .214;
p  .001, respectively. Viewed more generally, the total ef-
fects for older White and older Black people suggest that at-
tending church bolsters the optimism of older Black people,
but not older White people. Casting the findings in this way
helps bring the results in line with current thinking about
race differences in religion and optimism.
The final substantive race difference to emerge from the
subgroup analyses involved the relationship between con-
gregational cohesiveness and spiritual support. Consistent
with the theoretical rationale provided earlier, data suggest
that the relationship between congregational cohesiveness
and spiritual support is stronger for older Black people
(common metric completely standardized solution  .443;
p  .001) than older White people (common metric com-
pletely standardized solution  .316; p  .001). The differ-
ence between these estimates is significant at the .05 level.
These specific race differences aside, it is important not to
lose sight of the wider pattern of findings that have emerged
across this entire study. Tests of the differential involvement
perspective indicate that older Black people appear to be
more involved in religion than older White people. In con-
trast, race differences emerged in only 3 of 20 relationships
in the subgroup analyses, suggesting that the differential im-
pact perspective figures less prominently in explaining race
differences in religion and health in late life.
DISCUSSION
Although many researchers believe that religion is associ-
ated with health, this view is not shared by all in the aca-
demic community. In their scathing critique of the literature,
Sloan, Bagiella, and Powell (1999) focused primarily on
methodological problems to call into question research on
the religion-health connection. Although sound research
methods are obviously important for establishing causal re-
lationships, there is more to it than this. In their thought-
provoking discussion, Bradley and Schaefer (1998) argue
that finding a cogent theoretical rationale for describing the
causal mechanisms that are at work is just as important as
tending to the methodological prerequisites of causality.
The research in the present study was guided by this ratio-
nale. In particular, a thorough item development strategy
and rigorous data analytic procedures were combined with a
well-articulated, conceptual model to outline one way in
which religion may be related to the health of older people.
Developing a compelling theoretical rationale for this
study was not easy. With insights provided by the founders
of sociology, a model was crafted that took social relation-
ships in the church as a point of departure (Durkheim, 1915;
Simmel, 1905; Weber, 1922), but the work of these grand
social theorists was hard to adapt because they did not pro-
pose explicit causal linkages that could be easily operation-
alized and subject to rigorous empirical scrutiny. To deal
with this problem, a conceptual model was developed that
was based on theoretical discussions in traditional sociol-
ogy, findings from empirical studies, and the insights pro-
vided by the older men and older women who participated
in the qualitative phase of this study (Krause, 2002). This
conceptual scheme boldly underscores the social basis of re-
ligion and health in late life. This model began by recogniz-
ing that relationships among individuals in the church are
shaped by the frequency of attendance at worship services,
and the larger social climate of the congregation. In the pro-
cess, an effort was made to select constructs that are espe-
cially salient in late life (i.e., connectedness with God) and
that are uniquely religious in nature (i.e., spiritual support).
Consistent with classic views on the social underpinnings
of religion, it was proposed that people who attend church
more often will report that their congregations are more
highly cohesive, and that congregations that were highly co-
hesive would be more likely to provide spiritual and emo-
tional support to the people who worship there. The model
further specified that older people who receive more church-
based support tend to develop a closer and more personal re-
lationship with God, and that connectedness with God is, in
turn, related to optimism. Finally, more optimistic people
were hypothesized to enjoy better health. Empirical assess-
ment of this conceptual scheme provided support for these
linkages. However, there was one notable exception.
Data suggest that spiritual support is related to feeling
close to God, but emotional support from church members
failed to exert a statistically significant effect. In fact, church-
based emotional support was not associated with any of the
constructs that come after it in the model (i.e., closeness to
God, optimism, and health). Therefore, within the confines
of the model developed for this study, the findings suggest
that the health-related benefits of church-based support may
be primarily associated with spiritual support provided by
fellow church members.
There are four reasons why this research is noteworthy.
First, there do not appear to be any studies on religion that
have gone to such lengths to devise carefully crafted mea-
sures that are designed specifically for use with older people
[see Krause (2002) for a discussion of this item develop-
ment strategy]. Second, data come from a nationwide sam-
ple of older adults, making it possible to generalize the find-
ings to a wider population than is typically studied in
research on religion in late life. Third, this is the first time
that a number of constructs contained in the study model
have been linked to health in samples consisting of older
people (e.g., congregational cohesiveness, spiritual support,
and connectedness with God). Finally, race differences were
carefully probed in the study model. Two contrasting views
were evaluated to specify more clearly how the relationship
between religion and health may differ for older White and
older Black people: The differential involvement perspec-
tive and the differential impact perspective. Fairly pro-
nounced race differences emerged from the findings. How-
ever, the weight of the evidence clearly appeared to favor
RELIGION AND HEALTH S345
the differential involvement view--older Black people may
be more likely to reap the benefits afforded by religion be-
cause they are more involved in it. This appears to be the
first time in the literature that a set of invariant measures
have been used to evaluate race differences in the social as-
pects of religion and health with a large national sample of
older White and older Black people.
Although the analyses produced a number of new insights,
the conceptual model was relatively straightforward. As a re-
sult, those wishing to pursue some of the ideas proposed in
this study might begin by developing models that flush out
various aspects of the theoretical rationale in greater detail.
For example, a model might be crafted to explore more fully
how individuals come to believe that people in their congrega-
tion share their values, beliefs, and outlook on life. Church
size was described earlier, but testing for denominational dif-
ferences might also provide valuable insight. More specifi-
cally, it might be useful to see if more fundamentalist denomi-
nations tend to be more cohesive than denominations with a
more mainline or liberal perspective (Stark & Finke, 2000).
Researchers might also pursue other ways to estimate the ef-
fects of congregational cohesiveness. For example, it might be
helpful to interview a number of people in the same congrega-
tion and analyze their responses to congregational cohesive-
ness measures within a multilevel, data analytic framework.
Additional models might be devised to explicitly assess
why connectedness with God may foster and maintain an
older person's sense of optimism. Earlier, the work of
Koenig (1994) was used to argue that closeness to God arises
from several factors, including whether a person believed
that God was in control of his or her life. However, the rela-
tionships among connectedness to God, control by God, and
optimism were not examined empirically. It may be impor-
tant to examine these relationships in the future.
Finally, to arrive at a better understanding of the potential
health-related benefits of church-based support, it is impor-
tant for researchers to compare and contrast support from
fellow parishioners with assistance obtained in secular set-
tings (e.g., support from neighbors or friends who are not
religious). Although disentangling secular and sacred sup-
port is likely to pose significant challenges (Krause, 2001),
this work is important because it will help researchers deter-
mine whether there is something truly unique about reli-
gious support or whether it merely reflects the influence of
a largely secular process that happens to be taking place
within the context of a particular organization.
In the process of exploring ways to expand the model that
was devised for the present study, it is important to keep the
limitations of this study in mind. Four limitations are re-
viewed briefly herein.
First, data for this study were gathered at a single point in
time. Consequently, the temporal ordering among the study
constructs was based on theoretical considerations alone. As
a result, the proposed causal ordering could be reversed by
arguing, for example, that receiving more spiritual support
promotes the belief that one's congregation is more cohe-
sive. Clearly, this as well as other causal assumptions that
are embedded in the study model should be rigorously eval-
uated with data that have been collected at more than one
point in time.
Second, with the exception of church attendance and the
demographic control variables, the measures used in this
study call for subjective evaluations of religion and health.
The fact that these measures are correlated may be inter-
preted in two ways. One view, which is reflected in the
model depicted in Figure 1, specifies that these correlations
reflect underlying causal processes. So, for example, it is
proposed that spiritual support leads older people to feel
closer to God. But a second interpretation of these correla-
tions is possible. Instead of reflecting causal processes, the
correlations among the subjective measures may capture
the influence of what Diener and associates (2000) call dis-
positional positivity. This means that some individuals have
a propensity to evaluate various facets of life in a good way,
and that this disposition operates over and above more ob-
jective influences. Cast within the context of the present
study, this means that older people may rate spiritual sup-
port favorably and closeness to God favorably not because
the former causes the latter, but because these evaluations
reflect a general underlying tendency to view things in more
positive ways. There is no clear way to resolve this issue at
the present time, but it should be kept in mind as the find-
ings from this study are reviewed.
Third, health was assessed in the present study with a sin-
gle self-reported item. Although this indicator is used fre-
quently in research, greater insights into the nature of reli-
gion and health may be obtained if researchers examine
other health outcomes, such as physical functioning or spe-
cific chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension). Moreover, using
more traditional biomedical markers of health (e.g., blood
pressure measurements) would add further credibility to the
connection between religion and health in late life.
Fourth, as the work of Wuthnow (1994) reveals, people
can receive significant spiritual support from formal
groups in the church, such as Bible study and prayer
groups. However, when spiritual support was evaluated in
the present study, the respondents were instructed not to
include spiritual support obtained from these formal
groups. Clearly, a high priority for the future is to com-
pare and contrast the effects of support obtained from for-
mal church groups with support received informally from
fellow church members.
Religion is an incredibly vast conceptual domain that
contains a bewildering number of facets or dimensions. As a
result, it is difficult to identify, measure, and analyze all the
ways in which religion may be related to health. This chal-
lenge was recognized many years ago by James (1902/
1997), when he wrote his classic treatise on religion. In par-
ticular, he argued that, "The divine can mean no single qual-
ity, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions
of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy
missions . . . So a `god of battles' must be allowed to be the
god for one kind of person, a god of peace and heaven and
home, the god of another. We must frankly recognize the
fact that we live in partial systems, and that parts are not in-
terchangeable in spiritual life" (James, 1902/1997, p. 509).
When viewed at the broadest level, the greatest contribution
of the present study may arise from the fact that it provides
useful procedures and templates to help other investigators
frame their approach to studying the challenging, but
S346 KRAUSE
greatly rewarding, relationship between religion and health
in late life.
