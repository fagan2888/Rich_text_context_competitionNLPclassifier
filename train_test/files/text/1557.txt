THE PLACE OF DEATH OF AN IN-
fant, child, or adolescent who
has lived with a medically
complex chronic condition
(hospital, home, or elsewhere) may be
shifting over time. If so, what factors
influence the place where these chil-
dren die?
A growing body of evidence sug-
gests that for pediatric patients who die
of terminal illnesses, the location at the
time of death has important implica-
tions. In addition to many pediatric pal-
liative care clinicians attesting that
"home is almost always the preference
of the child, who can be in familiar sur-
roundings,"1 when care is provided in
the home setting, parental satisfaction
with care appears to be greater,2 and
subsequent adaptation and outcomes
for parents and siblings may be im-
proved.3,4 Additionally, the delivery of
end-of-life care at home may also re-
flect the nature of preceding medical
communication and decision making.
In studies of children who died of
cancer, earlier parental understanding
regarding the child's prognosis of no re-
alistic chance for cure has been asso-
ciated with a greater likelihood of death
occurring at home.5,6
Three interrelated developments
make questions regarding the place of
death timely and germane.7,8 First, ad-
vances in hospital-based pediatric medi-
cal and surgical care are enabling more
children to survive longer with what
previously were swiftly lethal condi-
tions, with the likely result that the
prevalence of children living with life-
threatening conditions is increasing, but
to an unknown degree.9-11 Second, the
broadening use in the home setting of

Context The place where children with complex chronic conditions are dying may
be shifting toward residential homes due to the evolving epidemiology of life-
threatening childhood conditions, advances in home-based medical technology, and
changes in attitudes about pediatric palliative care and hospice services.
Objectives To determine whether pediatric deaths attributed to complex chronic con-
ditions are increasingly occurring in the home and to assess race and ethnicity dispari-
ties in the location of death.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective national-level case series drawn
from the National Center for Health Statistics' Multiple Cause of Death Files spanning
1989-2003. Participants included all deceased individuals aged 19 years or younger
with a complex chronic condition excluding injury and noncomplex chronic condi-
tions (as classified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision).
Main Outcome Measure Place where death occurred.
Results Among the 22.1% of deaths (198 160 of 896 509 total deaths) attributed
to a complex chronic condition between 1989 and 2003, the percentage of individu-
als dying at home increased significantly (P.001) over time for infants (aged 1 year)
(4.9% in 1989 and 7.3% in 2003); 1- to 9-year-olds (17.9% and 30.7%); and for 10-
to 19-year-olds (18.4% and 32.2%). Adjusting for decedent characteristics, the odds
of dying at home increased significantly each year (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence
interval, 1.03-1.04) and were reduced among both black and Hispanic decedents (odds
ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.52 and odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confi-
dence interval, 0.50-0.54, respectively) compared with white decedents.
Conclusions Children who die with underlying complex chronic conditions increas-
ingly are dying at home. Racial and ethnic disparities regarding place of death may
represent important limitations and opportunities for improvement in the current sys-
tems of pediatric chronic and palliative care.

regimens and technologies, ranging
from complex polypharmacy to me-
chanical ventilators, may be increas-
ing the residential population of medi-
cally fragile children who at any given
moment are at an increased risk of
death.12,13 Third, recent efforts to fa-
cilitate the delivery of pediatric pallia-
tive care or hospice may be enabling a
larger percentage of terminally ill chil-
dren to be cared for at home.14 In com-
bination, these 3 trends might be con-
tributing to an increase in the number
of deaths occurring at home, whether
unexpected or anticipated.
Whereas a variety of studies have ex-
amined the place of death for adults who
died due to medical diseases,15-29 popu-
lation-level data regarding the place of
death for children and young adults are
thus far limited to 2 published studies.
In Wisconsin between 1992 and 1996,
of the 1538 infants whose deaths were
attributed to either congenital anoma-
lies or conditions of the perinatal pe-
riod, 62 (4%) died at home.30 In Wash-
ington State between 1980 and 1998,
among children who died with an un-
derlying complex chronic condition,the
placeofdeath(especiallyforinfants)was
predominantly the hospital but an in-
creasingpercentageweredyingathome,
rising to 41% among the children who
diedaftertheirfirstbirthday.31 Addition-
ally, this study found that a decedent's
race and ethnicity, the geographic loca-
tionoftheirhome,andthelocalarealevel
of income all affected the likelihood of
achilddyingathome,withpoorer,black,
and Hispanic children being more likely
to die in the hospital than at home.31 If
confirmedtobeamoregeneralphenom-
enon, a significant shift in the site of
death from the hospital to home (result-
ing from some combination of unex-
pected and anticipated deaths) would
present several challenges to health care
practiceandpolicy.Inbothinstances,en-
suring that children living with life-
threatening diseases are receiving high-
quality care--whether this care seeks
cure, life extension, or palliation--is im-
perative.
We conducted a retrospective
national-level case series of all deaths
attributed to a complex chronic con-
dition that occurred before the dece-
dents' 20th birthday in the United States
between 1989 and 2003. We specifi-
cally sought to test the hypothesis that
the percentage of complex chronic
condition-related deaths occurring at
home increased over the 15-year ob-
servation period.
METHODS
Data Sources and Variables
The Children's Hospital of Philadel-
phia Committee for the Protection of
Human Subjects reviewed and ap-
proved the conduct of this study. We
used National Center for Health Sta-
tistics Multiple Cause of Death Files
compiled from national death certifi-
cate data for all deaths between 1989
and 2003, restricted to only those in-
dividuals who died between birth and
their 20th birthday. The files included
data regarding decedents' age (classi-
fied as birth to 1 year, 1-9 years, 10-19
years), sex, race (classified as white,
black, or other), Hispanic ethnicity,
state of residence (classified into the 4
major geographic regions defined by the
US Census), underlying cause of death
identified with International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
(1989-1998) or ICD-10 (1999-2003)
codes, and place of death (reclassified
into 3 major categories of home resi-
dence; hospital, clinic, or medical cen-
ter; and all other places). Data regard-
ing place of death were excluded for
2622 decedents who died with under-
lying complex chronic conditions in
either of 2 states during the years 1989-
1990 or 1 state during the years 1989-
1996 because of concerns regarding
coding of the place of death. For the
2.2% of decedents in the sample who
were missing data regarding Hispanic
ethnicity, we imputed the missing val-
ues on the basis of a multivariate tech-
nique (implemented using the Stata-
basediceandmicombineprograms32,33),
fitting a sequence of 5 regression mod-
els that imputed the missing value and
combining the resulting data sets to per-
form the regression models described
in "Statistical Analyses."
Case Selection and Classification
Complex chronic conditions were de-
fined as medical conditions that can be
reasonably expected to last at least 12
months (unless death intervenes) and
that involve either several different or-
gan systems or 1 organ system se-
verely enough to require specialty pe-
diatric care and probably some period
of hospitalization in a tertiary care
center. To identify whether an indi-
vidual died from a complex chronic
condition, we used our previously
published classification scheme based
on ICD-9 codes, which assigns diag-
noses to 1 of 9 categories: neuromus-
cular, cardiovascular, pulmonary, re-
nal, gastrointestinal, hematologic/
immunologic, metabolic, malignancy,
and genetic/other congenital defect con-
ditions.31,34 For those individuals who
died during 1999-2003 and had ICD-10
codes listed for the underlying cause of
death, we recoded the ICD-10 codes as
ICD-9 codes and then classified the
cases into complex chronic condition
categories.
We were able to make 2 assessments
of these classification procedures using
the 1996 Multiple Cause of Death File,
whichwaspreparedforpublicusebythe
National Center for Health Statistics, in
order to contain for each decedent both
ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes for the under-
lying cause of death and up to 15 addi-
tional secondary diagnoses.35 Using this
file, we first assessed the adequacy of
using only the single ICD-9 code listed
as the underlying cause of death to clas-
sifycases.Comparedwithusingallavail-
able primary and secondary cause of
death codes, the single underlying cause
of death detected 96% of the decedents
withcomplexchroniccondition-related
deaths. Given this high level of detec-
tion,weperformedallanalysesusingthe
underlying cause of death ICD code as
the basis of classification of a dece-
dent's complex chronic condition sta-
tus. Next, we compared for each dece-
dentinthe1996MultipleCauseofDeath
File the complex chronic condition
assignment based on the ICD-9 and
ICD-10 underlying cause of death codes,
with 99% agreement of the assignment

condition categories.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted using
Stata/MP 9.2 statistical software (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Tex). First, the
absolute counts and proportions of
deaths that occurred at the sites of in-
terest were examined and tested for
trends using univariate logistic regres-
sion, regressing the occurrence of home
death on the year of death and exam-
ining the significance of the coeffi-
cient for the year of death, which we
modeled as a continuous variable.
Next, a multivariable logistic regres-
sion model was constructed with selec-
tion of covariates based on the authors'
prior research,31 specified a priori to
include year of death, age at death, sex,
race, Hispanic ethnicity, type of com-
plex chronic condition (using malig-
nancy as the referent), and geographic
location of the home (using the North-
eastasthereferent).Thefinalmodeldem-
onstrated a pseudo-R2 value of 0.16 and

Graphic depictions of data for the
1989-2003 interval represent either an-
nual counts of decedents who died at
the specified sites or the proportions of
deaths occurring at home, with lines
and 95% confidence intervals fitted

portion of deaths at home for each of

cal significance.
RESULTS
Of the 896 509 deaths that occurred
during infancy, childhood, or adoles-
cence in the United States between 1989
and 2003, 22.1% (N=198 160) were at-
tributed primarily to an underlying
complex chronic condition. Of these
complex chronic condition-related
deaths, 55% occurred in males, 57%
were younger than 1 year of age, and
76% were white. Overall, 82% of chil-
dren died in the hospital and 15% died
in the home setting (TABLE 1). Ninety-
two percent of infants aged younger
than 1 year died in the hospital, whereas
70% of children and adolescents aged
1 to 19 years died in the hospital.
Among infants, the predominant cause
of death was cardiovascular condi-
tions (32%), followed by congenital or
genetic (26%), respiratory (17%), and
neuromuscular (14%) conditions. In
the older age categories, the leading
cause of death was malignancy (43%),
followed by neuromuscular (23%) and
cardiovascular (17%) conditions.

all age groups (overall, from 10.1% in
1989 to 18.2% in 2003), but with larger
increases for deaths beyond infancy
(FIGURE 2). The percentage of indi-

(4.9% home deaths in 1989 to 7.3% in

The percentage of deaths that oc-
curred at home and the pattern of
change in this percentage over time var-
ied substantially among the types of
complexchronicconditions(FIGURE 3).
Malignancy-associated deaths among
children and adolescents aged 1 to 19
years were the most likely to occur at
home, and with much of the observed
increase in home death occurring be-
tween 1989 (27.6%) and 1995 (40.3%),
with subsequently stable percentages
peaking in 2003 (41.1%). Infant deaths
associated with respiratory complex
chronic conditions were the least likely
to occur at home (range, 0.5%-1.3%).
Adjusting for various demographic
and clinical characteristics of the dece-
dents (TABLE 2), the odds of death oc-
curring at home increased by 3.8% (95%
confidenceinterval[CI],3.4%-4.0%)an-
nually. The decedents' race, ethnicity,
and region of home residence were sig-
nificantly associated with death occur-
ring at home. The odds of dying at home
were reduced among black and His-
panicindividuals(oddsratio[OR],0.50;

of the United States. Across all age cat-
egories, individuals with malignancy,

were consistently associated with the
greatest likelihood of death having oc-
curred at home.
The racial and ethnic disparities re-
garding the percentage of deaths among
decedents with complex chronic con-
ditions were evident across the entire
study interval (FIGURE 4). Overall
among infants, children, and adoles-
cents the percentage of white non-
Hispanic decedents who died at home
increased from 13.0% in 1989 to 22.5%

in 2003, whereas the percentage of
white Hispanic decedents increased
from 6.3% in 1989 to 14.6% in 2003,
and the percentage of black non-
Hispanic decedents increased from
6.3% in 1989 to 11.2% in 2003.
To illustrate in absolute terms the
geographic differences and racial and
ethnic disparities previously noted, we
examined the percentage of home
deaths occurring during the 5-year in-
terval between 1999 and 2003 in the 5
states with the most complex chronic
condition-associated deaths, focusing
on 3 paradigmatic cases: infants with
congenital/genetic conditions; 1- to
9-year-old children with malignancy;
and 10- to 19-year-old children and
adolescents with neuromuscular con-
ditions (FIGURE 5). Stratifying by the
race and ethnicity of the decedents, sig-
nificant variation in the percentages of
home deaths exists both within states
and between states (P.001 for tests re-
garding both state-level differences and
for interactions between specific states
and race/ethnicity). For instance,
among white non-Hispanic infants dy-
ing in Texas with a congenital/genetic
condition, 14.1% died at home, while
among comparable white Hispanic and
black non-Hispanic infants, only 8.9%
and 7.4% died at home, respectively. In
contrast to the typical pattern of home
deaths being less common among black
and Hispanic individuals, Florida chil-
dren and adolescents aged 10 to 19
years who died of neuromuscular con-
ditions did so at home more often if they
were black non-Hispanic (45.8%) than
if they were white Hispanic (40.0%) or
white non-Hispanic (36.8%) children
and adolescents (P=.04).
COMMENT
Between 1989 and 2003 across the
United States, the place of death shifted
from predominantly the hospital in-
creasingly toward the home setting
among children whose deaths were at-
tributed to a complex chronic condi-
tion. Among this group, which com-
prised one fifth of all pediatric deaths,
significant racial and ethnic dispari-
ties were observed in the likelihood
of death occurring at home, with these
differences persisting even after adjust-
ment for decedents' age, sex, complex
chronic condition type, geographic
location, and the overall temporal
trend.
Before considering the implications
of the shift in the place of death to-
ward home, the racial and ethnic dis-
parities, and implications regarding
both the structure and equity of pedi-
atric chronic and end-of-life care, the
strengths and weaknesses of this study
warrant consideration. Three charac-
teristics of the findings support the
strength of this study. First, the prin-
cipal results of this national study ac-
cord with a previous study that was lim-
ited to only Washington State from
1980 to 1998.31 Second, the overall pat-

tern of the findings, an increasing pro-
portion of deaths due to chronic ill-
ness occurring at home with notable
differences across racial and ethnic
groups, is similar to what has been
noted for adults.22,27 Third, the magni-
tude of the temporal trends and the ra-
cial and ethnic disparities regarding
where children die are not only statis-
tically significant but substantial and
pronounced.
Two limitations may have influ-
enced the detailed precision of the re-
sults of this study. First, a small pro-
portion of deaths may have been
misclassified as being associated (or not
associated) with a specific complex
chronic condition category because (1)
the data source relies on the original
death certificates, some of which may
have recorded diagnostic information
erroneously (a known problem among
adult decedents, especially the elder-
ly37,38); (2) the complex chronic con-
dition classification was based only on
the primary underlying cause of death
ICD-9 code, which probably resulted in
the exclusion of an estimated 4% of
deaths associated with complex chronic
conditions but which on the death cer-
tificate had the complex chronic con-
dition listed only as a secondary cause;
and (3) ICD-10 codes were converted
into ICD-9 codes (for the years 1999-
2003) with an estimated misclassifica-
tion error of 1%. Second, race or eth-
nicity may have been misclassified for
some decedents due to errors in the
originaldeathcertificates.Arecentcom-
munity-based study of adults, how-
ever, found 97% agreement between
race and ethnicity recorded on the death
certificate and the decedents' prior self-
reported race and ethnicity.39 Such er-
rors though are unlikely to account for
the main finding of the study regard-
ing the increasing percentage over time
of complex chronic condition-related
deaths occurring at home or to have in-
troduced significant bias into the age-,
race-, or ethnicity-specific associa-
tions that were observed in this study.
What might explain a greater pro-
portion of children with complex
chronic conditions increasingly dying
at home and the likelihood of home
death being associated with the child's
race or ethnicity? Currently, the mecha-
nisms underlying the observed shift in
the place of death are unknown and
warrant clarification. First, improve-
ments in the medical management of
pediatric complex chronic conditions
may be prolonging survival, both in-
creasing the prevalence of children liv-
ing with life-threatening complex
chronic conditions and providing more
time for advanced decision making.
Similarly, advances in medical technol-
ogy in the home setting, ranging from
gastrostomy feeding tubes to home ven-
tilators, may be enabling an increas-
ing percentage of medically fragile or
technologically dependent children to
spend longer periods of time living at
home; hence, the possibility of dying
at home (either foreseen or acciden-
tal) has risen. Finally, broad shifts in
attitudes and decision-making pro-

life care in US culture and increasing
capacity of the health care system to
provide home-based services at the end
of life may be affecting treatment for
children living with life-threatening
conditions. Changes in any of these
3 possible underlying mechanisms may
also explain the observed racial and eth-
nic differences, whereby differential ac-
cess to health care services or medical
technology, divergent cultural atti-
tudes or approaches to palliative and
end-of-life care decision making, or dif-
fering levels of financial or other sup-
