Abstract: We propose a cognitive-evolutionary model of grief where the function of grief is
to reunite a person with an absent partner where this is possible, and where it is not, to
disengage and reorientate the individual from the lost agent. The present study investigates
the potential factors that affect reunion-promoting symptoms by focusing on the
misattribution of external stimuli to the deceased by the bereaved - which we term `false
recognitions'. We propose three factors that relate to false recognitions: First, we propose
that strong attachment to the deceased predisposes one to false recognitions; second, we
predict that viewing photographs of the deceased (that were taken when the individual was
alive) perpetuates false recognitions; and third, we propose that time elapsing since the death
diminishes the frequency of false recognitions. In a survey of 164 recently bereaved (<25
months) pet owners in the U.S. and U.K., predictions concerning the association of the
predictor and outcome variables were confirmed. The strongest predictor was the frequency
of viewing photographic images of the deceased, a pattern consonant with our premise that,
being evolutionarily novel, realistic photographs are treated as reliable cues that the agent
remains a viable relationship partner. This research demonstrates the potential of
evolutionary theory to inform mainstream bereavement research.

Introduction
Grief is the universal response to the deprivation of a valued relationship partner. In
the context of death, grief typically consists of a series of cognitive-emotional symptoms
including yearning for reunion, intrusive thoughts of the deceased, nostalgia, and intense
sadness (Freed, Yanagihara, Hirsch, and Mann, 2009). To date, two divergent theories have
been advanced in an effort to explain the evolutionary function of grief. The reunion theory
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1085-
proposes that the proper domain of grief is the loss of a partner due to separation or
estrangement rather than death (Archer, 2001; Bowlby, 1982). In this view, the function of
grief is to motivate efforts at reunion; grief in the context of the death of a partner is thus
understood as an unavoidable by-product of a separation response that evolved to maintain
fitness-enhancing relationships. The reorientation theory posits that grief following the
death of a loved one is a unique functional process that evolved to cope with a terminal loss
by facilitating disengagement from the deceased and reorientation to a new status through a
process of reassessing plans, priorities, and relationships, while simultaneously signaling a
changed status to others (Freud, 1914/1951; Nesse, 2005).
While the reunion theory has been received relatively more favorably among clinical
researchers than the reorientation account, neither has been well integrated into the
mainstream bereavement literature. Aside from differences in research focus (i.e., proximate
vs. ultimate factors) and objectives (i.e., reducing subjective distress vs. understanding the
trait's evolution), bereavement scholars have argued that evolutionary theories have not been
incorporated into bereavement research primarily because they lack conceptual clarity, and a
corresponding absence of clearly defined testable predictions. Some scholars have challenged
proponents of evolutionary accounts of grief to empirically test their proposals in order to
further their integration with existing theories, but these calls have, to date, remained largely
unaddressed (see Bonanno, 2001).
The aim of this paper is to showcase the potential contribution of an evolutionary
approach to bereavement research by generating and testing novel predictions. Our goal is
not to adjudicate between the two existing evolutionary theories of grief. This is because we
believe that neither the reunion nor the reorientation account alone provides a sufficiently
comprehensive explanation of the function of grief to accommodate all of the principal facets
of the phenomenon. In our view, grief is a process that has two functions: First, in cases
where reunion is possible, grief enhances the likelihood that it will occur, thus leveraging
existing investments in a valuable relationship and avoiding the time, energy, and
opportunity costs of establishing a replacement relationship. Second, in cases where reunion
is not possible ­ death of the relationship partner being the most definitive variant thereof ­
grief facilitates the reconceptualization of the other as no longer a living, viable relationship
partner, opening the door to investment in new relationships. Thus, grief may well consist of
multiple mechanisms, each of which produces particular symptoms in particular contexts.
This view of grief is consonant with large-scale longitudinal research showing that different
symptoms are characteristically evinced at different times in the process of grief, e.g.,
yearning for reunion within the first 6 months, and acceptance between 7-12 months
(Maciejewski, Zhang, Block, and Prigerson, 2007).
A cognitive-evolutionary account of grief
We propose that the reunion and reorientation theories of grief can be consolidated
into a single cognitive account in which multiple evolved psychological mechanisms are
deployed when an individual is separated from a valued relationship partner. These include
both (1) mechanisms designed to promote reunion with a lost agent where this is possible
(predominantly taking the form of symptoms such as yearning for reunion; see Bowlby,
1982), and (2) when there is evidence that the valued other is deceased, mechanisms
designed to promote coming to terms with the permanent loss of the other by disengagement
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1086-
and reorientation to a new status without him or her (predominantly taking the form of
symptoms such as rumination and sadness; see Nesse, 2005).
If the above approach is correct, it should be possible to disaggregate grief into
evolutionary meaningful subtypes, based on the postulated functions of the symptoms
themselves. In the present paper, we focus on factors that influence the operation of
mechanisms designed to promote reunion with a lost agent. We propose that a mechanism
that functions to detect agents in the environment becomes hypervigilant following the loss
of a valued relationship partner, in order to detect whether reunification with a specific agent
is possible. This hypervigilance leads to an increase in `false positives': the extent to which
environmental stimuli (e.g., sights, sounds) are misattributed as being caused by the lost
agent. We term these phenomena false recognitions to distinguish these experiences, the
attribution of stimuli to a specific agent, from the attribution of stimuli to a generic agent. We
propose that false recognitions can be understood as an index that the bereavement process is
incomplete, hindering the employment of mechanisms to disengage and reorient to a new
status without the lost agent (see 2, above).
To sketch the logic of our enterprise in advance of the full exposition of our
theoretical framework, here we investigate three factors which, we propose, will impact the
experience of false recognitions. First, because the costs of failing to detect opportunities for
reunion should scale with the value of the lost relationship, we predict that strong attachment
to the deceased (a subjective proxy for relationship investment/value) will predispose the
bereaved to experience false recognitions. Second, being hypervigilant is costly, and such
costs mount over time. Paralleling this, ceteris paribus, the probability that reunification will
occur declines as a function of the passage of time. Together, these two considerations lead
us to predict that the passage of time will diminish the experience of false recognitions.
Third, photographs depicting the deceased while alive constitute evolutionarily novel stimuli.
Accordingly, we expect that such photographs are treated to some degree by evolved
mechanisms as veridical input, and are thus processed as cues that the deceased is present.
This leads to the prediction that viewing such photographs will increase the experience of
false recognitions. Below, we lay out our theoretical framework in more complete detail.
Agent hypervigilance
Because of their myriad implications for fitness, people are unconsciously biased
towards detecting cues of agency in the environment. The elicitation of agent-detection
systems has been interpreted in terms of error management theory, which predicts that
natural selection will bias the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli toward the less-costly
error: whether the situation is agonistic or cooperative, failing to detect an agent who is
present will generally be more costly than erroneously presuming that an agent is present
when one is not, hence agent-detection mechanisms should be biased toward false positives
(Barrett and Behne, 2005; Haselton and Buss, 2000; Haselton and Nettle, 2006; Johnson,
2000). In addition to the baseline sensitivity towards agency that operates for humans
generally, grief motivates the bereaved to seek out information indicating whether reunion
with a specific agent, a lost relationship partner, is possible (Archer and Winchester, 1994;
Freed et al., 2009; Johnson, 1992; Shear and Shair, 2005). Bereaved individuals are thus
expected to be exceptionally vigilant towards detecting cues of the presence of a lost agent,
in order to make two decisions: first, whether the target is present in the vicinity, and second,
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1087-
whether the target is alive and therefore still a viable relationship partner.
False recognitions
One postulated consequence of the hypervigilance to cues of agency is the over-
detection of signs of the deceased agent in the environment. Recent neurobiological research
supports this claim. For example, recently bereaved pet owners demonstrate attentional bias
towards deceased-related words in Emotional Stroop tasks (Freed et al., 2009). Furthermore,
anecdotal, descriptive and self-report data suggests that it is common for bereaved
individuals to interpret sights and sounds as having been caused by the deceased followed by
the disquieting realization then that the loved one is dead, especially in the first 12 months
following bereavement (Archer and Winchester, 1994; Maciejewski et al., 2007; Olson,
Suddeth, Peterson, and Egelhoff, 1985; Weisman, 1990). The experiences are not (at least in
elderly European populations) associated with depression or other psychological negative
symptoms, and are associated with long and happy relationships (Grimby, 1993). Despite
these facts, these experiences have been largely overlooked in conventional theories of grief
and have not been deemed worthy of investigation in their own right.
We define false recognitions as the automatic misperception of external stimuli as
being caused by a particular agent. To be clear, false recognitions are not hallucinations; they
do not occur in the absence of external, or relevant, stimuli and they are attributed as a
`misperception' by the perceiver ­ the bereaved individual knows at a conscious level, after
the initial experience, that the sight or sound has not been produced by the deceased agent
(see Aleman and Larøi, 2008, for a sophisticated discussion of misperception). As we have
outlined, in our view, false recognitions reveal the bereaved to be in a state of detecting
whether reunification with the lost agent is possible, and therefore to not have fully
reconceptualized the deceased as no longer a living, viable relationship partner. From a
cognitive perspective, false recognitions can thus be understood as an index that the grief
process is incomplete. It appears that cognitive mechanisms responsible for quick-and-dirty
interpretation of stimuli, the so-called low-road aspects of perception, continue to represent
the deceased as an agent capable of producing sights and sounds that impinge on the
observer. At the same time, cognitive mechanisms responsible for slower, more reflective
processing, the so-called high-road components of perception, no longer represent the agent
in this manner ­ hence the disquieting conflict between the initial interpretation of sights or
sounds as caused by the loved one, followed by the subsequent recollection that the loved
one is dead, and realization that the initial interpretation must be erroneous. Eventually,
however, representations of the deceased become so sufficiently reformulated that their
influence on relevant aspects of cognition becomes uniform ­ the loved one is represented as
no longer a viable relationship partner at all levels of representation, with the result that
sights and sounds are no longer perceived as stemming from the loved one, and the
experience of false recognition dissipates (Freed et al., 2009; Maciejewskiet al., 2007;
Prigerson et al., 1995). At this time, the bereaved will disengage and reorient him- or herself
to a new status without the lost agent.
As noted in our initial sketch, holding aside questions of their influence on other
aspects of the grief experience, we predict that three variables will impact upon the
experience of false positives in recently bereaved pet owners: attachment to the deceased,
time elapsed since death of significant other, and viewing images of the deceased depicting
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1088-
them while alive. Below, we explain the logic of each of these predictions in more detail.
Attachment level to the deceased
From an evolutionary perspective, not all relationships are equal, and therefore, not
all efforts to recover a relationship will be equal. For example, the losses of genetically
related relationships, and losses that occur to an individual when reproductive value is high
(i.e., adolescent children) have been found to be the most painful (e.g., for research, see
Segal, 1998; Lasker and Toedter, 2000; Wijngaards-de-Meij et al., 2007). Another factor that
should determine the level of grief response following bereavement is the amount of
investment that has gone into the relationship (e.g., time, resources). Clinical research reveals
that the level of attachment to the deceased ­ a subjective proxy for relationship investment ­
is a good predictor of overall grief intensity (Archer and Winchester, 1994; Freed et al.,
2009; Shear and Shair, 2005). These measures focus on the overall experience of grief,
whereas we are primarily interested in one cognitive component--false recognitions. We
predict that the degree of relationship investment will also be a good predictor of the
cognitive experience of grief.
From an evolutionary perspective, relationships are expensive. The start up costs for a
new relationship are large and there is no certainty that a new relationship will be found.
Therefore, hastily giving up on a relationship reduces fitness, and the more that has been
invested in a relationship, the greater this reduction. More specifically, the start up costs for
new relationships must be weighed against both the likelihood of reunification with the lost
agent and the amount of investment that has gone into the relationship. Where investment in
the relationship is especially high, replacement costs will likewise be high, and hence
individuals highly attached to the lost agent are expected to be even more vigilant regarding
cues of the agent's continued presence, and to engage in extended `searching
behaviors'(Archer and Winchester, 1994; Freed et al., 2009; Shear and Shair, 2005).
Irrespective of their behavior following bereavement, individuals who have a high degree of
investment in another are likely to be predisposed towards the experience of false positives.
Therefore, we predict that the level of attachment (a proxy for investment) will positively
correlate with the extent of misattributions of ambiguous stimuli to the lost agent, such that
the experience of false recognitions will increase as a function of attachment.
Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement
Given the costs of both searching and going without a relationship partner, for any
given level of prior investment in a relationship with a missing partner, there must be an
inflection point beyond which efficiency demands that the relationship be abandoned and a
replacement be sought. If a reunion-promoting adaptation exists, it must thus necessarily be
the case that the mechanism calculates the probability of reunion based on events to date ­
without such capabilities, the postulated mechanism would be grossly maladaptive, endlessly
motivating fruitless behavior. Indeed, bereavement research shows that individuals who
continue to display attentional bias to reminders of the deceased after 18 months ­ i.e.,
`complicated' grief (a condition affecting around 10% of the Western bereaved population) ­
incur significant physical and mental health problems and display impaired daily functioning
(Maccallum and Bryant, 2010). We therefore predict that time elapsed since the onset of
bereavement will constitute a diminishing factor, and thus will negatively correlate with the
Evolutionizing grief

extent of false recognitions.
Viewing photographic images of the deceased
There are many cues in the environment that suggest that a particular agent is in the
immediate vicinity--items of clothing, objects, agent smell, etc. Such cues vary in reliability.
Stimuli that involve faces and eyes are likely to be processed as the most reliable. Consonant
with the highly social nature of our species and the corresponding importance that social
interactions hold for fitness, the human mind contains agent and face detection mechanisms
(Johnson, 2000). Importantly, the effects of the input provided by these systems to other
psychological mechanisms are at least partly independent of propositional knowledge and are
likely to be highly reliable cues of agency. For example, in keeping with the importance in
human societies of maintaining a positive reputation and avoiding punishment, a variety of
experiments document that images of eyes can promote prosocial behavior and inhibit
antisocial behavior (Nettle et al., 2012; Nettle, Nott, and Bateson, 2012). The nature of the
stimuli used in such experiments makes it clear that individuals' behavior is altered despite
the fact that, at an explicit level of consciousness, they are aware that drawings or posters of
eyes are not real agents. Moreover, research suggests that stimuli that activate agent systems
and facial detection mechanisms are treated as highly reliable cues that a familiar other is
present. For example, neurobiological research reveals that viewing photographs of familiar
others activates facial recognition systems (i.e., personal identification networks) as though
the individuals viewed were physically present (Leveroni et al., 2000; Shah et al., 2001).
Input suggesting that the deceased is alive will enhance the conflict between the old
representation of the loved one and the new representation to which the bereaved is
transitioning. Correspondingly, if false recognitions are a symptom of the degree of
incompleteness of this process, then input suggesting that the deceased is alive will
exacerbate the experience of false recognitions. Because realistic photographs and other
media were not components of the stimulus environment in which the mechanisms
underlying grief evolved, they may be processed at least to some degree as veridical. It
therefore follows that exposure to such images will positively correlate with the experience
of false recognitions. Just as in the case of images of watching eyes, the functioning of
relevant mental mechanisms will be affected by these evolutionarily novel stimuli despite
propositional knowledge that they are inanimate, producing input that interferes with the
process of forming new cognitive representations of the deceased. Thus, frequently viewing
realistic photographs of the deceased is likely to be a perpetuating factor in the experience of
false recognitions, and hence this behavior will positively correlate with such experiences.
Interactions between attachment, image-viewing behavior, and time elapsed
Thus far, we have outlined the predicted individual relationships between attachment
level, elapsed time since the onset of bereavement, and viewing behavior on the extent of
false recognitions, a cognitive symptom of grief. However, if we are to fully test the core
predictions generated by our hypothesis, we must also consider the possible relationships of
these three factors to each other.
First, we expect attachment level and frequency of viewing behavior to be positively
correlated. As we have outlined, those highly attached are likely to be more motivated to
seek out cues of the deceased. Thus, they are more likely to engage in viewing images of the
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1090-
deceased, when alive. We do not, however, expect attachment to perfectly correlate with the
frequency of viewing images. Bereavement research has shown that while the majority of
those highly attached to their deceased loved ones are more likely to engage in `searching
behaviors' (which we presume, here, would include revisiting photographs of them when
alive), a significant minority avoid all reminders of the deceased ­ including viewing
photographic images of them (see Archer and Winchester, 1994; Freed et al., 2009).
Second, as we have outlined, elapsed time is a proxy for the probability of reunion,
and thus engaging in reunion-seeking behaviors becomes increasingly maladaptive as time
passes. Correspondingly, we expect a negative correlation between time and the frequency
of revisiting reminders of the deceased, including images. Likewise, to the extent that
transitioning from hypervigilance to disengagement occurs over time, the passage of time
should be negatively correlated with attachment level.
Predictions
To summarize the above discussion, our core predictions concerning the relationships
between the predictor variables (frequency of viewing images, attachment, time elapsed) and
the key outcome variable (false recognitions) are as follows:
1. Level of attachment will positively correlate with the extent of false recognitions.
2. The frequency of viewing images will positively correlate with the extent of false
recognitions.
3. Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement will negatively correlate with the extent
of false recognitions.
Our secondary predictions concerning the relationships between the predictor variables
(frequency of viewing images, attachment, time lapsed) are as follows:
4. Attachment level and frequency of viewing behavior will be positively correlated.
5. Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement will negatively correlate with the
frequency of viewing images.
6. Time elapsed since the onset of bereavement will negatively correlate with
attachment level.
It is important to note that, while our theory proposes a causal relationship between
the key predictor and outcome variables, our predictions concern only the associations
between these variables, due to the naturalistic methodology we employ. While an
association in the predicted direction is necessarily part of the causal story we propose, of
course, correlation does not equal causation. In this paper, we make a preliminary
contribution to the testing of the causal claims by focusing on the correlations; namely, the
effect of viewing photographs of the deceased, when alive, on the extent of false recognitions
up to 24 months after the death of a loved one using a survey of bereaved pet owners. We
address this limitation in more detail in the discussion section.
Pet loss
Cultural beliefs and practices shape exposure to dying individuals, the preparation of
the remains of the deceased, interactions with the remains, representation of the deceased in
the afterlife, and exposure to photographs and films of the deceased. Likewise, beliefs and
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1091-
practices also influence both the expression of grief and the appropriateness of death, dying,
and grief as topics of discussion (see Rosenblatt, 1993). Compounding these complexities,
these factors likely covary with hospice and funerary practices (see Walter, 2005). As a
consequence of these considerations, it may well prove difficult to tease out the independent
effects of exposure to different types of stimuli on the frequency of false recognitions
predicted by the above framework. Accordingly, the present enterprise is best served by
sidestepping these matters to the extent possible.
Bereavement following the death of a beloved pet offers a pragmatic solution to the
above methodological problem. Approximately 62% of U.S. households own a pet
(McConnell, Brown, Shoda, Stayton, and Martin, 2011), around 70% of owners carry a
photograph of their pet on their person (Archer, 1997), and many report mistaking sights and
sounds for their deceased pet during bereavement (Weisman, 1990). Archer (1997) argues
that pets can be understood as exploiting human responses that evolved to facilitate human
relationships, primarily (but not exclusively) those between parent and child. While
accepting this general framework, we would temper it somewhat by noting the long history
of mutualism between humans and domesticated animals (dogs being perhaps the paramount
case), suggesting a degree of mutualistic co-evolution rather than simply unidirectional
parasitism (see Serpell, 1996). Although there are substantial differences between human-
human and human-companion-animal relationships, what is important for the present study is
the extent to which both the investment process and the grief response are similar in both
relationship types. A wealth of research supports the claim that these two processes are
remarkably similar, and, accordingly, much clinical research on bereavement uses pet loss as
a proxy for human grief. Specifically, people form strong attachments to their pets, such that
the death of a pet can elicit a grief response similar to that experienced following the loss of a
family member (Clements, Benasutti, and Carmone, 2003).
Despite this, at least at the national level, Western culture does not contain any
normative practices concerning the death of a pet, nor are there any mores concerning
discussion of this topic; indeed, the absence of both institutionalized practices and explicit
recognition of the impact of pet death on pet owners constitutes a positive affordance from
the perspective of research, as, lacking other avenues with which to manage their distress,
many bereaved owners express a desire to share their experiences with others, as evidenced
by pet loss forums and virtual pet cemeteries on the Internet.
Methods
Participants
Volunteers for an unpaid online survey on experiences associated with the death of a
pet were recruited through pet loss websites and forums (87%), and via flyers displayed in
waiting areas in veterinary practices in Belfast and Los Angeles (13%). Two hundred and
forty-seven individuals participated; 83 participants were excluded because they failed to
complete the online survey or did not meet the minimum criteria (were below the age of 18,
resided in a country other than the U.S. or U.K., had owned their pet for less than 6 years,
had owned a pet other than a cat or dog, did not regard their pet as a `companion animal', had
lost their pet more than 24 months prior to participation or did not have any photographs of
their pet). This left a sample of 164 bereaved pet owners (133 female, 31 male; age range
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1092-
18­67, mean age 35); most participants lived in the United States (72%; United Kingdom,
28%). See Table 1 for participant descriptive information.
Materials
The survey was created using the platform SurveyMonkey. Survey items addressed
demographic information about the participants and their pet, and the circumstances
surrounding their pet's death. All participants included in the study possessed photographs
of their pet that were taken when the pet was alive. Participants were asked whether, and how
often, they viewed these images after their pet's death (on a 5 point scale: daily, weekly,
monthly, on special occasions, never). Participants also completed the 23-item Lexington
Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS; Johnson, Garrity, and Stallones, 1992), responding to items
on a 4-point scale (ranging from definitely applies to me to definitely does not apply to me)
that measures emotional attachment to a pet, with a higher score denoting a higher level of
subjective attachment; this scale has high internal validity and is the most popular
questionnaire amongst clinical researchers for the assessment of pet attachment.
There is no standardized questionnaire that measures false recognitions exclusively.
Researchers have included individual items in previous questionnaires that address aspects of
our dependent variable, i.e., false recognitions ­ such as yearning for reunion and searching
behaviors. Therefore, we used a combination of pre-existing items and novel items designed
to measure false recognitions (see Appendix 1). Specifically, we assessed false recognitions
using six statements addressing the extent to which, in the past two weeks, participants had
interpreted ambiguous stimuli (e.g., sights, sounds) as the deceased pet. Items addressed
experiences such as often believing that one saw or heard the pet, and often mistaking
another pet for one's own. Three items were taken directly from the 29-item Pet Loss
Questionnaire (PLQ) developed by Archer and Winchester (1994). To increase breadth, we
added three novel items. Following the PLQ, participants responded using a 3-point scale,
ranging from applies to me to does not apply to me (see Appendix 1). A higher score on the
scale denotes the frequent experience of misperceiving stimuli as being caused by the
deceased pet in multiple modalities (e.g., sight, sound). Although we did not measure the
frequency of such experiences directly, agreement that experiences often happened was taken
as a proxy for a high degree of multiple instances of false recognitions (e.g., sights, sounds,
etc). Our six-item scale, which we term the False Recognition Questionnaire, has excellent
internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient .92).
Results
Demographics
All participants had lost a pet through death within 24 months of completing the
survey (study criteria). Most participants (100, or 61%) had lost their pet between 3 and 12
months prior to participation, and 64 participants (39%) had lost their pet between 13 and 24
months in the past. One hundred and seven participants (65%) had lost a dog and 57
participants (35%) had lost a cat.
Viewing images of pet
All participants possessed photographs of their pet taken before its death (study
Evolutionizing grief

criteria). Sufficient variance in the key independent variable existed for us to test our core
prediction: while slightly more than half of the participants (95, 58%) viewed these images
frequently ­ ranging from daily to weekly basis, many participants (70, 42%) viewed them
infrequently or not at all ­ ranging from monthly, to special occasions, to yearly.
Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale
The maximum possible score on the LAPS is 69. Among U.S. pet owners in general,
the average score is 45. The scale is more adept at measuring strong pet attachment because
the majority of the items are indicators of intense attachment (Johnson et al., 1992); hence a
score of 45 indicates a strong attachment to the pet. Participants' scores on the LAPS
questionnaire varied greatly (19-69), with a normal distribution of scores, but most
participants were very strongly attached to their pet (M = 52, SD = 11). This is likely to have
been a result of targeting participants via pet loss forums and websites, as individuals who
frequent such sites are likely to have had strong emotional ties to their pets. Given that we
employ bereavement in the context of pet death as a model system for bereavement in the
context of human death, this bias is an asset, as it makes the sample more comparative to
human loss in terms of attachment levels.
False Recognition Questionnaire
The maximum possible score on the False Recognition Questionnaire, assessing the
extent of false recognitions, is 18. Scores on the False Recognition Questionnaire ranged
between 6 and 18 (M = 10, SD = 4, with a normal distribution of scores). This suggests that
many participants experienced false recognitions up to 24 months following their pet's death.

Statistical analyses
We first conducted tests for associations and relationships between the outcome and
predictor variables using Pearson's r. Correlation coefficients were computed for continuous
and categorical variables (categorical variables were dichotomized as displayed in Table 1).
Important predictor variables were level of attachment, frequency of viewing images, and
time.
Relationships between predictor and outcome variable
As Table 2 shows, several variables correlated significantly with scores on the False
Recognition Questionnaire, and all relationships were moderate. As per Prediction 1, there
was a positive correlation between attachment level, r (162) = .357, p < .01 and false
recognition scores, r (162) = .331, p < .01. There was also a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of viewing images and false recognition scores, r (162) = .331, p <
.01, confirming Prediction 2. Time elapsed since pet's death was significantly negatively
correlated with false recognition scores, r (162) = -.199, p < .05, confirming Prediction 3.
Relationships between predictor variables
In line with our secondary predictions, there were significant correlations between the
three main predictor variables. As per Prediction 4, there was a moderate positive correlation
between attachment scores and frequency of viewing images, r (162) = .393, p < .01. There
was also a negative correlation between time elapsed and frequency of viewing images, r
(162) = -.260, p < .01, and a negative correlation between time elapsed and attachment
scores, r (162) = -.213, p < .01, supporting Predictions 5 and 6.
Multiple regression analyses
We examined the extent to which variance in scores on the False Recognition
Questionnaire was predicted by a) frequency of viewing images, b) elapsed time since pet's
death, and c) the level of attachment to pet. Multiple regression was used to analyze the
contribution of each of the three variables to false recognition scores and to weigh the
accuracy with which the frequency of viewing images predicts false recognition scores
relative to the contributions of attachment and elapsed time.
Preliminary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of the assumptions of
normality, linearity, multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity. Using the enter method, a
significant model emerged [F(3), 160 = 11.977], p < .05. Adjusted R2 = .168. The total
variance explained by the model was 16.8%. The frequency of viewing images made the
strongest unique contribution ( = .539), which was statistically significant (p <. 01);
frequency of viewing images of the pet predicted higher false recognitions scores. The LAPS
score also made a unique, albeit smaller, contribution ( = .082), which was statistically
significant (p < .01); specifically, higher attachment scores predicted higher false
recognitions scores. Time elapsed since pet's death was not a significant independent
predictor of false recognitions scores ( = -.040, p = .201). Although the correlations among
predictor variables were moderate, given the importance of the relationship between these to
our account, we conducted collinearity diagnostics. Results suggested that there was no
problem with collinearity in the data (all VIF levels were low, < 2.0).

Discussion
We have offered an evolutionary cognitive account of grief that reconciles previous
accounts and disaggregates the main symptoms into evolutionarily meaningful subtypes,
allowing us to begin investigating their postulated functions. We argue that distinct
mechanisms have evolved that, on the one hand, promote reunion with the lost agent, and, on
the other, when reunion is not possible, promote disengagement with the lost agent and
reorientation to a new status without the agent. With this as an overarching theoretical
framework, we investigated the functioning of one discrete cognitive mechanism--agent
detection--that becomes heightened when an agent is lost, and serves, in this context, to
determine whether a specific agent is in the vicinity and, therefore, still a viable relationship
partner. We hypothesized that this agent detection hyperactivity leads to a commonly
reported experience in those recently bereaved, namely that of misinterpreting ambiguous
stimuli (sights, sounds) as having been caused by the deceased agent, a phenomenon that we
term false recognition. We proposed that the frequency of false recognitions is an indication
of the extent to which the mechanisms designed to promote disengagement with the lost
agent and reorientation to a life without them have yet to be fully activated. In short, the
continued presence of false recognitions is an index that a principal transition in the
bereavement process, from the operation of reunification mechanisms to the operation of
reorientation mechanisms, has yet to be achieved.
We sought to investigate the factors that affect the functioning of the agent-detection
mechanism, enhancing or diminishing the experience of false recognitions, and thus
potentially retarding the grief process. Using bereavement following the death of a pet as a
model system, we examined three variables: attachment (a subjective proxy for relationship
commitment/value), the frequency of viewing photographic images depicting the deceased
while alive, and the time elapsed since the death of the deceased.
Attachment to the pet, frequency of viewing images of the pet, and the recency of the
pet's death all positively predicted the frequency of the experience of false recognitions.
Despite the complexity of the relationships between the variables examined, the strongest
predictor of false recognition was the frequency of viewing photographs of the deceased.
Viewing behavior made the largest unique contribution, such that level of attachment and
time elapsed since death could be removed and this factor would still accurately, and
Evolutionizing grief

independently, predict scores on the false recognition questionnaire. This pattern is
consonant with our premise that photographic images, being evolutionarily novel, are in part
processed as veridical, serving as a cue that the bereaved is in the vicinity, and thus
perpetuating the experience of false positive responses to more ambiguous stimuli. Further
research is needed to examine the discrete effects of realistic images as compared to the
influence on false recognitions of exposure to other reminders of the deceased or estranged
agents (e.g., clothing, smells).
Limitations and future directions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate false recognitions as a
cognitive component of the grief process and the determinants thereof. Likewise, to our
knowledge, this is the first study to explore the effects on the bereaved of viewing
photographic images of the deceased. For a number of reasons, our findings should be
considered preliminary. Some of the limitations of this study are characteristic of
bereavement research in general, and these are difficult to overcome in naturalistic studies
(Stroebe, Stroebe, and Hansson, 1993). In addition to the use of pet loss as a model system,
such limitations include using questionnaire methods that necessarily constrain our ability to
understand the direction of causality. We have provided evidence for associations that may
not be caused by our predictor variables in the hypothesized direction. For example, absent
detailed chronologies, we cannot rule out the possibility that false recognitions cause the
bereaved to seek out reminders of the deceased, leading to increased viewing of photographs.
Future experimental research could begin to tease these apart by, for example, manipulating
the amount of exposure to photographs and other cues of estranged agents while controlling
or accounting for other variables.
Further, our sample is not representative of the general population of bereaved pet
owners. It was limited to bereaved individuals in complex, English-speaking societies who
have access to the Internet, many of whom were actively searching for opportunities to
communicate with others about their loss, and who, correspondingly, were more attached to
their pets than the general bereaved population. Such individuals may well have been drawn
to seek out reminders of their deceased pets. Thus, perhaps we have missed an important
section of the community who are highly attached and yet avoidant of reminders.
Following the precedent of prior instruments from which it was derived, our False
Recognition Questionnaire employed self-reported agreement (i.e., strongly applies to me) in
a range of situations depicting false recognitions (e.g., sometimes, I hear my pet). We did
not, therefore, measure the exact frequency of false recognitions. Additionally, we did not
measure situational variables that could have been accounted for, such as the extent to which
the bereaved individual kept photos of the pet on display prior to the pet's death (making
subsequent viewing of photographs a matter of habit rather than an outgrowth of grief), as
well as features of the environment (e.g., the presence of other animals, etc.) likely to shape
exposure to ambiguous stimuli.
The experience of false recognitions has largely been overlooked in the conventional
grief literature. This may reflect a Western cultural bias where these types of experiences are
stigmatized as abnormal despite evidence that they occur frequently during bereavement.
Such stigma is likely culturally parochial (see, for example Yamamoto, Okonogi, Iwasaki,
and Yoshimura, 1969, on bereavement in Japan), and thus cross-cultural research may allow
Evolutionizing grief
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -1097-
for more direct study of false recognition in the context of human, rather than pet, death.
Our theory of grief incorporates the tenets of the reunion theory. Correspondingly,
we expect false recognition to occur during grief following the loss of a relationship for
reasons other than death. For example, non-acrimonious dissolution of a romantic
relationship or the extended separation of the parties (e.g., military families, etc.) should be
accompanied by a yearning for reunion, with a corresponding increase in false recognitions.
We expect this pattern to be exacerbated by frequently viewing images of the departed agent,
and to cease when the individual returns.
Implications of our research
Although our findings should be considered preliminary, nonetheless, they provide
reason for caution with regard to the clinical recommendation for the recently bereaved to
revisit mementos (especially photographs) of the deceased when they experience yearning
for reunion. Bereavement clinicians have actively prescribed such actions under a new
paradigm that encourages `continuing bonds' with the deceased (Klass, Silverman, and
Nickman, 1996), despite what is, at best, only equivocal evidence that this has a positive
effect on overall grief outcomes (Stroebe, Abakoumkin, Storebe, and Schut, 2011; Stroebe
and Schut, 2005). Frequently revisiting mementos and viewing photographs of the deceased
may indeed provide immediate reward, as neurobiological research suggests that this may
activate dopamine release and therefore temporarily enhance feelings of well-being (Freed
and Mann, 2007). However, our research suggests that such actions may delay the transition
from a grief phase characterized by a yearning for reunion to a phase characterized by
disengaging from representations of the deceased as a viable relationship partner, and
reorientation to a new status that does not involve the lost agent but includes new
relationships with the living. More than a century ago, Freud (1914/1951) fiercely argued for
the removal of reminders of the deceased in order for the bereaved to successfully detach.
Despite the profound problems with many aspects of his model of the mind, it appears that,
in this instance, Freud may have been right after all.
