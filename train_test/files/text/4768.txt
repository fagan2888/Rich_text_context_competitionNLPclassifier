Introduction
The Creative Institute for Toronto's Young (CITY) Leaders is a
leadership development institute for diverse young people
working and volunteering in the community and social service
sectoracrossToronto.Launchedin2008byUnitedWayToronto
(UWT), CITY Leaders was designed and delivered in partner-
ship with the Youth Challenge Fund (YCF) and the University
ofToronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of SocialWork (FIFSW).
Each year UWT has selected youth from neighborhoods
across Toronto to participate in CITY Leaders, which offers
a series of participatory educational workshops, applied
learning projects, mentorships, and other leadership develop-
ment opportunities over the course of 8 months. At the time
of this evaluation, the program had graduated 104 young
leaders from five different program cohorts. By the end of
the current funding that was available, seven cohorts or a
total of 149 participants had participated in the program.
Resources for Results, an independent evaluation firm,
was contracted by UWT in November 2012 to design and
implement an evaluation of the CITY Leaders program and
to create an evidence base on which to assess the results of
the first 5 years of leadership programming. The purpose of
the evaluation was to
·
· Examine a range of outcomes for CITY Leaders
participants
·
· Understand the contribution of various components to
program outcomes
·
· Explore how participants' characteristics and context
affect outcomes
·
· Reflect on the effectiveness of the multi-stakeholder
partnership
·
· Increase understanding of what role and value gradu-
ates place on an ongoing formal CITY Leaders net-
working function.
Although leadership development programs are abundant
in both the United States and Canada, there is a noticeable
absence of evaluations that have assessed the mid- and long-
term outcomes and impact of these programs (Russon &
Reinelt, 2004), including the lack of appropriate measure-
ment instruments (Black & Earnest, 2009). It is anticipated
that this evaluation will contribute important new evidence
regarding outcomes and learning about effective practices in
leadership development. The evaluation was also well timed
to coincide with two strategic reviews at UWT examining
the organization's priorities for youth programming and
capacity building into the future.

CITY Leaders: Building Youth
Leadership in Toronto
Wes Shera1 and Janet M. Murray2
Abstract
In 2008, United Way Toronto (UWT) launched the Creative Institute for Toronto's Young (CITY) Leaders, a leadership
development program for diverse young people working and volunteering in the community and social service sector across
Toronto, Canada. The investment in leadership capacity building provided a unique opportunity to explore the short- to
medium-term outcomes of the 104 youth who participated in five different program cohorts over 4 years. The UWT set
out to evaluate the CITY Leaders Program by focusing primarily on its outcomes and effectiveness. This article provides a
retrospective assessment of the impact of CITY Leaders, primarily through program graduates' reflections on their learning
and leadership development experience. It also documents outcomes at the personal, professional, and community levels.

CITY Leaders History
For well over a decade, UWT has made a sustained invest-
ment in leadership development. Guided by strong evidence
that organizational effectiveness depends on the availability
of highly capable leaders, UWT launched two leadership
programs: The Emerging Leaders Program focused on
social-sector managers and the Leaders of Today Program
focused on Executive Directors. At the time, however, few
leadership development programs in Toronto focused on
youth, and none was designed to open doors for low-income
and racialized youth (Erbstein, 2013). Through its youth
development programming, UWT identified the need for
youth leadership development to engage diverse youth from
across Toronto in the social sector and to provide a "pipe-
line" of young leaders to support succession planning as
baby boomer managers retired.
There was a growing awareness that the social sector
must work differently with youth, and extensive efforts were
made to engage and consult young people from Toronto's 13
priority, "marginalized" neighborhoods about their learning
needs and program design preferences. A Learning Partners
Consortium was organized in 2008 to engage thought leaders
in the field of leadership development in the design and
development of CITY Leaders. As part of this initial design
process, an extensive review of the literature on the design of
youth leadership development programs was completed
(Klau, 2006; Ritch & Mengel, 2009; Russon & Reinelt,
2004). CITY Leaders was launched in early 2008, and the
first two social service-sector cohorts went ahead in quick
succession with UWT as sole funder. The core offerings of
CITY Leaders included an intensive program of educational
sessions, mentorship, group-based applied learning projects,
and an online networking platform. This design has evolved
over time through formative evaluation, curriculum review,
and participant feedback.
After the first cohort went through the program in 2008,
CITY Leaders partnered with the FIFSW at the University of
Toronto to improve program design, co-deliver, and co-
certify the CITY Leaders program. In 2009, the YCF came
on board as a funder, promoting a new neighborhood cohort
to enhance the important work that UWT was already doing
to promote leadership capabilities and opportunities for
racialized and African diasporic youth from Toronto's most
marginalized neighborhoods. Additional collaborators and
contributors, to both the design and delivery of the program,
included the International Center for Studies in Creativity;
The Shambhala Institute for Authentic Leadership; The
Centre for Social Innovation (CSI); the Schulich School of
Business, York University; Laidlaw Foundation; Toronto
City Summit Alliance; The Ontario Council of Agencies
Serving Immigrants; Maytree Foundation; the Anti-Racism
and Cultural Diversity Office, University of Toronto; and the
Metcalf Foundation. In 2009, an Advisory Council was also
created to ensure ongoing quality and growth of the program.
The Council is composed of members from the Faculty of
Social Work, graduates of CITY Leaders, private-sector
advisors, and UWT staff.
Relevant Literature
Building on the extensive literature review that was previ-
ously done during the initial design of the program, a further
review was completed to identify core resources on leader-
ship program design and to identify lessons learned from
previous efforts to evaluate leadership development pro-
grams (Dugan, Turman, & Torrez, 2015; Russon & Reinelt,
2004). This review set the stage for the evaluation, laying out
some basic definitions, identifying design elements, noting
effective practices, and exploring theories of change that
could support the design of the CITY Leaders outcomes
evaluation.
The literature revealed consensus that conceptions of
leadership in the social sector have shifted away from tradi-
tional, top-down ideas of individual leadership, which are
now seen as being ineffective in our increasingly diverse and
complex social sector (Bolden, 2011; Hubbard, 2006).
Leadership is now conceived of as a more flexible, collab-
orative, democratic process that can come from a range of
levels and locations in a community or organization.
Collective leadership is based on the premise that leadership is
the product of groups rather than individuals . . . where collective
leadership works best is in complex and messy situations that
don't lend themselves to easy answers--precisely the kind of
situations the nonprofit sector confronts every day. (Hubbard,
2006, p. 13)
Emotional and social intelligence (Goleman, 2000) and
critical self-reflection (Torrez & Rocco, 2015) are also
increasingly seen as critical to effective leadership--
employers seek employees who have strong social skills,
self-discipline in work habits, cooperative abilities, and a
motivation for continuous learning on the job (Rosch &
Villanueva, 2016). Much of the current leadership literature
concludes that the process of leadership development is more
important than the actual content (Kress, 2006; Valorose,
2015). Although leadership development necessarily aims to
cultivate new kinds of thinking and acting in individuals,
leadership cannot be taught in a traditional way (Ritch &
Mengel, 2009). Leadership education must create an envi-
ronment that facilitates collaboration, analysis of issues, self-
awareness, professional skills and capacities, and exploration
of new leadership approaches and behaviors (Doherty, 2003).
In terms of youth development, Max Klau (2006)
addresses two critical questions: "What conceptions of lead-
ership inform the work of youth leadership educators in the
field today? What pedagogical techniques are employed by
programs to teach the model of leadership they espouse?"
(p. 58). These questions are based on insights and research
Shera and Murray 3
by authors such as Roach et al. (1999), who claim that many
youth leadership programs are derived from adult theories of
leadership and do not take into account the everyday or natu-
ral processes and situations that enable youth, particularly
those in at-risk environments, to emerge as leaders. New
forms of leadership development emphasize participation,
distribution of knowledge, systems thinking, teamwork, and
communities of learning and practice (Browne & Campione,
1990; Erbstein, 2013; Shah, 2011). Kress (2006) argues that
youth leadership development should emphasize experien-
tial learning and focus on the whole person within his or her
context and not simply on one issue or problem or one set of
skills.
Grantmakers for Effective Organizations (GEO) in the
United States conducted research into community leadership
development that remains highly influential and relevant
today (Enright, 2006). This study affirmed the direct connec-
tion between strong organizational leadership and program
results and suggests that leadership development interven-
tions can be intentionally designed to promote long-term
community impacts. They argue that leadership program
interventions are most effective when they are (a) collective,
(b) contextual, and (c) continuous.
Collective
Participatory leadership development strategies that build
strong relationships among individuals, organizations, and
networks are very effective in producing long-term out-
comes. Relationship building is core to leadership develop-
ment, supporting peer-based observational learning, where
participants learn from each other by modeling and imitating
new behaviors that they have observed (Bandura, 1986).
Effective program practices in this area include activities
such as peer-to-peer learning, network development, collab-
orative problem solving, building sector awareness, and col-
lective advocacy work. Broad-based community involvement
is also important in producing community results in social-
sector leadership development programs (Dugan et al., 2015;
Hubbard, 2006). Active engagement of the target community
in needs assessment, identification of core values, planning,
implementation, and evaluation ensure that the impacts of
the program affect both the youth and the communities in
which they live.
Contextual
Leadership development should be relevant and grounded in
the context within which its participants are working. It must
respond to the day-to-day problems that leaders face. For this
reason, it is important to design leadership development pro-
cesses that are respectful and consultative, authentically
addressing youth issues and experience (Enright, 2006).
Youth led processes contribute to the relevance and
effectiveness of leadership programs. GEO suggests that
learning should be customized and personally relevant to
participants. Effective practices in this area include building
collective knowledge and a process for examining pertinent
issues facing participants' communities, increasing self-
awareness, engaging participants in meaningful services to
the community, and organizing forums and learning groups
focused on practical problem solving based on actual cases
from participants' working lives (Doherty, 2003; Dugan
et al., 2015; Enright, 2006).
Continuous
Often leadership programs are not designed to support people
to apply new learning and sustain it through their ongoing
work with organizations and communities. New perspectives
and behaviors are less likely to take hold when a person must
apply them alone, without peer support or consultation.
Customized, one-to-one coaching is increasingly being used
in leadership programs to deepen the self-reflection compo-
nent of leadership programs and promote behavioral change.
Effective practices in this area include individualized coach-
ing as a follow-up strategy to provide support for ongoing
development and monitoring of personal and professional
change and the use of peer groups to provide support and
solve complex problems and issues (Enright, 2006; Ritch &
Mengel, 2009).
In terms of insights from the limited number of systematic
evaluations that have been conducted on leadership develop-
ment programs, a number of themes have emerged including
the difficulty encountered in contacting the alumni of a pro-
gram, the importance of collecting both quantitative and
qualitative data, the use of multiple methods to triangulate
data, the need to focus on capturing process and individual
differences, and the need to capture both perceptual and fac-
tual evidence related to outcomes and impact (Black &
Earnest, 2009; Martineau & Hannum, 2004; Patton, 1990;
Valorose, 2015). Of particular relevance to the current study
is Pratt, McGuigan, and Katzev's (2000) assertion that retro-
spective designs produce a more legitimate assessment of
leadership program outcomes than traditional pretest­post-
test methodology since many programs evolve over time, a
process often described as adaptive implementation (Metz &
Bartley, 2012). Pratt et al. (2000) also suggest procedures
that can be used to enhance the memories of those complet-
ing retrospective questionnaires such as the detailed cohort
specific descriptions of the program that were given to
respondents in the evaluation of the CITY Leaders program.
Program Overview
CITY Leaders has evolved over the years in its targeting,
objectives, program design, and content. Much of this evolu-
tion is the result of a consultative, continuous improvement
4 SAGE Open
approach that has been implemented through evaluation
activities and active engagement of staff and partners in pro-
gram refinement. In 2009, UWT evaluation staff worked to
further consolidate the model, developing a logic model and
learning objectives for CITY Leaders, increasing the connec-
tions between program themes and content to strengthen pro-
gram outcomes.
CITY Leaders was designed to focus at the individual
level, developing the capacity of young leaders to contribute
effectively to the priorities of their organizations and com-
munities. The objectives during the first 3 years of CITY
Leaders focused on individual-level outcomes, with more
emphasis on personal and professional development. By
Cohort 5 in 2011, the objectives had been revised and refo-
cused; they expressed more explicit expectations of improved
individual capacity to effect change at the organizational,
sectoral, and policy levels.
The Cohorts
CITY Leaders in the sectoral cohorts were diverse young
people between the ages of 18 and 32 (and later 25-29) who
were already working for social service and other commu-
nity-based organizations delivering programs and services in
Toronto's inner-city and inner-suburban neighborhoods.
Many of these young professionals already had a solid base
of capacity in organizational management and program
delivery. Many had completed a post-secondary college
diploma or university degree. The cohorts in the program
from 2008 to 2010 were sectoral. There have been no further
sectoral cohorts since then.
CITY Leaders in the neighborhood cohorts were selected
from racialized young community volunteers and activists
(age = 18-24) who lived in UWT's 13 priority neighbor-
hoods. These young leaders were already actively engaged
in organizing youth and supporting youth programming in
their own communities and may already have been working
for a community-based agency. This group was on average
younger than sectoral cohort participants and had less for-
mal education.
Overview of Program Components
The basic program consisted of a set of educational modules
(half, full, and two-day sessions) and other activities such as
mentoring and community-based social action projects. The
major components of the CITY Leaders program included
the following:
Opening retreat. This component has been facilitated over a
weekend in a residential learning environment. The empha-
sis is on personal reflection, team building, introducing the
idea of leadership, and creating a strong foundation and cul-
ture for peer learning.
A program of educational sessions. Offering core and elective
modules in collaboration with guest instructors from a vari-
ety of high-profile community, academic, and social ser-
vice organizations. The format for these modules varied
from half-day educational sessions to 2-day intensive
workshops.
Certification. By the second cohort (2009), UWT formed a
partnership with the University of Toronto's FIFSW and
began granting certificates for successful program comple-
tion. As a result, regular attendance, completion of assign-
ments, and make-up work requirements became more
important.
Coordinators anchor the program.The UWT program staff
played a proactive role in planning and organizing each ses-
sion, identifying instructors and working together with them
to ensure that the proposed session fitted with the identified
learning objectives, that the facilitation and materials were
well adapted to the learning styles and needs of participants,
and that each session was coordinated with the sessions
already facilitated. Staff also provided an "anchor" relation-
ship for participants, assisting them to participate and benefit
from the program.
Mentoring. The program mobilized senior professionals from
a range of sectors and professions to be matched with partici-
pants to provide customized, ongoing counseling, career
advice, and access to new networks.
Applied, group learning projects.Participants collaborated to
identify and complete a practical project using their new
knowledge and theory and connecting back to the commu-
nity and/or the social sector. Financial support of CAD
$1,000 was made available to each project team to support
the implementation of their project.
Online platform. A proprietary Internet-based social network-
ing platform was developed by UWT as an exclusive space
for participants to pursue discussion, share resources, facili-
tate networking opportunities, and provide an ongoing forum
for formative evaluation of the program.
Closing retreat.
Added in 2010, this component was
designed to provide closure to the CITY Leaders' program,
affirming the learning of participants and promoting the
long-term relationship and networking of each cohort into
the future.
Graduation. A ceremony organized and attended by funders,
peers, and colleagues. It is at this session that participants
made a presentation of their community-based social
action/advocacy projects and received feedback on their
work.

Some of the key changes in the program over the years
have included improvements to outreach, recruitment, and
selection; revision of program structure and content, resulting
in the creation of core and elective modules; selection of more
diverse instructors; engagement of alumni in the program; and
revision of the mentorship component of the program design.
Evaluation Methodology
An Advisory Group with representatives from the two core
program partners worked closely with the evaluator to guide
evaluation design and implementation. The partners were
interested in documenting the outcomes of CITY Leaders and
reviewing the effectiveness of different components of the
program in bringing about leadership outcomes. They were
also keen to assess the merit of providing further support to
leverage the program's alumni network, to continue to pro-
mote leadership development beyond graduation. Although
demographic information about participants was available,
there was no baseline information benchmarking participants'
leadership knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. It was decided
to engage 5 years of participants in a self-reported assessment
of outcomes related to learning, personal growth, professional
development, and community engagement (Pratt et al., 2000).
The evaluation design used multiple methods of inquiry, to
optimize triangulation of the data to ensure a higher degree of
reliability of the findings (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham,
1989). Specific methodologies included:
1. an extensive document review of the program's chro-
nology, reports, plans, selection criteria, participant
biographies, demographics, and previous evaluations;
2. an online survey of CITY Leaders Participant
Outcomes--based on the Leadership Program
Outcomes Measure (Black & Earnest, 2009);
3. telephone and in-person interviews with 23 key
informants including past participants (graduates),
mentors, partners, staff, and other community
stakeholders;
4. two additional online surveys: one for mentors and
one for instructors;
5. a "mini-scan" of leadership development in Toronto,
key informant interviews with six managers of other
leadership development programs and networks
across Toronto.
The online survey of program alumni was the centerpiece
of the evaluation and essentially followed the principles and
procedures of the total design method developed by Dillman
(2000). The team selected an academically validated ques-
tionnaire that had been developed by Black (2006) to evalu-
ate the outcomes and impact of executive leadership
programs and was thought to be adaptable to the CITY
Leaders program model. This questionnaire, the Leadership
Program Outcomes Measure (LPOM; Black & Earnest,
2009) was selected as the core instrument to assess the
impact of the CITY Leaders Program on participants. Dr.
Black granted permission to use and modify the instrument
for the evaluation.
The questionnaire was modified only in areas where it
was clear that the questions did not fit with our particular
population of youth and the nature of the CITY Leaders
intervention; the community outcomes section was modified
the most. We also included two additional subscales, one to
assess the components of the program and one to assess the
degree of learning experienced by graduates. As recom-
mended by Dr. Black, open-ended space for participant com-
ments and reflections was added after each of the Likert-type
scale questions. The revised questionnaire was pretested
with a small group of alumni who were not eligible to partici-
pate in the alumni survey. Reliability analysis was conducted
using Cronbach's alpha, and subscale scores had a range
from .798 to .881. This verified the internal consistency of
the scales used to assess each of the areas of outcomes and
justified our reporting of overall scores for each of the scales
used in the modified questionnaire.
The online survey was sent out to each cohort with a pro-
gram overview, to remind them of the process and content of
CITY Leaders in their year (Fan & Yan, 2010). Nevertheless,
a few respondents noted that they experienced some chal-
lenges in remembering the program, the nature of their par-
ticipation, and how they were affected. They also commented
that it was difficult to separate out changes in their lives and
attribute them solely to this intervention. Many of these
active, engaged young people have participated in multiple
other programs and networks during and after their involve-
ment in CITY Leaders.
Persistence was required to motivate past participants
to complete the online survey. UWT staff connected per-
sonally with CITY Leaders graduates to elicit their

participation, sending out a preliminary invitation to
participate in the survey, and two email reminders. The
completion deadline was extended, and every past par-
ticipant was telephoned. In the end, a total of 50 gradu-
ates responded out of the 114 surveyed for a return rate
of 44%. Nulty (2008) argues that online surveys are
much less likely to achieve response rates as high as
surveys administered on paper. It is critical, however, to
minimize non-response error by comparing the profile
of survey respondents with the composition of those
who had completed the program.
Results
CITY Leaders Participant Profile
Demographic drivers in Toronto have pushed the need for
youth leadership strategies that are solidly grounded in a cul-
tural and community context. For many reasons, youth are
engaging in civic action, organizing themselves in their own
neighborhoods and cultural communities to tackle pressing
problems, and to have a say in what happens. Still others are
showing their commitment to change by working with organi-
zations in their communities. These are the youth that CITY
Leaders sought to engage in its leadership development efforts.
CITY Leaders has also intentionally worked with culturally
diverse and sometimes marginalized youth from low-income
neighborhoods, and as a consequence, has had to develop indi-
vidual and collective leadership within a context of complex
systemic issues that are difficult to address. Participants come
to the program with impressive experience. The competitive
recruitment, referral, and selection process sought to ensure
that participants entered CITY Leaders with work and orga-
nizing experience in their own communities. Many sectoral
participants had already been involved in paid positions in the
social sector, some managing programs and staff.
The sectoral and neighborhood cohorts can be seen as
overlapping populations; the outcomes survey revealed that
there was little significant variation in their responses. Each
cohort blends a range of age, community experience, educa-
tion, and neighborhood engagement, revealing a continuum
of perspectives and experience in the overall participant
population.
The Respondents
A good cross-section of participants from all cohorts com-
pleted the outcomes survey. The demographics of the respon-
dents were representative of the CITY Leaders graduates.
·
· Gender--Female 31 (62%) and male 16 (32%; n = 47)
·
· M age--28.07 (n = 46)
·
· Cultural background--of those reporting (n = 46), 28
were African diasporic youth (60.9%; 17 African
Canadian, 11 Caribbean Canadian), eight were South/
South East Asian (17.4%), six Canadian (13%), and
six Other (13%).
Outcome Survey Results
At the core of the survey were five multi-item Likert-type
scale questions with a range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great
deal) designed to assess different aspects of program design,
participant learning, and three different levels of program
outcomes. These scales assessed:
·
· Scale 1: Program Components (nine questions)
·
· Scale 2: Learning (11 questions)
·
· Scale 3: Personal Outcomes (nine questions)
·
· Scale 4: Professional Outcomes (12 questions)
·
· Scale 5: Community Outcomes (13 questions)
Table 1 provides the overall Likert-type scores, the num-
ber of responses, the number of subscale questions, and
Cronbach's alpha for each scale.
Graduates' Assessment of Program Components
The overall assessment of the extent to which various CITY
Leader program components supported participants to learn
was 3.54 out of a possible 5 points, meaning that graduates
perceived the contribution of program components as having
an effect (some/a lot) on promoting learning and leadership.
Some of the key themes that emerged in this area include

·
· Retreats were powerful, focused investments in team
building and self-knowledge;
·
· Core program modules promoted strong conceptual
learning.
The program has been kept largely the same from a struc-
tural and content perspective, but the two streams of neigh-
borhood and sectoral participants had important differences
in learning styles and interests. These differences shaped the
delivery of the program.
Staff noted that it took courage for some neighborhood
cohort participants to participate. They had had negative
experiences in the classroom prior to the program, so it was
critical for CITY Leaders to provide a safe space to learn.
The program team worked hard to strike a balance between
high expectations of participants' performance (e.g., the
need for accountability in a certificate program) and the
critical importance of adapting the program to multiple abil-
ities and learning styles. Other themes that emerged included
the following:
·
· Program instructors added great value to the program,
promoting specialized knowledge and analysis, but
they were not well positioned to develop influential
relationships with participants.
·
· The applied learning project appears to have affected
participants unevenly and could benefit from more
proactive facilitation.
·
· UWT staff "anchor" the program by providing an
excellent level of support to participants and promot-
ing their success.
Most CITY Leaders participants were very professional as
they moved through the eight month program. Nevertheless,
the program can create emotional moments in people's lives.
Some participants come from difficult, sometimes traumatic
personal circumstances, and have required the proactive sup-
port of the CITY Leaders staff to continue in the program.
UWT staff have quietly and faithfully provided support and
encouragement to many participants. In some extreme cases,
staff have intervened to assist participants with personal cri-
ses. The fact that two of the coordinators are program gradu-
ates and the current manager has been with the program since
its inception adds a great strength to this component of the
program.
The most common mentorship activities for program par-
ticipants were supporting career planning, sharing knowl-
edge about the sector they work in, providing information
about the current employment situation, and assisting in
accessing new contacts and networks. Mentors, key infor-
mants, and graduates reported that the main challenges of the
mentorship component were related to negotiating and culti-
vating a strong working relationship between mentors and
mentees. These challenges included the need for clarity
regarding the purpose of mentorships and difficulties in
communicating and connecting. These respondents had a
number of suggestions for the improvement of the experi-
ence, including (a) a group meeting at the beginning to estab-
lish goals and expectations for mentorship, (b) increased
clarity of roles and responsibilities, (c) improved participant
screening for readiness and commitment, and (d) regular
check-ins to assess the progress of the relationship and the
achievement of goals.
It has been difficult to establish a dedicated Internet-based
network for CITY Leaders graduates under the umbrella of
UWT.At the beginning of the program, UWT had invested in
a proprietary online platform for information sharing, net-
working, and collaboration. This component did not work
well, and over time, mainstream social media (particularly
LinkedIn) provided excellent low-cost opportunities for pro-
fessional networking and exchange.
Graduates' Assessment of Learning
The survey asked graduates to assess what they had learned
through their involvement in CITY Leaders. Given that some
had been out of the program for 4 or 5 years, it was expected
that their answers would provide a more realistic assessment
of what had been useful to them, based on their experience
and employment since graduation. This section focuses on
the areas of learning that graduates assessed as making the
greatest contribution to their development as leaders. The
overall assessment of learning was M = 3.43.
Respondents (80%) reported that they had learned a lot or
a great deal about creative thinking (M = 4.0). Women were
more positive about the creative thinking session (females =
4.19; males = 3.63; t = 1.995, df = 45, p = .052). Leadership
and leadership styles was important for 78% of respondents
(M = 3.98). Graduate interviews suggested that they would
like to increase the integration of critical self-reflection and
exploration of leadership and leader styles throughout the
program.
Diversity and cultural fluency were reported as having a
moderate effect (M = 3.48), which is likely an indicator of
prior training and life experience in this area, although some
respondents commented on the positive effects of working
alongside people of different religions and cultures in the
City Leaders program. Some instructors felt that sector par-
ticipants became more knowledgeable and skilled, and
neighborhood participants became more self-aware, confi-
dent, and networked with colleagues.
The lowest scores for learning were given to social media
and social enterprise; yet, some respondents noted how these
components had been well-timed and highly influential in
their professional lives. The program team was observed as
doing an excellent job of adapting the program to the learn-
ing needs and styles of participants. Cohorts had different
personalities and were demanding in different ways. This
was a substantial challenge, since the education, age, and
experience levels within and between sectors varied widely.
8 SAGE Open
The results raise questions about how much people already
knew coming into the program and how much they could
benefit from the learning offered. Were some over-qualified
or just seeking credentials? Did the selection process target
the people who could most benefit from the content offered?
Level 1 Outcomes: Personal Change
This question exploring the personal outcomes of participa-
tion in CITY Leaders revealed that the program contributed
to significant learning, empowerment, and leadership out-
comes, with an aggregate score of M = 3.38. Although the
distinction between "personal" outcomes and "professional"
outcomes detailed in the next section may be somewhat arti-
ficial, this question explored how participants' self-percep-
tion had been changed and also revealed the process by
which the program promotes learning.
Almost three quarters of respondents (72%) reported that
"Exposure to new ideas and concepts led to my growth" a lot
or a great deal (M = 3.92). Women were significantly more
likely to say this (females = 4.13; males = 3.50; t = 2.128, df
= 45, p = .039). In addition, 60% of all respondents noted "I
improved in creative thinking" (M = 3.66). In open-ended
comments, they added that they had developed a more in-
depth analysis of social issues and a better understanding of
how the non-profit sector works. Many felt better able to
communicate effectively and articulate thoughts and ideas.
Becoming a part of this network changed my perspective of life
and my approach to life; I lost myself in all of the learning and
unlearning that CITY Leaders fosters. It took almost two years
after graduation for me to truly find myself, I feel fortunate to
have had the opportunity to unlearn all that would not serve my
ultimate purpose. . . . I didn't learn all of these lessons while in
CITY Leaders, but I would say it was the catalyst for my
re-examination of my life. (Graduate, Survey No. 13)
The research also confirmed that observational learning
among peers is a powerful way for youth to learn and try out
new behaviors. The second most frequent personal outcome
reported by 60% of respondents was that they had met "peo-
ple whose success they could imitate" (M = 3.74).
I'd never had an opportunity to sit down and engage with people
doing this work. I thought--"wow this is a 25 year old manager
in the social sector without a degree in social work . . . who looks
like me!" (Graduate, Interview No. 2)
When I came to CITY Leaders I wanted to change the world: I
had thousands of ideas. Having the opportunity to meet and
mingle with like-minded individuals allowed me to see how I
could go about achieving my goal. (Graduate, Interview No. 13)
The exploration of new ideas and behaviors within a sup-
portive community of peers is an important starting point for
leadership development. The program brings together
influential young people who would not otherwise have
met. It facilitates opportunities for peer learning, role mod-
eling, collaboration, and personal growth. Peers are role
models and sounding boards for more realistic goals, plans,
and attitudes.
The process from beginning to end gave me opportunities to
evaluate myself but also to have others give their honest
feedback about their perceptions and evaluations of me.
(Graduate, Survey No. 36)
I have struggled with the balance of personal life and professional
life--understanding which part of myself to bring to each role.
The CITY Leaders experience connected me to people who have
helped me work through this challenge. (Graduate, Survey No.
11)
Team building and developing a cohesive cohort of young
leaders have noticeably strengthened the program. Cohort
relationships are very important, and a broad diversity of
program participants contributes greatly to creativity and
learning. Graduates also developed a strong perception of
themselves as leaders, with a much clearer idea of their own
leadership styles. The program has helped participants to
integrate new perceptions and attitudes, including the notion
of service to others and the community. Interviewees in par-
ticular expressed an understanding that they could now play
a range of roles to build leadership and promote action in
their communities. CITY Leaders has increased participants'
self-confidence, empowering them to make life-changing
decisions and promote community change.
A consistent theme raised by graduates was their percep-
tion of an increased ability to promote social change or com-
munity action: 60% of respondents agreed that "CITY
Leaders helped me to realize that I have the power to make a
difference" (M = 3.70). Fifty percent of the respondents
reported an "improvement in self-confidence" (M = 3.48).
Confidence and empowerment were a huge aspect of CITY
Leaders. As a person of colour in this society it is much harder
to gain respect and feel empowered. CITY Leaders helped me
realize that I am a leader and can make positive changes.
(Graduate, Survey No. 24)
The question, "I feel more respected," was more likely to
be answered positively by the neighborhood participants (M
= 3.50) than by the sectoral participants (M = 2.53; t = 2.794,
df = 48, p = .007).
One example of life-changing decision making is that
graduates are going on to further training, certification, and
education that they might not otherwise have pursued: 29
(58%) decided to do so, as a result of their involvement in the
program. Graduates have also shifted career directions and,
as a result, modified their training/education plans. Half of
the respondents noted that "My CITY Leaders experience
began a series of life-changing events for me" (M = 3.32).
Shera and Murray 9
Again, women were also significantly more likely to note
this (females = 3.61; males = 2.81; t = 1.883, df = 45, p =
.045).
I was lacking inspiration. I was doing community work because
I was passionate but with no support, which led to my burn out
moment. When I was accepted into CITY Leaders it was a
defining day for me because from then I knew it would change
my life. (Graduate, Survey No. 34)
Level 2 Outcomes: Professional Change
Graduates reported the greatest level of change in the area of
their professional and career development (M = 3.48).
Relationships with peers and staff appear to have been the
most influential aspect of the program, leveraging profes-
sional capacity building and advancement through observa-
tional learning and role modeling. "My exposure to other
people and ideas helped me develop professionally" was
reported by 80.9% of respondents to be important (M = 4.13).
Women were more likely to say this (females = 4.39; males
= 3.63; t = 3.32, df = 45, p = .002). The program offered par-
ticipants a range of opportunities to work with peers and
mentors to explore career directions and choices. A substan-
tial 44.7% of respondents decided to change their choice of
career as a result of their involvement in CITY Leaders.
Women were far more likely to say that the program had
changed their career direction (females = 54.8%; males =
25%; 2 = 3.80, df = 1, p = .051). Open-ended responses indi-
cated that many others had clarified their career options and
the educational requirements of their career choices. The
program shifted many graduates toward more "applied"
career choices grounded in a commitment to community
development.
A prevalent theme emerging from the survey and inter-
views was that graduates have become more personally com-
mitted to the social sector. Some said they were now
interested in pursuing management track positions with
social service agencies. This theme is of particular note
because this generation has relatively high-salary expecta-
tions and talked about the difficulty of choosing between pri-
vate and not-for-profit employment. Self-employment is
increasingly an attractive option for this generation in the
face of falling investment in the sector and reduced employ-
ment opportunities. About a quarter of respondents com-
mented on their interest in pursuing more entrepreneurial
careers in the "public benefit" sector. Participants came to
the program with varying degrees of job experience and
technical skill. Through CITY Leaders, they improved their
professional skills to varying degrees. Lower outcomes
scores for technical capacity building appear not so much a
negative comment on the quality of the program content and
delivery, as much as a reflection of the high degree of skill
some participants had when they came into the program. An
estimated 20% of participants had more than 3 years of work
experience in the sector and/or advanced education coming
into the program.
Graduates have been able to deepen their professional
capacity and become more sophisticated in the way they
work. Respondents confirmed that they had used their new
skills and knowledge in their working lives: 54% reported
"improving their skills in facilitating group decision mak-
ing" (M = 3.57) and 47% "became more innovative in their
approach to problem solving" (M = 3.47). Graduates also
reported that they had experienced a change in perspective
and, as a result, a change in their professional behavior. They
have become more collaborative and cross-sectoral in their
day to day work, and they reported being able to go deeper in
their practice, improve the clarity of their objectives, and
strengthen the effectiveness of their program management
and delivery work.
Graduates improved their analysis of key political, eco-
nomic, social, and cultural issues in Toronto. They gained a
better understanding of poverty and more realistic ideas for
advocacy, policy development, and social action. They also
spoke of their increased ability to communicate and articu-
late their ideas and opinions more persuasively. Many
reported having a stronger mental map of organizations,
funding, and other resources in Toronto's social sector, and
many expressed a greater understanding and awareness of
UWT. They have integrated new ways of thinking and work-
ing into their daily professional life.
Strong professional networks were the single strongest
outcome: 74.5% reported that "CITY Leaders helped me to
build a better network of contacts" (51% a great deal and an
additional 23.5% a lot; M = 4.11). The research verified that
graduates are also extending their connections well beyond
the CITY Leaders network.
As a result of my CITY Leaders experience, I have gained the
right skills to become a better networker. Specifically, the
project we had to conduct, pushed me to make connections with
professionals in the health industry, which has now led to me
acquiring a board of directors position with a non-profit
organization and may open doors for me to obtain employment
in my field. (Graduate, Survey No. 14)
CITY Leaders itself has become a strong professional net-
work bringing graduates together as colleagues, collabora-
tors, and allies. The outcomes survey provided us with new
insights into the extent and impact of this networking:
·
· 23 (50%) network only with participants from their
own cohort
·
· 23 (50%) network with participants from their own
cohort and other cohorts
·
· None had lost touch with their own cohorts
Extensive networking among past and current partici-
pants has yielded a range of benefits. Graduates have formed
10 SAGE Open
lifelong friendships and collaborations, many have gained
critical advice and support to assist them to find and grow in
jobs, and still others have formed professional alliances that
have served to deepen their ability to affect outcomes through
their work. Interestingly, graduates have started to sub-con-
tract and hire each other. Graduates are gaining professional
power and creating a youth "voice" in their organizations
and communities. Graduate interviewees spoke of becoming
more comfortable wielding their power, both in the commu-
nity and in their organizations. More than two thirds of the
survey respondents (68.1%) also reported they are "now
more confident and better prepared to assume leadership
roles in organizations" (M = 3.89). They have deepened their
leadership identities, allowing them to take on leadership
roles with more confidence; they are more able to speak up at
work, ask for support and do other things that they had previ-
ously perceived as risk taking. Yet, more than that, the pro-
gram appears to have raised the understanding of graduates
that there is a professional field of practice within which they
can play an important leadership role.
Engaging youth to discuss critical social issues has begun
to create a uniquely young and culturally diverse "voice" and
perspective to the debate about how to solve the pressing
challenges of poverty, social inclusion, accessible transporta-
tion, community safety, public health, and food security.
Some recognized that as racialized youth, they feel excluded
from the sector. This is a critical issue for the field: Opening
doors for these young professionals is not just about connect-
ing youth to new people, events, and opportunities. It is also
about changing the psychology and perceptions both of the
sector and of youth who are seeking to engage in social
change. The research identified that CITY Leaders has begun
to change the messaging (both as internal dialogue and as
external reality) about participants' right/ability as racialized
youth in Canadian society to be a part of the social develop-
ment sector. CITY Leaders is promoting new perspectives
about what is possible, not only among the youth themselves
but also among the adults who have connected to the partici-
pants over the course of CITY Leaders.
This new, tested confidence has advanced graduates'
careers, supporting them to participate in their work and
communities in a more focused and influential way. More
than two thirds (68.1%) noted as follows: "I developed the
confidence to operate on a different level in my organization
and/or career" (M = 3.85). In addition, 46% noted the follow-
ing: "I have been promoted or have moved up to a level of
more responsibility in my work" (M = 3.17). Graduates noted
that the support, advice, connections, and opportunities they
gained from the program have given them momentum in
their careers: some are working for larger, more established
organizations, and 46% noted that "I increased my earning
power" (M = 3.22).
I was recently approached and offered a new job. I was very
unsure about whether or not this was the right role for me. My
CITY Leaders mentor guided me through the process and
assured me it was a good move. I wouldn't have been able to see
all sides of this decision without the knowledge from CITY
Leaders, and also from the direct guidance of my mentor. I
recently took the job--it is a big promotion for me and
challenging work. I'm certain that my CITY Leaders experience,
certification, and relationships helped me to get the job.
(Graduate, Survey No. 10)
Some graduates, however, experience barriers as they
bring their new knowledge and behaviors back to their orga-
nizations. Sixteen graduates (34%) had encountered a lot or
a great deal of "barriers to bringing their knowledge back to
their workplace." More women than men reported that they
have "shared the knowledge and learning from CITYLeaders
with my colleagues and/or management" (females, M = 3.94;
males, M = 3.19; t = 2.57, df = 45, p = .014).
CITY Leaders has promoted employability. For an age
demographic that has very high levels of unemployment, the
CITY Leaders graduates enjoy high-employment levels.
Only one of 50 respondents reported currently being unem-
ployed and one under-employed (although four did not
answer the question about their current employment, which
could mean that they are un/under-employed). The employ-
ment information confirms that these young professionals
are making a commitment to the social sector: 54.5% are
employed in the social services and a significant number
(11.4%) are employed in the health sector, which suggests a
possible new focus for a CITY Leaders networking session.
Respondents reported their current job titles and said that
graduates are moving into managerial stream positions as
project coordinators and program managers, on par with or
more advanced than other social-sector employees of similar
age and education. Yet, many of the graduates are employed
through time-limited, project-based funding through initia-
tives funded by the YCF, Action for Neighbourhood Change,
and the National Crime Prevention Centre.
Level 3 Outcomes: Community Engagement
Community engagement outcomes have been much more
complicated to interpret. There were lower levels of
reported change as a result of CITY Leaders (M = 2.92).
This is likely related to the fact that youth participants were
selected precisely for their prior, active involvement in
community-based organizations and in community orga-
nizing. It appears that graduates are not necessarily more
engaged, but rather that they are more deeply and effec-
tively engaged. In general, neighborhood cohorts were
much more likely to say that they had been affected at this
level by CITY Leaders. Sectoral cohorts did not necessarily
become more connected to communities but did develop a
stronger understanding of the issues and needs, developing
a stronger ability to empathize, listen, and work more effec-
tively. Sectoral participants did not necessarily connect to
neighborhoods in the same way.
Shera and Murray 11
A recurring theme in the research has been the increased
sophistication of CITY Leaders graduates in their under-
standing and analysis of complex issues, such as poverty and
managing diversity, and their enhanced political awareness.
More than half (56.5%) reported as follows: "I increased my
appreciation of cultural differences and diversity" (M = 3.39)
and 46.8% noted the following: "I have a better understand-
ing of complex issues like poverty, diversity and social
exclusion" (M = 3.38).
Graduates are also "now more committed to working for
social justice and change in my community/neighborhood"
(54.4%), (M = 3.3). Graduates also seem to also have inter-
nalized a desire to critique how the social sector currently
works and to value innovation, new practices and broader
horizons, bringing a stronger new youth perspective to the
sector.
The package of new knowledge, experience, and behav-
iors facilitated by CITY Leaders has enhanced graduates'
ability to work toward their vision for change, with 60.8%
reporting "I have a stronger vision for change in my com-
munity" (M = 3.70) and an additional 57.5% noting, "I
believe that I have new skills, tools and connections to sup-
port me to work toward that vision" (M = 3.80). CITY
Leaders appears to re-energize and bolster community activ-
ists, but this level of involvement may not be sustainable.
Thirty graduates (62.5%) reported that they are currently
doing volunteer work and are involved in a wide range of
formal and informal volunteer positions, including after
school programs, youth mentoring, community boards, and
youth associations. Some have continued actively to support
CITY Leaders, sitting on the Advisory Committee, facilitat-
ing workshops and assisting staff. Some have increased their
political involvement as they support community organizing
and join political parties.
It appears that work and school displaces volunteering to
some extent, but given that almost two thirds of CITYLeaders
graduates are volunteers, they are well ahead of the average
rate of volunteer engagement for their peers across Canada. A
2010 study of volunteering in Canada (Vézina & Crompton,
2012) found that just below half of young people aged 25 to
34 (46%) reported that they volunteer. Greater volunteer
engagement, however, received the lowest outcome scores:
about one third increased their commitment to local organiza-
tions, 23% were more active volunteers, and 24% said that
they had focused their commitment by reducing the number
of organizations at which they volunteer. More than half
(53.2%) of respondents noted that they had increased their
responsibility and authority as volunteers. The neighborhood
cluster reported a substantially higher outcome in this area
(70.6% neighborhood cluster and 43.3% sectoral). Graduates
have broadened their reach and pursued social innovation and
change through networking and collaboration.
·
· 18% have championed a new cause since joining
CITY Leaders.
·
· 45% became involved in groups and networks that
reach across Toronto.
·
· 21% have extended their involvement to the provin-
cial or national level.
Graduate Assessment of Overall Outcomes
In retrospect, alumni rated the overall change in their lives as
a result of CITY Leaders at M = 6.83 on a 10-point scale.
Women reported significantly higher overall scores (females
= 7.19; males = 6.13; t = 1.99, df = 45, p = .052). More than
two thirds (65%) of alumni felt that it was important or
extremely important to continue to offer the CITY Leaders
program. Almost all (97.9%) said that they would recom-
mend the program to their peers and colleagues.
I talk excessively about this program because it really did change
my life. I had very high expectations about this program and I
was blown away that they were exceeded and I really did
become a creative young leader. The opportunities that I have
been exposed to are invaluable. It's not just what I learned in the
classroom but everything I experienced as a result of my
involvement with this amazingly important program. We need
more leaders, keep going! The world needs you! (Graduate,
Survey No. 3)
Alumni Would Like CITY Leaders to Continue
With "Post Graduate" Activities
Previous consultations with graduates had identified a num-
ber of ways that CITY Leaders could continue to bring
alumni together and support them in their careers. Through
the survey, alumni expressed varying levels of interest in a
range of activities:
·
· 82% were very interested in providing "ongoing pro-
fessional development" opportunities for graduates.
·
· 62% were very interested in creating social opportuni-
ties for graduates to reflect, reconnect, and share
wisdom.
·
· 53% wanted to promote a "strong network presence
that supports community action" (very interested):
neighborhood (82.4%) and sectoral (40%).
·
· 46% want to "use technology creatively and strategi-
cally" to support network activities; 44% were very
interested in developing a member driven, collabora-
tive structure (very interested): neighborhood (70.6%)
and sectoral (33.3%).
Since the completion of this study, two additional
cohorts have completed the program for a final total of 149
graduates. The UWT has initiated an Alumni Network,
hosted sessions on business start-up, and navigating com-
plex service systems. They are also planning a future cross-
cohort retreat.
12 SAGE Open
What Has CITY Leaders Achieved?
City Leaders Has Contributed to Substantial
Change in Participants' Lives
CITY Leaders outcomes are significant: Alumni ratings of
change show that the program affected them in a range of ways
that have enhanced their ability to lead in organizations and
communities. Deeper qualitative analysis revealed that substan-
tial numbers of graduates experienced high degrees of change in
their lives as a result of their participation in the program.
Through a retrospective assessment of five program
cohorts over the past 5 years, this evaluation found that CITY
Leaders also created outcomes that go beyond the immediate
changes stimulated by participation to promote "develop-
mental" changes (Black & Earnest, 2009) that persist after
the intervention is over, complementing and building on one
another. The evaluation also revealed evidence of "transfor-
mative" change: fundamental shifts in attitudes and behav-
iors. There is sufficient evidence to support the belief that
these shifts will not only be maintained but will develop fur-
ther in the future (Black & Earnest, 2009; Enright, 2006;
Kress, 2006). Some of these complementary developmental
outcomes include the following:
·
· Sustained peer support and collaboration
·
· Strengthened confidence and identity as a leader
·
· Increased personal agency and self-direction
·
· Clarity and realism about educational and career
pathways
·
· Enhanced reach and professional connection to the
social sector
·
· New approaches, increased politicization, and
strengthened commitment to social change
·
· Enhanced professionalism and effectiveness
A Solid Foundation Has Been Built to Promote
Broader Change
CITY Leaders has effected change beyond the level of the
individuals targeted by the program. In their open-ended
responses, alumni identified many ways in which they had
contributed to action and change through their volunteer and
paid leadership in organizations and communities. Although
it was beyond the scope of the evaluation to measure these
changes, it was possible to identify three general areas of
onward, deepening change: sectoral strengthening, deepened
social change practice, and collaborative civic activism
(Dugan et al., 2015). Although the evidence suggests that
such changes are occurring spontaneously, there is great
potential for CITY Leaders to cultivate them more intention-
ally through work with alumni networks.
Sectoral strengthening.The CITY Leaders program is open-
ing doors for young racialized professionals (Erbstein, 2013).
Many CITY Leaders alumni have made educational and
career choices that lead them to new ways of engaging in and
supporting the social development sector, and they are gain-
ing more responsibility in their careers. There are indications
that further targeted intervention could continue to support
them to move into executive and civic leadership career
pathways.
Deepened social change practice.CITY Leaders alumni are
applying new practices in their work. They noted that they
are better at their jobs and their community organizing,
through having gained a better picture of the root causes of
the challenges they are working to resolve. They have greater
potential to promote long-term systemic change because
they now understand the need for strategic approaches that
support policy change (Marks, 2015).
Collaborative civic activism. Alumni involvement in CITY Lead-
ers has promoted their inclusion in the social development sec-
tor. Many expressed a strengthened commitment to civic
action and social development (Checkoway & Gutierrez,
2006). Their increased reach means that they are now con-
nected to leaders and networks across the Toronto region, the
province, and beyond. They are moving out of work contexts
that are functionally "siloed," cultivating new multi-sectoral
partnerships and promoting collaborative problem solving.
Great potential exists to support CITY Leaders' alumni net-
work to become a vehicle for collaborative agenda setting, to
create a legitimate, persuasive youth "voice" for Toronto.
Participant Outcomes Appear to Be Enhanced in
Diverse Groups
Targeting has been an important theme in this evaluation. It
has been difficult to draw any reliable conclusions about who
can benefit most from participation in the CITY Leader's
program although the evaluation revealed that a diverse mix
of youth have benefited from the program. The younger,
least educated and experienced participants are perceived to
have gained a great deal from the program, but it is hard to
differentiate between what they learned as a result of the pro-
gram and what they gained from the influence of a diverse
group of other older, more experienced participants in their
cohort. The more experienced, educated participants noted
that although the program content was not entirely new to
them, they had deepened their professional practice. Most
noted that participation in the program had led to enhanced
personal empowerment. These identified gains are congruent
with what has been observed in the literature (Doherty, 2003;
Enright, 2006; Russon & Reinelt, 2004; Valorose, 2015).
Future research, however, needs to focus on a more in-depth
exploration of the gender differences that were found in the
identified impacts of this leadership program (Rhee & Sigler,
2015).
Shera and Murray 13
CITY Leaders Has Created an Effective Set of
Strategies for Leadership Development
This evaluation has provided a better understanding of the
complex mix of interventions that contribute to engaging
youth and developing youth leadership. UWT has done a
remarkable job of navigating among changing and some-
times competing visions and expectations to create a chal-
lenging, open, exciting forum for learning. The evaluation
has demonstrated that CITY Leaders creates safe spaces for
youth to model and test new leadership behaviors. It offers a
set of overlapping and complementary interventions and
strategies that operate both on an individual and a collective
level (Figure 1). This evaluation identified the following
interventions that appear to be mutually supportive in pro-
moting youth leadership outcomes.
·
· Building connections that otherwise would not hap-
pen--Promoting relationships between peers, and
with mentors, instructors, and new networks.
·
· Facilitating a peer community and observational
learning--Promoting a supportive environment of
trust and respect that creates new learning opportuni-
ties through role modeling and team building.
·
· Introducing new ideas, values, and knowledge--
Integrating diversity, leadership, creative problem
solving, collaboration, and social justice into new
approaches.
·
· Co-creating the big picture--Facilitating a more con-
fident, sophisticated analysis of the systemic forces
that produce poverty and exclusion in Toronto and
creating an understanding of the structure and
resources of the social sector. This builds a more real-
istic, youth-led, collective vision for social change.
·
· Promoting critical self-assessment--Supporting a
better assessment of each participant's personal assets
and aptitudes, providing an understanding of personal
decision making and leadership styles, promoting
self-direction in pursuing goals and opportunities, and
benchmarking progress.

·
· Enhancing professional skills and capacity--
Enhancing technical skills, professional knowledge,
and access to job and career advice with a view to
building professional competence.
·
· Providing access to new opportunities--Opening
doors to new contacts and hands-on learning opportu-
nities that allow alumni to try out new ideas, skills,
and approaches (e.g., collective learning projects,
jobs, conferences, round tables, workshops, "experts,"
networks, and political parties).
This evaluation offers compelling evidence that UWT
has made an important investment in a generation of
young leaders who will continue working together and
will influence the direction of the social sector in the
decades to come. The cohesion and influence of this group
is likely to grow significantly in the coming years.
Feedback from interviews and surveys, however, suggests
that the model currently being delivered may not be the
most effective configuration of these strategies.
Respondents suggested a number of changes to the pro-
gram including strengthening the pedagogical anchoring
of the program to enhance the links between different
components and sessions, changing the structure and tim-
ing of the mentorship program, extending CITY Leaders
programming to serve graduates, and linking the CITY
Leaders participants more strongly to community agen-
cies and other leadership networks. The new insights
derived from this in-depth investigation of the CITY
Leaders Program will hopefully be instructive to other
groups and organizations that are undertaking leadership
development initiatives in their own communities.
