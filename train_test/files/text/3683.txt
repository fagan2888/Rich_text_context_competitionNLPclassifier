Introduction
Video games (VGs) are among the most popular recreational
activities of children and adolescents. More than two thirds
of 6- to 17-year-old Italians (AESVI-ISPO, 2010) and of 16-
to 19-year-old Europeans regularly use them (Interactive
Software Federation of Europe, 2010). VG contents are often
violent, requiring the player to overtly injure or kill "ene-
mies" to progress in the game. These contents are often dis-
played with a very high degree of realism, due to the fast and
constant technological evolution of consoles and personal
computers.
As Gentile and Gentile (2008) point out, VGs are "exem-
plary teachers" and are among the most effective learning
tools available to youth. Thus, the possibility of realistically
mimicking aggressive behaviors could lead the player to
learn and practice violent scripts. Regarding the outcomes of
this "training," short- and long-term effects of interaction
with violent VGs were studied in the literature as early as the
1980s. Early results from the 1980s' and 1990s' research
highlighted that exposure to violent VGs could encourage
aggressive cognitions and behaviors in young players (cf.
Adachi & Willoughby, 2011; Anderson et al., 2003; Kirsh,
2006).
From the 2000s, this field of study flourished, including
experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal research as
well as meta-analyses. A substantial body of research of vari-
ous types--cross-sectional (Anderson & Dill, 2000;Anderson,
Gentile, & Buckley, 2007; Funk, Baldacci, Pasold, &
Baumgardner, 2004; Gentile, Lynch, Linder, & Walsh, 2004;
Kirsh, 2006; Krahé & Möller, 2004), longitudinal (Anderson
et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2008; Gentile, Coyne, & Walsh,
2010; Hofferth, 2010; Ihori, Sakamoto, Kobayashi, & Kimura,
2003; Möller & Krahé, 2009), and experimental (Anderson &
Carnagey, 2009; Anderson & Dill, 2000; Carnagey, Anderson,
& Bushman, 2007; Greitemeyer, 2014; Hasan, Bègue, &
Bushman, 2013; Kim & Sundar, 2013; Kirsh, 1998; Lee, Peng,
& Klein, 2010; Saleem, Anderson, & Gentile, 2012; Sestir &
Bartholow, 2010; Uhlmann & Swanson, 2004; Ybarra,
Huesmann, Korchmaros, & Reisner, 2014)--show a very
likely causal relationship between the habitual use of violent
VGs and the presence of aggressive thoughts and behaviors in
children and adolescents. Violent VG playing is correlated not
only with those measures of aggression usually implemented
in experimental studies (e.g., administering loud noises to
other participants) but also with more serious forms of aggres-
sion such as antisocial and delinquent behavior (cf. DeLisi,
Vaughn, Gentile, Anderson, & Shook, 2013). Also, recent

Abstract
The literature provides some evidence that the use of violent video games increases the risk for young people to develop
aggressive cognitions and even behaviors. We aimed to verify whether exposure to violent video games is linked to problems
of aggression in a sample of Italian children. Four questionnaires were administered to 346 children between 7 and 14 years
of age, attending primary and secondary schools in Northern Italy. Variables measured were externalization, quality of
interpersonal relationships, aggression, quality of coping strategies, and parental stress. Participants who preferred violent
games showed higher scores for externalization and aggression. The use of violent video games and age were linked to higher
levels of aggression, coping strategies, and the habitual video game weekly consumption of participants. Our data confirm the
role of violent video games as risk factors for problems of aggressive behavior and of externalization in childhood and early
adolescence.

research shows that the preference for violent VGs is associ-
ated with measures of sadism in everyday life (Greitemeyer,
2015). Finally, meta-analyses confirm these findings:
Anderson et al. (2010) considered 136 different studies (total
N = 130,534) and verified that exposure to violence in VGs is,
on the whole, positively associated with aggressive behavior,
aggressive cognitions, and physiological arousal, and nega-
tively associated with empathy and prosocial behavior. A
recent meta-analysis by Greitemeyer and Mügge (2014) con-
firmed these results, and showed that violent VGs increase
aggression and decrease prosocial behaviors, while prosocial
VGs promote prosocial outcomes.
The interplay between use of violent media--and spe-
cifically violent VGs--and the consequences on children
and adults was analyzed according to a number of theories
such as Cognitive Association Theory, Social Learning
Theory, and Script Theory (for a review, see Anderson &
Bushman, 2002). More recently, the General Aggression
Model (GAM; Anderson & Bushman, 2002; Anderson &
Carnagey, 2004; Anderson et al., 2007; De Wall &
Anderson, 2011) has been established as one of the most
influential models in explaining the effects of exposure to
violent media on human aggressiveness. The model dis-
criminates between distal factors (which influence behav-
ior in the long term) and proximal factors (which influence
behavior in the short term: Violent VG use is an example of
a proximal factor). The model stresses an individual's dis-
positional variables (e.g., personality), biological/physio-
logical variables, and environmental variables. These
variables are taken to assume the role of a "background" on
which proximal processes occur, both influencing the actual
behavior and engaging as feedback on the distal processes.
In the long term, these factors affect the personality, the
physiological processes, and the environment of the person.
According to GAM, the reiteration of aggressive conduct
will influence future social behavior, modifying both the
individual and his or her context. On the whole, GAM is
considered an empirically validated model that integrates
the effects of violent VGs on aggression into a comprehen-
sive theoretical framework.
A Risk and Resilience Framework for VG Use
Research has recently proposed a risk-resilience framework
with regard to the effects of violent VG on aggression. As
Gentile and Bushman (2012) point out, using violent media
could be seen as just one among various risk factors for sub-
sequent aggressive behavior, such as hostile attribution bias,
prior involvement in a physical fight, gender, and prior phys-
ical victimization. Thus, being exposed to violent VGs is not
the only factor that potentially predicts aggression. This
exposure--to exert detectable effects on the user--must link
with other risk factors with a reciprocal exacerbating down-
spiral effect (cf. Slater, Henry, Swaim, & Anderson, 2003).
In this view, the fact that most children never commit an act
of overt aggression despite having possibly consumed a lot
of media and VG violence is explained by the existence of
protective factors, such as parental involvement in the use of
media and VGs (Gentile, Reimer, Nathanson, Walsh, &
Eisenmann, 2014).
The degree of violence of VGs is not the only variable
taken into account as a risk factor. Also, the amount of VG
playing seems to be correlated with measures of aggression
in childhood and adolescence. As Kuntsche (2004) and
Wallenius, Punamäki, and Rimpelä (2007) point out, more
hours per week of VG playing were correlated with measures
of aggression. Usually, children who prefer violent VGs are
likely to play with VGs for more hours than children who
play non-violent VGs (cf. Olson et al., 2007).
With reference to the interplay between age and use of
violent VGs, von Salisch, Vogelgesang, Kristen, and Oppl
(2011) point out that there seem to be some differences
between primary school children and early teenagers. In pri-
mary school, the preference for VGs rises from 42% of first
graders to 86% of sixth graders (cf. Feierabend & Rathgeb,
2009), signaling an emerging interest in VGs, including vio-
lent ones. Not surprisingly, von Salisch et al. found that in
this age group, it seems that the selection hypothesis (e.g.,
more aggressive children tend to choose more violent VGs)
prevails over the socialization hypothesis (e.g., using more
violent VG puts children at risk of developing aggression
problems). This is due to a progression of preference forma-
tion: Children first experiment with different types of VGs,
then they differentiate and refine their preference for specific
types of electronic games. Literature has not yet completely
addressed other potential risk and protective factors in the
association between use of violent VGs and increase in vio-
lent behaviors. At the moment, at least three dimensions that
are highly relevant from a developmental point of view have
been overlooked in the literature: quality of interpersonal
relations, emotional and cognitive coping strategies, and
parent­child relationship. To date, the literature has not yet
assessed the possible correlation between violent VG use and
interpersonal relations (cf. Homer, Hayward, Frye, & Plass,
2012).
Likewise, the relation between coping strategies and
interaction with violent VGs has received little attention in
the literature. A notable exception is the work from Reinecke
(2009), which highlights that using VGs for recovering from
stress and pain is linked with emotion-focused coping strate-
gies. On a broader perspective, video gaming seems to pres-
ent some cognitive and emotional overlapping with those
coping strategies considered less adaptive, such as avoidance
and distraction. However, to our knowledge to date, no
research has specifically addressed video gaming as a coping
strategy. Olson (2010) pointed out that children often report
using VGs as a means to regulate their feelings, but the pre-
cise nature of coping strategy could not be determined
because results were derived from a survey and not from a
standardized coping measure.
Milani et al. 3
Finally, with regard to the third point of interest, we could
hypothesize an interaction between the use of violent VGs and
difficulties in the parent­child relationship. We could think
that a parent who has to deal with an aggressive child could
feel stuck and immobilized into a stressful relationship with
his or her son/daughter. The opposite could also hold true: A
child whose parent is lacking responsivity due to a high level
of stress could use violent VGs--which are often the most
thrilling and immersive--as a means to momentarily escape
from this difficult relationship. To date, to our knowledge, no
research has addressed this issue, nor tested this hypothesis.
Aims of the Research
The research has the general aim of verifying in an Italian
sample whether the preference for violent VGs is linked to
problems of aggressive behavior, of externalization, of inter-
personal relations, to worse coping strategies, and to parental
stress. More specifically, it is hypothesized that,
Hypothesis 1: Participants who prefer to use VGs with
violent content present more problems of aggressiveness
and externalization than participants who do not use vio-
lent VGs.
Hypothesis 2: Participants who prefer to use VGs with
violent content present more interpersonal problems than
participants who do not use violent VGs.
Hypothesis 3: Participants who use VGs with violent con-
tent show a preference for those coping strategies consid-
ered less adaptive in developmental terms (i.e., distraction
coping and avoidance coping; cf. Fields & Prinz, 1997).
Hypothesis 4: Participants who use VGs with violent
content show a more stressful relation with parents than
participants who do not use violent VGs.
Method
Participants
Questionnaire packets were delivered to 471 children attend-
ing primary and secondary schools in Northern Italy. Of these,
125 (26.53%) questionnaire packets were discarded because
one or more of the questionnaires were not completely
answered. The 346 remaining participants were between 7 and
14 years old (M = 11.64; SD = 1.17). The participants were
evenly divided by gender, with 170 male participants (49.1%;
mean age = 11.66; SD = 1.16) and 176 female participants
(50.9%; mean age = 11.63; SD = 1.17). Participants were from
the middle class (data assumed via a demographic question-
naire). All participants were of Caucasian ethnicity.
Procedure
Heads of the schools approved the school's participation in
the research project, agreed to the collection of data, and
informed the parents about the research. Researchers then
explained the research to the students and gave them an
envelope to be handed over to their parents. The envelope
included a document that described in detail the methodol-
ogy, aims of the research, and the contact information of the
experimenter in charge of the research; a consent form to be
signed by both parents prior to the administration of the
instruments; and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and
Parenting Stress Index (PSI) questionnaires (cf. below) to be
compiled together by both parents if they agreed to partici-
pate in the research. The following day, experimenters pre-
sented the research to the classrooms involved in the data
collection, collected the signed consent forms and the com-
piled questionnaires, and collectively administered the ques-
tionnaires to the children whose parents granted consent.
Participants were made aware that they could withdraw from
the research at any moment.
Measures Administered to Children
Interpersonal relations. TRI (Test delle relazioni interperson-
ali [Test of Interpersonal Relations]; Bracken, 1993; Italian
version: Ianes, 1996) is composed of 105 items on a 1 to 4
Likert-type scale and measures the quality of interpersonal
relationships (example of an item: "I am treated fairly by my
mother"). The scale assesses the overall quality of relation-
ships and the quality of relations in specific domains: with
parents, with peers, and with teachers. Only the overall score
of interpersonal relations was considered for this study.
Cronbach's alpha was .96 for the overall score.
Coping strategies.CCSC-R1 (Children's Coping Strategies
Checklist­Revised 1; Ayers & Sandler, 2009; Italian version:
Camisasca, Caravita, Milani, & Di Blasio, 2012). The instru-
ment measures the preferential cognitive strategies used by
children and adolescents to cope with situations perceived as
problematic or stressful. It consists of 54 items on a 1 to 4
Likert-type scale (example of an item: "When I have a prob-
lem, I listen to music"). The instrument provides four scales
for the following coping strategies: Active, Support Seeking,
Avoidance, and Distraction. The highest score of the four
scales indicates the subject's preferred coping strategy. Cron-
bach's alphas were .81 for the Active scale, .79 for the Sup-
port Seeking scale, .77 for the Avoidance scale, and .79 for
the Distraction scale.
Aggression.AFV (Indicatori della capacità di adattamento
sociale in età evolutiva­Aggressività Fisica e Verbale [Indi-
cators of Physical and Verbal Aggression]; Caprara, Pas-
torelli, Barbaranelli, & Vallone, 1992). The instrument
measures the tendency to commit aggressive physical and
verbal acts by means of 15 items on a 1 to 3 Likert-type scale
(example of an item: "I happen to have the impulse to hit
someone").1 It provides a single overall score of aggressive
behavior. Cronbach's alpha was .84.
4 SAGE Open
Ad hoc questionnaire for VG habits. Instrument comprised of
13 items: 7 open questions and 6 questions on a 1 to 10 Lik-
ert-type scale. The questionnaire was developed to investi-
gate habits in the use of VGs, including the level of violence
of the preferred VGs and the amount of VG use. For this
research, two factors were taken into consideration: the pref-
erential use of violent VGs and the frequency of use of VGs
per week (independently of their content). Participants were
requested to specify their three preferred VG titles in the last
year. Subsequently, VG titles were categorized as "violent"
or "non-violent" by two independent double-blind raters,
who are expert2 in VGs (Cohen's k = .830). Participants who
mentioned at least two violent VGs were categorized as vio-
lent VG users. The rating of VGs was coherent with the Pan
European Game Information (PEGI) rating for all VGs (cf.
Milani, Camisasca, Caravita, & Di Blasio, 2012). Moreover,
the degree of violence in the VGs used by each participant
was computed by multiplying the violent content and the
weekly time spent on VGs (similarly to Gentile et al., 2014).
Measures Administered to Parents
Externalization.CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist; Achen-
bach, 1991; Italian version: Frigerio, 2001). The instrument
measures adjustment problems in children and adolescents
and is comprised of 112 items on a 1 to 3 Likert-type scale,
requiring parents to rate how often each applies for his or her
child (example of an item: "Can't concentrate, can't pay
attention for long"). It consists of eight syndromic scales and
two general scales of Internalization and Externalization.
This article is concerned with scores more relevant to behav-
ioral problems: Externalization, Aggressive behavior, and
Delinquent behavior. Cronbach's alphas were as follows: for
Externalization .87, for Aggressive behavior .82, and for
Delinquent behavior .84.
Parenting stress. PSI (Parenting Stress Index; Abidin, 1995;
Italian version: Guarino, Di Blasio, D'Alessio, Camisasca, &
Serantoni, 2008). The instrument measures the degree of
stress experienced by a parent while exercising his or her
parental role. The measure consists of 36 items on a 1 to 5
Likert-type scale and provides a general score of parental
stress (example of an item: "I feel trapped by my responsi-
bilities as a parent"). Cronbach's alpha was .81.
Results
Data Analysis Strategy
Data were analyzed following a three-step strategy. First,
descriptive analyses were performed on the sample. Second,
two sets of student's t tests and chi square tests were performed
to assess gender differences and differences between users and
non-users of violent VGs. Third, two sets of three-step hierar-
chical regressions were performed to verify the association of
violent VG use with externalization (CBCL) and aggression
(AFV). Hierarchical regressions were performed to highlight
the contribution of each single potential predictor of external-
ization and aggression. In particular, we decided to adopt a
three-step approach to single out the relative contribution to
variance of the following subsets of variables: (a) the habitual
use of violent VGs; (b) demographic variables such as age and
gender; and (c) other potential predictors of problems of
aggression such as coping strategies (CCSC-R1), parental
stress (PSI), and quality of relationships (TRI).
Descriptive Statistics
All the participants (100.0%) played VGs (97.7% owned a
specific VG machine; that is, personal computer and/or
VG console) for an average of 6.84 hr per week (SD =
7.24; range = 0-42). One third (33.5%) of participants
(N = 116) habitually used violent VGs, and the degree of
violence in the VGs used by the participants ranged from 0
to 84 (M = 10.25). The mean score for aggression (AFV)
was 15.99 (SD = 3.68). This score is comparable to that of
the general population (cf. Caprara et al., 1992).The CBCL
Externalization mean score was 9.20 (SD = 6.48); 88.6%
of participants were in the non-clinical range. These distri-
butions also are in line with those of the general population
(cf. Frigerio, 2001). The prevalent coping strategy was
Distraction (37.9%), followed by Active (24.6%), Support
Seeking (20.8%), and Avoidance (16.8%). The mean score
for parenting stress (PSI) was 68.42 (SD = 17.31), and also
this score is in line with that of the general population (cf.
Guarino et al., 2008).
Gender Differences
Boys obtained higher aggression scores than girls in the AFV
(16.87 vs. 15.14; t = 4.47; p < .001) and in the number of
hours per week spent using VG (8.42 vs. 5.31; t = 4.07; p <
.001). Boys also used more frequently violent games than
girls (54.1% vs. 13.63%), 2 (1) = 65.58, p < .001, and their
score of violence in VGs was higher (14.12 vs. 6.44),
t = 5.81, p < .001. These differences were expected and are
coherent with the literature (Caprara et al., 1992; Olson et al.,
2007). No gender differences emerged concerning the qual-
ity of relationships (TRI), coping strategies (CCSC-R1), and
parenting stress (PSI).
Differences Between Users and Non-Users of
Violent VGs
As shown in Table 1, the participants in our sample who
use violent VGs showed higher scores on externalization
(CBCL), aggression (AFV scale), and on avoidance coping
(CCSC-R1). They also used VGs for more hours per week,
and are older. No significant differences were found
regarding the quality of interpersonal relations (TRI), the
Milani et al. 5
three remaining coping strategies (CCSC-R1), or the dis-
tribution of frequency for the coping strategy preferen-
tially used, 2 (3) = 2.42, p > .05. Data are presented in
Table 1.
Regression Analyses
To further test the four hypotheses, two sets of three-step
hierarchical regressions were performed. In the first regres-
sion model, the aggression score (AFV) was inserted as cri-
terion variable, and the following variables were inserted as
predictors: preferential use of violent VGs [Step 1], age and
gender [Step 2], coping strategies (four CCSC-R1 scores),
quality of relationships (TRI), and parental stress (PSI) [Step
3]. In the second regression model, the externalization score
(CBCL) was inserted as criterion variable, and the following
variables were inserted as predictors: preferential use of vio-
lent VGs [Step 1], age and gender [Step 2], coping strategies
(four CCSC-R1 scores), quality of relationships (TRI), and
parental stress (PSI) [Step 3]. As can be seen in Table 2, pref-
erential use of violent VGs remains a significant predictor of
problems of aggression in all three steps. Even when other
potential risk factors for aggression such as parental stress,
dysfunctional coping strategies, and interpersonal relations
are inserted in the model, the preferential use of violent VGs
remains the more relevant predictor of aggressive problems.
Moreover, the increase in R2 is non-significant from Step 2 to
Step 3: Inserting the other potential risk factors do not
enhance the model, R2 = .19, F(6, 342) = 1.34, p > .05. On
the contrary, as shown in Table 3, with regard to externaliza-
tion, the preferential use of violent VGs is a significant
predictor in Steps 1 and 2 but not in Step 3. In Step 3, the
predictive weight of parental stress and interpersonal rela-
tionships overshadows the use of violent VGs. Moreover, the
increase in R2 from Step 2 to Step 3 is very significant,
R2 = .33, F(6, 342) = 30.87, p < .001.

Discussion
The results of this study support acceptance of Hypotheses 1
and 3 and rejection of Hypotheses 2 and 4.
In particular, participants who use violent VGs show more
externalizing problems, more aggression, and more avoidant
coping strategies compared with participants who do not use
violent VGs. They also tend to use VGs for more hours per
week compared with participants who do not use violent
VGs. Also, users of violent VGs are older than users of non-
violent VGs. This result seems to support von Salisch et al.'s
(2011) "progression" in the development of a preference for
violent VGs: Younger children tend to experiment with dif-
ferent types of VGs, and the more aggressive of them choose
violent VGs over non-violent ones in keeping with the
"selection hypothesis."
On the whole, the results allow us to draw some conclu-
sions. First, there is an association between the preferential
use of VGs with violent content and problems of aggression.
Our data show that the users of violent games obtained
higher scores on all the scales related to problems of aggres-
siveness, namely, AFV and CBCL externalization. This
result seems to be solid, as it has not only been found by
contrasting via t tests the two populations of users and non-
users of violent VGs but also been confirmed in the two
models of regression analysis.
However, with regard, more specifically, to problems of
externalization, the habitual use of violent VGs seems to be
less relevant as a predictor than other--more significant--risk
factors such as parental stress and interpersonal relations.
Using violent VGs seems to put minors at risk of developing
externalizing problems only in the presence of other more sig-
nificant risk factors. This result seems to be quite in line with
the literature, as shown by Gentile and Bushman (2012):
Violent media exposure is not the most important risk factor
for developmental problems, when other more contextual risk
factors are taken into account. Moreover, the construct of
externalization itself is an overarching developmental out-
come that encompasses different problems and not just those
of aggression (i.e., attention problems, defiant and rule-break-
ing behavior). Thus, it seems understandable that the associa-
tion of a rather proximal and limited risk factor such as violent
VG exposure with externalization ceases to be detectable
when more contextual factors enter into play. Nonetheless, our
data seem to confirm the role of violent VGs as a potential risk
factor for problems of aggressive behavior and of externaliza-
tion. Again, as the literature points out, it is unlikely that using
violent VGs alone could be a necessary or sufficient cause for
an increase in aggression or externalizing behavior. Rather, it
is the combination of multiple risk factors that increases the
risk of aggression or externalizing behavior (cf. Gentile &
Bushman, 2012).
The outcomes of our research, of course, can hardly be
considered definitive as we could not control the effect of
other potential mediating variables such as the general atti-
tude toward aggressiveness witnessed by the child in his or
her family and proximal environment, the degree of involve-
ment of parents in children's play with VGs, the level of cog-
nitive development of the child or preadolescent, or--more
generally--the child's temperament and personality traits.
However, as longitudinal research on the topic points out, the
effects of violent VGs upon aggressive behavior and cogni-
tions seem to be more relevant than the effects of violent
behavior and cognitions upon the choice of VGs. In other
words, the socialization hypothesis is more relevant than the
selection hypothesis (cf. Möller & Krahé, 2009), at least for
older children and early teenagers. Moreover, as the "down-
ward spiral" effect suggests (cf. Slater et al., 2003; von
Salisch et al., 2011), the more a child chooses violent VGs,
the more he or she will be reinforced in aggressive thoughts
and representations, which in turn will lead him or her to opt
for violent VGs. Moving from these assumptions, it is likely
that also in our sample, the correlation between the use of
violent VGs can be ascribed to the socialization hypothesis:
Children who spend more time playing more violent VGs are
at risk of developing problems of aggression.
With regard to coping strategies, a significant difference
emerged between users and non-users of violent VGs.
Participants who use violent VGs have higher scores in the
Avoidance Coping as measured by the CCSC-R1. From a cog-
nitive point of view, this result suggests that there could be an
overlap between the decision of playing a violent VG and the
efforts to avoid disturbing thoughts. Given the fact that violent
video games are often the most enthralling from a perceptive

point of view, this result is not surprising. The work from
Reinecke (2009) seems to support this hypothesis.
Unfortunately, with regard to coping strategies, at the
moment, our data do not allow us to assess whether playing
VGs puts youth at risk of being more aggressive or whether
it is used as a means to canalize troubling thoughts and
impulses. Both explications could hold true at the same time:
A child who habitually chooses to play violent VGs becomes
slightly more prone to aggressive thoughts and cognitions. In
turn, when troubled by something, this child could resort
more easily to violent VGs as a means to cope with the situ-
ation, possibly due to more violent game-related cognitions
and also to the availability of more violent game titles in his
or her gaming library. Indeed, sometimes children use VGs
also as a mean to regulate feelings (cf. Olson, 2010). What
remains still unclear is whether children specifically choose
violent VGs over non-violent VGs as a coping strategy, par-
ticularly when they need to deal with aggressive thoughts.
Some results from Olson et al. (2007) seem to support this
view, but more research is needed about this issue.
Contrary to our expectations, neither parenting stress nor
the quality of interpersonal relations added a significant con-
tribution to the model. With regard to the first, it could be
argued that parenting stress is quite a distal factor in the
interplay between familial relational and emotional climate
and children's management of free-time activities. Of course,
parental stress has a great impact upon the overall family
climate, but it is difficult to single out a clear significant
effect of parenting stress upon the children's media choice.
Ferguson, San Miguel, and Hartley (2009), in fact, showed
that although the family climate--in terms of negative rela-
tions with adults and family conflict--was a potential pre-
dictor of aggression, it was not specifically correlated with
the use of violent VGs. More research is needed on this topic
to clarify the impact of family climate--and particularly of
parental stress--upon the media choice of children.
With regard to interpersonal relations, Goldstein (1999)
argues that--at least for boys--violent VGs (and violent
media in general) could actually be a means for bonding
relationships with peers. Jansz (2005), in fact, remarks that
male adolescents in particular could decide for a violent
VG over a non-violent VG also due to their potential for
socializing with peers' negative emotions such as anger,
fear, and disgust, and for sharing insecurities related with
the acquisition of a more adult identity. Olson, Kutner, and
Warner (2008) found similar results in a series of focus
groups with young video gamers. Olson et al. (2007) found
that the use of violent or M-rated VGs in childhood and
preadolescence is linked with social play with friends,
rather than with solitary activities. Olson et al. (2009),
finally, speculate that the use of M-rated VGs could be seen
as normative, at least for boys, in preadolescence. Thus, we
could conclude that, from this point of view, the use of vio-
lent VGs could be expected and even be highly regarded by
peers, especially by male teenagers.
Limitations and Future Directions
The research presents some limitations. First, the question-
naires administered--although being appropriate for the
measurement of variables of interest--are self-report. While
our study included multiple informants (children and par-
ents), it would be appropriate to include measures from more
sources (e.g., teachers).
Second, the instrument on Coping was not specifically
designed to assess the use of VGs as a specific coping strat-
egy. Thus, data about coping strategies need to be considered
conservatively as participants were not specifically asked if
they used VGs as a means to deal with stress or difficulties.
Third, the most evident limitation of the research is its
correlational methodology. The presence of simple relations
of co-presence between the use of violent VGs and problems
of aggressiveness does not allow us to draw any conclusion
in terms of causality. Future longitudinal studies will allow
the amending of these limitations and consolidate these pre-
liminary results.
To conclude, this research seems to confirm the general
results of the international literature also in the Italian set-
ting. The connection between the use of violent VGs and
problems of aggressiveness in children and preadolescents
seems to be quite solid.
