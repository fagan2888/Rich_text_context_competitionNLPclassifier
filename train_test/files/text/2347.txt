Abstract
Recent studies suggest that obesity may be ``contagious'' between individuals in social networks. Social contagion
(influence), however, may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because they cannot distinguish
contagion from homophily (the propensity for individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from shared
environmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by
Snijders and colleagues to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing active sports. Our primary
hypothesis was that social influences on adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend selection.
Employing the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and
structural characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the 2 largest schools in the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by examining the 2 school
networks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social
influence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in either school, while only one of the schools
showed homophily on playing active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on screen time in one of the
schools, and playing active sports in both schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence are
important in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity. Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers'
influence on one another, rather than treating ``high risk'' adolescents in isolation.

Introduction
Childhood obesity is epidemic in the U.S. [1,2]. Recent data
show that that 18.1% of adolescents (ages 12­19 years old) are
obese (defined as exceeding the historical 95th percentile of age-
and sex-specific body mass index (BMI)) [3]. By contrast, the
prevalence of U.S. adolescent obesity in the period 1988­1994 was
10.7% [4]. To reverse the alarming rise in childhood and
adolescent obesity
`, researchers have tried many individual-level
prevention strategies, including educating children on healthy
eating habits, promoting increased physical activity
`, and restricting
screen time. Most interventions, however, have shown, at most,
modest benefit. For example, a 2011 Cochrane Review by Waters
and colleagues showed that interventions aimed at reducing
obesity in 13-to-18 year old adolescents lowered BMI by an
average of 0.09 kg/m2 [5]. The failure of these interventions,
especially those targeting individuals, has spurred researchers to
identify social and economic influences and suggest novel
population-level interventions [6]. Along these lines, recent studies
support an etiologic role for social networks in the production and
maintenance of childhood and adult obesity [7,8,9,10].
Social relationships and interactions generally influence behav-
iors and health outcomes [11,12]. We may represent the pattern of
relationships between ``social entities'' as a social network; the
entities might be individuals, collectives (such as households),
institutions, or governments [13]. Social networks are increasingly
regarded as important determinants of health issues as diverse as
the spread of human immunodeficiency virus [14] and the
``contagion'' of several conditions including obesity [7], smoking
[15,16,17], and even happiness [18]. Valente has further shown
the importance of social networks in the diffusion of health-related
innovations and behaviors [19]. The specific mechanisms by
which networks influence behavior are poorly understood,
although norms [11,20], peer modeling [21], and social capital
[22] have all been implicated.
Notable critiques of the social network ``contagion'' hypothesis
have appeared in academic [23,24,25,26] and popular [27]
literatures. The key issues highlighted by these critiques are a trio
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39795
of potential mechanisms that could account for the observed
``network contagion'': 1) social influence; 2) confounding by shared
social environments of network members; and 3) social selection or
homophily (``love of sameness'') on shared predisposition to engage
in (un)healthy behaviors. These mechanisms are not identifiable
using traditional statistical approaches. This trio has been a
longstanding problem in epidemiology and other fields, and is best
articulated by Manski as the ``reflection problem'', because all
three mechanisms can mirror one another [28]. The critique is
most sharply articulated by Shalizi and Thomas [26]. Using
graphical causal models, they show that those aspects of latent
traits that lead to either friendship formation or behavior ``must be
made observable... In either case the confounding arcs go away,
and the direct effect [of peer influence] becomes identifiable''
([26], p.218).
Several prior studies have employed regression-based approach-
es to adolescent obesity or BMI using data drawn from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [24,25,29].
These studies all claim to control for confounding by holding
constant individual background characteristics that influence
behavior. Cohen-Cole and Fletcher offer perhaps the best example
of a regression-based approach [24] as their model adds controls
for environmental confounding using school-specific trends; these
controls alone attenuate the association by over 30%. They further
extend Christakis and Fowler's model by examining the change in
BMI following declaration of friendship using individual fixed
effects (FE). The FE model is appealing because it automatically
adjusts for all time-invariant background characteristics of
individuals, whether or not these characteristics are observed.
The stochastic actor-based model (SABM) of Snijders and
colleagues provides a means of separating the effects of social
influence and friend selection [30,31]. The SABM simultaneously
models the evolution of social network structure and the behavior
of individuals in the network. In this paper, we apply the stochastic
actor-based framework to data on adolescent body size and
obesity-related behavior. Our primary hypothesis was that social
influences on adolescent body size and obesity-related behavior
are independent of peer selection when stratified by the school
environment. We predicted that peers exert an influence on one
another's BMI, screen time, and playing active sports; these
influences are assumed to be localized in the social network and
were operationalized as assimilation (i.e., individual becoming
more similar to their friends).
Methods
The Loyola University Chicago Institutional Review Board
approved these analyses. All subject data were de-identified prior
to receipt of the data by the investigators, and the study was
deemed ``exempt''.
Study Population
Data were drawn from the first and second waves of the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (hereafter, Add
Health). Details of the overall study design, including codebooks,
may be found elsewhere [32]. Add Health invited all students at 16
schools to participate in a detailed survey conducted in the
student's home. Only 2 schools enrolled enough students to permit
school-stratified analyses and thus only 2 schools are included in
the current study, referred to as ``Jefferson High'' by Bearman [33]
and ``Sunshine High'' by Moody (unpublished data). Jefferson
High, located in the rural Midwest, is the only public high school
in the area, which is critical because friendships can only be
identified if they are within the school. Jefferson High is primarily
comprised of non-Hispanic white students. Sunshine High is in an
urban environment and has substantial racial and ethnic diversity;
this makes it an ideal contrast to the more homogeneous
population of Jefferson High.
The total student participation rates were 776 (75.8%) at
Jefferson High and 1744 (82.9%) at Sunshine High. Wave 1 was
collected during the 1994­1995 school year a follow-up visit took
place 1 year later (Wave 2). Because we are interested in
longitudinal changes in the social network, we excluded any
respondent not followed in Wave 2, which, for the most part,
included those who were 12th graders in Wave 1. This yielded a
final dataset of 624 students in Jefferson High and 1151 students in
Sunshine High for analysis. The remaining schools in the
saturation sample (i.e., those not included in this study) only
included from 19 to 133 students with complete BMI information;
they were not included because of their low sample sizes which
would have precluded disentangling peer influence from social
selection. To rule out unmeasured confounders at the school level,
we stratified all analyses by school.
Obesity-related Measures
Body size was assessed by BMI (in kg per meters squared); both
weight and height were self-reported, as Wave 1 lacked objective
measures of these variables. Although self-reported weight was
found to be under-reported in Wave 2 of Add Health, the amount
was less than 1 pound for males and less than 2 pounds for females
[34]. Over one year of followup, there was little transition between
adiposity categories using CDC sex- and age-specific BMI
cutpoints at the 85th (overweight) and 95th (obese) percentiles
[35]. Because only 42 respondents (6.7%) from Jefferson High and
84 (7.4%) from Sunshine High moved up one or more weight
categories, we chose to analyze one-unit changes in BMI as the
behavioral outcome. As our modeling approach required behav-
iors to be ordered categories, we recoded BMI as an integer.
Since BMI is a proxy for adiposity rather than a behavior per se,
we selected two behaviors for investigation that have been
implicated in childhood obesity: screen time and (not) playing
active sports [36]. Screen time was assessed as the sum total of
hours watching television and/or video recordings plus computer
or video games in the past week. Implausible values (i.e., above 99
hours per week; n = 4 in Jefferson High and n = 2 in Sunshine)
were re-coded as 99 hours. To aid estimation and interpretation,
screen time was divided into 10-hour categories ranging from 0
(under 10 hours of screen time) to 9 (90 or more hours per week).
Playing active sports was measured with the question: ``During the
past week, how many times did you play an active sport, such as
baseball, softball, basketball, soccer, swimming, or football?'' The
active sports score was coded as 0 (not at all), 1 (1 or 2 times), 2 (3
or 4 times), or 3 (5 or more times).
Social Network Measures
At both waves 1 and 2, all respondents were asked to name up
to 10 friends, up to 5 male and 5 female. Based on these answers,
an N by N adjacency matrix for each high school was created, where
N is the number of students in the network. If student i named
student j as a friend, then the i,j entry in the matrix was a one, and
all other entries were zero [13]. Thus, each row of the matrix
corresponds to a particular student i, called an ``ego,'' and each
ego is surrounded by his or her local ``alters'': other actors in the
network with their own attributes, network properties, and
behaviors, indexed by the subscript j, corresponding to the
columns in the adjacency matrix (these and other key terms used
throughout the paper are defined in Table 1). At baseline (Wave
1), further questions assessed the strength of each named friend;

however, this information was not used in the present analysis.
Only respondents with network (friendship) data were included in
the analysis, as only they may serve as both egos and alters.
Stochastic Actor-based Model (SABM) of Peer Selection
and Social Influence
Snijders and colleagues have developed an stochastic actor-
based model of the co-evolution of social networks and behaviors
[30,31], implemented in R as the Simulation Investigation for
Empirical Network Analysis (R-SIENA). The model uses rate
functions to assign type of change (network or behavior) for each
individual (actor). Two discrete choice functions are fitted
recursively: one for network choices (i.e., friendship selection and
dissolution), and one for changes in behavior (in our case, BMI,
screen time, or playing active sports). The outcome is a log-linked
objective function of the various actors and network attributes,
which can be likened to the utility of a particular action for each
actor. Actors are more likely to choose actions that yield larger
objective function values. But since the model is stochastic, actors
may choose lower values as well (albeit with lower probability).
The model parameters are estimated using method-of-moments
[37]. The initial network, behaviors, and attributes are used as the
starting point of the model, which is then simulated for a given set
of parameters, with the results compared to the observed data.
The parameters are then adjusted and the model is re-simulated in
an iterative cycle to minimize the difference between simulation
and observation for all actors based on target statistics for those
attributes. Standard errors are calculated using a score function
method as described in the R-SIENA manual [38].
Specification of the SABM Model
Although numerous network and behavior statistics can be
included in the model [30,31]. We included only those statistics
that theory or prior research suggested would contribute to a
critical network or behavior change. Specifically, we defined X to
be the friendship adjacency matrix described above.
For the network model, the complete objective function for
network state x for actor i given covariates y and behavior z is
defined as:
f net

where deg indexes degree (number of ties between ego i and alters
j), rec indexes reciprocity, ttip indexes transitive triplets, s is sex, g is
grade, r is black race, e is Hispanic ethnicity, a is age, c is income,
and z is the behavior variable in question (BMI, screen time per
week, or playing active sports score). The variable xij
is a dummy
variable coded 1 if ego i names alter j as a friend, and 0 otherwise;
xij
xji
is coded 1 if i and j are mutual friends (i.e., it is a reciprocated
tie). Likewise, xih
xij
xjh
is coded 1 if ego i and alter j both name
another person h as a friend, and 0 otherwise.
The linear combination of all terms results in a value for
fi
net(x,y,z), the objective function for actor i. We may convert this
value into a probability for a particular action, exponentiating it,
and then dividing by the sum of all possible exponentiated actions.
Because the network objective function is complex in its entirety,
we describe each of its components below. Each component of the
model carries a parameter estimate (b), interpreted as the weight
the actor places on a particular characteristic of his or her network
ties. We divide these into three categories: structural effects,
homophily effects, and behavior effects on the network.
Structural Effects
1. Outdegree is defined by the formula bdeg
Sj
xij
, where
Sj
xij
is the total number of named friends, and bdeg
is
the parameter (weight placed on adding, keeping, or
dropping a new alter), regardless of that alter's

Degree the total number of alters an ego has named

characteristics. Because social actors cannot sustain
an unlimited number of friendship ties, bdeg
is always
negative.
2. Reciprocity is the effect of the ego naming a friend
if the alter has named the ego as a friend, and is
defined by the formula brec
Sj
xij
xji
. Since xij
xji
only
takes the value 1 if both ego i and alter j name each
other as friends, Sj
xij
xji
is the total sum of mutual ties.
3. Transitive triplets is defined as the effect of the
ego i naming alter j's friend h (friend of a friend). The
formula is bttip
Sj,h
xih
xij
xjh
, where xih
xij
xjh
takes the value
1 if actor i names actor h, actor i names actor j, and
actor i also names actor h. Thus, the sum over j and h
is the total number of actors to whom i is tied who
are also friends with each other.
Homophily Effects for Actor Attributes
4. Same sex is the effect of the number of ties the ego
has with alters of the same sex, defined as
bs
Sj
xij
I{si
= sj
}, where I{si
= sj
} takes the value 1 if
both i and j are the same sex.
5­7. Same grade (bg
Sj
xij
I{gi
= gj
}), same black race
(br
Si
xij
I{ri
= rj
}), and same Hispanic ethnicity
(be
Si
xij
I{ei
= ej
}) are defined analogously to same sex.
Because of its racial and ethnic homogeneity, same
race and same Hispanic ethnicity are omitted from
the model for Jefferson High.
8­9. Age similarity and income similarity quantify
how much weight actors place on choosing friends of
similar age and income. They are calculated using
the sum of similarity scores between the ego and his
or her alters for age, ba,sim
Sj
xij
(sima,ij
­ sima,average
), and
for income, bc,sim
Sj
xij
(simc,ij
­ simc,average
). We defined
similarity for age (a) between ego i and alter j to be
sima,ij
= 1­ [|ai
­ aj
|/(arange
)], where arange
is the
difference between the largest and smallest value of
age in the network. The measure for each dyad is
centered by subtracting the mean similarity, sima,avg
,
from the similarity measure for that dyad. Income
similarity is calculated by substituting income for age
in this formula. Since household income was missing
for many respondents (17% in Jefferson, and 39% in
Sunshine), we substituted the mean value for the
school for these actors.
Behavior Effects on Network
10. Behavior ego is interpreted as extra activity or
sociability for egos with high values of the behavior
(BMI, screen time, or active sports). It is calculated as
xi+
zi,
the outdegree weighted by the value of the
behavior.
11. Behavior alter is interpreted as the attraction of the
ego to alters with high values of the behavior. It is
calculated as the sum of the behavioral value over all
of the ego's alters, Sj
xij
zj
. When the parameter
estimate for the behavior alter effect is negative, this
indicates a preference to establish or maintain
friendships with alters with low values of the
behavior.
12. Behavior similarity is the statistic for homophily
on behavior. It is calculated as the centered sum of
similarity scores between the actor and all of his or
her alters, Sj
xij
(simz,ij
­ simz,avg
), using the same
general formula employed for age and income
similarity. Actors are assumed to prefer alters who
are most similar to themselves with regard to
behavior (BMI, screen time, and active sports).
Behavior Objective Function
For the behavior model, the complete objective function for
network state x for actor i given covariates y and behavior z is
defined as:
fi
beh z,x
ð Þ ~ blin
(zi
{ zavg
) z bquad
zi
{ zavg
À Á
2
z bbeh
½Sjxij simz,ij simz,avg
À Á
=Sjxij

There are three parameters for the behavioral model: linear and
quadratic ``shape'' parameters and the average similarity effect.
13­14. linear shape effect (zi
-zavg
) and quadratic shape
(zi
-zavg
)2 effects are both centered by subtracting the
mean value of the behavior (zavg
). The linear shape
parameter (blin
) may be likened to the ``tracking'' of a
behavior over time. Subjects who are already higher
than average on the behavior are likely to increase it,
while subjects who are lower are less likely to do so.
The quadratic shape effect allows for non-linearity in
this association, whereby extreme values at one time
point may lead to even more extreme values at a
future time point. Snijders and colleagues argue that
a positive and significant value for the quadratic
shape parameter bquad
indicates addictive behavior
[30].
15. Behavior average similarity is defined as
Sj
xij
(simz,ij
­ simz,avg
)/Sj
xij
. The focus of our analysis
is on this effect, as it represents behavioral social
influence or assimilation. If the parameter bbeh
makes
a meaningful contribution to the behavior objective
function, then it indicates that egos whose behavior
differs from that of their peers assimilate to their
peers by increasing or decreasing the behavior. With
BMI, this may indicate a conscious decision to lose
weight in order to fit in with lean friends, or an
unconscious choice of unhealthy foods based on
imitating peer behavior.
Note that SIENA requires separate models for each investigated
behavior. To rule out unmeasured confounders at the school level,
and since schools define the boundaries of the social networks, we
stratified all analyses by school. Because there are two schools
(Jefferson and Sunshine) and three behaviors examined (BMI,
screen time, and playing active sports), a total of 6 models were
run.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
The characteristics of students in the two schools are listed in
Table 2. Respondents in each school were similar on age, percent
male, and playing active sports. Average household income was
$11,500 higher in Jefferson High than Sunshine. Both BMI

(1.7 kg/m2) and screen time (3.5 hours/week) were higher in
Sunshine High than Jefferson and Jefferson High respondents
reported more friendships (3.5 vs. 1.8 per student) resulting in a
higher overall number of ties (2201 vs. 2025), despite fewer
students. There were also a greater number of average recipro-
cated ties (mutual friendships) and transitive triplets (the friend of
an alter's friend is also the ego's friend) in Jefferson compared to
Sunshine. The similarity measures are centered by the overall
average in the network, and thus are close to zero.
Network Objective Function
Parameters for the network objective function that were
common to all models were robust to the inclusion of different
behavioral attributes; that is, network structural parameters
(degree, reciprocity, transitive triplets, and homophily on sex,
grade, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, age, and income) are not
confounded by behavioral attributes of actors, and did not change
appreciably across models. Table 3 shows network structural
characteristics:. all but one of the parameter estimates in this table
make meaningful contributions to the objective function for
adding or deleting a network tie: income similarity in Jefferson
High which was close to zero with a wide confidence interval. The
estimates may be likened to the weight that each individual places
upon network and alter attributes in deciding to add or drop a
friendship tie or to keep his or her personal network as it is. Out-
degree is strongly negative, reflecting the disinclination to form ties
with random alters. Reciprocity, however, is strongly positive,
indicating that an ego is highly inclined to form or keep friendship
ties with alters who have named the ego as a friend. The values for
sex, grade, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, age, and income
quantify the weight placed on homophily for these attributes.
Parameters for the network objective function change across
models when we examine different behaviors (Table 4). These
differences arise from each behavior having its own distribution,
and actors giving the behaviors different weights. The attractiveness
measures represent the weight egos place on alters' behavior;
positive measures indicate that egos prefer alters who are above
average on the behavior, while negative measures indicate a
preference for those below the mean on those behaviors. Positive
sociability (called ``activity'' by Snijders et al. [30]) measures indicate
that egos are more likely to form ties if they have above-average
values of the behavior. Finally, similarity measures indicate a
preference for alters who have values that are similar to the ego's
values on the behavioral attribute. In both Jefferson High and
Sunshine High, we found evidence of homophily on BMI, with a
parameter estimate of 0.54 and 95% confidence interval (0.14,
0.95) for Jefferson, and 1.30 (0.68, 1.91) for Sunshine. In both
schools, high BMI students chose friends who were similarly high
in BMI, while lean students chose lean friends. Ego's BMI also
made a small contribution to sociability; all things being equal,
students with high BMI named more friends than those who are
low on BMI. Sensitivity analyses, including additional controls for
screen time similarity and playing active sports similarity, did not
meaningfully change these results.
Jefferson High showed evidence of homophily on active sports.
Respondents who reported playing active sports more often were

1Parameters are the weights actors place on various network configurations.
They are the contributions to the objective function. The 95% confidence
intervals quantify the precision of the estimates a score function method.
2The basic rate parameter for friendship controls how often actors have the
opportunity to change their network (add, keep, or drop a friend). Higher values
indicate more network changes.
3The outdegree parameter is the weight placed on having a friendship tie with
any member of the social network, irrespective of the alter's characteristics.
4The reciprocity parameter is the weight an actor places on reciprocating alters'
friendship nominations.
5The transitive triplets parameter is the weight an actor places on naming
friends who are also named by the actor's friend.
6Positive values of ``same'' and ``similarity'' measures are the effects of
homophily on these attributes.

more likely to choose others who also played more often, perhaps
because they chose friends who played the same sports. We note
that when all forms of physical activity (active sports, exercising,
and rollerblading or bike riding) were combined to create a
summary score, neither school showed evidence of homophily
(results not shown). Playing active sports, however, did not appear
to be a basis for friendship selection in Sunshine High; this may
have been due to the lower density of that network. Against our
prediction, screen time did not appear to affect the actors' choice
of friends in either school.
To illustrate how the network objective function is calculated,
consider a respondent from Jefferson High who is male, 17 years
old, in grade 11, and with a BMI of 25 (we do not include income
similarity or attractiveness of alter's BMI here because the
parameter estimates make ignorable contributions to the objective
function). The student has 2 friends, one of whom reciprocates,
and one who does not; the alters are male, both in grade 11, and
both with a BMI of 25. The alters are not friends with each other.
The network objective function for this student's current network
is a linear combination of parameters for outdegree (23.56),
reciprocity (2.26), transitive triplets (0.48), identical sex (0.18),
same grade (0.49), age similarity (0.91), sociability (0.14), and BMI
similarity (0.54). Similarity scores are calculated as described
above, yielding the following formula:

Suppose this student is contemplating dropping his male friend
who has not reciprocated, or adding a third male friend who is
obese (i.e., has a BMI of 30), but who has named the ego as a
friend, thus creating a reciprocated friendship tie. This third male
student is also 17 and in grade 11. We may calculate the predicted
probability of dropping, adding, or keeping the same ties for any
individual in the network by exponentiating the value of the
objective function for a particular scenario, and dividing it by the
sum of the exponentiated objective values for all possible scenarios.
If our network contained only the four individuals described here,
the ego could make four possible choices: keep the same network;
drop one of the 2 existing ties; or add the tie that is not present.
The exponentiated values of these four choices, and the
probability of each, would be:
1. Keep network the same: exp(22.77) = 0.0624;
p = 0.0624/0.9584 = 0.065
2. Drop tie with reciprocating alter: exp(22.52) = 0.0807;
p = 0.084
3. Drop tie with the non-reciprocating alter:
exp(20.26) = 0.7737; p = 0.807
4. Add tie to alter with BMI of 30: exp(23.18) = 0.0415;
p = 0.043
Note that the denominator for each probability (p) is 0.9584, the
sum of the four exponentiated objective function values for each
choice (0.0624+0.0807+0.7737+0.0415). In this artificial scenario,
it is most likely the student will make the third choice, that is, to
drop the existing unreciprocated tie. This choice has the highest
probability because the parameters are obtained from a school
containing 624 individuals, but we are applying them to a
hypothetical network of only 4 individuals which is high in density
(0.25, as there are 3 ties over 463 or 12 possible ties). In reality,
the network is already low in density (density is 0.006, as only 2201
of the 6246623 possible ties are present). There are 624 network
choices possible for a student at Jefferson High, or as many choices
as there are actors in the network, and the value of the objective
function for each choice would need to be calculated and
compared to estimate the predicted probability of any particular
choice.
Behavior Objective Function
Values for the behavior objective function parameters are listed
in Table 5. We found evidence of peer influence (social modeling
or assimilation) for BMI and playing active sports in both Jefferson
and Sunshine High, and for screen time in Jefferson High.

Evidence of Peer Influence on BMI
The BMI average similarity score for Jefferson High was 14.10
(95% CI: 7.76, 20.44). This indicates a tendency for egos to try to
match the average BMI of their friends; if their BMIs are higher
than their friends, this will tend to pull their BMI down; if they are
lower than their friends, it will pull their BMI up. While this
parameter estimate seems high, it must be viewed in the context of
the mean value (0.017), minimum (20.54), maximum (0.14), and
interquartile range (20.002 to 0.078) of average similarity values.
Thus, at the 25th percentile value, the contribution of average
similarity to the objective function is (14.10)(20.002) = 20.028; at
the 75 percentile, it is (14.10)(0.078) = 1.10. The BMI average
similarity value for Sunshine High was similar, at 10.57 (95% CI:
5.30, 15.85). Sensitivity analyses, including additional controls to
the behavior objective function for sex, ethnicity, race, age,
income, body weight image, trying to lose weight, and trying to
gain weight, did not meaningfully change these parameter
estimates (results not shown).
The behavior objective function is simpler than the network
function because there are only three choices that an actor can
make: stay the same; move up one unit; or move down one unit.
The larger the value is of the objective function, the greater the
probability of the choice made, and it will depend both on the
ego's BMI and the average similarity with his or her alters. Ego's
current BMI influences future BMI, as indicated by the ``linear
shape'' and ``quadratic shape'' parameters. As current BMI values
increase, there is a greater tendency to increase BMI between time
steps; that is, more emphasis is placed upon increasing BMI than
decreasing it. Translating the behavior objective function into
probabilities is done in an analogous fashion to the calculation for
network changes. We exponentiate the value of the objective
function for a particular BMI state, and then divide it by the sum
of the exponentiated objective function values for all three
scenarios (move down one unit, stay same, or move up one unit).
To illustrate, consider a student in Jefferson High whose BMI is
23, close to the mean value (22.6). We can assume the student is
male; while sex is not a part of the behavior objective function, it is
a determinant of the student's friends. If the actor has no friends,
then only the linear and quadratic shape will drive the objective
function values of his 3 choices:
1. Drop one unit of BMI (i.e., go from 23 to 22):
exp(20.093) = 0.912; prob = 0.278
2. Stay at the same BMI (23): exp(0.0689) = 1.071;
prob = 0.327
3. Increase one unit of BMI (from 23 to 24):
exp(0.260) = 1.30; prob = 0.395
The most probable scenario is that the actor will increase his
BMI by one unit, but the other two scenarios are nearly as likely.
Now consider a situation where this same ego has 2 friends,
each with the identical BMI of 30 kg/m2. The centered average
similarity value between this ego and his friends is thus:
Simi,j
~1{ D23{30D=33
½ {0:865~{0:077
Were he to move up one unit in BMI, the centered similarity
measure would become larger (0.047); were he to move down one
unit, similarity would become smaller (20.107). These measures
then figure into the objective function, and each ``move'' in BMI
can be assigned a probability:
1. Drop one unit in BMI: exp(20.093+(14.10)(20.107))=-
exp(21.608)=0.200; p=0.163
2. Stay at the same BMI: exp(21.019) = 0.361;
p = 0.293
3. Increase one unit BMI: exp(20.402) = 0.669;
p = 0.544
It is more likely than not that this subject will increase his BMI.
The converse, however, is not true: going down in BMI when
alters are lower on BMI is much less likely than gaining body mass
when the alters are higher. If the scenario were reversed, with the
ego's BMI beginning at 30 and the alters' at 23, the probability of
decreasing BMI is 0.351, while the probability of increasing BMI is
0.319. Table 6 shows the probability of increasing, decreasing, or
remaining at the same BMI for various combinations of egos' BMI
and average similarity with alters' BMI. The table shows that egos
who have alters with higher BMI will be more likely to be pulled in
the alters' direction, while egos with leaner alters do not necessarily
have higher probabilities of moving down.

Predicted Behavior on Screen Time and Playing Active
Sports
Similar calculations can be made for peer influence in Jefferson
High on screen time (Table 7) and playing an active sport
(Table 8). Results (Table 7) show that egos with low values of
screen time are unlikely to increase their screen time if their alters
are similar in screen time. Egos who are high on screen time are
likely to remain high or increase their screen time if their alters
spend much time in front of the TV or computer. Because of the
negative linear and positive quadratic shape contributions to the
objective function, egos in the middle are more likely to be
influenced by extremes of peer behavior: egos with a screen time of
30­39 hours per week are most likely to reduce their screen time if
their alters are low on screen time (10­19 hours/week) (probability
of decrease = 0.61), whereas egos who are medium-high viewers at
60­69 hours/week are most likely to increase time if their average
alter watches 80­89 hours/week (probability of increase = 0.62).
A similar pattern is noted for playing active sports (Table 8).
Egos who played an active sport once or twice in the past week at
Wave 1 had a 75% predicted probability of decreasing their
playing sports if their average alter did not play any sports. On the
other hand, egos who played sports 3­4 times a week at baseline
had a 62% probability of increasing their playing sports if their
average alter played 5 or more times.
Discussion
Our model's primary strength is that we explicitly model both
the processes of friendship formation and social influence. Our
results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating clustering

of friends' obesity and related behaviors [7,10,25,29]. All of these
previous models employ a variation of the generalized estimating
equation (GEE), which accounts for the correlated structure of the
data, but does not explicitly model social network dynamics. While
showing that BMI and behaviors cluster is consistent with a causal
story that friends influence one another (or that obesity spreads
through social networks), GEE models offer little support of such a
causal claim. The crux of the problem lies in the potential for
confounding by shared environments and homophily [26], or the
tendency of similar individuals to form friendships as in the adage
``birds of a feather flock together'' [39]. Controls for shared
environments can be introduced using traditional methods, such as
adjusting for neighborhood characteristics or including controls for
fixed effects, as done by Cohen-Cole and Fletcher [24].
Homophily is more difficult to control for, since it may be based
not only on the behavior in question (which is observed), but also
on unobserved (latent) tendencies for friendship formation (e.g., a
shared propensity for the behavior, which may itself be due to
race, sex, or other characteristic). Unless the shared propensity
toward both the behavior and the friendship is controlled for, we
cannot progress beyond merely documenting a correlation of
behavior between friends.
We found that a number of well-known bases for homophily
operate in the Add Health friendship network, including sex, age,
grade, race-ethnicity, and income [39]. Our findings are also
consistent with two works by de la Haye [9,40] and one by
O'Malley [41] that findevidence for homophily on body size using
SABM, exponential random graph and tie prediction models.
While we found evidence that homophily matters for BMI and for
playing active sports, we found no evidence for homophily on
screen time. Because the model allows for homophily in friendship
retention and in dropping ties, results should be robust to the
``unfriending problem'' described by Noel and Nyhan [42]. After
accounting for these many sources of homophily (age, race-
ethnicity, income, sex, and grade), we found evidence of social
influence for BMI, screen time, and playing active sports. These
results contrast with de la Haye and colleagues' SABM analysis
[40], which did not find any evidence of peer influence on BMI
once homophily and other structural factors were taken into
account. These differing results may be due to their study's smaller
sample size (N = 156), the Australian setting, or a different
specification of the influence parameter (alter's BMI, rather than
similarity between ego's and alters' BMI, as in our model).
Our model further extends prior work by specifically examining
behaviors implicated in the epidemic of childhood obesity. The
model is based on observations of respondents from two large high
schools that are quite different, yet the results show substantively
similar evidence of peer influence on BMI and playing active
sports. Estimates of social influence in the two schools are not
directly comparable, because these measures depend upon such
factors as the average behavioral values and ranges for the school
and the density of network ties. For example, effects for influence
may have been smaller in Sunshine High due to the sparseness of
its in-school social network, as reflected in the lower average out-
degree (1.8, vs. 3.5 in Jefferson High). Differences in the built
environment between the two schools may also have contributed
to heterogeneity of effects [43]. Because we stratified the analyses
to respondents within two schools, the school environment cannot
be a confounder. Stratification further allowed us to demonstrate
internal validity, as qualitatively similar results for peer influence
on BMI and playing active sports were obtained in both schools.
Our model also addresses a major limitation of regression-based
approaches. As noted by Salizi and Thomas, peer influence effect
can only be identified if the mechanism for friendship formation
can be specified, measured, and included in the model [26]. Our
model does provide such specification for friendship selection,
based on reciprocity, transitivity, and homophily on several
characteristics, including the behavior in question (BMI, screen
time, and playing active sports). Our modeling framework also
captures feedback between selection and influence processes. For
example, large weight gain may be stigmatizing and lead to social
isolation [44], in which case the beneficial effect of having (leaner)
friends would be missed. Alternatively, obese adolescents might
form and maintain friendships only with other obese adolescents; if
social influence is present, then the two processes would be

reinforcing. Regression models, which assume individual observa-
tions to be independent, cannot handle this type of complexity.
There are several limitations to our study. First, we rely on self-
reported BMI, screen time, and frequency of playing active sports.
Self-reported BMI is known to suffer from cross-sectional
misclassification bias based on sex, age, and race-ethnicity
[45,46]. However, because sex and race-ethnicity are constant
across waves and age only differs by one year, change in BMI might
be underreported but should not otherwise be biased. Field and
colleagues found that while obese males and females underreport-
ed weight by the largest margin, weight change showed relatively
little bias (underreported by 1.7 pounds in males, and over-
reported by 0.3 pounds in females) [34]. Likewise, screen time may
be underreported and playing sports over-reported, but these
biases should be consistent across waves.
A second is our use of observational data. There is no feasible
mechanism for randomly assigning friendships, which would be
the most satisfying means of removing homophily as a competing
explanation, although some forms of dyadic relationship may be
assigned. In a ``natural experiment'' of the random assignment of
college freshmen roommates, researchers found that obese women
negatively influence weight gain in their roommates, perhaps
through eating behavior [47]. Nevertheless, roommates are not
necessarily friends, and the results of this study cannot be directly
compared to the current results. Another approach would involve
the random assignment of obesity status to one node of a dyad.
The only ``natural experiment'' we can identify, however, is a
study by Woodard and colleagues of weight loss following a
spouse's bariatric surgery [48]. Because of the observational nature
of our data, we lacked some measures that may have confounded
the findings of peer influence. In particular, we did not have a
measure of Tanner stage. Physical maturation is an important
contributor to individual BMI trajectories and physical activity
[49], and it is plausible that more developed adolescents were both
more likely to be friends and also more likely to increase BMI.
A further limitation is that the SABM model is designed for
discrete behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption
[30,31]. On the behavior side, the SABM requires that increases
or decreases occur in single unit quanta, and is unable to handle
continuous behavioral outcomes. In addition, SABM was designed
for small networks (up to a few hundred actors). In small networks,
each actor has the opportunity to form ties with all other actors
[30], an assumption that is unlikely to hold in our analyses.
Running analyses on such large networks was computationally
intensive: each model took several hours on an 8-core machine to
complete. Finally, SIENA can only model one behavior at a time,
precluding simultaneous modeling of peer influence on BMI,
screen time, and playing active sports. In future studies, we hope to
address some of these limitations by extending the SABM
framework to handle continuous behavior measures in large
networks with greater computational efficiency. For the present
time, however, the implementation in R-SIENA is the only means
capable of teasing apart network dynamics and social influence.
In conclusion, we found support for social influence on obesity-
related measures and behaviors that is independent of homophily
or confounding by shared school environment. Nevertheless,
homophily on BMI and playing sports cannot be ignored. We will
use these model results to parameterize an agent-based model of
peer influence and selection processes. In the absence of direct
experimentation (such as the natural experiments described
earlier), it remains unclear how social networks can be harnessed
to promote health or prevent obesity. Regardless, evidence on the
importance of social networks continues to accumulate. For
intervention purposes, networks may provide an explanation for
why ``high-risk'' approaches that focus only on obese individuals
qua individuals are prone to fail [50]. Networks may also offer
insight into what Sterman terms ``policy resistance, [which] arises
when we do not understand the full range of feedbacks
surrounding... our decisions'' ([51] p.507). Our model shows that
social influence tends to operate more in detrimental directions,
especially for BMI; a focus on weight loss is therefore less likely to
be effective than a primary prevention strategy against weight
gain. Effective interventions will be necessary to overcome these
barriers, requiring that social networks be considered rather than
ignored.
