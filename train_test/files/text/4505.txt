Introduction
Family leisure is a widely used term referring to "time that
parents and children spend together in free time or recre-
ational activities" (Shaw, 1997, p. 98). The idealization of
family leisure in various media outlets depicts quality time
and family togetherness in a positive light (Shaw, 2001). In
research, it is argued that family leisure involvement pro-
motes family functioning and "facilitates feelings of close-
ness, personal relatedness, family identity and bonding"
(Poff, Zabriskie, & Townsend, 2010, p. 367). Families yearn
for the "ideal of togetherness" (Daly, 2001, p. 288), and com-
mon activities during family time can be romanticized as
time involving "everyone having fun or strengthening bonds
of intimacy" (Segrin & Flora, 2011, p. 46). Some studies,
however, present a less romantic, more critical take on fam-
ily leisure. Shaw (2008) pointed out that the different mem-
bers in the family can have different experiences with family
leisure. While mothers may continue experiencing the
responsibility of caring for the children associated with nec-
essary household chores, fathers may structure their leisure
by adopting the children's activities (Such, 2006). Harrington
(2014) found that in Australian families, there is a classed
dimension in the parents' intentions for joint family activi-
ties. A common aim among low-income parents is to create
family bonds that last after the children have left home.
Middle-income parents stressed that family leisure can pass
on values that are important to children's later work life, such
as "working together, getting along, being responsible"
(Harrington, 2014, p. 480).
"The Core and Balance Model of Family Leisure
Functioning" (Zabriskie & McCormick, 2001) describes
"core" and "balance" as two functions of family leisure activi-
ties. Core family leisure addresses needs for stability and
cohesion between family members. It typically involves activ-
ities such as watching television together, playing board
games, playing in the yard, or other home-based activities.
Balance family leisure addresses the families'need for change
and the opportunity to learn new skills through novel experi-
ences. It typically involves the families physically getting
away from everyday hustle to unusual, less frequent, non­
home-based activities (Zabriskie & McCormick, 2001), such
as trips to a theme park or outdoor recreation. Theoretically,
this model suggests that to promote family functioning, there
should be a relatively equal involvement in family leisure at
home and away (Zabriskie, 2001). It also suggests that
although most activities can be characterized as either balance
or core, some activities may provide stability for one family

Hiking Leisure: Generating a Different
Existence Within Everyday Life
Rob Bongaardt1, Idun Røseth2, and Børge Baklien3
Abstract
This study explores how hiking trips in the forest afford two Norwegian families experiences of leisure during the trips. In situ
interviews were analyzed using a descriptive phenomenological research method, which brackets theoretical or ideological
assumptions during data collection and analysis. The results show that three levels of experience are interwoven. First,
individual family members, parents as well as children, are immersed in the activities in their physical environment, which
evokes positive bodily feelings. Second, interactions and dialogue between family members concerning actual events during
the trip give rise to a sense of belonging and togetherness. Finally, the family creates a narrative about itself in the light of
its own future as well as sociocultural expectations. We characterize this tapestry of experiences as an act of hiking leisure.
We conclude that the experience of the hiking trip goes beyond a simple duality of a core versus balance activity theory and
answers the call for research that incorporates the natural contexts in which leisure activities take place.

but change and novelty for another (Zabriskie & McCormick,
2001). In a recent article, Izenstark and Ebata (2016) called for
research that goes beyond a sheer theoretical approach and
incorporates context, such as the natural environment, includ-
ing trees, grass, events, animals, and so on. In this article, we
address how two Norwegian families make sense of their
experiences with hiking in the forest. How does the experi-
enced meaning of their hiking trip relate to the functions of
leisure delineated by the core and balance model and how does
the natural environment provide context for these functions?
To answer these questions, we build on the concept of
"leisure affordance" (Pierskalla & Lee, 1998, p. 75), which
bridges the gap between the physical and the experiential
worlds that families engage in when hiking in the forest. In
the next section, we will present the affordance concept,
incorporating recent theoretical developments. A phenome-
nological study of two families hiking in the forest forms the
core of this article. We explain how we designed and con-
ducted this research, linking the theoretical framework of
affordances to Husserlian descriptive phenomenological
research. In the discussion, we underscore the relation
between the general meaning structure of the phenomenon at
hand--a family hiking in the forest--and the various affor-
dances that are effectuated in this activity. We suggest that
these two Norwegian families seek experiences of the famil-
iar as well as novelty in their hiking trips, demonstrating a
blend of core and balance activities.
The Concept of Leisure Affordance
Pierskalla and Lee (1998) proposed a holistic model of recre-
ation that takes into account the experience of meaning for
the person as well as the properties of the environment that
are significant to the realization of this meaning. They
resorted to ecological perception theory, as initiated by
Gibson (1986) and further developed by the Gibsonians
(Michaels & Carello, 1981; Reed, 1996; Turvey, 1992), as
the basis for their model. Affordance is the core concept of
the ecological approach to perception and action; an affor-
dance is defined as a property of the environment that affords
action that is meaningful for the organism. In recreational
science, as Pierskalla and Lee (1998) argued, one can speak
of leisure affordances, that is, information in the environ-
ment that affords leisure activities for human beings:
Examples of forest affordances include locomotion (e.g., trails),
manipulation (e.g., forest products), concealment (e.g., city
buffers), and certain behaviour (e.g., roads vs. hiking trails).
These affordances can also be described by the perceiver using
mental concepts such as excitement, relaxation, or stress. (p. 71)
Another ecological psychological concept endorsed by
Pierskalla and Lee (1998) is that of event. An event takes
place with a spatial and temporal configuration and captures
the whole of the affordance and activities that take place
within it. A hiking trip, for instance, begins and ends with
respect to both time and place; it is an event in itself, includ-
ing a pattern of activities that effectuates affordances that are
available and meaningful. Events are seen as nested struc-
tures, and Pierskalla and Lee (1998) stated that "[f]uture
research might suggest that a short hiking event in a park be
nested in a longer vacation event" (p. 72). We will return to
the idea of nesting in the discussion.
The concept of leisure affordance was picked up by
Kleiber, Walker, and Mannell (2011) in the second edition of
A Social Psychology of Leisure. They further specified the
concept of leisure affordance in outdoor environments to
include preferred experience, that is, qualities such as "par-
ticularly enjoyment, relaxation, and a feeling of comfortable
present-centeredness" (Kleiber et al., 2011, p. 425). In addi-
tion, they underscored the role of social affordances. In this
field of research, it is important to understand the properties
of an environment that afford social interaction or are "con-
ducive to self-expression more generally" (Kleiber et al.,
2011, p. 426).
Three troublesome themes run through these adaptations
of the ecological approach to leisure science, namely, the
question of how affordances for physical activity relate to
affordances of a psychological and social nature, the issue of
the existence of affordance for the individual as experienced
as meaningful yet existing independently of the individual in
the environment, and a lack of empirical research applying
and developing the leisure affordance concept. Points of
debate around the affordance concept in general have existed
since its introduction in the 1960s (see Michaels, 2003, for a
review of these). A recent article by Rietveld and Kiverstein
(2014) developed a conceptual framework that claims to
overcome some of the sticky problems, and, as we stress for
the purpose of this article, offers a way to frame the leisure
affordance concept that opens up for its use in empirical
research. The crux of their approach is to emphasize that
affordances are embedded in sociocultural practices (Rietveld
& Kiverstein, 2014). The varieties of practices that humans
engage in are patterned as different "forms of life," "manifest
in the normative behaviours and customs of our communi-
ties" (pp. 328-329).
The flexibility that the notion of a "form of life" offers allows us
to capture the variety of practices within the human way of life.
It can be understood on at least three grains of analysis: the
human form of life in general (as contrasted with the form of life
of another kind of animal); a particular sociocultural practice . . .;
and finally, the particular engagement with affordances of
individuals that we see when we zoom in on this practice at a
more detailed level of analysis. It is this straddling of different
grains of analysis that makes the notion of "form of life" well
suited for using it in a definition of affordances. (Rietveld &
Kiverstein, 2014, p. 330)
For the individual, the perception and effectuation of affor-
dances requires a certain skill. Children and adult novices
Bongaardt et al. 3
alike require "the improvement of perceiving with practice
and the education of attention" (Gibson, 1986, p. 254).
Educators provide normative assessment of the learner's per-
ception based on the execution of a particular skill in an
actual situation: "situated normativity," as Rietveld and
Kiverstein (2014, p. 332, emphasis in original) coined this.
The properties of the particular physical environment also
require the education of attention: Steep Amsterdam stairs or
rain on an icy mountain road provides instant "judgment" of
the skill of the one who dares to take on the climb. The par-
ticular skills of an individual, in other words, require a famil-
iarity with the socio-material surrounds in agreement with a
particular form of life, which provides normative standards
(Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). In terms of the present article,
all this translates into saying that hiking in the forest as a
leisure activity takes place in a landscape of leisure affor-
dances, whereby the latter can be understood as nested socio-
material properties of the surrounds that afford positive
feelings of well-being.
We now turn our attention to the concrete use of the idea
of leisure affordances in a field study, that is, a gateway to
understanding what sense families make of their hiking trip
and how this translates into the constructs of core and bal-
ance family leisure activities. As we will describe in the next
section in more detail, we accompanied and interviewed two
families on day-long hiking trips through a forest. For the
interviews and the analysis, we used a descriptive phenome-
nological research approach. It has been argued that the
Gibsonian approach is congruent with phenomenology.
These approaches understand perception, movement, and the
body in similar ways, which is best illustrated with reference
to Merleau-Ponty (Merleau-Ponty & Smith, 2002). Dohn
(2009), for example, stated that
[r]eturning to the concept of affordances with the Merleau-
Pontian notion of body schema, the two concepts emerge as
complementary ways of referring to the fact that concrete
situations are, objectively seen, meaningfully structured relative
to the actual skills of a particular agent. (p. 161, emphasis in
original)
Phenomenological psychologists who followed Merleau-
Ponty and Husserl (a founding father of phenomenology)
have developed research methods that tease out meanings as
these are experienced by a person in a concrete situation. We
contend that the phenomenological research method we have
used in our study of a family's hiking trip is consistent with
and, in fact, a concrete operationalization of a Gibson-
inspired study of leisure affordances.
Method
Descriptive phenomenology aims to uncover the meaning
structure of a phenomenon as it appears to the consciousness
of those who experience it. As consciousness is primarily
concerned with something else than itself, this meaning
structure describes the meaningful relationships that the per-
son has with others and the world as well as his or her own
place within this. This meaning is as experienced by the per-
son and is not merely a statement about the external world. It
is said that phenomenologists refrain from claiming existen-
tial truth and rather focus on how the phenomenon and its
meaning appear to the person as manifest through his or her
interaction with them. In this particular study, we used
Giorgi's (2009) descriptive phenomenological method.
Giorgi based his research method on Husserl's phenomeno-
logical philosophy, but he changed it to enable it to be used
in research on other persons than oneself, as is common in
qualitative social and human scientific research.
Data are typically obtained from people's everyday life
world, which is the "common everyday world into which we
are all born and live" (Giorgi, 2009, p. 10). When collecting
and analyzing the data, the researcher is to suspend or
"bracket" theoretical assumptions about the phenomenon
under study. The researcher also makes an effort to minimize
his or her own preconceptions about the phenomenon and
adopts an attitude of wonder (Merleau-Ponty & Smith,
2002). After the analysis and presentation of data are com-
pleted, the researcher can remove the brackets and open up
the newly acquired description of the phenomenon for fur-
ther dialogue with existing research or other rich sources of
information about the phenomenon at hand, or, for example,
with professional practice.
Participants
The data for this particular study were selected from a previ-
ous set of data collected in Norway in 2012 to explore phe-
nomenologically the relationship between hiking in nature
and experienced sense of well-being (Baklien, Ytterhus, &
Bongaardt, 2015). Two of the interviews in that study took
place over the course of a day, in contrast to the other inter-
views that took no more than about half an hour. The present
article is based on those two day-long trips. We recruited the
two families through their blogs on the Internet where they
had posted pictures and text about being a family who enjoy
hiking in nature. Both families consisted of a Norwegian
mother and father (all in their 30s) and two children (5 and
11, and 8 and 10 years old, respectively). These are typical
nuclear families and may represent the ideal of family leisure
experiences. In Norway, as in other parts of Western Europe
and North America, other family constellations are common
(Shaw, 2010). This was also the case in our original data set
as referred to above. We joined these two families on whole
day trips because they both had a reflective attitude toward
hiking experiences (as witnessed by their engagement on
their Internet site) and were willing to include us in their in
situ hiking experience. The third author went along with the
families on a trip into the woods and conducted the inter-
views on the way and during a gathering around a campfire.

The trips were focused on activities such as fishing or pre-
paring food rather than walking a long distance. During the
activities, individual and family meanings were generated
and confirmed as we will describe in depth. Following fami-
lies with different constellations on a day-long trip would
perhaps have revealed different meanings. The impression
from our earlier study (Baklien et al., 2015), however, is that
experienced meanings in this natural context of hiking in the
forest converge into similar themes.
Fieldwork
The focus was on the family as a unit and the entire inter-
views took place with both parents and both children present.
This type of fieldwork has been called "go-along" (Carpiano,
2009; Kusenbach, 2003). Following informants in their daily
activities, one gets an opportunity to see the phenomenon
unfold in its natural setting (Czarniawska, 2007; Ingold &
Vergunst, 2008; Kusenbach, 2003). For example, one can go
along with informants in the neighborhood, to the shop, to a
park, or out in the woods and, at the same time, ask questions
and observe how they experience, interpret, and practice
such environments (Carpiano, 2009). This method is suitable
when the researcher desires to be present in the informant's
"natural" environment to ask questions, listen and observe,
and explore life worlds and social practices where the phe-
nomenon takes place (Kusenbach, 2003). While the theoreti-
cal framework that we described above helped us to frame
the research situation and maintain sensitivity to experienced
meanings during the fieldwork, the theory of leisure affor-
dance did not inform the content of meanings that we teased
out during the analysis. That is to say, with respect to the
meaning content as experienced by the participants, we
bracketed our preconception of leisure affordances.
Data Collection
The researcher met the families in their respective homes.
Both families took the researcher to a bonfire site where the
family made a small shelter known as gapahuk. To meet the
families before the trip, to learn their names, and to walk
along with them to the bonfire site gave the researcher a
chance to chat before the interviews and to get an impression
of how the family interacted as a unit during the hiking trip.
It also gave the researcher an opportunity to create a some-
what informal relationship to avoid the feeling that he was
some kind of "inspector" judging the family's interactions
and hiking skills. Some tension was present, however, espe-
cially in relation to being a professional researcher, a partici-
pant, or being a "good guest" (Yee & Andrews, 2006, p. 407).
For example, when the family shared food and coffee with
the researcher, he was a guest; when participating in carrying
gear or collecting dry wood for the fire, he was a participant;
and when asking questions, he was a researcher. The inter-
views were recorded when sitting around the fire. Both
families were eager to share their experience. Most of the
descriptions came from the parents; the children occasion-
ally joined the conversation, but took part in most of the
ongoing activity. The taped interviews lasted approximately
2 hr each.
Data Analysis
In our study, two families totaling eight persons participated.
The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and ana-
lyzed using Giorgi's (2009) phenomenological method. The
interviews were conducted in Norwegian. In his research
method, Giorgi recommends four steps to analyze data. The
first step is to read the entire transcript to get a sense of the
whole. In Step 2, the transcript is read again, and meaning
units are identified. That is to say, when rereading the inter-
views, the researcher makes a mark in the text when he or she
experiences a shift in the meaning. This typically occurs
when the participant moves on to another aspect of his or her
life world. The 4 hr of interview data showed a typical repeti-
tion of meanings. In Step 3, the meaning units are trans-
formed into a cohesive language in an effort to identify the
general character of the meaning unit. This is a process of
so-called imaginative variation, in which the researcher tries
out different formulations of what is said at various levels of
generalization. The formulation that captures the meaning of
the experience across participants is taken into the final step
of analysis. All authors were involved in this third step as
well as the fourth step. In the fourth step, the transformed
meaning units are synthesized to a consistent statement that
expresses the general meaning structure of the entire experi-
ence of the phenomenon. The structure must be found in all
the interviews to be part of the essence of the experience of
the phenomenon. However, in the interpretation of the results
of the study, one should be aware that the general meaning
structure can never grasp the totality of the original experi-
ence (Giorgi, 2009). The researcher has to read "between the
lines" and tease out "the coherence between explicit and
implicit meanings in the description" (Røseth, 2013, p. 29).
That is to say, due to the process of imaginative variation,
these meanings appear in the meaning structure in different
phrasings than those used by the participants. The fourth step
was the opportune moment in the analytical process to make
the shift from Norwegian to English. The meaning structure
was written in English from its first draft onward, whereas
Steps 1 to 3 were conducted in Norwegian.
Giorgi's (2009) research method usually involves at least
three separate interviews with different persons who share
their views and experiences of the phenomenon under study.
The reason for this is that having only one or two participants
puts a heavy strain on the imaginative variation; it becomes
more difficult to separate the essential from the more inciden-
tal meanings. Since our study included two families with a
total of eight participants, we judge our data to be sufficiently
rich and varied to grasp meanings that are more general.

Results
The phenomenological analysis revealed a general meaning
structure of the families' experience of hiking in the forest.
The results are presented as follows: first, the general mean-
ing structure that describes the families'experience of hiking
in the forest. Second, three interrelated constituent parts of
the meaning structure are described. These constituents are
interdependent and should not be confused with theoretical
themes. However, it is common in Giorgi's descriptive phe-
nomenology to take the essential meaning structure apart and
explore its constituents independently of each other for the
sake of further analysis and discussion (Von Essen &
Englander, 2013). The constituents are presented with refer-
ence to quotes from the participants. These were translated
into English by a professional translator.
The General Meaning Structure of Hiking Family
Leisure
The family's experience is that the upcoming hiking trip to
the forest is a continuation and confirmation of their desire as
a family to integrate outdoor experiences into the way they
live their life. In a sense, this trip had started already when
they came home from the previous trip and were pondering
about where to go next time, thus prolonging the good feel-
ings that the recent trip had generated. Before the onset of the
new trip, they planned when, where, and with whom to go
hiking. Although they look forward to the joy that comes
with the trip, getting out of the door still implies the mental
challenge of leaving behind many things left undone. This is
a tension they are aware of and know will dissolve once they
are on their way. They pack for the hiking trip in anticipation
of encountering a world with physical demands more chal-
lenging than those at home. At the same time, they prepare
for a simple form of life in choosing to leave behind elec-
tronic devices or other luxury goods. Having experienced the
simplicity of outdoor life themselves earlier in life, the par-
ents are eager to pass on to their children the manual skills
and peaceful frame of mind that come with the trip. While on
the trip, the family gradually loses their interest in clock time
as they become driven by the length of day given to them by
the light of the sun and a campfire. They tune in to the pace
of the environment, through which also the pace of the fam-
ily members becomes more synchronized than it usually is at
home. Basic tasks, like fishing, collecting firewood, and pre-
paring and eating a meal around the campfire bring the fam-
ily together. Individually, a bodily feeling of well-being
emerges in congruence with the satisfactory and successful
bodily efforts that were made earlier that day--like walking
a long distance or climbing a steep slope. Good feelings also
come with sitting close together and feeling the warmth of
the flames or tasting self-prepared food. An awareness of
each person's well-being as well as being in tune as a family
underscores for them the relevance of being outdoors as part
of their life. They reinforce family unity during hiking trips
by remembering and telling stories about earlier trips. These
verbal exchanges and reflections converge into a larger nar-
rative that conveys a shared meaningful world that surpasses
the family's everyday life as lived at home, while still being
integrated into their family life.
We identified the following three constituents integrated in
the general meaning structure: (a) simplicity and bodily
awareness, (b) joint activity and cohesion in the family, and
(c) creating a larger family narrative. Between them, the three
constituents underscore that the family is aware of the rele-
vance that they attach to hiking and of their purposeful initia-
tive and endeavor to implement the hiking trips. We propose
to characterize this awareness-driven endeavor as an act of
hiking leisure. Before we discuss the meaning structure, con-
stituents, and the idea of hiking leisure in terms of the leisure
affordance concept, we will describe the three constituents in
more detail with reference to quotes from the interviews.
Constituent 1: Simplicity and Bodily Awareness
The first constituent identifies the individual family mem-
ber's interaction with the environment and the positive
bodily feelings this evokes. Immersed in the peacefulness of
the environment, a sense of simplicity takes over. The mother
in Family 2 explains that you "don't miss the paper and news
on TV and stuff like that. Because it means so little when
you're out on a hike." The father adds that when "you're out
hiking, there aren't any problems . . . whatever you've for-
gotten, well, you've kind of forgotten it . . . if you forgot to
bring a fork, it's too bad. So you have to find another solu-
tion. Make a fork from a piece of wood or something." The
father in Family 1 finds the simple lifestyle in his blackened
coffee pot. He says, ". . . it is something about the simplicity.
The eternal, somehow. . . . It has great value. Also something
to do with the campfire, of course."
The campfire is another token of life taking a turn toward
less complexity, "they belong together, campfire and a hik-
ing trip" (Mother in Family 2). This family tells us that they
always make a campfire when that is allowed, and some-
times even during summer, when it is forbidden. The father
explains that there "is something about the sound. . . . It turns
off other thoughts . . . getting cleansed a bit." And "there's
also something about sitting and staring at the flames; you
get a nice warm feeling inside," the mother adds.
However, it is not only the campfire which constitutes
bodily awareness, but also the horizon or the soothing move-
ment of water or trees affords a sense of well-being, accord-
ing to the mother in Family 1: "There's something that
moves, something that's living. But then, there's nothing that
demands anything." The family members, each in their own
way, dwell in the peaceful physical environment, which is
experienced as a distance from obligations and gives a sense
of bodily relief and well-being. The father in Family 1 sum-
marizes this as follows:
6 SAGE Open
I certainly do lower my shoulders a lot when I get outdoors. At
least now in a busy period, I'm almost a bit kind of absent when
I'm at home. My mind is somewhere else all the time, very
often, with things to be done or that should have been done.
Now [in the countryside], for example, it's quite different. Now
I'm completely focused in comparison. What you're doing,
where you are.
The first constituent underscores the experiential intertwin-
ing of a world perceived as immediately present through its
beauty and simpler qualities and the person's bodily and
mental well-being expressed as warmth and relief.
Constituent 2: Joint Activity and Cohesion in the
Family
The simplicity of the environment invites the family mem-
bers to see each other in a different light. The forest is with-
out outsiders or intrusive tasks. It affords another way of
living, a different form of social interaction, and a sense of
"just being a family" sharing activities. A son (Family 1)
states that "fortunately there's no internet in the woods, so
Dad cannot work." His father confirms that he is aware of
being more present while hiking and that this enables him to
be more open to be together with his children: "it's easier to
get me to join in their playing or something when we're out
[hiking] than when we're sitting in the living room." The
couple in the other family had this exchange:
Mother: I think that for me and [my husband], it's done a
lot for our relationship that we're so much out on hik-
ing trips. Now we're out hiking. Here we collaborate,
something like that. I don't like to stand idle with my
hands in my pockets until the tent is up, I need some-
thing to do. So we have clear tasks, who does what.
Father: From the moment we find a site for the camp until
we're lying in our sleeping bags we don't need a sys-
tem . . . somehow we both know what the other one
does.
Mother: And it feels very nice that that's the way it is.
We witnessed some of the interactions between family
members. The younger son in Family 2, for example, is
helping to build the campfire, when the mother asks the
other son: "Can you help him? There are a few longer sticks
back there. Find a small branch or a stick that has fallen
down there. Oops!" [The boy trips and falls] "Up again."
The father in this family reflects on his experience that they
are more together and that he really sees his children when
they are out hiking:
It binds us more together when we're here in the forest. . . .
Anyway, I feel that when we get out, I'm more able to see the
kids properly. . . . It's like . . . hiking . . . is good, both for the
body and for cohesion in the family.
Without distractions and time constraints, the family
members become more visible to each other. They literally
emerge in a different light. "Now I feel it's getting really
cosy, now that it's getting darker all around us. Can you see
that the campfire's shining on [the son's] face, for example?
Can you see that," the father (Family 2) asks the son, "that
it's shining on [the sister]? That's nice and cosy." The daugh-
ter in the other family notices that her father relaxes more
when hiking; "at home he is sometimes a little bit more
strict," she says.
Sitting around the campfire, sensing the presence of others
and the security they provide, the family members experience
a gathering point where they are just together. It gives them a
sense of being away from others. When they stare into the
campfire or fish or eat together, the focus is on what is happen-
ing in the situation. The parents experience that time slows
down when they become aware that time is no longer filled
with obligations but with whatever they feel like doing. They
describe their ways of being active together in the moment.
The family feels that they can just "be" without doing much.
Mother (Family 2): Although we do things and this and
that, there's no stress involved. If we're outdoors,
there's nothing we've got to do by a certain time,
maybe we'll have to be back home for something, but
apart from that, there's no constant time pressure.
Having to go here, go there, do this, do that. Here we
can just be, we don't necessarily do.
Constituent 3: Creating a Larger Family Narrative
Simple living replaces comfortable living at home. The fam-
ily sits on the ground or on some timber and they make sim-
ple food like hot dogs with simple means. They actively seek
a simpler life because that is part of what they experience as
a breathing space. In the breathing space, the family can just
stop, see each other through a joint dialogue, and create nar-
ratives about themselves. The simplicity is valued and is part
of the breathing space that becomes a plot or an event they
can attach to their shared family narrative. They retell stories
from the distant or recent past to bring forth the sense of
being together that provides continuity and belonging.
Mother (Family 2): But when we were there at Easter
then, when [the younger son] had his birthday on Palm
Sunday. Then we'd made it out of a kind of tarpaulin.
We'd made it out of wood and so on, that we'd made
like a "gapahuk," then we were lying there, each in our
own sleeping bag, and you look up at the sky and there
are thousands of stars. It's really an incredible feeling.
. . . You get a bit of perspective when you're lying
there, looking up to see thousands of stars, and if you
look some more, you see even more stars. You get a bit
humble or how should I put it.
Bongaardt et al. 7
By telling stories about earlier trips, the family creates a nar-
rative, which also incorporates reflections about why it is
important for them to be a family that takes hiking trips--
they hike the experience. The young daughter in Family 1
asks, "Mom, wasn't it fun when we were hiking there where
we were with [friend's name] and there were sheep down
there? During the evening the sheep came and stood where
we were packing."
Son: They were goats.
Father: That was another trip.
Daughter: Yes, and then the sheep came and daddy had to
chase them away, and they followed him, and he had to
hide behind a tree.
The mother in this family tells us that "the trip is definitely
good in itself, but there's something about knowing, `Well,
now I've been out hiking, now we've been together and
we've had fresh air and exercise.'" Her reflections on the
relevance of being on family trips then extend to a larger
time scale:
There's no doubt about it, I take out the kids because I think
they'll come to appreciate it, or appreciate it and remember later
. . . Creating memories, and that has to do with how you yourself
remember how it was when you went on a trip.
Even difficult and straining experiences tend to be woven
into a narrative that binds the family in a positive manner. As
the son in Family 1 recalls, "We were there, and it was actu-
ally a bit dirty, but then it was fun to slide down the hill."
Through every hiking trip the family takes, the family's nar-
rative about hiking is enacted and reshaped.
Discussion
In the theoretical section above, we have characterized the
hiking trips of the two families as events with a beginning
and an end in time and space. As events, these trips are part
of a sociocultural practice within a form of life that endeav-
ors to find a place between workaday life and leisure. Family
leisure activities are said to enhance family cohesion,
increase family satisfaction, encourage positive interaction
between family members, and bring novel experience and
adaptive strength into the family. Such scientific concepts
and theories are abstractions that need to be anchored in an
analysis of actual experiences (Pratt, Howarth, & Brady,
2000). In what follows, we discuss how a Gibsonian theory
of leisure affordance dovetails with our in-depth descriptive
phenomenological analysis of two families on a hiking trip.
The meaning structure interweaves three levels of affor-
dances of the hiking trip: First, individual family members
experience meaning on a bodily emotional level when they
effectuate physical affordances present on the trail and in the
forest. Second, interactions between family members during
the trip's events effectuate social affordances of closeness
and coherence between the family members. Finally, reflec-
tions on the phenomenon of hiking itself as induced by actual
events and joint activity as well as the interviewer's ques-
tions effectuate cultural affordances. Between them, these
activities constitute the act of hiking leisure.
The individual family members engage in activities that
the forest affords. Good examples are how a fork is cut out of
a stick lying around in the forest, how a campfire is built
from what is available in the immediate surrounds, but also
the enjoyment of the view of a sunset afforded by the water-
side and the mirroring effect of the water surface. Through
effectuating these leisure affordances, the person experi-
ences a sense of satisfaction and well-being. This takes place
at the individual level and seems to imply a limited amount
of explicit reflection during the activity--one is immersed in
the act of doing what one is doing. The perspective taken is
from the first person; the "I" forms the apex of the experi-
ence. Moreover, it is "I" who effectuates affordances that
offer a counterweight to daily life, balancing out stress and
routines. Zabriskie and McCormick (2001) referred to this as
balance leisure activities.
Yet, these activities make even more sense to the indi-
vidual person when they are shared with others. Building the
campfire is done together with other family members, the
view of the sunset is pointed out to the other, implying an
invitation between children and parents alike to share the
perspective. As such, the environment not only consists of
the natural surroundings but also of the rest of the family, so
that the nature and other family members afford a wider
range of activities. Among these activities are the conversa-
tions within the family about the same view (like the starry
sky), tasks (like putting up the tent), and artifacts (like the
father's blackened coffee kettle). This shared effectuation of
social leisure affordances constitutes the feeling of belong-
ing and togetherness for the family during the trip. In the
moment when this happens, it arises between family mem-
bers without any explicit reflection on this happening itself.
The perspective taken is from the second person, that is,
between you and me, and the "we" forms the apex of the
experience. Between you and me, we effectuate affordances
that bring us closer together and confirm the core of our exis-
tence as a family.
A third perspective is also present, one that reveals a
reflective stance on the family hiking experience, putting it
in a larger sociocultural context. Especially the parents in the
families are aware of the continuity of their hiking trips. The
family communicates what is significant and meaningful for
them through a narrative that is built out of a collection of
memorable events, situations, and feelings generated during
their trips. This narrative affords and shapes the families'
conduct because they enact what is inspiring in their life and
"what gives life meaning" (Gorro & Mattingly, 2000, p. 11).
When the family sings about what they are doing, enjoys the
starry night, fishes together, or makes a campfire, they do
8 SAGE Open
more than just add words to a narrative; they put their bodily
awareness and sense of belonging together into their narra-
tive while being in action. The narrative structure that the
family collectively constitutes thus cannot be separated from
their experience of it. Narratives help inform and form
thoughts, emotions, and perceptions, and vice versa; what is
experienced in the present affects how we understand the
past and anticipate the future (Goldie, 2000; Heidegger,
1929/1996). The narrative has a motive that lies in the future
(Van den Berg, 1972). This concerns the future of not only
the family as a whole, but also, more specifically, the chil-
dren who are given experiences that they can continue in
their own family later. One father confirmed this when he
told us that he was giving his children an experience that
children from other cultures may not get. The cultural affor-
dances illustrate most explicitly the normativity implied in
affordances (see above, Crossley, 1996; Rietveld, 2012). The
perspective taken on the family is embedded in the norma-
tive cultural expectation of Norwegian society to use nature
optimally as an easily accessible means to promote health
and family well-being (Riese & Vorkinn, 2002). The apex of
this perspective lies beyond the individual family and closer
to the family "form of life" (see above) that Norwegian soci-
ety endorses.
At this sociocultural level of understanding, hiking trips
are primarily regarded as a balancing leisure activity that
functions to promote health and well-being as a counter-
weight to daily life. Yet, at this level, one can also make a
case for understanding the family hiking trips as a core activ-
ity. The argument then goes as follows: Maclaren (2011),
who primarily follows Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological
understanding of emotions, differentiates between emotional
clichés and authentic passions. She writes,
Sometimes life presents us with a genuine question--a question
for which we do not have an answer prepared, a question that
unsettles and deranges not only the habitual network of meanings
that structures our world, but our very sense of self, of who we
are and how to live. (Maclaren, 2011, pp. 59-60)
In such situations, one may experience a genuine passion,
where emotion takes over and one struggles initially to find a
place for it. A sense of passivity characterizes the entire expe-
rience, but once one manages to resolve the situation and has
broken down habitual ways of living, a new understanding of
self and life may arise; novelty has emerged. In this sense,
hiking leisure qua balancing out a stressful life is not the cre-
ation of novelty, but rather what Maclaren describes as living
through an emotional cliché. Cliché is used as a descriptive
term rather than a normative judgment of the person or the
emotion. It describes the feelings or emotions that accompany
the realization of a meaning that one is already familiar with
"established routes for making sense of things . . . that reinsti-
tute familiar ways of being" (Maclaren, 2011, p. 58).
Emotional clichés work for us, Maclaren (2011) explained, in
helping us navigate the physical, social, and cultural world;
we assent to "a particular inclination of meaning in [the] per-
ceived world" (p. 59). In terms of the present article, the fam-
ily realizes affordances with which they are familiar within
their form of life and which they expect to bring a sense of
belonging and coherence. As hiking trips are fully integrated
in the form of life, they can be seen to generate a different
existence within everyday life each time they take place.
Conclusion
In this article, we have attempted to elaborate on and nuance
the understanding of core and balance leisure activities by
introducing a conceptual framework and a research setting
and methodology that underscore the relational character of
perception, action, and experience. Our research has high-
lighted some of the concrete meanings of these activities as
perceived by the family members themselves rather than as
conceived by theoretical constructs. In doing so, we were
able to identify various nested layers of family leisure expe-
riences. "Hiking leisure" becomes a meaningful idea because
the experience of "hiking" "hikes" different meanings as part
of the leisure activity; some counterbalance everyday life,
some strengthen a sense of family belonging, while others
prepare the family for its future. We recognize that within the
same trip, both core and balance activities are played out at
different levels of abstraction, each associated with different
types of leisure affordances. In the light of Zabriskie and
McCormick's (2001) model, this illustrates a case in which
one and the same activity fulfills both core and balance func-
tions. This aligns with Schänzel and Carr's (2016) critical
evaluation of the core and balance model. They argue that for
many present-day family constellations, this duality does not
hold, or, as is the case in our study, is applicable to some, not
all, aspects of the leisure activity.
The phenomenological approach used in this article is
often used in the fields of psychology and health care studies
where interviews are conducted in an office. The use of a
phenomenological in situ approach in the field of leisure
studies is not common. One exception is Bischoff's (2012)
phenomenological-hermeneutical study of hiking trails and
how different persons construct a variety of meanings while
hiking on the same trail based on their individual interpreta-
tions of its natural surrounds and ideological contexts (as
indicated by, for instance, the signs that mark the trail).
Earlier we referred to the "going along" methodology. What
makes our phenomenological approach different from these
studies is that one brackets, whenever possible, theoretical
assumptions or common sense assumptions while collecting
and analyzing the data. This implies that one also aims to
bracket the normative or ideological ideals or critical views
in the field in which the research is set. That is, "hiking lei-
sure" was allowed to speak for itself through the mothers,
fathers, and children who engaged in it.
Bongaardt et al. 9
The fieldwork proved manageable, but challenges remain:
Although we opted to tape the interviews and conversations
during the hours around the fire for practical reasons, other
unrecorded moments during hiking trips may involve conver-
sations that are valuable to analyze at the level of detail that
Giorgi's method provides. For example, transitional moments
from walking on a trail to setting up camp or from being
engaged in here-and-now actions to talking about experiences
from earlier trips may provide valuable information about the
shifts between and integration of levels of experiences.
Paying attention to such moments in future research may also
provide more information about the specific affordances
effectuated in hiking and other leisure situations.
