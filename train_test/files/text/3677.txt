Introduction
This article addresses the role of knowledge workers' virtues
within the knowledge society according to the late Peter
Drucker's management theory as synthesized by Maciariello
(2009). Given that Drucker's ideas are deeply rooted in, and
influenced by, an Aristotelian perspective, the notion of
knowledge workers'virtues can be explored from within this
perspective. This view espouses both intellectual virtues
(geared toward developing innovative and creative compe-
tencies) and moral character (geared toward acquiring moral
competencies).Although much has been written on the latter,
the idea and role of intellectual virtues (see Table 1) have not
been fully developed in the literature, and they are particu-
larly important as such virtues are the source of critical and
creative thinking.
We single out the intellectual virtues and moral character
that knowledge workers need to make lasting contributions
to a functioning knowledge society. We identify prudence,
effectiveness, excellence, integrity, and truthfulness as
knowledge workers' intellectual virtues, and practical wis-
dom, responsibility, cooperation, and courage as moral
character.
According to Peter Drucker (1994), "[n]o century in
recorded history has experienced so many social transforma-
tions and such radical ones as the twentieth century" (p. 53).
Unfortunately, such social transformations have recently
been accompanied by waves of corruption. With respect to
such trends, Fukuyama (1999) has coined the term Great
Disruption to describe deteriorating social conditions and
changes in social values throughout most of the industrial-
ized world as a result of the transition from an industrial to an
information era. Equally, we should point out that certain
shifts may reveal values that are latent. Meanwhile, Drucker
(1994, 1999, 2005) points out that this period of outstanding
social and technical transformation evolved during a particu-
lar moment in the history of humanity that he labels
"Knowledge Society." Nevertheless, Machlup (1962) docu-
mented empirically for the case of the United States that the
knowledge society was created by a shift in the nature of
work.
At the turn of the millennium, there were various expres-
sions of a lack of morality exacerbating corruption at differ-
ent societal levels. In fact, at present, societies assume high
costs owing to ethical failures originating in an evident lack
of leadership and oriented management processes that lead
some authors to identify a "pathological mutation" in capi-
talism itself (Hart, 2001; Pfaff, 2002). For these authors, it is

Knowledge Workers and Virtues in Peter
Drucker's Management Theory
Alvaro Turriago-Hoyos1, Ulf Thoene1, and Surendra Arjoon2
Abstract
The fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis and frequent disregard for labor, environmental, and social standards have
instilled new vigor into the study of ethics and virtues. In the contemporary knowledge society, the issue of which virtues the
modern day workforce needs to possess is of crucial significance. This study specifies the virtues laid out in the management
theory of Peter Drucker (1909-2005), focusing upon the conceptual category of the knowledge worker as the primary unit
of the contemporary information and innovation-based knowledge society. The idea and role of intellectual virtues are not
yet fully developed in the literature, especially as those identified in this article are the source of critical and creative thinking.
This intervention, therefore, identifies prudence, effectiveness, excellence, integrity, and truthfulness as the knowledge
worker's intellectual virtues, whereas practical wisdom, responsibility, cooperation, and courage are seen to constitute the
knowledge worker's moral character.

as if a new expression of capitalism exists that has trans-
formed the traditional values of an owner's capitalism into
the new values of a manager's capitalism which functions
primarily to enrich corporate managers as a social grouping.
All of these new circumstances stem from changes in the
current economic system, demonstrating the weakening of
links among management, ethics, and morality.
In addition to all these novelties in ethics and morality,
technical change must also be taken into account. Nowadays,
it is hard to ignore the ubiquitous nature and importance of
information and communications technologies (ICT) and
their centrality in all spheres of social, economic, and politi-
cal life. The technical change brought about by ICT has
become a reality in many socioeconomic transformations,
driving remarkable trends, especially with respect to the
worldwide workforce. According to Miller (2001), the
"twentieth century has marked transitions in the developed
world from an agricultural to an industrial to an information-
based society" (p. 147). "As the primary workforce has
evolved from farmers to labourers to knowledge workers, the
bases of wealth, power, and social interaction have moved
from land to mass production to e-commerce," Miller (2001,
p. 147) adds.
In summary, social transformations have entailed high lev-
els of corruption, together with a migration of owner capital-
ismtomanagercapitalisminaknowledgesocietyenvironment
implying technological, social, and ethical changes that call
for new management approaches: "It is easy to look good in a
boom. But also, every boom . . . puts crooks in at the top"
(Drucker & Zahra, 2003, p. 11). In other words, economic
highs bring about financial predators as well as prosperity. In
this regard, Kurzynski (2009, p. 358) concludes that contem-
porary management has improved profitability by raising
productivity and streamlining, downsizing, outsourcing, and
out-competing the competition. All these factors lead us to
understand and accept that the origin of many current troubles
in diverse areas such as finance, government, sports, labor,
and pharmaceuticals can be found in a deficient function of
morality, leadership, and management in organizations
(Arjoon, Turriago-Hoyos, & Thoene, 2015).
Following on from these introductory paragraphs, the sec-
ond section discusses the role of knowledge workers within
the knowledge society. In the third section, we synthesize
Drucker's management theory following Maciariello (2009).
The fourth section summarizes knowledge workers' charac-
teristics from a perspective that considers their intellectual
virtues and practical wisdom as an obligation and an attribu-
tion of knowledge workers. We analyze knowledge workers'
intellectual virtues and moral character in the fifth section,
which is followed by the concluding paragraphs.
The Role of Knowledge Workers in the
Knowledge Society
Drucker (1985) praises the relevance that management has
wrought for the transition from the managerial toward the
entrepreneurial economy, stating that
[m]anagement is the new technology (rather than any specific
new science or invention) that is making the American economy
into an entrepreneurial economy. It is also about to make
America into an entrepreneurial society. Indeed, there may be
greater scope in the United States . . . for social innovation in
education, health care, government, and politics than there is in
business and the economy. And again, entrepreneurship
in society . . . requires above all application of the basic concept,
the basic techné, of management to new problems and new
opportunities. (pp. 15-16, emphasis in original)
Drucker's (1985) analysis of capitalism leads him to hypoth-
esize links between technological changes and the manage-
ment response to new social trends. To demonstrate this
relationship, he argues that capitalism has faced two crucial
periods (managerial and entrepreneurial economy) through-
out the evolution of management.
According to Drucker (1985), "[w]hat is happening in the
United States is . . . a profound shift from a `managerial' to
an `entrepreneurial' economy" (p. 1). The entrepreneurial
economy relies upon knowledge generation as the source of
wealth in society. Improving, exchanging, and protecting
knowledge are the main challenges to management

nowadays. In addition, in the current historical epoch,
Drucker (1985) states that management is a new knowledge
area that forms the basis of traditional companies, especially
those in high-tech industries. The application of high tech-
nology, especially through the deployment of ICT, is an
expression of the knowledge society.
Drucker (1994) develops more sociological ideas about
the knowledge society in The Age of Social Transformation,
where he argues that "[t]he old communities--family, vil-
lage, parish--have all but disappeared [and their] place has
been taken by the new unit of social integration, the organi-
zation [simultaneously] is a means to a person's ends, a tool"
(p. 72). Human organization mediates between the individual
and society. Besides, Drucker (1994) claims that, as the main
source of wealth, knowledge implies a new worldwide socio-
economic order in which its allocation will be the compass
needle of social and economic development based on knowl-
edge. This enables competitiveness to be improved and mea-
sured. According to Drucker (1994), "[the] knowledge
society will inevitably become far more competitive than
any society we have yet known [and especially] more com-
petitive for individuals than were the societies of the begin-
ning of this century, letalone earlier ones" (p. 68).
At the advent of the entrepreneurial economy and knowl-
edge society, there has emerged a new social class that
Drucker refers to as "knowledge workers" (Kelloway &
Barling, 2000), whose principal function is the generation of
knowledge. Crucially, "[k]nowledge work is not defined by
quantity [but] by its results" (Drucker, 1967, p. 7). As a new
social class of specialized workers, knowledge workers will
demand new rules of management because they
will give the emerging knowledge society its character, its
leadership, its social profile. They may not be the ruling class of
the knowledge society, but they are already its leading class.
And in their characteristics, social position, values and
expectations, they differ fundamentally from any group in
history that has ever occupied the leading position. (Drucker,
1994, p. 64)
Nevertheless, recent research suggests that knowledge work-
ers are not immune to experiencing "unfilled aspirations and
[a] sense of stagnation" (Costas & Kaerreman, 2016, p. 61).
It is important to address what would appear to be new
social class conflicts within the knowledge society. For
Drucker (1994),
A society in which knowledge workers dominate is under threat
from a new class conflict: between the large minority of
knowledge workers and the majority of people, who will make
their living traditionally, either by manual work, whether skilled
or unskilled, or by work in services, whether skilled or unskilled.
(p. 64)
Furthermore, an additional socioeconomic variable pro-
ducing change is innovation. The key question is where
innovation originates. The answer becomes rapidly evident
as innovation is inherent in knowledge workers' own func-
tions, expressed by entrepreneurship. Knowledge workers
have to bring about innovation (Magnier-Watanabe & Senoo,
2010). Drucker (1997) saw himself as a knowledge worker--
perhaps impressed by the Kudos knowledge workers as
agents possess--having reflected on various key moments of
his personal life and professional career, as well as on the
lives of historical figures, and especially on the works of his
personal friend and intellectual mentor JosephA. Schumpeter
(1883-1950).
In summary, the knowledge society, according to Drucker,
is the new evolving environment that supports change
through the influence of innovation. Innovation stems from
intrinsic goods and affects on productivity and output. As an
activity, it sits alongside the process of converting the mis-
sion into the achievement of results. Drucker (1985) suggests
that innovation is a discipline and entrepreneurship must be
learned, exploited, and integrated into the activities of an
organization (Maciariello, 2009). Knowledge workers are an
organization's main actors whose key function is to generate
knowledge, which is the backbone of innovation. Knowledge
in this context should be understood as technical knowledge
that has the power to improve the "can-do" attribute.
In this way, it becomes the leading dimension of the pro-
ductive process, the primary condition for its expansion, and
the key driver of competitive advantages within and among
societies. Besides, knowledge has strong sociological impli-
cations as it has the social significance of language, writing,
and printing (Stehr, 2015). Knowledge implies the capacity
for action in social life. This means that the realization and
implementation of knowledge depends upon the social, eco-
nomic, and intellectual context (Stehr, 1996). For these rea-
sons, knowledge has to be available, interpreted, and linked
to local circumstances.
Peter Drucker's Management Theory
Drucker is considered the father of modern management and
a leading analyst of social change. He began to deploy his
intellectual interests in the mid-1930s when he emigrated to
the United States. His new life in America drove him to for-
mulate some critical considerations concerning the function-
ing of society, inspired by the harsh experience he endured
during the build-up to the Second World War, when totalitar-
ian political regimes were spreading throughout Europe.
Drucker's (1939) first writings in his adopted country were
The End of Economic Man--The Origins of Totalitarianism,
and The Future of Industrial Man (Drucker, 1942). In these
works, he studies the functioning of capitalism and social-
ism, concluding that the hedonistic and materialistic goals of
the idealized homo economicus would lead these socioeco-
nomic systems to eventually fail. The homo economicus is,
of course, an abstraction that both capitalism and socialism
founded and promoted as an important ideal of effectiveness.

Indeed, his conclusion is short and concise: "Economic Man
has not only made himself superfluous through his material
successes; he has also failed politically, socially and meta-
physically" (Drucker, 1942, p. 196).
In 1954, Drucker became a management consultant at
General Motors, the world's biggest corporation at the time,
providing him with firsthand experience of the analysis of
management processes. Prior to this, The Concept of the
Corporation (Drucker, 1946) was his first systematic reflec-
tion on the functions and structures of large businesses. For
example, he identified basic principles such as decentraliza-
tion, promotion, and training that any firm should consider to
be competitive. If it is true that Drucker structured a theoreti-
cal management model identifying some outstanding princi-
ples, he "seldom brought these together into an integrated
system" (Maciariello, 2009, p. 35).
This lack of a holistic systemic vision challenged
Maciariello (2009) to formulate a number of proposals con-
cerning a "Drucker Management System" (DMS) which inte-
grates and places marketing and innovation at the forefront.
Maciariello develops a holistic model of Drucker's manage-
ment work--with the major purpose of evolving and validat-
ing an organization's "theory of the business" (p. 36). Within
this theoretical framework, we see the knowledge worker as
equivalent to an executive. Maciariello's proposal acknowl-
edges the overall integration of an executive's human actions
that should pursue effectiveness in marketing and innovation.
Executive effectiveness is the main goal of these special-
ized agents, according to this model. The analytical model is
deployed in four categories--skills, practices, tasks, and
spirit of performance (i.e., the culture, the way that work gets
done)--that should be put into practice considering social
impacts and the common good of society (Drucker &
Maciariello, 2006; Maciariello, 2009). Implicitly, this man-
agement theory recognizes that, in Drucker's thought, effec-
tiveness is the basic and necessary condition of an executive's
actions. To delimit the functions of agents, we will consider
the addition and interaction of skills, practices, spirit of per-
formance, social impacts, and the good achieved by any
human being or agent within this Druckerian model (Drucker,
1946, 1954). Each of these dimensions incarnates a virtue
within an executive's mind, whereas they are simultaneously
the essence of motivation that grants the executive skills,
tasks, and practices necessary to fulfill their functions.
At this stage of the article, it is possible to point to ethical
issues and the morality in Drucker's thought. This last point
of view demands making value judgments about the morality
of human actions. One of Drucker's most important intel-
lectual influences, the thought of Joseph A. Schumpeter,
classified the economic factor of work into entrepreneurs,
workers, and capitalists. Although Drucker acknowledges
the individual roles of the entrepreneur, the manager, and the
worker, contemporary knowledge society demands that all of
these types take on the responsibilities and tasks of the
knowledge worker.
Initially, we clarify that there are two types of workers in
Drucker's model. The first are manual workers identified
with managerial capitalism who work on the basis of pre-
established routines with the ultimate goal expressed as
improving productivity. The second are knowledge workers
identified with entrepreneurial capitalism. In principle, from
Drucker's (1985, 1999) perspective, manual workers have a
low margin of initiative and creativity. His analysis, how-
ever, needs to be seen against the background of U.S. indus-
trial productivity during and after the Second World War.
The role of manual workers in Drucker's models is over-
shadowed by the role played by knowledge workers. Yet we
should also be aware that a fair number of service workers
are engaged in the production and distribution of knowledge
(Machlup, 1962).
The Characteristics of the Knowledge
Worker
Human action is an outstanding variable in our analysis of
knowledge workers' characteristics, intellectual virtues, and
moral character. Human action is an effective intervention in
processes. A process is a series of events that are underway.
According to Drucker (1967), "[t]o be effective is the job of
the executive [and] the executive is, first of all, expected to
get the right things done" (p. 1, emphasis in original). As
homo sapiens faber, persons intervene in physical processes
by means of technology. If they had not intervened in a vari-
ety of issues, many things would not exist. Therefore, human
action takes on a creative and innovative sense (Polo, 1993).
As active beings who modify processes, people bring about
future scenarios. Following classical thinking, we can divide
human action into productive action and government action
(Polo, 1993). Productive action refers to material and physi-
cal processes (Polo, 1993). Government action refers to poi-
esis or bringing forth, coming into being, and it is political in
the sense that it implies interrelationships among actors. The
truly practical in political action is language (Polo, 1993).
Government action aims for improvement of societal
actors by seeking to further their development via virtues,
especially via dialogue (Polo, 1993). Prudence is the intel-
lectual virtue, and practical wisdom is the human character
trait underpinning government action. Applied to the prac-
tice of management and the business world, government
action refers to the activities of effective executives and
managers who give orders within the confines of a frame-
work of norms, but who at the same time have to obey and
reflect on their actions. Productive action and government
action are interdependent phenomena. The former is impos-
sible to achieve without the latter. Interdependency brings
about effectiveness.
Human action is related to ethics. Ethics is composed of
virtues, the common good, and norms (Polo, 1993). As
opposed to vices, virtues demarcate an ultimate objective,
which by definition is good. Human action requires goals,
Turriago-Hoyos et al. 5
motivation, and resources (Polo, 1993). As we have seen,
norms are implicit in government action.
A knowledge worker is a knowledge generator. As wealth
generators par excellence, their human action contributes to
the most effective performance of the knowledge society.
Nowadays, knowledge workers "own the tools of produc-
tion" (Drucker, 1994, p. 71). More explicitly, Drucker (1994)
states that, as individuals,
knowledge workers are dependent on the job. They receive a
wage or salary. They have been hired and can be fired. Legally
each is an employee. But collectively they are the capitalists;
increasingly, through their pension funds and other savings, the
employees own the means of production. (p. 71)
Drucker outlines a number of personal characteristics that
shape knowledge workers' productivity. More specifically,
he argues that, as opposed to the manual worker, the "knowl-
edge workers themselves define what the task is or should
be" (Drucker, 1999, p. 145). Furthermore, Drucker (1999)
stresses that the knowledge society imposes responsibility
for their productivity on individual knowledge workers
themselves. In other words, "managing oneself" and being
autonomous are central features of work in the knowledge
society insofar as a knowledge worker needs to become
aware of personal strengths via feedback analysis, self-
examination, and building self-awareness (Drucker, 2005,
pp. 101-102).
Failing to follow these steps on a regular basis can easily
lead to "intellectual arrogance" and "bad habits," which
deter "effectiveness and performance," eventually having a
negative effect on an individual's manner (Drucker, 1999,
p. 102). Perhaps more vital to managing oneself, however, is
the issue of a knowledge worker's values. Drucker refers to
this issue as the "ultimate test," and warns that "what one
does well--even very well and successfully--may not fit
with one's value system" or the value system of the organiza-
tion a knowledge worker operates in (Drucker, 2005, p. 105).
Moreover, a central element in the life of a knowledge
worker is the contribution the individual makes to an enter-
prise and to society at large. Put differently, a knowledge
worker's preoccupations need to be,
What should my contribution be? . . . What does the situation
require? Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my
values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs
to be done? And finally, what results have to be achieved to
make a difference? (Drucker, 2005, p. 106, emphasis in original)
Moreover, managing oneself entails "taking responsibil-
ity for relationships" as, generally, "people work with oth-
ers and are effective with other people" (Drucker, 2005,
p. 107). Owing to the fact that the modern workplace is a
complex site of human action with a diverse set of tasks and
responsibilities, understanding and knowing one's cowork-
ers and "communicating sufficiently" are pivotal factors in
taking responsibility (Drucker, 2005, p. 107). In short,
according to Drucker (2005), nowadays enterprises "are no
longer built on force but on trust"; people do not actually
need to get along, but they must "understand one another."
(pp. 107-108)
Furthermore, Drucker (1985) follows a Schumpeterian
approach, defining "[i]nnovation [as] the specific tool of
entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an
opportunity for a different business or a different service" (p.
17). Knowledge workers should "[continue] innovation [as]
part of [their] work, [their] task and [their] responsibility"
(Drucker, 1999, p. 142). Being innovative also implies the
need for "continuous learning on the part of the knowledge
worker," "continuous teaching," and prioritizing quality over
quantity of output (Drucker, 1985, p. 17; 1999, p. 142), activ-
ities which we can link with love of knowledge, love of
learning, and tenacity (see Table 1).
A knowledge worker should be seen "as an `asset' rather
than a `cost'" and they should prefer "to work for the organi-
zation in preference to all other opportunities" (Drucker,
1999, p. 142). Innovation is a process of basic and applied
research-generated knowledge, so innovation produces
results which should be judged by its aims. Finally, human
action is the conscious, free, and effective intervention in a
temporal process (Polo, 1993).
The Intellectual Virtues and Moral
Character of the Knowledge Worker
Taking into consideration that Drucker's work could be con-
ceptualized as a management system, as Maciariello (2009)
proposes, and acknowledging the ethical problems of our
age, the knowledge worker's actions and patterns of behav-
ior need to be explored via a set of virtues. Virtues design
good and stable human qualities, perfecting human intelli-
gence and will by establishing capacities to know the truth
and to excel in their actions to flourish within an environ-
ment that promotes freedom. Virtue is right conduct. The
"virtuous person" is the person who practices virtues (Melé,
2009, p. 87). Virtues should be exercised daily to reach the
ideal of human virtuousness. In a nutshell, intellectual vir-
tues can be taught and learned, whereas moral character
(moral virtues) may be acquired by action, doing, repetition,
"and by avoiding its opposite" (Melé, 2009, p. 87).
Drucker's thought has deep Aristotelian roots (Kurzynski,
2009). Aristotle coined the term eudaimonia, which can be
translated as "happiness" or human flourishing, a notion that
includes both behaving well and faring well. In short, a life
that is complete and satisfying as a whole to the last, which
is at the same time one's highest or supreme good (MacIntyre,
1984).
Several authors have identified a number of intellectual or
epistemic virtues (de Bruin, 2013; Rawwas, Arjoon, &
Sidani, 2012; Rego, Cunha, & Clegg, 2012; Roberts & Jay
Wood, 2007), but they are not grounded in any philosophical
6 SAGE Open
or conceptual framework. We can understand the list of intel-
lectual virtues within an Aristotelian framework (Macaulay
& Arjoon, 2013). This framework identifies five founda-
tional categories within which the list of virtues identified by
the various authors fit: understanding (the ability to grasp
truths without discursive reasoning), wisdom (the ability to
understand realities in light of ultimate causes), science (the
ability to grasp conclusions in some specialized knowledge),
art (the ability to make useful and artistic things), and pru-
dence (the ability to discern the purpose of human activity
and choose the appropriate means to achieve it).
Although understanding, wisdom, and science are directed
toward knowledge, art and prudence are geared toward
action and production. Table 1 provides the integral compo-
nents of each of the five intellectual virtues, which are impor-
tant for knowledge workers to possess and exercise. Table 1
was developed by matching the theoretical (the literature)
with the practical (Drucker's extensive work). From a survey
of the literature of the intellectual or epistemic virtues, we
categorized the integral components (de Bruin, 2013; Hart,
2001; Rawwas etal., 2012).
The cardinal virtues of practical wisdom (prudence in
classical nomenclature), justice (friendship), courage (forti-
tude in classical nomenclature), and moderation (temperance
in classical nomenclature) develop the will. Prudence can be
seen as both an intellectual and a moral virtue (Pieper, 1965).
In other words, we can learn prudence (i.e., identifying the
right thing to do in a given situation) by instruction and by
action or repetition.
According to Drucker (2000), the virtue that guides the
study of ethics in the West is prudence or practical wisdom.
"Practical wisdom therefore aids practical rationality in iden-
tifying the right thing to do in each situation, in resolving
conflicts between spontaneous motivations, and also in pro-
viding rational motivations" (Melé, 2009, p. 87). "Prudence
`informs' the other virtues; it confers upon them the form of
their inner essence. . . . Prudence works in all the virtues; and
all virtue participates in prudence" (Pieper, 1965, p. 7-8).
Knowledge workers' actions are in the public domain and
subject to judgment, analysis, discussion, and interrogation.
Prudence demands exemplary behavior of social agents. In
the West, prudence has sometimes ended in "hypocrisy"
because it is nuanced in elaborated and judicious public rela-
tions procedures (Drucker, 2000). Prudence is the intellec-
tual virtue that supports all others. Second, prudence
contributes to the moral character trait of responsibility that
ensures the virtue of effectiveness in production processes
and governance.
The whole idea of responsibility is associated with the capability
of answering for one's own acts. [Responsibility] presupposes
freedom; that is, that individuals who act are in control of their
actions [and] a responsible person is one who acts with
deliberation about his deeds and their consequences. (Melé,
2009, pp. 101-102)
If a knowledge worker is self-managed and receives
ongoing feedback, it is due almost entirely to the fact that
they accept instruction and guidance, that is, coachability
(see Table 1). Truthfulness (speaking the truth and not con-
cealing it) is the intellectual virtue that ensures self-knowl-
edge and discernment (see Table 1), but it is also supported
by previous feedback activity carried out by superiors and
partners to achieve an effective process (Drucker, 2005).
Truthfulness also requires a certain dose of the moral charac-
ter trait of courage, "persevering or pursuing what is good in
spite of obstacles" (Melé, 2009, p. 88), to achieve consistent
and constant corrective processes.
For Drucker (2000), another aspect is Confucianism,
marking an important difference between Eastern and
Western paradigms, which Drucker refers to as the Ethics of
Interdependence, and which we link with responsibility as an
element of knowledge workers' moral character. We can
assimilate interdependence with respect to others in personal
relationships by taking into account hierarchical position, for
example, from subordinates to chiefs. In the Eastern Ethics
of Interdependence, all agents have obligations which are
socially oriented (Fernando & Moore, 2014). Confucian eth-
ics considers the abuse of strength and power in any relation-
ship to be unethical. Harmony is finally achieved if equity is
present in individual duties.
Drucker (1954) explicitly identifies the morality required
in the work of management, stating that
management . . . needs concrete, tangible, clear practices. These
practices must stress building on strength rather than on
weakness. They must motivate excellence. And they must
express and make tangible that spirit is of the moral sphere, and
that its foundation therefore is integrity. (p. 146)
In fact, "integrity . . . or the lack thereof . . . has enormous
economic implications [and] integrity is a factor of produc-
tion as important as labour, capital, and technology" (Erhard
& Jensen, 2014, p. 2).
For Drucker (1957, 1986), managerial practices must be
based on individual integrity and morality. "Integrity confers
unity in making decisions coherent with [an individual's] per-
sonal life project, and in integrating various relationships
(family, business, and so on) into one's personal life. The
opposite of integrity is corruption" (Melé, 2009, p. 210). As
Fernández (2009) points out, Drucker recognizes the spiritual
connection between individuals and their contribution to soci-
ety, so that by channeling knowledge into performance, people
advance their spiritual selves and improve social justice.
Kurzynski (2009) summarizes the work of management,
stating that
Drucker regarded the business corporation as a human
organization, a social organization, a community and micro-
society of the larger macro-society, in addition to being an
economic entity. His management philosophy is based on a
Turriago-Hoyos et al. 7
communitarian philosophy grounded in the belief that even in
our individualistic society people still seek connection, meaning
and purpose. (pp. 359-360)
Put differently, this perspective highlights the importance of
the individual, and of the individual within the community.
As a cornerstone of Drucker's theoretical management foun-
dations, it is possible to claim that, within the organizational
life, there are two primary assumptions.
The first is that management should consider the person
as a whole, in other words, someone with virtues, responsi-
bilities, and purpose. Second, the organization must be
responsible for developing the people employed by it but
also bear responsibility to society, that is, sustain the achieve-
ment of the common good. We also argue that it is advisable
to analyze the ethical scope of innovation in the knowledge
society because it is human action par excellence, and for
this reason, it is possible to frame ethics and value
judgments.
In fact, if knowledge workers are responsible for their own
actions, they then seek control over the consequences of inno-
vation. They can carry out this reflection or "feedback analy-
sis" (Drucker, 2005, p. 102), which considers processes and
results, not only by having consciousness and control of their
actions (limited form of self-knowledge) but also by master-
ing the processes that facilitate the advancement of innova-
tion. Innovators may be responsible for these future events by
maintaining a constant willingness to correct and rectify, and
also complete tasks, which ties in with thoroughness, open-
mindedness, and intellectual honesty (see Table 1).
Furthermore, innovators are responsible for their actions
in the process itself, whether a complete or incomplete pro-
cess, whether it is starting or ending, and whether the agent
discovers that the process is likely to produce undesirable
effects. Polo (1993) argues that it is radically unethical when
there is no intervention in the process, in spite of knowing,
for instance, the malignant effects of an action. It is also not
ethical if nothing is done. Active and hands-on intervention
is prudent because it seeks to achieve control today of future
effects. The corrective involves formulating practical wis-
dom or prudence.
Another important ethical reflection pertains to moral
character and, more specifically, to collaborative action or
cooperation. This action should be expedient owing to col-
lective human action always being performed in specialized
teams. Innovation is a process and an activity that necessi-
tates learning by interacting, and applying foresight and cul-
tivating curiosity (see Table 1). This collaboration also means
having effective access to sources of information. The notion
of collaboration is linked to the principle of the common
good. According to Melé (2009), "living in society, and more
specifically, in relationships with other people does not
always come about due to purely utilitarian interests.
Collaborating and cooperating with others, and even helping
people, can be regarded as an end in itself." (p. 84)
In summary, as information is the pillar of knowledge,
and knowledge, in turn, is pure organized information gained
through research advanced by interdisciplinary teams, then
research into the knowledge society is absolutely indispens-
able, as if this is lacking, the outcomes pertaining to effec-
tiveness and competitiveness are likely to be disturbing.
In short, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and work-
ers in the knowledge society are all knowledge workers. The
common function of all coincides with the generation of
knowledge, which is at the same time essential to bring about
innovation. Value judgments imply reasoning about the
morality of any action, good or bad. If virtues are defined as
something that implies doing good, we can point out that any
action that does not fulfill the requirement of a virtue is not a
moral action.
Conclusion
In the first place, some intellectual virtues and moral charac-
ter traits of knowledge workers are considered on an indi-
vidual level. These are prudence, effectiveness, excellence,
integrity, truthfulness, practical wisdom, responsibility,
cooperation, and courage. The same features, required by the
contemporary human labor collective, are elevated to organi-
zational and societal levels with respect to the fulfillment of
the common good. The common good is simply a designa-
tion to live the intellectual virtue and moral character of
effectiveness and responsibility, both inside organizations
and in society, under the umbrella of the authority principle.
We also establish that Drucker identifies two different
ethical systems. The first deployed in Western societies in
which prudence is the guiding virtue, and the second, which
Drucker denominates Ethics of Interdependence, in which
authority relationships are subscribed to that flourish in
Eastern societies.
Morality is constituted as outcomes of human actions and
is deployed with respect to excellence, integrity, exemplarity,
and right behavior. It is worth noting that processes exist to
improve ethics and morality; practices must stress building
upon strengths rather than upon weaknesses. At an organiza-
tional level, the existence of organizations responsible for
developing the competencies and virtues of the people they
employ should be mandatory. Organizations and their boards
of directors should consider the potentiality of persons as a
whole to improve their capabilities.
Drucker's theoretical framework of knowledge workers is
appropriate to describe the new person's functions within the
knowledge society because it indicates the main functions
needed to achieve innovation. Knowledge supports innova-
tion, and knowledge workers principally generate
knowledge.
Currently, knowledge is the main source of human-gener-
ated wealth in the knowledge society. We can also state that
innovation is pure human action and it has a profoundly
moral character and significance as it is based on the social
8 SAGE Open
nature of human beings. Consequently, it also provides the
criteria for the discernment, orientation, and ultimate organi-
zational foundations of social interaction.
For Drucker, the functions of knowledge workers are
grounded in a strong and well-defined ethical and anthropo-
logical framework. These functions arise from the need to
achieve effectiveness and competitiveness in organizations
and in society as a whole. These functions are specialized,
covering both the individual and social outlooks.
The complete fulfillment of knowledge workers' func-
tions of applying critical and creative thinking promotes the
accomplishment of the principle of the common good guid-
ing the primary goal of human affairs with respect to produc-
tion, trade arrangements, political institutions, and social
welfare.
To develop lines of future research, we may consider how
management can foster practical ways to develop knowledge
workers'intellectual virtues and moral character in the work-
place. Furthermore, implications for management education
should be reflected upon to "harness the power of each indi-
vidual's unique reasons to act in a virtuous manner" in con-
temporary knowledge society (Manz, Marx, Manz, & Neal,
2008, p. 117). As a case in point, Drucker (1967) insists that
"effectiveness can be learned" over time via a process of rep-
etition that is similar to other pedagogical processes (p. 21).
Yet we should also be aware that cultivating knowledge
workers' virtues and moral character is fraught with diffi-
culty because each virtue has a corresponding vice by defect
on one hand, and a vice by excess on the other. This then
represents a real challenge both for the development of virtu-
ous behavior in the workplace and for management
education.
