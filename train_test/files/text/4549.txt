Abstract
Objective: To determine whether patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
following cardiac arrest who received mild hypothermia have improved mortality and neurological
outcomes compared with those who do not receive mild hypothermia.
Methods: Online database searches were performed for English-language randomized controlled
trials published before March 2014, comparing mild hypothermia (32­34C) with normothermia
or hypothermia other than mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest, in adults with ROSC. Data were
independently extracted using a dedicated form. Mortality rates and neurological outcomes were
recorded for the overall population and for in-hospital and prehospital mild hypothermia
subgroups.
Results: Seven articles were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Mild hypothermia
demonstrated no significant beneficial effects in terms of overall mortality or neurological
outcomes. In addition, no significant outcome differences were observed between the pre- and in-
hospital subgroups.
Conclusions: On the basis of this limited data set, mild hypothermia does not improve mortality
rates or neurological outcomes in patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest, regardless of the timing
of the hypothermia. Larger trials need to be carried out to confirm these findings.

Introduction
The beginning of the modern concept of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can
be traced to the documentation of 14
patients who survived cardiac arrest with
the application of chest compressions,
reported by Kouwenhoven et al.1 in 1960;
a few months later, the combination of
rescue breaths and chest compressions was
introduced,2 while defibrillation was first
described in 1962.3 Despite improvements
in the development of CPR techniques and
an increase in the training of health care
providers and bystanders, it is still difficult
to ensure good neurological outcomes for
patients who survive cardiac arrest.
Postcardiac arrest care has been high-
lighted since the publication of the latest
American Heart Association guidelines in
2010;4 therapeutic hypothermia is one
strategy suggested to protect the brain
and other organs in patients who remain
comatose after the return of spontaneous
circulation (ROSC). Since being advocated
by a number of international resuscitation
guidelines,4­6 therapeutic hypothermia
after ROSC has gained widespread use.
In 2012, a meta-analysis reported reduced
in-hospital mortality rates after cardiac
arrest in adults with ROSC who presented
with nonshockable initial rhythms, and
who underwent hypothermia.7 More
recently, two large trials showed that nei-
ther the application nor the timing of onset
of targeted controlled mild hypothermia
(32­34C) after cardiac arrest improved
patient outcomes.8,9 As new data bring
novel results, the benefits and risks of mild
hypothermia remain uncertain in patients
recovering from cardiac arrest.
The aim of this meta-analysis was to
systematically review the literature, to ascer-
tain differences firstly in mortality rates and
secondly in neurological outcomes, in
patients after ROSC (regardless of the
arrest rhythm) who underwent targeted
controlled mild hypothermia compared
with those who did not. In addition, mor-
tality rates and neurological outcomes were
investigated in those receiving mild hypo-
thermia with different onset times (pre- or
in-hospital) compared with patients not
receiving mild hypothermia.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
Online searches of the PubMedÕ, Elsevier,
Cochrane (Central) and Web of Science
databases from inception until March 2014
were performed, using the following search
keywords and terms: (``therapeutic hypother-
mia'' OR ``induced hypothermia'' OR
``inducing hypothermia'' OR ``induce hypo-
thermia'' OR ``resuscitation hypothermia''
OR ``mild hypothermia'' OR ``moderate
hypothermia'' OR ``resuscitative hypother-
mia'' OR ``hypothermia treatment'') AND
(``cardiac arrest'' OR ``heart arrest'' OR
``cardiogenic shock'' OR ``cardiopulmonary
arrest'' OR ``arrest of the heart'' OR ``resus-
citation of the heart'' OR ``cardiorespiratory
arrest'') AND (``resuscitation'' OR ``cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation'' OR ``resuscitated''
OR ``cardiac resuscitation''). The search was
limited to studies published in English.
Data screening and extraction
Citation titles and abstracts were independ-
ently screened by two reviewers (T.Y. and
472 Journal of International Medical Research 43(4)
F.L.). All randomized controlled clinical trials
of any duration that compared mortality rates
and neurological outcomes in human adult
patients (aged> 18 years) with ROSC after
cardiac arrest, who underwent therapeutic
targeted controlled mild hypothermia (32­
34C) compared with those did not (patients
with normothermia or hypothermia other
than mild hypothermia), irrespective of the
presenting rhythm, were identified. All poten-
tially eligible papers were retrieved in full.
The references of all retrieved articles
were examined to identify further poten-
tially eligible studies. Trial characteristics
and outcomes were independently recorded
by the two reviewers using a predesigned
data abstraction form. In cases of disagree-
ment, all the authors jointly reviewed the
article in question until a consensus was
reached. Any duplicate papers were identi-
fied and excluded from the meta-analysis.
The Jadad scale10 was used to assess the
quality of the data reporting and random-
ization, concealed allocation and degree of
blinding, and patient flow description. High-
quality studies were defined by a score of !3.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint was to investigate the
potentially beneficial role of targeted con-
trolled mild hypothermia, in terms of mor-
tality rates in patients with ROSC after
cardiac arrest; cut-off points for mortality
as defined within each study were used in the
meta-analysis. The secondary endpoints
were to determine whether hypothermia
can improve neurological outcomes in
patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest
and whether differences in either outcome
(mortality or neurological) could be found
in subgroups of patients receiving pre- or in-
hospital mild hypothermia, compared with
patients not receiving mild hypothermia.
To evaluate and compare neurological
outcomes, the definition of a `good' neuro-
logical outcome used within each study was
used in the meta-analysis. When the neuro-
logical outcome was evaluated using the
cerebral performance category scale, values
of 1­2 were considered to be a `good'
neurological outcome, while values ! 3
were considered to be a `poor' outcome.
Statistical analyses
Data related to mortality rates and neuro-
logical outcomes in the overall population
and in the in-hospital and prehospital sub-
groups were extracted; a consecutive ana-
lysis for subgroups was performed (filtered
according to the analysed variable).
For dichotomous outcomes, risk ratios
(RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were used to represent the effects of mild
hypothermia on different outcomes. An RR
of < 1 favoured the use of therapeutic mild
hypothermia. Data were pooled only when
adequate clinical and methodological simi-
larities were present between the studies.
The homogeneity assumption was
assessed using the I2 value, which describes
the percentage of total variation across
studies that is due to heterogeneity rather
than chance. I2 was computed as
I2 ¼ 100% Â (Q À df)/Q, where Q is the
Cochran heterogeneity statistic and df is
the degrees of freedom. A value of 0%
indicates no observed heterogeneity; larger
values indicate increasing heterogeneity.
Whenever I2 was >25% (i.e. heterogeneity
was found), random effects model results
were presented as the primary analysis.
Publication bias was estimated using a
funnel plot. Parametric variables were pre-
sented as mean Æ SD; nonparametric vari-
ables were presented as the median and
interquartile range. Statistical analyses
were conducted using RevManÕ Review
Manager software, version 5.0 (Nordic
Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark).
A P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance.

Results
A flowchart of the study selection is given in
Figure 1. Seven English-language articles
published before March 2014 fulfilled the
inclusion criteria.8,11­16 A total of 1527
patients were included in the meta-analysis.
Of these, 773 patients underwent targeted
controlled mild hypothermia, while 754 were
controls. The characteristics of the studies
are shown in Table 1.
Mild hypothermia and mortality
Dichotomous data on mortality were
reported in all the trials included in the
meta-analysis.8,11­16 The overall population
in the studies was homogeneous (P ¼ 0.32,
I2 ¼ 15%). Figure 2 shows the effect of
targeted controlled mild hypothermia on
mortality; mild hypothermia did not exert
a statistically significant protective effect on
mortality in patients with ROSC after car-
diac arrest.
Similarly, after stratifying for the pre-
and in-hospital subgroups, no statistically
significant mortality differences were
observed between the patients undergoing
mild hypothermia and controls. No evidence
of publication bias was found using a funnel
plot assessment (Figure 3).

forms.8,11­16 Overall, the studies were shown
to be heterogeneous (P ¼ 0.09, I2 ¼ 44%). As
shown in Figure 4, mild hypothermia was
not associated with a statistically significant
improvement in neurological outcome in the
overall population. After subgroup stratifi-
cation, no statistically significant differences
in outcomes were observed between the pre-
or in-hospital subgroups and controls. No
publication bias was detected using a funnel
plot assessment (Figure 5).
Discussion
To date, seven randomized clinical trials
have analysed the impact of pre- or in-
hospital mild hypothermia in patients with
ROSC after cardiac arrest, compared with
control groups.8,11­16 After the first encoura-
ging studies,11 later publications showed no
benefit of mild hypothermia in terms of
neurological outcomes or mortality rate
after cardiac arrest.8,9 The present meta-
analysis was performed to clarify the role of
targeted controlled mild hypothermia in
adults compared with patients not receiving
this treatment, based on current published
data. The main findings were that mild
hypothermia does not benefit patient
mortality, regardless of the initiation time
(pre- or in-hospital), and does not improve
neurological outcomes after ROSC.
Since the advent of CPR, technological
development and research have introduced
distinct and novel ways of improving the
mortality rates and neurological outcomes,
in patients with cardiac arrest and ROSC.
Although the use of defibrillators and the
increased number of individuals trained in
CPR have improved survivorship,17

secondary brain injuries established within
minutes after cardiac arrest are the major
cause of increased hospital mortality or
long-term neurological problems.
The first description of the use of hypo-
thermia was published around 1960.18,19
The hypothesis that hypothermia could be
used to reduce brain oxygen consumption
has been considered since the early 1990s;
animal studies have shown that hypother-
mia can improve mortality and neurological
outcomes after cardiac arrest.20­24
Preliminary studies performed in the light
of these data demonstrated improved neuro-
logical outcomes in patients treated with
mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest, com-
pared with historical controls.25­28
In 2002, the Hypothermia after Cardiac
Arrest Study Group11 reported that, among
patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest due
to ventricular fibrillation, systemic cooling
to a bladder temperature between 32 and
34C for 24 h increased the survival rate
(P ¼ 0.02) and the likelihood of favourable
neurological outcomes (P ¼ 0.009) com-
pared with standard normothermic care.
Laurent and coworkers14 then found that
the combined use of haemofiltration and
hypothermia may decrease patient mortality
and improve final outcomes in patients with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Similarly,
Hachimi-Idrissi et al.13 observed improved
neurological outcomes in patients treated
with mild hypothermia after cardiac arrest;
they linked these findings to reduced serum
S-100b protein concentrations. However,
Kim et al.15 reported a slight but nonsigni-
ficant improvement in mortality and neuro-
logical outcomes in patients receiving
prehospital hypothermia compared with
Figure 5. Funnel plot for publication bias for the effect of mild hypothermia (32­34C) on neurological
outcomes. Each point represents a separate study included in the meta-analysis. Squares indicate studies

normal standard care; the authors stated
that the study was unlikely to have had
sufficient power to demonstrate a significant
difference between treatments, having only
$60 patients per branch. At the end of 2009,
another study was published by
Ka
¨ ma
¨ ra
¨ inen et al.,16 who demonstrated the
feasibility of prehospital hypothermia but,
similar to Kim et al.,15 the study was
underpowered for mortality or neurological
outcome assessments.
Currently, the international guidelines by
the American Heart Association4 state that
comatose adult patients with ROSC after
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with shockable
rhythm should be cooled to 32­34C for 12­
24 h, and that comatose patients with ROSC
after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a
nonshockable rhythm or in-hospital cardiac
arrest may also benefit. The guidelines indi-
cate the knowledge gaps regarding the opti-
mal temperature, treatment method, disease
onset, treatment duration and rewarming
rate; therefore, further investigation is
required to determine the benefit of post-
cardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia after
nonshockable and in-hospital cardiac arrest.
In 2013 and 2014, two large trials inves-
tigating the role of hypothermia in patients
with ROSC after cardiac arrest were pub-
lished. Kim and coworkers9 investigated
whether prehospital intravenous cooling
could improve mortality and neurological
outcomes in 688 patients after resuscitation
from cardiac arrest, with both shockable and
nonshockable rhythms, compared with 671
patients with in-hospital cooling only.
However, this study was not included in the
present meta-analysis as both groups of
patients received mild hypothermia. In
another study by Nielsen et al.,8 939 uncon-
scious patients were randomized to receive
normo- or hypothermia after cardiac arrest
resuscitation on hospital admission within
240 min of ROSC. The vast majority of the
patients presented with a shockable rhythm.
In both studies, the authors found no
significant between-group differences in
mortality or neurological function. These
results were also consistent in all the sub-
groups analysed.
The results of the present meta-analysis
are consistent with the large study by Nielsen
et al.,8 showing no protective effects on
mortality or neurological outcomes asso-
ciated with mild hypothermia. However,
since 939 (61%) of the 1527 patients included
in the meta-analysis were from the study of
Nielsen et al.,8 it had greater statistical
weight. Therefore, limitations of this single
study should also be considered in the meta-
analysis; these included investigator aware-
ness of the treatments assigned to patients,
use of unknown sedatives and neuromuscu-
lar blocking agents, methods of hypothermia
induction and goal threshold temperatures.
It cannot be excluded that possible rea-
sons for the lack of benefits from hypother-
mia are the large patient heterogeneity and
considerable advances in patient care over
the last 10 years. The mortality rate was
48% in the Hypothermia after Cardiac
Arrest Study in 200211 (which considered
only shockable presenting rhythm); how-
ever, in the most recent trial by Kim et al.9 in
2014, though not included in the present
meta-analysis, the overall mortality in a
similar population was 36%. In addition,
as Rittenberger and Callaway29 highlighted
in their editorial, most studies prior to
Nielsen et al.8 were influenced by the fact
that the most common cause of death was
abandonment of life support because of
perceived poor neurological prognosis,
which is not certain in the long term. A
further limitation of the meta-analysis is a
possible selection bias in the trials chosen
because of the English-language restriction.
It should also be noted that the control
groups were quite heterogeneous in the
treatment they received: the control group
in Nielsen et al.8 received controlled
temperature management targeted to
36C, whereas other groups received no
480 Journal of International Medical Research 43(4)
temperature control (normothermia)11 or a
median bladder temperature targeted to
37C (though sometimes >37.5C).12
In conclusion, according to data from
seven randomized controlled trials reviewed
in the present meta-analysis, the induction
of mild hypothermia seems to have no role
in reducing mortality rates or ameliorating
long-term neurological outcomes in patients
with ROSC after cardiac arrest, regardless
of the timing of the initiation (pre- or in-
hospital).
