Background--Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined by the Third Report of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) using
criteria easily applied by clinicians and researchers. There is no standard pediatric definition.
Methods and Results--We defined pediatric MetS using criteria analogous to ATP III as 3 of the following: (1) fasting
triglycerides 1.1 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); (2) HDL 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL), except in boys aged 15 to 19 years, in
whom the cutpoint was 1.2 mmol/L (45 mg/dL); (3) fasting glucose 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL); (4) waist
circumference 75th percentile for age and gender; and (5) systolic blood pressure 90th percentile for gender, age,
and height. MetS prevalence in US adolescents was estimated with the Third National Health and Nutritional Survey
1988 to 1994. Among 1960 children aged 12 years who fasted 8 hours, two thirds had at least 1 metabolic
abnormality, and nearly 1 in 10 had MetS. The racial/ethnic distribution was similar to adults: Mexican-Americans,
followed by non-Hispanic whites, had a greater prevalence of MetS compared with non-Hispanic blacks (12.9%, [95%
CI 10.4% to 15.4%]; 10.9%, [95% CI 8.4% to 13.4%]; and 2.5%, [95% CI 1.3% to 3.7%], respectively). Nearly one third
(31.2% [95% CI 28.3% to 34.1%]) of overweight/obese adolescents had MetS.
Conclusions--Our definition of pediatric MetS, designed to be closely analogous to ATP III, found MetS is common in
adolescents and has a similar racial/ethnic distribution to adults in this representative national sample. Because
childhood MetS likely tracks into adulthood, early identification may help target interventions to improve future
cardiovascular health. (Circulation. 2004;110:2494-2497.)
Key Words: metabolic syndrome  pediatrics  risk factors
The metabolic syndrome (MetS), also called insulin resis-
tance syndrome, has been described in many ways, in
part owing to the lack of a "gold standard" diagnostic test.
The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)1 defines adult MetS
as 3 or more of the following abnormalities: hypertriglycer-
idemia, low HDL, high fasting glucose, excessive waist
circumference, and hypertension, on the basis of associations
with adverse cardiovascular outcomes derived from large
research trials.1 Adults with MetS are at greater risk for
cardiovascular disease2 and diabetes mellitus.3 Ford et al,4
using the Third National Health and Nutritional Survey
(NHANES III), estimated the syndrome affected 25% of US
adults.
The MetS has not been well characterized in children and
adolescents in terms of criteria, prevalence, or clinical impli-
cations, although studies have examined MetS abnormali-
ties.5,6 We propose a definition of MetS in adolescents based
closely on the ATP III1 and, using NHANES III data,
describe its prevalence in US children aged 12 to 19 years.
Methods
ATP III defines adult MetS as 3 or more of the criteria described in the
Table. To generate a definition appropriate for children aged 12 to 19
years, we extrapolated from adult criteria. Triglyceride (TG) and HDL
cutpoints were taken from equivalent pediatric percentiles.7 We defined
hyperglycemia using the ATP III cutpoint. ATP III uses waist circum-
ference as a measure of central obesity, and percentiles for age and
gender have been most associated with central obesity in children across
genders and races8; therefore, we used percentiles comparable to the
adult male cutpoint of the 70th percentile.9 Because normal pediatric
blood pressure varies significantly, we used the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute's recommended cutpoint of 90th percentile for
age, gender, and height.10
NHANES III is a national data set collected between 1988 and
1994, weighted to represent the population of noninstitutionalized
US civilians not living on Indian reservations and aged 2 years and

older. It uses a multistage, stratified sampling design and has been
well described.11 The present sample was drawn from children aged
12 to 19 years who underwent physical examinations and fasted
before blood testing.
Statistical Methods
For the 1960 children aged 12 to 19 years who participated in the
examination of the NHANES III survey and fasted for at least 8
hours, the prevalence of MetS was calculated overall and by gender,
age group, and race or ethnicity. Because of the survey's complex
sampling design, estimates and standard errors were calculated in
Stata12 with the sampling weights provided, to be representative of
the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Sample weights are
adjusted for nonresponse. For estimates of prevalence, subjects with
missing information on MetS criteria were assumed not to have met
that criterion. A second set of estimates was calculated solely for
subjects with nonmissing data for all 5 criteria. MetS prevalence was
also estimated in the subgroup of adolescents with body mass index
85th percentile for age and gender.
Results
Low HDL, hypertriglyceridemia, and central obesity were
common among the present sample, whereas hyperglycemia
and hypertension were infrequent (Figure 1). As in adults,
hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL were most common
among non-Hispanic whites and least common among non-
Hispanic blacks, whereas Mexican-Americans had the great-
est prevalence of high waist circumference (data not shown).
Nearly two thirds (63.4% [95% CI 61.2% to 65.6%]) of
adolescents had at least 1 metabolic abnormality, and 9.2%
[95% CI 7.8% to 10.6%] qualified as having the full MetS.
Prevalence was comparable for boys and girls and for older
and younger adolescents (9.5% [95% CI 7.5% to 11.5%]
versus 8.9% [95% CI 7.1% to 10.7%] and 8.3% [95% CI
6.5% to 10.1%] versus 10.3% [95% CI 8.3% to 12.3%],
respectively). Four or more abnormalities were found in 35
children (1.6%); no child had all 5 criteria. Mexican-
Americans, followed by non-Hispanic whites, had a greater
prevalence of MetS compared with non-Hispanic blacks
(12.9% [95% CI 10.4% to 15.4%], 10.9% [95% CI 8.4% to
13.4%], and 2.5% [95% CI 1.3% to 3.7%], respectively).
Figure 2 shows the prevalence of MetS by gender and
race/ethnicity. Information was not available on every crite-
rion for all participants. When the 1707 adolescents with
complete data were analyzed, the prevalence of 3 or more
elements of MetS was slightly higher (10.1% [95% CI 8.5%
to 11.7%] versus 9.2%) and the CI was slightly wider. Among
children with BMI 85th percentile for age and gender, the
prevalence of MetS was 31.2% [95% CI 28.3% to 34.1%].
Discussion
Using a pediatric definition based closely on ATP III, we
found the prevalence of MetS in US children aged 12 to 19
years was approximately 1 in 10. In overweight/obese chil-
dren, a notable 1 in 3 had MetS. Moreover, two thirds of all
adolescents had at least 1 metabolic abnormality. Our find-
ings are consistent with research in young adults, in whom the
10-year incidence of MetS was 8% to 12% in the nonobese
and 34% to 41% in the obese, although this definition used
more extreme lipid cutoffs and body mass index instead of
waist circumference.13 Our results are not surprising in view
of the high and rising rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes
mellitus in US children.
Pediatric researchers have investigated individual metabol-
ic abnormalities that increase cardiovascular risk5 and found
they track from childhood to adulthood, leading one to
suspect MetS might also track into adulthood.14 In fact,

childhood obesity predicts the development of MetS in
adulthood.15 MetS has an important immediate impact: ado-
lescents with MetS have lower exercise capacity than obese
and normal-weight controls.16 Obesity alone increases the
risk of hypertension, cholecystitis, and slipped capital femo-
ral epiphysis and is associated with psychosocial symptoms
in children.17
Diverse definitions of pediatric MetS have been used in
various populations. The Quebec family cohort study14 used
skinfold measurements and mean blood pressure, criteria
more cumbersome for the primary pediatrician and less
closely based on ATP III than the present definition. The
Taipei Children Heart Study18 used its own population
distribution for cutpoints. A Hungarian study defined MetS
by more extreme lipid cutpoints, body fat measurements
instead of waist circumference, and 24-hour blood pressure
monitoring. In a high-risk US population of obese children,
39% had MetS when defined by body mass index instead of
waist circumference, lipid levels 95th percentile (or 5th
percentile for HDL), and oral glucose tolerance testing.19 The
MetS definition given by Cook et al,6 based on 1992 National
Cholesterol Education Program guidelines and devised before
ATP III and wide recognition of MetS, uses more restrictive
lipid and abdominal circumference cutpoints, which leads to
lower prevalence estimates in adolescents of 4%. Translat-
ing their definition to pediatric percentiles, an HDL level of
40 mg/dL represents the 10th to 25th percentile in boys and
10th to 15th percentile in girls, lower than the adult 40th
percentile. The higher triglyceride cutpoint of 110 mg/dL
represents the 85th to 95th pediatric percentile, also higher
than the adult 75th to 85th percentile. The abdominal circum-
ference cutpoint of the 90th percentile is higher than the 75th
percentile used in the present study. In contrast to other
criteria, our pediatric definition was based closely on the
more inclusive ATP III adult criteria, considering the effects
of age, gender, and puberty, and therefore captures a larger
population of adolescents.
Our study should be interpreted in light of its limitations.
The primary limitation is that study outcomes depend on our
definition of MetS, a problem inherent to any extrapolation of
the adult definition to a pediatric population. We used
standard cholesterol cutpoints that form the basis for ATP III,
and National Cholesterol Education Program/American
Academy of Pediatrics, guidelines. Cholesterol levels, partic-
ularly HDL levels in males, are affected by puberty,20 yet
pediatric norms from Lipid Research Clinic data are available
by age, not by Tanner stage. Because these normative data
were published in 1979 and may not reflect contemporary
earlier puberty rates, we may have overestimated the number
of boys with abnormally low HDL. However, decreases in the
age of puberty have primarily affected girls, not boys, which
minimizes this effect. We used waist circumference as a
convenient surrogate for visceral obesity, which is associated
with insulin resistance, the likely pathophysiological under-
pinning of MetS. Waist circumference is a less accurate but
more practical and lower-risk indicator of visceral obesity
than abdominal CT or MRI, is the method used by ATP III,
and is available in NHANES III. Fat distribution is affected
differentially by puberty in girls and boys; we attempted to
control for this using age- and gender-based waist circumfer-
ence percentiles. The present study is also limited by the
database. Although NHANES is highly representative of
most of the United States, American Indian reservations are
not included in the survey. The rate of obesity and type 2
diabetes mellitus is particularly high in some American
Indian populations21; one would expect higher MetS rates in
these groups.
The impact of these data may be far-reaching. In adults,
MetS correlates with increased rates of type 2 diabetes
mellitus and cardiovascular disease.2,3 Practitioners should be
aware of the clustering of metabolic abnormalities in chil-
dren, and affected children should receive risk-reducing
interventions. Understanding the prevalence of pediatric
MetS may foster interventions and research; further investi-
gation could better illuminate its pathophysiology and rela-
tionship to cardiovascular disease.
