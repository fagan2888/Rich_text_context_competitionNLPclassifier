Validity	of	Education	Information	on the Death Certificate
Paul D.	Sorlie 1 and Norman].	]ohn son2





We compared education as recorded on the death certificate with education ascertained before death from a household survey of 10,423 persons age 25 years or more who died in 1989. There was a tendency for the decedent's education to be reported at a higher level on the death certificate than at

baseline. Of those who were  reported  as high school graduates on the  death  certificate,  38% reported  that  they  had  less than a high school education at baseline. The bias was more pro­ nounced in older than younger decedents. (Epidemiology 1996;7:437-439)







In 1989, the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death in­ cluded, for the first time, provision for recording the decedent's education. The recommendation for the Standard Certificate was that the decedent's highest grade completed be recorded on the certificate. In 1989, 21 states achieved at least a 90% completion rate for this information. 1
  Since education level is a new and potentially difficult piece of information to obtain, it is important to evalu­ ate the validity of this assessment. To this end, we examined data from the National Longitudinal Mortal­ ity Study (NLMS) for 10,433 persons age 25 years or more at baseline who had died in 1989. We compared the education level (highest grade completed) from the death certificate with the education from the baseline survey.

Methods
The NLMS is a prospective study of mortality occurring in combined samples of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.2 The samples are taken from selected Cur­ rent Population Surveys (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census. The Current Population Survey is a complex probability sample of households that are sur­ veyed monthly to obtain demographic, economic, and social information about the U.S. population. Interviews are conducted by telephone and personal visit. The response rate is about 96%. For the current analysis, the

NLMS has identified 12 Current Population Survey files in which persons were followed for mortality using the National Death Index (NDI). The surveys chosen were conducted in March 1973, February 1978, March 1979,
April 1980, August 1980, December  1980, March 1981,
March 1982, March 1983, March 1984, March 1985, and September 1985. Education was deter r11ined by the question ''What is the highest grade or year of regular school [name] has ever attended?'' and ''Did [name] complete that grade?''
  We used the National Death Index to determine deaths occurring in the years 1979-1989 for those in the NLMS sample. The NDI is a computer file of all deaths in the United States since 1979 and is maintained and operated by the National Center for Health Statistics. 3 The NDI has been shown to be an effective and accurate means of ascertaining deaths using personal identifi­ ers.4-7 For the analyses in this paper, we have included only deaths occurring during 1989, since it was in this year that the education item was first included on the standard death certificate.
  The inforr11ation on the death certificate is usually recorded by the funeral director after questioning the next-of-kin or other informant. On the 1989 Standard Certificate, the National Center for Health Statistics suggested that education be recorded as highest grade completed and that the certificate have one recording box labeled ''Elementary/Secondary (0-12)'' and an­ other labeled ''College (1-4 or 5 +) ." In 1989, 21 states had a completion rate of at least 90% for education, and 5 states did not include education on the  certificate for at least part of that year (see footnote to Table 2 for listing of states). Since most education is completed by age 25 years, we have assumed that there is little change in education between the time of the baseline assess­ ment and the time of death in persons age 25 years or more.

Results
Table 1 shows the percentage of persons in each baseline education category from the Current Populatio n S urvey who fell into each education category as reported on the death certificate. The death certificate shows the h ighest agreement with the baselin e educatio n of 4 ye ars of h igh school. For baselin e education levels less than 4 ye ars of high school, the death certificate educa t io n te n ds to be
recorded at a higher level of educ ation than the baselin e level.

may be derived from the decennial census or some other source in which questions on education may vary from the Current Population Survey data collected in the 1980s. Our estimates of bias may not be applicable in those situations.
  The collection of information for  the  death certificate by the funeral director is similar  to  the  collection  of proxy information in  epidemiologic  studies  when  the case individual is either deceased or in capacit a ted.9 In a study of the validity of proxy responses, 80 wives were given a questionnaire similar to one given to their hus­ bands, who were cases in a lung cancer st ud y.1 For the men who reported their education as  less  than  high school, wives incorrectly reported their husbands' edu­ cation 31% of the time, and for the men who reported education as greater than high school, the wives incor­ rectly reported their husbands' education 29o/o of  the time. For both groups, the wife tended to report the education as completion  of  high  school.  In  another proxy response validation study, the next-of-kin of cases and controls from a colon cancer study were queried.11 Exact agreement on education grade was around 80o/o if the proxy response was  obtained  by  interview  and around 70o/o if the response was by a self-administered quest1 onna1 re.
