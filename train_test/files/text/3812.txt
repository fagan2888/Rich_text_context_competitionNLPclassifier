Introduction
According to the Norwegian Patients' Rights Act (1999), all
patients have a basic human right to receive treatment and
care according to their needs. Elderly patients thus have a
right to expect their nutritional needs to be fulfilled during
hospitalization. Several studies have shown that a large pro-
portion of elderly patients are already undernourished, or at
risk of becoming so, on hospital admission (Imoberdorf et al.,
2010; Lucchin et al., 2009). For the majority, nutritional sta-
tus often deteriorates during their hospital stay (Rasmussen,
Holst, & Kondrup, 2010). Considering the increase in the
aging population in Norway, as in the rest of Europe, it may
not be unreasonable to assume that the proportion of under-
nourished elderly patients will rise. It is therefore vital that
hospitals have a nutritional care policy ensuring proper iden-
tification and treatment of patients suffering from undernutri-
tion and the risk of undernutrition. In recent decades, there
has been a growing awareness of undernourishment in the
health care sector in Europe (Council of Europe, 2003;
Ljungqvist, van Gossum, Sanz, & de Man, 2010). In line
with European guidelines (Howard et al., 2006; Kondrup,
Allison, Elia, Vellas, & Plauth, 2003; National Collaborating
Centre for Acute Care, 2006), national professional guide-
lines on prevention and treatment of undernutrition were
published for the first time in Norway in 2009 (The Norwegian
Directorate of Health, 2009). Nevertheless, there is a limited
body of research available today exploring how undernour-
ishment is addressed for elderly patients in the hospital set-
ting in Norway. A cross-sectional study designed to estimate
the prevalence of nutritional risk among elderly patients was
conducted at a large university hospital in the period 2011 to
2013 (H. K. Eide, Saltyt Benth, Sortland, Halvorsen, &
Almendingen, 2015). To assess nutritional care, data on iden-
tifying and treating nutritional risk were also recorded, which
was the aim of the present article.
Background
At present, there is no clear consensus on a method for iden-
tifying undernutrition (Cederholm et al., 2015; Rasmussen
et al., 2010). Moreover, the terms "undernutrition" and "mal-
nutrition" are often used interchangeably (Cederholm et al.,

Abstract
This article assesses nutritional care in identifying and treating nutritional risk in elderly hospitalized patients. A cross-sectional
study was conducted at a large Norwegian University hospital in the period 2011 to 2013. Data on nutritional risk and care
for elderly patients (70 years) without dementia were collected at 20 wards by 173 second-year nursing students in acute-
care clinical studies. A stratified sampling technique was utilized to improve the representativeness of the sample. In total,
508 patients (48.8% women) with a mean age of 79.6 years participated. The internationally and nationally recommended
nutritional care was not implemented at the hospital, suggesting that nutritional care for elderly hospitalized patients was not
adequate. This implies that the majority of the elderly patients nutritionally at risk are neither identified nor treated according
to their needs. The article highlights the importance of having systematic nutritional care practices to make it possible for the
hospital ward staff to routinely identify nutritional risk and initiate appropriate nutritional treatment measures.

2015). The following definition of malnutrition is, however,
widely used (Stratton, Green, & Elia, 2003): "A state of
nutrition in which a deficiency, excess or imbalance of
energy, protein, and other nutrients causes measurable
adverse effects on tissue/body form (body shape, size and
composition), function, and clinical outcome," whereby
undernutrition constitutes part of the deficiency. For elderly
in the hospital setting, a variety of physiological, psychologi-
cal, and social changes associated with the process of ageing
interact with disease processes, making this group of patients
particularly vulnerable to developing undernutrition (Morley,
1997; Norman, Pichard, Lochs, & Pirlich, 2008; Stratton
et al., 2003). Focus on optimal care for prevention and treat-
ment of undernutrition is therefore important for elderly hos-
pitalized patients.
Traditionally, nurses have been responsible for patients'
nutrition as part of caring for the patients' basic needs
(Henderson, 1997). Now, however, nutrition is generally
seen as an interdisciplinary field in which several hospital
professions (Jefferies, Johnson, & Ravens, 2011), including
physicians, nurses, clinical dietitians, and food service staff,
partake. Nevertheless, by being with the patients in a 24/7
context, the importance of nurses in identifying the need for
nutritional treatment and implementing appropriate nutri-
tional treatment measures should be underscored (Bonetti,
Bagnasco,Aleo, & Sasso, 2013; Jefferies et al., 2011). Nurses
represent the largest group of health care professionals work-
ing in hospitals, and influencing their approach to under-
nourishment may yield clinical benefits for elderly
hospitalized patients.
The Norwegian guidelines, largely in line with European
guidelines (Howard et al., 2006; Kondrup, Allison, et al.,
2003; National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care, 2006),
focus on four key recommendations that are to be imple-
mented into hospital routines (The Norwegian Directorate of
Health, 2009). First, for a routine identification of undernu-
trition and the risk of undernutrition, nutritional risk screen-
ing must be performed on all patients on hospital admission
and subsequently weekly. Hence, the term "nutritional risk"
covers both the concepts "the risk of undernutrition" and
"undernutrition." As undernutrition is easier to prevent than
to treat, it is preferable to identify this condition as early as
possible. This is especially true for older people whose nutri-
tional status recovers more slowly (Roberts et al., 1994;
Vellas, Albarede, & Garry, 1992). Second, when patients
screen positive for nutritional risk, a treatment plan must be
developed to establish severity and to consider appropriate
nutritional treatment measures. In many cases, this is based
on a more detailed nutritional assessment. Third, information
on nutritional status and treatment must always be docu-
mented in medical records. Fourth, this information must be
communicated to the next level of care in discharge letters.
Despite the fact that undernourishment can result in seri-
ous health consequences, such as prolonged hospital stays,
delayed recovery, and increased complications (Norman
et al., 2008), European studies demonstrate that this condi-
tion is often ignored for elderly patients in the hospital set-
ting (Bonetti et al., 2013; Vanderwee et al., 2011; Volkert,
Saeglitz, Gueldenzoph, Sieber, & Stehle, 2010). Norway
seems to be no exception (H. D. Eide, Halvorsen, &
Almendingen,2015;NorwegianBoardofHealthSupervision,
2013; Tangvik, Guttormsen, Tell, & Ranhoff, 2011). The
duration of an average hospital stay is decreasing in Norway
(Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care services, 2009), as
in the rest of Europe. However, shorter hospital stays do not
diminish the significance of providing adequate nutritional
care. On the contrary, as studies have shown that undernour-
ished patients have longer hospital stays (Feldblum et al.,
2009; Norman et al., 2008), this stresses the importance of
identifying patients nutritionally at risk and initiating appro-
priate treatment.
Method
Design
The cross-sectional study was conducted at a university hos-
pital in Norway. The university hospital provides health care
services for approximately half a million people living in
urban and rural municipalities. The patient population is het-
erogenic with respect to ethnicity and socioeconomic factors,
and covers about 10% of the Norwegian population. By
operating as both a local and regional hospital, the university
hospital offers locally based specialist services as well as
more specialized services.
The study was developed with multidisciplinary collabo-
ration between the researchers, the collegium at a nursing
bachelor education program, representatives from the uni-
versity hospital, and other experts in the field. Second-year
nursing students undergoing their acute and clinical care
practice studies at the university hospital collected data on
nutritional risk and nutritional care for elderly patients. The
students were instructed to participate as part of their obliga-
tory clinical training and education. In this way, the students
gained firsthand experience and increased awareness of
nutritional risk and of how recommended nutritional care is
carried out among elderly hospitalized patients.
Participants
Nine nutritional screening days were executed in the aca-
demic years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, and in total, 173
nursing students were in touch with the patients. The ward
nursing staff provided the nursing students with lists of all
elderly (70 years or older) patients admitted on the included
wards at 08.00 on the screening days, and these patients were
asked to participate. Terminal patients, that is, patients
assumed to be short-lived (less than 1 month) and patients
diagnosed with dementia, were excluded. Also excluded
were patients experiencing language difficulties, patients
Eide et al. 3
who were not present at the time of the screening due to
operations or examinations, and patients who were found
unfit to participate, for example, due to unconsciousness or
having contagious illnesses. The ward nursing staff in coop-
eration with the nursing students selected all eligible patients.
The study sample included patients admitted to 14 out of
16 medical and surgical wards at the university hospital, in
addition to four associated wards. Due to differences in the
patients' diagnoses, two wards were divided into two sub-
wards. A stratified sampling technique was utilized in the
data collection (Cochran, 1963). It tends to produce samples
that are most representative of the population in terms of
reduced sampling error. Correspondingly, sample size calcu-
lations adjusting for possible cluster effect due to stratifica-
tion were performed. The minimum sample size of 522 was
required to achieve a 95% degree of confidence with a length
10% at most for a prevalence of 30% nutritionally at risk,
while assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of
0.3 (Eide et al., 2015). In accordance with the stratified sam-
pling technique, the number of elderly patients proportional
to the ward size was consecutively included in the sample on
each ward. The size of ward was defined as the daily average
number of elderly patients based on the records from the last
6 months provided by the hospital's analysis department.
Sampling stopped on each ward when the intended number
of patients was reached. A statistician was responsible for the
statistical sampling design.
Data Collection
On the screening days, the students screened the patients for
nutritional risk and filled in a questionnaire for every patient
following instructions in a specially prepared manual. The
questionnaire included information about age, gender, num-
ber of days in hospital, weight, height, body mass index
(BMI), nutritional risk, and nutritional care.
Nutritional measurements. To identify nutritional risk, the stu-
dents used the 2009 translated Norwegian version (The Nor-
wegian Directorate of Health, 2009) of the Nutritional Risk
Screening 2002 (NRS2002) form (Kondrup, Rasmussen,
Hamberg, & Stanga, 2003). The form is recommended by the
European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism
(ESPEN) as well as the Norwegian Directorate of Health for
use in the hospital setting, and is a widely used screening tool
in Europe (Schindler et al., 2010) as well as in Norway
(Tangvik et al., 2011). The NRS2002 aims to detect patients
who will benefit from nutritional treatment due to undernutri-
tion and/or increased nutritional needs resulting from disease
(Kondrup, Allison, et al., 2003). According to the NRS2002
form, the patients were screened based on evaluations of BMI,
recent weight loss, dietary intake, and disease severity. The
screening form included an initial screening and a final screen-
ing. The final screening was conducted if the answer was
"yes" to any one of the questions in the initial screening.
Patients with a total score of 3 or more in the final screening
were classified as nutritionally at risk. A score of 1 was added
for patients older than 70. Weight was measured without shoes
and outer clothes in either a standing or sitting position to the
nearest 0.1 kg with apparatus available on the wards at the
time of data collection, following usual hospital practice.
Height was measured to the nearest 1 cm with a nonelastic
measuring tape, either in a standing position against a wall
without shoes or alternatively with half arm span if the patients
had problems standing (Kwok & Whitelaw, 1991). The BMI
was calculated as weight (kg) divided by the square of height
(m). The age-independent BMI classification system pre-
sented by the World Health Organization (WHO; 2006) was
used when categorizing patients' BMI.
Nutritional care. Questions regarding the nutritional care used
in identifying and treating nutritional risk was developed in
collaboration with representatives from the university hospi-
tal, for example, the chef, a clinical dietitian, and a research
and development nurse to ensure correct and relevant formula-
tions.All questions were based on the recommendations stipu-
lated in the Norwegian guidelines and the hospital's food
service practices at the time, and are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
The questions concerned the use of nutritional risk screening
tools and whether weight measurements were recorded on
admission and then on a weekly basis, the coding of undernu-
trition diagnoses (E43, E44, or E46) in line with the Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems (ICD-10). Furthermore, the questions included ini-
tiation and type of nutritional treatment measures. The nursing
students retrieved this information from the patients' medical
records. The availability of weighing apparatus at wards each
screening day was also noted in the questionnaires to deter-
mine whether the wards had the proper equipment needed to
routinely measure weight for their patients.
Data Analysis
Patient characteristics were described as means and standard
deviations (SDs) or frequencies and percentages, as appro-
priate. Nutritional routines and treatment were presented in
the form of frequencies and percentages. Differences in
nutritional routines and treatment between those nutrition-
ally at risk and those not at risk and between those with BMI
18.49 kg/m2 and BMI 18.5 kg/m2 were assessed by
Fisher's exact test. The analyses were conducted on anony-
mous data files. All tests were two-sided. The p values below
5% were considered statistically significant. The statistical
program IBM SPSS statistics Version 22.0 for Windows was
used for statistical analysis.
Pilot Study
To test the questionnaire used, a pilot study was performed at
the university hospital in autumn 2010 and spring 2011. The

pilot study involved totally 96 students screening 290 elderly
patients, and showed that the bachelor nursing education pro-
gram had an infrastructure that enabled the collection of data.
Ethical Statement
The study was completed in compliance with the guidelines of
the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Internal Privacy
Commission at the university hospital. The patients had to give
oral informed consent prior to participation. The researchers
received anonymously completed questionnaires and screening
forms from the students.As the data were anonymous, the study
was exempted from review by the Regional Committee for
Medical and Health Research Ethics (Ref. No. 2011/2088 A).
Results
Participation
The study population comprised 508 patients admitted to 20
hospital wards (Table 1). Due to a lack of reporting by some
students on patients who declined participation or were
excluded, only approximate information regarding participa-
tion status was known. Of 1,059 patients for whom participa-
tion status was known, 145 patients (14%) declined
participation, while 390 (37%) were excluded according to
predefined criteria. However, as the consecutive inclusion of
patients was performed, a somewhat low participation rate
should therefore not affect the data quality.
Patient Characteristics
Patient characteristics are outlined in Table 2. The study pop-
ulation consisted of 48.8% women. The average age was
79.6 years (SD = 6.4). In total, 201 (39.6%) patients were
nutritionally at risk, and mean BMI was 24.9 kg/m2 (SD =
4.9). The patients had been admitted to the hospital on aver-
age 5.3 days (SD = 6.3) at the time of data collection.
According to WHO's cutoff values, 6.5% were identified as
underweight, 48.0% as normal weight, and 45.5% as over-
weight. Of the 199 patients nutritionally at risk with non-
missing values, 32 (16%) were identified as underweight,
115 (58%) as normal weight, and 52 (26%) as overweight.
Nutritional Routines
Standing weights were available on all screening days at
70% of the wards, while at 20% of the wards, standing
weights were available only on at least one, but not all
screening days. At 10% of the wards, standings weights were
not available on any screening days. The availability of chair
weights varied even more: at 40% of the wards, chair weight
were available on all screening days; at 55% of the wards,
chair weights were available on some screening days; while

at 5% of the wards, chair weights were unavailable on all
screening days. Bed weight was available at only one ward
on one of the screening days. "Not available" implied that
the apparatus did not work, for example, the battery had run
down or there was no apparatus at the ward.
Nutritional routines performed at wards are outlined in
Table 3. Only six (1.2%) of 478 patients with nonmissing val-
ues had been screened for nutritional risk with a screening tool
by the hospital staff. Weight on admission was recorded for 46
(9.5%) of 483 patients with nonmissing values. Among 129
patients staying for longer than 7 days, weight within the last
week was recorded for 18 (14.0%) patients. Notably, weight
was recorded more frequently (p = .013) on admission for
patients admitted to surgical wards (14.9%) compared with
patients admitted to medical wards (6.9%), as well as more
often (p = .005) for patients who had been operated (18.0%)
compared with patients not operated (7.6%). No differences
(p = .425) were observed in weight recordings on admission
for patients nutritionally at risk and those not at risk, whereas
patients with BMI 18.49 kg/m2 (21.9%) were weighed more
frequently on admission (p = .028) compared with patients
with BMI 18.5 kg/m2 (8.9%) (Figure 1). Only seven (3.5%)
of 199 patients nutritionally at risk with nonmissing values
were diagnosed with undernutrition (E43, E44, E46).
Nutritional Treatment
Of the 201 patients nutritionally at risk, only 56 (31.5%)
received some form of nutritional treatment, 122 (68.5%) did
not receive any nutritional treatment, while nutritional treat-
ment was nonexistent for 23 patients (Table 4). More (p =
.010) patients nutritionally at risk received some form of
nutritional treatment compared with patients not at risk. Of the
patients nutritionally at risk, those with BMI 18.49 kg/m2
(53.6%) received some form of nutritional treatment more
often (p < .001) than those with BMI 18.5 kg/m2 (22.8%)
(Figure 1). Table 4 shows the types of nutritional treatment
measures recorded on patients. Although not frequently
recorded in the patients' medical records, the most common
treatment measures were adaptations to the eating situation,
adaptations of the normal diet and supplement drinks.
Adjusted diets, energy- and nutrient-enriched meals, snacks
between meals, and enteral and parenteral nutrition were sel-
dom used. Only eight (14.3%) of 178 patients nutritionally at
risk with nonmissing values had been referred to a clinical
dietitian.
Discussion
This is the first Norwegian cross-sectional study of such
scale assessing nutritional care used for identifying and treat-
ing nutritional risk among the hospitalized elderly. The
results demonstrate that the nutritional care management for
elderly patients without dementia at the participating hospi-
tal wards was inadequate. Recommended nutritional care

were not implemented in line with international and national
guidelines, suggesting that the majority of the undernour-
ished elderly, or those at risk of becoming undernourished,
are neither identified nor treated according to their needs.
Our results are in agreement with the findings of a qualitative
study in the same research project that was conducted in par-
allel at the participating university hospital (Eide et al.,
2015). This study, on nurses' experiences, revealed that
important elements in nutritional care for the undernourished
elderly seemed to be missing in clinical practice. These stud-
ies verify and reinforce each other by showing similar results.
The use of any nutritional risk screening tool was practi-
cally absent in the hospital, and there were no established
routines for measuring weight. There was also a lack of
appropriate weighing apparatus, for example, chair and bed
weights, which made it challenging to obtain the weight of
diseased elderly who are often bed-bound and/or in severe
pain. There did not seem to be a system to make it possible
for the ward staff to routinely identify nutritional risk, which
implies that many of the undernourished elderly or those at
risk of becoming so are left unidentified. This finding of sys-
tem failure is in accordance with other European studies on
elderly hospitalized patients (Bonetti et al., 2013; Vanderwee
et al., 2011; Volkert et al., 2010), as well as with the general
hospital population (Bavelaar, Otter, van Bodegraven, Thijs,
& van Bokhorst-de van der Schueren, 2008; Cereda et al.,
2010; Schindler et al., 2010; Tangvik et al., 2011).
Although the Norwegian guidelines represent an impor-
tant step toward better nutritional care, it remains to ensure
that these guidelines are implemented in hospital practice.
Interestingly, weight on admission was recorded more often
at surgical wards and for patients who had been operated,
although this was still rarely done. As weight information is
often required before the initiation of anesthetics prior to sur-
gery, many of these recordings were most likely obtained for
reasons other than evaluating nutritional status.
If appropriately targeted, nutritional treatment can pro-
duce various clinical benefits. For example, a recent review

concluded that protein and energy supplementation produces
a small but consistent weight gain in older people and may
have beneficial effects on both mortality and complications
(Milne, Potter, Vivanti, & Avenell, 2009). In this study, we
found a large discrepancy between the actual presence of
nutritional risk and patients receiving nutritional treatment.
About two thirds of patients nutritionally at risk received no
nutritional treatment at all. This is, however, not surprising,
bearing in mind the inadequate nutritional routines.
Nutritional treatment measures should always be imple-
mented in the order of priority outlined in the Norwegian
guidelines' "nutritional ladder" (The Norwegian Directorate
of Health, 2009). The simplest and cheapest way to provide
nutritional treatment is to get the patient to eat more of the
hospital food, either by adapting the normal diet or by serv-
ing an adjusted diet, snacks in-between meals, or energy- and
nutrient-enrichedmeals(Howardetal.,2006;Nieuwenhuizen,
Weenen, Rigby, & Hetherington, 2010). In addition, the eat-
ing environment is important (Howard et al., 2006;
Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2010). However, some patients strug-
gle to meet their nutrition requirements through the hospital
food alone, and supplement drinks and artificial nutrition
should be provided, in addition or as a substitute (Howard
et al., 2006; Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2010). Simple treatment
measures, such as adaptations to the eating situation or the
normal diet and supplement drinks, were more commonly
used than artificial nutrition. However, adjusted diet, energy-
and nutrient-enriched meals and snacks between meals were
seldom used. Because it was not possible to evaluate the
treatment recorded on individual patients, we do not know
whether the treatment was properly targeted. Nevertheless,
our results demonstrate that undernutrition and the risk of
undernutrition were clearly undertreated, a fact that corre-
sponds to other European studies on elderly patients (Bonetti
et al., 2013; Vanderwee et al., 2011; Volkert et al., 2010) and
to the general hospital population (Bavelaar et al., 2008;
Cereda et al., 2010; Schindler et al., 2010; Tangvik et al.,
2011). Notably, few patients nutritionally at risk were
referred to a clinical dietitian, suggesting that they were
rarely involved in the patients' treatment.
All elderly patients are potentially at risk of becoming
undernourished, including also patients with normal weight
and those overweight. In this study, more than 80% of the
patients nutritionally at risk were of normal weight or over-
weight. However, undernutrition and the risk of undernutri-
tion are easily overlooked for these patients compared with
patients who are underweight if nutritional risk screening is
not routinely performed. Suominen et al. demonstrated that
only the truly anorectic elderly patients were recognized as
undernourished (Suominen, Sandelin, Soini, & Pitkala,
2007). We found similar tendencies in our study, as patients
with BMI 18.49 kg/m2 were weighed more frequently on
admission and received nutritional treatment more often
when nutritionally at risk, compared with patients with BMI
18.5 kg/m2. The number of elderly people with high BMI is
increasing in the world's population, and it will be vital for
health care professionals to be aware that undernutrition and
the risk of undernutrition also occur among these patients.
Limitations
The high representativeness of the study sample was ensured
by using a stratified sampling technique (Cochran, 1963) in
data collection, warranting sufficient representation of each
participating ward.Adjustment for possible cluster effect due
to stratification was used in sample size calculations. Patients
from nearly all somatic medical and surgical wards at the
participating hospital were included in the sample, in addi-
tion to four associated wards. On this basis, the study sample
can be considered representative, and it provides a reliable
picture of nutritional care for elderly patients without demen-
tia at somatic wards.
The large number of students involved in data collection
might be seen as a shortcoming of the study. It can further be
assumed that the students had little prior research experi-
ence. However, persons central in planning and carrying out
this study were experienced in using students for the collec-
tion of research data (Sortland, Gjerlaug, & Harviken, 2013),
and two persons central to the research project were avail-
able to the students at the hospital on all screening days.
Moreover, an interrater agreement study conducted exhibited
an acceptable quality of the screening data (Eide et al., 2015).
The students were supervised in use of the screening form
and the questionnaire prior to each screening day, and were
instructed to participate to safeguard and optimize the data
collection.
As information retrieved from the patients' medical
records may not necessarily reflect the actual treatment and
care provided, due to poor documentation practices at the
hospital, actual care practices may have been underreported.
However, ensuring optimal documentation on nutritional
matters is one of the key recommendations stipulated in the
national guidelines (The Norwegian Directorate of Health,
2009) and forms an important part of adequate nutritional
care. There was a considerable amount of missing data on
nutritional treatment in this study, as well as frequent use of
"do not know" when reporting the usage of nutritional risk
screening tools at different wards. The lack of routines and
treatment found in this study probably reflects the difficulties
the students had in finding any information on nutritional
matters in the patients' medical records.
Conclusion
From the present study, we conclude that nutritional care rec-
ommended both internationally and nationally was not imple-
mented at the participating hospital wards, suggesting that
nutritional care for elderly hospitalized patients was not ade-
quate. This implies that the majority of the elderly patients
nutritionally at risk are neither identified nor treated according
8 SAGE Open
to their needs. There is a clear need as well as a high potential
for quality improvement in nutritional care so that the nutri-
tional needs of the undernourished elderly or those at risk of
becoming so can be fulfilled. The results presented in this
study will be important to consider when improving nutri-
tional care practices for the hospitalized elderly, and it will be
essential that nursing students receive proper nutritional edu-
cation and training to meet the substantial challenges related to
undernourishment in the hospital setting. The article highlights
the importance of having systematic nutritional care practices
to make it possible for the ward staff to routinely identify
nutritional risk and initiate appropriate nutritional treatment
measures.
