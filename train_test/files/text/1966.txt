Context: Migration is suspected to increase risk for de-
pressive and anxiety disorders.
Objective: To test the hypothesized increase in risk for
depressive and anxiety disorders after arrival in the United
States among Mexican migrants.
Design: We combined data from surveys conducted sepa-
rately in Mexico and the United States that used the same
diagnostic interview. Discrete time survival models were
specified to estimate the relative odds of first onset of de-
pressive disorders (major depressive episode and dys-
thymia) and anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety dis-
order, social phobia, panic disorder, and posttraumatic
stress disorder) among migrants after their arrival in the
United States compared with nonmigrant Mexicans who
have a migrant in their immediate family.
Setting: Population surveys in the United States and
Mexico.
Participants: Two thousand five hundred nineteen non-
migrant family members of migrants in Mexico and 554
Mexican migrants in the United States.
Main Outcome Measures: First onset of any depres-
sive or anxiety disorder.
Results: After arrival in the United States, migrants had
a significantly higher risk for first onset of any depressive
or anxiety disorder than did nonmigrant family members
of migrants in Mexico (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.94). Associations between migration and
disorder varied across birth cohorts. Elevated risk among
migrants relative to nonmigrants was restricted to the 2
younger cohorts (those aged 18-25 or 26-35 years at in-
terview). In the most recent birth cohort, the association
betweenmigrationandfirstonsetofanydepressiveoranxi-
ety disorder was particularly strong (odds ratio, 3.89; 95%
confidence interval, 2.74-5.53).
Conclusions: This is, to our knowledge, the first study to
compare risk for first onset of psychiatric disorder be-
tweenrepresentativesamplesofmigrantsintheUnitedStates
and nonmigrants in Mexico. The findings are consistent
with the hypothesized adverse effect of migration from
Mexico to the United States on the mental health of mi-
grants, but only among migrants in recent birth cohorts.

ABOUT 12 MILLION PEOPLE
living in the United States
in 2007 were born in
Mexico,1 constituting ap-
proximately30%oftheUS
foreign-born population, 25% of the US
Hispanicpopulation,and10%oftheMexi-
can-born population on both sides of the
Mexico-USborder.Mentalhealthresearch-
ers have hypothesized that adverse social
experiences inherent in the migration pro-
cesshaveanegativeeffectonmentalhealth
in this population.2,3 Two findings from
studies conducted in the United States are
consistent with this hypothesis. First,
among Mexican Americans (ie, people of
Mexican descent born in Mexico or the
United States), as among the US Hispanic
population more broadly, greater accul-
turation (ie, adoption of American pat-
terns of behavior) is associated with worse
mentalhealthstatus,includinghigherrates
of psychiatric and substance use disor-
ders.4-7 Second, among Mexican-born im-
migrants in the United States, those who
have been in the United States for longer
periods have worse mental health than
more recent arrivals.8 However, because
these studies are limited to comparisons
within the US population, neither of these
findings isolates the potential effect of mi-
gration on the migrants themselves.9,10
Only 1 pilot study11 has directly esti-
mated the effect of migration by compar-
ing the mental health of Mexican-born im-
migrants in the United States with that of

nonmigrants in the Mexican general population. That
study found that immigrants were at higher risk for mood
and anxiety disorders after migrating to the United States
compared with persons who remained in Mexico, but its
generalizability is limited by a very small sample of im-
migrants (n=75), all of whom were interviewed in En-
glish. These pilot findings indicated the need for a larger
study and a stronger methodological approach.
In this study, we compared a sample of Mexican-born
migrants (554 individuals; 259 men and 295 women) af-
ter their arrival in the United States with a sample of non-
migrants in Mexico (2519 individuals; 904 men and 1615
women) on their risk for first onset of a depressive or an
anxiety disorder. The samples come from epidemiologi-
cal surveys in which respondents were interviewed with
the same fully structured diagnostic interview. Respon-
dents in the United States had the choice of conducting the
interview in English or Spanish. In addition, in this study
we used an alternative analysis strategy to better control
for potential confounding of the effect of migration on de-
pressive and anxiety disorders that can arise from family-
level influences (eg, region or family socioeconomic sta-
tus). In the pilot study,11 family socioeconomic status was
adjusted for by including a covariate for parental educa-
tional level in the statistical model predicting onset of dis-
order.Inthepresentstudy,wecontrolledforabroaderrange
of these family-level premigration factors by restricting the
comparison sample to people in Mexico who have family
members in the United States but have not themselves mi-
grated. In contrast to statistically adjusting for confound-
ing by including measured covariates in a multivariable
model, restriction can reduce confounding from all family-
levelconfounders,whethermeasuredornot,makingitper-
haps the most effective method when a large number of
observations are available in the restricted sample.12
METHODS
In 2001 to 2003, epidemiological surveys of psychiatric disor-
ders were conducted in nationally representative samples of the
adult populations of Mexico13 and the United States14 using the
same fully structured diagnostic instrument, the World Men-
tal Health Survey Initiative Version of the World Health Orga-
nization Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(WMH-CIDI).15 Data from these surveys were combined to cre-
ate a transnational sample of Mexican-born individuals resid-
ing in Mexico or in the United States. Questions regarding the
migration experience of respondents and their family mem-
bers included in the Mexico survey were used to identify a rep-
resentative sample of individuals with a member of their im-
mediate family living in the United States (family members of
migrants). Questions regarding country of birth and age at mi-
gration included in the US survey were used to identify a rep-
resentative sample of Mexican-born immigrants and specify the
periods before and after their arrival in the United States. Data
from both surveys regarding age at onset of psychiatric disor-
ders were used to compare the risk for first onset among im-
migrants after their arrival in the United States with that of fam-
ily members of migrants residing in Mexico. Comparisons were
conducted for first onset of depressive disorders (major de-
pressive episode and dysthymia) and anxiety disorders (social
phobia, panic disorder or agoraphobia, generalized anxiety dis-
order [GAD], and posttraumatic stress disorder).
Data on the Mexican population came from the Mexico Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey,13 a survey based on a stratified mul-
tistage area probability sample of household residents in Mexico
aged 18 to 65 years who lived in communities of at least 2500
people. Interviews were conducted with 1 randomly chosen
member of each selected household from September 2001
through May 2002. The response rate was 76.6%, with 5782
respondents interviewed. Data on the 2519 nonmigrants who
had a migrant in their immediate family were used in the pres-
ent study. The nonmigrant family members of migrants were
sampled independently from the US migrant sample (ie, they
were not relatives of the US migrants interviewed for this study).
The sample is representative of individuals in families of cur-
rent Mexican-born immigrants in the United States.
DataontheMexican-AmericanpopulationintheUnitedStates
came from 2 component surveys of the Collaborative Psychiat-
ricEpidemiologySurveys,16 theNationalComorbiditySurveyRep-
lication (NCS-R)17 and the National Latino and Asian American
Survey (NLAAS).18 The NCS-R was based on a stratified multi-
stage area probability sample of the English-speaking house-
hold population of the continental United States.19 Interviews
were conducted from February 2001 to April 2003 with a 70.9%
response rate. The NLAAS was based on the same sampling frame
as the NCS-R, with special supplements to increase representa-
tion of the survey's target ethnic groups.16 The NLAAS inter-
views were conducted from May 2002 to December 2003 with a
75.5%responseratefortheLatinosample.Integratedsurveysam-
pling weights were based on the common Collaborative Psychi-
atric Epidemiology Surveys sampling frame20 to properly adjust
the combined sample to represent the ethnic composition of the
US population. Data on the 554 Mexican-born respondents to
the NCS-R or the NLAAS were used in this study.
Study procedures were approved by the institutional re-
view boards of Harvard Medical School; the University of Michi-
gan, Ann Arbor; and the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon
de la Fuente.
ASSESSMENTS
TheDSM-IVcriteriaformajordepressiveepisode,dysthymia,GAD,
panicdisorder,agoraphobia,socialphobia,andposttraumaticstress
disorder were assessed with the WMH-CIDI, a fully structured
face-to-face diagnostic interview administered in respondents'
homes by a trained nonclinician interviewer using a laptop com-
puter. Clinical reappraisal studies in the NCS-R21 and the WMH
Surveys,22 inwhichtheWMH-CIDIdiagnoseswerecomparedwith
structured clinical interviews administered by mental health pro-
fessionals, showed good concordance for mood and anxiety dis-
orders. The Spanish-language version of the WMH-CIDI, used
in the Mexico National Comorbidity Survey and the NLAAS, was
developedfollowingWorldHealthOrganizationinstrumenttrans-
lation guidelines, with field testing before the start of data col-
lection.23
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Mexican-born migrants in the United States were compared with
nonmigrant family members of migrants in Mexico. The Mexi-
can comparison group was selected to control for family-level
differences between migrants and nonmigrants that might affect
risk for mood and anxiety disorders after migration to the United
States, such as differences in childhood socioeconomic status.
When a sufficiently large sample is available, restriction of the
comparison group is preferable to statistical adjustment in a mul-
tivariable model because it adjusts for measured and unmea-
sured family-level confounders while requiring fewer modeling
assumptions. Discrete time survival models with time-varying

covariates24,25 were used to estimate risk for onset of disorders
associated with being in the United States and to adjust for age
atinterviewandsex.Timewasdefinedbychronologicalage.Being
a migrant in the United States was treated as a time-varying co-
variate. An advantage of survival analysis with time-varying co-
variates is that it allows consideration of independent variables
for which the value for any given person may change over time.
Aperson'smigrationstatus(theindependentvariable)canchange
from not being a migrant (ie, living in Mexico) to being a mi-
grant in the United States at any time until the onset of the psy-
chiatric disorder of interest or the age at interview (whichever
comes first). To construct a conservative test of the effect of mi-
gration, disorders with onset in the same year that a person mi-
grated were coded as having onset before migration.
Additional specifications were used to examine potential
variations in the risk associated with being in the United States
by sex, birth cohort, and chronological age. Sociological re-
search has demonstrated that migration is associated with dra-
matic shifts in gender roles26 that might influence risk for dis-
order. In addition, evidence suggests that differences in mental
health associated with migration are larger for women than for
men27 and tend to decrease with age.28 Multiple imputation was
used to include the small number of immigrants with missing
data on age at migration. All analyses were conducted using
SUDAAN software29 to adjust standard errors for the complex
sample designs of the surveys. Coefficients from multivariable
logistic regression equations are presented in exponentiated form
as covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs).
RESULTS
The sample included 2519 nonmigrant family members
of migrants in Mexico and 554 Mexican migrants in the
United States. Migrants were more likely to be male and
in the middle age groups (26-35 and 36-45 years) than
were family members of migrants (Table 1).
We compared the lifetime prevalence of disorders be-
tween the Mexican migrants in the United States and the
reference group (Table 2). Compared with nonmigrant
family members of migrants in Mexico, Mexican migrants
intheUnitedStateshadasignificantlyhigherlifetimepreva-
lence of any depressive or anxiety disorder (17.4% vs
11.7%),fordepressivedisordersasagroup(11.0%vs8.2%),
and for anxiety disorders as a group (10.1% vs 6.2%).
Among the 4 specific anxiety disorders assessed, migrants
had a higher prevalence for every type of disorder, and this
difference reached statistical significance for GAD (2.9%
vs 1.4%) and social phobia (5.2% vs 3.2%).
Results of the discrete time survival analysis show that,
during the years after arrival in the United States, mi-
grants were at significantly higher risk for first onset of
any depressive or anxiety disorder than were nonmi-
grant family members of migrants (OR, 1.42; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.94) after adjustment for age
and sex (Table 3). After adjustment for previous mood
and anxiety disorders, ORs associated with all disorder
categories were greater than 1.00, indicating a higher risk
after immigration, and reached statistical significance for
any anxiety disorder (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.12-2.83), GAD
(2.39; 1.36-4.21), and social phobia (2.16; 1.27-3.68).
Variation in the association between migration and risk
for any depressive or anxiety disorder across subgroups
was examined by testing statistical interactions in the dis-
crete time survival models, adjusting for covariates. Sta-
tistical interactions between migration and sex, birth co-
hort (age at interview, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, or 46 years)
and age at migration (13 vs 13 years) were tested.
Of these, only the interaction between birth cohort and
migration reached statistical significance.
As shown in Table 4, the elevated risk among mi-
grants occurred almost entirely in the 2 most recent birth
cohorts (those aged 18-25 and 26-35 years at the time of
interview). Risk for depressive and anxiety disorders af-
ter migration was highest (relative to nonmigrant fam-
ily members of migrants) among members of the most
recent cohort (those aged 18-25 years). In that group,
the OR for any depressive disorder was 4.37 (compared
with 1.16 overall), and the OR for anxiety disorder was
3.40 (compared with 1.78 overall). Of the 6 ORs in the
older cohorts (those aged 36-45 and 46 years), none
reached statistical significance and 4 were less than 1.00.
COMMENT
This study is unique among studies of migration and risk
for psychiatric disorders in the use of cross-national data
to compare morbidity in a representative sample of mi-
grants with that in their source population. Respondents
on both sides of the border were interviewed within the
same time frame using the same diagnostic interview. Al-
though the early pilot study11 included only a small sample
of English-speaking migrants, the present study includes
a larger sample of migrants interviewed in their choice of
English or Spanish. In addition, the comparison group in
this study--members of families in Mexico with a mi-
grant in the United States--provides a robust adjustment
for migrant selection. The finding that migrants are at
higher risk for onset of depressive and anxiety disorders
after migration compared with family members of mi-
grants who remained in Mexico provides the first direct
evidence that experiences as a migrant might lead to the
onset of clinically significant mental health problems in
this population. In particular, migrants were at higher risk
for depressive disorders, inclusive of major depression and
dysthymia, GAD, and social phobia. In addition, when the

relatively small increase in risk across the entire immi-
grant population (OR, 1.42) was broken down by birth
cohorts, a much larger effect was revealed among a re-
stricted segment of the population, those in the most re-
cent birth cohorts, with the strongest association found
in those aged 18 to 25 years (OR, 3.89).
This evidence is particularly important because find-
ings from previous studies6,9,30,31 that have been cited as
evidence of an adverse effect of migration on mental health
are open to alternative explanations. First, previous stud-
ies reported associations between poor mental health and
acculturation, that is, the extent to which immigrants or
members of ethnic minority populations have adopted
behaviors typical of mainstream Americans or gained pro-
ficiency in English, when both are assessed contempo-
raneously.6,30 This association is purported to reflect, in
part, the impact of negative experiences faced by immi-
grants in the process of assimilation (ie, acculturative
stressors). However, these findings can be explained by
high levels of risk for psychiatric disorder among the US-
born members of ethnic minority populations, who have
high risk for psychiatric disorders and high levels of ac-
culturation relative to immigrants.9,31
Second, a previous study8 found that immigrants who
have lived in the United States for longer periods have a
higher risk for psychiatric disorder than do immigrants
who have recently arrived. That finding seems to indi-
cate that a longer period of exposure to the United States
leads to a decline in mental health. However, the asso-
ciation between duration of residence and onset of dis-
order is confounded by age at migration; by holding age
constant, immigrants who have lived in the United States
longer migrated at younger ages. Recent studies32 have
found that immigrants who arrive in the United States
before 13 years of age have a much higher risk for mood
and anxiety disorders than do immigrants who arrive as
adolescents or adults. The apparent effect of longer du-
ration of residence in the United States may reflect the
high levels of risk among immigrants who arrived as chil-
dren, who, compared with other immigrants of the same
age, are likely to have lived in the United States longer.
The difference might be in age at migration rather than
duration of residence in the United States.

occur at the family level (ie, by differences between fami-
lies with and without migrants) or at the individual level
(ie, by differences between migrants and nonmigrants
within families). Restriction of the control group to non-
migrant members of families of migrants in Mexico was
intended to account for confounding at the family level.
Differences between migrants and nonmigrants within
families were accounted for in this study by treating the
exposure (migration) as a time-varying covariate; disor-
ders that preceded migration, including those occurring
in the year of migration, were counted toward the base-
line risk among nonmigrants. In addition, estimates were
adjusted for previous comorbid psychiatric disorders,
which might have occurred before or after migration.
Nonetheless, the possibility of residual confounding can-
not be ruled out entirely. In supplementary analyses of
this subsample conducted to address the question of mi-
grantselection,migrationremainedassociatedwithhigher
risk for onset of depressive and anxiety disorders after
adjustment for childhood adversity profiles.
Reliance on recall of the lifetime occurrence of psychi-
atric disorders is also a potential limitation of this study.36
Inaccuracy in recall would bias the results if migrants were
more likely than family members who remained in Mexico
to recall past symptoms. The potential influence of recall
bias should be considered in light of the observed interco-
hortvariationintheassociationbetweenmigrationandrisk
for disorder. We would expect recall bias to be more se-
vere in older cohorts because they are asked to recall psy-
chiatric symptoms over a longer period. However, in this
study the association between migration and disorder was
strongest in the youngest respondents, among whom the
influence of recall bias is likely to be minimized.
Finally, the differences observed herein may also re-
flect differences in idiom of distress between migrants and
their families of origin. These differences are minimized
in this study by the use of the same fully structured diag-
nostic interview, which assesses specific symptoms rather
than general complaints, and by the shared Mexican cul-
tural background of the entire sample. Future studies of
shifts in idiom of distress among migrants might further
test whether the apparent impact of migration on mental
health can be accounted for by methodological difficul-
ties in assessing psychiatric disorders cross-culturally.
Thisstudyadvancesourknowledgeofthetransitionin
population levels of risk for depressive and anxiety disor-
ders from the relatively low prevalence found in Mexico13
to the relatively high prevalence found in the population
ofMexicanoriginintheUnitedStates.37 Evidencenowsug-

hood in the United States are at roughly equally high lev-
els of lifetime risk as the general US-born population.32
Identifying these components of the transition in risk
forpsychiatricdisorderassociatedwithmigrationmayhelp
identify and test suspected etiological factors. Studies of
migrationandmentalhealthhavefocusedattentionondis-
crimination as one likely cause of increased risk for psy-
chiatric disorder. Studies of Caribbean-origin migrants in
Europe suggest associations between discrimination and
psychotic disorders.39,40 In the United States, there is evi-
dence of an association between experiences of discrimi-
nation and depression among Hispanic migrants.41,42 Al-
though suggestive, current evidence is limited to studies
thatcomparemigrantswithdescendantsofimmigrantsborn
in the host country. In addition, associations between mi-
gration and mental health may not be generalizable across
migrant groups, which differ dramatically in the factors
influencing migration and the conditions in the receiving
host country.
Potential explanations for the intercohort variation in
the effect of migration may lie in change in the composi-
tion of migrants across birth cohorts or in changes in the
socialcontextofimmigrantabsorptionintheUnitedStates.
Historical studies of migration from Mexico to the United
States have found that the demographic composition of the
migrant population has been relatively stable during the
periods covered in this study.43 Therefore, it is unlikely that
secular changes in the types of migrants account for the
observed variation in the effect of migration. Changes in
the context of immigrant absorption in the United States
havealsooccurredduringthisperiodthatwouldlikelyaffect
theexperienceofrecentbirthcohorts,mostnotablytheim-
migration reforms of 1965 and 1986. The finding that el-
evation in risk for depressive and anxiety disorders occurs
among recent birth cohorts of Mexican migrants may help
guide future research by locating the effect of migration
within the particular experiences of this subpopulation.

model. Models for categories other than any depressive or anxiety disorder included a time-varying indicator for prior onset of disorders not included in the
category being examined. Birth cohorts are defined by age at interview. Values in boldface are statistically significant at the P=.05 level.
