Abstract
Understanding attitudes toward suicide, especially among healthcare personnel, is an important step in both suicide prevention
and treatment. We document the adaptation process and establish the validity and reliability of the Attitudes Toward Suicide
(ATTS) questionnaire among 262 healthcare personnel in 2 major public hospitals in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. The findings
indicate that healthcare personnel in Malaysia have unique constructs on suicide attitude, compared with the original study
on a Western European sample. The adapted Malay ATTS questionnaire demonstrates adequate reliability and validity for
use among healthcare personnel in Malaysia.

Introduction
Globally, an estimated 804 000 individuals died by suicide in
a year,1 of which 60% occurred in Asia.2 Suicide is a rising
problem in Malaysia, with a 60% rise in suicide cases during
the last 45 years.3 Suicide is also a significant issue among
adolescents, with 12.6% reporting severe suicide ideation.4
The suicide rate in Malaysia is estimated to be between 1.185
and 86 per 100 000 population. However, the concern is that
these reported rates may be higher due to underreporting and
misclassification as undetermined deaths.7,8
In a health care context, approximately half of the indi-
viduals who suicided contacted the hospital emergency
department at least once within the year of their death,9 or
received health service care within 4 weeks of their death, of
which 20% were considered preventable.10 The number of
hospital admissions for suicide attempts in Malaysia is
increasing.11 Meanwhile, one-fifth of suicide deaths occurred
in Malaysian hospitals.4 However, a systematic review
revealed that general hospital personnel, in the United
Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, held negative atti-
tudes toward suicidal patients.12 Meanwhile, other studies,
including a worldwide systematic review from the patients'
perspective, indicated a perception that healthcare personnel
were nonempathetic and exhibited stigmatizing behavior.13,14
This could hinder help-seeking behavior among at-risk
suicidal individuals.15 Considering the importance of suicide
prevention and management in a health care setting,16,17 and
because suicide attitude is influenced by culture,18,19 it is cru-
cial to adapt and validate a Malaysian suicide attitude
questionnaire.
A literature search was conducted to determine the most
suitable questionnaire for cross-cultural adaptation and vali-
dation in Malaysia (see the "Methods" section for the descrip-
tion of the Attitudes Toward Suicide [ATTS] questionnaire).
This study adopted the ATTS questionnaire, as it was consid-
ered a valid and feasible instrument during a systematic
review by Kodaka et al,20 was built on existing question-
naires,21-23 and informed by expert knowledge in this field.24
Furthermore, it was employed in the health care setting25-28
and the Asian context.29-34

2 INQUIRY
The aim of this study was to translate, adapt, and assess
the validity and reliability of the ATTS questionnaire for use
among healthcare personnel in a Malaysian context.
Methods
Study Design
This is a cross-sectional study of healthcare personnel, from
2 major public hospitals in Malaysia, to establish the validity
and reliability of the Malay ATTS.
Phase I: Translation and Cross-Cultural
Adaptation Process
TheATTS questionnaire was developed by Salander Renberg
and Jacobsson,24 who aimed to build a feasible instrument
that enabled a large-scale measurement of attitudes toward
suicide. The second version of the ATTS questionnaire
is composed of 37 items, scored on a 5-point Likert
scale incorporating "Strongly Disagree," "Disagree,"
"Undecided," "Agree," and "StronglyAgree." The responses
were coded as "Strongly Disagree" = 1 to "Strongly Agree"
= 5, except for items 4 and 6, which were reverse coded. An
exploratory factor analysis revealed 10 interpretable factors
asSuicideasaright;Incomprehensibility;Noncommunication;
Preventability; Tabooing; Normal/common; Suicidal pro-
cess; Relation-caused; Preparedness to prevent; and
Resignation. Higher scores indicated agreement with the fac-
tor or domain. The  coefficients ranged from 0.38 to 0.86.
The English ATTS questionnaire was forward- and
backward-translated from English to Malay independently
by subject-matter and linguistic experts. The subject-matter
experts were a public health specialist (forward translation)
and a psychiatrist (backward translation). To ensure content
validity, a harmonization meeting was held to combine the
2 versions of the translated questionnaire, comprising of a
multidisciplinary team of psychiatric, psychological,
behavioral science, public health, and linguistic experts.
The adaptation process took into account factors of barriers
in linguistics comprehension, contextualized meaning
attached to a construct, and possible interpretations of the
translated instrument.35
Two pilot studies were conducted on the translated
instrument. Through a convenience sampling from 2 pub-
lic hospitals, the authors recruited 51 and 49 healthcare
personnel for each pilot study, respectively. After review-
ing the results of the first pilot study, improvements were
made to items with low corrected item-total correlation,
which contributed to the low total Cronbach's . A second
pilot study was implemented to test the improved ques-
tionnaire, and, compared with the first version of the trans-
lated questionnaire, yielded a higher total Cronbach's  of
0.53. The Malay ATTS questionnaire was finalized for fur-
ther validation with a larger sample.
Phase II: Validation Process
Participants.To validate a questionnaire, between 2 and 20
participants per item are needed,36,37 with a minimum of 250
participants.38 In this study, assuming that 8 participants are
needed per item, with a drop-out rate of 10%, 325 partici-
pants were targeted for recruitment.
For inclusion criteria, the following core medical and sur-
gical departments were selected: general medical, general
surgery, accident and emergency, obstetrics and gynecology,
pediatrics, orthopedics, and psychiatry. Doctors, nurses,
assistant medical officers, and medical attendant professions
were included. All participants were Malaysians, but trainees
were excluded from the study.
Procedures.Participants were randomly sampled based on
the sampling frame with the names of all staff from the
related professions and departments. Participation was vol-
untary, and strict confidentiality was maintained with no
identifier being used in the questionnaires. After giving
informed consent, participants filled out the questionnaire,
consisting of the Malay ATTS and demographic information,
such as age, gender, race, religion, marital status, occupation,
education, department, years of service, number of suicidal
patients cared for, and training in the management of suicidal
patients. The participants returned the questionnaires within
a week, sealed in an envelope.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using
the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; version
23) and the Analysis of Model Structures (AMOS; version
20). Confirmatory factor analyses, involving principal com-
ponents analysis (PCA) extraction and promax rotation, were
used to assess the construct validity of the MalayATTS ques-
tionnaire. Ten- and 11-factor models were tested based on the
findings of past validation studies.24,29 Items with a <0.40
factor loading were excluded from further analysis.
Model fit indices were employed in a confirmatory fac-
tor analysis. This included chi-square-value/degree of
freedom (2/df < 2.00),39 normed fit index (NFI  0.95),40
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI  0.95),40 parsimonious normed
fit index (PNFI  0.50),41 root mean square error of approx-
imation (RMSEA < 0.05),42 and test of RMSEA signifi-
cance (PCLOSE  0.05).
Cronbach's  (0.70)43,44 was employed to assess the
overall internal consistency of the scale and its subscales.
Items that contributed to low  coefficients were excluded
from further analysis.
Approvals. This research obtained ethical approval from the
Medical Research and Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health
Malaysia (NMRR-14-1805-22032) and the Research Ethics
Committee, National University of Malaysia (NN-035-
2015). The authors complied with the required ethical stan-
dards (see Figure 1).45

Results
Participant Characteristics
There were 325 randomly selected participants. The final
sample size for this validation was 262 participants (80.6%),
with 26 (8.0%) dropouts and 37 (11.4%) excluded listwise
due to missing data. The researchers did not rectify incom-
plete samples, due to confidentiality and the absence of
identifiers in the responses. Participants' demographics are
listed in Table 1.
Validity Analysis
The minimum amount of data required for factor analysis
was met, with more than 7 cases per questionnaire item.
Factorization, through the use of PCA using promax rotation,
revealed an acceptable Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sam-
pling adequacy (KMO = 0.73), which is above the recom-
mended value of 0.60. Bartlett's test of sphericity was
significant, 2(666) = 2210.97, P < .001. The diagonals of the
anti-image correlation matrix of all items were above 0.50,
thus supporting the inclusion of each item in the factor analy-
sis. In addition, the communalities for all items were above
0.40 (see Table 2), suggesting reasonable factorability. Given
these overall indicators, factor analysis was performed on all
37 items of the Malay ATTS questionnaire.
PCA examined the solutions for 10 and 11 factors using
promax rotation. The initial 11-factor solution was preferred,
as it explained a higher percentage of cumulative variance
(57.55%) compared with the 10-factor solution (54.63%),
and more items with insufficient primary loadings (>0.40)
were found for the 10-factor solution.

4 INQUIRY
PCA was conducted again on the 11-factor solution using
promax rotation after eliminating 7 items from further
analysis due to (1) primary factor loadings of less than 0.40
(items 24, 30, and 37) and (2) contribution to low  coeffi-
cient in the subfactors (items 4, 6, 22, and 35). The results
revealed that the 11 factors explained 63.24% of the variance.
All items had primary loadings above 0.40 (see Table 2).
Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the
model fit for the 11-factor solution, and compare it with the
10-factor solution. The results demonstrate that both models
met the fit values with a 2/df ratio (1.79 and 1.58, respec-
tively) and PCLOSE (0.39; 0.92) indices. The 11-factor
model also demonstrated a goodness-of-fit according to the
RMSEA (0.04) and PNFI (0.53) indices. However, it failed
to meet the cutoff values required for NFI and TLI indices
(see Table 3).
Reliability Analysis
The Cronbach's  for the domains ranged from 0.32 to
0.76. The overall Cronbach's  for the adapted Malay
ATTS questionnaire was 0.72 (see Table 4), thus indicating
that these items measured the same construct or content.46
Descriptive analysis of the questionnaire's items and fac-
tors is shown in Table 4. The least endorsed item was
"People do have the right to take their own lives," while
the most endorsed item was "It is a human duty to try to
stop someone from committing suicide." Items 7, 10, 11,
12, 15, 23, 32, and 33 had more than 20% of the respon-
dents choosing the "Undecided" option.
Discussion
The study findings demonstrate that healthcare personnel
may have different categorical constructs on suicide com-
pared with previously tested populations.24,29,33,47 It also sets
a milestone in the development of a suicide attitude question-
naire in Malaysia.
In terms of its validity, the item loadings of the adapted
11-factor Malay ATTS questionnaire varied widely from pre-
vious studies. Constructs in the adapted Malay ATTS ques-
tionnaire suggest a distinctive health care viewpoint on
suicide attitude, when compared with studies tested on a
Western European general population,24 and college students
in Asia 29,33 and Uganda.47 For example, the items "People
who make suicidal threats seldom complete suicide" and
"Those who talk about suicide will not do it" were grouped
under the "Common/Normal" factor in the original ATTS
questionnaire, but emerged as a distinctive factor in the
adapted Malay ATTS questionnaire under "Believability of
Suicide Threats." This may reflect on the experience and
decisions that healthcare personnel need to undertake when
encountering suicidal patients, compared with the general
population. The factors "Acceptability of Assisted Suicide,"
"The Nature of Suicidal Ideation," and "Duty to Prevent and
Mental Illness" also emerged to indicate issues that surround
the health care establishment.

Table 2.(continued)
Cultural and religious differences may contribute to the
factor loading patterns of the adapted Malay ATTS question-
naire items. The factor "Loneliness and Avoidance" may be
indicative of isolation and the taboo surrounding suicide in
Malaysia, especially among Muslims,33,34 who comprised
themajorityofrespondents.Thefactor"AbilitytoUnderstand
and Accept Suicide" in the adapted Malay ATTS question-
naire merged items from the "Resignation" and "Right to
Suicide" factors in the original ATTS questionnaire. This
may indicate that those who disagreed with the right to sui-
cide could also be less understanding toward suicidal
patients'reasons for wanting to die. Further explorations into
the right-to-die issue are important, as healthcare personnel
who expressed a permissive right-to-die attitude reported
less competency in suicide-related interventions48 and were
associated with personal factors, such as suicide ideation his-
tory25 and lower/nonendorsement of a religious belief.49,50
Confirmatory factor analysis yielded mixed findings,
where requirements for absolute fit indices, such as 2/df,
RMSEA, and PCLOSE, were met, but the cutoff values rec-
ommended for relative fit indices, such as TLI and NFI, were
not. This may be due to the relatively large number of
variables51 resulting in poor fit values. The multidimensional
nature of suicide attitudes24 may also contribute to this.
In terms of reliability analysis, the adapted questionnaire
demonstrated an acceptable overall Cronbach's  of more
than 0.70, thus indicating the internal reliability of the instru-
ment. When compared with Salander Renberg and
Jacobsson24 and Ji et al,29 the Cronbach's  value was slightly
higher. However, there was a large variation in the internal
consistency of factors, ranging from 0.32 to 0.76. This varia-
tion also surfaced in other suicide attitude instruments (e.g.,
 coefficient range of 0.26-0.83 in Domino et al,52 0.48-0.85
in Rogers and DeShon,53 0.38-0.86 in Salander Renberg and
Jacobsson,24 0.57-0.74 in Xiang et al,33 and 0.31-0.78 in Ji
et al29), suggesting that attitude toward suicide could be a
highly sensitive issue resulting in conflicting and varied
responses from participants,24 especially in a cultural setting
where suicide is stigmatized.47
Finally, analysis of response proportions to each item
revealed that 8 items consisted of at least one-fifth of the
participants choosing the "Undecided" option. Response
fatigue, or low motivation, could be ruled out as the reason,
because the position of these items ranged from the
Siau et al 7
beginning, middle, and end of the questionnaire.54 Perhaps
healthcare personnel in this study felt a lack of knowledge or
information to assess the believability level of a suicidal
patient's communication (items 12 and 33) and the private
nature of suicidal thoughts (items 7, 10, 11, and 15), and
experienced a conflict between sympathizing with a termi-
nally ill patient's wish to die and disagreement with the right
to die (item 32), or were ambivalent about suicide as a taboo
topic for discussion (item 23).
Strengths and Limitations
As the first study in Malaysia to cross-culturally adapt and
validate a suicide attitude questionnaire, this study demon-
strated methodological vigor by employing random sam-
pling to ensure representativeness of the data. Participants'
heterogeneity was also achieved, as is attested by the partici-
pants' age range, department, occupation, and experience in
the health care sector and in handling suicidal patients.As for
its limitations, the drop-out rate and missing data could have
contributed to the response bias, which was not examined.
Nearly half of the respondents were inexperienced in manag-
ing suicidal patients; therefore, their attitudes may not be
shaped by concrete encounters with suicidal individuals.
However, we still consider their responses to be valid, as atti-
tudes could constitute preconceived ideas, which may or
may not be modified by experience. This study focused on
healthcare personnel from 2 general hospitals, while provid-
ers from community and private settings were not repre-
sented. Future studies employing different settings and target
groups are needed to further explore and improve the psy-
chometric rigor of the adapted MalayATTS questionnaire, so
that comparisons can be made.
Conclusion
The adapted Malay ATTS questionnaire demonstrated ade-
quate psychometric properties for use among healthcare
