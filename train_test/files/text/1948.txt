We examined age and control belief differences in physical and emotional reactivity to daily stressors in four
domains: interpersonal, work, network, and home. We combined data from the National Study of Daily
Experiences and the Midlife in the United States survey, resulting in 1,031 participants who reported on 7,229
days. Findings from multilevel models suggest that age and control beliefs play an important role in a person's
reactivity to interpersonal, network, and work stressors. Specifically, older age and lower perceived constraints
were each related to lower emotional and physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors. High mastery buffered the
physical effects of work stressors for younger and older adults, and high mastery was important for middle-aged
adults' emotional reactivity to network stressors. High constraint was associated with the strongest physical
reactivity to network stressors for younger and older adults.
THE present study focuses on age differences in reactivity
to multiple domains of daily stressors. We assert that age
plays a vital role in determining the psychological and physical
consequences of daily stressors (i.e., reactivity). Although
some studies have examined age differences in exposure
(e.g., Almeida & Horn, 2004) and reactivity to specific stressor
domains (e.g., interpersonal; Birditt, Fingerman, & Almeida,
2005), to date no single study has included multiple stressor
domains to capture a comprehensive account of age differences
in daily stress processes. To this end, we examine age dif-
ferences in emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors.
We define emotional reactivity as an increase in negative affect
and physical reactivity as an increase in physical symptom
reports in response to stressors. We examine this reactivity in
the stressor domains most often reported by people of all
ages: interpersonal, home, work, and network (stressors that
happen to close friends or family members; see Almeida &
Horn). These domains represent areas where people often
derive personal meaning, and they may be particularly im-
portant for shifting motivational goals across the adult life
span. In addition to studying characteristics of the situation,
we also examined how personal control beliefs are involved in
this process.
Effects of Daily Stressors
Daily stressors are the routine challenges of day-to-day
living, and although they may be relatively minor, they are
tangible events that can have immediate negative impacts on
physical and psychological well-being (Almeida, 2005;
Almeida, Wethington, & Kessler, 2002; Bolger, DeLongis,
Kessler, & Schilling, 1989). Daily stressors affect well-being
not only by having separate, immediate, and direct effects on
emotional and physical functioning, but also by piling up over
a series of days to create persistent irritations and overloads that
may result in more serious stress reactions such as anxiety and
depression (Lazarus, 1999; Zautra, 2003). Some stressors are
unhealthier than others, and some individuals are more prone
than other individuals to the effects of stressors (Almeida). In
the present study we explore domains of daily stressors and
characteristics of individuals to examine for whom and under
what circumstances reactivity to stressors would be buffered or
exacerbated. Specifically, we examine age differences and
perceptions of control as personal characteristics that may be
important for reactivity to commonly experienced daily
stressors. Control is associated with decreased reactivity to
stressors (Ong, Bergeman, & Bisconti, 2005) and therefore
should be considered within the context of emotional and
physical reactivity. Furthermore, stressor domains may vary in
their salience across adulthood (e.g., Clark-Plaskie & Lachman,
1999), so the emotional and physical impact of those stressors
could be associated with age. For example, older age has been
associated with decreased emotional reactivity to interpersonal
stressors (Birditt et al., 2005), and self-determination theory
(Deci & Ryan, 1980, 2000) suggests that older adults are able to
pursue their valued outcomes (e.g., maintaining interpersonal
relationships) even when faced with constraints.
Age Differences in Reactivity to Stressors
Some researchers suggest that older adults are less
emotionally reactive to stressors than younger adults are (e.g.,
Uchino, Berg, Smith, Pearce, & Skinner, 2006). Certain life-
span theories of emotion regulation are also consistent with
the idea of lessened emotional reactivity to stress with age
(Carstensen, 1995; Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999;
Labouvie-Vief & DeVoe, 1991; Lang, Staudinger, & Carsten-
sen, 1998). For example, socioemotional selectivity theory
(Carstensen et al.) posits better regulation of emotion among
older adults, and better emotion regulation is a key aspect of
optimal aging (Baltes & Baltes, 1990; Baltes, Lindenberger, &
Staudinger, 1998; Heckhausen & Schulz, 1995; Magai, 2001).
Birditt and colleagues (2005) found that older adults were less
emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors; we examine
whether this pattern extrapolates to home-based stressors, work
stressors, and stressors stemming from one's social network.

Age differences in physical reactivity to specific daily
stressor domains remain unexplored. Some research suggests
that specific stressors (i.e., occupational or work-related
stressors) occurring on a daily basis are associated with lower
levels of physical well-being (e.g., Hahn, 2000; Repetti, 1993).
Given that physical symptoms and illness are consistently
found to increase with age (House et al., 1994; Rowe & Kahn,
1987), a consideration of the role of age is even more critical
when the type of distress under investigation is physical distress
(Ensel & Lin, 2000).
Stressor Domain: Interpersonal, Work, Home, and
Network Stressors
Previous studies have examined commonly reported stressors
such as interpersonal stressors (e.g., Birditt et al., 2005), work
stressors (Grzywacz, Almeida, & McDonald, 2002; Hahn,
2000), home stressors (Almeida, Wethington, & Chandler,
1999; Serido, Almeida, & Wethington, 2004), and network
stressors (e.g., Almeida et al., 2002; Zautra, Finch, Reich, &
Guarnaccia, 1991). However, to our knowledge, only the study
by Birditt and associates examined age differences in reactivity.
We expand on this work by examining whether age-related
decreases in reactivity to interpersonal stressors extend to other
domains of stressors.
Age differences for interpersonal problems are particularly
germane when one is examining minor stressors encountered
in daily life, where the majority of daily stressors involve
interpersonal conflicts (Almeida, 2005). Although older adults
report fewer arguments than do younger adults (Birditt et al.,
2005), interpersonal conflicts are detrimental to an individuals'
psychological (Rook, 1984; Sherman, 2003) and physical
(Kiecolt-Glaser, 1999) functioning, regardless of age. Despite
the fact that interpersonal stressors are important to well-being,
however, older adults are less emotionally reactive to them than
younger and middle-aged adults are (Birditt et al.).
Work-related stressors are also an important domain because
they are linked with increased health problems (e.g., Chandola,
Brunner, & Marmot, 2006) and poorer emotional health (e.g.,
Pflanz & Sonnek, 2002). The importance of the work domain
typically increases in midlife, especially for men (Clark-Plaskie &
Lachman, 1999). Therefore, this domain is particularly im-
portant to examine from an adult life-span perspective because
of the shift in saliency in work that often accompanies aging;
that is, work stressors could be particularly detrimental for
people in midlife.
Network stressors may reveal different age-related patterns in
reactivity than other stressors. For example, under some social
situations, older adults experience greater heart-rate reactivity
than younger adults do (Uchino, Holt-Lunstad, Uno, &
Flinders, 2001). In the present study we examine whether
these age differences are similar for emotional and physical
reactivity to daily network stressors. Home stressors are also
important to consider because they have been linked with in-
creased anxiety (Evans & Steptoe, 2002) and tension (Almeida
et al., 1999). Almeida and Horn (2004) found that younger
and middle-aged adults reported more demands in the home
than did older adults. We extend this finding by examining
whether reactivity to home stressors differed by age.
The Importance of Personal Control for
Age Differences in Reactivity
Greater personal control is related to reduced reactivity to
stressors in daily life (e.g., Ong et al., 2005). We examine
whether potential age differences in emotional and physical
reactivity to interpersonal, network, home, and work stressors
depend on perceptions of personal control. As goals shift in
different domains for younger, middle-aged, and older adults,
beliefs regarding control can be salient for reactivity to stressors
in valued domains. The two control beliefs that we include in
the present study are mastery and constraint. Mastery is often
described in terms of one's judgments about his or her ability to
achieve a goal, whereas perceived constraint refers to the extent
to which a person believes factors exist that interfere with her or
his goal attainment (Lachman & Weaver, 1998b). Personal
mastery is an important psychological resource that mitigates
the effects of stress and strain (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978).
When a person is faced with stressful situations, a strong sense
of control has also been linked to low levels of self-reported
perceived stress (Cameron, Armstrong-Stassen, Orr, & Loukas,
1991) and lower risk of depression (Yates, Tennstedt, & Chang,
1999). Higher levels of perceived control also buffered recently
bereaved wives from anxiety when they were faced with daily
stressors (Ong et al.).
We were interested in examining both mastery and con-
straint in the present study because they could be differentially
important across the adult life span. For example, as younger
adults are striving toward goals in their work lives, a sense
of mastery may be particularly important. Because midlife re-
presents a time where work status and expertise may be at its
peak (Clark-Plaskie & Lachman, 1999) and differences in sense
of control within the work domain exist between young and
middle-aged adults as a function of progress along the career
path at different stages in the life course (Heise, 1990), we
examined whether control beliefs would be particularly
important for middle-aged adults' well-being in response to
work stressors. On the basis of prior research findings and
socioemotional selectivity theory that younger adults who are
invested in establishing interpersonal relationships more often
employ active problem-solving strategies to their daily inter-
personal problems than older adults do, we predicted that
perceived control (both constraints and mastery) would have
a stronger relationship with well-being (both emotional and
physical) among younger adults than among older adults. For
this reason, we are extending findings first reported by Birditt
and colleagues (2005) to examine how control may influence
these age differences. Lastly, we explore potential interactions
between control and age for stressors pertaining to the home
and to those from the social network, domains that are not
related to one specific age group.
The Present Study
We examined reactivity to daily interpersonal, network,
home, and work stressors for younger, middle-aged, and older
adults. We also examined whether reactivity differed on two
measures of perceived control: personal mastery and perceived
constraints. The daily diary design allowed for the examination
of emotions and symptoms of people of different ages and
different levels of control when a stressor actually happened

(Almeida & Kessler, 1998; Larsen, 1987). We hypothesized
that older age would be related to higher levels of daily
emotional well-being and to reduced emotional reactivity to
daily stressors. In addition, we hypothesized that higher levels
of personal mastery and lower levels of constraints would each
be related to higher levels of both daily emotional and physical
well-being as well as reduced reactivity in response to daily
stressors for people at all ages. We also suggested that the
strength of control beliefs on reactivity to stressors would vary
as a function of age, such that control beliefs would exert the
strongest influence for age groups in which the stressor domain
is particularly salient. For domains in which saliency may not
be systematically related to age (e.g., home and network), we
explored control belief differences in reactivity.
METHODS
Sample and Procedure
Data for the analyses are from the National Study of Daily
Experiences (NSDE). Respondents were 1,031 adults (562
women, 469 men), all of whom had previously participated in
the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS), a nationally
representative telephone-mail survey of 3,032 people, aged 25­
74 years, carried out in 1995­1996 under the auspices of the
MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Successful Mid-
life Development (for descriptions of the MIDUS project, see
Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004; Keyes & Ryff, 1998; Lachman &
Weaver, 1998a; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998). We randomly
selected respondents in the NSDE from the MIDUS sample,
and they received $20 for their participation in the project.
Over eight consecutive evenings, respondents completed short
telephone interviews about their daily experiences. We planned
data collection to span an entire year (March 1996 to March
1997), so we used 40 separate ``flights'' of interviews, with
each flight representing the 8-day sequence of interviews from
approximately 38 respondents. We staggered the initiation of
flights across the day of the week to control for the possible
confounding between day of the study and day of week. Of
the 1,242 MIDUS respondents we attempted to contact, 1,031
agreed to participate, yielding a response rate of 83%.
Respondents completed an average of 7 of the 8 interviews,
resulting in a total of 7,229 daily interviews.
The NSDE subsample and the MIDUS sample had very
similar distributions for gender, age, education, and race. The
NSDE had slightly more women (54.5% vs 51.5% of the sam-
ples, respectively), was better educated (60.8% of the MIDUS
sample had 13 years or more of education, vs 62.3% of the
NSDE subsample), and had fewer minority respondents than
the MIDUS. Of the participants in the NSDE, 90.3% were
Caucasian, 5.9% were African American, and 3.8% were all
other races; in the MIDUS, 87.8% were Caucasian, 6.8% were
African American, and 4.4% were all other races. On average,
respondents for the present analysis were 47 years old. We
wanted to remain consistent with previous studies that have
examined age differences in stressor exposure (Almeida &
Horn, 2004) and reactivity (Birditt et al., 2005) for young,
middle-aged, and older adults with the NSDE. In addition, we
hypothesized that the effects of control would vary according to
specific age groups, whether young, middle-aged, or old, in the
life span. For these reasons, we divided individuals into the
following three groups (based on age at the time of the initial
MIDUS survey): young (25­39 years), middle-aged (40­59),
and old (60­74).
Measures
Daily physical symptoms. --We assessed daily symptoms by
using a shortened version of the symptoms checklist by Larsen
and Kasimatis (1991). We omitted items that overlapped with
the psychological distress scale (e.g., ``the urge to cry''). The
present scale assessed health symptoms in six categories: (a)
headaches, backaches, and muscle soreness; (b) cough, sore
throat, fever, chills, or other cold and flu symptoms; (c) nausea,
poor appetite, or other stomach problems; (d) chest pain or
dizziness; and (e) other physical symptoms or discomforts.
Each day, respondents indicated how frequently they experi-
enced each symptom over the past 24 hours on a 5-point scale
that ranged from none of the time to all of the time. We
computed summed scores across the six items for each day.
This scale has been used effectively in previous studies (e.g.,
Almeida et al., 2002; Charles & Almeida, 2006; Grzywacz,
Almeida, Neupert, & Ettner, 2004).
Daily psychological distress. --We measured daily psycho-
logical distress by using 10 items designed specifically for the
MIDUS. This scale was developed from the following well-
known and valid instruments: The Affect Balance Scale
(Bradburn, 1969), the University of Michigan's Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (Kessler et al., 1994), the
Manifest Anxiety Scale (Taylor, 1953), and the Center for
Epidemiological Studies­Depression scale (Radloff, 1977).
Respondents were asked questions such as these: How much
of the time today did you feel worthless; hopeless; nervous;
restless or fidgety; that everything was an effort; and so sad that
nothing could cheer you up? They rated their response on a
5-point scale ranging from none of the time to all of the time.
We summed scores across the 10 items for each day. This scale
has also demonstrated good reliability and validity in previous
studies (Kessler et al., 2002; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998).
Daily stressors. --We assessed daily stressors through the
semi-structured Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (Almeida
et al., 2002). The inventory consisted of a series of seven stem
questions asking whether certain types of daily stressors (i.e.,
arguments, potential arguments, work stressors, home stressors,
network stressors, discrimination stressors, and other stressors)
had occurred in the past 24 hours. For each daily interview,
individuals who responded affirmatively to the stem questions
received a value of one for the relevant stressor domain. We
assigned scores of zero to domains where no stressors were
experienced on that day. The present study utilized four stressor
domain variables: interpersonal stressors (whether an argument
or potential argument occurred; 44% of all stressors reported),
work stressors (whether anything happened at work that could
be stressful; 18% of all stressors reported), home stressors
(whether anything happened at home that could be stressful;
15% of all stressors reported), and network stressors (whether
anything happened to a close friend or family member that
turned out to be stressful for the respondent; 10% of all

P218
stressors reported). Interpersonal, work, home, and network
stressors represent 87% of all stressors reported. The remaining
13% of stressors included experiences of discrimination (1.2%)
and those not falling under any specific category (11.8%).
Control beliefs. --Researchers assessed control belief varia-
bles in the MIDUS survey. These measures were developed
from Pearlin and Schooler's (1978) mastery scale with five
additional items specifically designed for the MIDUS (Lach-
man & Weaver, 1998b). Respondents rated on a 7-point scale
(1 ¼ strongly agree, 7 ¼ strongly disagree) how strongly they
agreed with each statement. For the mastery scale, respondents
answered the following questions: (a) I can do just about
anything I really set my mind to; (b) when I really want to do
something, I usually find a way to succeed at it; (c) whether or
not I am able to get what I want is in my own hands; and (d)
what happens to me in the future depends mostly on me.
Researchers coded responses so higher scores indicated greater
personal mastery for each person (a ¼ 0.70). For the constraint
scale, respondents answered the following questions: (a) there
is really no way I can solve all the problems I have; (b) there is
little I can to do change the important things in my life; (c) I
often feel helpless in dealing with the problems in life; (d) other
people determine most of what I can and cannot do; (e) what
happens in my life is often beyond my control; (f) there are
many things that interfere with what I want to do; (g) I have
little control over the things that happen to me; and (h) I some-
times feel I am being pushed around in my life. Researchers
coded responses so higher scores indicated greater perceived
constraints for each person (a ¼ 0 .86). These measures have
been used successfully as valid indicators of personal mastery
and perceived constraint in several studies (e.g., Lachman &
Firth, 2004; Lachman & Weaver, 1998a, 1998b), and they were
associated with each other in the current study; r(1,021)¼À.44,
p , .001.
Covariates. --Because men and women tend to differ in their
average mood (Almeida & Kessler, 1998) and physical
symptom reports (Verbrugge, 1985), we controlled for gender
in all analyses. We further controlled for socioeconomic status
(using education as a proxy) because of the differential
emotional and physical reactivity to daily stressors found
previously in the literature (Grzywacz et al., 2004).
ANALYSES
We implemented multilevel modeling using SAS Proc
Mixed to examine emotional and physical reactivity to daily
stressors. In this framework, individual change or variability is
represented by a two-level hierarchical model (Hawkins, Guo,
Hill, Battin-Pearson, & Abbott, 2001). At Level 1, each
person's variability is expressed as an individual regression
equation that depends on a set of parameters (intercept and
slope). These individual parameters become the outcome
variables in a Level 2 model, where they may depend on some
person-level characteristics.
Multilevel modeling is frequently used to model intra-
individual variability (i.e., people's variability around their own
average). This technique was useful in the current study
because we examined interindividual differences (e.g., age and
control belief differences) in intraindividual covariation (e.g.,
the within-person relationship between stressors and psycho-
logical distress). For example, to examine age and constraint
differences in emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors,
we created dummy codes for middle-aged (40­59 years)
and older (60­74 years) adults. We formulated the following
model:
Level 1: Distressit

In Equation 1, the intercept (b0it
) is defined as the expected
level of psychological distress for person i on days when no in-
terpersonal stressors occurred (i.e., Interpersonal Stressor ¼ 0).
Slope b1it
is the expected change in psychological distress
associated with days when interpersonal stressors occur. Error
term rit
represents a unique effect associated with person i (i.e.,
fluctuation around the mean). Equation 2 includes gender and
education as covariates and tests for age and constraint
differences in the average level of psychological distress, with
the intercept c00
representing the average level of psychological
distress for younger women (Gender ¼ 0) with less than a high
school degree (Education ¼ 0) with average constraint levels
(control belief variables were centered around their grand
mean). Equation 3 tests for age and constraint differences in the
within-person association between interpersonal stressor expo-
sure and psychological distress, with intercept c10
representing
the average relationship between interpersonal stressors and
psychological distress for younger adults. Interindividual
fluctuations from the level and slope are represented by u0i
and u1i
, respectively.
RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations of the study
variables for each age group. Although there were no age
differences in levels of physical symptoms, younger adults
reported higher levels of psychological distress than middle-
aged and older adults did, and they reported higher levels of
personal mastery than middle-aged adults did. In contrast, older
adults had higher levels of perceived constraints than did
younger adults. Across all participants, interpersonal stressors
(21.44% of days) were the most frequently reported stressors,
followed by work stressors (9.36% of days), home stressors
(7.9% of days), and network stressors (5.52% of days). Younger
adults reported more frequent work stressors than did older
adults, and they also reported more frequent interpersonal and
home stressors than did middle-aged and older adults. There
were no age differences in the frequency of network stressors.
AGE DIFFERENCES IN REACTIVITY P219
Multilevel Models
Results from fully unconditional models indicated that 54%
of the variability in psychological distress was between people
(s00
¼ 7.22, z ¼ 19.42, p , .001), and 46% was within people
(r2 ¼ 6.23, z ¼ 55.35, p , .001). In addition, 55% of the
variability in physical symptoms was between people (s00
¼
2.84, z ¼ 20.03, p , .001) and 45% was within people (r2 ¼
2.36, z ¼ 55.60, p , .001). These models indicated that there
was sufficient variability in each outcome variable at each level,
which is necessary for further analyses (Nezlek, 2001;
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).
We conducted multilevel models to examine the hypotheses
that (a) older age would be related to higher levels of daily
emotional well-being and to reduced emotional reactivity to
daily stressors; (b) higher levels of personal mastery and lower
levels of constraints would each be related to higher levels of
both daily emotional and physical well-being; (c) higher levels
of personal mastery and lower levels of constraint would be
related to reduced reactivity in response to stressors for people
at all ages; and (d) perceived control (both constraint and
mastery) would have a stronger relationship with emotional and
physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors among younger
adults than among older adults. Models examining the afore-
mentioned questions are presented in Tables 2 through 5.
Across all models, older adults reported less psychological
distress than younger adults did (c04
). People with higher levels
of constraint reported more distress than did those with less
constraint (see Tables 2 and 4, c05
), and older adults were
different from the younger adults in the relationship between
constraint and distress (see Tables 2 and 4, c07
). Across all
models, women reported more physical health symptoms than
men, but there were no gender differences in psychological
distress. Education was negatively associated with physical
health symptoms and psychological distress.
Reactivity to interpersonal stressors. --In the first model in
Table 2, we examined age and constraint differences in
emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors. Findings indicate
that both middle-aged (c11
) and older (c12
) adults were
significantly less reactive than the young adults (c10
), that
people with higher levels of constraint were more reactive (c13
),
and that middle-aged (c14
) and older (c15
) adults were
significantly different from younger adults in their constraint
differences in reactivity. The age and constraint differences in
emotional reactivity to interpersonal stressors are presented in
Figure 1. This figure plots psychological distress on days when
an interpersonal stressor occurred and days when there were no
reported interpersonal stressors for individuals with high and
low levels of constraints. The pattern indicates that younger
adults with high levels of constraints were the most emotionally
reactive to interpersonal stressors (i.e., highest level of distress
on interpersonal stressor days). This model accounted for 38%
of the between-person variability and 13% of the within-person
variability in psychological distress, which are estimates of
a pseudo-R2 (Singer & Willett, 2003). (Note that we plotted all
figures by conducting additional models for individuals who
scored lower than 1 SD below the control belief mean,
identified as low constraint and low mastery, and higher than 1
SD above the control belief mean, identified as high constraint
and high mastery.)
The second model in Table 2 examined age and control be-
lief differences in physical reactivity to interpersonal stressors.

People with higher levels of constraint reported more physical
symptoms (c05
), but there were no age differences in the
average number of symptoms reported (c03,
c04
). The second
section of the model indicates that people with higher levels
of constraint were more physically reactive to interpersonal
stressors (c13
), and that middle-aged adults (c14
) were different from younger adults in their constraint differences in reactivity,
but older adults (c15
) were not different from younger adults
(see Figure 2). Figure 2 indicates that younger adults with
high constraints were the most physically reactive to inter-
personal stressors. This model accounted for 12% of the
between-person variability and 4% of the within-person vari-
ability in physical symptoms.
We also examined whether there were differences in daily
psychological distress and physical symptoms as a function of
mastery. For both emotional and physical reactivity, there were
no mastery differences in the responses to interpersonal
stressors across the adult life span.

AGE DIFFERENCES IN REACTIVITY P221
Reactivity to work stressors. --We examined the hypothesis
that control beliefs would be especially important for middle-
aged adults' reactivity to work stressors in Table 3. The first
model in Table 3 indicates that older adults reported less
distress than did younger adults (c04
), younger adults' distress
was more closely tied to mastery compared with that of middle-
aged adults (c06
), and people with higher mastery were less
emotionally reactive to work stressors than were those
individuals with less mastery (c13
). There were no age and
mastery differences in emotional reactivity to work stressors,
suggesting that high mastery was equally beneficial for
emotional reactivity to work stressors for all age groups.
This model accounted for 11% of the between-person vari-
ability and 5% of the within-person variability in psychological
distress.
The second model in Table 3 examined age and control
belief differences in physical reactivity to work stressors.
People with lower levels of mastery reported more physical
symptoms (c05
), but there were no age differences in the
average number of symptoms reported (c03,
c04
). The second
section of the model indicates that people with lower levels of
mastery were more physically reactive to work stressors (c13
),
middle-aged adults were less reactive to work stressors than
were younger adults (c11
), and that middle-aged adults (c14
)
were different from younger adults in their mastery differences
in reactivity (see Figure 3). Figure 3 indicates that on days
when respondents experienced work stressors, mastery buffered
physical reactivity to work stressors for younger and older but
not for middle-aged respondents. This model accounted for 5%
of the between-person variability and 3% of the within-person
variability in physical symptoms.
We also examined whether there were differences in
psychological distress and physical symptoms as a function
of constraint. For both emotional and physical reactivity, there
were no constraint differences in the responses to work
stressors across the adult life span.
Reactivity to home stressors. --Models conducted to examine
age and control differences in reactivity to home stressors
indicated that higher levels of mastery (c13
) and lower levels of
constraint (c13
) were each associated with lessened emotional
reactivity (see Table 4). These findings did not differ by age.
Neither mastery nor constraint was associated with physical
reactivity to home stressors, and there were no age differences
in those associations.
Reactivity to network stressors. --Models conducted to test
for age and control belief differences in reactivity to network
stressors are presented in Table 5. High mastery was more
beneficial for middle-aged adults' than younger adults'
emotional reactivity (c14
), but older adults' reactivity appears
to remain heightened even with high levels of mastery
(nonsignificant c15
indicates similar slope to younger adults;
see Table 5 and Figure 4). This model accounted for 10% of the
between-person and 6% of the within-person variability in
psychological distress. There were no age and constraint
differences in emotional reactivity, and there were no age or
mastery differences in physical reactivity. When examining the
role of constraint for physical reactivity to network stressors,
we found that a high level of constraint was associated with
increased reactivity (c13
). Similar to the pattern exhibited in
Figure 4, this finding was further qualified by age where lower
levels of constraint were more beneficial for middle-aged

adults' physical reactivity than younger adults' (c14
), and
younger adults with high levels of constraint exhibited the most
reactivity. This model accounted for 8% of the between-person
and 2% of the within-person variability in psychological
distress. In sum, these models indicate that control in midlife
is important for buffered reactivity to network stressors.
DISCUSSION
The current study examined age and control belief differ-
ences in reactivity to daily stressors at three different stages in
the adult life span. We incorporated the four most common
domains of daily stressors and examined whether there were
age differences in reactivity. By including stressors that may be
differentially salient across the life span (e.g., work stressors
in midlife), we also examined whether age differences in re-
activity to these stressors depended on perceptions of control.
We added gender and education as covariates in the models.
The education differences in both indicators of well-being as
well as the gender differences in physical health supported
previous work (e.g., Grzywacz et al., 2004; Verbrugge, 1985).
Age differences in reactivity. --As we predicted, middle-aged
and older adults evidenced a smaller increase in psychological
distress in response to interpersonal stressors than did younger
adults, and middle-aged adults were less physically reactive to
work stressors than were younger adults. These age patterns
are consistent with many studies in which older age is related
to reduced stressor reactivity (Birditt et al., 2005), reduced
duration of negative emotions (Carstensen, Pasupathi, Mayr, &
Nesselroade, 2000), and increased well-being (Charles,
Carstensen, & McFall, 2001; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998).
Preserved and even enhanced emotion regulation with age is
consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen,
1995; Carstensen, Fung, & Charles, 2003; Carstensen et al.,
1999), which posits that emotional goals become increasingly
important as people grow older, so resources could be directed
at buffering the negative emotional effects of stressors.
Enhanced emotion regulation could also be due to learning
through an accumulation of experiences, as well pursuing
valued outcomes (Deci & Ryan, 2000). In the present study, we
were interested to see if the emotion-regulation findings of
Birditt and colleagues and socioemotional selectivity theory
could be applied to stressors outside of the social domain. Our
findings suggest that there are no age differences in emotional
or physical reactivity to home or network stressors. Although
home and network stressors were both associated with an
increase in psychological distress and physical symptoms, this
increase was consistent across the adult life span. It is important
to note, however, that these domain-specific age differences in
reactivity for interpersonal, network, and work stressors were
further qualified by control beliefs.
Age, perceived constraints, and reactivity to interpersonal
and network stressors. --Consistent with previous work
(Cameron et al., 1991, Ong et al., 2005), control beliefs were
important for mitigating the negative effects of interpersonal
stressors. Although high levels of perceived constraints were
related to worse outcomes for people of all ages, this
relationship was stronger among younger adults than among
middle-aged and older adults. Younger adults who reported
high levels of perceived constraints reacted most strongly to
daily interpersonal stressors, reporting more psychological
distress and more physical symptoms on these days compared
with days when no interpersonal stressors occurred. Age
differences in life circumstances and life goals may partially
explain this finding. As suggested by socioemotional selectivity
theory, establishing relationships is an important goal for
younger adults, making this a salient area for stressors and
important for reactivity when control is perceived as low. This
theory also posits that older adults may be better at regulating
their responses to interpersonal stressors even in the face of
perceived constraints because of a focus on emotional goals and
awareness of reduced time left in life. High constraint was
detrimental for younger adults' physical symptoms when we
examined network stressors, but it was detrimental for older
adults' as well. Although network stressors are social in nature,
they encompass events other than arguments and disagreements
and may be particularly vulnerable to constraints for older
adults, who may experience more uncontrollable kinds of
stressors in their social networks (e.g., health-related stressors;
see Almeida et al., 2002). This finding also highlights the
suggestion by Ensel and Lin (2000) for researchers to examine
physical distress in addition to psychological distress, as the
patterns of reactivity are different.
Age, personal mastery, and reactivity to work and network
stressors. --High levels of personal mastery were associated
with reduced emotional and physical reactivity to work
stressors, but this relationship did not appear to hold for
middle-aged adults' physical reactivity; that is, middle-aged
adults exhibited heightened physical reactivity to work stressors
regardless of their level of mastery. This finding supports
previous research suggesting that the importance of the work
domain typically increases in midlife (Clark-Plaskie & Lach-
man, 1999). Because of the increased salience of work during
midlife, it is possible that stressors in this domain are
particularly threatening to middle-aged adults and that they
experience increased physical symptoms even if, as previous
research suggests (e.g., Heise, 1990), they report more control
over work than do younger adults. A high sense of global
mastery does not appear to be enough to counteract the negative
primary appraisal of work stressors. Primary appraising (e.g.,
Lazarus, 1999) involves the relevance of what is happening to
one's values, goal commitments, and beliefs about self and
world; whether an individual experiences distress as a result of
a stressor depends upon the appraisal of the situation. Previous
work suggests that work-specific control beliefs are important
for well-being (Elfering et al., 2005), but future research able to
map work-stressor-specific control beliefs could directly test if
certain aspects of control may be differentially important for
middle-aged adults' reactivity to work stressors.
High mastery was more beneficial for middle-aged adults'
emotional reactivity to network stressors than for younger or
middle-aged adults'. Because mastery can involve problem-
focused solutions and active goal striving (Lachman & Firth,
2004; Lachman & Weaver, 1998b), it is possible that middle-
aged adults may be called upon to assist with the stressors in
their social networks. For example, middle-aged adults may
provide care and support for aging parents and young children
AGE DIFFERENCES IN REACTIVITY P223
and need to solve problems stemming from both social roles
(e.g., Schlesinger, 1989), in which case a sense of mastery that
one can solve problems would be extremely beneficial to
combating the stressors. A high sense of control was not
beneficial for older adults' reactivity to network stressors, so
future research able to examine the specific sources of network
stressors and the age differences associated with them could
address whether the context, sense of control, or age of the
person is more important for reactivity. Future work in-
corporating measures of positive affect could examine whether
the patterns of emotional reactivity depend on valence.
Additionally, examining the perceived threat and severity of
the stressors could be an important step for future work, as
Almeida and Horn (2004) found some age differences in
stressor threat dimensions (danger and frustration) and sub-
jective severity ratings.
Conclusions
We found that middle-aged and older adults were less
physically and emotionally reactive to interpersonal stressors,
and, before we considered the role of perceived control, middle-
aged adults were less physically reactive to work stressors.
We also documented the salutary effects of low perceived
constraints and high personal mastery in buffering the
emotional and physical repercussions of daily interpersonal,
network, and work stressors. We further found that these
influences vary by age, such that low perceived control was
more detrimental for younger adults than it was for middle-aged
or older adults in the context of daily interpersonal stressors.
With respect to daily work stressors, low levels of mastery were
detrimental for all age groups, but adults in midlife were
physically reactive even when they reported high levels of
mastery. Constraint was associated with increased physical
reactivity to network stressors for all ages, but it exacerbated
the reactivity of younger and older adults in particular.
Furthermore, younger and older adults with low mastery
exhibited increased emotional reactivity to network stressors.
We interpret these findings as reflecting differences in life
circumstances with age and also stressor domain.
