A business projects its financial performance through its financial statements. An
audited financial statement is considered to be genuine and dependable by the stake-
holders of the business. Therefore, statutory auditors should be self-regulating so that
they can perform their professional role without being influenced by the management.
The current regulatory framework for statutory auditors defines independence require-
ment for a statutory auditor in a professional engagement, points out circumstances
that may create threats to independence and also proposes some measures to safeguard
the same. However, in recent corporate accounting scandals, company's failure led to
devastating cost to the stakeholders, and audit failure was identified to be one of the
causes behind them. Following investigations also sensed possible impairment of statu-
tory auditors' independence in those scams.
In this backdrop, based on the existing literature on this subject, this article identifies
variables influencing positively or negatively statutory auditors' independence in
their professional engagement. Opinions of statutory auditors and select other groups
of respondents were collected. Most of the respondent groups believe that statutory
auditors fail to detect irregularities in financial books due to their lack of independence
and professional scepticism as was observed in this study. Several legal case decisions also
support this finding.Along association between a statutory auditor and a client is one of the
major reasons behind statutory auditors' lack of independence. Opinions of respondents
supported by applicable legal case decisions also proved that lax disciplinary measures and
inadequate inspection framework caused audit failures in many recent cases.
This study also analyses a significant difference of opinion among respondent groups
and identifies the groups having a similar line of thought for each variable. One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test
were conducted, respectively, for these purposes. The result shows that significant
differences exist among the respondent groups for most of the variables. Moreover,
corporate executives have shown a significant difference of opinion from professional
accountants, especially on the issue of statutory auditors' negligence. While corporate
executives believe statutory auditors are negligent in their duty, professional accountants
oppose their views. Applicable legal case decisions also support such findings. Investors
have shown similar views in line with academicians and students.

Summary
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 29
The financial result of a business enterprise is
projected through its profit and loss account,
balance sheet and other financial reports
prepared according to the applicable generally accepted
accounting principles (Banerjee, 2002). Stakeholders
of the business make their financial judgement based
on these statements. But sometimes immoral objec-
tives of showing an inflated financial position lead the
management of a company to manoeuvre its finan-
cial statement. It sometimes even calls for the compa-
ny's termination impacting most of its stakeholders.
Therefore, the legitimacy and dependability of the
financial statement should be certified by a proficient
authority external to the business enterprise. Statutory
financial auditors carry out this role. They are profes-
sional accountants appointed to check the financial
statement of the company and express their opinion on
the working affairs of the business (Gupta, 2005). Apart
from being competent to do their job, they should be
ethical towards their professional obligation. Therefore,
independence of professional accountants serving
as statutory auditors are of supreme importance to
the stakeholders who take financial decisions based
on their report. With a view to supporting statutory
auditors to perform their responsibility with required
integrity and objectivity, governing regulatory bodies
in a country issue certain regulatory pronouncements
(Bakshi, 2000). In India, chartered accountants execute
the function of statutory financial auditors. With a view
to ensuring their independent operation as statutory
auditors and achieving quality audit from them, their
governing regulatory bodies (e.g., Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India, 2009, 2010; Ministry of Corporate
Affairs, 2013; Securities Exchange Board of India,
2013) issue certain regulations (e.g., Code of Ethics
for Professional Accountant, Standards on Auditing,
Standard on Quality Control, Companies Act, 2013,
and Listing Requirements) that clarify their independ-
ence requirement as a statutory auditor (Ghosh, 1999).
However, even with the existence of a strong regulatory
structure, statutory audit failure has been witnessed in
most of the accounting scandals in different countries
(e.g., Enron Corporation Ltd. and Parmalat SpA).
Statutory auditors in those companies failed to identify
and report accounting wrongdoing in the company's
financial statement that resulted in the company's failure
affecting the country's economy and a huge segment
of society. Ensuing investigation also proved statutory
auditors' close nexus with management in some of those
scandals(Copeland,2005).AccountingscandalatSatyam
was a classic example of statutory audit failure due to a
lack of independence (Banerjee, 2011). In this company,
statutory auditors certified inflated financial statement
of the company as free from irregularities. They also
failed to detect control deficiencies. After the revelation
of the scandal, it was proved in the court of law that
statutory auditors did not comply with the applicable
independence requirement and aided management
to commit the accounting fraud (Central Bureau of
Investigation, Hyderabad vs Subramani Gopalakrishnan,
2011). This had put a big question mark on the integrity
of the accounting and auditing profession. In this
backdrop, this article seeks to analyse the perception of
statutory financial auditors and respondents from other
occupational groups having knowledge on this issue.
A SURVEY OF LITERATURE
Statutory auditors' independence is a matter of huge
significance in ensuring consistency and validity of
financial statements prepared by a company's manage-
ment. However, recent corporate accounting scandals
have reflected statutory auditors' lack of judgement and
scepticism in the audit of those companies. Following
investigation also proved that statutory auditors were
not completely independent from the management in
those audit engagements. This situation brings about
a great deal of concern among notable researchers all
over the world. Extensive research has been conducted
on this issue, causes behind the lack of independence of
statutory auditors have been identified, and solutions
have been proposed so that statutory auditors' inde-
pendence could be safeguarded for the protection of
stakeholders' interest.
An auditor plays an important role in the validation
of a financial statement. Integrity, objectivity, and
independence of a statutory auditor influence the
utility of the financial statement (Saxena, 1993). As
stakeholders take their financial decision based on
the judgement of the auditors (Chakraborty, 2004), the
latter should consider their interest with top precedence
(Mehta, 1998; Pyne, 1995). Therefore, statutory auditors
are an important segment of the entire corporate
governance mechanism of the company (Garg, 2001).
In some studies, scholars provided a historical count of
the evolution of professionalism and independence of
statutory auditors (Freier, 2004). Several studies have
covered the stories of recent corporate accounting
frauds (Enron, Satyam, etc.) and proved statutory
30 STATUTORY AUDITORS' INDEPENDENCE IN INDIA: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS' INTEREST PERSPECTIVE
auditors' lack of independence in those scandals
(Arens & Elder, 2006; Copeland, 2005; Pinto & Pinto,
2006; Thibodeau & Freier, 2010). Whenever a corporate
accounting scandal occurs because of a false financial
statement, auditors are considered to be one of the
main parties behind the fraud (Crutchley, Jensen,
& Marshall, 2007; Jennings, 2003). Several authors
have analysed different corporate accounting scam
cases and identified several intimidation to statutory
auditors' independence. The appointment procedure
(Ghosh, 1999) and the provision of non-audit services
(Beaulieu & Reinstein, 2006; Freier, 2004) are two such
examples. We have reviewed several perception-based
studies that ratify the conceptual studies. Safeguards to
these threats offered by an audit client, profession or
audit firm are also analysed in these studies (Fearnley,
Beattie, & Brandt, 2005).
Some researchers have critically analysed the useful-
ness of the present regulation in protecting statutory
auditors' independence (Chakrabarti, 1996; Narielvala,
1998; Rossouw et al., 2010; Shah, 2000; Singh, 2009).
Compliance with applicable regulatory framework
helps a statutory auditor to gain public trust (Bakshi,
2000). However, in some studies, it has been proved that
the present legal structure is insufficient to address the
issue of statutory auditors' independence (Dastur, 1998;
Gowthrope & Blake, 1998; Maurice, 1996). Regular alter-
ation in the current regulations and their appropriate
execution could protect statutory auditors' independ-
ence (Rao, 2009). Non-compliance with applicable regu-
lations brings punitive measures against statutory audi-
tors. Penal sanction against statutory auditors is diverse
in different countries. However, the presence of a strong
disciplinary framework deters an auditor from compro-
mising his/her independence (Bakshi, 2000). The enact-
ment of Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002, following the Enron
scandal is considered to be a significant regulatory mile-
stone in the history of statutory auditors' independence
(Arens & Elder, 2006). Several perception-based studies
have been carried out on the effectiveness of SOX Act,
2002. Subject to certain reservations, most of the authors
have concluded that this new Act is very effective in
improving statutory auditors' independence and corpo-
rate governance structure of a company (Carillo, 2008;
Hill, McEnroe, & Stevens, 2005; Rezaee & Riley, 2002).
After the enactment of SOX Act, 2002, the importance
of an oversight authority is deeply realized. Oversight
bodies like Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (PCAOB) supervise audit operations in a country
and decrease the scope of any possible nexus between
statutory auditors and management (Godbole, 2004).
In the present-day environment, when statutory auditors
are extending their operations in global frontiers, several
authors have proposed the convergence of individual
code of ethics of the individual countries and the enact-
ment of a uniform code of conduct all over the world
to help statutory auditors avoid any ethical dilemmas
in cross-country audit engagements (Pendergast, 2002;
Vittal, 2000).
Apart from regulatory measures, another important
safeguard to statutory auditors' independence is the
audit committee. It is an important board committee
with majority of members as independent directors and
is responsible for controlling issues that have significant
influence on statutory auditors' independent operations
(Godbole, 2004). Therefore, independence of the audit
committee from the management can go a long way
towards the effective implementation of independence
requirementforstatutoryauditors(Tipgos&Keefe,2004).
External review of the audit work is another important
safeguard to statutory auditors' independence. An
independent third party makes a statutory auditor more
careful about his/her independence obligation. In India,
it is known as the peer review process. Studies have also
compared external review in India with that of other
countries of the world (Gerotra & Baijal, 2002).
All these mechanisms discussed earlier in the article
externally influence statutory auditors' independ-
ence. But until the statutory auditors internally realize
the need for these independence obligations, effective
results cannot be obtained. Only ethics and values can
internally guide a person to attain a cherished result.
Therefore, ethics has always remained an important
area of research under this theme. Some researchers
focused on the concept of ethics, its evolution, and
different ethical concepts proposed by ethical leaders
of our society (Duska, Duska, & Ragatz, 2011; Maurice,
1996) while others conducted several perception-based
studies with advanced statistical tools to analyse ethical
dilemmas faced by statutory auditors and the means to
resolve them (Jeffrey, 2004; Roy, 1997; Zadek, Pruzan, &
Evans, 1997). An ethical audit gives a statutory auditor
enormous contentment which cannot be measured in
monetary terms (Chauhan & Gupta, 2007). However,
in the present sociopolitical environment, ethics and
values are incessantly decreasing not only in auditing
profession but in every sphere of our life (Ghosh,
1999; Ray, 1995). Tainted family values, ethical sense
and cultural framework are the main reasons behind
recent ethical failures. Accounting regulators, business,
audit firms, and academic institutes should work hand
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 31
in hand to provide a moral framework for statutory
auditors (Copeland, 2005; Mayper et al., 2005). Ethical
orientation of a person in this profession can get better
only through education, practical training, and orienta-
tion programmes.
Some authors affirmed that the present curriculum for
professional accountants was not sufficient to improve
their ethical orientation (Ravenscroft & Williams, 2004).
Therefore, a complete modification of the accounting
course was proposed with an emphasis on ethics (Arens
& Elder, 2006; Banerjee, 1993; Chakraborty, 2008; Earley
& Kelly, 2004; Ghaffari, Kyriacou, & Brennan, 2008;
Gowthrope & Blake, 1998). Criminology, psychology,
and other behavioural sciences should also come under
the purview of the current curriculum of professional
courses (Curtis, 2008). Based on different statistical
methods, the impact of an accounting scandal on the
moral thinking of prospective statutory auditors was
also analysed. It was thus found that practical training
on ethical needs would help statutory auditors to
understand the regulations with a practical approach
and to resolve their ethical dilemmas in professional
engagements (Bakshi, 2000; Lomax, 2003).
In recent times, researchers have identified some
emerging areas in auditing that could play an impor-
tant role in reducing accounting scandals. One such
area is forensic audit where statutory auditors along
with experts from other professions investigate the
financial misdeed by a company and propose solutions.
Forensic audit is also gaining importance in the current
accounting curriculum (Curtis, 2008).
RESEARCH GAP
From the above discussion, it is clear that researchers,
who have contributed their considerate opinion on this
issue, identified specific threats and safeguards to stat-
utory auditors' independence. Ethics and values are
important considerations for independent operation of
statutory auditors. Therefore, many studies have incor-
porated ethics as an important determinant of statu-
tory auditors' independence. Several perception-based
studies on independence or ethics with complex statis-
tical techniques have been reviewed as well. Studies
reviewed so far have only dealt with specific issues
that positively or negatively affect statutory audi-
tors' independence. There is, however, an absence of
a comprehensive discussion taking into consideration
all the issues together. Besides, the perception of only
statutory auditors has been considered so far. But the
opinion of other respondent groups that by virtue of
their occupation are closely related with the statutory
audit process or are in a position to give an opinion on
this issue has not been considered in those studies. This
gap in the existing literature prompts us to take up this
current study and empirically analyse the opinion of
statutory auditors and other groups of respondents on
statutory auditors' independence for protecting stake-
holders' interest.
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The major objectives of the study are as follows:
1. To analyse the overall opinion of sample respond-
ents from each occupational category on select vari-
ables influencing statutory auditors' independence.
2. To empirically analyse the significant difference in
the opinion of select occupational groups for those
variables.
3. To statistically group individual respondent catego-
ries for select variables based on a significant differ-
ence of opinion among them.
4. To draw a suitable conclusion on statutory auditors'
independence for protecting stakeholders' interest.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Data
This study is exploratory in nature and is based on both
primary and secondary data, the latter being collected
from books, journal articles, newspaper articles, and
legislations. Several legal case decisions in India
especially of the Supreme Court of India involving
statutory auditors' duties and responsibilities in
different companies were also considered, as they have
direct bearing on the interpretation of various laws,
rules, and regulations governing statutory auditors'
independence. Primary data were collected from
Kolkata, West Bengal, during June 2011 to December
2013 through pretested, close-ended, and structured
questionnaire. Through convenience sampling (Ho,
Ong, & Seonsu, 1997), respondents were selected from
different occupational groups, for example, chartered
accountants, cost and management accountants,
academicians, students, investors, and corporate
executives. The rationales for selecting individual
respondent categories and profile of respondents are
given in Tables A1 and A2.
32 STATUTORY AUDITORS' INDEPENDENCE IN INDIA: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS' INTEREST PERSPECTIVE
Based on books, research papers and judicial case
decisions, 25 variables were selected. These variables
were converted into statements and incorporated in
the questionnaire with Likert 5-point scale (5 repre-
senting `strongly agree' (SA), 4 representing `agree'
(A), 3 representing `neutral' (N), 2 representing `disa-
gree' (D), 1 representing `strongly disagree' (SD))
(Kothari, 2010).
Analysis of Collected Data
The mean sample score of each respondent cate-
gory for each variable was calculated in addressing
the first objective of the study. Mean scores represent
the opinion of a particular respondent group. As far
as the second objective is concerned, one-way anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to analyse
significant difference of opinion among respondent
groups. Finally, Tukey's honestly significant difference
(HSD) test was conducted in order to group individual
respondent categories into homogeneous subsets. SPSS
17.0 was exercised for the purpose of analysis.
Selection of Variables
From the literature survey, variables that positively or
negatively influenced statutory auditors' independence
in a professional engagement were identified (Table 1).

Statements Rationale for Variable Selection based on Secondary Data and Legal Cases Decision at the Judiciary
V
1
Negligence of Statutory
Auditors
Stakeholders of a business depend upon statutory auditors' opinion. Hence, negligence on the part of statutory
auditor is a contravention of Clauses 6, 7, and 8 of Part I of the 2nd Schedule of Chartered Accountants Act,
1949 (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, 1949).
Cases at judiciary from long past have shown instances of statutory auditors' negligence (refer to Tri-Sure India
Ltd. vs A.F. Ferguson and Co. and Others, 1985; Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Shri
S.N. Sachdeva, 2011; Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Rajesh Chadha, 2012; Subrata Chattoraj vs
Union of India & Others, 2014). Court judgements in all of these cases proved gross negligence by statutory
auditors.
V
2
Sufficiency of Regulatory
Framework
Insufficiency in regulatory framework often fails to redress statutory auditors' ethical dilemma which ultimately
lead them to compromise their independence. In our country, regulatory framework comprising Companies
Act, 2013, Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, and Code of Ethics provide sufficient regulatory support to statutory
auditors' independence.
Sufficiency of regulatory framework was a governing issue of statutory auditors' independence in an old case of
Fraser and Ross, Chartered Accountants vs Sambasiva Iyer and Others (1968).
V
3
Lack of Enforceability of
Regulatory Framework
If regulatory framework governing statutory auditors is not properly enforced, their independence is not
protected. In recent cases, relating to statutory audit failure, it was observed that statutory auditor did not
comply with applicable SAs while performing audit engagements (Price Waterhouse & Co. vs Securities and
Exchange Board of India, 2010).
There was also contravention of Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 (refer to Council of Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India vs Praveen Kumar Katyal, 2011) and Code of Ethics (refer to Yogeshwari Kumari vs
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, 2010). All these cases certainly raise our concern on appropriate
enforcement of existing regulation.
V
4
Procedure of Appointment
of Statutory Auditors
If management of the audit client controls appointment of statutory auditors, they could easily be intimidated to
give opinion in management's favour.
At Satyam, there was deficiency in control structure (refer to Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India, 2011). It allowed management to control the appointment procedure.
V
5
Appointment by
Independent Authority
In government companies, appointment of statutory auditors is made on recommendation of the government
(refer to Gurugobinda Basu vs Sankari Prasad Ghosal, 1963). In such companies, possibilities of management's
influence in appointment procedure are quite less. Appointment made by an independent regulatory authority
could safeguard statutory auditors from threats arising out of appointment procedure.
V
6
Long Association between
Statutory Auditor and Client
Long association between statutory auditor and client creates a nexus between them. In recent cases, statutory
auditors were associated with their client for a long period. In Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India (2011), the auditors were associated with the company for a period of 7 years.
Now, as per the recent Companies Act, 2013 which states that individual auditors are not allowed to be
associated with client for a period beyond 5 years, it was a clear contravention of existing regulation.
V
7
Rotation of Statutory Auditor Continuous rotation of auditor could break the nexus created due to long association. Recent provisions in
Companies Act, 2013 could reduce familiarity threats to statutory auditors' independence.
Table 1 continued

Maximum Limit of Audit Fee High remuneration makes a statutory auditor financially dependent on the management. A limit to such
economic dependence is therefore needed. In the legal case Gurugobinda Basu vs Sankari Prasad Ghosal
(1963), auditors received remuneration from two companies which were at conflicts of interest between
themselves. It was a contravention of Companies Act, 1956.
In Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2011), statutory auditors received
exorbitant fees for audit and non-audit services.
In the legal case Shri Mahendra Kumar Mahajan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2012), auditors
received fees both as auditors and members of management. All these real life case examples prompt us to
propose a maximum limit to the total remuneration that can be paid to an auditor.
V
9
Close Relationship between
Statutory Auditor and
Management
Close relationship with management members often influence an auditor to issue a clean report without
undertaking proper audit procedure. There are several instances where auditors were closely related with
members of the client company.
In the legal case Shri Mahendra Kumar Mahajan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2012), the
partner of the accounting firm was also in the managing board of the client. In the legal case, Yogeshwari
Kumari vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2010), the auditor was also the director of the company.
It was a contravention of Code of Ethics.
V
10
Provision for Non-Audit
Services
Certain non-audit services by statutory auditors sometimes influence independent review process. In several
recent cases, it was observed that auditors provided consultancy services to the company contravening the code
of ethics, for example, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs L.K. Ratna & Others (1986); Talluri Srinivas
vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2010); Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs
Praveen Kumar Katyal (2011).
In some other legal cases, statutory auditors provided certain services without taking permission from the
professional institute which held them responsible for contravening Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. Other
such cases are: Fraser and Ross, Chartered Accountants vs Sambasiva Iyer and Others (1968); N.K. Gupta vs
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (1990); Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Shri
S.N. Sachdeva (2011), etc.
V
11
Prohibition of Non-Audit
Services
Complete prohibition of non-audit services by statutory auditors could be solution to the aforesaid problem. Recent
Companies Act, 2013 have specified some services which could not be provided by an auditor to its audit client.
V
12
Strong Disciplinary
Framework
Strong disciplinary framework discourages statutory auditors to get involved in professional misconducts.
Disciplinary Committee of ICAI decides on the disciplinary sanction against a statutory auditor based on severity
of his crime. Professional misconduct as defined in Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 attracts disciplinary
sanction.
In India highest disciplinary sanction was provided to statutory auditors at Satyam. It was imprisonment and
cancellation of membership certificate (refer to Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad vs Subramani
Gopalakrishnan, 2011). However, in most of the cases, statutory auditors are either reprimanded (Council of
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs Shri S.N. Sachdeva, 2011) or their names are removed from the
list of practicing members for a period ranging from 1 to 3 years (refer to Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India vs Rajesh Chadha, 2012; Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs K.K. Gupta, 2008).
In some of these legal cases, sometimes the defendant auditor files a petition against the punitive action taken
against them. Based on merit of the case, the court may approve or dismiss their appeal. Hence, a strong and
effective disciplinary framework is a prerequisite of independent audit.
V
13
Strengthening Audit
Committee
Audit Committee is an independent board committee nominated by the shareholders to look after their interest
by keeping a constant oversight on statutory auditors' selection and performance. Strengthening competence
and independence of this committee will safeguard statutory auditors' independence.
In some known scandals (refer to Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, 2011),
internal control system was not sufficient and the Audit Committee failed to perform its role. The result is well
known to us. Hence, a strong Audit Committee is also required for helping auditors in independent audit process.
V
14
Effectiveness of Peer Review
Committee
Compliance of technical and ethical standard in an audit engagement is reviewed by a select member of the
Peer Review Committee under Council of Chartered Accountants of India. This mechanism enforces existing
regulation on statutory auditors' independence. In some cases, regulatory authorities in India conduct separate
audit in the company's books and find out the lacuna in existing audit procedures.
In the legal case Partha Ghosh vs Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2009), special audit done by RBI
identified some irregularities which could not be found by the auditors.
Though peer review enforced by ICAI is a comprehensive mechanism, in legal case P. Rama Krishna vs Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India (2010), it was observed that both audit partner and concurring review partner
in the client company was from the same accounting firm. Hence, the review was not an independent review.
Effectiveness of peer review mechanism is thus an important tool to ensure statutory auditors' independence.

Modification in Company
Law
Recent introduction of Companies Act, 2013 incorporates certain new provisions aiming at protection of statutory
auditors' independence. Its provisions relating to rotation of auditors, non-audit services are some of them.
V
16
Establishment of Oversight
Authority
Recent Companies Act, 2013 mandates establishment of National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) which,
with many of its other activities, is supposed to oversee audit operations in the country. It is expected to enforce
regulatory pronouncements on statutory auditors' independence.

Need for Ethical Education Ethical education in every sphere of life could help a person to understand the true meaning of ethics and its
impact on their decision making (Mayer et al., 2005).
V
18
Incorporation of Ethics in
Accounting Curriculum
Inclusion of ethics in professional accounting curriculum could help a statutory auditor to understand the
ethical implication of their every professional decision (Ghaffari et al., 2008).
V
19
Need for Awareness
Programme by ICAI
Awareness programmes on ethics could facilitate a practical approach to the ethical knowledge. This sometimes
may prove to be beneficial in resolving ethical dilemma.
V
20
Need for Orientation
Programme by ICAI and
Academic Institute
A constructive collaboration between professional bodies and academic world could facilitate exchange of
ideas in a wide spectrum. It will result in improvement in accounting curriculum and ethics will get a special
importance in it (Copeland, 2005).
V
21
Need for Practical Training
to Resolve Ethical Conflict
Practical training on ethics directly addresses ethical problems faced by a statutory auditor. Legal case Fraser
and Ross, Chartered Accountants vs Sambasiva Iyer and Others (1968) shows that lack of statutory auditors'
independence was mostly due to statutory auditors' lack of ethical awareness which could be improved through
broad academic training.
V
22
Rewarding Statutory
Auditors for Ethical Practice
If statutory auditors get rewarded for ethical performance, it might provide other auditors some impetus to be
ethical in their future engagements.
V
23
Uniformity of Code of
Conduct
In cross-country audit engagements, auditors falter in their ethical duty by using the loopholes of regulatory
mismatch in two countries. This situation could be avoided if regulatory framework across the globe were
uniform (Vittal, 2000).
V
24
Lucidity in Audit Report Most of the investors do not have technical knowledge in the fields of accounting or auditing. Hence, Audit
Report should be made more lucid for understanding of the common investors.
V
25
Mass Media's Role of Public
Awareness on Audit Ethics
In this media-centric environment, ethical awareness of auditors should be spread with the help of newspaper,
television, and social networking sites. It could improve the current situation.

Perceptions of 601 respondents from different occupa-
tions on these variables were collected using a pretested,
close-ended, and structured questionnaire based on the
method specified in the research methodology.
Demographic Profile of Respondents
A brief demographic profile of the respondents is given
in Table 2.
Table 2 reflects the general characteristics of the sample:
Small proportion of female respondents indicates
male domination in the sample. Demographic profile
of respondents based on their age signifies that
respondents with diverse level of experience have
participated in the study.
Sample respondents were selected on the basis of their
occupation. From the demographic profile, it is clear
that there was maximum participation from academic
communities (academicians and students), followed
by statutory auditors ­ Chartered Accountants (CAs)
and Cost & Management Accountants (CMAs). Other
two groups are also important for the current research.
Though the proportion of respondents from inves-
tors and corporate executives is less than the other four
groups, their considerable participation makes the total
sample a balanced one.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Analysis of Overall Opinion of Individual
Respondent Categories for Each Variable
The opinion of respondents on each of the select
variables was incorporated in a data sheet and analysed
with the help of a statistical software. As mentioned in
the research methodology, each respondent's degree of
agreement with a particular variable was represented

Table 3 continued
Following inferences can be drawn from Table 3:
All the respondents believed that statutory auditors
were negligent in performing their duties in the case
of recent corporate setbacks. Some of the legal cases,
referred to in this study, also point to the same conclu-
sion. In some of these cases, statutory auditors failed
to verify assets of the company (refer to Council of
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs V Rajaram
of V Rajaram and Co., 1959), while in some other cases,
they failed to perform with due diligence (refer to
Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs R
Ayyavoo, 2003). There were some cases where statutory
auditors published their report without collecting suffi-
cient and appropriate pieces of evidence on a particular
issue (refer to Narayanan Nambudiri vs Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India, 2005). In a nutshell, there
are ample examples where statutory auditors failed to
detect irregularities in the books of accounts of a corpo-
rate enterprise (refer to Council of Institute of Chartered
38 STATUTORY AUDITORS' INDEPENDENCE IN INDIA: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS' INTEREST PERSPECTIVE
Accountants of India vs R N Bahl, 2006). Some audit fail-
ures were due to absolute negligence on the part of the
auditor, while others were due to their alleged lack of
independence. All these legal case examples support
the empirical finding of this study that statutory
auditors are negligent in performing their duties.
Long association with audit client and close relation-
ship with management impairs a statutory auditor's
independence in a professional engagement. In the legal
case, Tri-Sure India Ltd. vs AF Ferguson and Co. and Others
(1985), statutory auditors were associated with the client
for a long period of time. However, at that time, rota-
tion of the auditor was not a mandatory requirement.
The result on close professional relationship is also
supported by the legal case Subramani Gopalakrishnan vs
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (2011).
Rotation of the auditor, maximum limit of audit fee,
strong disciplinary framework, external review of audit
work, modification in company law, establishment of
oversight authority, and all the activities that go on
improving ethical orientation of statutory auditors have
been proposed as a measure of solution by the entire
sample. Cases like Satyam (refer to Talluri Srinivas vs
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, 2010) could be
avoided if there was a limit on the total remuneration
at the time of the Satyam scandal. A strong disciplinary
structurecouldalsoescapemanymorefraudcases(refer
to Council of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India vs
Praveen Kumar Katyal, 2011) that took advantage of the
lax disciplinary framework. Individual respondents are
widely segmented among themselves for their opinion
on each variable.
In most of the cases, the sample from academic commu-
nity is found to behave uniformly. On the other hand,
statutory auditors represented by CAs and CMAs
have similar views on some issues. Corporate execu-
tives mostly go with the views of academic community.
Investors are rather sceptical on the solutions provided
to improve statutory auditors' independence.
Analysis of Significant Difference in the Opinion
of Select Occupational Groups
With a view to analyse the significant difference in the
opinions of select respondent categories, the following
steps were taken:
1. Hypothesis. The opinion of individual respondent
categories is represented by their mean scores.
Therefore, with a view to test whether a significant
difference exists in the opinion of the population
of individual respondent categories, the following
null and alternate hypotheses were proposed:
Null Hypothesis (H
0
): Population mean of individual
respondent categories are equal.
Alternate Hypothesis (H
1
): Population mean of any two
respondent categories are not equal.
2. Statistical Test. With a view to test the afore-
said hypotheses for each of the variables selected
under this study, one-way ANOVA (Driscoll, 1996)
was conducted. It is a parametric test conducted
to determine whether an independent variable
has an influence on the dependent observations.
In this study, the occupation of respondents is the
independent variable. If significant difference does
not exist among individual respondent categories,
it can be inferred that occupation does not have
significant influence on individual observations of
respondents.
3. Test Statistics. Test statistics (F) in one-wayANOVA
is calculated based on the following formula
(Kothari, 2010):
F = MS
between
/MS
within
,
where MS (Mean Square)
between =
SS (Sum of Square)
between
/(C ­ 1); MS

C = Number of categories
N = Total sample size.
4. Degree of Freedom (DF). Degree of freedom is the
number of values in the final calculation of statis-
tics that are allowed to vary. For one-way ANOVA,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2016 39
mean squares are calculated by dividing the sum
of squares by their respective DF. Therefore, in
one-way ANOVA, there are two DFs: C ­ 1 and N
­ C. In this study, the number of categories is 6 and
the total sample size is 601. Therefore, DFs calcu-
lated for each variable under study is 6 ­ 1 and 601
­ 6, that is, 5 and 595, respectively.
5. Level of Significance. The level of significance refers
to the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.
If the level of significance for a particular research
is 5 per cent, it may be inferred that the decision of
acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis is 95 per
cent true. In social science research, this level of signif-
icance may vary from 1 per cent to 10 per cent. This
study has considered 5 per cent level of significance.
6. Decision Rule. With a view to taking decision on
acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis for a
particular variable, this study used the F distribu-
tion table to find out a value very close to the test
statistics at 5,595 DFs. For this value, the corre-
sponding (P-value) was then identified. This is
the probability of getting the test statistics at 5,595
DFs. If it is at more than 5 per cent significance
level, the test statistics is considered to be in the
acceptance region. So, H
0
is accepted. But if this
probability is less than 5 per cent, H
0
is rejected,
following the same rule. Accordingly, inferences
are drawn on the significant difference of opinion
between respondent categories for select variables
and the impact of occupation on the opinion of
respondents.
Based on the data collected from the sample respond-
ents, the result of one-way ANOVA and the inferences
for each categorical variable have been incorporated
in Table 4.

Table 4 continued
The following inferences can be drawn from Table 3:
Respondent categories significantly differ among
themselves regarding their opinion on the negligence
of a statutory auditor. Though the result suggests
that corporate executives do not consider statutory
auditors to be negligent, there are instances where
the corporate executive or client has been found to
have lodged a complaint against the statutory audi-
tors for their alleged lack of independence (refer to
legal case: Tri-Sure India Ltd. vs A. F. Ferguson and Co.
and Others, 1985).
Individuals, irrespective of their occupation, believe
that ethical education is needed for ethical orientation
of statutory auditors, thereby calling for its incorpo-
ration in the present accounting curriculum of profes-
sional courses.
Individual occupational groups are significantly
different in their opinion for all other issues that posi-
tively or negatively influence statutory auditors' inde-
pendence. It shows occupation having an important
influence on the opinion of respondents for these vari-
ables. In the legal case, Yogeshwari Kumari vs Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India (2010), the client had
lodged a complaint against the auditor for being the
director of the client company. From this case, it can be
inferred that the perception of the client and the auditor
about the impact of a relationship with the manage-
ment on independence is completely different. This
case supports the empirical finding of this study on
close relationship with management.
Homogeneous Groups of Occupational Categories
The null hypothesis of equality of population mean in
one-wayANOVAis rejected if any one of the population
means is significantly different from that of the others.
Therefore, it is possible that while some population
means are statistically different, some means are not.
With a view to analyse exactly which population means
are statistically different, sample mean differences of
each individual pairs of categories were calculated. A
null hypothesis was proposed that population mean
differences are not statistically significant. To test it,
42 STATUTORY AUDITORS' INDEPENDENCE IN INDIA: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS' INTEREST PERSPECTIVE
Tukey's HSD test, a post hoc test to one-way ANOVA
(Malhotra, 2003) was applied, using the same degrees
of freedom and significance level as that of ANOVA.
If the P-value for each mean difference is less than the
significant level, H
0
is rejected and it is concluded that
there is a significant mean difference between that pair.
In this study, where six occupational categories were
considered, it is possible to find out exactly which
occupational categories are significantly different
among each other for each variable. Based on this
theory, individual occupational categories can be
grouped into homogeneous subsets. In each subset,
respondent categories do not have a significant differ-
ence of opinion. Homogeneous groups of occupational
categories formed by administering this test on the
sample for the select variables and its inferences are
summarized in Table 5.

46 STATUTORY AUDITORS' INDEPENDENCE IN INDIA: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS' INTEREST PERSPECTIVE
measures for safeguarding statutory auditors'
independence.
For issues that improve ethical orientation of statutory
auditors, all occupational categories exhibit a similar
line of thought.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
Considering the entire sample, procedure of appoint-
ment, tenure of service, and close relationship with
management emerged as the major influencing factors
of statutory auditors' independence.
Rotation of auditors, strong disciplinary framework,
external review of audit work, and all the activities that
improve the ethical orientation of the statutory audi-
tors are considered to be important safeguards to statu-
tory auditors' independence.
Individuals irrespective of their occupation believe that
ethical education is needed for improving ethical orien-
tation of the statutory auditors and it should be imme-
diately incorporated in the accounting curriculum of
professional courses.
Individual occupational categories are significantly
different in their opinion for all other variables that
positively or negatively influence statutory auditors'
independence.
Most occupation categories believe that the lack of
enforceability of regulatory framework, procedure
of appointment, tenure of service, and provision of
non-audit service could impair statutory auditors'
independence.
Most of the occupation categories also believe that the
rotation of auditors and strong disciplinary frame-
work strengthen the audit committee, and that effec-
tive peer review committee, modification in company
law, awareness, orientation and training programmes,
and rewards for ethical service could restore statutory
auditors' independence.
Most of the occupational categories do not think that
fixing a maximum limit on remuneration would in any
way reduce cases of statutory audit failure.
LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
This study has the following limitations:
1. Multivariate statistical techniques, for example,
factor analysis or cluster analysis are not applied for
the current dataset.
2. Difference in the opinion of respondent catego-
ries could also be tested using the non-parametric
Kruskal­Wallis Test.
3. Apart from statutory auditors' independence, no
other governance related issues that protect stake-
holders' interest are considered.
CONCLUSION
Statutory auditors validate `truth and fairness' in
financial statements. Financial statements authenti-
cated by statutory auditors are considered trustworthy
by the stakeholders of the business. They take their
financial decision based on the financial statement
with utmost good faith in statutory auditors. However,
in an in-depth examination of the recent corporate
accounting scandals, a few outrageous companies
have been found to falsify their financial statement for
quite a long period of time. Big and highly regarded
accounting firms related with these companies as statu-
tory auditors failed to recognize those frauds resulting
in the publication of a false financial statement which
ultimately led to a catastrophic consequence to the
company impacting most of its stakeholders. In this
backdrop, this study critically reviews relevant liter-
ature and identifies certain variables that positively
or negatively influence statutory auditors' independ-
ence. The opinion of respondents from different occu-
pational categories is collected on these variables.
The mean score of individual respondent categories
represents their opinion for each select variable. The
overall mean score shows the opinion of the entire
sample. Different occupational categories are signifi-
cantly different in their opinion for most of the varia-
bles except for ethical education to build ethical orien-
tation of statutory auditors. Significant differences of
opinion between all individual pairs of respondent
categories are analysed and respondent categories
are grouped into homogeneous subsets. It is observed
that professional accountants and academic commu-
nities normally behave in a distinct fashion. Investors
and corporate executives align with these two major
groups based on the nature of a particular variable. If
the study findings are given due importance in times
to come, an all-round improvement in statutory audi-
tors' independence can be expected.

APPENDIX
Table A1: Rationales for Selecting Individual Respondents Categories
Chartered Accountants (CA) CAs plays the role of statutory auditors of financial statements in the Indian companies. Naturally they have hand
on work experience and knowledge in the field of statutory auditors' independence. So, CA's both in practice and
service, are included in the study.
Cost and Management
Accountants (CMAs)
CMAs are professional accountants entrusted with the responsibility of auditing cost related information in a
company by statute of law. Therefore, they are also called statutory auditors. Although, the study mainly covers
statutory financial auditors, CMAs, both in practice and service, also come within the purview of our research as
professional accountants.
Academicians Academicians from undergraduate colleges, Universities and Business Schools in Kolkata, who are specialized in the
subject of accounting and auditing and have research orientation in the related field, are included in the present study.
Students Students especially from commerce background pursing their post-graduation from university or business school or
students appearing for the final examination of Chartered Accountancy course are expected to bring their modern
thoughts on a barring issue like statutory auditors' independence. Naturally they are included as a respondent category.
Investors Investors who invest their own money in the stock market, and institutions like banks, insurance companies or
mutual funds companies who accumulate money from the individual savers and invest it in the capital market are
the main target respondents under this category. For having opinions of institutional investors, correspondents from
Kolkata regional offices of these companies have been interviewed.
Corporate Executives Corporate executives from big public limited or private limited companies, who look after Accounts or Finance
Department in their company and deal with statutory auditor, are the direct representative of the management.
Their nature of work allows them to closely observe the commitment of statutory auditors towards their
independence requirement in a professional engagement. Therefore, corporate executives are a fairly important
segment in the current study.
Method of Data Collection All the respondents from aforesaid occupational groups were contacted on a personal basis over phone and
interview meeting held after an appointment was taken as per their convenience. Their opinion on each of the
statement of the questionnaire was incorporated.
Source: Authors' compilation based on discussion with select groups of respondents as a part of Pilot Survey.
