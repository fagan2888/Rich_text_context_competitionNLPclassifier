Scholars have long debated the reasons un-
derlying Asian Americans' exceptional edu-
cational outcomes. Psychologists emphasize
individual cognitive ability and the effects of
stereotypes on performance (1). Culturalists
point to values, beliefs, norms, and behavioral
patterns unique and intrinsic to ethnicity (2).
Structuralists focus on socioeconomic status
within and beyond the family, including a
group's position in a society's status hierarchy
(3, 4). Data limitations and quantitative mod-
eling constraints, combined with contentious
ethnic politics, have rendered social scientists
at an intellectual stalemate. This standstill has
consequences: The lack of a strong social sci-
ence voice in the debate has lead pundits to
liberally evoke culture to explain poor or ex-
ceptional group outcomes (5, 6); the simplis-
tic framing of group culture has fanned fury,
pitted groups against each other, and led Civil
Rights activists to advocate for group interests
to promote a political agenda. Meanwhile, the
general public has remained deprived of
knowledge generated from rigorous scientific
research. However, Amy Hsin and Yu Xie
propel the debate forward with their refresh-
ing analyses and insight in their PNAS report,
"Explaining Asian Americans' academic ad-
vantage over whites" (7).
The Asian-White Achievement Gap
Based on nationally representative cohort
longitudinal surveys, Hsin and Xie (7) use
sophisticated statistical techniques to develop
multilayer decomposition models that si-
multaneously test three competing hypothe-
ses: psychological (individual cognitive ability),
cultural (belief in academic effort), and struc-
tural (family socioeconomic background).
The authors use Asian­white gaps in edu-
cational outcomes (rather than outcomes
per se) as their dependent variable, and
control for factors that differ across schools.
Hsin and Xie find a persistent Asian­white
gap in educational outcomes. They also
find that the difference in academic effort,
rather than in cognitive ability or socio-
demographic characteristics, explains the
Asian­white gap.
Hsin and Xie then press forward to ad-
dress why Asian American students put more
effort into their schoolwork than their white
peers, pointing to the significance of the
cultural belief that Asian immigrant
parents hold about the positive relationship
between effort and outcomes. The authors
also estimate the costs of Asian American
students' academic achievement and effort
and find a host of negative consequences:
Asian Americans are significantly less likely
than comparable whites to have positive
feelings toward themselves, they spend less
time socializing with friends, and they expe-
rience more conflict with both parents.
Analyses disaggregating Asians into four main
ethnic groups--East Asian, South Asian, Fil-
ipino, and Southeast Asian--and controlling
for sex do not change the general patterns.
Hsin and Xie's (7) analyses have yielded
powerful and conclusive evidence to confirm
that culture--as measured by increased ef-
fort--accounts for Asian Americans' academic
advantage. Hsin and Xie have put culture back
on the map by proactively engaging in the
debate about its role in explaining the Asian­
white achievement gap. The authors define
culture as a shared belief in the positive cor-
relation between effort and outcomes, mea-
sure culture in terms of academic effort, and
test competing hypotheses in a single empir-
ical analysis. They clearly and convincingly
find a cultural effect, which advances a classic
sociological idea that cultural beliefs are as-
sociated with particular behaviors that con-
strain or enable particular outcomes (8­10).
Unanswered Questions about Asian
Americans' Academic Advantage
Although they empirically show that Asian
Americans have an academic advantage over
whites, Hsin and Xie (7) are limited by the
available data and are unable to investigate
how Asian immigrant parents pass on the
cultural belief about effort in a way that
affects their children's behaviors and out-
comes. Moreover, Hsin and Xie can only use
a proximate measure of academic effort: that
is, teachers' subjective ratings of students'
attentiveness, task persistence, and eagerness
to learn. Teachers may be biased in their
ratings of students, but even if we assume
that there is no bias on the part of teachers,
two questions still remain. First, how and why
do Asian immigrant parents pass onto their
children the cultural belief that increased ef-
fort leads to more positive outcomes? Second,
given the high costs associated with effort and
high achievement, how have Asian Ameri-
cans managed to academically excel despite
the overwhelming pressure they experience,
especially in a racially stratified society?
Here is where our qualitative study can
help answer these lingering questions. Based
on face-to-face, in-depth interviews with
adult children of Chinese and Vietnamese
immigrants randomly drawn from the survey
of Immigration and Intergenerational Mo-
bility in Metropolitan Los Angeles, we fo-
cused on their lived experiences from their
perspectives, what we call a "subject-centered
approach" (11, 12). We examined the ways in
which immigrant parents and their children
framed success, as well as the resources they
used to support and reinforce the frame. We
found that the differences in the cultural
frame and the resources used to support it
help to explain why the children of some Asian
immigrant groups get ahead, despite their
socioeconomic disadvantage.
The Success Frame
Three main findings from our study are
particularly relevant and effectively comple-
ment Hsin and Xie's (7) research. First, the
adult children of Chinese immigrants and
Vietnamese refugees articulate a strict "suc-
cess frame," which entails getting straight As
in high school, attaining a degree in a presti-
gious university, and securing a well-paying
job in one of the four coveted professions:
science, engineering, medicine, and law.

COMMENTARY
This narrow success frame contrasts with
broader success frames adopted by adult
children of Mexican immigrants, as well as
native-born blacks and whites. However, we
caution that the success frame is not innate to
Asian culture or being Asian, but rather is
a product of being a child of Asian immi-
grants in the United States.
Believing that upward social mobility is
possible in the United States, but fearing that
their children will face racial discrimination
because of their non-white status, Asian
immigrant parents shepherd their children
into the path that will best predict a suc-
cessful professional outcome. Fields such as
science, engineering, medicine, and law re-
quire exceptional educational achievement,
credentials, and "hard skills" that may obvi-
ate or lessen potential discrimination from
employers, coworkers, and clients. This re-
quirement explains why Asian immigrant
parents actively work to support the success
frame and pass it onto their children. For
example, even when they encourage music
lessons for their children, Asian immi-
grant parents do so because they wish their
children to be more well-rounded and,
therefore, more competitive applicants to elite
universities, rather than because they want to
nurture their children's musical talent, per se.
Second, Asian immigrant parents have
access to tangible and intangible resources
generated in the ethnic community that not
only reinforce the success frame, but also
help them access institutional resources in
public schools. These ethnic resources are
difficult to capture in quantitative data. For
example, in our study we find that the Chi-
nese and Vietnamese immigrant communi-
ties have developed an elaborate system of
supplementary education--private after-
school services, such as tutoring, examination
cram and drill classes, college prep courses,
and enrichment programs, with a wide range
of price tags--which the children of Chinese
and Vietnamese immigrants of different so-
cioeconomic backgrounds can afford. The
Korean community has similarly developed
an elaborate ethnic system of supplementary
education in the United States (13, 14).
Most of our respondents reported that
they had participated in these ethnic after-
school or summer school programs. Tapping
into tangible ethnic resources means that
Asian American students put extra effort in
their schoolwork outside of school, and this
extra effort may affect students' behavior in
school and may also affect teachers' ratings of
them. In addition, participation in after-school
programs exposes students to an ethnic envi-
ronment in which they have access to other
intangible ethnic resources, such as positive
role models to show that the success frame
is realistic and attainable. This approach ex-
plains how Asian immigrant parents pass on
the belief of the importance of effort despite
intense parent­child conflicts.
The Hyper-Selectivity of Asian
Immigration
However, tangible and intangible educational
resources are not equally available in immi-
grant or ethnic communities, and immigrant
selectivity and hyperselectivity are critical
here. Immigrant selectivity refers to the
phenomenon in which those who immigrate
to the United States are more highly educated
than their counterparts who stay behind.
Whereas most immigrant groups are highly
selected in this regard, there is substantial
variation in the degree of educational selec-
tivity depending on the country of origin and
the timing of migration from a particular
country (15). Asian immigrants to the United
States are highly selected from their countries
of origin, which is not happenstance; US
immigration policies afford an edge to appli-
cants with high skills.
In addition, Asian immigrants are more
highly educated than average Americans, de-
spite the tremendous heterogeneity in their
countries of origin. We refer to this dual se-
lectivity as "hyperselectivity": a unique set of
group characteristics that helps immigrants
selectively import cultural practices (such as
the success frame and after-school academ-
ics) from their countries of origin, fine-tune
them, and then recreate those that are most
useful for social mobility in their host society.
The importing of specific cultural practices
and institutions underscores our point that
culture is not essential or fixed but, rather,
a dynamic resource that is shaped by immi-
grant selectivity and hyperselectivity.
Furthermore, our research helps to shed
light on Hsin and Xie's (7) finding about the
lower subjective well-being of Asian American
students. The cultural frame comes at a cost,
and is a double-edged sword for the children
of Asian immigrants. Because Chinese and
Vietnamese Americans use high-achieving
coethnics (rather than native-born whites or
the average coethnic) as their reference group,
those who do not meet its strict tenets feel like
ethnic outliers or failures and, as a result, they
distance themselves from coethnics and from
their ethnic identities (11). This finding has
broader implications for theories of assimila-
tion; today's non-white second generation do
not turn to native-born whites as their refer-
ence group or their model for success.
Concluding Remarks
In closing, we would like to call attention to
the unique ways in which qualitative data
and mixed methods can help to inform the
debate about culture and group outcomes.
Although there is a well-established body of
research driven by "hard" data, including
Census and survey data, data that capture the
diverse lived experiences of younger-gen-
eration Asian Americans are relatively
scant. However, simply increasing the amount
of data will not necessarily improve data
quality, and simply combining quantitative
and qualitative methodologies will not guar-
antee accurate representation (16). Further-
more, even the most sophisticated theoretical
paradigms and ingenious empirical models
will do little to advance knowledge if we fail
to a priori critically assess our underlying
assumptions about the ways in which culture
may affect group outcomes. There is growing
diversity among the Asian American pop-
ulation and their educational outcomes, sig-
naling that the subfield will be ripe for new
and informed research for years to come (17).
