Abstract
Background: Data on the association between chronic conditions or the number of
chronic conditions and sleep problems in low- or middle-income countries is scarce,
and global comparisons of these associations with high-income countries have not
been conducted.
Methods: Data on 42116 individuals 50 years and older from nationally-
representative samples of the Collaborative Research on Ageing in Europe
(Finland, Poland, Spain) and the World Health Organization's Study on Global
Ageing and Adult Health (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa)
conducted between 2011­2012 and 2007­2010 respectively were analyzed.
Results: The association between nine chronic conditions (angina, arthritis,
asthma, chronic lung disease, depression, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and
stroke) and self-reported severe/extreme sleep problems in the past 30 days was
estimated by logistic regression with multiple variables. The age-adjusted
prevalence of sleep problems ranged from 2.8% (China) to 17.0% (Poland). After
adjustment for confounders, angina (OR 1.75­2.78), arthritis (OR 1.39­2.46), and
depression (OR 1.75­5.12) were significantly associated with sleep problems in the
majority or all of the countries. Sleep problems were also significantly associated
with: asthma in Finland, Spain, and India; chronic lung disease in Poland, Spain,
Ghana, and South Africa; diabetes in India; and stroke in China, Ghana, and India.

conditions, the OR (95%CI) for 1,2,3, and§4 chronic conditions was 1.41 (1.09­
1.82), 2.55 (1.99­3.27), 3.22 (2.52­4.11), and 7.62 (5.88­9.87) respectively in the
overall sample.
Conclusions: Identifying co-existing sleep problems among patients with chronic
conditions and treating them simultaneously may lead to better treatment outcome.
Clinicians should be aware of the high risk for sleep problems among patients with
multimorbidity. Future studies are needed to elucidate the best treatment options for
comorbid sleep problems especially in developing country settings.
Introduction
The prevalence of insomnia increases with age [1], and in Western countries, it
has been reported to be as high as 50% among older adults [2]. Insomnia among
the elderly is an important health issue as it has been associated with a higher risk
for poorer overall health [3], lower quality of life [4, 5], and morbidity including
falls [6] and institutionalization [7], and cognitive impairment [8]. Furthermore,
the treatment poses a challenge especially among the elderly due to the frequent
coexistence of physical and mental disorders, polypharmacy, and the side effects
of drugs commonly used to treat sleep problems [9]. Indeed, up to 90% of
insomnia patients have been reported to have comorbid physical and/or mental
illnesses such as mood disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,
hypertension, and diabetes [10, 11].
Insomnia may be the result of the chronic conditions, or may be the precursor
of the chronic conditions. Alternatively, it may share the same underlying factors
or be an incidental condition. Insomnia subsequent to chronic conditions has
been traditionally called `secondary insomnia' but due to the complexity of the
association where the temporal association or causality is not always clear, the
term `comorbid insomnia' to denote this condition was introduced in 2005 by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) State-of-the-Science conference statement on
chronic insomnia [12].
Older adults are particularly susceptible to comorbid insomnia since the change
in sleep architecture associated with age, specifically lighter sleep, renders them
increasingly vulnerable to sleep disruption caused by physical and mental illnesses
[13]. Despite this, to date, data on comorbid sleep problems among older adults
in low- or middle-income settings is scarce. This is an important research gap as
the proportion of the global population 60 years and older residing in developing
countries was 65% in 2010 and this figure is projected to increase to 80% by 2050
[14]. Furthermore, there is a rapid increase in chronic diseases in developing
countries [15]. In addition, a progressive increase in the prevalence of sleep
complaints has been observed in Brazil between 1987 and 2007 [16], and a recent
large multi-country study from Asia and Africa focusing on adults aged 50 years

Chronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults

and older reported the prevalence of severe/extreme sleep problems to be as high
as 43.9% among Bangladeshi women, with prevalence figures higher than 25%
observed also in Vietnam and South Africa, suggesting that there may be an
under-recognized emerging global epidemic of sleep problems [17].
Thus, the aim of the current study was to assess the association between chronic
conditions or the number of chronic conditions and sleep problems among older
adults using nationally-representative data from nine countries which participated
in the Collaborative Research on Ageing in Europe (COURAGE) survey (Finland,
Poland, and Spain) and the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health
(SAGE) survey (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa) for global
comparisons. We restricted the analysis to those 50 years or older as sleep
problems and chronic diseases are more prevalent in this age group [9, 18].
Understanding the epidemiology of comorbid insomnia or sleep problems and its
co-existing morbidity is important to guide clinicians as insufficient sleep may
also exacerbate the underlying condition and be affecting overall quality of life and
wellbeing.
Methods
We analyzed data from the COURAGE and SAGE studies. The SAGE dataset is
publically available online (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/sage/en/). The details
of the two surveys have been published elsewhere [19, 20]. At the time of the
survey, countries in the COURAGE and SAGE surveys corresponded to high-, and
low- or middle-income countries respectively according to the World Bank
classification (http://data.worldbank.org/country/). Briefly, the two surveys
followed the same protocol and used standardized questionnaires to collect
information on health and well-being among adult populations. Nationally-
representative samples were generated by multistage clustered sampling. The
sample consisted of non-institutionalized adults §18 years of age with
oversampling of those aged§50 years. The COURAGE was conducted between
2011­2012 in Finland, Poland, and Spain, and the SAGE was conducted between
2007­2010 in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa. The
response rate ranged from 51% (Mexico) to 93% (China). All data were collected
through face-to-face interviews and measurements by trained interviewers. If the
interviewer judged that the participant was unable to reply to the survey questions
due to limited cognitive function, a shorter questionnaire was used with a proxy
respondent replying on behalf of the participant. Blood pressure was measured 2
and 3 times in the COURAGE and SAGE surveys respectively with a #1 minute
interval using standard protocols [21]. Height and weight were measured with the
use of a stadiometer and a routinely calibrated electronic weighting scale
respectively. Sampling weights were generated to adjust for the population
structure reported by the United Nations Statistical Division for the SAGE, and
the census of the National Institute of Statistics for the COURAGE. These weights
were post-stratified to weight up to the total number of individuals aged §18

years in each country. Ethical approval to conduct the COURAGE and SAGE
surveys was obtained from local research review boards and the WHO Ethical
Review Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Variables
Sleep problems was assessed by the single question ``Overall in the last 30 days,
how much of a problem did you have with sleeping, such as falling asleep, waking
up frequently during the night or waking up too early in the morning?'' Answer
options were none, mild, moderate, severe, extreme/cannot do. Those who had
severe or extreme problems were considered to have sleep problems in keeping
with the approach used in a previous study from the SAGE surveys [17].
The self-reported diagnosis of eight chronic medical conditions [angina,
arthritis, asthma, depression, chronic lung disease, diabetes (not associated with
pregnancy), hypertension, and stroke] was based on whether the participant had
ever been diagnosed to have these conditions. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared and obesity
was defined as BMI§30 kg/m2. We used the combined criteria for the diagnosis
of chronic conditions with the exception of diabetes, for which no information
other than self-report was available, and obesity. The combined criteria referred to
self-reported diagnosis and/or diagnosis based on past-12 months symptoms with
the exception of hypertension which was based on blood pressure measurement,
and stroke which was based on lifetime symptoms. The combined diagnosis
allowed for the inclusion of those who would not have been diagnosed as having
the condition based on self-report alone. Although self-report of diseases has been
shown to demonstrate good agreement with medical records in developed
countries [22], in settings with limited access to health care systems, under-
reporting of diagnosis may be a problem. In the latter setting, patients may be less
aware of their illness or may only have them detected when they are severe [23].
As for the diagnosis based on symptoms or blood pressure measurements,
angina was based on the algorithms of the Rose questionnaire [24], depression
was based on the algorithms of the DSM-IV for major depressive disorder, and
hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure §140 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure §90 mmHg. The symptom-based definitions for
arthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease, and stroke were based on typical clinical
symptoms and were identical or similar to those used in previous publications
using the same questionnaire [23, 25­27]. Arthritis was defined as having
experienced pain, aching, stiffness, or swelling in or around the joints (like arms,
hands, legs or feet) which were not related to an injury and lasted for more than a
month, and having experienced stiffness lasting for less than 30 minutes in the
joint in the morning after getting up from bed or after a long rest of the joint
without movement which goes away after exercise or movement in the joint.
Asthma was defined as having had an attack of wheezing or whistling breathing
and at least one of the following: attack of wheezing after stopping exercise or
some other physical activity; a feeling of tightness in the chest; experience of

waking up with a feeling of tightness in the chest; attack of shortness of breath
without obvious cause when not exercising or doing some physical activity.
Chronic lung disease referred to having all of the following: shortness of breath at
rest; coughing or wheezing for ten minutes or more at a time; coughing up
sputum or phlegm for most days of the month for at least 3 months. Stroke was
defined as ever having suffered from sudden onset of paralysis or weakness and
loss of sensation on one side of the body for more than 24 hours. The number of
chronic conditions was based on the nine aforementioned chronic conditions and
was categorized as 0,1,2,3, and 4 or more.
The selection of the control variables used in the models was based on past
literature [28­32]. These included sex, age (50­59, 60­69, 70­79,§80 years),
highest level of education completed (#primary, secondary,§tertiary), wealth
quintiles based on country-specific income, marital status (currently married/
cohabiting or not married), past-30 days alcohol consumption (no, yes), current
smoking status (no, yes), and physical activity levels based on the Global Physical
Activity Questionnaire (high, moderate, low).
Statistical analysis
Participants whose information was obtained through the proxy questionnaire
were excluded from the analysis as information on a large number of the variables
pertaining to the current analysis was not collected. Analyses were conducted
using the pooled sample including all countries and also by country. Country-wise
analyses were conducted as one of our main objectives was to assess the between-
country differences in terms of the association between chronic conditions and
sleep problems. Chronic conditions in the main text referred to those diagnosed
by the combined criteria in all analyses with the exception of data presented in
Table 1 where the prevalence of chronic diseases based on both the self-reported
and the combined diagnoses are shown. Analyses based solely on self-reported
chronic conditions are shown only in the appendix as sensitivity analysis.
The crude prevalence of baseline characteristics of the study sample was
calculated (Table 1). The age-adjusted prevalence of sleep problems and chronic
conditions was calculated using the United Nation population pyramids for the
year 2010 (http://esa.un.org/wpp/Excel-Data/population.htm) as the standard
population (Table 2). The difference in the prevalence of sleep problems by the
presence or absence of the individual chronic conditions was tested by chi-
squared tests (Table 3). Logistic regression analyses with multiple variables were
done to assess the association between the chronic health conditions or the
number of chronic health conditions (independent variable) and sleep problems
(dependent variable). In the analysis assessing the association between the
individual chronic health conditions and sleep problems, the models were
mutually adjusted for the nine chronic conditions in addition to age, sex,
education, wealth, marital status, alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical
activity (Table 4). The nine chronic conditions were included simultaneously in
the models as these conditions tend to co-occur [25], and have all been associated

with sleep problems [10, 33­46]. In the analysis on the association between the
number of chronic health conditions and sleep problems, the models were
adjusted for age, sex, education, wealth, marital status, alcohol consumption,
smoking, and physical activity (Table 5). A test for trend was conducted by
including the number of chronic conditions in the model as a continuous
variable. Adjustment for country was also done for regression models that pooled
data of all countries by including countries as dummy variables in the models. The
sample weighting and the complex study design were taken into account in all
analyses to generate nationally-representative estimates using the Stata svy
command. We analyzed data with Stata version 12.1 (Stata Corp LP, College
Station, Texas). The level of statistical significance was set at P,0.05.
Results
The analytical sample size, after excluding those whose information was obtained
by the proxy questionnaire and individuals aged,50 years, was 42116 (China
13175, Finland 1452, Ghana 4305, India 6560, Mexico 2313, Poland 2910, Russia
3938, South Africa 3838, Spain 3625).
The baseline characteristics of the study sample are illustrated in Table 1. The
median age ranged from 60 years (India, Mexico, and South Africa) to 65 years

adjusted prevalence of severe/extreme sleep problems and chronic conditions are
demonstrated in Table 2. The overall prevalence of sleep problems was 9.2% and
ranged from 2.8% (China) to 17.0% (Poland) with the highest prevalence
observed in India (15.0%) among the SAGE countries. A large between-country
difference in terms of the prevalence of some chronic conditions was observed.
For example, the prevalence of self-reported angina ranged from 2.8% (Mexico)

were significantly associated with higher prevalence of sleep problems in all
individual countries as well. In the majority of countries, a significantly greater
likelihood for sleep problems was observed for all the other chronic conditions as
well although this association for hypertension and obesity were observed in fewer
countries. The associations between sleep problems and chronic conditions
estimated by logistic regression with multiple variables are illustrated in Table 4

with significant 1.75­2.78 times higher odds for sleep problems in all countries
except Mexico. Similarly, arthritis was significantly associated with 1.39­2.46
times higher odds for sleep problems in all countries with the exception of Mexico
and South Africa. The likelihood for sleep problems was significantly higher
among asthmatics in Finland, Spain, and India. As for chronic lung disease,
significantly higher odds for sleep problems were observed in Poland, Spain,
Ghana, and South Africa. Depression was linked with higher odds for sleep
problems in all countries. Diabetes was associated with a significant 1.82 times
higher odds for sleep problems only in India. Hypertension and obesity were not

between stroke and sleep problems was observed in China, Ghana, and India. The
association between the number of chronic conditions and sleep problems is
shown in Table 5 (results for all covariates in the models are available in Table S2
of the Appendix). A significant linear dose-dependent relationship between the
number of chronic conditions and sleep problems was observed in all samples.
Finally, the results of the sensitivity analyses based solely on self-reported
diagnoses were generally similar to the main analysis with changes in statistical
significance occurring more commonly in the SAGE countries than the
COURAGE countries (Appendix Table S3, S4, S5). In particular, self-reported
hypertension was associated with sleep problems in Finland, India, and Mexico
despite the fact that hypertension based on self-report and/or blood pressure
measurement was not associated with sleep problems in any of the countries.
Discussion
Our study has shown that sleep problems among older adults were common in
countries such as Poland (17.0%), India (15.0%), and Russia (9.0%), and that
many common chronic conditions are associated with sleep problems even after
adjustment for confounders. No distinct patterns regarding the association
between sleep problems and individual chronic conditions were observed by
region or the level of economic development of the country. The strength of our
study is the large sample size and the use of nationally-representative datasets
from diverse settings. Also, our diagnostic definition incorporating symptoms or
blood pressure measurement is likely to have reduced under-diagnosis especially
in resource-limited settings. We also adjusted for depression which many previous
studies failed to do despite its strong association with sleep and physical illness
[47]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-continent study to
examine the association between chronic conditions and sleep problems.
Several limitations deserve mentioning before discussing the results. There are
no standard definitions for insomnia or sleep problems in epidemiological
research [48]. Although we used a single-item question to define sleep problems,
the question encompassed the three dimensions of insomnia (i.e. problems falling
asleep, waking up frequently during the night, and waking up too early in the
morning) [49]. Also, the use of severe or extreme categories to define sleep
problems is likely to have improved the specificity. However, we were unable to
conduct detailed analyses on the severity, type, or chronicity of the sleep problem
which would have lead to better understanding of the association between sleep
problems and chronic conditions. Next, we attempted to reduce under-diagnosis
of chronic conditions by the use of an algorithm based on symptoms but the use
of non-validated instruments for arthritis, asthma, chronic lung diseases, and
stroke may have lead to higher sensitivity at the expense of lower specificity.
However, in order to minimize misclassification, we used algorithms based on
current clinical guidelines and reference publications [25]. Furthermore, due to
the high potential for under-diagnosis especially in resource-limited settings, as
Chronic Conditions and Sleep Problems among Older Adults

evidenced by a higher rate of discrepancy between the two diagnostic definitions
especially in the SAGE countries, we believe that this procedure was necessary and
justifiable to address our study question. Next, due to the difficulty in
differentiating chronic lung diseases such as COPD and asthma because of the
overlapping symptoms especially among older populations [50], varying degrees
of misclassification depending on the setting is likely to have occurred. Also, we
did not have information on caffeine intake or conditions such as anxiety
disorder, sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, migraine, restless leg syndrome, and
neurological disorders known to be associated with sleep problems [10, 48, 51].
Thus, their independent and confounding effects remain unknown. In addition,
some country-wise analyses may have lacked statistical power due to small sample
size. Moreover, the COURAGE and the SAGE surveys were conducted in different
years ranging from 2007 to 2012. Thus, the data may not reflect the current
situation in some countries. Finally, because this was a cross-sectional study,
causality cannot be inferred.
Data from high-income countries have reported associations between sleep
disturbance and angina [33], arthritis [34­37], asthma [36­38], chronic lung
disease [37, 39], diabetes [37, 40­42], depression [10], hypertension [37, 43],
obesity [44], and stroke [45], although the results for hypertension [36, 43, 46] are
less consistent. One of the only studies from developing countries on comorbid
insomnia conducted in Nigeria reported a significant association between
insomnia and arthritis, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, asthma, but not
diabetes [52]. In our study, angina, arthritis, chronic lung disease, and depression
were significantly associated with sleep problems in the majority or all of the
countries studied, and significant associations between other chronic conditions
were also observed in fewer countries with the exception of hypertension and
obesity.
The associations between sleep problems and the chronic conditions may be
explained by the co-existence of sleep-disordered breathing in conditions such as
chronic lung disease, diabetes, and stroke [53, 54], or symptoms of the chronic
conditions per se (e.g. nocturnal symptoms in asthma [38], COPD [54], and
angina [55], and nocturia in diabetes [56]). Furthermore, recent studies have
pointed to the potential role of insomnia in the future occurrence of metabolic
and cardiovascular diseases [43, 57, 58]. The association between arthritis and
sleep problems may be mediated by pain [34, 35] and physical limitation [35].
Depression is the condition most likely to co-exist with chronic insomnia [10],
and sleep problem is one of the core symptoms of depression, which has also been
linked to the subsequent onset of many psychiatric disorders including depression
[59]. Finally, these associations may also be explained by psychological distress
and anxiety associated with these conditions [60, 61].
Although the reason for between-country differences in the association between
chronic conditions and sleep problems is unclear, one may speculate several
reasons. First of all, the question on sleep may have been interpreted differently
between countries. Secondly, the accuracy of the diagnosis of chronic medical
condition or its severity may have differed depending on the country.

Furthermore, non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment [62] for insomnia
may have been more common in some settings. Finally, a variety of drugs to treat
chronic conditions, such as SSRIs and beta-blockers, may induce insomnia [10]
and these drugs may have been more commonly prescribed in some areas.
Previously, treating the comorbid condition was believed to lead to the
improvement in sleep conditions. However, evidence is emerging that this might
not be the case, and that better treatment outcome may be expected if insomnia is
treated separately, possibly even for the underlying chronic condition [10].
Although most previous clinical trials demonstrating the added benefits of
treating insomnia in conjunction to the co-existing morbidity are on mental
disorders [11], or arthritis [63, 64], sleep deprivation among those with COPD has
been reported to lead to a small fall in forced expiratory volume and forced vital
capacity [65], and studies have also shown that short sleep may impair glucose
tolerance among individuals with and without diabetes [66]. Furthermore, sleep
problems may affect immunity, inflammation or cause distress, which may
contribute to severity of disease [37].
There are currently no treatment algorithms specifically for comorbid
insomnia, but several treatment options for comorbid insomnia have been
proposed and include pharmacologic, and non-pharmacologic treatments such as
cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene, and relaxation training [11]. In
resource-limited settings, many of the hypnotics used in developed country
settings may not be available [62], and cost-effectiveness is a more crucial issue.
In conclusion, this study has shown that comorbid sleep problems affect
individuals in developing and developed countries alike. Longitudinal studies
especially in low- or middle-income countries, where only limited data exist [67],
are warranted to understand the cause-and-effect relationships between chronic
conditions and sleep problems. Medical personnel should consider the possibility
of co-existing mental or physical conditions for patients presenting with
symptoms of insomnia, and for those patients with a chronic condition,
identifying co-existing sleep problems and treating them simultaneously may lead
to better treatment outcome. Also, clinicians should be aware of the particularly
high risk of sleep problems among those with multimorbidity. Future studies are
needed to elucidate the best treatment options for comorbid sleep problems
especially in resource-limited settings.
