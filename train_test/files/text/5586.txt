Abstract
Objective: This systematic review aimed to define the relationship between diabetes mellitus
(DM) and the risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH).
Methods: Studies associated with DM and aSAH published until March 2016 were retrieved from
Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. A random-effects model was
used to calculate the relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: Eighteen observational studies were retrieved. The overall RRs for DM and aSAH were
RRs ¼ 0.59 (0.44, 0.79), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 55.7%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.000). Subgroup
analysis by study quality revealed a reduced association between DM and aSAH risk in high quality
studies only (RRs ¼ 0.40, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.56; I2 ¼ 0.0%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.549), therefore study
quality may be a source of heterogeneity.
Conclusion: A potential decreased risk of aSAH in DM patients was found in high quality studies.
Further studies are required to confirm this causal relationship and to investigate the biological
mechanisms.

Introduction
Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage
(aSAH) comprises 85% of all SAH
cases.1,2 Approximately 17,000 people in
the United States are affected by aSAH
each year.3 It has been deemed a serious
subtype of stroke with high fatality rate and
poses a significant threat to public
health.1,4­8 Despite the recent advance in
treatments and management, the poor prog-
nosis has not been improved.9 Effective
prevention based on a better understanding
of the etiology of aSAH is vital. Some
researchers have reported that race, female
sex, age, cigarette smoking, hypertension,
heavy alcohol intake, and family history are
predisposing risk factors for aSAH.10­14
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most
common endocrine disorder and a major
cause of disability worldwide.15 It is calcu-
lated that the number of DM patients will
increase from 246 million to 380 million over
the next twenty years16 due to burgeoning
population, changed lifestyles, and popula-
tion ageing.17 DM influences the arterial
wall by different mechanisms18­20 and
is a well-known trigger for cerebral
infarction.21,22
A recent study suggested that DM was
associated with a decreased risk of saccular
intracranial aneurysm rupture, which may
cause aSAH.23 However, multiple epidemio-
logic studies have produced inconsistent and
inconclusive results regarding the relation-
ship between DM and aSAH.10,24­40 Hence,
we conducted a systematic review and meta-
analysis to evaluate the current evidence
from published observational studies relat-
ing to the association between DM and the
risk of aSAH.
Materials and methods
We conducted this systematic review and
meta-analysis in adherence to the guidelines
of the Meta-analyses of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group.41
Data sources and searches
Two investigators (X.Y. and C.J.) independ-
ently performed a systematic search of
literature published until March 28, 2016
in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and
Cochrane Library databases. The following
search terms were used: (diabetes OR dia-
betes mellitus) AND (intracranial aneurysm
OR intracerebral aneurysm OR cerebral
aneurysm OR subarachnoid haemorrhage)
AND risk. No restrictions on language or
types of publications were imposed. The
reference lists of retrieved publications were
also searched for additional relevant studies.
Study selection
Studies were included in our meta-analysis if
they met the following criteria: 1) The study
design was a cohort or case-control study; 2)
the study described the impact of DM on the
risk of aSAH; 3) the study presented odds
ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), or rela-
tive risks (RRs) with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) (or sufficient data
to calculate them). In instances where mul-
tiple reports were based on the same study
population, we included the most inform-
ative and comprehensive studies in our
systematic review.
Data extraction and methodological
quality assessment
Study selection and data extraction were
conducted respectively by two investigators
(X.Y. and C.J.). We extracted the following
information using a standardized collection
form: the first author's last name, year of
publication, study period, study design,
number of aSAH patients and participants,
source of controls, outcome data, and
adjustment for major confounding factors.
The study quality of each included case-
control or cohort study was assessed using
the Critical Appraisal Skills Program
(CASP).42 These questions appraised
1142 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
the study validity, risk of bias in recruit-
ment, exposure and outcome measurement,
confounders, the reported results, generaliz-
ability, and transferability. Each single
included study was independently assessed
by two reviewers (X.Y. and C.J.). Any
disagreements were judged by a third inves-
tigator (G.J.) and settled by consensus.
Statistical analysis
If the prevalence of aSAH was rare, ORs
and HRs were considered equal to RRs.43
So, a RR with 95% CI was used to measure
the relationship between DM and aSAH. If
outcomes for males and females were pro-
vided, then risk estimates for males and
females were regarded as two separate
results.44 The Cochran's Q test was used to
assess the statistical heterogeneity (signifi-
cant if P < 0.10).We employed I2 statistics to
evaluate the degree of heterogeneity among
included studies.45 We applied the random-
effects model, which combined both within-
and between-study heterogeneity to
summarize the risk estimates.46 Subgroup
analyses were made for study design and
study quality assessed by CASP. Sensitivity
was analysed by omitting one study at a time
to assess the stability of the pooled conse-
quences. We examined the potential evi-
dence of publication bias by Begg funnel
plots and Egger's test.47,48 A P-value
of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically sig-
nificant. All statistical tests were performed
using STATA 12.0 software (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Literature search
The electronic search yielded 1,295 potential
articles. Duplicates and studies that did not
meet the inclusion criteria were excluded.
After this, 18 studies were chosen for
detailed appraisal. Among them, one
study49 only contained an abstract; three
studies23,50,51 were neither case-control stu-
dies nor cohort studies; four studies52­55 did
not report the association of DM with the
risk of aSAH; one study56 came from the
same study population. The remaining nine
studies30­38 of interest were found by
manual searching. Thus, 18 studies10,24­40
were included in our meta-analysis. The flow
chart of our searching process is shown in
Figure 1.
Description of included studies
Characteristics of the included studies
are presented in Table 1. Studies were pub-
lished between 1991 and 2015. Six of the 18
included studies25,26,29,30,35,39 were conducted
in Japan, three31,33,34 in the United States,
two32,36 in Australia and New Zealand,
and one each in Finland,10 Germany,38
England,40 the Netherlands,37 Portugal,24
Mexico,27 and India.28Fifteen24­38 studies
were case-control studies and three10,39,40
were cohort studies that reported the correl-
ation between DM and the risk of aSAH.
Except for one32 study that only included
female subjects, males and females were
included. Various covariates were adjusted
in most studies, although these differed
between studies.
Only one study distinguished between
type 1 and type 2 DM; this study described
the association between type 2 DM and the
risk of aSAH.40 Most studies did not define
DM and confirmed DM through the
patient's medical history. Nevertheless,
three10,24,39 studies defined DM according
to the World Health Organization's criteria,
and one27 used the definition established by
the standard guidelines of the American
Diabetes Association. In most studies,
aSAH was diagnosed using computed tom-
ography and/or cerebral angiography. Some
studies used surgery or necropsy and cere-
brospinal fluid analysis to confirm the diag-
nosis. A few studies30,37,40 confirmed aSAH
from the medical history. Most studies
Yao et al. 1143
reported participant satisfaction; two stu-
dies10,38 showed < 90% satisfaction and par-
ticipant satisfaction was not reported in two
studies.24,32
Methodological quality assessment
The study quality assessment is presented in
Tables 2 and 3. In total, five 26,27,29,39,40
studies were high quality and the others were
poor quality. Seven25,26,28,30,34,35,38 case-
control studies recruited controls from hos-
pitals, which was not representative of the
participants. Results from two24,35 studies
contradicted other available evidence. Most
studies only adjusted for age and sex.
Adjustment for other important confoun-
ders such as cigarette smoking, hypotension,
alcohol consumption, body mass index
(BMI), and cholesterol varied among the
studies. Two39,40 studies adjusted for the use
of antihypertensive drugs. Very few studies
investigating the risk of DM and aSAH
adjusted for other chronic diseases, such as
heart26,29 and liver disease.26
Qualitative association of DM
and aSAH risk
Data were available on 2,005,419 partici-
pants, including 4,327 aSAH patients. All
included studies except two24,35 reported

reduced RRs for aSAH patients with DM
versus non-DM. Knekt et.al.10 and another
two39,40 cohort studies did not show a
significant reduction in the association
between DM and aSAH risk with regard
to sex. However, Inagawa reported a statis-
tically inverse correlation between DM and
aSAH risk in female participants, especially
those who were  60 years of age.26,29 The
largest cohort study40 from England
revealed a significantly decreased associ-
ation [HR, 0.48 (0.26,0.89)] between DM
and aSAH risk, while other European
studies gave non-significant results. Most
high quality studies were from Asia26,29,39
and these authors reported conflicting
outcomes.
Synthetic association of DM and aSAH
risk
RRs for the association of DM and aSAH
risk were calculated in 18 studies and ranged
from 0 ­ 2.7.10,24­40 Overall, DM signifi-
cantly reduced the risk of aSAH [0.59 (0.44,
0.79)], with substantial heterogeneity
(I2 ¼ 55.7%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.000). Forest
plots of the association between DM and
aSAH risk are presented in Figure 2.
Subgroup analyses
Study design
The correlation between DM and aSAH was
evaluated in three cohort studies and 15
case-control studies (Table 4). The summar-
ized RR was 0.34 (95% CI: 0.09, 2.14;
I2 ¼ 68.4%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.013) in the
cohort studies,10,39,40 and 0.61 (95% CI:
0.46, 0.82; I2 ¼ 53.1%, Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.001)
in case-control studies.24­38

Discussion
The incidence of cerebrovascular disease is
1.7 times higher in diabetic patients than
non-diabetic persons.57 The cerebrovascular
complications of DM are restricted to ath-
erosclerotic disease and cerebral infarction,
and the frequency of cerebral infarction is
higher than expected in diabetic
patients.58,59 However, the Harvard
Cooperative Stroke Registry reported a
low occurrence of DM in patients with
aSAH.60 To date, the contribution of DM
to the development of aSAH remains
unclear. In our systematic review, all
included studies except for two24,35 reported
a decreased association between DM
and aSAH risk. This meta-analysis
using RRs from 15 case-control studies
and three cohort studies included more
than 2,000,000 individuals, therefore our
findings indicate that DM reduces the risk
of aSAH.

Strengths and limitations of this
systematic review
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
systematic review and meta-analysis to focus
on the association between DM and risk of
aSAH. All available published studies with a
sufficient number of participants for a quali-
tative and quantitative summary of the
outcomes were included in this meta-analy-
sis. Therefore, this study has more power
than any individual study to investigate the
relationship between DM and risk of aSAH.
Substantive heterogeneity between stu-
dies was monitored using the I2 statistic. The
findings of observational studies should
always be interpreted with caution.
Subgroup analysis by study design showed
that the majority of included studies were
case-control studies, therefore our conclu-
sions are chiefly based on case-control
studies. Diabetic patients probably have a
higher risk of dying from other diseases than
non-diabetic individuals. Consequently, the
likelihood of a SAH forming is reduced
in DM patients compared with controls.57
At the same time, recall and selective bias
may be increased.
The most important limitation high-
lighted by the current systematic review
was the paucity of high quality studies.
Only half of the included studies were of
high quality. Insufficient study quality may
be a source of heterogeneity according to the
subgroup analysis of study quality. The
CASP clearly demonstrated that recruited
controls were unrepresentative, identified a
large number of unadjusted potential con-
founders, and showed that unprecise results
are the main cause of poor study quality.
Because the study quality was limited and
the heterogeneity was moderate, it was not
possible to show a stronger association for
population characteristics, such as geo-
graphical areas and sex.
Study quality may have been a contribut-
ing factor to heterogeneity, but there were
other potential sources. For example, only a
few studies10,27,39 specifically defined DM.
The lack of a consistent standard definition

1150 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
for DM may have affected the number of
diabetic patients recruited in each study.
Similarly, some studies30,39,40 did not
describe the methods of aSAH diagnosis,
which may also have contributed to
heterogeneity.
Prospective population-based cohort stu-
dies have shown that BMI and cholesterol
levels may be related to DM and may
protect against aSAH.10,61,62 Information
about important risk factors such as
BMI39,40 and cholesterol levels26,39,40 were
only collected in a few studies. Other
important risk factors such as cigarette
smoking, hypotension, and alcohol con-
sumption were generally inconsistent
among the included studies. These factors
have been associated with an increased risk
of aSAH,10­14 but very few studies adjusted
for them. This may explain the unprecise
findings regarding risk of aSAH among the
included studies.
Because the collected information was
limited, we could not distinguish between
type 1 and type 2 DM. This might have
prevented identification of a genuine associ-
ation between DM and risk of aSAH. For
example, in type 1 diabetic patients, the
prevalence of nonaneurysmal SAH was high
in a prospective cohort study.55 Because the
quality of the included studies was generally
poor, we did not calculate the RR and 95%
CI to detect more sources of heterogeneity,
such as the methods for measuring diabetes,
antidiabetic drugs, and duration of diabetes
in each study. Notably, antidiabetic drugs
were used by 9% of type 2 diabetic patients
in a comparative study, but was not related
to the risk of aSAH according to multivari-
ate analysis.
We did not perform an exhaustive search
of the published literature in all electronic
databases; therefore we may have missed
several pertinent published or unpublished
studies. Finally, we found little proof of
publication bias in our meta-analysis.
However, potential publication bias might
have had an impact on our findings, as
statistical tests have shown.47,48
Comparison with previous studies
Feigin et al. performed a meta-analysis63 to
evaluate various SAH risk factors published
before 2005. Surprisingly, they found that
DM was associated with a reduced risk of
SAH [RR, 0.3 (0 to 2.2) including one10
longitudinal study [OR, 0.7 (0.5 to 0.8)] and
six25,30,31,33,38,56 case-control studies].
However, the sample size and study quality
were questionable in this study. The sample
size and study quality 25,27,29,39,40 were better
in the present meta-analysis [RR, 0.38 (0.27,
0.54)]. Our study yielded a narrower 95% CI
of pooled aSAH RR associated with DM
compared with the earlier meta-analysis,
indicating that our results are more precise.
Only two of the included studies reported
an increased association between DM and
the risk of aSAH, largely because of small
sample sizes and univariate analysis. If an
increased association between DM and
aSAH is confirmed by future studies, then
special determination assessment will be
affected, including cerebral angiography of
patients with DM and recent symptoms of
third nerve palsy.64
Hypothetical causes for the reduction
of DM and aSAH risk
Although there are no confirmed biological
theories to support our finding, several
putative explanations exist. Patients with
DM may modify their lifestyles (e.g., more
exercise, better diet, less smoking and drink-
ing) and receive medication for hyperten-
sion, which is an independent risk factor of
aSAH.64 Inagawa suggested that an inverse
association exists between DM and aneur-
ysm rupture, which might be linked to the
atherosclerotic wall because atherosclerotic
aneurysms are less likely to rupture.29 This
might also explain why the decreased
Yao et al. 1151
association is stronger in older diabetic
patients than younger diabetic patients.29
Similar to saccharification of the extracellu-
lar matrix and cross-linking between elastin
and avitene in the aortic wall,65 diabetes-
mediated alterations might exist in the
hemal extracellular matrix.40 Furthermore,
the 9p21.3 locus has been related to DM and
saccular IAs,66,67 although it is not part of
the linkage disequilibrium block. A genetic
connection that enhances type 2 DM and
reduces the risk of aSAH is likely to exist.23
Implication for future research
Future studies will need to be well-designed
and carefully powered to address the fol-
lowing points: (1) consideration of more
potential confounding factors, such as BMI,
cholesterol level, smoking, hypertension,
and drinking; (2) adjustment for or exclu-
sion of chronic diseases (heart disease was
associated with a decreased risk of aSAH,
possibly due to reduced strenuous physical
activity); (3) investigation of possible thera-
peutic mechanisms; (4) classification of DM
as type 1 and type 2 to determine a potential
causal relationship.
Conclusions and unanswered questions
In conclusion, most of the studies included
in our systematic review are lacking in
quality. Analysis of the high quality studies
identified a potential decreased risk of aSAH
in subjects with DM. However, the causal
relationship between DM and aSAH
remains to be elucidated. Further high
quality epidemiological cohort and animal
studies are necessary to investigate whether
DM and aSAH are correlated and to eluci-
date the underlying biological mechanisms.
