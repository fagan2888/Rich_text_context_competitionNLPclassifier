A related development is the increas-
ingdiversityofphysicianpracticearrange-
ments, including an increase in the num-
ber of physicians affiliating with larger
grouppractices,aligningthemselvesmore
closely with hospitals, health plans, and
other large physician organizations, and
giving up ownership of their practice.4,5
These arrangements often allow physi-
cians greater leverage in negotiating with
managed care plans, but they may also
limit charity care provision because phy-
sicians have less autonomy and control
over the patients they see in practice ar-
rangements that are more formal, cen-
tralized, and serve a defined population.
While there is a growing literature
documenting the effects of managed care
on other aspects of the practice of medi-
cine, including physician compensa-
tion, the scope of care, productivity, and
other practice patterns,6-9 (also M.
Gaynor, T. Mark, unpublished report,
1995) there is virtually no research that
has examined how managed care is re-
lated to care of the medically indigent.

Context Health system changes may be affecting the ability of physicians to pro-
vide care with little or no compensation from patients who are uninsured and under-
insured and may result in decreased access to physicians for uninsured persons.
Objective To examine the association between managed care and physicians' pro-
vision of charity care.
Design The 1996-1997 Community Tracking Study physician survey.
Setting and Participants A nationally representative sample of 10 881 physicians
from 60 randomly selected communities.
Main Outcome Measure The number of hours in the month prior to the inter-
view that the physician provided care for free or at reduced fees because of the fi-
nancial need of the patient.
Results Overall, 77.3% of respondents provided an average of 10.3 hours of char-
ity care per week. Physicians who derive at least 85% of their practice revenue
from managed care plans were considerably less likely to provide charity care and spend
fewer hours providing charity care than physicians with little involvement in managed
care plans (P = .01). In addition, physicians who practice in areas with high managed
care penetration provided fewer hours of charity care than physicians in other areas,
regardless of their own level of involvement with managed care (P.01). Differences
in charity care provision were also shown for other important factors, including own-
ership of the practice and practice arrangements (more charity care occurred in solo
and 2-physician practices; P.01).
Conclusion Physicians involved with managed care plans and those who practice
in areas with high managed care penetration tend to provide less charity care.

examine the level of managed care in
physician practice as well as managed
care penetration at the market level. We
also consider other important character-
istics of physician practice, including
practice arrangements and whether the
physician owns his or her practice.
METHODS
Data Source
The data for this study are from the Com-
munity Tracking Study physician sur-
vey conducted in 1996 and 1997.18 The
survey was designed to be representative
ofdirectpatientcarephysiciansinthecon-
tinental United States, as well as in se-
lectedcommunitiesorsites.Thefirststage
of sample selection involved the selec-
tion of 60 sites.19 Metropolitan sites were
defined based on Metropolitan Statisti-
cal Areas as defined by the Office of Man-
agement and Budget, while the Bureau of
Economic Analysis Economic Areas were
used to define nonmetropolitan sites.
The 60 sites were selected with prob-
ability in proportion to population to en-
sure representation of all US physicians
and were also stratified to ensure diver-
sity by region and size. The sample of
physicians for each of the 60 sites was
randomly drawn from the American
Medical Association (AMA) and the
American Osteopathic Association Mas-
terfiles. The sample includes active non-
federal office- and hospital-based phy-
sicians in selected specialties who spend
at least 20 hours per week in direct pa-
tient care. While primary care physi-
cians were oversampled, radiologists, an-
esthesiologists, pathologists, and a few
nonpatient care specialists (eg, legal
medicine) were excluded. Residents and
fellows were also excluded. The aver-
age length of the telephone interview was
20 minutes.
A total of 10 881 physicians in the 60
sites completed the survey between Au-
gust 1996 and August 1997. These phy-
sicians constitute an overall response rate
of 65%. Physicians practicing in certain
types of settings were excluded from this
analysis, including those employed by
medical schools, government-owned fa-
cilities, federally funded community
health centers, and industrial clinics.
These physicians were excluded either
because the issue of charity care is not
particularly relevant (in the case of in-
dustrial clinics) or because these facili-
ties have an explicit mission to serve the
medically indigent and they receive pub-
lic subsidies to do so. After these exclu-
sions, the total sample of physicians for
this study was 9871.
All estimates presented in this article
were weighted to be representative of all
nonfederal patient care physicians in the
continental United States. Weights were
constructed to allow nationally repre-
sentative estimates to be produced from
the 60 sites and to restore proportion-
ality to the sample arising from survey
nonresponse, the clustering of the sample
into 60 sites, and oversampling of pri-
mary care physicians. The weights were
explicitly adjusted to reflect the distri-
bution of physicians by age and spe-
cialty for the nation as well as for each
site, based on the AMA Masterfile. All es-
timates were produced using the
SUDAAN software package, which also
adjusts the SEs of estimates to take into
account the complex sample design.20
Dependent Variable
During the interview, physicians were
asked the following question: "During the
last month, how many hours, if any, did
you spend providing charity care? By this
we mean, that because of the financial
need of the patient you charged either
no fee or a reduced fee. Please do not in-
clude time spent providing services for
which you expected, but did not re-
ceive payment (ie, bad debt)."
This question was derived from the
AMA Socioeconomic Monitoring Sys-
tem survey,2 although estimates of char-
ity care are not directly comparable be-
cause the 2 surveys use different reference
periods when asking about charity care.
Independent Variables
Theextentofmanagedcareinvolvement
was measured as the percentage of total
practice revenue derived from managed
care plans. In the survey, managed care
wasdefinedtoincludeplanssuchashealth
maintenanceorganizations(HMOs),pre-
ferred provider organizations, indepen-
dent practice associations, and point-of-
service plans, including Medicare and
Medicaid managed care plans. This also
includes managed care revenue received
byphysicianswhotreatpatientsonanout-
of-network basis. The percentage distri-
bution of the weighted sample of physi-
cians by percentage of practice revenue
from managed care plans is shown in
TABLE 1. The average percentage of rev-
enuefrommanagedcarecontractsforall
physicians--44%--isidenticaltothees-
timatefor1997fromtheAMASocioeco-
nomic Monitoring System survey.21
Managed care penetration at the site
level was measured by computing a
weighted average for each site of the per-
centage of physicians' total practice rev-
enue from managed care plans and then
merging the site-level averages onto the
sample of physicians. This measure is
highly correlated with the more com-
monly used "HMO penetration" mea-
sure (which refers to the percentage of
persons at the site enrolled in HMOs) de-
veloped by InterStudy22 (r = 0.62,
P.001) and is used in this study be-
cause it is a more direct indicator of "fi-
nancial pressure" in the market. The dis-
tribution of the weighted physician
sample by managed care penetration at
the site level is shown in Table 1.
The analysis also controls for a wide
range of physician, practice, and other

market characteristics that are likely to
be associated with physician charity care.
A combined measure for type and size
of organization is included, which clas-
sifies practices as solo or 2-physician
practices, group practices with 3 to 10
physicians, group practices with 11 to 50
physicians, group practices with 50 phy-
sicians or more, staff and group model
HMOs, physicians employed by hospi-
tals, and others (eg, freestanding clinics
and urgent care centers). A question on
whether the physician was a full or part
owner of his or her practice was asked
separately from the questions about prac-
tice arrangements and is also included
in the analysis.
Other practice characteristics include
whether the practice accepts any new pri-
vately insured or Medicaid patients, per-
centage of revenue from Medicaid pa-
tients,physician'sincomerelativetohours
worked, and hours spent providing pa-
tientcareinthepreviousweek.Adichoto-
mous variable, whether the physician
practiced medicine throughout the pre-
ceding year, was also included because
some information (eg, annual income)
only reflects part of the preceding year for
physicians who were not practicing the
entire year. Variables are also included for
sex, years of practice, board certifica-
tion, and whether the physician is an in-
ternational medical graduate. Specialty
categories are identified as family prac-
tice,generalinternalmedicine,generalpe-
diatrics, medical specialties, and surgical
specialties.
Market measures were used to control
for the variation in the (potential) de-
mand for and supply of charity care. The
percentage uninsured at the site (de-
rived from the Community Tracking
Study household survey)is used as amea-
sure of the demand for charity care, while
supply measures include the number of
public hospital beds, teaching hospital
beds, and hospital emergency depart-
ments at the site (all obtained from the
1996 American Hospital Association An-
nualSurvey).23 Thesemeasureswerestan-
dardized relative to the number of unin-
sured persons at the site. It was not
possible to fully assess the effects of all tra-
ditional safety net providers--including
communityhealthcentersandlocalhealth
departments--on physician charity care
because of the lack of data. The number
of nonfederal physicians per capita at the
site was also included.
Analysis
We initially separated the decision to pro-
vide any charity care from the amount
of charity care physicians provide, given
that they provide any. Logistic regres-
sion was used to estimate the likeli-
hood of providing any charity care, while
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression
was used to estimate the log of the num-
ber of hours spent providing charity care
(given that physicians provided any). Log
hours were used because of the highly
skewed distribution of charity care hours.
To account for some nonlinearity in
the relationship between managed care
revenue and charity care, binary vari-
ables representing different levels of prac-
tice revenue from managed care were
used in both regressions. However, a con-
tinuous measure of managed care pen-
etration at the site level was used be-
cause initial tests indicated that this
association was strictly linear.
We then derived expected values from
the 2 regression equations to summa-
rize the effects of managed care on phy-
sician charity care provision. To do this,
predicted values for the probability of
providing any charity care (based on the
logistic regression) were computed for
the various levels of managed care rev-
enue at the practice level and site level.
For physicians who provided any char-
ity care, predicted values for the num-
ber of charity care hours by level of man-
aged care revenue (practice and site level)
were computed from the OLS regres-
sion. Because the OLS regressions were
based on the log of the number of char-
ity care hours, it was necessary to "un-
transform" the predicted values back to
their original scale. Because untrans-
formed values may be biased and incon-
sistent with the original scale, a "smear-
ing factor" based on the exponentiated
mean of the regression residuals was used
to adjust the predicted values of charity
care hours.24 Although the smearing fac-
tor itself may be biased when the residu-
als are heteroscedastic,25 tests indicated
that this was not a problem with re-
spect to managed care revenue.
Expected values for total charity care
hours were then obtained by comput-
ing the product of the 2 individual pre-
dictions for each level of managed care
revenue (practice and site level).
RESULTS
Overall, 77.3% of physicians in our study
provided some charity care in the month
prior to the interview (data not shown).
Physicians who provided some charity
care spent an average of 10.3 hours on
charity care. The regression results show
that physicians with the heaviest level of
involvement with managed care plans
(85% of practice revenue) are signifi-
cantly less likely to provide any charity
care (TABLE 2, column 1) and provide
fewer hours of charity care (column 2)
compared with physicians with only 1%
to 20% of practice revenue from man-
aged care (P.01). However, physi-
cians with 0% of revenue from man-
aged care were less likely to provide
charity care than physicians who de-
rived some revenue from managed care
plans (P.01). On the other hand, for
those physicians who provided some
charity care, those with no involvement
with managed care provided the high-
est number of hours. In addition, higher
managed care penetration at the site level
was associated with fewer charity care
hours (P.01), but did not have statis-
tically significant effects on the likeli-
hood of providing charity care.

of total practice revenue from managed
care provide about half as much charity
care as physicians who derive no rev-
enue from managed care and about 40%
less than physicians who derive 1% to
20% of practice revenue from managed
care. However, there is very little differ-
ence between physicians with 21% to
40%, 41% to 60%, and 61% to 84% of
practice revenue from managed care.
Thus, differences in overall charity care
provision occur primarily at the 2 ex-
tremes of managed care involvement.
Regardless of the physician's level of
involvement with managed care, those
who practice in areas with high man-
aged care penetration (defined as 2 SDs
above the average for all sites) provide
about 25% fewer hours of charity care
than physicians who practice in areas
with low managed care penetration (de-
fined as 2 SDs below the average), al-
though the differences by level of man-
aged care penetration in the market
appear smaller than differences in char-
ity care based on physician's practice rev-
enue.
COMMENT
Our results suggest that physicians who
are more heavily involved with man-
aged care plans and who practice in mar-
kets with high managed care penetra-
tion provide less charity care, perhaps
because greater financial pressures limit
their ability to cross-subsidize care for the
medically indigent by shifting the costs
onto third-party payers. However, it is
important to point out that this expla-
nation would reflect an unintended con-
sequence of the more aggressive cost-
control methods used by managed care
plans, rather than explicit and direct at-
tempts by managed care plans to limit
charity care provision. In other words,
any type of cost control (whether aris-
ing from the private market or public
policy decisions) could result in the same
behavioral response by physicians.
It is also important to note that the
causal mechanism attributed to these re-
sults--financial pressure--was not mea-
sured directly in this study. Further-
more, because the study was based on
cross-sectional rather than longitudinal
data, the results do not allow us to con-
clude with certainty that an increase in
managed care over time is resulting in a
decrease of physician charity care. There-
fore, alternative explanations for these
findings need to be considered.

A recent analysis suggests that be-
cause physicians who served a higher
number of uninsured persons were more
likely to be denied contracts with man-
aged care plans,26 these plans make de-
cisions about which physicians to con-
tract with or which markets to move into
heavily based in part on how much char-
ity care physicians provide. While our
survey did not include questions on ter-
minations or denials of contracts with
managed care plans, our data show that
physicians who provide a lot of charity
care do not have significantly fewer con-
tracts with managed care plans than phy-
sicians who provide less. Also, it is un-
clear why the relatively small amount of
charity care provided by an individual
physician would be a major concern to
managed care plans or how plans would
even know the extent of charity care be-
ing provided given the lack of data on
charity care.
One exception to the general trend was
that the small group of physicians who
did not have any involvement with man-
aged care plans were less likely to pro-

*Data are from the Community Tracking Study physician survey, 1996-1997. Expected values are derived from the
logistic regression analysis and the ordinary least squares regression analysis (Table 2). The predicted values from
the logistic regression equation were transformed back to the original scale to produce predicted probabilities of
providing charity care, while the predictions from the weighted least squares regressions (based on the log of the
number of charity care hours) were transformed back to their original scale using a smearing method to produce the
predicted number of charity care hours. For each cell in this table, the predicted probability was multiplied with the
predicted number of charity care hours to derive the overall average number of charity care hours.
Defined as the percentage of revenue from all managed care plans averaged across all physicians at a given site.
Average managed care penetration reflects the mean for all sites, low managed care penetration is based on 2 SDs
below the mean, and high managed care penetration is based on 2 SDs above the mean.

vide any charity care than physicians with
some managed care involvement, al-
though those who do provide some char-
ity care tend to provide more than phy-
sicians who are involved with managed
care. Additional analysis showed that
these physicians have been practicing
longer, are much more likely to be in solo
practice, work fewer hours, have lower
incomes, and are more likely to have
closed practices than other physicians in
our sample. It is possible that some of
these physicians prefer to keep their prac-
tices small and exclusive, are highly se-
lective about the patients they see, and
would prefer to avoid potential compli-
cations arising from managed care and
patients who lack the ability to pay.

tial effects of health system changes on

becausethelargerandmoreformalstruc-
turesofthesesettingsintentionallyorun-

tional barriers. In addition, "employed"
physicians may have less autonomy and
discretion in treating medically indigent
patients.
The results show that the relative num-
ber of uninsured persons in a commu-
nity (as a measure of the demand for
charity care) is not significantly related
to physician charity care, although it is
possible that the level of aggregation for
the measure (based on entire metropoli-
tan and nonmetropolitan areas) was too
large to detect any significant effects. Phy-
sician charity care may be more af-
fected by the level of demand closer to
their own practice (eg, the neighbor-
hood).
While findings for the effects of tra-
ditional safety net providers on physi-
cian charity care are incomplete because
of the absence of data on community
health centers and other free clinics, the
results do show that physicians tend to
provide more charity care in areas with
relatively fewer public hospitals or hos-
pitalemergencydepartments,whichsug-
gests that physicians do pick up some of
the excess demand for indigent care in
areaswheretheseprovidersarelesspreva-
lent. On the other hand, physicians tend
toprovidemorecharitycareinareaswith

siderable influence with the physician

prevalent, and this may help to encour-
age more of a community-wide commit-
ment to provide care to the medically
indigent.
Nevertheless, if cost pressures do re-
sult in less charity care provision by phy-
sicians, an additional consequence is that
more of the burden of providing indi-
gent care could be shifted onto the ma-
jor safety net providers, many of whom
are also struggling financially because of
health system changes. Increases in the
number of uninsured persons they serve
would severely strain their already lim-
ited resources for indigent care, which
could result in a reduction or rationing
of this kind of care. Thus, a signifi-
cantly decreased role in serving the un-
insured by private practice physicians
could negatively affect access to care for
the uninsured directly, as well as indi-
rectly because of the increased burden
on an already fragile safety net.

Osler Maneuver to Detect Pseudohypertension
To the Editor: Dr Chae and colleagues1 evaluated increased
pulse pressure as an independent risk of congestive heart fail-
ure in the elderly. However, the authors did not mention the
use of the Osler maneuver to differentiate true hypertension
from pseudohypertension. In pseudohypertension the cuff blood
pressure is inappropriately higher than the true intra-arterial
pressure because of excessive arteriosclerosis common in the
elderly.2,3
Although Osler4 described this phenomenon in 1892, it was
Messerli et al2 who in 1985 proposed the term "Osler's maneu-
ver" for the clinical detection of pseudohypertension. The Os-
ler maneuver is performed by palpating the pulseless radial or
brachial artery distal to the point of occlusion of the artery by
the sphygmomanometric cuff. When either of these arteries
remains palpable (despite being pulseless), the patient
is described as "Osler positive." In contrast, when either ar-
tery collapses and becomes impalpable, the patient is "Osler
negative."
In the study reported by Messerli et al,2 the patients with a
positive Osler maneuver had falsely elevated blood pressure read-
ings, with a difference of 10 to 54 mm Hg between cuff and
true intra-arterial pressures.2 Thus, depending on the number
of Osler-positive patients vs Osler-negative patients in the study
reported by Chae et al,1 the results and the conclusion could
be markedly different from those presented.

Century, 1892:668.
In Reply: Dr Cheng notes that the Osler maneuver was not
performed on the participants in our study. Pseudohyperten-
sion and the elevation in pulse pressure that occur with aging
both reflect the underlying pathology of progressive arterio-
sclerosis and stiffening of the arteries with age. In fact, Mes-
serli and colleagues1 found that arterial compliance, as mea-
sured by pulse wave velocity and pressure decay index, was
markedly increased in subjects who were Osler positive. Fur-
thermore, in the Osler-positive patients, the systolic and dias-
tolic pressures measured by sphygmomanometry were both
about 16 mm Hg higher than the true intra-arterial pressure.1
This resulted in falsely elevated mean arterial pressures but did
not affect pulse pressure. Therefore, we would not anticipate
that the importance of pulse pressure in our study would be
altered by whether subjects were Osler positive or negative. In-
deed, these observations would lend further support to the ad-
vantages of pulse pressure in providing additional useful prog-
nostic information.
