ABSTRACT
KRUGER, J., S. A. HAM, and H. W. KOHL III. Characteristics of a ``Weekend Warrior'': Results from Two National Surveys. Med.
Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 39, No. 5, pp. 796­800, 2007. Purpose: Little is known about high volumes of irregular weekly physical
activity, such as long periods of physical activity performed on weekends (e.g., by ``weekend warriors''). The purpose of this paper is to
describe the prevalence, estimated energy expenditure, and types of activities that are performed by adults who engage in irregular
patterns of physical activity (1­2 dIwkj1) with Q 150 minIwkj1 of total time spent in activity. Methods: Two national datasets were
analyzed to describe the proportion of the U.S. adult population who participate in irregular patterns of physical activity that are
equivalent in total volume to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American College of Sports Medicine
recommendations for physical activity, but with infrequent weekly participation. Data from the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System were used to classify weekend warriors as those who participate in 1­2 dIwkj1 of moderate-intensity and
vigorous-intensity physical activity totaling Q 150 minIwkj1. The 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was
used to describe participation in transportation, household, and sports and exercise by weekend warriors. Results: Approximately
1­3% of U.S. adults were classified as weekend warriors by both surveys. The median energy expenditure did not vary by sex.
Approximately 81% of weekend warriors participated in household or transportation activities, and 65% participated in sports or
exercise. Conclusions: These survey data indicate that relatively few adults participate in the weekend warrior pattern of activity on
1­2 dIwkj1 at volumes that approximate recommended levels. Key Words: EXERCISE, SPORTS, PHYSICAL FITNESS,
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Current U.S. physical activity (PA) guidelines
recommend at least 30 min of moderate-intensity
PA on most, preferably all, days of the week for
overall health benefits (17). Regularly performed aerobic
PA can increase fitness and reduce the risk of death from
cardiovascular disease, various cancers, and complications
of diabetes (22). Despite these public health recommenda-
tions, national data suggest that in 2003, only 45.9% of the
population engaged in regular activity that met the public
health recommendations (4). Moreover, a large proportion
of the population (39%) reported some activity, but not in
combinations of frequency, duration, and intensity equal to
or exceeding recommendations (11).
Epidemiological research suggests that the total amount
of energy expended in PA has an important bearing on
mortality rates (18). The rationale for recommending
activity on most days of the week is attributable to
evidence from early intervention studies that involved
exercise training over multiple days (7,21). The literature
suggests that certain risk factors such as blood pressure
(14) and depressive symptoms (6) respond more favorably
to more frequent bouts of aerobic PA. However, few
studies have been able to isolate the effect of physical
activity frequency for all-cause mortality (9).
Weekend warrior is a colloquial term used to describe
people who tend to compress their weekly activity into
long durations (i.e., 4-h hike, 3 h of yard work, or an
afternoon of basketball) on 1 or 2 dIwkj1. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that weekend warriors are common in
the U.S. population and that they may be at risk of future
injury (20). Only recently, in a paper by Lee et al. (8), has
the dose of the weekend warrior pattern been examined in
relation to health outcomes. To date, there is insufficient
evidence that an irregular PA pattern with an energy
expenditure comparable with the minimum PA recommen-
dations is associated with overall health benefits. Weekend
warriors are of interest to public health because they may
reap some health benefits by being physically active, but
they may be at a higher risk for chronic disease than those
who are regularly active. In addition, weekend warriors
may be receptive to increasing their PA frequency to
improve their cardiovascular health.

Little is known about the characteristics of adults who
engage in irregular patterns of PA at volumes that may be
equivalent to recommended levels. The purpose of this paper
is to describe the prevalence, estimated energy expenditure,
and types of activities performed by adults (Q 18 yr) who
engage in irregular patterns of PA (1­2 dIwkj1) with a total
time of Q 150 minIwkj1 spent in moderate- and vigorous-
intensity activity (i.e., weekend warriors).
METHODS
Survey descriptions. Data for this study were
obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) and the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). These two surveys
have been described elsewhere (5,13) and are briefly
summarized below. For the purpose of our study, two
complementary data sources were used to allow a more
complete description of weekend warriors.
The BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit­dialed tele-
phone survey of health risk behaviors in the civilian,
noninstitutionalized population in the United States. Data
are collected each year by all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. Self-reported data on moderate- and vigorous-
intensity leisure-time, household, and transportation-
related PA are reported in odd-numbered years. In 2003,
the sample size for 50 states and the District of Columbia
was 264,684 people, and the median response rate for those
states was 53.2%. In 2003, PA (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss)
was assessed from responses to six questions about the
frequency and duration of moderate- and vigorous-intensity
nonoccupational physical activity. Respondents were clas-
sified as weekend warriors if their summed frequencies of
moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity PA was 1 or 2 d and
if their summed durations totaled Q 150 minIwkj1 of
moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA. To estimate weekly
energy expenditure, moderate-intensity activities were
assigned a metabolic equivalent (MET) value of 3.0, and
vigorous-intensity activities were assigned 6.0 METs
according to the compendium of physical activities (1).
MET-minutes per week were calculated by multiplying the
MET value by the minutes per week of activity and
summing the moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity
MET-minutes per week.
Because the 2003 BRFSS does not include questions
on specific types of physical activities performed,
NHANES data were analyzed as part of this study to
provide additional descriptive details about PA patterns
among weekend warriors. The NHANES is an in-person
health interview and examination that collects information
on health conditions and risk factors. Data are collected
in 2-yr cycles from the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized
population. Survey questions about PA collected in three
cycles (1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004) were com-
parable in wording and methods and, therefore, were com-
bined to increase the sample size of adults aged Q 18 yr
(N = 31,126). To examine types of activities reported, we
analyzed survey data questions about transportation, house-
hold, sports, and leisure-time PA. Because the sample size
for each specific activity was small, we created two
categories: household/transportation-related activities, and
sports/exercise-related activities.
Data from the 1999­2004 NHANES (http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/guidelines1.pdf) were analyzed to identify
weekend warriors, using responses to 16 PA questions on
transportation, household, sports, and leisure-time activities.
In 1999­2000, the overall response rate for those inter-
viewed was 81.9%. In 2001­2002, the overall response
rate for those interviewed was 83.9%. In 2003­2004, the
overall response rate for those interviewed was 79.3%.
Transportation-related PA was defined as walking or
bicycling to work, school, or to do errands. Respondents
were asked about participation, frequency (i.e., how many
times per day, per week, or per month), and duration
(i.e., how many minutes or hours per day) of walking and
bicycling. The NHANES survey also included three ques-
tions about participation, frequency, and duration per
session of moderate-intensity household-related PA such as
gardening, yard work, or heavy cleaning. The question on
participation in vigorous-intensity leisure-time PA was,
``Over the past 30 d, did [you] do any vigorous activities
for at least 10 min that caused heavy sweating, or large
increases in breathing or heart rate?'' Respondents who
answered ``yes'' were then asked to report on the specific
sports and exercises from a list of 23 possible activities
(e.g., running, basketball, aerobic exercise). Respondents
were then asked how often and for how long they performed
each activity. Participation in moderate-intensity leisure-
time PA for at least 10 min per occasion, during the past
30 d, was evaluated in a similar manner. Respondents were
asked to report on the specific sports and exercises from a
list of 33 possible activities (e.g., hiking, walking, garden-
ing, yard work, or martial arts). Using the aforementioned
questions, respondents were classified as weekend warriors
if they answered ``yes'' to any of the questions and if they
reported participating in four to eight sessions of total
activity within the 30 d before the interview, for a total of
Q 600 min per month. We considered this to be equivalent
to one to two sessions per week and Q 150 minIwkj1 of
moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. To determine
participation in types of activities, data from questions
about household and transportation-related activities and
gardening and yard work that were reported as leisure-time
physical activities were combined into household and
transportation-related activities (e.g., gardening, yard work,
heavy cleaning, walking or bicycling for transportation),
and data from specific sports for either vigorous- or
moderate-intensity activities (e.g., jogging, walking) were
grouped as sports and exercise-related activities.
Statistical analysis. To demonstrate the compara-
bility of the surveys, sample characteristics for weekend
warriors were described by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and

education level for the BRFSS and the NHANES data as
sample sizes and weighted percents. Overall and sex-
specific prevalences of weekend warriors were reported
from the BRFSS and the NHANES data. Estimates of
energy expenditure (median and 25th and 75th percentiles)
were based on MET-minutes per week and were calculated
using the BRFSS data. Participation in activity domains
were reported for weekend warriors overall and by sex
from the NHANES data. Statistical significance of findings
was interpreted from degree of overlap in 95% confident
intervals. All analyses were conducted using SUDAAN
version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC, 2004) to account for the complex sample design
of each of the two surveys.
RESULTS
The demographic characteristics of weekend warriors
tended to vary by age, race/ethnicity, and education level
(Table 1). Sample age distributions varied from 12.3% in
the BRFSS for those aged 18­29 to 19.4% in the NHANES
for those aged 18­29. Weekend warriors were primarily
non-Hispanic white (64.7% in BRFSS; 74.7% in NHANES).
The distribution of demographic characteristics of weekend
warriors in the BRFSS was similar to that in the NHANES.
Overall, approximately 1% of adults were classified
as weekend warriors according to BRFSS data, and ap-
proximately 3% were weekend warriors according to
NHANES data (Fig. 1). In both surveys, more men than
women were classified as weekend warriors. Among
weekend warriors, the distribution of sex by age is shown
in Figure 2 from the BRFSS. The prevalence of this pattern
is highest among those aged 45­64 and is lowest among
those aged 18­24.
From the BRFSS, the estimated median energy expendi-
ture for those classified as weekend warriors was 1079
METIminIwkj1. The estimated energy expenditure re-
ported by weekend warriors did not vary by sex (Table 2).
From the NHANES analyses, household/transportation
or sports/exercise activities were frequently reported by
weekend warriors (Fig. 3). Approximately 81% of weekend
warriors engaged in purposeful activities such as garden-
ing, yard work, and walking and/or bicycling for trans-
portation. Approximately 65% of weekend warriors

participated in sports and exercise. A greater proportion of
men than women participated in sports/exercise-related
activities (P G 0.001).
DISCUSSION
This study suggests that approximately 1­3% of U.S.
adults may be weekend warriors--adults who participate in
PA patterns that may be equivalent to recommended levels
in terms of total volume but that are accomplished on 1 or
2 dIwkj1. The national prevalence was less than expected
in light of anecdotal evidence suggesting that occupational
constraints and lack of leisure time lead to difficulty in
scheduling physical activity during the workday (12,19).
According to BRFSS data, this pattern of activity is highest
among those aged 45­64--an age group that often
experiences time constraints from having to care for
children as well as parents, in addition to large occupa-
tional time requirements.
It cannot be determined from these data whether
the same volume of PA achieved through infrequent bouts
(1­2 dIwkj1) or regular activity (Q 5 dIwkj1) has different
health effects. The estimated energy expenditure for those
classified as weekend warriors may be sufficient to confer
some of the health benefits of regular PA. We found that
weekend warriors had an estimated median energy expen-
diture of 1079 METIminIwkj1, and Brown and Miller (3)
suggest that at least 525 METIminIwkj1 are needed to meet
PA recommendations for health (e.g., 30 min of moderate
intensity on five or more days per week). Lee et al.
(8) found that healthy men who were physically active only
1­2 dIwkj1 with an energy expenditure of 1000 kcalIwkj1
(equivalent to Q 150 minIwkj1 of moderate-intensity PA)
had reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared with
sedentary men. However, the same study found that men
with any risk factors for chronic disease who engaged in
this PA pattern did not have a reduced risk of all-cause
mortality, whereas those whose energy expenditure met the
recommendations had a reduced risk of mortality.
In our study, we found that a large proportion of weekend
warriors participate in household/transportation-related activi-
ties and sports/exercise-related activities. Because studies
have shown that household activities such as home repair and
gardening are associated with health benefits (10,15), and
because these activities are often performed in intermittent
bouts and on weekends, future research comparing the
conditioning response and health effects gained from
household versus leisure-time activity is needed. One study
found that engaging in two consecutive days of walking or
running as endurance training for 75 minIdj1 (e.g., weekend
warriors) compared with 30 minIdj1 of similar activities
performed on 5 d at the same intensity produces a similar
training effect on V
 O2max
(12). Although not significant, the
cumulative training effect was slightly lower for those who
engaged in more frequent bouts of endurance training for a
shorter duration than it was for the weekend warriors. Future
research is needed to compare the health benefits gained by
participation in activities of low intensity (e.g., golf) (16)
versus more strenuous activities (e.g., basketball, yard work)
(2) among weekend warriors.
The results of this analysis are subject to several
limitations. First, data from both the BRFSS and NHANES
are self-reported, and physical activity levels may be
underestimated. Additionally, these datasets were not
specifically designed to study weekend warrior behavior.
Second, the survey questions did not specifically ask
respondents to report the actual day(s) of the week they
engaged in activity (i.e., weekday or weekend); therefore,
we conducted the analysis on the basis of the frequency of
activity (i.e., 1­2 dIwkj1; four to eight sessions per month),
and we cannot verify whether activities were performed on
the weekend, or whether multiple activities were per-
formed on the same day or different days. Moreover,
there were different sample frames in the questions used
(i.e., BRFSS measured times in the past week, and
NHANES measured times in the past 30 d), which may
introduce bias when comparing the surveys. Third, the
NHANES sample was small, limiting the subgroup
analyses that could be performed. Furthermore, NHANES
asked respondents to report on 23 questions about sports
and exercise activities, possibly leading to reporting of
more PA. Fourth, our computation of MET-minutes per
week was based on the absolute MET-value activity codes
in the compendium of physical activities (1), and we
classified total energy expenditure for moderate- and
vigorous-intensity at the low end of each intensity range
without adjusting for respondents` age. Because many
activities can be performed at multiple intensities, respond-
ents could have reported time spent in moderate-intensity
activity when light-intensity activity had been performed.
FIGURE 3--Participation among weekend warriors in household
and transportation-related activities and sports and exercise
(NHANES 1999­2004). Weekend warrior refers to participation in
four to eight sessions of transportation, household, moderate- and
vigorous-intensity leisure-time activity (e.g., sports and exercise) in the
past 30 d, totaling Q 600 min per month. Household and transportation
activities refers to respondents reporting that they engaged in one or
more of the following activities: household activities reported as
leisure-time PA (e.g., gardening, yard work), walking/biking for
transportation, or moderate-intensity household tasks (e.g., raking
leaves, mowing the lawn, heavy cleaning). Sports and exercise refers to
moderate- or vigorous-intensity leisure-time activity, such as various
sport activities, or walking for exercise.

Important strengths of this study include the use of two
national surveys with somewhat similar questions on PA,
allowing for comparison of national estimates between
surveys and a more detailed descriptive analysis of week-
end warriors than would have been possible using only one
survey. Specifically, the NHANES included questions on
specific types of activities; this was not part of the BRFSS
survey.
In summary, roughly 1­3% of the U.S. population engages
in irregular patterns of PA (i.e., 1­2 dIwkj1) that approxi-
mate PA recommendations in terms of volume of activity,
and more men than women have this activity pattern.
Among men and women, the distribution of this pattern is
highest among those aged 45­64. The types of PA reported
by weekend warriors include household and transportation
activities, such as gardening, yard work, and sports, or
exercise. More research is needed to help further describe
the activity patterns and trends in these individuals.
