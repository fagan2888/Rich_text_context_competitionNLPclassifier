Are adolescents with high socioeconomic status
more likely to engage in alcohol and illicit drug
use in early adulthood?
Jennifer L Humensky
Abstract
Background: Previous literature has shown a divergence by age in the relationship between socioeconomic status
(SES) and substance use: adolescents with low SES are more likely to engage in substance use, as are adults with
high SES. However, there is growing evidence that adolescents with high SES are also at high risk for substance
abuse. The objective of this study is to examine this relationship longitudinally, that is, whether wealthier
adolescents are more likely than those with lower SES to engage in substance use in early adulthood.
Methods: The study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), a
longitudinal, nationally-representative survey of secondary school students in the United States. Logistic regression
models were analyzed examining the relationship between adolescent SES (measured by parental education and
income) and substance use in adulthood, controlling for substance use in adolescence and other covariates.
Results: Higher parental education is associated with higher rates of binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine use in
early adulthood. Higher parental income is associated with higher rates of binge drinking and marijuana use. No
statistically significant results are found for crystal methamphetamine or other drug use. Results are not sensitive to
the inclusion of college attendance by young adulthood as a sensitivity analysis. However, when stratifying by race,
results are consistent for white non-Hispanics, but no statistically significant results are found for non-whites. This
may be a reflection of the smaller sample size of non-whites, but may also reflect that these trends are driven
primarily by white non-Hispanics.
Conclusions: Previous research shows numerous problems associated with substance use in young adults,
including problems in school, decreased employment, increases in convictions of driving under the influence (DUI)
and accidental deaths. Much of the previous literature is focused on lower SES populations. Therefore, it is possible
that teachers, parents and school administrators in wealthier schools may not perceive as great to address
substance abuse treatment in their schools. This study can inform teachers, parents, school administrators and
program officials of the need for addressing drug abuse prevention activities to this population of students.
Background
The relationship between childhood socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) and behavioral health in adulthood has long
been of interest to researchers and policymakers. A few
studies have found that adolescents with low SES have a
greater propensity toward substance use during adoles-
cence. Goodman and Huang [1], studying the first wave
of AddHealth data cross-sectionally, found that having
low SES was associated with greater alcohol use and
with greater cigarette and cocaine use among white
teenagers. Goodman and colleagues [2] found that lower
household income and parental education were asso-
ciated with greater adolescent depression. Friestad and
colleagues [3] found that low parental education and
moderate household income was associated with greater
rates of smoking in adolescents. Reinherz and colleagues
[4], examining 360 respondents followed from 1977-
2000, found that low family SES and larger family size
were associated with increased probability of substance
abuse disorders in early adulthood. An analysis by

Hamilton and colleagues [5], of the Ontario Student
Drug Use Survey, found that adolescents (ages 12-19)
with college-educated parents were less likely to engage
in hazardous or harmful drinking or illicit drug use.
However, there is growing evidence that adolescents
with higher SES may also be at risk for developing sub-
stance use disorders. There is evidence that substance
use in adults, particularly alcohol use, may be sensitive
to price, as some studies have shown that consumption
decreases as price increases [6-9]. For adolescents with
higher SES, having greater financial resources may indi-
cate that the relative cost of substance use, that is the
opportunity cost of substance use relative to other con-
sumption, may be lower than for adolescents with lower
SES. This is consistent with the usual demand model for
goods and services, and could indicate a higher demand
among wealthier adolescents. This was found in a 2007
study of British adolescents by Bellis and colleagues,
which found that adolescents with more spending
money were more likely to drink frequently, binge drink
and to drink in public [10], as well as in a study of col-
lege students in the United States, which found that col-
lege students with lower levels of spending money had
lower levels of drinking and getting drunk [11],
Engagement in substance use can have negative impli-
cations for young adults. Previous research has shown
that substance use at young ages is associated with
decreased educational attainment [12,13] and labor mar-
ket productivity [14,15]. Binge drinking in particular has
been linked to driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI) and accidental deaths in college-age students [16].
As illicit drugs are illegal in the United States, the use
of these substances places young adults at risk of invol-
vement in the criminal justice system. Thus, substance
use can have substantial negative consequences for
young adults. However, as much previous literature has
focused on the substance use of lower income adoles-
cents [1-5], it is possible that parents, teachers, policy-
makers and program administrators may be less focused
on the possible long-term implications of substance use
on adolescents with higher SES [17-19].
The purpose of this study is to examine whether ado-
lescents with high SES, as measured by parental educa-
tion and income, are more likely to engage in alcohol
and illicit drug use in early adulthood, using a prospec-
tive, nationally-representative sample of secondary
school students in the United States. This expands upon
the work of Bellis and colleagues [10], who examined
cross-sectional data on alcoholism in the United King-
dom and Martin and colleagues [11], who examined
prevalence of alcohol use among college students in the
United States. As much of the previous literature has
focused on adolescents with lower SES, the findings of
this study could help parents, teachers and practitioners
to identify students who may be at risk for future sub-
stance use and educational problems.
Methods
Data
The data comes from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). The first wave of
AddHealth was conducted in 1994-1995, and consisted
of a nationally representative sample of school students
in grades 7-12 in the United States. The sample was a
school-based cluster design, which was selected to
ensure a nationally representative population, by region,
urbanicity, racial and ethnic composition, school type,
and school size [20].
A total of 20,745 students completed the in-home
interview. Parents of students who were selected for the
in-home interview were also interviewed. The third
wave of the study, which followed-up respondents from
the Wave I interview, was completed in 2001-02, when
respondents were 18-27 years old. A few respondents
(72 students) with mental retardation were excluded
from the sample, as their educational trajectories are
likely to differ from those of their peers.
Estimation Models
The estimation models examine the relationship between
adolescent SES and subsequent use of alcohol and illicit
drugs, controlling for baseline use of alcohol and illicit
drugs and mental health (depressive symptoms, delin-
quency and suicidality) and a set of other individual,
family school and neighborhood characteristics.
The outcome variables of interest are binge drinking
and illicit drug use in early adulthood. AddHealth asks
respondents separately about their use of alcohol, mari-
juana, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine and any other
drug use. As the use of these substances is measured
separately in AddHealth, they are analyzed separately in
these analyses. Substance use was measured as a binary
indicator of use, as previous research has found that
responders tend to report accurately whether they con-
sume substances, but tend to under-report the amount
consumed [6]. Sensitivity analyses found that results
were qualitatively similar when examining a continuous
measure of use (not shown).
The key independent variable was socioeconomic status
at baseline, as measured by parental education and
income. As these were assessed separately in AddHealth,
they are analyzed separately in these analyses as well. The
parents' socioeconomic status reflects the economic status
of the family in which the adolescent resides at baseline.
Previous research has shown that parental socioeconomic
status reflects the child's socioeconomic status [21]. The
highest educated parent was used rather than the educa-
tion level of the mother and father to avoid losing

respondents living in single parent families [22]. House-
hold income was also included as a separate measure of
SES, as household income captures smaller gradations in
family well-being than parental income [23].
A number of the adolescent's baseline personal char-
acteristics were also included in the model. The adoles-
cent's baseline binge drinking and illicit drug use was
included in the model in order that these models mea-
sure change in substance use from baseline to follow-up
in early adulthood. In addition, other behavioral health
factors at baseline were controlled for, including delin-
quency, suicidality and depressive symptoms, due to the
high rates of comorbidity of mental health diagnoses
among persons with substance abuse [24].
A number of demographic variables were also
included in the model, including age, gender, and race/
ethnicity. Additional individual characteristics that have
been shown to be correlated with educational attain-
ment were included, such the Peabody Picture Vocabu-
lary (PPVT) score, which measures cognitive ability [25],
and general health, which measures physical health and
may account for endogeneity between mental health and
labor market outcomes [26,27].
A number of family background variables were also
included in the model. An indicator of whether the
respondent was the first child born in the family was
included, as previous research has shown that children
born first in the family tend to have better educational
outcomes [28]. Family structure (single parent household,
stepfamily and foster/other) is included, as children from
non-traditional families often face barriers to schooling
[29]. An indicator for whether the respondent's biological
mother and father have alcoholism is included as alcohol-
ism has a high genetic component [30].

Where:
pi,t+1
= Probability of substance use at Wave III, as
measured by binge drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use,
crystal methamphetamine use and other drug use, esti-
mated separately. Binge drinking was measured as a bin-
ary variable with a positive value indicating 5 or more
drinks in one setting more than once a month in the
past year. Marijuana, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine
and other drug use was measured as a binary variable
with a positive value indicating any use in the past 30
days.
SESi
= Socioeconomic status at baseline, as measured
by parental education and household income. Parental
education was measured by the education level of the
highest educated parent living with the adolescent, and
was categorized by the highest educated parent having
not completed high school, having completed high
school only, having education beyond high school but
less than a college degree, or having a college degree.
Household income was measured continuously and was
topcoded in AddHealth at $999,000, so reported income
ranged from $0-$999,000.
BHi
= A number of behavioral health (mental health
and substance use) characteristics at baseline in adoles-
cence (Wave I interview) were included in the model:
binge drinking, marijuana, cocaine, inhalant and other
drug use at baseline, as well as depressive symptoms,
delinquency and suicidality. Each of these components
was included separately in the model. As with the out-
come variables, binge drinking in adolescence was mea-
sured as a binary variable with a positive value
indicating 5 or more drinks in one setting more than
once a month in the past year. Marijuana, cocaine, inha-
lant and other drug use was measured as a binary vari-
able with a positive value indicating any use of these
substances in the past 30 days. Depressive symptoms are
measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression scale (CES-D) [31,32]. Delinquency is a scale
of 0-12 of criminal behaviors in the past year [33]. Sui-
cidality is measured by a binary variable with a positive
value indicating a suicide attempt in the past year.
Xi
= A number of individual and family characteristics
included as control variables. These include demo-
graphic variables such as gender, age, age squared
(to account for non-linearities in age), and race/ethnicity
[34]. Race/ethnicity categories are defined as Hispanic
or white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Asian non-
Hispanic, or other race, non-Hispanic. The Peabody Pic-
ture vocabulary test score is measured on a continuous
scale, and is standardized so that the mean is approxi-
mately 100. General health is categorized as excellent,
very good, good, or fair/poor. Family structure is cate-
gorized as two biological parents, single parent house-
hold, stepfamily or foster/other family. A binary
indicator indicates whether the adolescent is the first
born in the family, and whether the adolescent has a
biological mother or father with alcoholism.
These equations were analyzed using Stata 10.0. Logit
models were analyzed because the outcome variables of
interest were dichotomized, and odds ratios are reported
in the tables. The research protocol was approved by
the University of Chicago Social and Behavioral Sciences
Institutional Review Board (#H06238).
Missing Observations
A total of 20,745 students completed the AddHealth in-
home interview, and of these, 15,170 followed up at
Wave III. There is thus attrition as well as item non-
response. Item non-response is particularly problematic
for the items asked of parents, parental income and

alcoholism. The final sample, with no missing observa-
tions, was 9,872. Therefore, sample loss is a concern.
This was addressed using re-weighting and imputation
measures. Results were qualitatively similar under re-
weighting and imputation, and so the results presented
here use the AddHealth's weights and original sample to
allow for greater replicability. The full detail is provided
in Additional file 1.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics. In adolescence, the
average household income was about $46,000 at the
time of baseline data collection (1994-1995). In about 9
percent of households, the highest educated resident
parent did not complete high school. In about 34 per-
cent of households, the highest educated resident parent
had a college education.
About 25 percent engaged in binge drinking in early
adulthood (Wave III), about 24 percent engaged in mar-
ijuana use, about 4 percent engaged in cocaine use, one
percent in crystal methamphetamine use, and about 5
percent in other drug use.
Regression Results
Table 2 shows the regression results examining the
association between SES in adolescence and subsequent
substance use in early adulthood. Higher parental edu-
cation is associated with higher odds of binge drinking,
marijuana use and cocaine use. For an individual with a
college-educated parent, the odds of binge drinking in
early adulthood are 1.458 times as large as the odds for
an individual with a high school-educated parent once
all controls are included in the model (AOR = 1.458,
95% CI [1.190-1.788]). Likewise, for an individual with a
college-educated parent, the odds of engaging in mari-
juana use in early adulthood are 1.265 times as large as
the odds for an individual with a high school-educated
parent (AOR = 1.265, 95% CI [1.038-1.541]). The odds
of engaging in cocaine use in early adulthood are 1.614
times as large for an individual with a college-educated
parent versus a high school-educated parent (AOR =
1.614, 95% CI [1.088-2.395]). No statistically significant
effects are found for crystal methamphetamine and
other drug use.
Table 3 shows the regression results examining the
association between SES as measured by household
income in adolescence and substance use in early adult-
hood. Higher household income is associated with
higher probability of binge drinking and marijuana use.
An additional $1000 in annual household income in
adolescence is associated with an increase of 1.003 in
the odds of binge drinking in early adulthood (AOR =
1.003, 95% CI [1.001-1.004]). It should be noted that
this result, while statistically significant, is quite small.
Likewise, an additional $1000 in annual income in ado-
lescence is associated with an increase of 1.002 in the
odds of marijuana use in early adulthood (AOR = 1.002,
95% CI [1.000-1.003]), and an increase of 1.002 in the
odds of cocaine use, though the results for cocaine use
lose statistical significance once controls are added
to the model (OR = 1.002, 95% CI [1.000-1.004], AOR =
1.002, 95% CI [0.999-1.004]). No statistically significant
results are found for crystal methamphetamine or other
drug use.
Sensitivity Analyses
Tables 4 and 5 show sensitivity analyses. Table 4 shows
the results when college attendance in young adulthood
(by Wave III) is included in the model. It should be
noted that the prospective nature of the model is vio-
lated in this sensitivity analysis, as an independent vari-
able, college attendance, is measured at Wave III, as is
the outcome variable. Still, this analysis is useful in
examining whether the relationships seen in Tables 2
and 3 are simply functions of college attendance. It is
possible that wealthier young adults are more likely to
attend college, and thus to be living near peers who are
engaging in substance use, particularly alcohol and mari-
juana use. College attendance by Wave III is measured
by enrollment or graduation from a two or four year
college at the Wave III interview.
The results show that the relationships seen above are
robust to the inclusion of college attendance. Persons
with higher parental education (as measured in adoles-
cence) have a higher probability of binge drinking (joint
test p < 0.01), marijuana (joint test p < 0.01) and cocaine
use (joint test approaching significance at p < 0.10), when
controlling for college attendance. In addition, higher
household income in adolescence is associated with a
higher probability of binge drinking (AOD = 1.003, 95%
CI [1.000-1.004]), marijuana use (AOD = 1.002, 95% CI
[1.000-1.003]), and cocaine use (AOD = 1.002, 95% CI
[1.000-1.004]) in early adulthood when college atten-
dance is controlled for. No statistically significant results
were found for crystal methamphetamine or other drug
use. The results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that
the higher rates of binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine
use are not solely the result of greater college attendance.
Table 5 stratifies results by race, white non-Hispanic
versus non-whites. Although results for white non-His-
panics are qualitatively similar to the results in Table 2
for the whole population, none of the results for the
non-whites are statistically significant. This may be a
function of the smaller sample size (n = 5580 for whites
and n = 4292 for non-whites). It may also be that the
results found are being driven primarily by white
adolescents.

Discussion
The results from this study indicate that higher SES in
adolescence, as measured by parental education and
household income in adolescence, is associated with
higher rates of substance use, particularly binge drink-
ing, marijuana use and cocaine use, in early adulthood.
No statistically significant results were found for crystal
methamphetamine or other drug use. Results were
consistent when controlling for college attendance by
young adulthood as a sensitivity analysis. When stratify-
ing by race, results were consistent for white non-Hispa-
nics, but no significant results were found for non-
whites. This may be a function of a smaller sample size
of the non-white sample, or it may be that the results
are driven primarily by white non-Hispanic respondents.
In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed while

were qualitatively similar (not shown).
Previous literature has shown that the relationships
between SES and substance use vary by age. The results in
this paper are somewhat contrary to previous literature in
youth which has shown that lower SES is associated with
higher rates of substance use problems [1-5]. However, the
results of this study are consistent with previous research
in adults, which found that demand for illicit substances is
price sensitive [6-9], and thus predicts that substance use
will increase as income is higher. This therefore indicates
that the behavior of young adults more closely reflects that

of adults rather than that of youth. The results are also
consistent with Bellis and colleagues [10], who found that
adolescents with more spending money reported greater
substance use and with Martin and colleagues [11], who
found that college students with more spending money
engaged in greater alcohol use. This study provides addi-
tional evidence for these earlier findings in a longitudinal,
nationally-representative sample of adolescents in the Uni-
ted States, and in illicit substances in addition to alcohol
use. In addition, it is possible that parental education may
have a distinct influence on subsequent college attendance
by the adolescent, distinct from general socioeconomic sta-
tus. Parents with higher education may have a greater
influence on their adolescent's choice to attend college, as
the inter-generational transfer of education has been well-
established in previous literature [34]. It is possible that
this college attendance could in turn provide greater
opportunities for substance use [35]. However, the rela-
tionships observed in this study were found for both mea-
sures of SES, parental education and household income,
indicating that these relationships were consistent across
measures and not limited to parental education.
Several limitations to this study must be noted.
AddHealth is an observational study, not a randomized
control trial, thus causality is difficult to establish with cer-
tainty. However, the longitudinal nature of this analysis
helps somewhat to address this issue. Sample loss due to
attrition and item non-response is also problematic.
Details of how this was addressed were discussed in the
Methods section and in Additional file 1. Additionally, the
outcome variables measure self-reported substance use,
rather than clinically-diagnosed substance abuse or depen-
dence. It should be noted that AddHealth is a nationally-
representative sample of US secondary school students at
the time of data collection, and thus does not capture ado-
lescents who are not enrolled in school. It also does not
offer extensive data on early childhood, as data collection
begins when participants are in grades 7-12 at Wave I.
Despite its limitations, the AddHealth data allows for a
longitudinal analysis of the relationship between SES in
adolescence and subsequent substance use in early adult-
hood. The richness of the AddHealth data allows for the
consideration of a number of facets of SES and use of a
wide range of substances. It also includes a large set of
individual, family, school and community characteristics
assessed at baseline, including substance use and mental
health at baseline. This paper contributes to the under-
standing of the relationship between adolescent SES and
subsequent substance use, which can help educators, par-
ents and policymakers to identify adolescents who may be
at risk of substance abuse contemporaneously and in the
future.
Conclusions
This study examines the relationship between adolescent
SES and subsequent substance use in early adulthood.
The association varies somewhat by the type of sub-
stance used. Higher adolescent SES, as measured by

parental education and household income in adoles-
cence, is associated with higher rates of binge drinking,
marijuana and cocaine use in early adulthood. No statis-
tically significant results were found for crystal metham-
phetamine or other drug use.
Previous research has shown that substance use can lead
to numerous problems for young adults, including difficul-
ties in school, in the labor market, and in the criminal jus-
tice system. As much of the previous scientific literature
often focuses on substance abuse in lower SES populations
[1-5,17-19], it is possible that teachers and school adminis-
trators in wealthier schools may be less likely to recognize
the need for substance abuse treatment programs, if the
current policy focus is on lower SES populations. Likewise,
administrators of drug abuse prevention programs may be
less likely to focus their efforts in higher-income areas.
This study offers evidence that wealthier students may be
at risk for substance use problems in the future, particu-
larly for binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine use. As pre-
vious evidence shows that students with more spending
money might be more likely to engage in substance use
into adulthood, access to allowances and other forms of
spending money may be issues that parents can address if
they are concerned with the possibility of substance abuse
among their children. School administrators seeking to
identify substance use education policies in their schools
can find a listing of programs shown to be effective on the
website for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
[36]. Examining the substance abuse problems facing stu-
dents with higher SES can help teachers, school adminis-
trators, and parents recognize the needs that may be
present in their schools and communities, and the need for
programs to effectively address substance use.
