Infections: Results From the 2001­2004 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
Jenifer E. Allsworth, PHD, Jane Alyce Ratner, BS, and Jeffrey F. Peipert, MD, PHD
Background: To estimate the association between Trichomonas vagi-
nalis infection (TV) and 6 sexually transmitted infections: chlamydia,
gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus (Types 1 and 2), syphilis, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a nationally representative sample.
Methods: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey combining the 2001­2002 and 2003­2004 waves
to estimate the association between TV and sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STIs) among women in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US
population. The final sample included data from 3648 women, which
when weighted, represents the experience of 65,563,298 US women
between the ages of 14 and 49. Crude and adjusted relative risks were
estimated using logistic regression for rare STIs (10%; chlamydia,
syphilis, and HIV) and Poisson regression for common STIs (herpes
simplex virus [HSV] Types 1 and 2). Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using Stata (version 9.2).
Results: The prevalence of trichomoniasis was 3.2% with over 80%
of cases asymptomatic in the past month. All STIs examined (chla-
mydia, gonorrhea, HSV-1, HSV-2, syphilis, and HIV) were more
common among women with a positive test for trichomoniasis. HSV-1
(RR  1.20, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.34) and HSV-2 (RR  1.51, 95% CI:
2.32, 3.23) were significantly associated with trichomoniasis after
adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, and recent sexual partners. In crude
analyses, a positive treponemal test was 6 times (95% CI: 2.07, 18.8)
more common and HIV was 13 times (95% CI: 2.88, 59.1) more
common among women with trichomoniasis, but these estimates were
greatly attenuated after adjustment for potential confounders.
Conclusion: Trichomoniasis is significantly associated with concur-
rent STI.
Trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
caused by the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), is the
most common curable STI in young, sexually active women.1
Estimates from 2001 to 2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 3.1% of women in
the United States have TV making it more common than
gonorrhea and chlamydia combined.2 Another nationally rep-
resentative study found that 2.8% of women 18 to 26 years
were positive for trichomoniasis.3 Trichomoniasis was more
common in black women with a prevalence ranging from
10.5% to 13%,2,3 as well as in women who had not received
education beyond high school (6.3%) and those living below
the poverty level (5.4%).2 TV infections differ from other STIs
in that the prevalence increases with increasing age among
women under the age of 50.2
Trichomoniasis has often been considered a relatively be-
nign infection, but given its association with other STIs, particu-
larly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and preterm delivery
it is an important public health problem.3­6 For example, Kle-
banoff et al found that treatment of TV during pregnancy signif-
icantly reduced active infection, but did not reduce preterm
delivery and, in fact, may have been associated with an increased
risk of preterm delivery.7 Disentangling whether these associa-
tions are causal or simply the result of confounding by high risk
sexual behaviors or other risk factors is essential.
Coinfection of TV with other STIs is common; associ-
ations between TV infection and chlamydia, gonorrhea, syph-
ilis, and herpes simplex virus-Type 2 (HSV-2) have been
described.3,8­10 The correlation between increased risk of HIV
transmission and TV infection has been well supported by the
literature. HIV appears to be transmitted more easily with TV
infection; studies have shown that treatment of TV reduces
viral shedding11,12 and potentially HIV transmission. Despite
the risks associated with TV infection, trichomoniasis is not a
reportable disease and often is not included in routine testing
(although may be detected during routine Pap testing).13
In this study, we examined the cross-sectional associa-
tion between TV and 6 STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HSV
Types 1 and 2, syphilis and HIV. Our analyses used the
2001­2004 NHANES data. We hypothesized that other STIs
would be associated with the presence of trichomoniasis even
after controlling for important confounding factors among a
representative sample of reproductive aged women.

among women in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion. NHANES was designed to obtain nationally representa-
tive information on the health and nutritional status of the
population of the United States through interviews and direct
physical examinations. Methods describing this survey have
been published elsewhere.14 This study was approved by the
Washington University School of Medicine Human Research
Protection Office.
Trichomoniasis. Vaginal swabs were collected for the
detection of T. vaginalis. Detection was completed by perform-
ing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with primers from
a region of the 18S rRNA gene that produces a 312 base pair
product. A sample was considered positive if it yielded a 102
base pair fragment after PCR amplification that was recognized
by the Trichomonas-specific DNA probe upon Southern blot
hybridization. A small percentage of swabs (2%) were catego-
rized as not interpretable if both trichomonas and -globulin
were negative. The sensitivity and specificity for this test both
exceed 97%.15
Chlamydia. Urine samples were analyzed for the pres-
ence of Chlamydia trachomatis via assay with ligase chain
reaction TM amplification technology in the LCx Probe Sys-
tem. Urine specimens were required to be first catch and
specimens that were moderately bloody or grossly mucoid were
unacceptable.16 The sensitivity and specificity of this test using
urine samples from women were 80.5% and 98.4%.17
Neisseria gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae was evaluated
from the same urine sample as chlamydia. This assay used
ligase chain reaction TM amplification technology in the LCx
Probe System for the direct, qualitative detection of a specific
target nucleic acid sequence in the opa gene of N. gonor-
rhoeae.16 The sensitivity and specificity of this test using urine
samples from women were 84.9% and 99.4%.17
Syphilis. Multiple approaches were used for the detec-
tion of syphilis. The Captia Syphilis-G enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) was used as an indirect method for the detection of IgG
antibodies to Treponema pallidum. If positive or equivocal, the
rapid plasma reagin (RPR) was used to screen for syphilis. The
Serodia TP-PA test detected antibodies to the various species
and subspecies of pathogenic Treponema. In this analysis, a test
was positive if there was evidence recent or remote infection
(positive or equivocal EIA plus one of the following: RPR, 8
or RPR, 0­8 and TP-PA, positive).18 The sensitivity of the
Captia Syphilis-G EIA test is excellent (98.3%).19 Additionally,
a recent study found 97.7% agreement with the microhemag-
glutination assay for T. pallidum.20
HIV. Specimens were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2
antibodies using the Synthetic Peptide Enzyme Immunoassay.
Specimens that were reactive in both tests were tested with the
Cambridge Biotech HIV-1 Western Blot Kit (Calypte Biomed-
ical Corporation, Rockville, MD). If the EIA and Western Blots
results did not agree, the Western result was used.21
HSV-1 and HSV-2. Viral glycoproteins specific for
HSV-2 (designated gG-2) and HSV-1 (designated gG-1) have
been identified. Solid-phase enzymatic immunodot assays were
used to detect antibodies reactive to these antigens,22 which has
demonstrated good sensitivity and discriminates HSV-1 and
HSV-2.23 Serum samples testing positive for HSV-2 in the
immunodot assay were further confirmed by a gG-2 monoclo-
nal antibody inhibition assay.24
Potential Confounders. We examined a number of
potential confounders including sociodemographic characteris-
tics and reproductive and sexual history. Confounders were
identified via prior published associations or significant asso-
ciations (P 0.05) in univariate regression models. Age was
included as a confounder due to prior published evidence of an
association. Self-reported sociodemographic characteristics in-
cluded in these analyses included: age (14­19, 20­29, 30­39,
and 40­49), race/ethnicity (white, non-Hispanic; black, non-
Hispanic, Mexican American; or other race/other Hispanic),
birthplace (United States, Mexico, or elsewhere), marital status
(married; divorced, widowed or separated; never married; or
living with a partner), education (high school, completed
high school (or GED), high school), and poverty/income ratio
( federal poverty level [PIR: 1[, PIR: 1­2, or PIR: 2).
Reproductive history variables included: age at first in-
tercourse, STI history, use of hormonal birth control, pregnancy
history, douching, and vaginal symptoms in the past month.
Age at first menstruation was categorized as 7 to 11, 12 to 14,
15 years or later, or unknown. Douching was defined as any
douching within the past 1 or 6 months and vaginal problems
were defined as any itching, odor, or discharge in the last
month. History of self-reported STI was defined 2 ways: (1)
lifetime diagnosis genital herpes or warts or (2) diagnosis of
gonorrhea or chlamydia in the last 12 months. A limitation of
the NHANES dataset is that it did not include questions on
lifetime history of gonorrhea or chlamydia. Hormonal birth
control was defined as ever used birth control pills, injectable
contraception, or other female hormonal contraception. Preg-
nancy history was described as ever pregnant, currently preg-
nant, or self-reported delivery of a low-birth weight infant
(5.5 pounds). NHANES also collects information on pre-
scription medication use in the last month using a medication
inventory method. We created an antibiotic use variable that
was defined as any antibiotic recommended for treatment of
any of the STIs analyzed in this study (amoxicillin, ampicillin,
azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, levo-
floxacin, metronidazole, ofloxacin, or penicillin).
Women who were 14 to 49 years also completed a
sexual history questionnaire that included questions on history
of sexual intercourse, lifetime, and last year sexual partners.
However, due to confidentiality concerns, sexual history data
for individuals between the ages of 14 and 19 years are only
available at the National Center for Health Statistics Research
Data Center. Therefore, all analyses including these variables
were limited to women who were 20 to 49 years.
Statistical Methods
Categorical data were compared using  square tests.
Odds ratios for associations with trichomoniasis and potential
confounders were estimated using logistic regression. Crude
and adjusted relative risks for the association of individual STIs
and trichomoniasis were estimated using logistic regression for
rare STIs (10%; chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV) and Poisson
regression with robust error variance for common STIs (HSV 1
and 2).25 Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (ver-
sion 9.2).26 The 2-year individual weights estimated by the
National Center of Health Statistics and made available as part
of the NHANES dataset are adjusted to the entire US popula-
tion, based on 2000 Census information. To accommodate the
joining of 2001­2002 and 2003­2004 datasets, each adjusted to
the US population; the weight for each individual was divided
by 2 to provide a single estimate for the entire US population.

RESULTS
For these analyses, women between the ages of 14 and
49 with trichomoniasis data were included. A total of 998
women were excluded from the analyses due to missing data
for trichomoniasis. Women with information on trichomoniasis
were at lower risk for STI than those without based on common
risk factors; they were older (27.4 years [standard deviation
{SD}: 10.9] vs. 26.1 year [SD: 10.2], P 0.001), were less
likely to be black (13% vs. 17%, P 0.01), and more likely to
have a high school education (53% vs. 44%, P 0.01). Women
in the analytic sample had more lifetime sexual partners (mean:
8.7 [SD: 47 vs. 6.2],9 P  0.11), but this difference was not
statistically significant. They also did not differ significantly in
marital status, age at first sexual intercourse, number of sexual
partners in the last year, or in poverty status. The final sample
included data from 3648 women, which when weighted, rep-
resents the experience of 65,563,298 US women between the
ages of 14 and 49.
The prevalence of trichomoniasis was 3.2% with 85% of
cases reporting no vaginal symptoms in the past month. The
prevalence did not vary significantly with age, but did vary with
race, country of birth, marital status, education, and poverty
level (Table 1). Notably, trichomoniasis was 12 times more
prevalent among black women. Trichomoniasis was more com-
mon among women with younger ages at first intercourse and
more lifetime and last year sexual partners. The prevalence was
significantly higher among those with a history of genital
herpes or warts (7.5% vs. 2.9%, P 0.01). Similarly, tricho-
moniasis was more common, but not significantly so, among
women reporting gonorrhea or chlamydia in the past 12 months
(9.2% vs. 3.3%, P  0.09). Trichomoniasis was more common
in women who had ever been pregnant or had a low birth
weight infant, but there was no difference among women
currently pregnant (2.8% vs. 3.2%, P  0.66) compared to
nonpregnant women. Although trichomoniasis was not more
prevalent among women reporting vaginal symptoms (3.6% vs.
3.2%), such as itching, unusual discharge, or odor in the past
month, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was approximately 5
times higher among women who had douched in the past month
(10.2% vs. 2.1%; OR: 5.75, [95% CI: 3.97­8.33]) or past 6
months (8.9% vs. 1.7%; OR: 5.30, [95% CI: 3.71­7.57]). TV
was more common among women with co-occurring STIs (Fig.
1) and ranged from 4.2% among women with HSV-1 to 29.7%
among HIV-positive women.
All STIs examined (chlamydia, HSV-1, HSV-2, syphilis,
and HIV) were more common among women with positive for
trichomoniasis. The prevalence of chlamydia was 3.7% among
trichomoniasis positive women and 2.2% among negative
women (P  0.21). Chlamydia was significantly more common
among TV-positive women 25 years of age and younger than
TV-negative women (10.2% vs. 2.4%, P  0.01), but there was
no difference between those with versus without TV among

older women (0.7% vs. 0.8%, P  0.94). The crude relative
risk of chlamydia associated with TV infection was 1.79 (95%
CI: 0.76­4.22). After adjustment for race/ethnicity, age, and
number of sexual partners in the last year, this effect was
greatly attenuated and remained not significant (Table 2).
The prevalence of HSV-1 was significantly higher
among TV-positive women when compared to TV-negative
women (83.5% vs. 58.2%, P 0.01; Table 3). HSV-1 was less
common among younger women, but this disparity was evident
in women 14 to 25 as well as those 26 and older. In an
unadjusted analysis the risk of HSV-1 was 43% more common
in the presence of trichomoniasis. This effect was attenuated
somewhat after adjustment for race/ethnicity, age and recent
sexual partners, but remained statistically significant (RR 
1.20, 95% CI: 1.09­1.34).
Likewise, the prevalence of HSV-2 was higher among
women who had trichomoniasis than among women who did
not (65.1% and 23.8%, P 0.001). As with HSV-1, HSV-2 was
less common among younger women (Table 3). For HSV-2,
however, the age-specific impact of trichomoniasis appeared to
vary. HSV-2 was more than 4 times more common among
TV-positive women (47.4% vs. 10.1%) in younger women;
while in older women HSV-2 was slightly more than twice as
common (67.4% vs. 28.3%). The increased risk of HSV-2
associated with TV was 2.74 (95% CI: 2.32­3.23; Table 2), but
this was attenuated after the adjustment for race/ethnicity, age
and recent sexual partners (RR  1.51, 95% CI: 1.20­1.89).
Due to the striking racial disparities in the prevalence of
TV (discussed in detail by Sutton et al2) we were also interested
in examining these associations stratified by race/ethnicity.
Unfortunately, given the constraints of the sample size and
complex survey design, we were not powered to conduct ad-
justed analyses, but were able to examine univariate associa-
tions (data not shown). Of note, there were too few events
among non-Hispanic white and Mexican American women to
make inferences about chlamydia, gonorrhea, past syphilis, or
HIV infection. For all racial groups, women with TV had
significantly rates of HSV-2 than those without. A similar
finding was observed for HSV-1 for white and black women,
but not Mexican American women. Among Mexican American
women 82.5% women with TV were positive for HSV-1 com-
pared with 80.8% among those without TV.
Finally, the prevalences of both a positive treponemal
test (3.5% vs. 0.6%, P 0.001) and HIV (2.4% vs. 0.2%,
P 0.001) were significantly higher among women with
trichomoniasis (Table 3). Small sample size prohibited us
from examining this association among younger women, but
these findings both persisted among women 26 years and
older. In crude analyses, a positive treponemal test was 6
times (95% CI: 2.07­18.8) and HIV was 13 times (95% CI:
2.88­59.1) more common among women with trichomoni-
asis (Table 2). After adjustment, these effects were signifi-
cantly attenuated, but again, small sample size limited our
inferences from these models.
DISCUSSION
In this analysis of a representative sample of women in
the United States, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was 3.2%
with more than 80% of cases reporting no vaginal symptoms.
TV infection was associated with coinfection with HSV-1,
HSV-2, HIV, and with having syphilis in the past. The associ-
ations between trichomoniasis and HSV-1 and HSV-2 re-

mained statistically significant after adjusting for race/ethnicity,
age, and number of sexual partners in the past year.
Coinfection of HSV-2 and TV has been shown in the
past. In a prospective cohort study of female sex workers in
Kenya, the association of HSV-2 and trichomoniasis was ex-
amined and the incidence risk ratio for TV infection with
HSV-2 was 2.3.27 Interestingly, there are no other studies, to
our knowledge, that have shown an association between TV
and HSV-1. The association between trichomoniasis and
HSV-1 is modest after adjustment, however, this is likely an
underestimate of the true association because diagnosis of
HSV-1 was determined through serological testing. Serological
testing does not allow differentiation among infection sites or
transmission pathways. Given that there is little biologic plau-
sibility for the association of oral HSV-1 and vaginal tricho-
moniasis, it is possible that the association of genital HSV-1
and TV is even greater than our estimate. Testing the infec-
tion site and transmission pathway is important in getting a
true estimate of the association as multiple recent studies
have found a shifting proportion genital herpes cases attrib-
utable to HSV-1.28 ­32
Stark racial disparities in TV prevalence have been
documented in examination of this sample2 as well as other
population-based studies.3 Sample size prevented stratified
analysis, but we found that HSV-2 was more common in
TV-positive women among all racial/ethnic groups. HSV-1 was
more common among TV-positive women among white and
black women, but not Mexican American women. The rate of
HSV-1 for Mexican American was high compared to white and
black women and similar irrespective of TV status, but com-
parable to estimates generated from NHANES.31
The association between chlamydia and TV infection
also proves to be interesting. When looking at all women in our
analysis there was not a clear association between these 2
infections, however, when categorized by age, an important
risk factor for chlamydial infection, the younger and higher risk
age group (14­25) showed a statistically significant correlation
of TV infection with chlamydia. It is possible that when com-
bined with the low prevalence group of women 26 years of age
and older, the effect estimate was attenuated, not accurately
reflecting the prevalence in either age group. In a study by
Datta et al that used an earlier wave of NHANES (1999­2001)
similar dampening of chlamydia rates were seen. Their results
showed that in women aged 14 to 19 the prevalence of chla-
mydia was 4.6%, but among older aged women chlamydia
prevalence was found to 1.9% with an overall rate of 2.5%.33
A relationship between trichomoniasis and syphilis as
well as HIV was also seen. However, upon adjusting for
race/ethnicity and age the relationship was no longer signifi-
cant. This may be due to small sample size and confounding
factors that play a role in HIV and syphilis transmission and
acquisition. The correlation of TV infection and HIV has been
well-documented and therefore may still be clinically important
regardless of confounders. As additional waves of NHANES
data are released this should be studied further.
It is hypothesized that TV infection may lead to easier
acquisition of HIV or that TV and HIV coinfection may in-
crease transmission to sexual partners. Infection with TV re-
cruits a local cellular immune response, leading to an increased
number of white blood cells in the genital region and also often
causes lesions in the genital region; the presence of white blood
cells and lesions can increase acquisition, allowing for easier
entry of HIV and also having an increased number of target
cells. This may also work to increase viral shedding by making
viral exiting easier.34,35 The association could possibly be due
to immunosuppression associated with HIV that may lead to
becoming infected with TV more readily.4
One of the strengths of our study is that the data are
generalizable to the population of reproductive aged females in
the United States. Women eligible for this analysis were at
slightly lower risk for STI based on demographic characteris-
tics and lifetime number of sexual partners than the entire
sample, possibly reflecting participation bias. As most studies
of coinfection with TV are in higher risk populations, such as
women attending STI clinics, this study provides important
information on women in the general population who may be
low risk for STIs or may not seek health care. Finally, the
method used to diagnose trichomoniasis was PCR detection,
which is the most sensitive measure of TV infection.36
Our study was cross-sectional in design and therefore it
was not possible to establish temporality between trichomoni-
asis and concurrent STI. Therefore, it cannot be established
whether TV leads to increased infection with other STIs, or if
the other STIs increase TV infection. There are multiple pos-
sible mechanisms through which TV may increase the risk of
subsequent STI. TV may increase infection through genital
lesions and/or recruitment of white blood cells to the site of
infection. TV may increase vaginal pH reducing defense mech-
anisms against STIs.37 An additional, noncausal explanation
could be that STIs are concurrent due to sexual risk factors that
increase the overall risk of infection. Moreover, as a cross-
sectional study we have limited information on recent receipt of
antibiotics, which may explain the low prevalences of chla-
mydia and gonorrhea which are screened for during routine
care and easily treated. Another potential limitation could in-
clude nondifferential misclassification of STIs, particularly of
chlamydia (which has a sensitivity of 80.5 and specificity of
98.4, respectively) that may have biased the results towards the
null. Moreover, as a number of the STIs examined were not
curable, this study may be influenced by incidence-prevalence
bias, a form of selection bias. Certain demographic and repro-
ductive characteristics at the time of the survey may (e.g., age
or number of recent sexual partners) have changed since the
time of viral infection. And finally, due to the rare outcomes of
HIV and syphilis, there was inadequate power to determine
whether inferences could be made about TV coinfection.
Trichomoniasis is the most common STI. It is typically
asymptomatic and is associated with concurrent STIs among
women in the general population. The associations we have found
in this cross-sectional association were modest, but given that
nondifferential misclassification may have led to underestimation
of associations and the prevalence of genital herpes infections,
there may be significant public health impact. Given this associ-
ation it is important to rethink whether this infection should be
included in targeted STI screening in high-risk women. The im-
plications for adverse outcomes with TV suggest that more routine
testing for TV infection should be considered. Recognizing this
infection may help prevent further infection with other STIs and
may help avoid adverse reproductive outcomes.
