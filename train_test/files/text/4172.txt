Introduction
miR-145 is a short, non-coding RNA that plays an essen-
tial role in differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMC)
from stem cells and maintenance of a quiescent, contrac-
tile phenotype in mature SMC.1 miR-145 has also been
described as a putative tumour suppressor2 and a large
body of work has highlighted its dysregulation in multiple
forms of cancer including prostate, brain and lung.3­6 Its
potential role in the physiological and pathological devel-
opment of various malignancies or vascular disorders is
therefore undeniable, and a thorough understanding of its
regulation would be valuable for informing potential new
therapies in many disorders/diseases.
Expression of miR-145 is complex, being encoded in a
bicistronic unit with miR-143 on human chromosome
5q32.7 A primary transcript (pri-miR-143/145) is gener-
ated from the miR-143 host gene (miR143HG, Figure 1)
which is then cleaved by DGCR8/Drosha into the two
individual pre-miRs, pre-miR-143 and pre-miR-145.

Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence is growing globally, and the leading cause of mortality in these patients is cardiovascular
disease. Epigenetic mechanisms such as microRNAs (miRs) and DNA methylation may contribute to complications of
type 2 diabetes mellitus. We discovered an aberrant type 2 diabetes mellitus­smooth muscle cell phenotype driven by
persistent up-regulation of miR-145. This study aimed to determine whether elevated expression was due to changes
in methylation at the miR-145 promoter. Smooth muscle cells were cultured from saphenous veins of 22 non-diabetic
and 22 type 2 diabetes mellitus donors. DNA was extracted, bisulphite treated and pyrosequencing used to interrogate
methylation at 11 CpG sites within the miR-145 promoter. Inter-patient variation was high irrespective of type 2 diabetes
mellitus. Differential methylation trends were apparent between non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus­smooth
muscle cells at most sites but were not statistically significant. Methylation at CpGs -112 and -106 was consistently
lower than all other sites explored in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus­smooth muscle cells. Finally, miR-145
expression per se was not correlated with methylation levels observed at any site. The persistent up-regulation of miR-
145 observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus­smooth muscle cells is not related to methylation at the miR-145 promoter.
Crucially, miR-145 methylation is highly variable between patients, serving as a cautionary note for future studies of this
region in primary human cell types.

These are exported from the nucleus, cleaved by Dicer and
incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC) to act on their respective messenger RNA targets
(reviewed in Rangrez et al.7). A common promoter lies
upstream of the miR143HG start site to regulate expres-
sion of both miRs;8 however, individual promoters for
miR-1439 and miR-1452 have also been described.
Targeting of messenger RNAs by miRs is a form of epi-
genetic regulation, whereby gene expression is modulated
independently of changes to the DNA sequence. Another
form of this regulation, DNAmethylation, is also important
in directing messenger RNAexpression. Due to its involve-
ment in cancer, a number of studies have examined meth-
ylation immediately upstream of miR-145.3­6 This region
contains 11 potential methylation sites (Figure 1(b)), yet
while methylation across this region was generally
increased in malignant pleural mesothelioma tissue3 and
prostate cancer sections,6 in glioma the scenario was more
complex with increased methylation in cell lines5 but not in
intact tissue samples.4 It is therefore crucial to carefully
consider source material (i.e. tissues, cell types) when
investigating any potential differences in methylation and
exploring its relevance to disease pathology.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an escalating global
burden and an area of intensive research; recent studies
have highlighted the importance of differential methyla-
tion in this multi-faceted disease.10­12 The leading cause of
mortality in T2DM is coronary heart disease13 and patients
frequently require surgical intervention through coronary
artery bypass grafting using the patient's own saphenous
vein (SV). However, outcomes in T2DM patients are infe-
rior to those without a diagnosis of diabetes.14 Moreover,
achieving tight glycaemic control does not ameliorate car-
diovascular complications, at least in the medium term.15,16
The relative resistance of macrovascular complications to
glucose normalisation is suggestive of metabolic memory
­ a concept believed to possess a strong epigenetic compo-
nent inducing long-lasting and potentially irreversible
changes in cell function.17
In support of this theory, we demonstrated potentially
detrimental phenotypic changes in a number of cardiovas-
cular cell types derived from multiple patients with
T2DM.18­22 Specifically, we discovered an aberrant SMC
phenotype from the SV of T2DM patients which was char-
acterised by increased spread cell area, cytoskeletal disar-
ray and reduced proliferation, and driven by elevated
expression levels of miR-145.19 The ability of SMC to
dynamically switch and modulate their phenotype is
required for adaptive vessel remodelling and is critical fol-
lowing bypass grafting. This persistently aberrant venous
phenotype conceivably contributes to the poor surgical
outcomes in this patient group, although it is not necessar-
ily representative of global changes within all SMC in the
diabetic patient. Importantly, maintenance of the pheno-
type throughout serial passaging19,20 supports the idea of
epigenetic regulation at the level of differential miR-145
expression, which itself may be modulated via DNA meth-
ylation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to interrogate
potential methylation sites immediately upstream of the
miR-145 coding region and to determine whether there
were any differences between SMC cultured from patients
with or without T2DM.
Methods
Reagents
All tissue culture reagents were from ThermoFisher (Life
Technologies), Paisley, UK, except foetal calf serum (FCS)
which was from LabTech International, Uckfield, UK.
DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
pyrosequencing reagents were from Qiagen, Crawley, UK.
RNA extraction kit was from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel
Hempstead, UK, and miR reverse transcription and Taqman
assays were from ThermoFisher (Life Technologies).
Cell culture
SMCs were isolated and cultured from SV fragments col-
lected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting at the Leeds General Infirmary as previously
described,23 with local ethical committee approval (LREC
CA01/040) and informed written patient consent. This
study conformed to the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki. All cells irrespective of diabetic
status were maintained under identical conditions in
medium comprising Dulbecco's modified eagle medium
(DMEM) with 10% FCS, 100µg/mL penicillin-streptomy-
cin, 2mM l-glutamine and 25
mM glucose, at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2
in air. All experiments
were performed on cells between passages 3 and 5, across
which miR-145 expression is stable.19
DNA isolation and bisulphite conversion
DNA was extracted from confluent cells using a QIAamp
DNA Micro Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.
Two micrograms of DNA was subsequently converted
using EpiTect Plus Bisulfite Kit according to manufactur-
er's instructions to convert any unmethylated cytosine
residues to uracil residues.
Pyrosequencing
Pyrosequencing assays were designed using PyroMark®
Assay Design SW 2.0 for the region flanking the miR-145 and
miR143HG transcription start sites. These included an ampli-
fication primer set where one primer was biotinylated, and a
sequencing primer.Amplicon length was restricted to <200bp
to ensure optimal pyrosequencing. Bisulphite-converted DNA
124 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 14(2)
was amplified using Pyromark® PCR Kit on a thermal cycler
as follows: 15
min at 95°C, 45 cycles of 30
s at 94°C, 30
s at
56°C and 30
s at 72°C, then 10
min final extension stage at
72°C (primer sequences are listed in Table 1). A small aliquot
was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel to ensure a single,
intense band was observed. The remaining product was subse-
quently used for pyrosequencing, in triplicate, on the
Pyromark® Q24 according to manufacturer's instructions. The
methylation status of each CpG site was determined using
PyroMark® Q24 Software. Standard curves were generated
using known proportions of unmethylated and fully methyl-
ated control DNA.
RNA extraction and miR-145 expression
RNA was extracted from 7
×105 cells using the Aurum
Total RNA Mini Kit as previously described.24 Expression
of miR-145 was determined using Taqman MicroRNA
Reverse Transcription Kit and Taqman assays specific to
human miR-145-5p and snoU6 (housekeeper) in triplicate
according to manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean
±
standard error of mean
(SEM), with n representing experiments performed on dif-
ferent donors' cells in each group. Patient age was tested
for normality in GraphPad Prism v6.05 using the Shapiro­
Wilk normality test followed by t-test. The proportion of
patients of each sex was tested by binomial test. As
methylation sites were not acting independently of each
other, we used a multivariate model to examine differences
at separate sites using the formula

Diabetes, age and sex were classified as independent
variables, and all methylation sites (189 etc.) as dependent
variables. Correlation was assessed using R squared.
Significance was considered at p<
0.05. Power calcula-
tions were performed using GraphPad StatMate 2.0.
Results
Patient demographics
Non-diabetic (ND) patients had a mean age of 59.0±2.5
(range, 40­82) years and were 91% male. T2DM patients
had a mean age of 63.5
±
2.5 (range, 35­85) years and
were 87% male. The age of patients in both groups was
normally distributed and not significantly different from
each other (p
=
0.21). The proportion of male:female
patients was analysed using the binomial test as the num-
ber of females in each group was too small to be analysed
using chi-square test; again, there was no significant dif-
ference in the proportion of males:females (p=0.47). Of
the patients receiving treatment for T2DM, 4.3% were diet
controlled, 78.3% were receiving oral therapies and 17.4%
were additionally supplemented with insulin.

Methylation assay design
A series of pyrosequencing methylation assays were
designed to encompass the miR-145 and miR143HG pro-
moters (Figure 1). The region of interest covering 11
potential CpG methylation sites in the miR-145 promoter
was analysed with two primer sets to ensure that pyrose-
quencing assays were of an optimal length. Using a range
of methylated DNA standards (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%
methylated), we characterised the sensitivity of the assays
to detect methylation at each position before constructing
a standard curve for each CpG site, from which methyla-
tion data for individual patients was interpolated. In gen-
eral, the assays were sensitive to the degree of methylation
as exemplified in Figure 2(a) for CpG -32; however, sen-
sitivity at the CpG cluster -112 to -106 was consistently
poorer than that at other sites (Figure 2(b)).
Methylation levels at the miR-145 promoter in
SMC isolated from ND and T2DM patients
Methylation levels were determined for each site from 22
ND and 22 T2DM-SMC (Figure 3(a)). Overall, there was
a tendency to reduced methylation in T2DM-SMC for
CpGs distal to the start site (CpG -189 to -106); T2DM-
SMC where 2.3%­11.5% lower than ND-SMC. However,
at more proximal positions, this pattern was lost and there
were no consistent trends in methylation at CpGs -32 to
+13 (Figure 3(a)). Inter-patient variation was high at all
sites regardless of diabetes; however, the degree of varia-
bility was less at CpGs closer to the transcription start site.
Given this variation, and despite analysis of a total of 44
patient samples, the study was not sufficiently powered
(Table 2) to detect a change in methylation of 5% (the
mean difference observed across the 11 separate CpG
sites). Analysis of the mean methylation across all 11 sites
revealed no significant differences in miR-145 methyla-
tion in T2DM-SMC (Figure 3(b)).
Methylation at CpGs -112 and -106 routinely appeared
lower than at other sites. To ensure these data were robust,
we analysed these two positions using three different
assays (Figure 1(b) and Table 1) and reliably detected con-
sistently lower levels of methylation at these particular
sites (Figure 3(c)).
Correlation of miR-145 expression with
methylation
Methylation of this region of the miR-145 gene has previ-
ously been reported to correlate with its expression.6 Given
our previous report of elevated miR-145 expression in
T2DM-SMC,19 we determined the expression of miR-145
in RNAsamples that were prepared in equivalent cells from
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the miR-145 locus. (a) Both premiR143 and premiR145 (grey boxes) are transcribed from
a large primary transcript (miR143HG; white box) from chromosome 5q32, in between the genes encoding interleukin 17 beta and

the same patient cohort. Methylation at any individual site
(e.g. CpG -189; the site with the lowest p-value of 0.113),
and methylation across all sites, did not correlate with miR-
145 expression in human SV-SMC (Figure 4(a) and (b)).

Pyrosequencing of the miR143HG promoter
region
As methylation at the miR143HG promoter region could
conceivably modulate expression of both miR-143 and
miR-145, we proceeded to interrogate six CpG sites
(Figure 1, Table 1). However, pyrograms were consistently
of a poor quality due to large homopolymeric regions and
did not yield reliably quantifiable results (data not shown).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of
DNA methylation in primary human SV-SMC in two
defined patient cohorts. A key strength was that analysis
was performed in cells from multiple patients. Few studies
have examined methylation specifically in the SV, and
those that have predominantly analysed DNA from whole
tissue wherein global changes in methylation in distinct
cell types were potentially masked.25­27 Using pure popu-
lations of human primary cells is therefore a key strength
of this study. Other studies have used SMC derived from a
single commercial source.28 However, this could lead to
misinterpretation of any observed differences because, as
we have clearly demonstrated here, a single sample is
without doubt not representative of a diverse patient popu-
lation. Our study using isolated SV-SMC from a total of 44
patients provides a broad view of inter-patient variation in
methylation that is related to venous SMC specifically.
While the patient donors used in this study were age
and sex-matched, we did not have access to full patient
demographics [e.g. body mass index (BMI), HbA1c and
statins] some of which could conceivably impact our data
analysis if they were found to differ between the two
groups. However, in our previous, larger study we had
access to clinical data on HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) and creatinine for the patient donors
and also the proportion who were receiving statin therapy,
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
-blockers, anticoagulant drugs and diuretics. We found
that T2DM patients had significantly higher fasting glu-
cose and HbA1c, but all other parameters were identical
between ND and T2DM patients including cardiovascular
therapies.19 Therefore, it is likely that the only known dif-
ference between the two patient groups analysed here was
a clinical diagnosis of diabetes.
We focussed our attention on the region immediately
upstream of miR-145 as this is the only area that has previ-
ously been interrogated. We observed trends towards
reduced methylation at CpGs -189 to -106. A long-held
consensus indicates that promoter methylation and gene
expression are inversely related;29 the observed subtle
reduction in methylation would support this hypothesis,
given higher expression levels of miR-145 we reported in
T2DM-SMC.19 Previous studies demonstrated both hyper-
methylation and reduced expression in both mesothelioma
and prostate cancer.3,6 miR-145 modulates cellular prolif-
eration2,7 and our observations together with the aforemen-
tioned cancer studies support a role for increased miR-145
methylation (and lower expression) in hyper-proliferative
disorders such as cancer and reduced methylation (and
higher expression) in T2DM-SMC in which we unambigu-
ously demonstrated reduced proliferation.18­20
Methylation at CpGs -112 and -106 was consistently
lower than at all other sites; this was validated by three sepa-
rate assays. Reduced methylation at these specific CpGs has
only once previously been demonstrated in prostate cancer
patients.6 Therein, a reduction in methylation at CpGs -112
and -106 was observed in some, but not all, patient samples
as we found in this study, suggesting that reduced methyla-
tion at these sites might be specific to SMC or non-malignant
cells. This highlights the cell-specific nature of DNA meth-
ylation30 and emphasises the importance of examining meth-
ylation in primary, patho/physiologically relevant cell types.
The key finding of this study was the marked variability
in miR-145 methylation, irrespective of T2DM.

-189 and (b) mean methylation across the entire region (n=22 of each population).
128 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 14(2)
Methylation across the entire region was not statistically
different between ND and T2DM-SMC. Retrospectively,
using these data we performed power calculations (Table
2) which indicated that a population >200 would be
required to achieve statistical power. Because we have pre-
viously demonstrated robust, consistent up-regulation of
miR-145 expression with sample sizes of 10 per patient
population,19 the fact that we would require up to 200 for
methylation studies adds weight to our argument that dif-
ferential methylation of the miR-145 promoter is not the
causative factor for its elevation in T2DM-SMC.
Since methylation at CpG -189 was most divergent
between ND and T2DM cells, we investigated whether this
correlated with miR-145 expression. However, methylation
at this site alone or across the entire region did not correlate
with expression, agreeing with a previous study in glioma.4
In contrast, Suh et al.6 demonstrated a correlation between
methylation and expression in 47 cancer cell lines includ-
ing breast, colorectal, pancreatic, prostate and kidney; stud-
ies that by their nature, minimise inherent variability that is
attributable to that in primary cells and tissues.
We previously demonstrated a consistent up-regulation
of miR-143 in parallel with miR-145 in T2DM-SMC.19 It is
plausible that expression and regulation of the host gene
miR143HG is more critical for the enrichment of both miR-
143 and miR-145, although methylation within the
miR143HG promoter has not yet been studied.We attempted
a series of pyrosequencing methylation assays upstream of
miR143HG; however, the capacity to interrogate this region
was overwhelmed by technical issues due to large homopol-
ymeric regions. As a result, pyrosequencing methylation
analysis was inconsistent and unreliable. Nevertheless, the
ability to develop a robust assay to interrogate the host gene
promoter would possibly be valuable.
Conclusion
In conclusion, pyrosequencing is a robust and accurate
technique to quantify DNA methylation at multiple sites in
human SV-SMC. A key finding was the very high degree of
variation in methylation between cells from different indi-
viduals irrespective of diabetes status, underscoring the
importance of adequate sample sizes to provide sufficient
power when working with material from unrelated indi-
viduals and delivering a cautionary note for future studies.
In cancer, matched malignant and normal tissue from the
same patient almost certainly provides improved statistical
power of analysis, and this approach can also be used for
atherosclerosis or other localised pathologies;31,32 however,
it is neither practical nor possible when examining com-
plex, systemic diseases such as T2DM. The high variability
that we have shown in methylation makes it incredibly
unlikely that changes in methylation are responsible for the
persistent and, more importantly, consistent up-regulation
of miR-145 expression in T2DM-SMC; however, we can-
not discount that methylation of miR143HG may contrib-
ute to these differences. Importantly, epigenetic signatures
are not limited to DNAmethylation ­ it is likely that a com-
plex interplay between methylation, chromatin and histone
modifications and transcription factors are involved in reg-
ulating miR-145 expression. While a detailed examination
of the miR143HG region may prove informative, studies
that adopt a `whole population' approach may not provide
the answers being sought. T2DM is a complex heterogene-
ous pathology that is the culmination of multiple genetic
and environmental risk factors. In the future, the advent of
personalised medicine whereby a patient is treated on the
basis of their unique epigenetic signature may provide the
revolution in treatment of T2DM and its complications.
Given the increasing epidemic of T2DM and its attendant
morbidity, such novel targets for therapy are urgently
required.
