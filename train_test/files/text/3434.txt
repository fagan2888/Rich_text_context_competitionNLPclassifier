Introduction
Both experimental and anecdotal evidence support a strong
association between driving experience and spatial ability.
Some 40 years ago, Appleyard (1970), a psychologist who
advised on the development and planning of an expanding
city in Venezuela, asked hundreds of the city's inhabitants to
draw sketch maps of their local areas and the city as a whole,
finding that those who drove motor vehicles drew better
sketch maps of the city layout than people who generally
traveled via other means, for example, in buses or taxis.
Appleyard (1970) concluded that variations in travel mode
"profoundly" influence people's representations of their
environment (see also Hart & Berzok, 1982). Subsequent
studies, with young adults, have found supporting evidence
as drivers were better able to draw maps of areas adjacent to
their own neighborhoods than peers who do not drive
(Andrews, 1973; Brown & Broadway, 1981). That active
spatial displacement is beneficial for cognitive "mapping"
(O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978) is supported by other evidence.
For example, Hart (1981) found that children who walked to
school were more accurate at estimating the distance between
home and school than children who were transported by car,
whereas Joshi, MacLean, and Carter (1999) found that walk-
ing children included more landmarks in their drawings of
their neighborhoods than car-driven peers.
Compared with walking and other forms of transporta-
tion, car-driving experience per se has a special status. Beck
and Wood (1976) argued that in addition to having greater
mobility and traveling at "geographic scale," drivers must

Active Versus Passive Acquisition of
Spatial Knowledge While Controlling
a Vehicle in a Virtual Urban Space in
Drivers and Non-Drivers
George Sandamas1 and Nigel Foreman2
Abstract
Historically, real-world studies have indicated a spatial learning advantage for people who actively explore the environment
they inhabit as opposed to those whose experience is more passive. A common contrast is made between the spatial learning
of car drivers and passengers. However, compared with walking and other forms of transportation, car-driving experience per
se has a special status. An experiment was conducted to explore the dual hypotheses that active explorers learn more about
the layout of a virtual environment (VE) than passive observers and that real-world car drivers will learn more regardless of
their experimental active/passive status. Participants explored a virtual model of a small town in active/passive, pairs. Active
exploration was self-directed and goal driven, and all learning tasks were explicit. Consistent with many earlier studies in VEs,
there was no benefit from activity (controlling exploration/movement), arguably because input control competes with spatial
information acquisition. When participants were divided according to whether they were licensed drivers or not, the results
showed that drivers were significantly more accurate than non-drivers at indicating the positions of target locations on a map,
in both the active and passive conditions. An interaction showed that in the active condition, drivers had significantly better
route scores than non-drivers, and better than drivers in the passive condition. Driving may therefore be beneficial for spatial
abilities over and above the general benefits of "activity" and when spatial skills are examined in VEs, driver experience is an
important criterion that should be taken into account.

attend more vigilantly to features of the environment such as
street names, road signs, and potential landmarks, as well as
distance and directional information. Moreover, compared
with a pedestrian or a cyclist, the motorist controlling a vehi-
cle is exposed to landmarks and spatial cues in rapid succes-
sion, avoiding decay in short term or spatial working memory
stores, potentially enhancing the development and coherence
of spatial representations. This may explain why spatial
mapping skills improve with driving experience (Maguire,
Woollett, & Spiers, 2006). In professional London taxi driv-
ers, the size of the posterior hippocampus--a structure in the
temporal lobe traditionally implicated in cognitive spatial
mapping (Morris & Parslow, 2004)--is enlarged, arguably
reflecting repeated usage in navigating the complex array of
streets in the U.K. capital (Maguire etal., 2006). Woollett
and Maguire (2010) found that taxi drivers were better at
learning the layout of a novel environment than matched
controls, drawing more accurate sketch maps of a novel
urban environment and better at "executing routes" through
that environment.
Gaunet, Vidal, Kemeny, and Berthoz (2001) have argued
that drivers' spatial learning may benefit directly from their
being in control of their actions and displacements while
experiencing visual­motor interaction and making autono-
mous decisions concerning displacements in space. This is
consistent with a prominent model of spatial learning put for-
ward by Siegel and White (1975), which proposed that route
learning is an early stage of spatial learning, involving a
sequence of decisions, taking place via the paired associa-
tions of actions with landmarks ("stimulus-response pair-
ing") and facilitated by activity. From a recent extensive
theoretical review of the literature, Chrastil and Warren
(2012) concluded that motor vehicle control and associated
proprioceptive and vestibular feedback support the develop-
ment of route and survey map-type spatial knowledge of vir-
tual environments (VEs), but that cognitive control--having
to actively navigate and make decisions--is not contributory.
Similarly, Stulpnagel and Steffens (2012, Experiment 2)
found that tandem drivers were better at a landmark recogni-
tion task than back seat passengers regardless of active/pas-
sive navigation status. They concluded that vehicle control is
important for landmark recognition, although cognitive navi-
gation promotes better route and survey knowledge.
There are reasons for doubting whether vehicle control is
always beneficial in the way that Gaunet etal. (2001) suggest.
Baddeley (1982) describes a conflict that he discovered
between keeping his vehicle in lane while attempting to imag-
ine the layout of an American football pitch. This is important
anecdotal evidence because it implies that, if the memory and
processing of wider allocentric spatial information is compro-
mised by the operation of vehicle controls, these are likely to
share common processing and compete for cognitive capacity
(see also Pick, 2010). Indeed, a driver's actions in controlling
a vehicle can, in an experimental context (cf. Sandamas &
Foreman, 2014), arguably be considered a secondary task,
competing with any other currently active spatial thinking or
imagery and reducing the cognitive capacity available for the
processing of environmental information linked to the encod-
ing of space. Of course, this is most likely to create difficulty
for novice drivers (including non-drivers tested in a driving
simulator), whose cognitive capacity is occupied largely by
the mechanics of driving. Paradoxically, therefore, while
driving may be seen as enhancing spatial processing of the
environment--correlating with long-term driving experi-
ence--vehicle control may compete with and reduce spatial
processing in the short term, especially in inexperienced or
novice drivers.
The present study employed the flexibility and reproduc-
ibility of a VE. Despite obvious differences between virtual
and real environments, there exists considerable similarity
between spatial knowledge acquired from each (see Peruch
& Gaunet, 1998, for a review). Furthermore, Gaunet etal.
(2001) suggest that active exploration of a VE with an input
device shares important features with real-world active
exploration such as the tight linkage between visual self-
motion and motor activity, and therefore driving simulators
offer the opportunity to study relatively lifelike active navi-
gation in a controlled environment (Aginsky, Harris, Rensink,
& Beusmans, 1997). In past studies, equivalence of experi-
ence has not been matched between active and passive
groups, as active and passive perceptual experience has usu-
ally been confounded with the motoric activity involved in
vehicle control. These factors can be separated using a VE.
However, previous research using VEs to investigate
active/passive differences in spatial learning has been equivo-
cal. The spatial learning advantage for active explorers,
expected from previous real-world studies, although reported
in some VE-based studies measuring landmark object recogni-
tion (Hahm etal., 2007) and route finding (Chrastil & Warren,
2013; Farrell etal., 2003; Peruch, Vercher, & Gauthier, 1995;
Wallet, Sauzeon, Rodrigues, Larrue, & N'Kaoua, 2010), has
not appeared consistently as many studies report no reliable
active advantage (see Gaunet et
al., 2001; Wilson, 1999;
Wilson, Foreman, Gillett, & Stanton, 1997; Wilson & Peruch,
2002). For reviews of this issue, see Stulpnagel and Steffens
(2012) and Sandamas and Foreman (2007). Indeed, in some
cases, a passive advantage has been reported. For instance,
Sandamas and Foreman (2007) initially found that passive
participants were better at a map placement task after experi-
ence of a VE than their active counterparts, subsequently find-
ing (Sandamas, Foreman, & Coulson, 2009) that the active
advantage could be restored if participants were given prior
training with the input device used to explore the VE. Chrastil
and Warren (2012) proposed that one reason for the unreliabil-
ity of activity benefit in desktop VEs is that they are impover-
ished in terms of the proprioceptive and vestibular information
that standard input devices provide for active explorers. In a
follow-up study however, they reported that vestibular infor-
mation was not an important component for spatial learning in
a VE but that podokinetic and visual information are (Chrastil
Sandamas and Foreman 3
& Warren, 2013). Wilson etal. (1997) and others have also
proposed that the standard input devices commonly used to
navigate VEs may compete directly for cognitive capacity if
they are unfamiliar to the user and that this too could be a
major factor in the unreliable findings reported for the benefits
of the active exploration of virtual space.
The current study used measures of pointing accuracy,
route learning, and survey mapping to assess the general
benefits of activity (virtual vehicle control) for participants'
learning of the spatial layout of a novel virtual town, while
also considering what impact driver status itself might have.
Note that in past studies, driver status has not usually been
considered in relation to participant selection or used as a
factor in statistical analysis. Participants in the present active
condition navigated around a complex VE designed to look
like a small town center, using a steering wheel and pedal
input device (so having both motoric control and cognitive
control), whereas participants in the passive condition
viewed exactly the same displacements as the active partici-
pants (but had no motoric or cognitive control).
For the purposes of the present study, in light of the above
conflicting evidence, and as previous studies showing pas-
sive advantage were conducted with input devices such as
mouse, keyboard, or joystick rather than driving simulator
equipment, we adopted a naïve hypothesis (based on real-
world studies) that active participants who "drove" a virtual
vehicle would learn more about the spatial layout of the VE
than passives, and perform better on both survey mapping
and route knowledge tasks (cf. Chrastil & Warren, 2012;
Hahm etal., 2007; Stulpnagel & Steffens, 2012). Second, to
address the impact of driver status (cf. Gaunet etal., 2001),
active and passive data were collected from a group of real-
world drivers and another having had no experience of car
driving. Better performance was expected from drivers than
non-drivers on all measures, irrespective of the experimental
condition in which they were tested.
Method
Participants
Table 1 shows how participants were split across the two cat-
egories of driver status. Participants who were car drivers all
confirmed that they drove regularly and preferred car driving
to any other form of transport. A t test, t(32) = 1.10, p = .283,
confirmed that drivers were not older than non-drivers.
Setting
The experiment took place in a large room (approximately
7 m2) designated as the VR laboratory. The windows were
blacked out to enhance the virtual image, with the lights
switched off, to increase the sense of immersion by reducing
the conspicuousness of objects in the room while partici-
pants explored the VE.
Apparatus
The VE was constructed using Superscape 3-D virtual reality
software run on an IBM compatible desktop PC with an Intel
Pentium 3 processor. The output image was fed directly to an
Electrohome Projection Systems ECP 3500plus standard
RGB projector. The 1 × 2 m image was projected onto a 2 ×
4 m screen (a white painted wall) 4.5 m from the projector,
the lower edge being 1 m above the floor level. The image
was thereby projected over the head of participants who sat
at a desk, 3.5 m from the screen. Participants in the driver
condition sat with the input device in front of them. The
input device, chosen to give participants the feel of driving
around the VE, was a thrust-master steering wheel and pedal
arrangement providing directional, acceleration, and brak-
ing control. The steering wheel was fixed to the desk with
the pedal unit sitting on the floor underneath it. This was
removed when the participants in the passenger condition
viewed the VE.
The layout of the VE was designed to resemble, broadly
speaking, a typical small U.K. town center consisting of six
blocks of buildings and trees bounded by roadways; four
cross roads, a T-junction, and a centrally located roundabout
with 5 exits (see Figure 1). The virtual buildings were of sev-
eral types, including multi-storey office blocks, brick-
rendered residential type houses, shops, including a super-
market and newsagent (see Figure 2), a bank, and a church.
In addition to a roundabout, other street features included
railings, a pelican crossing, a post-box, a phone-box, two
statues, and a clock monument. Many of the objects within
the VE, such as the trees, street furniture, and generic build-
ings, were downloaded directly from the Superscape "ware-
house," although buildings dressed in the liveries of Barclays
Bank, Tesco, WH Smith, and KFC were created for the cur-
rent study. In essence, the VE was designed to contain many
of the elements and the complexities one would expect to
find in a small town center.

Procedure
Participants experienced the VE in either the active (driver) or
passive (passenger) condition. Participants in the active condi-
tion were instructed that they would have 10 min to explore
the VE and that within that time they must find four readily
identifiable locations labeled variously as Home, College,
Babysitter, and School, while also trying to "get to know" the
layout of the VE, so that the learning task was explicit. The
exploration of each active participant was videotaped and
shown to the following participant who would therefore be in
the passenger (passive) condition. Participants in the passive
condition were told that they were viewing a 10-min tape of
somebody "driving around" a VE and that they were to look
out for four readily identifiable locations (the same locations
that participants in the active condition were told to look for)
while also trying to "get to know" the layout of the VE. At 5,
7, and 9 min, the experimenter asked all participants how
many of the target locations they had found and informed
them of the time they had left.Any participants who could not
find all four locations within the 10 min allowed for the task
could not proceed to the next stage of the experiment. This
happened in only one instance.
Before being introduced to the experimental environment,
all active participants were given instruction on how to use
the input device and given the opportunity to "drive" around
a practice virtual road circuit until they reported that they felt
comfortable. Participants adjusted to the sensitivity of the
controls in terms of turn and acceleration within the first
minute and completed this task with ease. Importantly,
Sandamas etal. (2009) found that prior experience of an
input device to navigate a practice VE could restore the
advantage on a map placement task for active explorers over
passive observers, while without input device training pas-
sive participants were better (Sandamas & Foreman, 2007).
They interpreted this as indicating that untrained use of the
input device excessively loads working memory and acts as
a concurrent task interfering with the main task of learning
the layout of the test environment. This interpretation was
given further support by the findings of Sandamas and
Foreman (2014).
Outcome Measures
After experiencing the VE, measurement of participants'
spatial knowledge acquisition was designed to evaluate both
survey and route knowledge as per Siegel and White's (1975)
model of spatial learning.
Survey mapping, street-level view
Pointing error (PE) scores.Participants were required to
point to unseen locations from a central point within the VE
by aiming a cross hair in the center of the screen at the tar-
get. This was achieved by rotating the viewpoint. The loca-
tions were those four that participants were required to look
for during the exploration phase, plus one other that was
highly visible (a red statue). PE scores were calculated from
the cumulative difference between the true direction of the
targets and participants' indicated directions, measured in
degrees. The scores were summed and divided by 5 to give
mean scores for PE (see Table 2; see also Foreman, Stanton,
Wilson, & Duffy, 2003; Sandamas & Foreman, 2007; Stulp-
nagel & Steffens, 2012).
Survey mapping, bird's eye view
Map placement error scores.Each participant was given
an A4 sheet of paper with the road layout of the VE printed
on it and asked to indicate as accurately as possible, by
marking the paper with the corresponding numbers, the posi-
tions of the four locations they were asked to find during
the exploration phase of the study. Placement error scores
were then calculated by measuring distance in millimeters
between the positions indicated by the participants and the
true location positions. These distances were summed for the
four locations and divided by 4 to give mean scores for map

environment.

placement error (MPE; see Table 2; see also Sandamas &
Foreman, 2007; Sandamas, Foreman & Coulson, 2009).
Route knowledge
Route scores. Participants were required to travel via the
shortest route between four pairs of locations within the VE;
the locations used were those participants were required
to look for during the exploration phase. The start point of
each route was adjacent to one of the locations. Participants
were "transported" directly to the start point and instructed
to "drive" via the shortest route to the target location. Partici-
pants had to make four such journeys (college to home; home
to the red statue; red statue to the baby sitter; baby sitter to
the school). Participants'displacements during this task were
recorded and subsequently scored using the following crite-
ria: 0 points for failing to reach the target location within the
permitted time; 1 point for indirectly (doubling back, retrac-
ing steps, etc.) finding the target location; 2 points for find-
ing the target location directly (no doubling back or retracing
steps) but not via the shortest route; and 3 points for find-
ing the target location directly via the shortest route. Par-
ticipants' points were totaled to give overall "route scores"
(max: 12 points).
Results
The independent variables used in the following analyses
were "condition" (active/passive) and "driver status"
(whether or not participants were real-world car drivers).
The dependent variables were PE scores (in degrees), MPE
scores (in millimeters), and route scores.
Descriptive Statistics
Table 2 shows PE scores (in degrees), MPE scores (in milli-
meters), and route scores for condition by driver status.
Inspection of the means indicates a trend in favor of drivers
on all measures under all conditions except for route scores
under the passive condition.
Inferential Statistics
The scores in Table 1 were subjected to a 2 (condition [active/
passive]) × 2 (driver status [Driver/Non-Driver]) independent
groups factorial ANOVA.
A significant main effect for driver status was indicated
for MPE scores, F(1, 30) = 4.933, p = .034, p
2
= .141
(inspection of the means indicates that participants who were
car drivers [driver] were more accurate at indicating the posi-
tions of target locations on a map, in both the active and pas-
sive conditions, than participants who had indicated that they
were non-drivers [see Figure 3]), but not for PE scores,
F(1, 30) = .433, p = .515, p
2 = .014, or route scores, F(1, 30)
= .877, p = .356, p
2 = .028. There were no significant main
effects for condition on MPE scores, F(1, 30) = .772,
p = .387, p
2 = .025; PE scores, F(1, 30) = .162, p = .690,
p
2
= .005; or route scores, F(1, 30) = .877, p = .356, p
2 = .028.
From Figure 3, we can see, from the lower MPE scores,
that drivers are more accurate at placing landmarks on a map
of the VE regardless of the condition (active/passive) than
non-drivers.
Asignificant interaction for driver status by condition was
indicated for route scores, F(1, 30) = 8.981, p = .005,

(alphas for the four t tests being adjusted to account for fam-
ily-wise error using the Holm Test protocol) showed that
drivers in the active condition had significantly higher route
scores than drivers in the passive condition, t(18) = 3.22,
p = .005 (d = 1.52, r = .60) and non-drivers in the active con-
dition, t(15) = 2.67, p = .017 (d = 1.38, r = .57). There were
no significant differences between non-drivers in the active
and passive conditions, t(12) = 1.26, p = .23 (d = 0.73,
r = .34) or between drivers and non-drivers in the passive
condition, t(15) = 1.52, p = .15 (d = 0.78, r = .36).
From Figure 4, we can see that real-world drivers in the
active condition achieved higher, but not significantly so,
route scores than all other participants.
Correlation analysis revealed a significant negative rela-
tionship between route scores and MPE scores, r(32) = -.42,
p = .01, indicating that participants who were better at navi-
gating routes between landmarks in the VE, obtaining higher
route scores, were also more accurate at placing the land-
marks on a map of the VE, obtaining lower MPE scores.
However, performance on PE scores did not correlate with
either route or map MPE.
Discussion
The first experimental hypothesis, that active vehicle drivers
would learn more about the spatial layout of the VE than pas-
sive observers, was not supported. Passive participants per-
formed at the same level as their active counterparts when
pointing to currently non-visible locations within the VE,
identifying the positions of locations on an outline map of
the VE and driving routes within the VE. The current find-
ings, therefore, demonstrate that, for adults at least, activity
in a VE does not necessarily confer an advantage for spatial
learning of that environment, supporting the findings of
many previous virtual world studies (e.g., Arthur, 1996;
Gaunet etal., 2001; Sandamas, 2007; Sandamas & Foreman,
2007; Wilson, 1999; Wilson etal., 1997; Wilson & Peruch,
2002). Clearly, whether an active advantage does appear, as
in studies such as those of Farrell etal. (2003), Hahm etal.
(2007), and Wallet etal. (2010), may depend upon factors
including the nature of the input device and the degree of
training with which participants are provided prior to begin-
ning the virtual exploration. Further specific study of these
factors is needed. Moreover, age effects might be anticipated
as studies such as those of Siegel, Herman,Allen, and Kirasic
(1979), Feldman and Acredolo (1979), and Herman (1980)
and the virtual experiments of Sandamas and Foreman
(2007) have all indicated that as humans progress from child-
hood to adulthood they become less reliant on self-guided
locomotion through space to form good spatial representa-
tions. Sandamas etal. (2009), however, did find that 7- to
8-year-olds were able to demonstrate the benefits of activity
within a VE after initial training with the input device.
The current findings are inconsistent with the conclusions
of many real-world environmental studies including those of
Appleyard (1970), Hart (1981), Hart and Berzok (1982) who
have argued activity to be beneficial for spatial learning in
adults, based on the performance of real-world drivers com-
pared with passengers. However, it should be noted that
these former studies were not controlled experiments per se,
but rather ecological/urban studies (Appleyard, 1970; Ladd,
1970) or theoretical review papers (Hart & Berzok, 1982;
Siegel & White, 1975). Although Appleyard (1970) found
car drivers to be better able to draw coherent city maps than
bus passengers--and this has been often cited in subsequent
papers as demonstrating the benefits of activity--it is unclear
whether this reflects the benefits of activity per se (i.e., the
physical act of driving and/or the mental act of making direc-
tional choices) or whether it arises because they get to expe-
rience more of the city that they are free to explore at
"geographic" scale. In the current study, this confound was
addressed as both active participants (who drove around the
VE using the input device) and passive participants (who did
not have any control over exploration) experienced the envi-
ronment to the same extent; yet in this case, no differences in
spatial learning emerged. Another advantage for drivers in
the real world is that the act of driving itself forces them to
attend more closely to where they are going and anticipate
the routes they need to take (Chrastil & Warren, 2012). This
means that environmental features such as street names, road
signs, potential landmarks, distance, and directional infor-
mation carry more importance for the car driver than for the
casual passenger (see Beck & Wood, 1976). However, were
passengers to attend to the environment during journeys to
the same extent that is mandatory for drivers, their spatial
learning could be equivalent to, or even greater than, that of
drivers as they are not distracted by performing the concur-
rent task of physically driving. In the current study, both
active and passive participants were given the same instruc-
tion to "get to know" the environment to attenuate any differ-
ences in attention between the groups, and no differences in
spatial learning were found.

It might be suggested that the findings of previous real-
world research, such as those of Appleyard (1970) and others
(see above), may not reflect the benefits of activity per se but
rather demonstrate benefits related to driving and consequent
superior processing of spatial information. The current find-
ings go some way to supporting this notion in that we did
find a clear advantage on the map placement and route mea-
sures of spatial learning for participants who were car drivers
in the real world. For instance, car drivers were significantly
better than non-car drivers at indicating the positions of tar-
get locations on a map, regardless of the active or passive
condition in which they participated. Previously, Beck and
Wood (1976) suggested that experience with conventional
maps predicts the ability to use maps as a vehicle for the
expression for geographic knowledge, and Appleyard (1970)
found that drivers drew maps that were more complete and
coherent than those of passengers. Sandamas and Foreman
(2007) found that greater experience in a VE led to better
survey maps of the VE irrespective of the active or passive
status of participants, although real-world driver status was
not considered and this could have been a factor. Therefore,
the current finding may be taken to demonstrate that car driv-
ers have a greater understanding of, and ability to use, maps
or they have developed other skills through driving which
they are able to transfer to the understanding of new environ-
ments under a range of conditions including that of experi-
encing them passively.
It was also found that real-world car drivers in the experi-
mental active condition were better at navigating routes
within the VE than non-drivers in the active condition and
car drivers in the passive condition. As the input device used
in this study was a steering wheel, for directional control,
paired with a set of pedals to control acceleration and brak-
ing, the situation closely replicated the experience of driving
a vehicle with which drivers were all familiar. Real-world
car drivers in the active condition may have benefited more,
in terms of spatial learning, because they were able to explore
the VE by driving round it, consistent with their experience
in real life. Added to this, it could also be argued that real-
world drivers using an input device that replicates driving are
probably better able to adapt to--and less likely to suffer any
cognitive disadvantage such as reduced working memory
capacity from--this imposition than are non-drivers, as for
child participants (Sandamas & Foreman, 2007; Sandamas
etal., 2009). Furthermore, Foreman, Sandamas, and Newson
(2004) did not find any advantage on a distance estimation
task for participants who used a step device to "walk" around
a VE over participants who experienced the VE actively,
with a joystick or passively; virtual distance underestimation
was consistent across groups.
The current study has also revealed a significant negative
correlation between route scores and MPE scores indicating the
interdependent relationship between survey and route knowl-
edge and that these two aspects of spatial learning appear to
develop fairly quickly and in parallel as proposed by
Montello (1998) rather than in a strictly hierarchical way
over an extended period of time, as proposed by Siegel and
White (1975). Sandamas and Foreman (2004) also found that
memory for landmarks and map drawing ability were posi-
tively correlated after brief experience of a VE. Interestingly,
PE scores did not correlate with either of the other two mea-
sures of spatial learning in the current study or differentiate
active/passive or driver/non-driver groups. The implication
may be that the participants found the task too difficult and
were unable to orient themselves within the VE, despite
being able to navigate around it and place landmarks on a
map of it. In addition, this finding may further illustrate the
sensitivity of spatial learning to procedural, task, and mea-
surement differences as pointed out by Wilson (1999),
Chrastil and Warren (2012), and others, and therefore needs
further investigation.
Obviously, the current findings raise many questions
and research opportunities regarding the status of activity
for spatial learning in adults, the role driving has to play in
the development of specific spatial skills related to road-
dominated environments and maps, and how best to use
VEs in the future for transport and training, also the assess-
ment of age-related driving competences (Pick, 2010;
Ponds, Brouwer, & van Wolffelaar, 1988). The data also
emphasize that driver experience is an important criterion
that should be taken into account when sampling partici-
pants for participation in spatial experiments. Furthermore,
driving and navigating should be regarded as representing
competing "dual tasks," especially for novice drivers;
driver status is therefore a factor that should be incorpo-
rated in future into statistical analyses of any spatial learn-
ing data.
