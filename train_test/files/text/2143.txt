Longitudinal associations between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and overall cancer mortality were evaluated within the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988­2006; n =15,535). Mortality status was ascertained
using the National Death Index. Self-reported LTPA was divided into inactive, regular low-to-moderate and vigorous activity. A
frequency-weighted metabolic equivalents (METS/week) variable was also computed. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated for overall cancer mortality in the whole sample, by body mass index categories and insulin resistance
(IR) status. Nonsignificant protective associations were observed for regular low-to-moderate and vigorous activity, and for the
highest quartile of METS/week (HRs range: 0.66­0.95). Individuals without IR engaging in regular vigorous activity had a 48%
decreased risk of cancer mortality (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28­0.98) in multivariate analyses. Conversely, nonsignificant positive
associations were observed in people with IR. In conclusion, regular vigorous activity may reduce risk of cancer mortality among
persons with normal insulin-glucose metabolism in this national sample.
1. Introduction
Cancer is a major public health concern in the United
States with approximately 25% of total deaths attributed
to cancer [1]. The projected number of cancer deaths in
2010 alone was 1500 deaths per day, corresponding to a
total of over 560,000 deaths. Therefore, investigations into
modifiable risk factors that may reduce the rates of cancer
mortality continue to be of significant importance. Physical
activity has been hypothesized to protect against cancer
through obesity reduction, improved insulin sensitivity and
sex hormone profiles, and lowered inflammation [2]. The
World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Can-
cer Research Expert Panel Report concluded that physical
activity likely reduces the risk of some cancers and suggested
an active lifestyle for protection against cancer progression
and mortality [3]. However, concrete recommendations for
physical activity to prevent cancer mortality are lacking, in
part, due to inconsistencies in the existing evidence, and due
to varying methodology and differing definitions of physical
activity used [4]. Furthermore, at this time associations with
physical activity are better established for cancer incidence as
compared to mortality [4, 5].
A greater understanding of the protective effects of phys-
ical activity may enhance existing cancer control strategies
and potentially reduce cancer mortality. The present study
strengthens the evidence in the current literature by exam-
ining longitudinal associations between leisure-time physical
activity (LTPA) in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III: 1988­1994) linked to
mortality data through 2006. Excess adiposity and aberra-
tions in the insulin-glucose axis are hypothesized to promote
2 Journal of Obesity
carcinogenesis [6, 7] and may offset the protective potential
of physical activity. It is noteworthy that research in the
area of cancer mortality has typically focused on a single
risk factor. Less attention has been devoted to the combined
effects of body weight, insulin resistance (IR), physical activ-
ity, and cancer mortality [8­11], and the interrelationships of
these risk factors warrant investigation. Therefore the current
study is designed to expand the physical activity-cancer
hypothesis by assessing whether body mass index (BMI)
and IR modify the relationships of physical activity and
cancer mortality. Existing data available from this national
sample on body weight, laboratory values, self-reported phy-
sical activity data, and cancer mortality (N = 863) prov-
ides a unique opportunity to conduct these analyses. The
results of this study provide data to guide clinical trials that
may ultimately contribute to individualized physical activity
recommendations for cancer control.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Population. The NHANES III (1988­1994) pop-
ulation, a national sample of civilian noninstitutionalized
individuals, was selected through a complex, multistage
probability design [12]. Persons who were 17+ or older were
eligible for the mortality follow-up from the date of partic-
ipation (1988­1994) through December 31, 2006. This rep-
resents the last NHANES III mortality update. The current
analyses included adults 20­89 years. Per the Adult Treat-
ment Panel (ATP) definition, individuals were considered to
be adults if they were at least 20 years old [13]. NHANES par-
ticipants 89+ years were assigned an arbitrary age of 90 years
for confidentiality purposes and were excluded from the ana-
lyses. Pregnant women were excluded because their baseline
physical activity and BMI may not be an accurate reflection
of their usual activity or body weight. Additionally, persons
with missing values for the pertinent variables were also
excluded, resulting in a final sample of 15,535 individuals.
2.2. Data Collection. The NHANES III survey consisted
of a structured household interview and a standardized
physical examination in a mobile examination center at
entry into the study. Participants self-reported their age,
race/ethnicity, level of education, leisure-time physical activ-
ity, dietary intakes, alcohol use, current prescription medica-
tion, and presence of doctor-diagnosed cancer in a personal
interview. Race/ethnicity were categorized into (1) non-
Hispanic whites, (2) non-Hispanic Blacks, (3) Mexican-
Americans and (4) "other." Trained personnel measured
height, weight and waist circumference during the in-person
examination [12]. The measured height and weight were
used to compute BMI. Smoking status was assessed during
the in-person interview, in which participants reported
the use of cigarettes, pipes, and cigars. A fasting blood
sample was obtained during the physical examination that
was used to measure fasting plasma glucose concentrations.
Details of the NHANES III protocols have been previously
published [14]. Figure 1 describes the data collection strategy
in NHANES III.

2.3. Exposure: Leisure-Time Physical Activity. A question-
naire consisting leisure-time physical activity questions
including type of activity and frequency of the activity in
the past month was queried in the Household Adult Ques
tionnaire administered once at baseline. There was no
additional follow-up information on physical activity and
other variables after time of entry into the study until the end
of mortality follow-up (Figure 1). At baseline, participants
were asked for example, if "In the past month, did you run
or jog?" and "In the past month, how often did you jog or
run?" Similarly, questions were asked on walking, bicycling,
swimming, aerobics and/or aerobic dancing, other dancing,
calisthenics, yard work, lifting weights, and engagement in
up to four other activities that were not mentioned in the
survey. Frequency of engagement in activities over the past
30 days was reported. These responses were standardized to
weekly frequency by using the conversion factors of 4.3
weeks/month and 30.4 days/month per NHANES III [15].
A validated intensity rating in metabolic equivalents (MET)
was provided by NHANES III for each activity as defined
in the Compendium of Physical Activities [16]. For exam-
ple, jogging/running was assigned an intensity rating of
"8 METS." For this study, LTPA was classified as "low inten-
sity," "moderate" and "vigorous" using the standard cut-offs
established by Pate et al. [17]. Activities requiring <3 METS
were classified as "low-intensity," activities requiring 3­
6 METS were classified as "moderate" and >6 METS were
classified as "vigorous" [17]. Participants who did not re-
port engagement in any of the activities, were classified as
"inactive." Because individuals engaging in "low intensity"
activities represented <0.05% (n = 7) of the population, they
were combined into the "moderate" activity group.
Next, participants were categorized as performing "reg-
ular low-to-moderate" exercises if they reported performing
the activity at least 5 times per week and "regular vigorous" if
they reported performing vigorous activities at least 3 times
per week. These categories were mutually exclusive (so that
if an individual performed vigorous and low-to-moderate
activities, he/she was included in the vigorous activity group
and not in both groups). Additionally, a frequency-weighted
Journal of Obesity 3
LTPA variable was calculated by multiplying the frequency
of each activity by its corresponding intensity value and
summed. This variable was divided into quartiles in the
regression models. The NHANES III survey did not collect
information for duration of each bout of exercise, which
limits more precise estimation of physical activity. The phy-
sical activity definitions used in this study are consistent with
previously published studies using the NHANES III popula-
tion [18­21].
2.4. Cancer Mortality Ascertainment. Mortality information
was obtained from the updated NHANES III Linked Mortal-
ity Files that provide mortality follow-up data from the date
of participation in the survey (1988­1994) through Decem-
ber 31, 2006 (Figure 1). Mortality was ascertained based
upon either death certificates or from a probabilistic match
between NHANES III and the National Center for Health
Statistics, National Death Index (NDI) records. Cancer
mortality was identified using the International Classification
of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10; NCHS 2006; ICD-10
codes C00­C97). Persons were considered alive at the end
of the follow-up period if they were not matched to a death
record. Details of the mortality files are described elsewhere
[22].
2.5. Statistical Methods. Descriptive statistics were generated
to assess demographic, lifestyle and dietary attributes related
with cancer mortality, and to identify potential confounders.
Next, unadjusted univariate hazard ratio (HR) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CI) of overall cancer mortality and
level of LTPA were computed using Cox proportional hazard
models, using age as the time scale. Persons who died from
causes other than cancer were censored at the age of death
and persons who were considered alive were censored at the
end of the study follow-up period.
We tested demographic, lifestyle, physiological, and die-
tary factors as potential confounders of the associations of
LTPA and cancer mortality, by entering these additional vari-
ables singly into the Cox proportional hazards models. If the
addition of the variable singly in the model changed the HR
for cancer mortality by 10% or more, the variable was added
to the final regression model. Potential variables tested were
age (continuous and years), race or ethnicity (categorical:
white, black, Mexican, and other), cardiovascular disease
(categorical: yes/no), BMI (categorical: normal weight,
overweight and obese), smoking (categorical: never, current,
past), alcohol consumption (continuous: number of drinks/
day), education (categorical: <12 and 12 years), aspirin
use (yes/no) total dietary proteins (continuous: grams/day),
total dietary fats (continuous: grams/day) total dietary car-
bohydrates (continuous: grams/day), and total calories
(continuous: kilocalories/day). We tested for potential effect
modification (considered significant for the purpose of these
analyses at alpha value of 0.10 or less) by race, age, gender,
BMI, and IR status for the relationships of physical activity
and cancer mortality. A significance level of 0.05 was used
for all the other tests. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by
reanalyzing the associations after excluding persons with a
baseline report of doctor-diagnosed cancer (n = 588). For
exploratory purposes, we repeated analyses in adults 40+
years at baseline (n = 9348). The statistical analyses were
performed using SAS v.9.1 and SUDAAN v.10.0.1 Sample
weights provided by NHANES III were applied to all the
analyses.
3. Results
3.1. Participant Characteristics. Baseline characteristics of
NHANES III sample are expressed as either weighted freq-
uencies for categorical variables or weighted means with
their corresponding standard errors (SEs), and minimum
and maximum values for continuous variables (Table 1). The
population consisted of 76.8% non-Hispanic Whites, 10.4%
non-Hispanic blacks, 5.2% Mexican-Americans, and 7.8%
"other" ethnicities. The mean population age was 45 years.
Approximately 85% of the participants reported engaging in
any physical activity, with half (53.3%) of the population
being moderately and 16.9% being vigorously active on
a regular basis. About 15% of the sample was "inactive."
Furthermore, 33% of the participants reported being more
active, 21% reported being less active, and 44% estimated
about the same level of activity as compared to their peers
of the same sex and similar age. Over half the population
was obese or overweight (BMI > 25), with a mean waist
circumference of 92 cm. Twenty-two percent of the popu-
lation had the insulin resistance syndrome, defined per the
ATP III criteria as having at least three of the following five
criteria: abdominal obesity (waist circumference >102 cm
in men or >88 cm in women), insulin resistance (blood
glucose >110 mg/dL), low high density lipoprotein (HDL)
(<40 in men or <50 in women), high serum triglycerides
concentration (>150 mg/dL), and hypertension (systolic
blood pressure >130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
>85 mm Hg.) and 10.67% were insulin resistant (defined as
blood glucose levels >110 mg/dL) [13]. In this dataset 5.5%
(n = 863) of the population had died from cancer at the
end of the follow-up period till 2006. Approximately 15%
of the patients who had died of cancer had reported doctor-
diagnosed cancer during their in-person baseline interview.
3.2. Associations between Leisure-Time Physical Activity and
Overall Cancer Mortality. Overall, nonsignificant inverse
associations were observed for overall cancer mortality
among persons engaging in any activity, regular low-to-
mod- erate or regular vigorous activity in the whole pop-
ulation (Table 2). Individuals who engaged in any activity
were 8% and 5% less likely to die of cancer as compared
to individuals who were "inactive," after adjusting for age
(HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.71­1.19) and additional variables (HR:
0.95; 95% CI: 0.72­1.26), respectively. Associations were
in a similar direction for regular low-to-moderate activity
(HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.69­1.21), regular vigorous activity (HR:
0.66; 95% CI: 0.39­1.13), and for the highest versus lowest
quartile of frequency-weighted METS per week (HR: 0.89;
95% CI: 0.68­1.16) after adjusting for age, race, sex, and
smoking status, albeit not statistically significant. Additional
adjustment for BMI did not change the associations.

Analyses were repeated after excluding self-reported his-
tory of cancer at baseline (n = 588) to assess whether the
observed nonsignificant associations persisted. The HRs
among individuals with no history of cancer at baseline ran-
ged from 0.82 to 1.09 for all levels of regular LTPA; however,
the HRs were not statistically significant after adjusting for
age and additional covariates in the whole population and
the conclusions remained unchanged (Table 2). Restricting
analyses to adults 40+ years at baseline yielded similar results
(data not shown).

Previous research has reported that BMI and IR are
associated with cancer mortality [6, 23, 24]. Significant effect
modification (a priori considered significant if P < 0.1) by
IR in the relationships of physical activity and overall cancer
mortality were noted (P = 0.07). Therefore, the analyses
were stratified by IR status (yes/no) as shown in Table 3.
Among individuals who were not insulin resistant, signifi-
cant 54% (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24­0.87) and 49% (HR: 0.51;
95% CI: 0.27­0.97) decreased risk were observed between
engagement in regular vigorous activity and overall cancer
mortality, after adjusting for age and additional variables,
respectively. Among individuals who were insulin resistant,
an 82% increased risk of cancer mortality was observed (HR:
1.82; 95% CI: 0.71­4.65), albeit this finding was not statis-
tically significant and therefore cannot be considered defini-
tive. These associations persisted when the relationships were
reevaluated in a sample after excluding persons with a cancer
diagnosis at baseline, in sensitivity analyses (data not shown).
Although there was no significant effect modification by
BMI (P = 0.355), for exploratory purposes only, the ana-
lyses were stratified by BMI < 25 (normal weight) and
>25 (obese or overweight). Among persons with a lower

BMI, the observed inverse associations were more protective
for any activity and overall cancer mortality, albeit non-sig-
nificant after adjusting for age (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.55­1.22)
and additional variables (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.61­1.35) as
compared to individuals with a BMI > 25 ((age-adjusted
HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.73­1.42) and (adjusted for additional
variables HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.73­1.46)). The HR were
similarly <1 but remained non-significant among persons
with a normal BMI engaging in regular low-to-moderate or
regular vigorous LTPA. The direction of the associations
persisted when reevaluated after excluding persons with no
cancer diagnosis at baseline (data not shown).
Next, the frequency-weighted METS/week variable was
divided into quartiles in the Cox proportional regression
Journal of Obesity 7
models. Quartile 1 was the referent group and represented
participants with the lowest level of METs expended, and
quartile 4 represented the individuals with the highest level
of METs expended. Although not significant, the HRs for
quartiles 2, 3, and 4 were <1 as compared to quartile 1.
These associations persisted among persons without insulin
resistance and among participants with a BMI<25. The non-
significant decreased risk for cancer mortality persisted after
excluding persons with a cancer diagnosis at baseline (data
not shown). Furthermore, HRs were similar when analyses
were repeated among individuals who were 40 years or older
at baseline.
4. Discussion
The current study was undertaken to elucidate the relation-
ships between LTPA and cancer mortality in a nationally rep-
resentative dataset and its linkage to mortality status (1988­
2006). The comprehensive data available in the NHANES III
sample on obesity, insulin resistance, and physical activity
history provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the com-
bined impact of these factors on longitudinally ascertained
cancer mortality, an approach that has typically not been
used in the previous studies.
Although the results of the current study are not statisti-
cally significant in the whole population, they are suggestive
of protection against overall cancer mortality, specifically for
vigorous activity (HR < 1). This study is similar to previous
studies that have evaluated physical activity in relation to
overall cancer mortality of site-specific cancer mortality. For
example, a recent prospective cohort study among elder
Japanese adults noted that high levels of physical activity (5
or more days per week) were associated with a 23% decreased
risk of overall cancer mortality (P for trend = 0.02) [25].
Previous studies have shown that physical activity protects
against mortality from some common cancers including
lung [3], prostate [10, 26], breast [27­29], and colon cancer
[11]. We observed a slight attenuation of the non-significant
associations in the sensitivity analyses after excluding persons
with self-reported cancer at baseline. This could perhaps
be due to lifestyle changes among the cancer cases after
diagnosis, or due to reverse causality. However, unavailability
of follow-up measures of physical activity in the NHANES
III survey limits the complete understanding of this phe-
nomenon. Furthermore, the current study suggests that the
protection afforded by LTPA may be realized in the absence
of aberrations in the insulin-glucose axis. We note that the
protective associations of LTPA and cancer mortality were
more pronounced among non-insulin-resistant individuals
who engaged in vigorous LTPA.
Several biological mechanisms may explain the potential
protective role of physical activity against cancer mortality.
With respect to this study, IR-related mechanisms seem
particularly relevant. Insulin, an anabolic hormone, is
hypothesized to promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis,
and support cancer progression [30­32]. Regular LTPA has
been associated with improved insulin sensitivity [33­36].
Studies have demonstrated that the benefits of physical
activity are apparent even in the absence of changes in body
weight [2, 35]. IR is associated with increased levels of sex
hormones and increased levels of inflammation [35], that
may affect cancer risk [35, 37]. LTPA may also improve
hormonal profiles [38, 39], reduce systemic inflammation
[2], and ultimately delay cancer mortality.
Despite the potential biological mechanisms of physical
activity in cancer biology, associations were not significant
for all levels of LTPA in the whole population in this study.
Some inherent limitations of the NHANES III survey design
and assessment methods for physical activity could have
contributed to measurement error and the quantitatively
weak findings. It has been hypothesized that the time course
of risk factors along the continuum of the cancer process
is important [40] and previous studies suggest that physical
activity after the diagnosis of cancer influences cancer mor-
tality [29, 41]. LTPA information was collected once dur-
ing the in-person interview at baseline. Changes in LTPA
patterns over time and engagement in LTPA after cancer
diagnosis during the follow-up period were not captured,
potentially biasing the results towards the null. Next, physical
activity was self-reported and was therefore vulnerable to
recall bias due to under- or overreporting their level of LTPA
[42]. Further, the NHANES III dataset was not well powered
to investigate site-specific cancer mortality. Lastly, the results
of this study might be an underestimation of the associations,
because the exposure data were collected in 1988­1994 and
the prevalence of IR as well as the proportion of physically
inactive persons have increased in the past two decades [43­
45], emphasizing the importance of physical activity in the
current context.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study uniquely utilizes a large, nationally
representative sample of US adults and assesses the interre-
lationship between LTPA, obesity, and IR, two hypothesized
risk factors of cancer mortality in the previous literature. The
results suggest that the protective effects offered by physical
activity against cancer mortality may be realized through
the maintenance of normal metabolic function and may
thereby serve a potential cancer control tool. If confirmed
in additional epidemiologic studies, these findings may have
important public health implications in the context of the
high rates of insulin resistance and cancer mortality and
a large proportion of persons with sedentary lifestyles in
the USA. Further research is also required to determine the
critical periods of exposure to physical activity during the
life course with exposure measures before and after cancer
diagnosis in relation to cancer outcomes in prospective
studies.
