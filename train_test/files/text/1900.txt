Data from the 1999­2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative, cross-
sectional survey of US health and nutrition, were analyzed to assess prevalence of dietary supplement use
overall and in relation to lifestyle and demographic characteristics. Fifty-two percent of adults reported taking a
dietary supplement in the past month; 35% took a multivitamin/multimineral. Vitamin C, vitamin E, B-complex
vitamins, calcium, and calcium-containing antacids were taken by more than 5% of adults. In bivariate analyses,
female gender, older age, more education, non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, any physical activity, normal/
underweight, more frequent wine or distilled spirit consumption, former smoking, and excellent/very good self-
reported health were associated with greater use of any supplement and of multivitamin/multiminerals; in
multivariable comparisons, the latter three characteristics were not associated with supplement use. Most
supplements were taken daily and for at least 2 years. Forty-seven percent of adult supplement users took just
one supplement; 55% of women and 63% of adults aged 60 years took more than one. These findings suggest
that, to minimize possible spurious associations, epidemiologic studies of diet, demography, or lifestyle and
health take dietary supplement use into account because of 1) supplements' large contribution to nutrient intake
and 2) differential use of supplements by demographic and lifestyle characteristics.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of
1994 (1) assured consumer access to a wide range of dietary
supplements. Dietary supplements of all varieties are now
marketed in the United States, including single-ingredient
products and various combinations of vitamins, minerals,
botanicals, and other constituents. Media attention to supple-
ments, including advertisements, informational articles, and
studies reporting associations with health conditions, is
considerable. Marketing data show a dramatic increase in
supplement sales since 1997, which totaled approximately
$18.8 billion in 2003 (2).
Consequently, current detailed data on the prevalence of
supplement use and characteristics of users are needed to
inform the design, analysis, and interpretation of epidemio-
logic studies of diet or lifestyle and health. A high preva-
lence of vitamin and mineral supplement use would call for
assessment of supplement use in any study that requires
nutrient intake data, since supplements often contain 100
percent or more of the daily value of one or more nutrients.
Differences in demographic and behavioral characteristics
between supplement users and nonusers would demonstrate
the importance of including supplement assessment in both
the planning and analysis of any epidemiologic study of diet
or lifestyle characteristics and health, to minimize findings
derived from confounding with supplement intake rather
than from the characteristic itself. Caveats regarding the
generalizability of findings from groups with nonrepresenta-
tive lifestyles or demographics would also be indicated. At
present, the only published, nationally representative data on
dietary supplement use collected since the Dietary Supple-

ment Health and Education Act was passed in 1994 are those
from the Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals
1994­1996, which show higher use by women versus men and
the highest use by women aged 50­59 years but do not present
data by other demographic or lifestyle characteristics (3).
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a nationally representative survey that
comprises medical examinations and tests as well as detailed
questions about participants' health, lifestyle, and diet,
including dietary supplement use. This paper presents
NHANES 1999­2000 data on the prevalence and details of
use of any dietary supplement, and of specific vitamin and
mineral supplements for the US population aged 20 years or
older, and on associations of use with select demographic
and lifestyle characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NHANES survey
NHANES is designed to monitor the health and nutritional
status of the US population (4). A nationally representative
sample of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population is
selected using a complex, stratified, multistage probability
cluster sampling design. Selected population subgroups of
particular interest are oversampled to obtain sufficient
numbers to reliably estimate health and nutrition parameters.
In 1999­2000, oversampled groups included people with
low incomes, African Americans, Mexican Americans,
adolescents, people 60 years of age or older, and pregnant
women. The survey consists of a home interview averaging
about 1 hour and an examination in the NHANES mobile
examination unit lasting up to several hours.
Topics in the 1999­2000 NHANES interview included
self-reported race/ethnicity, education, health insurance,
smoking, current and past medical conditions, weight and
weight history, diet behavior, alcohol intake, physical
activity and fitness, and overall health (5). Many questions
refer to the past month. The 1999­2000 examination
included numerous blood biochemistries, body composition,
audiometry, oral health, vision, cardiovascular fitness, and a
physician's examination (5). Additional details about the
methods and measures, including the exact wording of ques-
tions, are available on the Internet (4­8). The NHANES
1999­2000 sample included 4,880 adults 20 years of age or
older. Response rates for the interview were 82 percent in
1999­2000.
Covariates
All covariates used in these analyses were self-reported
data obtained from the home interview. Body mass index
was calculated from self-reported height and weight (kilo-
grams/meters squared). Measured height and weight were
available; however, analytic results were nearly identical to
those from self-report, so the latter were used to maintain
consistency with other variables and the larger sample size.
Classifications of body mass index were <25.0 (normal or
underweight), 25.0­29.9 (overweight), and 30.0 (obese)
(9). Pregnant women were asked to report their prepreg-
nancy weight. Physical activity referred to self-report of
vigorous activity causing heavy sweating or a large increase
in breathing or heart rate and of moderate activity causing
light sweating or a slight-to-moderate increase in breathing
or heart rate for at least 10 minutes in the past month. Any
report of vigorous activity was classified as vigorous, a
report of moderate but no vigorous activity was classified as
moderate, and a report of neither was classified as no phys-
ical activity.
Dietary supplement data collection
Dietary supplement intake was assessed by asking partici-
pants whether they had taken any vitamins, minerals, or
other dietary supplements, including prescription supple-
ments, in the last month. They were shown a card with exam-
ples of many types of supplements (Appendix table 1).
Interviewers asked to see participants' supplement
containers, and they recorded the name and manufacturer of
each supplement from the label. If the container was not seen
(22 percent of the time), the interviewer asked for the exact
name of the product or, if not known, the supplement type,
for example, multivitamin, vitamin C. Participants were
asked how long they had been taking this product, how
often, and how much they took. Information on as many as
20 supplements could be recorded. Antacids were recorded
separately unless the participant reported using them as a
calcium supplement. Methods are described in more detail
elsewhere (4­8).
Data preparation
Trained NHANES nutritionists matched reported supple-
ments and antacids to known products (7). The supplements
and calcium-containing antacids were then categorized by
NHANES nutritionists (Appendix table 2).
Dietary supplement use prevalence was estimated using
sampling weights for each person to account for differential
probabilities of selection and nonresponse. Sample weights
were poststratified to US Census Bureau estimates of the
population to yield representative estimates (10, 11).
Because only interview data were used in these analyses,
interview weights were used.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS for
Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina). Standard errors for preva-
lence were calculated by using the delete 1 jackknife method
(10, 12), partitioning the sample into 52 sampling units and
forming 52 replicates deleting one unit at a time. Differences
between prevalence rates were assessed with two-sided t
tests. Because of the numerous comparisons possible, only
differences of p < 0.005 are noted. Prevalence estimates and
comparisons of the number, frequency, and duration of
supplements taken were based on the sample of all 4,862
adults aged 20 years or older for whom dietary supplement
data were available.

Am J Epidemiol 2004;160:339­349
Multivariable logistic regression was undertaken to assess
associations of supplement use with demographic and life-
style characteristics of interest while simultaneously
accounting for the other characteristics. Each demographic/
lifestyle characteristic included in the logistic regression
model was associated with the prevalence of at least two
supplement types in pairwise comparisons. Trend was
assessed by assigning integer scores to variables with at least
three hierarchical categories and then treating them as
continuous, assuming a linear relation. Geometric means of
the number of supplements taken were used to account for
the skewed distribution. Logistic regression was based on
the smaller sample of the 4,453 participants with complete
data for all variables that were included in the regression
model.
RESULTS
Prevalence of supplement use
Fifty-two percent of adults in our study (47 percent of
men, 57 percent of women) had taken a dietary supplement
in the previous month (table 1). Most commonly reported
were multivitamin/multiminerals (35 percent), usually a
standard or senior formula, and vitamins E and C (12­13
percent). Ten percent reported taking calcium supple-
ments, which increased to nearly 25 percent when
calcium-containing antacids not recorded as dietary
supplements were included. Use of B-complex vitamins
was reported by 5 percent. Other vitamin or mineral
supplements for which prevalence rates were greater than
1 percent are presented in table 1. Those for which the
rates were 1 percent or less, not presented in any table,
included potassium, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, beta-
carotene, molybdenum, magnesium, multiminerals,
vitamin B6
, and vitamin K.
Bivariate analysis
Comparisons of use of specific supplement types by demo-
graphic/lifestyle characteristics (tables 1 and 2) revealed a
number of consistent patterns. Use of any supplement and the
most commonly taken supplements was usually higher for
women than for men, for participants aged 60 years or older
versus 20­39 years, for non-Hispanic Whites versus non-
Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans, for participants
with more than a high school education versus less, for those
reporting moderate versus no physical activity, and for former
versus current smokers (p < 0.005 for all comparisons except
B-complex vitamins). Use of any supplement and of multivi-

Multivariable analysis
Table 3 presents adjusted odds ratios with 95 percent confi-
dence intervals for demographic/lifestyle variables associated
with the most common supplement types, any supplement,
and combined calcium/antacids. Older age and higher educa-
tion remained positively associated with dietary supplement
use for all supplement types. Greater physical activity was
positively associated with all types except vitamin C. Particu-
larly high were positive associations of older age with vitamin
E (odds ratio (OR) = 9.1, 95 percent confidence interval (CI):
6.5, 12.9) and calcium (OR = 6.2, 95 percent CI: 3.9, 9.7) use,
higher education with B-complex vitamin use (OR = 5.1, 95
percent CI: 2.9, 9.2), and female gender with calcium use
(OR = 5.5, 95 percent CI: 3.8, 7.9). In general, Mexican Amer-
icans and non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely than non-
Hispanic Whites to take supplements. Particularly low was
non-Hispanic Blacks' use of calcium and combined calcium/
antacids (OR = 0.3, 95 percent CI: 0.2, 0.4 for both) and vita-
mins C (OR = 0.4, 95 percent CI: 0.3, 0.6) and E (OR = 0.4, 95
percent CI: 0.3, 0.7). There was no association of B-complex
vitamin supplements with race/ethnicity. More frequent wine
intake was positively associated with use of any supplement
and multivitamin/multiminerals, vitamin C, and vitamin E but
not of calcium, combined calcium/antacids, or B-complex
vitamins. Increasing body mass index was associated with less
use of any supplement and multivitamin/multimineral supple-
ments and with greater combined calcium/antacid use, but not
with other supplement types. Compared with never smokers,
current smokers were less likely to take vitamin E or calcium.
In multivariable analyses, poor self-reported health was asso-
ciated only with greater B-complex vitamin use.
Details of supplement use
Forty-seven percent of supplement users took only one
supplement (table 4); only 5 percent took more than six (data
not shown). More men than women took just one supplement (p
< 0.01), but the mean number taken was similar (p = 0.06). Use
of only one supplement decreased with age (p < 0.001), mean
number increased with age (p < 0.01), and older people took
more supplements than younger ones did (p < 0.001). Only two
participants reported taking the maximum of 20 supplements.
At least 89 percent of the four most common supplement
types were taken 30 times a month or more; B-complex vita-
mins and combined calcium/antacids use was less frequent
(table 5). Over half of the users of each type except multivi-
tamin/multiminerals had taken them for 2 years or more;
over a fifth of vitamin C, vitamin E, and calcium/antacid
users had taken them for at least 10 years.
DISCUSSION
Prevalence of dietary supplement use
These NHANES 1999­2000 data are the most recent
nationally representative data available on comprehensive
dietary supplement use. They indicate that over half of US
adults aged 20 years or older took at least one dietary supple-
ment some time during the preceding month. The most
commonly used supplements were multivitamin/multimin-
erals (35 percent), vitamin C, vitamin E, and calcium.
Supplements of other nutrients of interest in relation to
health, such as selenium, folic acid, beta-carotene, zinc, and
chromium, were reported infrequently in 1999­2000.
Comparison of NHANES 1999­2000 findings with those
from previous NHANES surveys, which used similar meth-
odology, suggests that supplement use has increased. Results
from the Third NHANES survey (1988­1994) ranged from
30 to 42 percent for men and 42 to 55 percent for women
(13). Prevalence rates for adults were 35 percent in the
Second NHANES survey and 23 percent in the First
NHANES survey (14, 15). Other supplement surveys have
used different methodologies and time frames. Prevalence of
adult supplement use reported in the National Health Inter-
view Survey was 46.2 percent (1992) and 51.1 (1987)
percent for the past year (16) and 36 percent for the past 2
weeks (1986) (17). The 1994­1996 Continuing Survey of
Food Intake by Individuals reported 42 percent of men and
56 percent of women taking any vitamin or mineral supple-
ment; no time referent was used (3). Analyses of previous
supplement surveys have found demographic/lifestyle char-
acteristic associations similar to NHANES: higher usage
rates among women, Whites, older people, the more highly
educated, and former smokers (3, 13­18).
Strengths and weaknesses of the NHANES data
collection procedure
Strengths of the NHANES supplement data collection are
its nationally representative sample and the in-person inter-
view and transcription of the supplement name and manufac-
turer from the supplement container, which is then matched
to a supplement label. Other studies (19, 20) have used a
procedure similar to the NHANES method as their reference
method to assess validity of self-reported dietary supplement
use by questionnaire or via a telephone interview. Addition-
ally, NHANES supplement data are categorized by nutrition-
ists based on standardized classification rules regarding the
product name and ingredients. Such a labor-intensive proce-
dure is important for accurate data collection and categoriza-
tion. Other collection procedures cannot be assumed to
achieve this quality of data. To our knowledge, validity of
self-report of supplements by type, a commonly used
method (3, 16­18), has not been assessed. As supplements
become more complex, containing a variety of ingredients,
self-categorization may become more problematic,
increasing the need for validation studies of such methods.
Some limitations of the NHANES data are the short
referent time frame of the past month, which is used to
increase accuracy of self-report and for comparability with
other NHANES data that use this time frame. However,
results are difficult to compare with studies that assess
annual supplement use, especially for supplements used for
a short term as medications. Additionally, because the data
are cross-sectional, analyses of supplement use with the
many health conditions measured in NHANES cannot
344 Radimer et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2004;160:339­349
presume any causality, only a concurrent or subsequent asso-
ciation. While recording of the supplement name from the
label is a strength compared with many other studies, it is
still subject to some error. Capture of the label image would
improve data collection. Additionally, analytic verification
of the supplement's actual ingredient content would be
required to accurately depict nutrient content.
Implications of findings for nutrient intake
The high prevalence of daily multivitamin/multimineral
supplement use seen in the NHANES 1999­2000 data
suggests adequate intake of a large number of important vita-
mins and minerals by a sizable proportion of US adults.
However, some supplements list nutrients at levels at or
above the Upper Intake Levels (UL) set by the National
Academy of Sciences (21). Most multivitamin/multimineral
labels listed nutrients below the UL; however, some listed
amounts at or above the UL for niacin, magnesium, zinc,
iron, folate, vitamin B6
, vitamin C, and vitamin A. On some
B-complex vitamin labels, niacin and B6
exceeded the UL.
Some single- or double-nutrient supplements, such as
vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6
, iron, zinc, and calcium
plus magnesium, listed amounts at or near the UL. Addition-
ally, a person taking several magnesium-containing antacids
could be at risk of exceeding the UL for magnesium. While

such excesses may be rare, the high prevalence of use, the
availability of supplements with a high nutrient content, and
the risk of multiple supplement use make this an area of
concern.
Implications of findings for study design
A noteworthy finding of this study is that a larger part of
the population ingests nondietary calcium as antacids than as
calcium supplements, which highlights the importance of
assessing calcium-containing antacid use in studies of
calcium intake and health. Importantly, intake of calcium
antacids is sometimes greater in population groups with
lower calcium supplement use. For example, when antacids
were included, obese people, current smokers, beer drinkers,
and more frequent distilled spirit consumers were as likely as
other population groups to take supplemental calcium.
NHANES 1999­2000 data show that the most common
amount of calcium was 500 mg (range, 106­600) in a
calcium supplement and 200 mg (range, 112­500) in an
antacid. Thus, although on average an antacid tablet may
provide less calcium than a calcium supplement, and usage
patterns may differ (e.g., antacids taken intermittently but
perhaps several times per day vs. daily calcium supplement
use), these data show that calcium-containing antacid intake
is important to consider when assessing total calcium intake.
Current interest in the associations of calcium intake with a
variety of chronic diseases (22­28) underscores the impor-
tance of accurate total calcium intake assessment.

The NHANES data collection procedure allows some
examination of misreporting of dietary supplements. Despite
instructions to report prescription supplements as dietary
supplements, 204 of the 5,299 supplements taken by adults
were recorded as prescription medicines, not supplements.
Such omissions could contribute to underreporting in studies
of supplement use. Conversely, some foods and drinks,
particularly vitamin- and mineral-fortified ones, were
reported as supplements. Despite the definition of supple-
ments provided by the Dietary Supplement Health and

Education Act (1) and additional depiction by the US Food
and Drug Administration (29), the line between supplements
and foods or drinks seems unclear and may be a source of
over- or underreporting of supplement use in surveys. For
surveys that cannot collect data in as much detail as
NHANES can, it may help reduce such misreporting to
instruct participants to include prescription supplements and
exclude sports and other fortified drinks and foods or, if time
permits, to ask about these separately, before supplements.
Implications of findings for study analysis
Because these data come from a survey that yields a
nationally representative sample and calculates respondent
sampling weights to account for nonresponse and other
selection factors, the results provide estimates of dietary
supplement use in the past month for the total US civilian
noninstitutionalized population and by various demographic
and lifestyle characteristics. The associations observed can
be used to inform the design, analysis, and interpretation of
nonrepresentative studies of supplement use. For example,
for the most commonly used supplements and for any
supplement use, bivariate results (tables 1 and 2) show that
older age, higher educational level, physical activity, race/
ethnicity, and never smoking were associated with higher
use of all of these supplement types, while other lifestyle/
demographic characteristics were associated with only some
supplement types. With multivariable control (table 3), some
associations were no longer evident, such as those of race/
ethnicity with B-complex vitamins and calcium, smoking
with all supplement types except vitamin E and calcium, and
physical exercise with vitamin C. These findings suggest
that the prevalence rates for specific supplements from
nonrepresentative populations could be biased differentially
for different supplement types as well as for total supplement
use.
Additionally, the associations found between supplement
use and demographic/lifestyle characteristics stress the diffi-
culty in interpreting results of observational studies of these
characteristics or of dietary supplement use with health.
Statistical associations between health conditions and
supplement use or demographic/lifestyle characteristics may
result from confounding rather than reflect a true biologic
association. The high prevalence of supplement use and the
strength of some of the associations with demographic/life-
style variables seen in our analyses suggest including all of
these variables in studies of nutrient intake, demographics,
and lifestyle with health.
