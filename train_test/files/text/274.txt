Substance Abuse by Youth and Young Adults
in Rural America
David Lambert, PhD;1 John A. Gale, MS;1 and David Hartley, PhD1
ABSTRACT: Purpose: Addressing substance abuse in
rural America requires extending our understanding
beyond urban-rural comparisons to how substance abuse
varies across rural communities of different sizes. We
address this gap by examining substance abuse prevalence
across 4 geographic levels, focusing on youth (age 12-17
years) and young adults (age 18-25 years). Methods: The
analysis is based on 3 years (2002-2004) of pooled data
from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We
measure rurality using a four-tier consolidation of the
2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes: urban,
rural-adjacent, rural-large, and rural-small and medium.
Findings: Rural youth have higher alcohol use and
methamphetamine use than urban youth and the more
rural the area, the higher the use. Rural young adults
living in rural-large areas have higher rates of substance
abuse than their urban peers; those living in the most
rural areas have nearly twice the rate of methamphetamine
use as urban young adults. Rural youth are more likely
than urban youth to have engaged in the high-risk
behavior of driving under the influence of alcohol or other
illicit drugs. Conclusions: Higher prevalence rates,
coupled with high-risk behavior, place rural youth and
young adults at risk of continued substance use and
problems associated with this use. Rural community
infrastructure should be enhanced to support substance
abuse prevention and intervention for these populations.
The increased use and impact of
methamphetamine (meth) over
the past decade have led county law officials
to declare it America's top drug problem.1
Meth use started in California several
decades ago and has spread steadily eastward, reaching
high levels in a number of states that are largely rural.
As a result, meth is often described as a "rural
problem."2-4 Depicting meth as a rural issue has helped
to focus attention on an important problem. This
should also renew interest in other substances abused
in rural America, including alcohol, marijuana, and
cocaine. These substances are more prevalent than
meth, have significant clinical and social impact, and
are associated with the use of other drugs, particularly
among youth and younger adults.5
Although there is more research today on rural
substance abuse than 5 or 10 years ago, there is a major
limitation to much of this work: it compares all rural
areas to all urban areas or to different size urban areas.
Because substance abuse is a public health problem that
affects certain high-risk populations more than others, a
population health approach, focusing on differences
among sub-populations, is appropriate.6 The literature
is clear that youth and young adults are at higher risk
of substance abuse than older age groups.7,8 A more
limited literature suggests that rural youth and young
adults may be at higher risk of abuse of some
substances than urban youth and young adults and that
this risk varies by size of rural community.9 If we are to
develop effective substance abuse prevention and
intervention programs for rural youth and young

adults, we must first better understand where (which
type of rural areas) the need for these programs is the
highest.
This study seeks to take a first, but important, step
toward understanding variations in substance abuse by
size of rural community by examining substance abuse
prevalence across 4 geographic levels--urban,
rural-adjacent, rural-large, and rural small and
medium--based on 3 years (2002-2004) of pooled data
from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH). We examine substance use by youth (age
12-17 years ), young adults (age 18-25 years), and for all
persons 12 and older. We focus on youth and young
adults because they have the highest rates of substance
use and are the population for whom development of
effective community intervention programs
(prevention and treatment) may be most urgent.
Background
Prevalence of Rural Substance Abuse. Our
understanding of substance abuse in Rural America has
changed over time. For many years an assumption
persisted that rural communities were more nurturing
than urban areas and offered more protection against
substance abuse.10 Over the last decade, several major
studies and reports have found that rather than being a
safe haven, rural areas experience significant rates of
substance abuse, although somewhat lower than in
urban areas.7,10,11 Considering the population as a
whole (age 12 years and older), urban areas have higher
rates than rural areas of alcohol use and abuse and illicit
drug use. Rural youth (age 12-17 years), however, have
higher rates of alcohol use and binge-drinking and are
more likely to use other illicit drugs, except marijuana,
than urban youth. Urban young adults (age 18-25 years)
have higher rates of alcohol and marijuana use than
rural young adults. Rural-urban differences in illicit
drug use by young adults vary by type of drug.8 The
literature is consistent in its findings, but is based on
broad rural-urban comparisons. There are suggestions
within this literature of intra-rural variations, but these
variations have not been systematically examined.8,9
Geographical differences in substance abuse, both
across regions of the country and within individual
states, have been found using the NSDUH survey
data.9,12-14 The 2004 NSDUH survey found that past
month alcohol use among persons 12-20 years was
highest in the Northeast (32.3%), and lower in the
Midwest (31.4%), West (27.3%), and South (26.2%). The
substance abuse literature suggests significant variation
by race and ethnicity, but this variation is generally not
broken down further by rurality (Note 1).12
The Rural Context of Substance Abuse. Substance
use in rural areas is influenced by both location
(population and proximity to urban areas of influence)
and place (cultural, demographic, and economic
factors).15 Adjacency of rural to urban areas is
important because of the influence that urban areas
may have on rural areas in terms of increasing the
supply of drugs, providing educational and economic
opportunities, and promoting cultural influences. (For
some types of drugs, trafficking of drugs may be
bi-directional between smaller and larger rural areas.)
The interplay among these factors may place residents
of adjacent rural areas at relatively more or less risk of
substance abuse than other rural or urban residents.
The economic downturn in much of rural America
(starting with the Farm Crisis of the 1980s) has resulted
in economic disadvantage and stress that are strongly
associated with substance abuse and other social
problems (eg, low school and educational attainment,
unemployment).5,15 The similarity in prevalence of
substance abuse and associated problems in very
economically depressed rural areas to economically
depressed inner cities led Davidson16 to coin the phrase
"America's Rural Ghetto" (Note 2). Constrained
economic opportunities have contributed to an aging of
rural America, with significant out-migration of
younger persons.17 This may result in younger adults
remaining in rural areas who are less educated and less
likely to be working or earning a living wage than their
peers who moved away, placing the "stay-at-home"
group at higher risk for substance abuse.15
Data and Methods
The data used in this study come from the 2002,
2003, and 2004 National Survey of Drug Use and
Health, conducted annually by the US Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, Office of
Applied Studies. Slightly fewer than 70,000 randomly
selected individuals, age 12 years and older, are
surveyed every year, approximately 17% of whom live
in rural areas. This survey measures the prevalence and
correlates of alcohol and other drug use in the United
States. The sample design supports the development of
national, state and regional estimates. The design of the
NSDUH allowed us to pool multiple consecutive years,
thereby creating a sufficiently large sample size to
compare substance use across the rural-urban
continuum. Pooling the data in this manner to examine
substance abuse across different size rural areas has
been done only on a very limited and occasional basis
by the Office of Applied Studies at SAMHSA.8,9
Through an arrangement with the Office of
Applied Studies, we were able to access the NSDUH

analytic files rather than the more limited public use
files available through the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Data Archive (Note 3 and Note 4). The analytic
files contain the full nine-tiered Rural-Urban
Continuum Codes upon which our analysis is based,
whereas the public use files contain a more limited
classification structure (ie, large-metropolitan,
small-metropolitan, and non-metropolitan statistical
counties).
Measuring Rural and Urban Areas. We measure
rurality using a four-tier consolidation of the 2003
Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). The RUCC
subdivide the Office of Management and Budget
classification of metro and non-metro counties into 3
metro and 6 non-metro groupings (Note 5). This
scheme distinguishes metropolitan counties by
population size of their metro areas and
non-metropolitan counties by the size of their largest
cities or towns and their proximity to a metro area(s).18
In this study we combine the 3 metro groupings into a
single category, referred to as urban, and the 6
non-metro groupings into 3 categories, referred to as
rural, resulting in the following four-tier classification:
Urban consists of metropolitan counties in metropolitan
areas of any population size; Rural­Adjacent consists of
non-metro counties with any mix of urban and rural
populations adjacent to a metro area; Rural­Large
consists of non-metro counties with urban population
of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area; and
Rural­Medium/Small consists of non-metro counties
with urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to
a metro area (medium), as well as non-metro counties
that are completely rural or have fewer than 2,500
urban population, not adjacent to a metro area (small).
We consolidated the RUCC in this manner because
our primary interest was to examine variations in the
prevalence of substance use across different types of
rural areas and compare each rural category with the
urban population (Note 6). We wanted to be able to
examine the rural adjacent areas, separate from
non-adjacent rural areas, because adjacent areas
typically have a higher degree of social and economic
integration with the adjoining urban areas19 and have
lower levels of poverty, higher economic performance,
and greater in-migration patterns than rural
non-adjacent counties.20-22 These factors are likely to
influence the level and patterns of substance abuse.5 We
combined medium and small rural county categories
into one category given the relatively small sample size
and relatively low prevalence rates for some substances
in small rural counties (Note 7).
Age was examined in terms of 3 categories: youth
(age 12-17 years), young adults (age 18-25 years), and
all respondents (age 12 years and older). We focused
our analysis on youth and young adults because the
literature suggests it is these groups that tend to be the
higher users of many substances and they, therefore,
may be at risk for impaired life chances and prospects
from substance abuse.
Measures of Substance Use. We examined the use
of 6 commonly abused substances: alcohol, marijuana,
cocaine, inhalants, methamphetamine, and OxyContin.
The first 4 substances have long histories of use and
abuse and significantly impact the lives and well-being
of those using them. Methamphetamine and OxyContin
have emerged more recently and have been widely
reported to pose significant problems for rural youth
and young adults. These 6 substances are reported in
terms of past-year use. Although past month use is a
preferred measure of recent substance use, the typically
lower past month prevalence rates limit the sample size
available to conduct our analyses. We used past-year
rather than past-month use to ensure sufficient cell size
to make comparisons across geographic categories for
all 6 substances. Two additional measures of alcohol
use are reported: binge-drinking (5 drinks on a single
occasion one or more times in the past month) and
heavy drinking (participated in binge-drinking 5 or
more times in the past month). Finally, we report the
prevalence of driving under the influence in the past
year, in terms of alcohol only and any illicit drug or
alcohol (illicit drugs include marijuana, cocaine,
inhalants, hallucinogens [including LSD, PCP, or
Ecstasy], heroin, or non-medical use of
psychotherapeutics, which include stimulants,
sedatives, tranquilizers, and pain relievers).

respondents to the NSDUH for 2002-2004, by
geographic area and by age category.
Analysis. To protect the confidentiality of NSDUH
respondents (given the need for the full geographic
identifier), we developed an arrangement with
SAMHSA that gave us access to the results of our
analyses without having direct access to the full
analytic data files. The data runs for the analyses
reported in this article were conducted by the Research
Triangle Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC), which
is under contract to the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration to maintain the
NSDUH database using standard suppression criteria
developed for analysis of the NSDUH. The authors
developed the analysis plan. File construction and
programming were done jointly by the authors and the
Research Triangle Institute. Significance tests are

Findings
Prevalence. Overall, all persons aged 12 years and
older living in urban areas report past-year use of
alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana slightly more often
than persons living in rural areas (Table 2). However,

different use patterns emerge when the data are
analyzed for individual age groups. Rural youth (age
12-17 years) in all 3 rural categories have higher rates of
past year use of alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine,
and inhalants than urban youth. That rural youth use
alcohol and illicit drugs other than marijuana at higher
rates than urban youth has been previously
established.10,11 Table 2 confirms and extends these
findings: youth in all 3 categories of rural areas use
these substances (with the exception of marijuana and
OxyContin in small/medium rural areas) at greater
rates than youth in urban areas. Methamphetamine and

alcohol use are higher in rural than in urban areas, and
the more rural the area, the higher the use. The use of
marijuana and cocaine among youth is greatest in large
rural and rural­adjacent areas. Although comparisons
were not statistically significant for inhalant and
OxyContin use (likely due to small sample size and
prevalence rates), they show patterns of higher use in
rural than in urban areas.
Some, but not all, rural young adults have higher
alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana use than their urban
peers (Table 2). Past-year use of each of these
substances is highest in large rural areas, next highest
in urban areas, lower in rural­adjacent areas, and
lowest in rural­small/medium areas. The difference in
past-year alcohol use by young adults in rural­large
and in urban areas is statistically significant (P < .05).
However, the differences in past-year cocaine and
marijuana use by young adults living in rural-large and
in urban areas are not statistically significant. In
contrast to alcohol, cocaine and marijuana, the use of
methamphetamine and OxyContin by young adults
increases across the urban-rural continuum with the
highest use in small/medium rural areas. These
differences (overall and specific rural-urban
comparisons) are statistically significant for
methamphetamine but not for OxyContin. (The lack of
significance for OxyContin use may reflect the small
sample size resulting from OxyContin being included
as a separate substance for the first time in the 2004
survey.) The depiction of methamphetamine as a
problem for rural areas appears to be well founded:
young adults living in the most rural (small/medium)

areas use methamphetamine at nearly twice the rate of
their urban peers (2.9% vs 1.5%, P < .001).
High-Risk Behavior. The frequency of substance
use is an important indicator of the potential
seriousness and consequence of substance use. Table 3
presents rates of binge-drinking (having 5 drinks or
more on a single occasion within the past month) and
heavy-drinking (having participated in binge-drinking
5 or more times in the past month). The general pattern
of use, by age group and across level of rurality, is
similar to the patterns for any alcohol use in the past
year shown in Table 2. With the exception of
binge-drinking rates by youth in large rural areas, rates
of youth binge and heavy drinking increase with degree
of rurality with the highest rates found in the most
rural (rural­small/medium) areas (15.0%, P < .001 and
4.1%, P < .001, respectively). Young adults living in
rural-large areas have the highest rates of binge-
drinking (48.0%, P < .01) and heavy drinking (20.0%,
P < .05).
Rural youth are more likely to have driven in the
past year while under the influence of alcohol or illicit
drugs, or alcohol only, than youth in urban areas
(Table 4). The more rural the community, the more
likely young persons are to have driven under the
influence. Over a quarter of all young adults reported
having driven under the influence of either alcohol or
an illicit drug during the past year (Table 4). The
intra-rural differences are not as large for young adults
as for youth. The lowest rates of driving under the
influence are found in rural­adjacent areas; higher rates

Limitations. Under the data analysis arrangement,
we did not have direct access to the data files, limiting
our ability to conduct follow-up analyses. As a result,
this study is an important, but exploratory, analysis of
intra-rural variation in substance abuse. There are
several limitations to our study, which arise from the
need to preserve sufficient cell-size to conduct our
analyses. We used a four-tier classification to measure
rurality. Without the cell-size constraint, we would
have explored using multiple categories of urban (eg,
large metropolitan, small metropolitan) and separate
categories for rural­medium and rural-small areas.
Although past-month use is a preferred measure of
recent substance use, we measured substance-abuse
prevalence in terms of past-year use to ensure sufficient
cell size to conduct our analysis. Finally, we were not
able to explore regional and racial/ethnic differences in
prevalence within the framework of our analysis
because cell sizes would not be large enough across all
comparisons to conduct the analysis.
Discussion
Until a decade ago the literature suggested, and
policymakers assumed, that substance abuse was lower
in rural than urban populations. Over the last decade,
research has shown that among all ages substance
abuse is slightly lower in rural than in urban areas and
that alcohol and illicit drug use, other than marijuana,
is higher among rural than urban youth. What was not
known was how substance use varied across different
levels of rurality and how the use of more powerful and
increasingly prevalent drugs, such as OxyContin and
methamphetamine, differed between rural and urban
areas and across different levels of rurality.
The data in this study show that rural youth (12-17
years) and young adults (18-25 years) have high
prevalence rates in the use of a number of substances.
In general, substance use by youth is highest in
rural­small/medium areas and highest for young
adults in rural large-non-adjacent areas. While we were
not able to explore these differences within the current
study, it is possible to speculate on this pattern. For
youth, there may be fewer alternatives for recreation
and higher sources of stress in the most rural and
isolated areas. Young adults may move from smaller to
larger areas either for college, work, or both. Young
adults living in rural large-non-adjacent areas may
have "stayed at-home" and not moved to rural-adjacent
or urban areas.
While some of the geographic differences reported
in this study are modest, and the prevalence rates for
some substances such as meth are small, these
differences are significant both statistically and from a
policy perspective. Overall, these prevalence rates,
coupled with high-risk behavior (eg, binge-drinking,
heavy drinking, and driving under the influence) place
rural youth and young adults at risk of continued
substance use and substance use-related injuries. Rural
America's youth and young adults have a substance
abuse problem that needs to be addressed.
Where do we start? The Carsey Institute's recent
report "Substance Abuse in Rural and Small Town
America" notes the need for alcohol prevention and
treatment programs for rural youth and the need to
begin to address the meth problem in rural areas.11 The
latter is a daunting challenge given the scarcity of rural
substance abuse prevention and treatment services.
Developing intervention programs for youth alcohol

abuse is a logical and important starting place. Alcohol
use is, by far, the most commonly abused substance,
often co-occurs with the use of illicit drugs, and is
correlated with poor school performance and social
problems. It is also important to address meth and
other illicit drug use among rural youth and young
adults, particularly given the prevalence and likely
consequence of use of these substances.
Rather than craft intervention policies and
programs one substance at a time, it is important to
consider what can be done to enhance the
infrastructure of rural communities to support
substance abuse prevention and early intervention for
rural youth and young adults. One way to do this is by
adapting best practice and model prevention programs
to rural areas. While progress has been made in
identifying such practices and programs,23 we need to
understand how to implement them and make them
work in diverse rural communities. Environmental
prevention strategies tailored to the unique cultural,
economic, and geographic realities of rural
communities should be developed and evaluated.24
This is particularly important for the most rural areas,
which have the highest rates of youth alcohol and meth
use and young adult meth use. These areas face the
greatest challenge, from a law enforcement perspective,
from a prevention perspective, and from a treatment
perspective, due to low population density, limited
resources stretched over large geographic areas (Note 8)
and, in many cases, patterns of poverty,
unemployment, and declining economic sectors.
Pooling three consecutive years of data with
discrete geographic identifiers enabled us to conduct
the intra-rural analysis reported in this article. We
recommend that the NSDUH, which is conducted every
year, continue to be used in this manner and that the
full analytic file with geographic identifiers be made
available to other external researchers, with proper
safeguards for quality and confidentiality. A number of
important questions should be examined. To what
extent do observed intra-rural differences in prevalence
vary by major region of the country? To what extent do
they vary by major ethnic and cultural groups? To what
extent are they explained by underlying demographic
characteristics? What are the intra-rural differences in
alcohol and co-occurring drug use? To what extent do
they vary by major ethnic and cultural group and by
region? Understanding regional, ethnic, and
demographic differences is critical in developing
culturally competent intervention programs.
Addressing the shortage of health and social
services in rural America is a long and vexing
problem.25,26 Developing a coordinated substance abuse
policy in the United States has been a similarly uphill
struggle.27 However, the increased attention in policy
and research circles to both rural health and substance
abuse suggests that we can begin to address
systematically substance abuse by rural youth and
young adults.
Endnotes
Note 1. The 2004 NSDUH reported that Native
Americans/Alaska Natives had the highest past-month
rates of illicit drug use (12.3%), followed by African
Americans (8.7%), whites (8.1%), Hispanics (7.2%), and
Asians (3.1%).7 There is significant variation among
different Hispanic sub-groups. Most of the research on
substance abuse by African Americans has focused on
alcohol use (which tends to be lower among African
American youth than other ethnic groups), but tends
not to be specific to, or broken down by, rurality.13
Note 2. Subsequent reports and studies have lent
support to Davidson's conceptualization. A 1994 U.S.
News and World Report article28 reported by Conger15
described Waterloo, Iowa, as one of the rural
communities that include a growing white underclass,
as identified by having more than 40% of its population
living below the poverty line and having high rates of
crime, domestic violence, single-headed households,
and inter-generational poverty.
Note 3. Our agreement with the Office of Applied
Studies did not provide us with direct access to the data
but to results of data runs on the full analytic file based
on our specifications. Our project liaison at the
Research Triangle Institute (SAMHSA's contractor on
this project) ran the analyses on the full analytic file
according to our specifications.
Note 4. The public use files have been modified to
protect the privacy of respondents by eliminating
and/or collapsing geographic and other variables that
could be used to identify individual respondents and
randomly eliminating approximately 12,500 records per
year through a sampling sub-step that maintains the
integrity of the public use data file.
Note 5. The 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes
are based on the 2000 Census. The 3 metropolitan
(metro) county groupings are (1) counties in metro areas
of 1 million population or more; (2) counties in metro
areas of 250,000 to 1 million population; (3) counties in
metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population. The 6
non-metropolitan (non-metro) groupings are (4) urban
population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area;
(5) urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to
a metro area; (6) urban population of 2,500 to 19,999,
adjacent to a metro area; (7) urban population of 2,500
to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area; (8) completely
rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a

metro area; (9) completely rural or less than 2,500 urban
population, not adjacent to a metro area.
Note 6. A similar classification was used in a study
of heavy and binge-drinking using Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System data.29
Note 7. Exploration of the data revealed that small
sample size and low prevalence triggered the NSDUH
suppression criteria for many of the cells in the analysis
of small/isolated as well as the medium rural counties.
As a result, we were unable to compare differences
across these 2 categories of rural counties, leading us to
combine the small/isolated and medium rural
categories to achieve sufficient cell size to report use of
the substances included in this study.
Note 8. As with health and human services more
generally, there are fewer substance abuse prevention
and treatment services in rural than in urban areas.13
