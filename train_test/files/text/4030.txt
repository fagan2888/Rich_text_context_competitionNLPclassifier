Abstract
This article describes the context and development of the new Nurse Practitioner Standards for Practice in Australia, which
went into effect in January 2014. The researchers used a mixed-methods design to engage a broad range of stakeholders who
brought both political and practice knowledge to the development of the new standards. Methods included interviews, focus
groups, surveys, and work-based observation of nurse practitioner practice. Stakeholders varied in terms of their need for
detail in the standards. Nonetheless, they invariably agreed that the standards should be clinically focussed attributes. The
pillars common in many advanced practice nursing standards, such as practice, research, education, and leadership, were
combined and expressed in a new and unique clinical attribute.

In July 2010, Australia moved to a national registration
process for all health practitioners under the auspices of
the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency
(AHPRA) and encompassing several regulatory boards,
including the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia
(NMBA). The NMBA commissioned the drafting of the
second version of the Standards for Practice for the
Nurse Practitioner (NP) in 2012, with the aim of revising
the standards to reflect contemporary and actual prac-
tice. The authors of this article constituted the team
involved in the development of the NP standards. We
present it here as an example of policy formation in
which policy makers (NMBA) translated their visions
of NP practice into a format that guides delivery of
care to achieve desired population outcomes (Smith-
Merry, Gillespie, & Leeder, 2007).

Policy making can be framed as a drama that includes
a synthesis of evidence to make plausible arguments
(Greenhalgh & Russell, 2006). The evidence required to
form effective policies includes, but is not limited to,
results of empirical studies (Bernier & Clavier, 2011).
Successful policy formation can also be based on synthe-
sis of evidence developed through the three lenses of pol-
itical knowledge, research-based knowledge, and field
experience (Head, 2008). This article draws from evi-
dence in each of these lenses. The evidence that guided
our development of the NP standards included a review
of the literature, interviews with policy stakeholders,
focus groups with consumers, public consultation, and
work-based observation of NP practice. We first ana-
lyzed findings from these different sources of evidence
and then synthesized the findings with a focus on revising
the NP standards.
The health policy triangle, which emphasizes the inter-
action of context, process, and content in forming health
policy (Walt & Gibson, 1994), provides the framework
for this research. Policy has multiple dimensions; this
article presents the outcomes that one might use to evalu-
ate the NP standards' success, failure, and effectiveness
(McConnell, 2010).
Background
Credentialing for advanced practice nursing (APN)
varies among nations. Pulcini, Jelic, Gul, and Loke
(2010) surveyed 32 countries and found that 23 formally
recognized the NP or APN role (Pulcini et al., 2010). Of
these 23 countries, 11 (48%) had requirements for licen-
sure maintenance, registration, or renewal (Pulcini et al.,
2010). International definitions of advanced nursing prac-
tice (ANP) identify characteristics of advanced practice,
expanded scope of practice, generality or specificity of
practice, and sometimes the level of education required
(e.g., master's degree; Stasa, Cashin, Buckley, &
Donoghue, 2014).
Context
In Australia, NP is a regulated title requiring endorse-
ment by the NMBA. Applicants who have completed an
approved and required master's education programs of
study and can document 5,000 hours of advanced prac-
tice are eligible to apply for endorsement as NPs. NMBA
staffs assess the applications against the Australian NP
Standards for Practice to determine a candidate's eligi-
bility for NP endorsement (Nursing and Midwifery
Board of Australia [NMBA], 2013).
The first National Competency Standards for the NP
(now replaced by the Australian NP Standards for
Practice) were commissioned by the Australian and
Nursing Midwifery Council (ANMC) and published in
2004 (Gardner, Carryer, Dunn, & Gardner, 2004). At that
time, 15 NPs participated in the research and development
of the initial NP competencies. Although the number of
NPs endorsed at the time of the release of the new stand-
ards is not published, as of June 2014, there were 1,087
endorsed NPs in Australia (NMBA, 2014).
In Australia, one set of NP standards is used for a
range of regulatory, educational, employment, and
monitoring purposes, irrespective of an NP's specialty,
population focus, or geographic locale. The standards
also guide the development of curricula for NP master's
education programs (Australian Nursing and Midwifery
Council [ANMC], 2009). Additionally, standards assist
NPs in defining and validating their individual scopes of
practice. Standards also enable evaluation of individual
NP performance and inform other professionals and
health consumers about NPs' capabilities and scopes of
practice. The multipurpose NP standards in Australia
mean that revision required a generic approach to con-
tent rather than a practice specialty or population focus.
With this in mind, the major aim of the research project
described in this article was to analyze the gap between
Australia's existing 2004 National Competency
Standards for the NP and actual NP practice. A
second aim was to use a structured consultative and
iterative process to develop a provisional set of revised
Australian NP Standards for Practice.
The project consisted of three distinct phases: (a)
literature review, consultation, and synthesis; (b) gap
analysis and public consultation; and (c) validation of
the revised standards (see Figure 1). Each phase had a
distinct purpose and set of methods and built iteratively
on the findings of the preceding one. Phases 1 and 2
encompassed ongoing engagement of stakeholders;
Phase 3 was designed to ensure that the developed stand-
ards were applicable to actual NP practice. Although the
research team conducted an extensive literature review to
inform the process, Phases 1 and 2 largely refer to the
work conducted through the lenses of political know-
ledge, and practical and professional field experience
(Head, 2008).
The institutional Human Research Ethics committees
of both the University of Sydney and Southern Cross
University approved the study. The validation phase of
the project was undertaken in all of Australia's six states
and two territories.
Phase 1: Literature Review, Consultation,
and Synthesis
The first phase--consultation and synthesis--consisted
of a literature review, telephone interviews, and focus
groups. The literature review covered peer-reviewed
and gray literature articles published from 2004 to 2013
in Australian and international publications, with special
28 Policy, Politics, & Nursing Practice 16(1­2)
reference to countries with an identifiable NP role.
Topics surveyed included NP role, scope of practice,
competency and standards, and legal requirements. The
terms advanced practice nursing, advanced nursing prac-
tice, scope of practice, and extended practice were
searched separately in CINAHL, Medline, and
PubMed online databases. The pearl-growing strategy
was utilized, where lists of references were searched to
locate additional articles not picked up in the original
search (Harter, 1986). The research team also reviewed
variations in practice among jurisdictions (e.g., national
and state) or sectors (e.g., public health system and pri-
mary care), the impact of employment arrangements on
role and scope of practice, and relevant legislation and
regulations. The results of the review were published sep-
arately (Stasa et al., 2014). The major finding was the
great variability in the use of basic terms related to
advanced practice in nursing internationally and at
times within countries. This imprecise use of language
has promoted confusion within the profession and the
public at large.
The second part of Phase 1 consisted of 17 1-hr
telephone interviews with six chief nurses, five profes-
sional officers in state and territory health departments,
and six AHPRA staff from South Australia, Western
Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South
Wales. The sample consisted of those who responded
to a formal invitation to all state and territory depart-
ments to participate. The interviews sought information
on how the existing NP standards were used, particular
challenges with any item or wording, components of the
existing standards that should be retained, and changes
to improve the standards' usability. All interviews were
audiotaped and transcribed for subsequent analysis.
Another data source during this first phase was a
working group discussion among 48 NPs who responded
to an invitation to participate at the annual Australian
College of Nurse Practitioners conference in 2012.
A research team member facilitated smaller groups,
undertaking a detailed examination of each standard,
its wording, and identification of content potentially
requiring revision. The subgroups reported their feed-
back to the whole group for broad discussion concerning
the recommended changes.
Phase 1 Findings
Findings from interviews and focus groups with relevant
stakeholders revealed five key themes: (a) use of lan-
guage, (b) level of behaviors, (c) expression of attributes
in guiding NP behaviors, (d) use of the standards, and (e)
scope of NP practice. Each of these findings is discussed
in more detail, below.
Use of language for NP standards. Informants reported that
the standards required modernization and rewording, so
that consumers and others, such as clinicians and health
administrators, could clearly understand them. Feedback

from one NP, who expressed the sentiments of many
others, indicated that the language was "too wordy,
vague and unclear in places and a number of the compe-
tencies are repeated." Interviewees who utilized the
standards to determine suitability to practice reported
that the existing standards lacked clarity as some word-
ing was difficult to understand. Some participants
reported that use of the word autonomous in the stand-
ards was problematic, particularly for professionals in
other disciplines who think that nursing should be part
of a collaborative arrangement of patient care.
The notion of collaboration was important to many
NPs who considered they made decisions within a team.
However, these views were not unanimous, and other
participants expressed that there should be a focus on
the independent and autonomous role of the NP. Some
NPs considered that language used obscured other
health professionals' understanding of the NP role,
which potentially made certain NP practices (like
prescribing and referrals) unnecessarily challenging.
The references to a nursing model in the previous stand-
ards were reported as not clearly understood as what this
meant was not clearly articulated.
Interpretation of the level of behaviors in the
standards. Interviewees responsible for evaluating
applications for NP endorsement asserted that appli-
cants generally provided insufficient evidence of
advanced practice behavior, particularly in the attributes
of leadership, education, and research. Interviewees also
reported that applicants demonstrated knowledge gaps
in what constituted advanced practice evidence. They
suggested that the standards needed to clearly distinguish
the difference between NP and registered nurse (RN)
practice, which in turn will guide NP candidates.
Participants suggested that standards needed to accom-
modate the reality that an NP might be an expert in one
area but not others. Most members of the NP focus
group suggested that the standards needed to articulate
the knowledge requirements for working as an NP.
It was suggested that NPs may have skills in the same
areas as RNs (e.g., clinical, research, ethics), but the level
of knowledge of the NP must be more comprehensive,
far-reaching, detailed, and sophisticated.
Expression of attributes to guide NP behaviors. Several inter-
viewees responsible for policy formation and implemen-
tation commented that some components of the NP role
were not clearly expressed in the previous standards.
Leadership was considered to be challenging for NPs
to demonstrate, even within their own organization.
NP participants also expressed that clinical leadership
was a key aspect of the role. Other interviewees asserted
that some NPs have difficulty articulating their role to
other health professionals and that they lack political
astuteness and a working understanding of legal require-
ments. The evolved standards were seen as necessary to
create an organizing framework for representing current
NP clinical practice.
Nurse leaders recommended that research require-
ments be elucidated more clearly. They suggested that
the interpretation of research in the revised standards
includes clinical audit and highlighted the importance
of NPs assuming responsibility for self-auditing their
practice. The leaders relayed the need for NPs to under-
stand the healthcare system's funding and financial
structures.
Focus group participants also discussed the import-
ance of NPs as educators. Most clarified that this meant
serving as role models and mentors to other nurses and
health professionals, as opposed to referring only to
didactic classroom-based academic education.
Use of the standards by NPs. Study participants agreed that
standards and competencies are useful guidelines for
determining minimum expectations for novice NPs and
that with experience in the new NP scope, their practice
will develop beyond the minimum standards.
Participants stated that consistency in practice was
important to give consumers confidence in NP practice
capabilities.
Many NP focus group participants said that the
standards are important as a framework for their scope
of practice, but as one NP said they did not use them, on
a day-to-day basis. Some of the NPs suggested that a
move from the abstract organizing pillars of the previous
standards to more clinically focussed standards was
desirable.
Scope of practice. There was general consensus that NP
applicants need a set of agreed core attributes for use
by all NPs, whatever their specialty. Some participants
advised that these generalist NP standards should build
on the NMBA RN standards with the addition of NP-
specific competencies. One NP commented that, "NPs
should have a generalist capacity within their specialty"
and that "if standards are too fixed they will quickly
become outdated given the shortage of health workforce
staff that is predicted for the future." A strong theme
emerged from the interviews that NPs were, in fact, not
necessarily more specialized in their practice than RNs
but indeed were specialists who had built up a broad
generalist base.
Another key theme identified from interviewees was
the difficulties NPs had in providing evidence of
advanced practice and that to facilitate the process def-
initional clarity was needed between ANP and APN,
terms sometimes used interchangeably and other times
with discrete difference (Stasa et al., 2014). Following
completion of Phase 1, the authors, based on findings
30 Policy, Politics, & Nursing Practice 16(1­2)
from the literature review, the telephone interviews, and
the NP working group, developed the revised draft
standards.
Phase 2: Gap Analysis and Public Consultation
Phase 2 focused on the revised draft of the standards
undertaken through interviews and focus groups. The
same stakeholders as in Phase 1 were included, augmented
by academics (Australian Council of Deans of Nursing
and Midwifery), a sample of 32 healthcare consumers
and a 10-week public consultation.
Consumer and Carer Focus Groups
Six health consumer focus groups were conducted in
urban and rural locations across Australia, including
Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland,
Canberra, and South Australia. Thirty-two consumers
participated for approximately 1 hr in group discussions
facilitated by a project team member.
Several weeks before each focus group was scheduled,
participants were sent a copy of the revised standards.
This approach was taken to provide participants
sufficient time to review the provisional standards and
identify words or concepts that were problematic prior
to the group session. Participants' responses to prompt
questions were audiotaped for three focus groups and
recorded by hand-written notes for the other three
groups. These six focus groups explored participants'
knowledge of the role of the NP based on what was
written in the standards. This included their understand-
ing of the language used, identification of whether they
would use the services of an NP, and reasons for their
decision. Using an inductive process, the data were the-
matically analyzed by the research team (Hsieh &
Shannon, 2005). Team members individually analyzed
the notes and electronic data from the six groups. The
team then collated shared findings. Some themes were
merged and others collapsed as they became redundant.
The team then reanalyzed the information to look for
data that affirmed or disrupted the thematic analysis.
The process of analysis continued until consensus was
reached.
Key Findings From Consumer Focus Groups
When consumers were asked if they knew what an NP
was, the majority were unsure. A few did know about the
NP role because they had used walk-in clinics managed
by NPs in Australia. However, most did not understand
the difference between different titles of nurses (specific-
ally NPs, practice nurses, registered or enrolled nurses;
see Table 4), even though some participants said they
knew which tasks nurses working in general
practitioner's clinics undertook. Generally, participants
could not explain the difference between the practice
nurse and the NP. Additionally, participants did not
know whether the practice nurse was a registered or
enrolled nurse.
Consumer focus group participants thought that the
NP role as described in the standards would be most
useful in rural and remote locations or in after-hour set-
tings, in which physician access was poor. However,
when consumers were questioned further about the NP
role, some did not know that an NP could order diag-
nostic tests and interpret the results. One participant
said, "NPs are like the nurses in the United States of
America who can diagnose and treat people." Some par-
ticipants were unaware that an NP service operated in
their locale. Most participants did not know that NPs
could prescribe medication within their scope of practice
and refer patients to other services. Some said they
would have used the NP services if they had known.
Consumer group participants stated that if consumers
are to use the standards, then the language needs to be
easily understood. Another point that consumers made
was that NPs need to detail and promote their work to
the public and clarify what NPs do that differentiates
them from RNs.
Along with the need for plain and unambiguous lan-
guage, focus group participants expressed how standards
needed to move from the abstract organizational frame
of leadership, research, education, and practice, to a
more concrete clinically applicable format that repre-
sented NP interactions with patients.
Consultation and Feedback
Two types of consultation were conducted by the
authors to receive feedback on the next draft of the
standards: a month-long preliminary consultation with
employees and key NMBA stakeholders; followed by a
10-week public consultation using a structured response
survey. A limited amount of feedback (responses n ¼ 10)
was received from the internal the AHPRA consultation.
The key feedback points were:
. Strengthen areas such as professional development,
education/teaching, leadership, and research. One
respondent commented that within the professional,
education, and teaching realm, NPs should meet the
registration requirement for their own continuing pro-
fessional development. Another respondent suggested,
"a nurse at this level should be teaching others, speak-
ing at professional forums, conferences and contribut-
ing to the teaching of undergraduates, newly graduated
nurses, and nurses developing specialty skills."
. Within the leadership domain, it was suggested that
NPs be active in professional associations and forums
Cashin et al. 31
and contribute to the development of policy, proced-
ure, and practice guidelines for the profession.
Another recommendation was that NPs contribute
to maintenance of standards by participation in pro-
fessional and registration/regulation bodies through
provision of advice, taking on a membership role in
standards committees, tribunals, and panels. It was
also suggested that NPs participate in community
forums and awareness relating to health issues.
. In addition to the level being sufficient to meet the NP
Standard of Practice envisaged by respondents from
health departments, other feedback suggested that the
definition of APN as a legislated/protected title for
NPs was problematic because nurses with advanced
nursing could also be leading clinical teams and
should not be excluded from the title of APN, even
though their position titles are not regulated, and their
practice is within the RN scope. Comments reflected a
conflation of ANP in the RN scope, demonstrated in
RN positions such as Clinical Nurse Consultant and
its relationship to the NP. Feedback was inconsistent
and sometimes appeared confused in understanding
of definitions of advanced practice. The issue of the
use of standards in assessing suitability for endorse-
ment and the need for clarity in the standards and
accompanying definitions were articulated. Several
participants highlighted the lack of clarity regarding
ANP and confusion with APN making endorsement
process a nightmare and open to subjective interpret-
ation. The internal consultation identified two key
issues: some debate about perception of the standards
as setting a minimum rather than maximum level; and
the operational definition of advanced practice, which
remained contentious and in need of clarification.
Following the Australian Health Practitioners
Regulation Agency preliminary consultation, the draft
standards were made available for broader stakeholder/
public feedback. Although 152 separate responses were
received, the number of responses varied for different
statements and cues. The average number of responses
per Statement was 42. Responses were primarily related
to individual wording as opposed to the need for
conceptual revision. While some respondents proposed
more nuanced language, others requested further simpli-
fication of language.
Phase 3: Validation of the Revised Standards
The third and final phase was observation of NPs at
work. This phase was conducted through the lens of sci-
entific and technical analysis (Head, 2008). It involved a
stratified sample of 35 NPs from diverse locales in
Australia. This was the first Australian study to use a
representative stratified sample of NPs. NP practice was
compared with the fourth draft version of the standards
to validate the standards' content. It also informed the
fifth and final version of the standards.
The three major criteria for NP selection in this phase
were as follows: (a) their location in a state or territory
based on proportionate representation of NPs in all
states and territories; (b) whether they worked in an
urban, regional, or remote location based on the
Measuring Remoteness: Accessibility/Remoteness Index
of Australia (ARIA; Commonwealth Department of
Health and Aged Care, 2001) classification of their post-
code; and (c) their practice specialty (b and c determined
proportionately; see Tables 1 to 3). Observers were either
members of the research team or NPs trained to use
the observation instrument. Each NP was observed
undertaking a routine day of practice. Observers noted
behaviors in a structured observation tool based on the
draft standards. Three types of observation evidence
were sought for each standard. They were as follows:
(a) observations of behavior, (b) the NP speaking
openly about a process that was not visible to the obser-
ver (modus operandi thinking), and (c) artifacts or
documented evidence, including teaching appointments,
published journal articles, and research projects.
The following are the key findings from the observa-
tions: (a) all standards were visible in 97% of NPs observed;
(b) 86% of the standard cues were observed or evidenced in
more than 80% of participants; (c) a high variance in levels
of NP practice from novice to experienced existed,

especially in the domains of leadership, education, and
research. The validation observations confirmed that NPs
work across many different contexts of practice and sys-
tems requiring high levels of systems literacy.
The validation of the standards through observations
of the NPs at work was both informative and inspir-
ational. Although the validation phase was technically
challenging to organize, it enabled the research team to
observe the diversity and sophistication of practice and
the impact of NP services in a rich variety of contexts
across Australia. It provided important evidence that
enabled the team to conclude that the revised standards
reflected NP practice in Australia and provided a basis
for future adaptation to specialty-specific standards.
Following completion of Phase 3, the penultimate ver-
sion of the standards was submitted to the NMBA for
review. The final standards as approved by the NMBA
were made public in September 2013 (NMBA, 2013) and
came into effect after January 1, 2014.
Discussion and Conclusion
The research and policy development process that we
used allowed an iterative building of new draft NP
standards for Australia. Once we developed the draft
standards far enough, we were able to conduct work--
based observations. Stakeholder perspectives, especially
the importance of definitional clarification, were two
major issues that arose through the iterative process.
Tension between the needs of different stakeholders in
terms of the technical detail of the standards also
emerged. The needs of consumers and carers differed
from those of NPs, themselves, faculty designing univer-
sity courses, and AHPRA staff assessing applicants for
endorsement. Another theme that the initial phases of
the project generated was that the standards need to
depict NP attributes as clinically focussed, reflecting
what an NP can do. The pillars from the Strong Model
(Ackerman, Norsen, Martin, Wiedrich, & Kitzman,
1996) of leadership, education, research, and practice
are expressed in relation to NP clinical practice (see
Figure 2).
Another important finding was that before standards
could operate effectively, they needed to include defin-
itional clarity across ANP (as opposed to APN). This is
essential to allow recognition of advanced practice
within the RN scope for NP candidates applying for
endorsement by the NMBA as an NP. Further, it was
evident that the term NP needed to be clearly defined
and separated from the colloquial term of practice
nurse. This was addressed in the glossary of the stand-
ards (see Table 4).
Definitional clarity allows consumers and policy
makers to situate NPs among the other multitude of
nursing titles that have proliferated internationally
(Pulcini et al., 2010). This is a first step, matching nursing
providers with work to be done, or service sought. For
policy makers, this is particularly important in Australia
with its move to scenario-based modeling of the health
workforce (McCarty & Fenech, 2012). Scenario-based
modeling refers to the process of exploring possible
futures in health workforce through modeling based on

Figure 2. Framework for the Nurse Practitioner Standards of Practice Australia.
Table 4. Glossary Developed for Standards as Published in the Standards.
Advanced nursing practice (ANP): ANP is a continuum along which nurses develop their professional knowledge, clinical reasoning
and judgment, skills and behaviors to higher levels of capability (that is recognizable). Nurses practicing at an advanced level incorporate
professional leadership, education, and research into their clinically based practice. Their practice is effective and safe. They work within a
generalist or specialist context, and they are responsible and accountable for managing people who have complex healthcare requirements.
ANP is a level of practice and not a role. It is acknowledged that ANP is individually attributed within a regulated nursing scope (enrolled
nurse, registered nurse, or nurse practitioner).
Advanced practice nursing (APN): APN in the Australian nursing context identifies the additional legislative functions of an endorsed
nurse practitioner that are outside the contemporary registered nurse scope of practice. Advanced practice nursing as a nurse practitioner
is a qualitatively different level of ANP from that of the registered nurse due to the additional legislative functions and the regulatory
requirements. The requirements include a prescribed educational level, a specified ANP experience, and continuing professional devel-
opment.
(Advanced practice nursing should not be confused with the term practice nurse that is used colloquially to describe nurses working in the
general practice setting.)
Attributes: Attributes are characteristics that underpin competent performance. http://www.anmac.org.au/userfiles/file/competency_

Competence: The combination of skills, knowledge, attitudes, values, and abilities that underpin effective and superior performance in a
profession/occupational area.http://www.anmac.org.au/userfiles/file/competency_standards/Competency_standards_RN.pdf
Cues: Key generic examples of competent performance. They are neither comprehensive nor exhaustive. They assist the assessor when
using their professional judgment in assessing nursing practice. They further assist curriculum development. http://www.anmac.org.au/

Nurse Practitioner: A nurse practitioner is an advanced practice nurse endorsed by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia to
practice within their scope under the legislatively protected title "nurse practitioner."
Person/people: In these Standards, person/people is used to refer to those individuals who have entered into a relationship with a nurse
practitioner. Person/people encompass patients, clients, consumers, and families that fall within the nurse practitioner scope and context of
practice.
Prescribing: Prescribing is defined as the steps of information gathering, clinical decision making, communication, and evaluation which
results in the initiation, continuation, or cessation of a medicine.
Scope of practice: The scope of nursing practice is that in which nurses are educated, competent to perform, and permitted by law. The
actual scope of practice of individual practitioners is influenced by the settings in which they practice, the health needs of people, the level
of competence and confidence of the nurse, and the policy requirements of the service provider.

what types of workers are capable to perform specific
roles required in healthcare delivery. For consumers,
this is important when deciding whom to consult for a
health issue.
Evidence also highlighted the need to formally recog-
nize that newly endorsed NPs may practice as novices
and that it is necessary to set standards of required
minimum attributes that build upon the foundational
RN standards. Importantly, findings from this study
confirmed that instead of NPs becoming increasingly
specialized--more than other advanced and specialist
practice roles within the RN scope--they actually
become more generalist, building a broader base of prac-
tice as required to safely exercise the extended privileges
embedded within the NP scope. This finding is important
as advanced within nursing has been applied as a direc-
tional metaphor. Directional metaphors are one of the
foundational metaphors in Western thought (Lakoff &
Johnson, 1980). The Western view of progress is condi-
tioned by advancement, as the steady movement forward
in the same direction in the name of progress (Donovan,
1997). Yet, interestingly, our study shows that NP devel-
opment and APN might require a reversal of direction.
NP development moves toward optimizing the specialist
practice, formed in ANP with the RN scope. This pro-
cess involves building a broader generalist base on which
to situate the specialist practice. So in effect rather than
moving further in the same direction of specialization,
the NP becomes more generalist. This finding highlights
the pragmatic element of distinguishing between ANP
and APN. The project team developed clear definitions
of each term, and they were endorsed as part of the
standard by the NMBA (see Table 4).
The project team also expected that there would be
some duplication between standards for APN and RNs
because NPs are fundamentally nurses who have the
ability to fully utilize the RN scope and practice as
NPs. Our findings suggested that although this might
be obvious to some nurses, the new standards needed
to clearly state that NP practice is nursing practice.
This was principally motivated by the political concern
of making sure NPs remained philosophically immersed
within nursing and did not drift to the ideological pos-
ition of medicine, becoming mini-doctors.
The context and process used to formulate the policy
tool of the Australian NP Standards for Practice,
launched in September 2013 (NMBA, 2013), provides
direction for future evaluation of NP utilization. The
policy represents an internationally novel, clinical inter-
pretation of the pillar-based approach (Ackerman et al.,
1996) to standards and provides definitional clarity to
stakeholders. Evidence of policy success or failure is
rarely clear-cut. Rigorous analysis more commonly
shows that policy performs in the gray area in between
absolute success and failure, with relative success in some
of the bundle of outcomes (McConnell, 2010). Hence, it
remains to be seen how future analyses of these policy
changes will deem its success in achieving objectives
across the multiple uses of the standards.
Project Limitations
Limitations to this project are as follows: Stakeholder
diversity, single-day observations of a complex and vari-
able role, and the need to balance subjective opinion
from a diverse range of stakeholders all of which posed
challenges in the analysis. However, viewed in the con-
text of policy formation, all three lenses of political
knowledge, scientific research-based knowledge, and
field experience have been consciously included
(Head, 2008). As the distinction between policy and
politics is not clear-cut, and in some languages not
distinguished at all, this research limitation can be
viewed as policy strength (Buse, Mays, & Walt,
2005). Consultative processes including focus groups
are limited by the fact that participants are often
unable to move outside their own personal or profes-
sional sphere of thinking (Yen et al., 2011). This limi-
tation can bias findings toward support of the status
quo. In focus groups, this effect can be compounded,
as there can be a drive to normative discourses biased
by more dominant members, even when the groups are
carefully moderated (Smithson, 2000).
Conclusion
In clarifying constructs throughout the study, we strived
to keep clear audit trails to demonstrate validity and
rigor and hold to a clear process. Thus, we can defend
the mixed-methods design and the plural, cultural, and
practical nature of the knowledge claims. The Australian
NP Standards for Practice, while shaped by the
Australian-specific context and actors, provide novel
application of the pillar approach to standards. We
hope that NPs in other countries might find this article
useful in revising their NP standards and offer sugges-
tions as to how the research and policy process might be
improved. We also provide insight and advancement the
definitional conundrum around advanced practice that
concerns nursing and NPs, globally.
