Utilizing data from the 1991 Health and Retirement Study Early Release File, this article
examines the effects of disability status on labor force participation and earnings of
preretirement workers aged 50 to 64. Results from our hierarchical regression models suggest
that poor health and the presence of a work disability significantly reduced the labor force
participation and earnings of older men and women. These analyses also suggest that
economic well-being was constrained by the costs associated with additional "minority
statuses." For example, the odds of being employed were reduced by approximately 46% for
black men with disabilities. Further, the earnings of black men were 17% lower than the
earnings of their nondisabled counterparts.

Disentangling the Effects of Disability Status
and Gender on the Labor Supply of Anglo,
Black, and Latino Older Workers1
Anna M. Santiago, PhD2 and Clara G. Muschkin, PhD
During the 1980s, the working-age population with
severe disabilities increased by 158% in the United
States (Dejong, Batavia, & Griss, 1989). By 1990, ap-
proximately 43 million persons in the United States
reported some type of disability that limited their
ability to work. In addition to being older, the dis-
abled population was disproportionately female. Fif-
teen percent of the disabled were black, and slightly
less than 10% were Latino (Kirkpatrick, 1994). In-
creased survival rates for persons with chronic dis-
eases, increased awareness of health problems, in-
creases in work-related accidents and illnesses, and
the changing demographic structure of the working-
age population have been identified as factors asso-
ciated with this growth (Wolfe & Haveman, 1990).
However, one of the most important factors cited for
this growth is the increase in the size and proportion
of the population at older ages, when disability rates
are highest. Midlife and older workers have become
a larger part of the labor force, with growth rates as
well as participation rates of the 55+ population
increasing significantly during the 1990s (U.S. Senate
Special Committee on Aging, 1991). Although Anglo
(see Appendix B, Note 1) males still represent the

majority of the older working-age population, the
proportions of women and ethnic minorities have
grown steadily. Currently, the aged segment of eth-
nic groups has been growing at a faster rate than the
older Anglo population, with Latinos the fastest
growing ethnic group (Wykle & Kaskel, 1991). This
trend is projected to continue into the next century
(Barresi&Stull,1993).
The growth of the population of female and minor-
ity older workers has important implications for the
composition of the work-disabled population, as
both groups report higher rates of disability than
Anglo men. Research on women with disabilities has
revealed that women have higher rates of chronic
illness and severe disability and higher rates of multi-
ple disabling conditions. At the older working ages
(45-64 years), women are more likely than men to
report a limitation that makes them unable to work
(Verbrugge, 1989). With regard to differences by
race, there is consistent evidence that blacks have
poorer health than Anglos, based on mortality rates,
functional health, and self-reported health indica-
tors. Older blacks are almost twice as likely as older
Anglos to suffer from the major chronic illnesses,
and mortality rates for the major illnesses also are
highest for older and middle-aged blacks (Barresi &
Stull, 1993; Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waidmann,
1994; Chatters, 1993). Blacks at middle and older ages
are more likely than Anglos to experience disability
generally and to experience restriction in a major
activity, including work (Bound etal., 1994; Chatters,
1993; Manuel, 1988).
Findings on the health and functional status of
older Latinos have been less consistent, in part be-
cause of the paucity of information available for
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 299
national comparisons across racial and ethnic
groups. Although Latinos have some important
health disadvantages relative to the majority popula-
tion when compared across all ages, it appears that
older Latinos have better outcomes than Anglos in
terms of death rates and prevalence of severe
chronic diseases (Espino, 1993). In contrast to the
death and disease patterns, disability indicators are
worse for older Latinos than for non-Hispanic
whites, but better than for blacks. Older Puerto Ri-
cans are the exception, reporting the highest disabil-
ity rates of all groups (O'Donnell, 1989). As com-
pared with Anglos, older persons of Mexican origin
report fewer disabilities under age 45 years, but more
disability and restricted activity days at age 45 and
older, with the ethnicity gap widening with age
(Markides, Coreil, & Rogers, 1989; Wallace, Camp-
bell, & Lew-Ting, 1994). Gender differences in health
and the prevalence of disability persist within race
and national origin groups. Latina women are more
likely than Latino men to suffer multiple illnesses,
and they have higher incidence rates of some
chronic conditions (Espino, 1993; Wykle & Kaskel,
1994). Among blacks, women of middle and older
ages are more likely than men to report a disabling
condition (Jackson & Perry, 1989).
How do the consequences of disability status vary
by gender, race, and ethnicity? The economic conse-
quences of disability have been studied extensively
for Anglo men. Men with disabilities are less likely to
be employed and have lower earnings than nondis-
abled men (Baldwin & Johnson, 1994; Berkowitz &
Hill, 1989; Bound & Waidmann, 1992; Burkhauser &
Haveman, 1982; Yelin, 1992). Much less attention has
been given to examining these costs for women and
minorities. The limited empirical literature to date
suggests that women and minorities with disabilities
are uniquely disadvantaged in the labor market by
virtue of their multiple minority status (Deegan,
1985; see Appendix B, Note 2). However, as Kilpa-
trick (1994) noted, although it is assumed that the
combined impact of race or ethnic status, gender,
and disability has a deleterious effect on the eco-
nomic well-being of women and minorities, these
issues have received scant attention in the disability
literature. The prevalence patterns of poor health
and disability noted earlier further underscore the
need to evaluate their economic impact, particularly
given the fact that disabilities are the primary health
disadvantage of older Latinos, and involve an appar-
ent double jeopardy situation for minority women.
Across all ages, female earnings are strongly af-
fected by poor health (Lonsdale, 1990; Loprest, Rup-
pert, & Sandell, 1993; Mudrick 1983). Research
among the older working-age population (ages 45 to
64 years) indicates that women with health-related
job limitations are more likely to leave the labor force
than men with similar conditions (Verbrugge, 1989).
Because few women are eligible for wage-related
benefit programs when they become disabled, they
are highly dependent on income from means-tested
transfer programs (Loprest et al., 1993; U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1989). Single parenthood, marital dis-
solution, and the presence of a disabled spouse or
dependent have been identified as factors associated
with the worsening health of women (see Deegan &
Brooks, 1985; Lonsdale, 1990; Mudrick, 1983).
Research suggests similar patterns of disadvantage
for blacks with disabilities. Luft (1978) found that
blacks were more likely to leave the labor force, work
fewer hours, or move into different jobs because of
work limitations, as compared with Anglos. Recent
studies (Burkhauser, Haveman, & Wolfe, 1993; Yelin,
1992) suggest that the deterioration of earnings dur-
ing the 1970s and 1980s was particularly severe for
black men with disabilities. Among the older
working-age population, a substantial fraction of the
racial gap in labor force participation may be attrib-
uted to health limitations on the capacity to work
(Bound et al., 1994). Increasing disability among
middle-aged and older blacks has been associated
with shifting retirement statuses, whereby the disabil-
ity role is adopted by persons who are not working in
full-time jobs but do not consider themselves retired.
Sporadic work patterns over the life course, low lev-
els of retirement benefits, the need to continue work-
ing at older ages, and increases in physical disability
contribute to growth of an "unretired retired" seg-
ment of the black population. This group is the most
overall deprived of the black elderly population, and
often is ignored in the retirement research that
shapes policy and planning (Gibson, 1988).
Research on the consequences of work disabilities
for Latinos is more limited, despite the growth of the
disabled Latino population. Existing studies suggest
that only one out of ten Latinos with work impair-
ments was employed full time in the labor force (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1989). For those who were
working full time, Latinos earned approximately 73%
of the earnings of Anglos with disabilities. In an early
study, Bowe (1985) reported that nearly 60% of Lati-
nos with disabilities had earnings below $4,000. Fur-
ther, the chances of being unemployed were quite
high for Latinos (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1989).
Nearly two out of ten Latina women and three out of
ten Latino men were unemployed in 1988. Angel
(1984) found that Latino men with disabilities suf-
fered greater loss of work and income than their
non-Latino counterparts. He also noted significant
differences in the impact of disability status within
the Latino population, comparing Mexican, Puerto
Rican, and Cuban men. Puerto Ricans were found to
be particularly disadvantaged relative to all other
groups, sustaining higher losses in earnings and
work hours.
In a recent study using data from the 1990 Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, Santiago (1994) analyzed
race, ethnic, and gender differences in the costs of
disability status among working-aged adults (ages
18-64 years). The results of her analyses are consist-
ent with patterns documented in the literature, re-
vealing that disability greatly reduced labor force
participation across all groups. Further, when per-
sons were employed, disability also reduced returns
to work. When employed, black and Latino men with
disabilities worked fewer hours and had lower earn-
300 The Gerontologist
ings than either Anglo men with disabilities or non-
disabled minorities. For women, the patterns of dis-
advantage were similar to those of men but more
pronounced. Disabled women were less likely to
work than nondisabled women or disabled men.
When compared to Anglos, blacks, and other Latino
subgroups, Puerto Rican men and women were
found to be uniquely disadvantaged. This study sug-
gests that the economic well-being of blacks and
Latinos is constrained by the costs associated with
carrying "multiple minority" statuses, lending partial
support to the multiple minority status hypothesis
suggested by Kirkpatrick (1994) and others.
The present analysis extends the work on varia-
tions in the consequences of disability status by
focusing on the labor supply of Anglo, black, and
Latino older workers, and by disaggregating Latinos
into major national origin groups. Our first task was
to examine the patterns of work disability by gender
and ethnicity, using alternative measures uniquely
available for all of these groups in the nationally
representative sample of older adults contained in
the 1992 Health and Retirement Study (see Appen-
dix B, Note 3). A second phase of our analysis in-
volved a detailed examination of the variations in
labor force participation across the comparison
groups and evaluation of race, gender, and ethnic/
national origin variations in the impact of disability
on labor supply. In multivariate analyses, we exam-
ined the various effects of work limitations and over-
all health status, minority status, and socioeconomic
resources on the labor supply of older Anglo, black,
and Latino men and women. A final dimension of the
analysis involved testing the effect of multiple minor-
ity statuses, to evaluate the additional costs of dis-
ability for persons who face double or triple jeopardy
because of their ascribed membership within other
minority groups (i.e., being female, black or Latino).
Methods
Data and Sample
This study uses data from the first wave of the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS; see Appendix
B, Note 4), a national longitudinal study that focuses
on the preretirement-age population, namely, per-
sons born between 1931 and 1941. With its focus on
older workers, the HRS provides unique opportuni-
ties to examine the relationship of disability to labor
supply. Although there is considerable consensus in
the literature regarding the relevance of health, func-
tional limitations, family characteristics, resources,
and demographic attributes in shaping the labor
force participation of persons with disabilities
(Bound, 1989; Bound & Waidmann, 1992; Bound et
al., 1994; Yelin, 1992), much of this research has been
restricted by data sets that captured only subsets of
the information necessary to disentangle the effects
of these factors on labor supply. Also, previous stud-
ies generally have lacked sufficiently large subsam-
ples of minority respondents to reliably compare
differences across groups. The HRS overcomes these
difficulties by providing detailed information on fac-
tors that influence labor force participation decisions
by persons with disabilities, including numerous
health-related measures and measures of program
participation. In addition, the HRS provides in-depth
information on respondent demographic and em-
ployment characteristics before and after the onset
of a disability. Moreover, the HRS oversamples
Mexican-Americans, blacks, and households in the
state of Florida, thus providing the basis for detailed
analyses of the interrelationships between race, La-
tino origin, disability, gender, and labor supply.
The first wave of the HRS successfully interviewed
12,654 respondents, of which 53.6% are women. The
sample also includes 2,064 blacks, 706 Mexican-
Americans, 99 Puerto Ricans, and 369 other Latinos
(including Cubans). The oversampling of minority
groups means that analyses must incorporate com-
pensatory weighting for selection probabilities and
must adjust for geographic and group differences in
response rates. Total sample weights and race/
gender-specific weighting factors were used in the
descriptive and multivariate analyses in this study.
Our working sample was restricted to respondents
and their spouses/partners who were between the
ages of 50 and 64 years, the segment of the target
preretirement population that would be expected to
participate in the labor force. To facilitate race/ethnic
group comparisons, we excluded persons who were
not Anglo (non-Latino white), black, or Latino. The
sample was also restricted to those respondents who
had information about disability status. Thus, we
were left with a total sample of 10,350 persons, in-
cluding 7,631 Anglos, 1,762 blacks, and 957 Latinos.
Our multivariate analyses of employment status
were estimated on a sample that was restricted by
labor force status. We included in these models
individuals who were in the labor force -- working,
unemployed, looking for work, on leave, or dis-
abled. People permanently out of the labor force
were excluded. This group included homemakers,
individuals who had never worked, and respondents
who defined themselves as retired. This yielded a
sample of 8,076 individuals, including 4,458 men
(3,374 Anglos, 666 blacks, and 418 Latinos) and 3,618
women (2,529 Anglos, 788 blacks, and 301 Latinas).
For the earnings equations, the sample was even
further restricted to those persons who had reported
working for pay at least one hour and who had
positive earnings in 1990. The resulting sample sizes
were 3,219 (total), 1,796 men (including 1,375 Anglos,
257 blacks, and 164 Latinos) and 1,419 women (in-
cluding 959 Anglos, 355 blacks, and 105 Latinas).
Model Specification
In this study, we hypothesized that the labor sup-
ply and earnings of older workers are influenced by
four sets of factors: the health and disability status of
the individual, the existence of additional minority
statuses, the socioeconomic resources of the indi-
vidual, and the demographic characteristics of the
individual. The overall health status of the individual
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 301
is expected to shape perceptions about the ability to
work. Disability status is expected to restrict the type
or amount of work that can be performed. The pres-
ence of additional minority statuses is expected to
add to the costs of a disabling condition. Differences
in human capital that affect labor force participation
and earnings are also examined. Finally, we control
for differences in population attributes. To account
for the differences in the probability of selection into
the sample, all variables were weighted using the
individual sample weights.
Two outcome measures were used: employment
status at the time of the survey and annual wages.
Employment status is a dichotomy, indicating
whether the respondent worked for pay at the time
of the survey. The models for this outcome were
estimated with weighted logistic regression. The
earnings measure was conditioned on labor force
participation. For persons reporting positive earn-
ings and work hours, annual wages refer to the
natural logarithm of the respondent's wage earnings
during 1991. The earnings equations were estimated
using a weighted least squares (WLS) regression
technique.
Predictor Measures
Individual Health and Disability Status. -- Health
status is represented by three separate measures in
our models in order to address previously reported
concerns regarding race/ethnic variation in self-
reported health status (Barresi & Stull, 1993;
Markides et al., 1989; Wallace et al., 1994). These
include a self-reported physical health rating, as well
as a self-rating of emotional health and an indicator
of whether the respondent's health status worsened
in 1991. Each of these measures was derived from a
Likert-scaled item in the HRS questionnaire. The
three variables in the models are defined as dichoto-
mies, referencing the presence of poor or fair health
status. Studies of the impact of health on work out-
comes suggest that low health status not only is
associated with early withdrawal from the labor
force, but also contributes to reduced work hours
and earnings by lowering worker productivity
(Berkowitz & Hill, 1989; Bound et al., 1994; Wolfe &
Haveman, 1990). Thus, we expect that persons re-
porting fair or poor health are less likely to be em-
ployed and more likely to have lower earnings than
persons in good or excellent health.
Disability status is measured in these models as a
dichotomous state, referencing whether the respon-
dent is currently experiencing an impairment or
health problem that limits the kind or amount of paid
work that he or she can do. In the analyses presented
here, we define work disability using the self-
reported item indicating the presence of a work
limitation. This measure of disability status is present
for all persons in our analysis sample -- persons who
are in the labor force. For all persons in our sample,
we expect that the presence of a work disability will
have negative consequences on the likelihood of
employment. Furthermore, among persons who are
currently working, a work disability implies lower
returns for their labor in terms of annual wages.
Additional Minority Statuses. -- Minority status
measures are used both to stratify the sample for
group-specific analyses, and as predictor variables in
the models for the entire sample and in the gender-
specific models. The more inclusive models contain
dichotomous indicators of black, Mexican, Puerto
Rican, and other Latino status, in order to evaluate
variations in the impact of minority status on labor
supply and wage outcomes. In addition, the multipli-
cative effects of minority status are represented with
a series of interaction terms in the final models, thus
measuring the conditional effects of being female,
black, or Latino for persons who are disabled. We
hypothesize that there is an additional negative cost
in terms of participation and earnings if the presence
of a work disability is coupled with being female,
black, Mexican, Puerto Rican or other Latino.
Economic Resources. -- The equations include
several additional predictors of work outcomes (eco-
nomic resources) that are relevant primarily for Lati-
nos, including immigration status, the number of
years that the person has resided in the United
States, and having limited English language profi-
ciency. Immigration status is defined by whether the
respondent was born outside or inside the United
States. For immigrants, years in the United States are
computed from information on the year of arrival.
The measure of limited English proficiency is a di-
chotomous indicator of Spanish language domi-
nance. Based on the considerable literature on work
outcomes among Latinos in the United States, we
expect that immigrant status is associated with some
disadvantages in terms of employment and income.
Latino immigrants who have lived in the United
States longer, and thus have had the opportunity to
acquire U.S.-specific work experience, are expected
to work more and have higher earnings than more
recent immigrants. Limited English proficiency is an
indicator of a lack of attachment to the local labor
market, and thus is associated with lower probabili-
ties of employment and lower returns to work. An-
other measure of resources that influence work out-
comes is educational attainment, available for
respondents of all racial and ethnic groups. This
variable is a continuous measure of years of com-
pleted education. It is hypothesized that more years
of education are positively associated with being
employed and receiving higher wages.
Demographic Characteristics. -- Age and marital
status are included in the models as demographic
factors that must be controlled in order to account
for distributional differences among groups. How-
ever, both factors also may be considered resources
that influence labor market outcomes. Age often is
considered a proxy measure of work experience,
which is positively associated with labor force partici-
pation and higher wage levels. However, at older
working ages, aging brings persons closer to the time
302 The Gerontologist
of full or partial retirement from the labor force, and
often it is associated with the onset of health prob-
lems that influence both labor force participation
and wage levels. Being married generally is associ-
ated with higher labor supply elasticities among
women and lower elasticities for men (Loprest et al.,
1993). Thus, at older ages married men are expected
to be more likely to stay in the labor force than their
unmarried counterparts, whereas the opposite rela-
tionship is hypothesized for women.
Four models are estimated for each of the outcome
variables. Model 1 focuses on the effects of disability
status on the probability of employment, work
hours, hourly earnings, and wages, in the presence
of controls for health status, age, sex, and marital
status. Model 2 introduces the minority status vari-
ables. In Model 3, the resource variables are in-
cluded to control for differences in education, immi-
gration status, work experience in the United States,
and English language proficiency. Interaction terms
are included in Model 4 to examine the combined
effects of disability and minority status on labor sup-
ply and wage outcomes. The models are estimated
hierarchically, which permits an evaluation of
changes in coefficients, particularly the impact of
disability, when additional sets of influencing factors
are controlled. The full set of models is estimated for
the entire sample, with gender included in the model
as a minority status predictor, and for separate analy-
ses of men and women. We also estimated reduced-
form equations for ethnic and gender subgroups.
However, in this article, we present the findings for
the full sample only (see Appendix B, Note 5).
Results
Measuring Disability Status Among Older Workers
Prior studies have noted important methodologi-
cal implications using only subjective or self-
reported measures. The propensity to report a dis-
ability has been found to vary by gender (Loprest et
al., 1993), race, and ethnicity (Angel, 1984; Bound
etal., 1994; Gibson, 1988; Santiago, 1994; Wallace et
al., 1994), and income (Yelin, 1992). Problems also
arise when the disability measure is conditional on
work activities, as the differences in the extent and
impact of disability may reflect existing gender, race,
and ethnic differences in conditions of employment
(Haveman & Wolfe, 1985). Furthermore, there is evi-
dence that disability status, in terms of self-reported
work limitations, may in turn be influenced by labor
force status, such as retirement (see Appendix B,
Note 6).
In response to these concerns, the HRS contains
multiple objective and self-reported measures of
health status and disability. Appendix A describes 19
measures derived from HRS data depicting func-
tional status, overall physical and mental health, and
participation in government programs for the dis-
abled. Eleven of the measures are primary respon-
dent self-reports of the health status of eligible adults
in the household. There are eight objective indica-
tors of disability, including four that measure partici-
pation in programs for the disabled. Table 1 presents
summary information regarding the prevalence of
disability across racial, ethnic, and gender lines.
Results are weighted in order to provide national
estimates for each of the different subpopulations.
As shown in Table 1, the prevalence of disability
varied significantly by race and Latino origin. The
results underscore the precarious health status of
minority men and women. Among men, approxi-
mately 19% of blacks and 17% of Latinos reported
being disabled in 1991. Among women, the propor-
tion disabled was 17% for blacks and 11% for Latinas.
When self-reported work disability measures were
used, we found that approximately 25% of blacks and
Latinos, regardless of gender, reported a work limita-
tion, and the majority indicated that the condition
was permanent.
When disability status was measured using general
reports of physical and emotional health, a substan-
tially higher proportion of blacks and Latinos consid-
ered themselves to be in fair or poor health relative
to Anglos. Although 17% of Anglo men reported fair
or poor physical health, approximately 34% of black
men and 32% of Latino men indicated low health
status. Among women, 37% of blacks and 44% of
Latinas reported that they were in fair to poor health
-- a rate two to three times higher than that for Anglo
women. Minority men and women, particularly Lati-
nos, were also more likely to report a worsening of
their health status. One out of five Latinas and one
out of six Latinos reported that their health had
declined in the year prior to the survey.
When more objective measures of health status
are used, we see that, in general, women have higher
rates of mobility impairments, chronic illness, and
ADL difficulties. In contrast, men tend to report
slightly higher rates of sensory impairments. How-
ever, when we look across different groups of
women, we see that black women had the highest
prevalence rates for chronic illness and ADL impair-
ments. Latinas had the highest rates of mobility
impairments.
If disability is described in terms of program partic-
ipation, several patterns emerge. First, reported
rates of disability are significantly lower: prevalence
rates are generally less than half of the self-reported
rates. Because participation in these programs is
based on meeting a series of eligibility requirements,
only one of which is the presence of a disabling
condition, the lower prevalence of disability may
simply mean that persons with disabilities have a
more difficult time in meeting program require-
ments. Second, men are more likely to receive dis-
ability benefits from Social Security, the Veteran's
Administration, and Workers' Compensation, which
is probably an artifact of the lower participation of
women in the military and the more unstable work
histories of women (see Appendix B, Note 7). Third,
minorities generally have higher rates of program
participation, particularly in public welfare disability
programs. Again, this may reflect difficulties in meet-
ing eligibility requirements.

As we have shown, there is considerable range of
response to the HRS questions on disability status.
For our analyses of the economic consequences of
disability status, we had to decide which of the mea-
sures to use. Although we heeded the aforemen-
tioned concerns related to self-reports of health sta-
tus expressed by Haveman and Wolfe (1985), we
decided to use self-reports of overall health status
and work limitations as predictors in our multivariate
models predicting labor force participation and earn-
ings (see Appendix B, Note 8). There were three
primary concerns that shaped our decision. The first
was the concern that program participation mea-
sures would underestimate the extent of disability
among women and minority men. A second concern
reflected our interest in comparing the results of this
study with previous research. The HRS question re-
garding the self-report of a work limitation closely
parallels questions found in the Census, the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), and other na-
tional surveys. Finally, we were concerned about
tapping into the effects of the cognitive dimension of
disability. If individuals perceive themselves to be in
poor health or unable to work, these perceptions
may be the primary factors underlying labor market
behaviors.
Characteristics of the Older Working Age Population
by Disability Status, Ethnicity, and Gender
Table 2 documents the effects of disability status of
older men and women. For comparative purposes,
results are presented for Anglos, blacks, and Latinos.
Again, weighted results are presented so we can
generalize to the national population. For all groups,
persons with disabilities tended to be older than
their nondisabled counterparts. They also had sig-
nificantly lower levels of schooling, on average, one
to two years lower than persons without disabilities.
Latino men and women with disabilities had the
lowest levels of schooling -- approximately eight
years. Although Anglos and blacks tend to be over-
whelmingly native-born, approximately one-half of
older Latinos were immigrants. Latinos with disabili-
ties were more likely to be Spanish dominant and to
have resided in the United States longer than their
nondisabled counterparts.
For all groups, disability greatly reduced labor
force participation and the return to work. Labor
force participation rates were approximately 50 to
75% lower for persons with disabilities than their
nondisabled counterparts. Among disabled men,
Anglos reported the highest labor force participation
(42%) while blacks were the least likely to be em-
ployed (21%). Only about 26% of Latino men with
disabilities were employed. This is in sharp contrast
to the high rates (>80%) of labor force participation
of nondisabled minority men.
When employed, black and Latino men with dis-
abilities had lower earnings than Anglo men with
disabilities as well as their nondisabled counterparts.
Anglo men with disabilities had mean annual earnings
of $25,865. In contrast, black men with disabilities
earned approximately $1,000 less than disabled Anglo
men, suggesting a higher degree of employment se-
lectivity among blacks. Of interest, Latinos with dis-
abilities earned $16,948, despite working more hours
than blacks. Although disability status significantly

reduced the earnings of all men with disabilities,
disabled Anglo men had earnings that, on average,
were 62% of the earnings of nondisabled Anglos.
Also, disabled Anglo men were in a position of advan-
tage relative to minority men. The annual earnings of
disabled Anglos were higher than those for nondis-
abled Latinos, and although lower than nondisabled
blacks, they were not significantly different.
For disabled men out of the labor force, govern-
ment sponsored income support and social insur-
ance programs were significant sources of income.
More than half of the disabled Anglo, black, and
Latino men were receiving benefits from the Social
Security Disability Insurance or SSI program. Latino
men with disabilities had the highest rates of partici-
pation in Social Securty/SSI disability programs
(58%). In addition, Latinos had the highest participa-
tion in the Workers' Compensation program (14%)
and public welfare disability programs (11%). Anglo
men had the highest participation rate for the Vet-
erans Administration disability program (11%).
The patterns of disadvantage noted here are even
more pronounced for women with disabilities. Not
only are women less likely to work than their nondis-
abled counterparts, they are also less likely to work
than disabled men. Further, they are also likely to
receive lower returns for their labor. Anglo women
with disabilities earn, on average, $13,914, approxi-
mately 69% of the wages of nondisabled Anglos.
Black and Latina women with disabilities earn, on
average, approximately 55% of the earnings of non-
disabled minority women ($10,424 and $7,631, re-
spectively). Further, black women with disabilities
earn only 75% of what Anglo women with disabilities
earn; Latinas with disabilities earn only 55%. In addi-
tion, although only 30% of Anglo women with dis-
abilities are in the labor force, and they worked, on
average, 405 hours in 1990, their participation rates
are approximately twice as high as those for minority
women with disabilities. Employed Latinas were
more likely to be working in the low-wage sector of
the labor market.
The economic well-being of women with disabili-
ties was directly linked to the receipt of income
transfers from Social Security/SSI, Workers' Com-
pensation, or public welfare disability programs and
reflected their economic vulnerability. Approxi-
mately 50% of Anglo and Latina women and 56% of
black women received Social Security disability ben-
efits, more likely than not from the SSI program. In
addition, nearly 9% of Anglo women, 3% of black
women, and 7% of Latinas received Workers' Com-
pensation. Finally, 11% of Latinas, 7% of blacks, and
nearly 5% of Anglos received disability benefits from
public welfare programs. The higher rates of partici-
pation in these programs suggest an additional layer
of economic insecurity because these programs tend
to have lower benefit levels and require re-
establishing program eligibility (Mudrick, 1983).
Predicting the Employment Status of Older Workers
The logistic regression results for the models pre-
dicting the probability of being employed in 1991 are
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 305
presented in Table 3. In all of the following discus-
sion, the results are described using the antilogs of
the logistic regression coefficients (see Appendix B,
Note 9). Once we control for differences in back-
ground characteristics (Model 4), we find that low
physical and emotional health status, deteriorating
health, and the presence of a work disability all
significantly affect the employment status of older
workers. As shown in Table 3, workers who had low
physical health status had 61% lower odds of being
employed than persons in good health. For those
workers with poor emotional health, the odds of
being employed decreased by 38%. Further, persons
experiencing deteriorating health status had 27%
lower odds of being employed than those in better
health. However, it is the presence of a work disabil-
ity that is the strongest predictor of employment
status, even after controlling for differences in hu-
man capital. For persons with a work limitation, the
odds of being employed are 95% lower than for their
nondisabled counterparts.
Although the additive effects of minority status did
not remain significant across all specifications, being
black and disabled reduced the odds of being em-
ployed by 46%. In contrast, being male and disabled
increased the odds of employment, most likely be-
cause of the need for men to continue working at
older ages. Only one of the economic resource vari-
ables, educational attainment, was tied to labor force
participation. For each additional year of schooling,
there was a 10% increase in the odds of being em-
ployed. As we also found in the gender-specific
models, this effect was consistent in both the male
and female equations. Finally, both men and women
who were married were 1.9 times more likely to be
employed than those who were not married.
The Impact of Disability on the Economic Well-Being
of Older Workers
Earlier descriptive statistics suggest that the costs
of disability status are particularly acute for women
and minorities with disabilities. In the following set
of analyses, we examine these effects, controlling for
differences in demographic characteristics and eco-
nomic resources. The results of the analyses on an-
nual earnings are presented in Table 4. Our full
specification provided the best fit for predicting the
earnings of older workers (R2 = .296). The results
show that health and disability indicators continue to
be significant predictors of the earnings of older
workers, regardless of gender and ethnicity. After
controlling for differences in background character-
istics, persons with work disabilities earned 25% less
than their nondisabled counterparts. Although all of
the additional health status measures were signifi-

cant in Model 1, only low physical health status
remained significant in Model 4. Persons who re-
ported low health status earned nearly 10% less than
persons who were in good physical health.
Two minority status variables -- those focusing on
gender -- remained significant in the full specifica-
tion models. Older men earned approximately 59%
more than older women. However, if a man was also
disabled, his annual earnings were reduced by 17%.
In addition, two economic resource variables, edu-
cational attainment and limited English language pro-
ficiency, also impacted earnings. Each additional
year of schooling completed increased earnings by
9%. However, for persons who had limited English
proficiency, an indicator of weaker attachments to
the labor force, annual earnings were 20% lower than
for their English-speaking counterparts.
Discussion
The presence of a work disability has a deleterious
effect on the labor supply and economic well-being
of older workers, regardless of race, ethnicity, or
gender. Across all groups, persons with disabilities
are less likely to work, and when employed, they
work for lower pay than their nondisabled counter-
parts. However, our descriptive analyses suggest that
these conditions are more acute for older minority
men and women. Further, disabled minority women,
particularly Latinas, are uniquely disadvantaged.
When compared to other persons with disabilities,
Latinas with disabilities have the lowest levels of
labor force participation and earnings.
Although the research on blacks and Latinos with
disabilities is limited, we would suggest that their
higher rates of disability reflect their overall position
of economic disadvantage in the United States. The
older minority population is more likely to have lived
in poverty at various times in adulthood. This would
increase the likelihood of poor health status as well as
limit utilization of preventive health services. More-
over, if these adults have extended periods of poor
health during adulthood, they have more likely than
not experienced greater barriers to employment op-
portunities. Restricted access to employment would
only exacerbate the economic deprivation of these
older workers. Thus, the linkages between health
status and economic status, particularly for minority
populations, require further investigation.
Our multivariate analyses revealed that the pres-
ence of a work limitation decreased the chances of
being employed and reduced the earnings of older
workers. Yet, the impact of other statuses was mixed.
Low health status and deteriorating health were gen-
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 307
erally significant predictors of reductions in labor
force participation and earnings. However, despite
the broad acceptance of the hypothesis that persons
with multiple minority statuses are uniquely disad-
vantaged, our analysis only provides partial support
for this thesis. The additional premiums associated
with these statuses seem to be most acute for black
men with disabilities. Does that suggest that double
or triple jeopardy is more rhetoric than substance?
Perhaps the results reflect the greater selectivity
among older minority individuals, particularly those
with disabilities, who continue to work. Nonethe-
less, although the effects of gender and Latino origin
seem to disappear in the reduced form models, our
ongoing analyses focusing on separate gender and
ethnic subgroups suggest that the underlying pro-
cesses generating patterns of labor force participa-
tion and earnings vary considerably across gender,
race and ethnic lines, and therefore, our empirical
models may need to be further refined to capture
these nuances.
We suspect that there may be a number of addi-
tional factors that may shape patterns of employment
and earnings, particularly for minority older workers,
that warrant further investigation. Of particular inter-
est is the extent to which employers provide accom-
modations to workers after the onset of work limita-
tions. Are employers more likely to provide these
accommodations for men, regardless of race, or for
Anglos, regardless of gender? Further, to what extent
are there differences across groups in familial sup-
port of the work efforts of persons with disabilities?
How does familial support work to enhance or hin-
der the employment of persons with disabilities?
These are some of the questions that can be ad-
dressed with the HRS data, and future work will focus
on addressing these issues. Moreover, our results
only capture these effects in a cross-sectional view of
the world. Do these patterns remain constant over
time? Are the effects of the predictors constant over
time? Are there changes in policy, such as the imple-
mentation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, that
will shape these patterns? As subsequent waves of
the Health and Retirement Survey become available,
the long-term effects of disability status on older
workers need to be addressed more fully.

Alternative Measures of Health Status and Disability
in the Health and Retirement Study
Self-Reported Measures
Physical Health Status. Respondents were asked to rate
their current physical health as excellent, good, fair
or poor.
Emotional Health Status. Respondents were asked to
rate their current emotional health as excellent, good,
fair or poor.
Deteriorating Health Status. Respondents were asked to
indicate whether their overall health status had im-
proved or worsened in the year prior to the interview.
Not in the Labor Force because of Disability. Respon-
dents who indicated that their current employment sta-
tus was one of not working because of disability.
Work Limitation. Respondents were asked to identify
any impairment or health problem that limits the kind or
amount of paid work.
Permanent Work Disability. Respondents were asked to
identify whether their work limitation was not a tempo-
rary condition.
Lost Work because of Illness. Respondents were asked
to indicate whether they had missed work in the past
year because of illness.
Days Lost from Work because of Illness. Respondents
were asked to enumerate the number of days they had
missed work in the last year because of illness.
Exposure to Work Hazards. Respondents were asked to
indicate whether they had been exposed to dangerous
chemicals or other work hazards (i.e., had to breathe
dusts, fumes, vapors, exposed to organic solvents or
pesticides at work).
Any Limitations or Impairment. Respondents were asked
to indicate if their activities were limited in any way
because of an impairment or problem.
Early Retirement due to Health Reasons. Respondents
were asked if their health or the health of other family
members were important reasons for their retirement.
Objective Measures
Sensory Impairment. Respondent reported that they
were blind, visually impaired, deaf, or hearing impaired.
Mobility Impairment. Respondent reported having had a
stroke, paralysis, arthritis, rheumatism, or problems
with back or limbs.
Presence of Chronic Illness. Respondent reported hav-
ing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, respira-
tory ailments, kidney or liver disease, digestive prob-
lems, high cholesterol.
Difficulties with Activities of Daily Life (ADL). Respon-
dents reported the degree of difficulty experienced
when performing one of 16 activities of daily life. These
activities included running; walking; sitting for long
periods of time; getting out of a chair or bed without
assistance; climbing stairs; lifting or carrying more then
10 pounds; bending; picking up small objects; bathing,
eating or dressing without assistance; pushing or pulling
large objects; or extending arms above shoulder level.
Receipt of Social Security Disability or Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) Benefits. Respondents were asked
to identify participation in the Social Security Disability
Insurance Program or the Supplemental Security In-
come Program.
Receipt of Veterans Administration (VA) Disability Bene-
fits. Respondents were asked to identify participation in
the Veterans Administration Disability Program.
Receipt of Workers Compensation. Respondent was
asked to identify participation in the Workers Compen-
sation Program because of work-related injury.
Receipt of Public Welfare Disability Benefits. Respon-
dents were asked to identify participation in Public
Welfare (i.e., General Assistance [CA] or Aid to Families
with Dependent Children [AFDC] Programs because of
disability).

Notes
1. Throughout the article we use the term Anglo to refer to
persons who identified themselves as white and of non-
Hispanic origin in the Health and Retirement Study.
2. Although this concept has been widely used and ac-
cepted in the literature, there has been relatively little
theoretical or empirical work that attempts to test as-
sumptions of cumulative disadvantage attributed to
possessing multiple minority statuses.
3. Although we have disaggregated our analyses for spe-
cific Latino origin groups, the small samples of Puerto
Ricans and Cubans in the Health and Retirement Survey
led us to focus on aggregate Latino findings.
4. The Gamma release of the HRS data tape was used in
this analysis.
5. Results for the separate gender and ethnic subgroups
are available upon request from the authors. We would
briefly mention that there were considerable differ-
ences across gender and ethnic lines in the effects of
the predictors. For example, the only significant predic-
tor of employment status across all models was the
presence of a work disability, with stronger effects
noted for Latinas and black men and women. The
reduced-form earnings equations revealed that al-
though disability status reduced the earnings of Anglos
and blacks, it was an insignificant predictor of Latino
earnings.
6. Cognizant of these concerns, we also ran analyses ex-
amining gender, racial, and ethnic differences in the
reporting of disabilities. According to the results of
these analyses, the odds of reporting a work disability
were 22% higher for older blacks and 46% higher for
people who were poor (defined as people earning less
than $12,000). However, in contrast to previous studies,
when we examined the interaction between minority
status and poverty, we found that poor women as well
as poor Mexican-Americans and blacks were signifi-
cantly less likely to report a work disability. In part, this
may reflect the need for poor individuals to continue to
work despite the existence of disabling conditions. A
copy of these analyses are available upon request.
7. In order to be eligible for disability benefits from Social
Security, applicants need to have been insured for at
least 20 quarters in the 40 quarters (10 years) preceding
the onset of disability, as well as have a disabling condi-
tion that Social Security physicians deem "perma-
nently" disabling (> 12 months) and that prevents the
applicant from obtaining gainful employment.
8. In this article, our discussion focuses on the effects on
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 309
labor supply and earnings of four health conditions: the
presence of a work limitation (v4001), general physical
health status (v301), general emotional health status
(v303), and changes in health status (v302). However, we
did some preliminary tests using alternative health sta-
tus indicators and found similar patterns of results.
9. The antilog represents the exponentiated value of the
regression coefficient B\ It is interpreted as the unit
change in the odds of Yoccurring given a unit change in
X. When the value of the antilog is greater than 1, it is
interpreted as the percent increase in the odds (or
number of times higher odds). When the antilog is less
than 1, the interpretation reflects a percent reduction in
the odds (1.00-antilog). If we use an example from Table
3, we see that the odds of being employed are reduced
by approximately 95% for persons with disabilities.
