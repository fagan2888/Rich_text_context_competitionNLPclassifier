Maintaining Functional Independence in Elderly
Adults: The Roles of Health Status
and Financial Resources in Predicting Home
Modifications and Use of Mobility Equipment
Kathleen M. Mathieson, MA,1 Jennie Jacobs Kronenfeld, PhD,1
and Verna M. Keith, PhD1
Purpose: We investigated whether health status (i.e., need
characteristics) and financial resources (i.e., enabling
characteristics) were important predictors of two types of
functional adaptations among elderly adults: home modi-
fications such as putting nonslip tape on rugs or installing
more telephones and use of equipment for mobility or ac-
tivities of daily living (ADLs) such as canes or walkers.
Design and Methods: Participants were identified from
the National Survey of Self-Care and Aging (n  3,485),
a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized
U.S. adults aged 65 and older. Need and enabling char-
acteristics were used to predict home modifications and
equipment use in multinomial logistic analysis, controlling
for predisposing characteristics. Results: Although sev-
eral health-status (need) variables had significant, direct
effects on functional adaptations, the effects of ADL limi-
tations were diminished at higher levels of impairment.
Among the financial (enabling) variables, subjective income
measures and supplemental insurance had significant, di-
rect effects on functional adaptations. Implications:
Promotion of functional adaptations among elderly peo-
ple may benefit from both a proactive approach that tar-
gets elders with few limitations and a consideration of
financial factors in addition to health status.
Key Words: Elderly adults, Disability, Functional
adaptations
The significance of the aging of the U.S. popula-
tion has been stated repeatedly. It is estimated that
by the year 2030, the number of older Americans
will nearly double, and older adults will make up
about 20% of the entire U.S. population (Abeles,
Gift, & Ory, 1994, p. 1). Such a demographic trend
brings with it many issues and challenges for health
and health care; although people are living longer,
they are also living with more chronic health condi-
tions and disabilities (Zimmer & Chappell, 1994).
These developments have implications for both the
formal health care system, such as increased ambu-
latory health care and short-term hospitalization
(Weiss & Lonnquist, 2000), and informal health
care, such as increased provision of elderly care by
adult children and greater use of home health care
services.
Although overall chronic disability among older
age groups has decreased in the last few decades
(Manton & Stallard, 1995, 1996), management of
disability and maintenance of functional indepen-
dence among elderly adults remain salient issues be-
cause of the growing proportion of older age groups.
Increasingly, research has emphasized the impor-
tance of health promotion (Nicholas, 1993) and
maintenance of functional independence (Zimmer &
Chappell, 1994) in older adults. Informal health care
practices have increasingly been cited as a way of
maintaining health and functioning among elders
while simultaneously reducing medical expenditures
(Edwardson, Dean, & Brauer, 1995; Jirovec &
Kasno, 1993; Kart & Engler, 1995).
In this study, we examined a specific type of infor-
mal care based on one of the three domains concep-
tualized by the Self-Care Assessment of Community-
Based Elderly Study (DeFriese, Konrad, Woomert,
Kincade Norburn, & Bernard, 1994, pp. 102­103):
functional adaptations that promote functional capa-
bility, including home modifications and equipment
use for mobility or activities of daily living (ADLs).
We focus on the importance of health status and
financial resources (i.e., need and enabling character-
istics) in determining the practice of home modifica-
tions and equipment use for mobility or ADLs.
Building on the health behavior model (HBM), we
hypothesized that poor health and physical limita-

tions have positive effects on the practice of func-
tional adaptations because they reflect a necessity for
such adaptations. More importantly, we hypothe-
sized that income and health insurance have positive
effects on the practice of functional adaptations, as
these financial resources can enable elders to make
adaptations.
Elderly persons often experience decreases in func-
tional ability and greater difficulty in performing ev-
eryday tasks (Verbrugge, Rennert, & Madans,
1997). The importance of functional adaptations in
moderating this increasing difficulty has been stated
frequently. For instance, Manton, Corder, and Stal-
lard (1993, p. 176) found that from 1982 to 1989,
dependence on equipment, both by itself and in com-
bination with personal assistance, increased, whereas
institutionalization rates were stable, and mortality
and chronic disability prevalence rates declined.
They concluded that incentives for equipment use
among elderly people can increase their social auton-
omy. Similarly, use of equipment assistance has been
shown to be effective for reducing and resolving lim-
itations, and, compared with personal assistance
from others, allows elders to maintain a greater sense
of self-sufficiency (Verbrugge et al., 1997). The bene-
fits of functional adaptations are not only realized at
the individual level, but have also been shown to af-
fect medical expenditures. In a recent study, Stearns
and colleagues (2000) found that certain lifestyle
practices and functional adaptations among elderly
adults were associated with reductions in Medicare
expenditures.
In sum, functional adaptations are related to many
positive outcomes for seniors, as well as concomitant
reductions in health care expenditures and less need
for institutionalization. Thus, research has begun to
focus on social factors associated with the likelihood
of using adaptations such as assistive devices (Gitlin,
Schemm, Landsberg, & Burgh, 1996; Mann, Hurren,
Tomita, & Charvat, 1995; Verbrugge et al., 1997;
Zimmer & Chappell, 1994), home modifications,
and personal assistance from others (Kincade Nor-
burn et al., 1995; Stearns et al., 2000). Although
these studies are informative, more research is
needed to increase our understanding of patterns of
functional-adaptation use. Knowledge about these
patterns can help inform interventions and education
aimed at increasing functional ability and indepen-
dence among elderly people.
Need and Enabling Characteristics
A conceptual model is valuable for developing an
understanding of the social patterns linked to the use
of functional adaptations. Andersen's (1968) HBM,
developed to help explain trends in health services
use, has been applied to several facets of informal
care (e.g., Kart & Engler, 1994, 1995; Mathieson,
2000). Initial attempts have shown that the behav-
ioral model is useful for studying the use of assistive
devices among elderly adults (Gitlin et al., 1996;
Zimmer & Chappell, 1994).
Under the behavioral model, predisposing charac-
teristics are factors existing prior to the onset of ill-
ness that may contribute to an individual's propen-
sity to use health services, enabling characteristics
refer to individual resources (income, health insur-
ance status) and community resources that allow in-
dividuals to access services, and need characteristics
refer to both perceived and evaluated health status
(Andersen & Newman, 1973).
This study builds on growing research using the
behavioral model to examine trends in informal
health practices. We focused specifically on the im-
portance of health status and financial resources (i.e.,
need and enabling characteristics) in predicting the
use of functional adaptations. We chose to concen-
trate on need and enabling characteristics for two
reasons. First, past research has found support for
the additive hypothesis which states that increased
need translates into increased use of adaptations
(Gitlin et al., 1996; Hartke, Prohaska, & Furner,
1998; Zimmer & Chappell, 1994). Second, certain
adaptations or devices may be costly and may not be
covered by Medicare. Whereas other studies focusing
on functional adaptations as an outcome have used
income level as a predictor (Hartke et al., 1998; Kin-
cade Norburn et al., 1995; Zimmer & Chappell,
1994), it has typically been included as a demo-
graphic control measure. We sought to explore the
enabling role of financial factors in more depth by
including not only an objective income measure, but
also several subjective measures relating to respon-
dents' perceptions of income sufficiency. Addition-
ally, we examined the potential enabling role of sup-
plemental health insurance for elders who want or
need to implement functional adaptations. This ex-
panded examination of enabling characteristics builds
on intriguing new research showing that extraindi-
vidual factors such as access to care and health insur-
ance are associated with greater odds of survival and
reduced likelihood of transitioning from indepen-
dence to disability among Medicare beneficiaries
(Porell & Miltiades, 2001). We are building on this
new research studying the effects of extraindividual
enabling factors and making a significant innovation
in that our outcome of interest is use of functional
adaptations instead of functional ability.
As stated, our hypotheses were that (a) poor
health and physical limitations have positive effects
on the practice of functional adaptations because
they reflect a necessity for such adaptations and (b)
income and health insurance have positive effects on
the practice of functional adaptations because they
can enable elders to make adaptations.
Methods
Data
The data for this study are derived from the Na-
tional Survey of Self-Care and Aging: Baseline,
1990­1991 (DeFriese & Kincade Norburn, 1996). A
stratified random sample of noninstitutionalized
Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age and older,
26 The Gerontologist
drawn from 50 primary sampling units (38 urban
and 12 rural) was obtained. The sample was strati-
fied by gender and age in the final stages, with over-
sampling of the oldest old (85 years old and older) to
facilitate subgroup analysis, and was selected pro-
portional to the urban/rural distribution of the el-
derly population. This sample is unique in that it is
representative of the total noninstitutionalized elderly
population of Medicare beneficiaries in the contigu-
ous United States (Kincade Norburn et al., 1995).
Questions pertained to the type and extent of self-
care behaviors for ADLs, management of chronic con-
ditions (through self-care activities, equipment use, and
environmental modifications), medical self-care for
acute conditions, and health promotion/disease pre-
vention. Social support, health services use, and socio-
demographic/economic variables were also included.
Dependent Variable Measures
Home Modifications.--Respondents were asked about
changes that they may have made to their homes in
the last 12 months. Changes included rearranging
furniture, keeping things within easy reach, and in-
stalling more telephones. Although we considered
coding this measure dichotomously (used any home
modifications vs. used none), preliminary results
showed that there were substantial differences be-
tween elders who used different numbers of modifi-
cations. To capture these differences, we used multi-
nomial logistic regression (see analysis section) to
contrast those using one, two, and three or more
modifications with those using zero modifications.
The average number of home modifications made
was 2.46 (SD  .97).
Equipment Use for Mobility or ADLs.
-- Respondents
were asked whether they had used 20 types of equip-
ment for mobility or ADLs in the past 12 months, in-
cluding lighter weight housecleaning equipment,
bath stools, canes, and walkers. As with home modi-
fications, there were differences in elders who used
different numbers of equipment types. This measure
was thus coded into the same categories as home
modifications. The average number of equipment
types used was 1.73 (SD  1.15).
Independent Measures
Table 1 details the means, standard deviations,
and coded values for the independent measures.
Predisposing Characteristics.--Because our focus is
on health status (need characteristics) and financial re-
sources (enabling characteristics), predisposing charac-
teristics were primarily used to control for confound-
ing, although we do briefly discuss their effects and the
magnitude of their explanatory power. Both demo-
graphic and social structural predisposing characteris-
tics were used. Demographic variables included age
(continuous), and gender (dichotomous). Social struc-
tural predisposing characteristics included race, retire-
ment status, education, and living alone. All of these
variables were measured dichotomously. There was
not an adequate representation of minority elders
to include multiple racial/ethnic categories. African
Americans composed about 5% of the sample; Ameri-
can Indians, 0.1%; Asians or Pacific Islanders, 0.3%;
and Hispanics, 3.4%. Therefore, race was coded as ei-
ther White (n  3,169) or minority (n  313), with
minorities as the reference group. Retirement status
was measured as being completely retired or still work-
ing in some capacity, and education was measured as
having at least a high school education or having less
than a high school education. Living situation was in-
cluded because it may affect an older person's informal
health behavior (Wolinsky & Johnson, 1991).
Enabling Characteristics.--The enabling character-
istics included five indicators of financial status--
1989 family income, whether the respondent receives
any income in addition to Social Security, how well
income takes care of basic needs, whether the re-
spondent has enough to buy little extras, and whether
the respondent has supplemental health insurance.
Income was measured using categories that ranged

from 1 to 12 (see bottom of Table 1 for details). Be-
cause of a high number of missing cases on income
(about 20%), missing values were replaced with the
mean value for the entire sample. Sensitivity testing
was conducted by running statistical models first us-
ing income with the mean replacing missing values
and second replacing missing income with means
computed on the basis of gender, education, and
race. There were no significant differences between
models. The three additional income variables were
included to give a more expanded picture of the role
financial resources, as well as individuals' percep-
tions of the adequacy of their resources, play in de-
termining functional adaptations. Income in addition
to Social Security was a dichotomous measure, as
was having enough to buy little extras. The measure
for how well income takes care of basic needs was
ordinal, with responses poorly, fairly well, and very
well. Supplemental health insurance was measured
dichotomously, and referred to health insurance that
respondents possess in addition to Medicare. In addi-
tion to these individual enabling characteristics, one
community-enabling characteristic, rural residence,
was included as a dichotomous measure.
Need Characteristics.--Need characteristics are an
important component of the behavioral model; for a
person to seek care, she or he must first have or per-
ceive some medical need. This study used one ques-
tion on perceived health status, "How is your health
at the present time?" with responses of 1  excellent,
2  very good, 3  good, 4  fair, and 5  poor.
Three ADL-limitation measures were used as objec-
tive indicators of health status: basic (BADL), mobil-
ity (MADL), and instrumental (IADL). BADLs in-
cluded eating, dressing, bathing, and maintaining
continence; MADLs included getting to the toilet,
transferring from bed or chairs, getting outside, and
walking; and IADLs included using a telephone,
managing money, preparing meals, doing light house-
work, shopping, and doing heavy housework.
Chronic conditions were also used as an objective
measure of need. This item was measured through
two series of questions. Respondents were first asked
if they had experienced several conditions in the past
year: arthritis/rheumatism, diabetes, asthma/emphy-
sema/bronchitis, gastric/peptic ulcers, and anemia.
Second, respondents were asked if they had ever ex-
perienced any of the following conditions: osteoporo-
sis, a broken hip, hypertension, coronary heart disease/
angina pectoris/heart attack, stroke, cancer, glaucoma,
and cataracts. A sum of the total illnesses each re-
spondent had experienced was created through these
items, with possible values ranging from 0 to 13. Be-
cause only about 11% of cases reported five or more
of these, chronic conditions were recoded into the
categories 0  zero, 1  one, 2  two, 3  three, 4 
four, and 5  five or more.
As other researchers have noted, some overlap
among the components of the behavioral model can
be expected. If independent variables are correlated
at the .85 level or higher, however, they are redun-
dant and should not be included in the same analysis
(Kline, 1998). To test for possible multicollinearity,
we examined bivariate correlations among all inde-
pendent variables, and none of the correlations
reached the .85 level. Although this method cannot
completely rule out multicollinearity, it did suggest
that multicollinearity was not present.
Analysis
Multinomial logistic regression was used to exam-
ine both functional adaptations. This type of analysis
has the capacity to analyze outcomes with more than
two discrete categories and describes the odds of re-
sponse in one category instead of another (Agresti,
1996, p. 205). For a categorical variable with J cate-
gories, J  1 regression equations are estimated. In
this case, the number of categories for each outcome
variable was four, so three regression equations were
estimated (displayed in the columns of Tables 2 and
3). We used SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) which is
capable of fitting all three equations simultaneously.
In multinomial logistic analysis, each response cat-
egory is paired with a baseline or reference category,
which in this case was elders who used zero home
modifications and zero equipment types, respec-
tively. Every other category was compared to the ref-
erence category. The results thus show the odds of
response in the one category compared with the zero
category (Equation 1), the odds of response in the
two category compared with the zero category
(Equation 2), and the odds of response in the three or
more category compared with the zero category
(Equation 3; Agresti, 1996). Interpretation may be
done through odds ratios (exp{}) or by convert-
ing coefficients into a percentage change in odds
[(exp{}1)  100]. For instance, a coefficient of .25
in the equation comparing those who used one ver-
sus zero home modifications could be interpreted in
two ways: a one-unit increase in the independent
variable multiplies the odds of using one home modi-
fication instead of zero by 1.28 (exp{.25}). Or, a one-
unit increase in the independent variable increases
the odds of using one home modification instead of
zero by 28% [(exp{.25}1)  100]. The type of in-
terpretation used is a matter of preference, and we
use both types in discussing results.
The Nagelkereke pseudo R2 was used to estimate
the amount of variance in home modifications and
equipment use explained by the predictors. This
measure is an adjusted version of the Cox and Snell
R2, which is based on the log likelihood for the fitted
model compared with the log likelihood for the null
model (with no predictors). Although the Cox and
Snell R2 has a maximum value of less than 1, even
for a perfect model, the Nagelkerke R2 adjusts the
scale of the statistic to cover the full range from 0 to
1 (Nagelkerke, 1991). Separate hierarchical analysis
was also conducted to determine the relative impor-
tance of predisposing, enabling, and need character-
istics in explaining each outcome variable. Although
the results of the hierarchical analyses are not shown,
they are discussed in the context of other findings.
28 The Gerontologist
Whereas our first hypothesis states that poor
health is directly related to functional adaptations,
once a certain level of need is reached, this relation-
ship may diminish. For example, if a person is bed-
ridden, she or he may be less likely to use adapta-
tions compared with someone who simply has
trouble moving about, reaching items on shelves, and
so on. Put simply, it is possible that the direct effect
of poor health is more pronounced for those with
better health and less pronounced for those with

worse health. Thus, we conducted separate analyses
to test whether an inverted -shaped relationship ex-
isted between need characteristics and each outcome.
This was done by separately entering quadratic terms
(e.g., BADLS  BADLS) for each need characteristic
into the analysis for home adaptations and equip-
ment use, respectively. Quadratic terms show whether
the effects of a variable are constant or whether they
change across levels of that variable. These results,
too, are not shown but are discussed.
Results
Home Modifications
The multinomial logistic results for home modifi-
cations are shown in Table 2. Older age was associ-
ated with increased odds of using two instead of zero
modifications in Equation 2, but did not have a sig-
nificant effect in Equations 1 or 3. There were sig-
nificant gender differences in Equations 2 and 3;
women were more likely to use modifications. For
instance, in Equation 3, being female increased the
odds of using three or more modifications instead of
zero by 87%. Living alone was significant only in
Equation 3. Living alone increased the odds of using
three or more instead of zero modifications by 64%.
In the hierarchical analysis, predisposing characteris-
tics explained 7% of the variance in home modifica-
tions (Nagelkerke R2  .070).
The effects of the enabling characteristics in Table
2 are interesting as well as somewhat counterintui-
tive. Household income had a significant negative ef-
fect in Equation 2. That is, higher household incomes
decreased the odds of making home modifications.
This is the opposite of what we expected. Two other
income-related variables, however, were significant
and positive. Those who believed their income took
care of their basic needs had higher odds of using
modifications (Equation 3), as did those who had
enough income to buy little extras (Equation 1).
These results seem contradictory. It may be that the
actual level of household income is less important
than respondents' perceptions of the adequacy of
their income; the perceived measures had much more
substantial effects (more robust coefficients) than did
household income. Additionally, given that the sur-
vey concerned only the past 12 months, it is possible
that those with adequate income were able to imple-
ment adaptations earlier.
Supplemental insurance had significant positive ef-
fects on home modifications in Equations 1 and 3,
lending further support to the enabling role of finan-
cially related resources. In Equation 3, being a rural
resident increased the odds of using three or more
versus zero modifications by 46%. Although several
enabling characteristics had significant and robust ef-
fects on home modifications, in hierarchical analysis
enabling characteristics explained only about 2% of
the variance in home modifications over and above
that explained by predisposing characteristics (Na-
gelkerke R2  .088). Thus, enabling characteristics as
a whole did not add substantial explanatory power.
This is consistent, however, with past research using
the HBM; enabling characteristics typically explain
only a small proportion of health behaviors (Ander-
sen & Newman, 1973; Wolinsky & Johnson, 1991).
The results for the need characteristics show that
chronic conditions, perceived health, and MADL limi-
tations were significant for all numbers of home modi-
fications. In Equation 3, a one-unit increase in chronic
conditions multiplies the odds of using three or more
modifications instead of zero by 1.17; a one-unit in-
crease in poor perceived health (e.g., from fair to poor)
multiplies the odds of using three or more modifica-
tions instead of none by 1.31; and a one-unit increase
in MADL limitations multiplies the odds of using three
or more home modifications instead of none by 1.68.
Similarly, IADL limitations had significant positive ef-
fects in Equations 2 and 3. In addition, need character-
istics were very important in predicting use of home
modifications; in hierarchical analysis the explained
variance rose from about 9% to 24% (Nagelkerke
R2  .236) when need characteristics were added to
predisposing and enabling characteristics.
In the separate analysis to test whether the effects
of need characteristics were linear, we found that
BADL, IADL, and MADL limitations actually had
inverted -shaped effects. Quadratic terms for these
ADL measures (e.g., ADLs  ADLs) were statisti-
cally significant and negative, whereas the nonqua-
dratic terms (e.g., ADLs) remained significant and
positive. Thus, the direct effects of these ADL limita-
tions on home modifications were diminished at higher
levels of limitation.
Equipment Use for Mobility or ADL
Table 3 details the multinomial regression results
for equipment use. Age and gender had significant ef-
fects regardless of the number of equipment types.
Older age was associated with increased odds of
equipment use, as was female gender. Education and
retirement status were significant in Equation 1.
Having at least a high school education decreased the
odds of using one versus zero equipment types by
20%, and being completely retired increased the
odds of using one versus zero equipment types by
43%. In hierarchical analysis, predisposing charac-
teristics accounted for about 12% of the variance in
equipment use (Nagelkerke R2  .117).
The effects of enabling characteristics on equip-
ment use were similar to those for home modifica-
tions. Whereas household income was significant
and negative (Equation 3), having income in addition
to Social Security had positive effects and was signif-
icant across equations. Again, differences in the mag-
nitude of the effects are worth noting. In Equation 3,
for example, a one-unit increase in household in-
come decreased the odds of using three instead of
zero equipment types by only 7%, compared with a
55% increase in odds caused by having income in
addition to Social Security. Furthermore, having sup-
plemental health insurance appears to act as an im-
30 The Gerontologist
portant enabling characteristic for the use of equip-
ment. In Equation 3, for example, possessing insurance
in addition to Medicare multiplied the odds of using
assistive equipment by 1.76. Similar results between
home modifications and equipment use emerged
with regard to explanatory power. Enabling charac-
teristics explained only 2% of the variance in equip-
ment use over and above that explained by predis-
posing characteristics (Nagelkerke R2  .136).
As with home modifications, the importance of
need characteristics for equipment use is clear.
Chronic conditions, BADL limitations, IADL limita-
tions, and MADL limitations all had significant posi-
tive effects in at least two equations. Furthermore, in
hierarchical analysis need characteristics accounted
for an additional 15% of the variance in equipment
use beyond that explained by predisposing and en-
abling characteristics combined (Nagelkerke R2 
.294). Similar to the findings for home modifica-
tions, two need characteristics, MADL and IADL
limitations, had inverted -shaped effects. Thus, the
direct effects of these ADL measures on equipment
use were diminished at higher levels of limitation.
Discussion
This study examined the correlates of functional
adaptations among older adults in the context of the
HBM. Specifically, we sought to explore the impact
of health status and financial resources on functional
adaptations, with the rationale that poor health ne-
cessitates adaptations, whereas financial resources
enable one to make adaptations. In this section, we
discuss some limitations of the data set used in this
study, as well as the implications of our findings for
future research and for programs aimed at promot-
ing positive health behaviors such as functional ad-
aptations among elders.
Considerable support was found for our first hy-
pothesis that poor health and physical limitations
have positive effects on the practice of functional ad-
aptations. Many health-related variables (i.e., need
characteristics) are important in predicting functional
adaptations, including chronic conditions, perceived
health, and MADL limitations for home modifications
and chronic conditions, IADL limitations, and MADL
limitations for equipment use. Moreover, a sizeable
portion of variance in functional adaptations is ex-
plained by these need characteristics, as is in keeping
with past research using the behavioral model.
Although our findings lend credence to the addi-
tive hypothesis that increased need translates into in-
creased use of adaptations (Gitlin et al., 1996;
Hartke et al., 1998; Zimmer & Chappell, 1994),
they also inform this hypothesis by showing that the
effect of need is not linear, but diminishes at higher
levels of impairment. That is, whereas the effects of
ADL limitations on functional adaptations remain
positive, these effects are more substantial for elders
with less disability and less substantial for elders
with more disability. From a public health perspec-
tive, these findings can inform efforts to increase
functional independence among seniors through the
use of home modifications and/or equipment use.
Specifically, promotion of functional adaptations
may benefit from using a proactive approach and
targeting those who have few or no limitations, as
these lifestyle changes may help seniors adapt to ad-
ditional limitations in the future.
Enabling characteristics such as health insurance
and income did not add substantially to the ex-
plained variance in either type of functional adapta-
tion. This, however, is consistent with the findings of
past research using the behavioral model. That is, en-
abling characteristics typically do not account for
much of the variance in health behaviors. In addi-
tion, although some findings are counterintuitive, the
effects of income and health insurance on functional
adaptations are intriguing and offer some support
for our second hypothesis that enabling characteris-
tics have positive effects on the practice of functional
adaptations. For both home modifications and
equipment use, household income had significant
negative effects in one equation, whereas other in-
come-related factors (income takes care of basic
needs, have enough to buy little extras, and income
in addition to Social Security) had significant positive
effects. The magnitude of the household income ef-
fects, however, is much smaller than that of the other
income-related variables. As noted, the effect of
more subjective income measures, such as a belief
that income takes care of basic needs, may be more
important than actual income level. There are other
possibilities as well. For example, gender may inter-
act with income. That is, older women are more
likely to use adaptations and have lower incomes
than older men do. Conversely, older men are less
likely to use adaptations and have higher incomes
than older women do. We tested an interaction be-
tween gender and income, however, and none of the
results were statistically significant. It is also possible
that older men, who have higher incomes and are
more likely to have a spouse that is still living, have
less need for adaptations because they get help from
their spouses. This could contribute to the negative
relationship we found between income and adapta-
tions. Most likely, the relationships are complex and
potentially involve multiple factors such as age, gen-
der, marital status, living arrangements, and finan-
cial resources. Further research is needed to explore
the relationship between household income and
functional adaptations in more depth.
Supplemental insurance does appear to act as an
enabling factor for both home modifications and
equipment use, although for home modifications the
relationship is not consistent across equations. This
could be due to the fact that some home modifications
are easily made at no cost, such as rearranging furni-
ture or moving items to lower shelves, whereas equip-
ment must almost always be purchased, and is more
often covered by health insurance. These results build
on recent findings on the role of supplementary health
insurance in decreasing the likelihood of becoming
ADL disabled and improving survival outcomes
31

among Medicare beneficiaries (Porell & Miltiades,
2001). Supplemental health insurance appears to act
as an enabling factor not only with regard to health
and disability status, but also with regard to adapta-
tions that can increase independence among elders.
Some limitations of this study are worth noting.
First, the amount of missing data on the income vari-
able is high, and although we strove to handle this
problem in a methodologically sound way, we can-
not conclude that we fully solved this problem. It
may be that some of the contrasting findings on ob-
jective and perceived financial measures are due to
the large amount of missing data on income. In addi-
tion, some limitations arise from the fact that sec-
ondary data were used. For instance, there are inde-
pendent measures included in other studies that use
the HBM that were not available in the present data,
such as health beliefs, attitudes toward health ser-
vices, price of health services, and provider-to-popu-
lation ratios. If we were to design a study with newly
collected data, we would include the complete set of
independent measures associated with the HBM.
Similarly, the data used in this study are cross-sec-
tional, and thus provide only a "snapshot" of statis-
tical relationships. Furthermore, it is possible that
some functional adaptations were made prior to the
12-month period respondents were asked about and
were thus missed in this study. For these reasons, we
feel longitudinal investigations have great potential
for shedding more light on the complex factors relat-
ing to functional adaptations and how these affect
health and functioning among elderly people.
The findings of this study have several important
implications for public health and future research.
First, considering that the effects of ADL impair-
ments on home modifications and equipment use are
diminished at higher levels of impairment, promo-
tion of functional adaptations may benefit from tar-
geting elders who have few or no limitations. With
this type of proactive approach, elders may imple-
ment or be aware of functional adaptations that can
help them cope with additional limitations in the fu-
ture. Second, given our provocative findings on the
effects of financial enabling characteristics, we sug-
gest that future research continue to explore how
both objective and subjective economic resources in-
fluence the use of functional adaptations among el-
ders. In particular, because Medicare Part B helps pay
for certain types of medically necessary equipment, fu-
ture research should examine to what extent this cov-
erage removes financial barriers and enables individu-
als to implement assistive equipment adaptations.
Finally, programs aimed at promotion of functional
adaptations to improve the quality of life among el-
ders will likely be more effective if financial factors as
well as level of need are taken into consideration.
