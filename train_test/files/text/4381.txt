Introduction
In this article, the authors address issues of mentoring with
domestic graduate students and junior faculty, particularly
those of color, and including women. We are concerned with
ways that strengthen their completion of the PhD for knowl-
edge production. Our thinking is aligned with that of
Donaldson and Crowley (1978) in that we seek to support
students in becoming academically prepared in descriptive
knowledge production, rather than prescriptive knowledge
leading to practical implementation in professional disci-
plines. Our goal is to support junior researchers and scholars
in ways that assist them in developing strong research and
scholarly careers without compromising their cultural back-
ground. The article begins with an integrative review of the
mentoring literature and moves to a discussion of our collec-
tive mentoring experiences to address how individuals and
organizations in our society are deprived when members
from cultural communities of our focus are not provided effi-
cacious mentoring. The essay considers such issues as col-
lective approaches to holistic mentoring that engage mentees'
cultural foundations and completion of knowledge-produc-
tion PhDs, while addressing the development of sustainable
professional and scholarly research careers.
Students of color, which we use to refer collectively to the
demographic groups of Native, African, and Chicano/Latin
Americans, have been historically excluded from higher edu-
cation and remain underrepresented in doctoral programs.
These students were awarded 13.8% of earned doctorates in
2011 (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for
Education Statistics, 2012), although Native, African, and
Chicano/Latin Americans comprise nearly 30% of the U.S.
population (Humes, Jones, & Ramirez, 2011). In particular,
post-baccalaureate African American women have been
reported to have especially challenging and isolating experi-
ences in primarily White institutions (Ellis, 2001; Johnson-
Bailey, Valentine, Cervero, & Bowles, 2009; King &
Chepyator-Thomson, 1996; Shavers & Moore, 2014; Turner
& Thompson, 1993). In 2012, African American women
made up 16.4% of all post-baccalaureate women (U.S.
Department of Education, National Center for Education
Statistics, 2012). By comparison, African American women
faculty members represent a much lower percentage, that is,
3%, of all full-time faculty members (U.S. Department of
Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2013).
These numbers confirm the reported dearth of available
women of color to serve as faculty mentors for women of the
same background (King & Chepyator-Thomson, 1996;
Woods, 2001).

Guiding the Way: Mentoring Graduate
Students and Junior Faculty for
Sustainable Academic Careers

Abstract
This article introduces the reader to literature, ideas, and processes the authors have used in mentoring graduate students
and junior faculty of color, including women. The writing is based on an integrative review of literature engaging mentoring
processes and the authors' collective experiences as they have worked to guide members of a mentoring collective as well
as domestic graduate students and junior faculty from the above populations. Goals of our mentoring efforts are to provide
graduate students and junior faculty who are from U.S. cultural communities historically excluded from higher education with
experiences that help them complete the PhD and develop professional academic careers that are successful and have impact
in their chosen disciplinary arena. The article presents a mentoring process model that prepares individuals for professional
careers that integrate the work of knowledge production in research, teaching, and service that embraces the cultural
heritages of the mentees' background.

Currently, our nation's professional and academic envi-
ronments regularly reinforce self-promotion, competitive
personal ambition, and individualized career advances
(Casadevall & Fang, 2012). Most mentoring approaches in
our country tend to focus on preparing individuals to single-
mindedly compete in such environments with little acknowl-
edgment of possible alternatives. This falsely promotes
academia as an individualistic arena in which one seeks to
make singular contributions to be worthy of individual merit
and rewards. Such a posture goes against the very nature of
the human species and the reality of scientific knowledge
production as a "community effort comprising innumerable
interdependent contributions" (Casadevall & Fang, 2012,
p. 893). Furthermore, for students of color and women, indi-
vidualistic approaches are largely contrary to more prevalent
community-focused or collectivist approaches that may be
active in their communities of origin and/or socialization
(Coon & Kemmelmeier, 2001; Gaines et al., 1997; J. L.
Smith, Cech, Metz, Huntoon, & Moyer, 2014; Su, Rounds, &
Armstrong, 2009). We propose that there are more produc-
tive, successful, systematic, and integrated approaches to
mentoring graduate students and junior faculty than the indi-
vidualistic and competitive-oriented ideological posture cur-
rently operative in too many academic settings. In this article,
we propose one such alternative mentoring model, particu-
larly for domestic individuals of color and women, which
aids in mentees'comprehending that their career of teaching,
research, and service activities can be accomplished as inte-
grated efforts. We maintain that such mentoring can encom-
pass personal integrity as well as the mentees'cultural values
(Dodson, Montgomery, & Brown, 2009).
Rationale and Significance
No matter the economic phase, our democratic society has a
continuing need for exceptionally well-educated, well-
trained graduate students and junior faculty to assume peda-
gogical and leadership roles related to basic knowledge
production and higher education. The need for such intellec-
tual leadership is critical (Burns, 1978; Macfarlane, 2012;
Pitre, 2008), and this is in addition to the acquired technical
skills--data collection and analysis, mathematical manipula-
tion and calculation, academic writing, and many more--
that are related to specialized arenas of academic preparation.
Even if every U.S. citizen were maximally employed, we
would still need a well-prepared cadre of professionals
responsible to think through, and train others to rigorously
engage in basic social, biological, political, physical, eco-
nomic, human services, and other issues of collective life
within the global context of our complex 21st-century lives
(Macfarlane, 2012). Equally needed is a well-prepared pool
of professionals who represent the demographic distribution
of our nation's citizen population, including persons whose
cultural communities have historically been marginalized
within U.S. higher education. It is a basic mandate of our
democratic ethos and societal values to achieve equitable
participation from members of the total citizen population to
seriously engage and train others to think deeply through
basic issues associated with collective living (McGee Banks,
1995). This article focuses on these issues as we describe and
discuss ways to enhance the preparation of domestic students
and junior faculty of color, including women, through men-
toring processes that assist in completing the PhD and pre-
paring for a professional career that integrates the work of
research, teaching, and service for knowledge production
without compromising cultural heritages of their
background.
Literature Review: Advising for
Completion Versus Mentoring for
Career Sustainability
Within most literature, the framework for mentoring indi-
viduals toward academic careers that focuses on knowledge
production has largely addressed a need to produce persons
who can conduct "independent" investigations. Such
research work has largely been understood as individualistic
in nature and supposedly produces evidence of the research-
er's ability to think independently and make his or her singu-
lar contributions to the discipline of choice (Bagilhole &
Goode, 2001; Casadevall & Fang, 2012; Seonghee &
Boryung, 2008). In so doing, such persons are, or more likely
may be, deemed to be worthy of singularly focused recogni-
tion, with an ultimate reward being the granting of tenure in
a department at a university or other academic organization
based on such contributions to a discipline. Toward this end,
many view mentoring students from citizen populations
underrepresented in academia as primarily a transfer of "cul-
tural capital" associated with educational arenas, as that is
deemed needed to progress and demonstrate individual
merit.
The concept of cultural capital is frequently used to
describe, but is not limited to, "knowledge and other advan-
tages that people possess that help them to succeed in their
endeavors, such as negotiating educational systems"
(Chanderbhan-Forde, Heppner, & Borman, 2012; p. 180). It
has been argued that increasing the cultural capital of indi-
viduals from underrepresented domestic populations within
educational systems can be one outcome of faculty mentor-
ing and developmental engagement with students and junior
faculty members (Chanderbhan-Forde et al., 2012; Ovink &
Veazey, 2011; Whittaker & Montgomery, 2012, 2014).
Similarly, the lack of understanding about or access to such
cultural capital has been viewed as a major impediment for
such persons' career advancement (Chanderbhan-Forde et
al., 2012; Ovink & Veazey, 2011; Whittaker & Montgomery,
2012, 2014). However, this argument could be viewed as
encompassing the presumption that cultural heritages of our
country's diverse populations should be abdicated for indi-
viduals to assume the presumed and often false value of a
Montgomery et al. 3
universal "academic educational career." The reality is that
our diverse communities too have cultural capital that also
can be included in educational processes of a democratic
nation.
Even when speaking generally, effective mentoring with
graduate students and junior faculty requires that we concep-
tualize and implement a process that extends beyond build-
ing early career individuals' disciplinary knowledge and
integrates socialization for future careers. This is even more
critical when mentoring with individuals from U.S. domestic
populations historically excluded from mainstream higher
education as they regularly have little to no exposure to aca-
demia and its processes (e.g., Anglin & Wade, 2007; Dodson
et al., 2009; Gasman, Hirschfeld, & Vultaggio, 2008;
Johnson-Bailey, 2004). One implication of this understand-
ing is that mentoring with the aforementioned groups requires
extensive time investments by faculty members, who them-
selves are usually from populations underrepresented in aca-
demia (e.g., Antonio, 2002; Gilligan et al., 2007; Griffin,
2012b, 2013; Hayes, 2010; Hurtado et al., 2011; Merchant &
Omary, 2010; O'Rourke, 2008; Whittaker & Montgomery,
2012). As we consider the "individual success" model and
context of U.S. mentoring, the time a faculty person devotes
to interacting with graduate students and/or junior faculty
members can be, and often is, viewed as a distraction from
the mentoring faculty's personal research agenda and career
progress (Griffin, 2012a, 2012b; Wall, 2009). Educational
researchers and faculty members have acknowledged the
potential impact on one's career of serving as students'
invested and experienced senior advisor. Their findings sug-
gest that faculty mentoring efforts are frequently not recog-
nized or rewarded in the formal organizational review and
promotion processes (Antonio, 2002; Gilligan et al., 2007;
Hayes, 2010; Hurtado et al., 2011; Merchant & Omary, 2010;
O'Rourke, 2008; Shavers & Moore, 2014; Whittaker &
Montgomery, 2012, 2014).
Such findings and attitudes also suggest a strong need for
enhanced socialization of existing faculty concerning ideas
behind mentoring, as well as its practice (Gasman et al.,
2008; Griffin, 2012b). Faculty need to comprehend that men-
toring is an opportunity "to simultaneously counsel and col-
laborate" (Griffin, 2012a, p. 2). It is a faculty-engagement
opportunity that can effectively promote the integration of
research, teaching, and mentoring to leverage faculty mem-
bers' efforts as collaborating contributors in the larger orga-
nizational goals of student development and faculty success
(Hart, Grogan, Litt, & Worthington, 2009; O'Meara &
Braskamp, 2005; Whittaker & Montgomery, 2014).
Mentoring is also an opportunity to demonstrate that faculty
members are making strategic career choices that demon-
strate successful integrative research, teaching, and service
while strengthening the practice of a stronger higher educa-
tion for our society's next educating/pedagogical generation
(Whittaker & Montgomery, 2014).
Contemporary, normative approaches for advising stu-
dents contrast sharply with opportunities for expanding
faculty approaches to mentoring. The majority of current
approaches for preparing faculty to be strong mentors are
observational in nature wherein mentees are expected to
intrinsically learn the skills and craft of mentoring from their
experiences of having been carefully advised rather than
from structured guidance in efficacious mentoring (Griffin,
2012b). Structured opportunities for developing and practic-
ing successful career skills have been noted as lacking during
graduate and post-doctoral training, and generally are left to
individual observation and/or incorporation (Gibbs &
Griffin, 2013). It is the structured guidance of graduate stu-
dents and junior faculty that best prepares them to receive
and benefit from comprehensive mentoring (Griffin &
Toldson, 2012) and to prepare them with the ability to make
informed decisions and strategic moves in developing and
sustaining their careers (Gibbs & Griffin, 2013).
The committed relationship of structured guidance is
much more in line with mentoring rather than the advising
process of transferring information that may help an individ-
ual navigate a curriculum. A mentor should serve a deeper
purpose that has been aptly described as "one who observes,
calls out and cultivates unrealized potential in others"
(Griffin & Toldson, 2012, p. 103). To accomplish this, a
mentor must invest time in getting to know each mentee's
strengths and weaknesses so well that the mentor is able to
identify "a glimmer of potential and . . . is willing to engage
in `a fine archeological dig' to move the student from aver-
age to excellent" (Dr. Harold Cheatham as quoted in Griffin
& Toldson, 2012, p. 103).
The authors of this article propose a distinction between
advising and mentoring that is critical for guiding graduate
students, junior faculty, and women from underrepresented
domestic populations toward PhD completion and embark-
ing on sustainable and impactful professional academic
careers. We contend that an advisor is one who provides gen-
eral curriculum advice about adherence to rules and/or stan-
dards that apply for any student in a particular educational
program (e.g., Baker & Griffin, 2010; Ramirez, 2012).
However, mentoring is a significantly deeper relationship,
one in which the mentor and mentee commit to meaningful
and honest sharing to support a particular individual. The
sharing allows the mentor to develop a multifaceted personal
understanding of the mentee and provide committed assis-
tance in order that the mentee progresses toward achieving
his or her academic professional goals (Baker & Griffin,
2010; Kirchmeyer, 2005; Ramirez, 2012). Clearly, this
understanding makes the mentoring relationship a dynamic
bilateral exchange and transfer of knowledge in true collab-
orative thinking, planning, and action for the mentee's career
trajectory. We support this level of engagement as part of an
integrated approach to creating sustainable careers. Based on
our work with domestic graduate students and junior faculty
from underrepresented populations, we present our experi-
ences regarding specific activities, actions, and consider-
ations that have proven valuable and effective for achieving
such objectives.

Major Concepts: Conceptualization of
Career, Mentoring, and Social Capital
Without clarity in how we define major concepts that have
guided our work, it is not possible to delve into complex
details of how the authors have mentored with persons of
color and women for successful careers in higher education.
We begin with an alternative working definition of "career"
as going beyond any particular "job" a person may have or
do. We contend that career includes a job--even two or
more, but career is an arena of life work in which a person
surrounds herself or himself; an arena in which they are sus-
tained through all aspects and phases of their living; it is
infinitely larger than "an individual job." A job may be
working activities that allow for financial and material sur-
vival (Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Rozin, & Schwartz, 1997),
but a career provides for physical survival even as it nurtures
the professional soul, uplifts personal emotions, and enhances
one's intellect. Career has been described as "the pattern of
work-related experiences that span the course of a person's
life" (Greenhaus, Callanan, & Godschalk, 2000, p. 9).
However, career is not limited to single-minded focus on
specific tasks or work activities (Porter, 2005). Rather, within
our concept, an individual in the work of his or her career has
acquired effective professional, social, and emotional skills,
as well as a conscious awareness about the use of such skills
to help balance career activities with other life arenas. Our
concept of career can begin or end with a related or unrelated
job that might be thought of as forming bookends around the
longtime, life activities of career.
In addition to satisfying the need for employment, careers
reflect individual interests and preferences, and are generally
flexible enough to allow innovative changes within the
career. Academic careers may be based in a university or
other educational campuses, but they are not exclusive to
that arena of service to society or societal functioning. Strong
academic careers can be located in service sectors and/or be
part of an entrepreneurial focus. Matrix measuring tools may
be used to evaluate successful progression in career arenas,
but the tools usually must be adjusted to particulars of indi-
vidual goals and accomplishments rather than adjusting spe-
cifics of the career to matrix evaluating tools, particularly
those established and imposed by external entities.
We have already eluded to distinctions between activities
of "advising" and "mentoring," and it must be remembered
that all mentoring of graduate students and/or junior faculty
includes advising but not all advising equates mentoring;
indeed, most do not. For much of U.S. academic history,
many university faculty members have been assigned one or
more graduate students and/or junior faculty as advisees, but
these academic professionals do not necessarily provide the
more encompassing structured guidance of a mentoring
assignment. Advisors are available to aid students and/or
junior faculty in identifying appropriate courses, books,
instructors, and other particulars regarding completion of an
educational curriculum, or to navigate the bureaucracy of a
particular school or assignment. However, mentors provide
students and junior faculty with guidance on the many social
and political details of preparing for and implementing a suc-
cessful and sustainable academic career. More important,
mentors systematically make it a point to introduce their
mentee(s) to people, places, attitudes, materials, and opportu-
nities that serve as stepping stones to a successful and sustain-
able career; they share their professional skills and networks.
Unlike many if not most academic professionals, mentors
conceptualize pursuit of the PhD well beyond boundaries of
particularized curricula training and "skills acquisition" that
is part and parcel of contemporary U.S. doctorate graduate
education. Mentors see knowledge production as a much
larger process and set of activities. Persons acquiring a PhD
for knowledge production and using our concept of mentor
and mentoring will obtain disciplinary skills and also have
practical exposure and experience that has been integrated
with appropriate social, political, and other cultural situa-
tions that occur and reoccur within arenas of academic
careers. We contend that this type of knowledge and skills
acquisition, often referred to as social capital (Bourdieu,
1986; Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1995; White, 2002), is criti-
cal for those whose cultural communities have been histori-
cally and systematically excluded from the social context of
higher education and those preparatory exposures that feed
into that context. These individuals bring years of knowledge
with and from their cultural heritage as they enter higher
education but such knowledge is often not valued or used
(Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; Grant & Simmons,
2008). Often, there is conflict between higher education--
process and atmosphere--and students' cultural knowledge,
and adjusting to specific behavioral information and prac-
tices of the educational environment can be arduous. There
are additional concepts that inform our mentoring work;
however, the conceptualization of career, mentoring, and
social capital are felt to be the most salient for exploring
issues of this article.
What Experience Has Taught
The authors have brought experience and exposure from a
variety of academic arenas partnered with work with a men-
toring collective at Michigan State University, a large
research university, which has helped stimulate this and other
writings. The African Atlantic Research Team is a collective
that was organized some 16 years ago. The intent has been to
support students from communities traditionally excluded
and/or underrepresented in the academy, as well as women in
their pursuit of knowledge-production doctorate degrees. We
have found that systems and efforts aimed at preparing these
students as well as junior faculty are often deemed as suspect
when the process of preparation does not support the pursuit
of individualized competitive careers. A key principle that
we have learned from years of our mentoring efforts is that
human beings learn and work most effectively in a collective
even as an individual's well-being and development are of
Montgomery et al. 5
primary focus (e.g., Gokhale, 1995; Johnson & Johnson,
1986; Montagu, 1966; Totten, Sills, Digby, & Russ, 1991).
Similarly, open and honest communication between mentors
and mentees has been demonstrated to be of utmost impor-
tance in order that guidance be appropriate to an individual's
overall career vision (e.g., Patterson-Stewart, Ritchie, &
Sanders, 1997). Given the intensity of time, energy, and
resource commitment involved in the pursuit of the PhD and
a career within the academy, good mentoring is usually a
long-term collaboration and must be predicated on shared
communication and understandings.
Best lessons learned and dispensed from our collective
mentoring have been within the context of cross- and inter-
generational efforts of a "critical community." The concept
of "critical community" refers to a collective of individuals
similarly dedicated to providing honest structured guidance
and supporting opportunities to enhance their individual cul-
tural capital to sustain and expand all members for their
future careers (Dodson et al., 2009; Garrison &Archer, 2000;
Thomas, Willis, & Davis, 2007). This attention to personal-
ized mentoring as part of a critical collective allows each
member to understand himself or herself as a humane profes-
sional, responsible for engaging with and contributing to
their career community as well as to the local, national, and,
eventually, international environments in which he or she
will work. Some of the mentoring roles that emerge as part of
one's membership in such a critical community are those of
"confronter, clarifier, comforter and collaborator" as these
persons are committed to be there if and as called on (L.
Thomas, personal communication, April 4, 2014). These role
labels, although not exhaustive, do capture the nature of how
effective mentors function. Mentors will shift in and between
these roles as the mentee grows and develops. The constant
is the presence of and commitment to a critical community
that will permeate almost all phases of a successful career. To
learn how to function in such a collective is an indispensable
need that is particularly significant for individuals whose
cultural communities have been historically excluded from
higher education and the U.S. academy (Davidson & Foster-
Johnson, 2001; Dodson et al., 2009).
We have identified four distinct phases and specific activ-
ities that are associated with mentoring toward successful
academic careers: pre-career, early career, mid-career, and
full or senior professional years. We single out mentoring
lessons associated with these divisions and devote this por-
tion of the article to elucidating aspects of those phases. Even
before a full mentoring relationship is established, mentee
and mentor--together or separately--must discern the men-
tee's current phase. This can more effectively allow the inte-
gration of mentoring components.
Pre-Career Phase
Undergraduate years. Undergraduate years are not often con-
sidered part of graduate and/or junior faculty mentoring.
However, graduate students and junior faculty come from
the ranks of undergraduate students. More important, it is
students of the baccalaureate who need exposure to larger
views of higher education than their particular curricula usu-
ally offer. They also need an understanding that higher edu-
cation--the academy--is intimately connected to the
successful functioning of society. Such comprehension can
better help students envision possibilities of a career in intel-
lectual leadership.
Currently, our society is giving strong recognition to ben-
efits of practicum, hands-on, experiential, or research-based
experiences at this undergraduate phase (Russell, Hancock,
& McCullough, 2007; Tai, Liu, Maltese, & Fan, 2006).
Academic advisors in such support programs have the poten-
tial to serve as future mentors for students but that character
of the relationships is not automatic and perhaps rarely
equals the intensive mentoring investment these authors are
advocating. Nevertheless, support program advisors can be
helpful to undergraduate students in identifying outlines of
professional networks and alerting them to the need for self-
care as an intricate part of graduate education and an even-
tual sustainable career that is "respectful of the whole person"
(Miller & Garcia, 2004, p. 197). Too often unaddressed self-
care sensitivities can derail professional relationships
(Ramirez, 2012).
Graduate years.At this phase of pre-career development,
mentoring intensifies as mentees have identified that they
wish to pursue a path that leads to professional functioning in
the variety of knowledge-production careers. Students
actively engage in learning the crafts of comprehensive read-
ing, professional writing, design and data analysis of
research, and dissemination. They also should be exposed to
a higher level of professional structures even as they are
meeting requirements of their curriculum. Strong mentoring
is responsible to ensure that students are acquiring the high-
est levels of skills mastery in each of these categories.
It is in the graduate years that students need to refine their
ability to function as conscious professionals who perform
effectively within arenas of the career to which they aspire.
Mentors are critical in this endeavor as they should be iden-
tifying professional events and activities in which mentees
can participate. Mentors also should allow mentees to
accompany them to professional gatherings and introduce
the emerging professionals to members of the gatherings.
Often, this means that mentors assist in finding travel sup-
port funds for graduate students to attend the events. Such
efforts allow mentees to actually participate in activities of
professional arenas and support their academic and social
acculturation to support their progression toward successful
careers (Dodson et al., 2009; Ramirez, 2012; Thomas et al.,
2007).
Equally important is that these years provide graduate stu-
dents with opportunities to help socialize younger individu-
als to the demands of the career arenas (Dodson et al., 2009;
Gasman et al., 2008; Patterson-Stewart et al., 1997). This is
where the critical community of cross generations, diverse
6 SAGE Open
cultures, and diverse genders is significant. By engaging in
peer advising and mentoring, students have an opportunity to
observe and participate in clarifying the taken-for-granted,
unspoken yet normative behaviors of professional responsi-
bilities. This directly relates to arenas where many women
and members of racial ethnic cultural communities have not
been exposed. In fact, primarily White institutions are in
great need of enhanced and culturally sensitive mentoring for
students of color, particularly underserved African American
women in these contexts (Grant & Simmons, 2008; Johnson-
Bailey, 2004). For most graduate students of color attending
such institutions, the focus is on promoting their assimilation
into a predominantly White environment rather than promot-
ing an environment that recognizes the cultures and contri-
butions of all participants, or promoting "authentic cultural
pluralism" (Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001, p. 554).
Mentoring for students of color is likely to benefit from
engaging collectivist perspectives (e.g., Blue, 2001;
Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; McGee, Saran, &
Krulwich, 2012; J. L. Smith et al., 2014), which align more
with these students' cultures of origin. In this regard, a criti-
cal community, such as our mentoring collective, can help to
reinforce students' maintaining the cultural integrity of their
background while prioritizing professional responsibilities.
This is important and differs from the individual and short-
term gains to which much of higher education currently
socializes graduate students.
Early Career Phase: Post-Doctoral and Pre-Tenure
Years
The early career phase of an individual's educational and
learning life can be initiated by post-doctoral years and may
extend into pre-tenure and/or years equivalent to those of
junior faculty. We argue that a post-doctoral experience,
most immediately after the award of the PhD, is vital for
grounding an effective and sustainable career, regardless of
one's disciplinary focus. The post-doctorate affords the new
PhD an opportunity to recover from the total fatigue of com-
pleting a graduate program and a dissertation. During this
early career phase, mentors should be assisting their mentees
in entering more deeply into professional arenas as well as
helping them to assess and/or redesign career objectives and
goals based on post-doctorate experiences.
We frame this guided period of professional maturation as
a time for an individual to gain cognition, that is "knowing
what they know" about their competence as a producer of
knowledge and consciously identifying strategies to navigate
macro- and micro-level career environments (Griffin, Muniz,
& Espinosa, 2012). Individuals from U.S. domestic popula-
tions underrepresented in higher education and women are
especially in need of mentoring during the early career
phase. Mentors must assist in expanding socialization oppor-
tunities, and/or help assess expanded socialization experi-
ences. For example, mentors will need to help early career
persons identify and learn to respond to encounters with
micro aggressions that pervade professional lives of racial
ethnic persons and women. These are the verbal, behavioral,
and/or environmental affronts against people of color and
women who are rarely deemed strong or visible enough to
demand immediate responses (Constantine, Smith,
Redington, & Owens, 2008; Hess, Gault, & Yi, 2013;
Pittman, 2012; W. A. Smith, Hung, & Franklin, 2011).
Mentors must help early career individuals learn how to rec-
ognize such actions, how to identify allies, and how to enact
strategies to sustain their sense of effective and competent
cultural self while continuing on a designated career trajec-
tory (e.g., Williams, 2001). Productive strategies that have
been suggested include the creation of "alternative microcli-
mates" (p. 84), or "safe spaces" that provide environments
where support, collegiality, and validation may be found
within otherwise hostile environments (Ackelsberg, Hart,
Miller, Queeney, & Van Dyne, 2009).
Mid-Career Phase: Immediate Post-Tenure Years
The mid-career professorship years are distinguished by
mentees bringing together job with career vision while con-
tinuing to expand knowledge-production foundations.
Generally, the expansion occurs after one attains specific
objectives toward goals of their vision. In an academic arena,
this expansion usually occurs after tenure has been firmly
established. The development can also occur in a multitude
of arenas and through distinct participation in professional
communities of a disciplinary field, through completion of a
range of publications that reflect a selected expertise, by the
mentoring of curriculum-based students and/or post-doctoral
researchers, and through expansion of professional contacts
and networks. It is through accomplishments in these areas at
the mid-career level that an individual is able to continue
expanding his or her influence at the institutional, national,
and international levels.
Particular challenges can arise for women and faculty of
color during the mid-career phase because of increasing
requests and/or demands on time for service activities and
increasing requests to mentor junior colleagues of color and
women (Baldwin, DeZure, Shaw, & Moretto, 2008;
Rockquemore, 2011; Wheeler & Wheeler, 1994). Therefore,
whereas mid-career faculty are guiding mentees, they simul-
taneously remain in need of mentoring to help them success-
fully approach continued and new challenges (Canale,
Herdklotz, & Wild, 2013; Rockquemore, 2011). Whereas
formal programs for mentoring of mid-career faculty con-
tinue to emerge, specific attention to the needs of women and
faculty of color at the mid-career phase lag far behind such
developments (Baldwin & Chang, 2006; Baldwin et al.,
2008).
During this phase, mentors should guide mentees to seek
opportunities to serve on editorial boards of various national
and international publications and to serve with governing
Montgomery et al. 7
committees of professional organizations, accrediting units,
and other committees to which they are active and contribut-
ing members. Beyond advancing their own career, such ser-
vice activities are important for identifying places where
mid-career persons can insert mentees and students. Equally
important is that these service activities help to establish the
reputation of the mid-career person.
Senior Career Phase: Full Professional Years
When arriving at this phase of senior professional, an indi-
vidual should have assumed the beginnings of a leadership
role in his or her chosen arenas and/or research fields. Such a
position should be national and international in scope with a
full range of memberships in specialty professional organi-
zations. The leadership positions may include but are not
limited to membership and/or directorship on editorial
boards of journals and/or book series; membership in the
nuclei relationships that guide professional associations and/
or societies; being regularly called on to assess graduate
writing, professional promotions, and personnel hiring;
being invited to make key-note presentations; being selected
to conduct program/departmental accreditation reviews;
leading the organizing of specialized professional gatherings
and publications; and many other such activities.
We see this phase as one where the individual stands well
positioned to challenge these same professional spaces to be
more inclusive and reflective of populations and social issues
historically excluded from U.S. higher education (e.g.,
Foreman, 2013). This is not necessarily how many research-
ers, scholars, or other accomplished professionals contempo-
rarily envision their responsibility, in positions as they are
developing their career or as a senior scholar. Too often, such
persons, particularly those who are part of an academic
departmental faculty at U.S. colleges and universities, are
focused and advised to focus on advancing their individual
careers to achieve promotion. The aspiration for promotion,
with its specific processes and tasks cannot be denied, but if
everyone is myopically concerned with securing positions
and status as individuals, we are not truly fulfilling our col-
lective and individual responsibility to our democratic soci-
ety (Pitre, 2008).
These authors have learned that a significant goal and
important career responsibility of all who serve in research,
scholarship, and/or other professional roles are that they/we
are mandated to contribute to the improvement of our society
and all humankind. The ability to sustain and succeed in this
responsibility is definitely built on an individual's move into
increasingly secure employment positions. However, the
larger, overall goal is not merely individual success but the
inclusive improvement of our democratic society and assist-
ing in enhancing the quality of life for human beings as we
participate in our ecological environment.
We also have learned that senior professionals have an
added obligation to help insert their cadre of student and
junior faculty mentees, into integrated pathways that lead to
their chosen professional arena(s). The importance of this
critical role of senior faculty in introducing mentees to mem-
bers of their professional networks and key academic and
professional opportunities has been noted by others (Ramirez,
2012). Successful implementation of this role responsibility
leads back to our earlier propositional stance that a prerequi-
site for strong mentoring is full knowledge of mentees.
Mentors who have achieved senior status and have knowl-
edge about their mentees will be well informed of a mentee's
chosen professional arena(s). It also is here that a functioning
critical community allows each member to help identify and
share supportive materials and opportunities for other mem-
bers at their particular phase of growth and development.
The need for such a community has been referred to by oth-
ers as "alternative microclimates" (Ackelsberg et al., 2009),
supportive or functional "relationship constellations"
(Thomas et al., 2007), or "collectivism mentoring" (Davidson
& Foster-Johnson, 2001). Such communities have been pur-
ported to align more with the cultures of mentees of color, as
opposed to the prevailing approach by many senior scholars
of mentoring and cultivation of individuals who largely mir-
ror the mentor (i.e., homosocial reproduction) in academia
(Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; Thomas et al., 2007).
We do not assume that senior status allows a professional,
researcher, and/or scholar to cease their development. Even
in the senior phase, an individual must continue contributing
to knowledge production in his or her professional areas.
Each individual must continue designing fundable research
projects, conducting investigations, analyzing and publish-
ing from their investigations, and presenting findings in pro-
fessional contexts of significant others. An implication of
such activities in this phase of a career should mean that
seniors help expand their professional arenas and ensure that
standards for bringing in aspiring new professionals do not
lapse into the return of prior inequalities. The senior phase of
mentoring work includes serving as critical advocates for
junior and mid-career professionals as they progress through
their respective phases.
Finally, given the political nature of knowledge produc-
tion and dissemination, we strongly recommend that scholars
with such seniority identify a reliable and accessible location
for depositing their professional papers, data, other research,
and accomplishments, including specific instructions for its
entire usage. The choice should be one that ensures the mate-
rials will be processed quickly, made available for research
scholars, and does not impose restrictive fees for use of the
materials. This can help ensure that the materials are effec-
tively preserved and accessible to future generations.
Perspectives on the Way Forward
There is a growing recognition of the need for scholars, par-
ticularly of color, to contribute to efficacious mentoring to
support junior scholars in building and sustaining thriving
8 SAGE Open
careers inclusive of overall personal and professional well-
being (e.g., Rivera Maulucci & Mensah, 2013). Important
for mentoring junior scholars is modeling the close connec-
tion that some faculty maintain between their personally
developed identities as part of their cultural grounding and
their intellectual lives (Moore, Shinew, Sternod, Merk, &
Saul, 2013), as the perceived inability to have such connec-
tions is an impediment to some students selecting to pursue
careers in knowledge production (Austin, 2002; A. Smith,
2013). Our integrative review of the literature and mentoring
experiences suggest that it is possible to implement a process
that allows students and junior faculty of color, as well as
women, to understand and prepare for the many challenges
and opportunities that come with a professional academic
career. Such processes require significant input of time,
effort, and commitment on the part of mentees and mentors.
However, when viewed as a collaborative effort, such inten-
sive processes can be successful and add value to the experi-
ence of each participant.The success and value are manifested
in the traditional sense of productivity and in the non-
traditional sense of enrichment to the life of all parties
involved in the mentoring exchange.
There are environmental factors that affect the potential
efficacy of such mentoring of developing scholars of color
and women. Potential mentors of like backgrounds with
these young scholars and women remain low in number; for
example, the number of African American women faculty
and instructors has remained virtually unchanged since at
least 2007 (U.S. Department of Education, National Center
for Education Statistics, 2012). In addition, some colleges
and universities continue to maintain cultures and/or envi-
ronments that, although "legally" open to all students, persist
in maintaining closed doors that actively impede participa-
tion of people of color and women (Ellis, 2001, p. 42). These
and other factors suggest an urgent need to reform environ-
ments into ones that support effective faculty mentoring and
reward the efforts of strong, efficacious mentors (Gasman
et al., 2008; Shavers & Moore, 2014; Turner & Thompson,
1993; Whittaker & Montgomery, 2014).
We have outlined some effective mentoring practices
based on the literature and our collective personal experi-
ences. One such effective model includes mentoring in criti-
cal collective communities. Such a collective approach
draws on the combined strengths of the participating indi-
viduals; mitigates the prevalent isolation of students and fac-
ulty of color, especially African American women; and can
provide some relief to the problem of limited access to men-
tors. Such arrangements promote beneficial peer interac-
tions, and address the need for an environment wherein the
cultural foundations of students and junior faculty are inte-
grated in the mentoring process. All of these are identifiable
as factors contributing to or detracting from the success of
the aforementioned populations (Ackelsberg et al., 2009;
Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; Dodson et al., 2009;
Ellis, 2001; Gasman et al., 2008; Johnson-Bailey, 2004;
Johnson-Bailey et al., 2009; King & Chepyator-Thomson,
1996; Patterson-Stewart et al., 1997; J. L. Smith et al., 2014;
Thomas et al., 2007).
