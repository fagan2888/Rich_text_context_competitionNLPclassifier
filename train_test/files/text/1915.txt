HAVING relied upon spousal support and companion-
ship throughout adulthood, older adults who are wid-
owed often experience pivotal changes in social and
economic support arrangements. Widowhood transitions
are particularly consequential and fraught with risk where
pension and social welfare systems are weakly developed
and older adults are primarily dependent upon children to
provide instrumental, emotional, and economic support.
One such context is China, a country that will experience
a dramatic rise in its elderly population, consequently cre-
ating multitudes of widows and widowers in the process
(Kinsella & Velkoff, 2001; Poston & Duan, 2000). In addi-
tion to the declines in social support and economic resources
that widows and widowers may encounter, widowhood has
been associated with heightened risks of morbidity and mor-
tality, a pattern observed in Hong Kong, mainland China, and
elsewhere (Ho, 1991; Q. Li, 2005; Poston & Min, 2008). As
such, parent­child coresidence support traditions appear to
be particularly important at this point in the life course. Some
scholars find that depression among bereaving widows and
widowers in China is buffered by socially supportive adult
children (L. Li, Liang, Toler, & Gu, 2005). And recent analy-
ses find that household and emotional support, especially
when delivered by coresident and proximate children, lessen
mortality risks among rural elderly Chinese, suggesting that
intergenerational coresidence may be protective of older well-
being in widowhood (W. Zhang, Li, & Silverstein, 2005).
A range of studies have examined marital status as a
static independent variable in cross-sectional analyses of
older adult living arrangements (e.g., Cooney & Shi, 1999;
Stinner, Xu, & Wei, 1992; Q. F. Zhang, 2004). Far fewer
have utilized longitudinal approaches to consider how tran-
sitions into widowhood affect adaptations in living arrange-
ments. Moreover, although past studies have deliberated
upon the endurance of child coresidence in the context of
changing demographics, the fates of vulnerable subsets of
China's elderly population, including widows and widow-
ers, have not been sufficiently addressed. The current study
assumes that adjustments in coresidence are shaped by wid-
owhood transitions in conjunction with other characteris-
tics, such as gender, health, social status, and structures of
familial networks. We draw upon the Chinese Longitudinal
Healthy Longevity Surveys (CLHLSs), 1998­2005, to pro-
vide a dynamic analysis examining whether the onset of
widowhood triggers shifts in intergenerational coresidence.
Long extolled as the upmost virtue in Chinese society,
filial piety is thought to be expressed most clearly in adult
children's provision of care to their elderly parents (Ikels,
1993). First and foremost, young people are expected to
take care of their aging parents, an expectation commonly

Objectives. Transitions from marriage to widowhood are consequential and fraught with risk in developing country
contexts. We investigate whether transitions to widowhood, as well as transitions to worsened functional health, predict
transition into coresidential living arrangements with children in a rapidly aging China. We also inquire whether coresi-
dence transitions vary by older adults' gender and the presence of grandchildren in skip generation households.
Methods. Longitudinal prospective analyses of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Surveys (1998­2005)
assess whether transition to widowhood and transition to relatively poor functional health influence elderly coresidence
with children. Several logistic regression models are estimated using robust standard error estimation to address data
clustering at the person level.
Results. When coresidence shifts occur, they are shaped by the needs of older adults. Specifically, a significant rise in
coresidential living follows widowhood as well as deterioration in functional health. Among older adults coresiding with
grandchildren, shifts to coresidence with own children following widowhood and worsened functional health are attenu-
ated, suggesting that skip generation households may be supportive arrangements for older adults.
Discussion. Results are interpreted in light of the adaptability of living arrangements, novel forms such as skip gen-
eration households, and intergenerational support for China's elderly population.

accomplished through coresidential living (L. Li et al., 2005).
Much research has shown that obligations to older adults
remain pervasive, guiding values among Chinese, and that
these values are, in many instances, reinforced by the Chinese
communist state (Chen & Silverstein, 2000; Davis & Harrell,
1993; Logan & Bian, 2003;Whyte, 2003a; Q. F. Zhang, 2004).
The strong value placed on filial piety in Chinese society, espe-
cially the emphasis on demonstrating loyalty and support to
parents over and above the service of one's own needs, is con-
sistent with a family altruism orientation to intergenerational
support and specifically to a coresidence transition when an
elder parent is widowed or otherwise experiences heightened
need (Hermalin, 2002; Zimmer & Kwong, 2003).
As in much of the Asian-Pacific region, population aging is
proceeding at a rapid pace in China, and as a result, sizable
segments of the population will encounter widowhood in the
coming decades (Zeng & George, 1999). In addition, increas-
ing longevity and the one-child policy are resulting in a
so-called "4-2-1" situation, that is, family structures consisting
of four older grandparents, two adult children, and one younger
grandchild (Jiang, 1995; Kaneda, 2006). Although not nearly
descriptive of China's family structural diversity under the
one-child policy, the tendency toward this structure predicts
that large numbers of older adults will rely on support from
relatively small numbers of adult children and grandchildren.
This raises questions as to the durability of families in
fulfilling elderly support needs and the potential demand for
alternative forms of assistance in coming decades. Al-
though the welfare of parents has long been considered to
be a primary concern of adult children, emerging demo-
graphic realities threaten to strain these deeply entrenched
filial obligations. Voices from academic and policy circles
have raised concerns that changes in Chinese society, in-
cluding rapid declines in fertility, and changing attitudes,
consumption behaviors, and living arrangements associated
with marked urbanization and globalization will lead to iso-
lation and abandonment of older adults by children whose
filial piety is diminished (D. Gu, Dupre, & Liu, 2007; Zhan,
Liu, & Bai, 2006). Correspondingly, some studies have doc-
umented a secular decline in parent­child coresidence in
China in recent decades (Xin & Chuliang, 2008).
Anticipated growth of the widowed population in China
places these concerns about weakened intergenerational
support and rising caregiving burdens into sharp relief. If
coresidence is a reliable form of intergenerational support
in China, it should emerge most visibly in contexts
when older adults become more vulnerable and less self-
sufficient, such as when functional health worsens, when
widowhood leaves an older adult alone and bereaving, and
especially when these marital and health transitions over-
lap.An examination of the period following spousal death is
critical for deciphering whether child coresidence remains a
viable form of elderly support as it is at this point that we
expect parental need to be great, filial children to be respon-
sive, and living arrangements to change accordingly.
A "family altruism" framework has been articulated and
empirically supported in previous analyses that find that in-
tergenerational support receipt is predicted by certain
"markers of dependency," such as physical disabilities and
health problems (Frankenberg, Lillard, & Willis, 2002;
Logan & Bian, 2003). The onset of widowhood and poor
health is among the times in which supportive ties, such as
those expressed by movement into a coresidential arrange-
ment, are likely to be activated (Frankenberg et al., 2002).
Recent research by Zimmer (2005, 2008) indicates that
functional limitations, as markers of dependency, are asso-
ciated with living arrangement transitions, with transitions
more likely to follow for women and those not married. The
current analyses further explore late-life coresidence transi-
tions, expanding the time frame of analysis and highlighting
the transition to widowhood as it alters dependency and
influences shifts in coresidence arrangements.
Moreover, the analysis considers that transitions in co
residence in response to widowhood in China are likely to
vary across several other dimensions. One is gender. Older
females are more likely to be reliant upon the economic re-
sources of spouses and to experience financial instability
when their spouses die (S. Gu & Liang, 2000; L. Li et al.,
2005). Still, men's networks of support, in particular ties to
children, are thought to be fostered by the kin-keeping roles
fulfilled by their wives (Kalmijn, 2007;Yount, 2005). Thus,
older men's kinship ties may be rendered more tenuous
when a wife dies. It is estimated that within the next 20­30
years, approximately one quarter of Chinese women will be
elderly. Gender-differentiated health, education, and labor
market outcomes in China suggest that this elderly female
population will be disproportionately widowed, poorly edu-
cated, and financially insecure as compared with their male
counterparts (Liu, 2004; Poston & Min, 2008).
Another key dimension is the structure of an older adult's
household. Because ensuring the well-being of the older
generation is a fundamental priority under family altruism,
the presence and availability of other potential family care-
givers need to be considered. A particularly important com-
ponent that has received limited attention in past literature
is the presence or absence of grandchildren. The expression
of filial piety is not limited to acts toward one's parents but
rather extends across multiple generations. Under such val-
ues and where family economies are increasingly dispersed
across space through labor migration, one might expect
grandchildren to be coresiding with grandparents in order to
meet support needs. Yet much past literature has cast the
"skip generation household" as one in which grandparents
serve as caregivers in the wake of absent migrant parents.
However, especially in the case of the very old, grandchil-
dren may themselves be old enough to act as caregivers and
thus may substitute for older adults' own children in this
capacity (Zeng & George, 2000). Given the increased labor
migration occurring out of rural areas and small cities, the
skip generation household, that is, a household with older

adults and grandchildren but no middle generation, may
evolve as a living situation that offers various forms of infor-
mal support to older adults in lieu of child coresidence. In this
sense, the skip generation household may be one that buffers
the effect of widowhood, and other shifts in need, on living
arrangement transitions. Thus, grown children may provide
support to their aged parents indirectly, through extended
family relations, by assuring that daily care and companion-
ship are provided to parents in need by their own children.
In rural China, the coresidence of older adults with grown
children is often a stable status, rooted in cultural expecta-
tions of filial piety as well as social and economic interde-
pendence across generations. Yet, not all coreside with
children. Our perspective on the Chinese extended family
and family altruism leads us to formulate several hypothe-
ses on older adult living arrangement transitions. For those
who have lived apart, we hypothesize that older adults will
be most likely to enter into coresidential arrangements with
adult children when their circumstances are reflective of
need for support. Deteriorating functional health, the ab-
sence of other kin relations in the household, and most im-
portantly for the current analysis--becoming a widow or
widower--are the conditions or events that our study exam-
ines as indicators of relative need and dependence upon as-
sistance. Widowhood, when accompanied by poor or
declining health, suggests a situation of great parental de-
mand for assistance, implying that coresidential living with
a child is practically a necessity (see also Ikels, 1993,
p. 318). Alternatively, grown grandchildren may be able to
assist in meeting the needs of older adults. Thus, per the
context of household structure discussed earlier, we further
hypothesize that the tendency to shift into coresidence with
children will be lessened for those older adults experiencing
heightened need but already coresiding with grandchildren in
skip generation households. Finally, given the gendered
quality of kin relations in China, we expect that elderly
women will experience relatively greater odds of transition to
child coresidence when faced with widowhood or functional
health decline as compared with their male counterparts.
Methods
We analyze data from the CLHLS, which began in 1998
with a sample of about 9,000 individuals aged 80 years and
older. Follow-up interviews were conducted in 2000, 2002,
and 2005. Follow-ups included reinterviews of the baseline
sample plus add-ons to account for attrition. The sample
comes from 22 Han ethnicity­dominated provinces where
half of the counties were randomly selected as part of the
sample. This results in an extensive sample covering 80% of
China's total population (Zeng & Gu, 2008). Beginning in
2002, and again in 2005, data collection was expanded to
include those aged 65­79 years in addition to the ongoing
panel of oldest old. The current study uses the entire longi-
tudinal sample, including those aged 80 years and older
from 1998 on and those aged 65­79 years from 2002 on.
That 65­79 year olds were included in only two of the four
CLHLS waves under consideration results in a sample age
distribution that is nonrepresentative. It should also be noted
that the CLHLS oversampled male oldest old, nonagenari-
ans, and centenarians, further shaping the age distribution
of the analytic sample. Neither of these sampling particu-
larities influence the results of multivariate analyses that
adjust for age.
Besides allowing us to analyze a large probability sample
of older adults in China, the CLHLS has features that are
well suited to the questions at hand. First, the longitudinal
nature of the data provides a framework whereby reinter-
views allow for measurement of changes in marital status
and functional health and for linking these changes across
time with transitions in residential arrangements across the
same points in time. Second, the CLHLS systematically uti-
lizes child and household rosters across waves of data collec-
tion, allowing delineation of numbers of living children as
well as numbers and types of resident kin (e.g., grandchildren)
whose presence may either encourage or lessen child coresi-
dence. Third, measures of activities of daily living (ADLs)
allow for the linking of disability with transitions in living
arrangements in the context of changes in marital status.
In order to measure changes in child coresidence, we
treat each segment of time between successive waves as an
observation period and prepare a stacked data set. The
method of reinterview means that older adults may have up
to three person-interval records in the stacked data set, gen-
erating a total of 15,039 person-intervals. Although exten-
sive clustering at the individual level does at times warrant
multilevel models to address error structure in the data, the
CLHLS data does not result in such a situation. In fact,
the average number of intervals respondents contributed to
the data was 1.7, with the mean number of survey intervals
being almost identical for male and female respondents.
This indicates only a moderate degree of nesting, with
many respondents (62%) contributing only one interval of
observation. Given this, a multilevel approach is not only
unnecessary but also untenable, and we instead treat our
question of residential shifting using a logistic regression
model with robust standard error estimation to account for
clustering at the individual level. Such an approach is well
suited to the data and its error structure and offers a straight-
forward means to address the contribution of multiple ob-
servations by a minority of respondents. When presenting
descriptive statistics (Table 1), we use individuals as the
analysis unit, rather than person-intervals, to reflect the
sample of 9,650 older adults who appear in the CLHLS and,
in our analysis, for at least two consecutive waves.
Coresidence with a child is the outcome of interest, and
given the age of the sample, in all cases this means coresi-
dence with an adult offspring. Coresidence is constructed as
a dichotomous variable by referring to the household roster
in each CLHLS wave. Among older adults who were non
INTERGENERATIONAL CORESIDENCE AMONG CHINA'S ELDERLY POPULATION 263
coresident at baseline, we assess whether they did coreside
with a child (or children) by follow-up. By accounting for
coresidence at baseline, we are modeling a "transition" in
coresidence.
Our focal independent variable is a dynamic measure of
marital status. As can be seen in Table 1, widowhood is a
prevalent status among older adults surveyed in the CL-
HLS, and it is a status that is especially prevalent among

females and the oldest old. As we are interested in marital
status transitions as events that evoke change and poten-
tially risk, we compare marital status at baseline and again
at follow-up and define marital status transitions as follows:
(a) married at follow-up (reference category), (b) married at
baseline and widowed at follow-up, and (c) widowed at
baseline and follow-up.
Our secondary independent variable, assessed at baseline
and subsequently, is a dummy variable indicating whether
the respondent experienced functional health decline. Spe-
cifically, for baseline and follow-up, we construct a score,
ranging from 0 to 12, to indicate the number of ADLs with
which the older adult reports experiencing difficulty and the
severity of that difficulty (Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson,
& Jaffee, 1963). ADLs are specific tasks necessary for the
maintenance of independence. The six ADLs considered
here are bathing, dressing, toileting, getting out of bed, con-
tinence, and feeding oneself. Specifically, for each ADL, if
the respondent reports no difficulty, a score of zero is as-
signed; if some difficulty is reported, a score of one is as-
signed; and if the respondent reports difficulty so great as to
require assistance of another person or device, a score of
two is assigned. These scores are summed. Respondents
with high scores are seen as being relatively dependent
upon others for handling one's own day-to-day functioning
and self-care. We assess functional health decline in those
respondents who have a higher ADL score at follow-up than
they had at baseline.
The test of our hypotheses about child coresidence re-
sponsiveness hinges on observed changes to living arrange-
ments that accompany transitions from married to widowed
as well as shifts from positive to poor functional health and
whether relatively debilitating outcomes (i.e., the experi-
ence of widowhood and the increase in functional health
limitations) emerging jointly incrementally increase the
odds of transitioning to coresidence with an adult child.
Our multivariate analyses consider a series of additional
covariates pertinent to elderly living arrangements. As the
presence of other kin is likely to influence the propensity of
older adults to coreside with children, we use the household
roster to derive a measure of grandchildren in the household
at baseline. As elaborated earlier, the grandchildren in ques-
tion are rarely children, given the age of the respondents
and their own childbearing patterns as well as those of their
children. Rather, of grandkids residing in respondents'
households without own children coresident (i.e., skip gen-
eration households), fewer than 12% are under the age of 15
years, and their mean age is 34 years. Although skip gen-
eration households, consisting of grandchildren, older
adults, and no middle generation, are small in number, we
focus on this household form as it is likely an important
emerging living situation in China.
Control variables in the models include the number of
living sons and daughters at baseline, the older adult's age
(measured categorically so as to capture nonlinear associa-
tions), highest educational attainment, main occupation
prior to age 60 years, and geographic location of residence
(i.e., whether rural village, town, or city). Finally, we incor-
porate the older adult's gender into the models to assess
whether coresidence shifting diverges for men and women.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the analytical
sample. Note that we present baseline characteristics for
those individuals who appeared in at least two consecutive
waves of the CLHLS (N = 9,650). Highlighting marital sta-
tus and marital status transitions, nearly 40% were married
at baseline (i.e., the first time they entered the sample). De-
spite the relatively small window of time that we use to as-
sess transitions (i.e., 2­3 years), we observe over 7% of
married adults at baseline becoming widowed by follow-up
(N = 688). Functional health also fluctuates across survey
waves, with greater than 20% of individuals in the analyti-
cal sample experiencing declining ability to perform ADLs
at follow-up (N = 2,025). The upcoming analysis addresses
whether these transitions contribute to significant rear-
rangement of older adults' residential situations with re-
spect to child coresidence.
We provide transition matrices for parent­child coresi-
dence situations in Table 2, panels A through C. Each tran-
sition matrix also considers changes in the coresidence
status of grandchildren. Specifically, the first row of each
matrix establishes whether at least one child coresides at
baseline, and subsequent child coresidence status at follow-
up. The latter two rows establish whether a grandchild, or
neither child nor grandchild, resides in the household at
baseline and whether these arrangements prevail at follow-
up. We delineate living arrangement status transitions for all
surviving older adults in the sample (panel A) and then for
the subsets of older adults who experienced a shift to wid-
owhood (panel B) or a worsening of functional health situ-
ation (panel C). As compared with Table 1, here the unit of
analysis is not individuals but person-intervals. Each re-
spondent may contribute up to three intervals, but the aver-
age for the analytical sample is 1.7.
A brief inspection of Table 2 panel A indicates that co
residence with one's own child(ren) is a relatively stable
status. Yet, both transitions into and out of coresidence oc-
cur on a quite frequent basis. For instance, of the approxi-
mately 62% of older adults coresiding with a child at
baseline, about 83% of those were also coresiding at
follow-up. The balance either resided with a grandchild
only or without a grandchild or child. For those not residing
with a child at baseline, most do not have a grandchild
present either. In the 32% of older adults in this situation,
over 25% live with a child by follow-up. Approximately
6% of older adults were living without a child but with a
grandchild present at baseline. Not only relatively uncom-
mon, this latter arrangement is relatively unstable; between
INTERGENERATIONAL CORESIDENCE AMONG CHINA'S ELDERLY POPULATION 265
30 and 40% of such older adults are coresiding with a child
by follow-up.
Inspecting panel B, which represents the living arrange-
ment transitions of older adults who experience widowhood
between survey intervals, we see that for those without a
child present at baseline (52.6%), a far more sizable share
transitioned to coresidence over the interval (84.1%) than
was the case for the full sample (only 57.4% in the analyti-
cal sample overall experienced such a shift). Recent widow-
hood, too, is associated with greater movement out of
coresidence situations that involved a grandchild but no
own child.
Panel C, which considers changes for those experiencing
functional health declines, indicates that older adults in this
category are least likely to transition out of child coresident
arrangements across survey intervals. Specifically, about
86% living with a child at baseline and who experience a
deterioration of functional health remain coresident. Of
those co-residing with just a grandchild but no child, func-
tional health deterioration appears to increase the likelihood
of remaining in such a state rather that transitioning to a
situation in which no grandchild or no child coresides.
In Table 3, we model living arrangement transitions by
assessing predictors of a change to child coresidence for
older adults who, at baseline, were not coresiding with a
child. Model 1 results are consistent with our hypotheses
regarding transitions reacting to parental need. Specifically,
older adults who have recently been widowed are substan-
tially and significantly more likely (odds ratio [OR] = 3.69)
than those who remain married to enter into a coresidence
situation by the end of the survey interval. The OR for those
remaining widowed (OR = 1.93) suggests an increasing
likelihood of adopting a coresidential living arrangement
with at least one adult child with the passage of time as a
widow or widower.
Results also indicate that older adults in China are more
likely to enter into a coresidential living arrangement with a
child if they have recently experienced a decline in their
functional health status (OR = 1.49). This is attributed to the
positive and significant association between shifts to cores-
idence and rise in the disability status score within the sur-
vey interval, controlling for the disability status score at
baseline. This pattern is consistent with our overarching
theoretical perspective as greater limitations faced in han-
dling tasks of daily living represent an entrance into greater
physical dependency and thus greater need for support.
Additional variables in the models warrant mentioning as
they illustrate the set of social and demographic factors as-
sociated with transition into coresidential living with adult
children. First, and contrary to expectation, we do not find
gender to be a significant factor in transition to intergenera-
tional coresidence. However, additional analyses indicate
that the relationship between gender and coresidence transi-
tion is moderated by the high correlation between gender
and marital status, specifically women's greater likelihood
of being widowed between baseline and follow-up. Place of
residence is significant, with older adults in urban areas
(i.e., cities and towns) being significantly less likely than
their rural counterparts to enter coresidence arrangements.
These latter results are consistent with a picture of move-
ment away from coresidence traditions among populations
in relatively modernized regions of the country. Finally, we
find that main occupation prior to age 60 years is not a sig-
nificant predictor of coresidence transitions.
By adding interactions, Models 2 and 3 further assess the
effects of becoming widowed, worsening functional health,
and the presence of grandchildren on shifts in coresidence.
The interactions are significant, and the model goodness of fit
improves, indicating that the effects of being or becoming
widowed and ADLs are conditional on grandchild presence.

First, examining marital status by grandchild presence, the
contrast category is the case of a continuously married re-
spondent with no coresident grandchild. All other situations
increase the ORs. For instance, when one remains married,
the probability of shifting to a coresidential situation in-
creases (OR = 2.09) with the presence of a grandchild.
When a grandchild is not present, marital statuses other
than continuously married increase the probability of shifts
into coresidence. The OR is particularly robust for those
whose status changes from married to widow. The most no-
table effect of the interactions in Model 2 is to signify that
when there is a change in marital status from married to
widowed, the presence of a grandchild decreases the OR of
a shift into coresidence from 3.96 (main effect) to 3.31 (the
product two main effects and the interaction effect). Thus,
although becoming widowed greatly increases the probabil-
ity of moving to a coresidential situation, grandchild pres-
ence influences the magnitude of this probability.
Second, looking at ADL limitations in Model 3, the im-
portance of grandchild presence is again important in deter-
mining the impact on a change in coresidence. Specifically,
when no grandchild is present, an increase in ADL limita-
tions during the interval increases the probability of a
change. But, when a grandchild is present, the impact of
ADL limitations is tempered. Here, the presence of a grand-
child decreases the OR of a shift into coresidence from 1.78
(main effect) to 1.21 (the product two main effects and the
interaction effect). The interacted models convey that al-
though a tendency persists toward parent­child coresidence
in those situations where older adult need is heightened
(i.e., widowhood and worsened functional health), that ten-
dency is weaker in skip generation households.
Figures 1 and 2 are provided to further clarify the condi-
tionality of coresidence shifts on residence in a skip gen-
eration household at baseline. Specifically, in Figure 1, we

INTERGENERATIONAL CORESIDENCE AMONG CHINA'S ELDERLY POPULATION 267
presence of a grandchild in the household at baseline is as-
sociated with a lessening of the probability of shifting to
coresidence with a child at follow-up as compared with
comparable older adults without a grandchild in the house-
hold at baseline. The converse is observed for older adults
who remain married over the observation interval; in such
cases, residing in a skip generation household actually
slightly increases the probability of shifting to coreside with
a child at follow-up.
Figure 2, which presents predicted probabilities for cores-
idence shifting by change in functional health status, condi-
tional on grandchild presence, further conveys this pattern.
That is, among older adults with worsening ADLs, the prob-
ability of shifting into coresidence is lessened among those
who coreside with grandchildren at baseline, as compared
with those who do not coreside with grandchildren. Together,
these results suggest that grandchildren in skip generation
households may be providers of informal care when needs
arise, potentially substituting for older adults' own children.
In other words, in the face of pervasive outmigration and
heightened longevity, emerging old age support relations in
China may bridge not just two but three generations.

Based on our knowledge of the fluidity and bidirectional
quality of older adult living arrangements, we estimated
Models 4, 5, and 6, which predict movement out of coresi-
dent households for older adults coresident with one or
more children at baseline. Again, in support of the main hy-
potheses, the results show that older adults who coreside
with a child are much less likely to change to living without
a child by follow-up when their spouse dies in comparison
with those whose spouse remained living. Similarly, coresi-
dence status is less likely to change for those remaining
widowed over the survey interval as compared with those
who were married at follow-up. With respect to other co-
variates, we observe that older adult women are more likely
to transition out of child coresident households between
baseline and follow-up, and movement out of child co-
resident situations is less likely for those who also have a
grandchild coresiding at baseline. As compared with the
significant interactions between grandchild presence and
measures of older adult need (widowhood and declining
functional health) in Models 2 and 3, the results in Models
5 and 6 do not suggest that the effect of widowhood and
worsening ADLs on shifting out of coresidence depends on
the presence or absence of grandchildren. Apparently, the
movement into coresidence is qualitatively different from ex-
iting a coresidence situation. Taken together with the results
from Models 2 and 3, this suggests that coresident grandchil-
dren may substitute for own children as caregivers for ailing
or bereaved older adults, yet when such changes occur in
households that contain three generations, the presence of
grandchildren does not appear to free the parents to leave.
Following on our logic of coresidence and older adult
need, we might expect that a shift to child coresidence
would be even more likely in those cases where widowhood
and declining functional health overlap in the survey inter-
val. Such time periods would likely be highly fraught with
need for informal support, especially if the deceased spouse
had served as caregiver. However, additional analyses, in
which worsening ADLs and entrance into widowhood were
interacted, did not yield significant results. Finally, it is no-
table that we conducted a series of additional equations es-
timating interactions between gender and changes in marital
status and functional health, but these did not yield signifi-
cant results or substantial improvement in model fit and
thus are not presented here.
Discussion
The current article explored the impact of widowhood on
the probability that older adults not coresiding with a child
in China at time of baseline measurement have changed ar-
rangements and are living with a child at follow-up. We also
explored the reverse possibility--remaining coresident af-
ter experiencing widowhood. The results of our analysis al-
low us to comment on whether there is cause for pessimism
regarding the viability of intergenerational support systems
and family-based oldage security in a China facing rapid
population aging, urbanization, and a host of modernizing
influences. Other recent studies have taken up this question,
and their results frequently suggest that although child co
residence with elderly parents is on the decline, there is rea-
son for cautious optimism that support traditions will
survive and elders will remain secure and supported. For
instance, recent studies (e.g., Shengming, Chen, & Yang,
2003; Zimmer, Korinek, Knodel, & Chayovan, 2008) inves-
tigating the transfer of support from both coresident and
noncoresident children to parents in China and elsewhere in
Asia suggest patterns consistent with a "modified extended
family" in which care and support of elders are ensured,
albeit increasingly by children living at a distance (Litwak &
Kulis, 1987). Furthermore, several have observed that inter-
generational obligations and an "unwritten contract of
entitlement" between generations to coreside when one
generation is perceived as incapable of adequately provid-
ing for itself override desires for nuclear households and
result in persistent multigenerational living (Davis, 1993;
Ikels, 1993).
Our article contributes to this base of knowledge by high-
lighting the experiences of subgroups deemed particularly
needy. Although the average picture of older adulthood in
China is characterized by stability in residential context, we
find that such residential stability predominates among
older adults whose lives are otherwise stable. Movement
into particular life states, such as widowhood or disable-
ment, is often accompanied by shifts in living arrangements.
By highlighting residential change around these critical late
adulthood turning points, we gain greater understanding of
the durability of intergenerational support and responsive-
ness of grown children to aging parents' needs.
Our results are cause for cautious optimism. Our findings
on widowhood transitions as precursors of adult­child co
residence are robust across gender and completed family
size of older adults. This pattern suggests that older adults,
both men and women, and those with many children and
few continue to turn to child coresidence when they have
lost the support and companionship of their spouse. Like
other analyses (e.g., Davis & Harrell, 1993; Whyte, 2003b),
those presented here are not consistent with modernization
theory's predictions about eroding intergenerational sup-
port and coresidential living arrangements. Although par-
ent­child coresidence may be on the decline overall, it does
not appear to have been wholly undermined as an institu-
tion. It rises sharply following widowhood and otherwise
remains pervasive among relatively "needy" elders, such as
those who have a number of and severe ADL limitations.
Our study, like others (e.g., Roan & Raley, 1996), reveals
the insights gained through the use of panel data. Here, we
delineate the attendant rise in coresidential living that fol-
lows rather rapidly in the wake of widowhood, a change
even more likely when the widowhood transition occurs
concurrently with deterioration in functional health.
INTERGENERATIONAL CORESIDENCE AMONG CHINA'S ELDERLY POPULATION 269
The results presented here only begin to explore how
health and other life transitions influence parent­child sup-
port relations, specifically as captured through coresidence.
Although the current analysis adds to a growing body of
literature on coresidence with children, there has been far
less exploration of coresidence with grandchildren, a situa-
tion likely to increase with the progression of population
aging and migration. We begin to explore the potential im-
pact of living with grandchildren, hypothesizing that living
with a grandchild might attenuate the association of child
coresidence with widowhood and ADLs. Grandchildren in
the household in most instances promote moving from non
coresidence to coresidence with children regardless of the
other characteristics in place.Yet, we consider that one of our
most important findings is that grandchild coresidence sig-
nificantly lessens the shift to child coresidence following the
event of widowhood or worsening functional health, suggest-
ing that the pull to return to provide care may be absorbed, in
part, by the younger generation. Although tentative, our re-
sults on grandchild coresidence suggest an alternative route
through which families in China are seeing to the care of
older adults in need. A picture thus emerges of family altru-
ism as a product not just of one's children's decisions and
acts but of multiple generations of family members acting
together to look after the well-being of other members' needs.
The current study has several limitations, which should
be addressed in further research. First, to gain a more com-
prehensive understanding, analyses of additional dimen-
sions of intergenerational support to widows and widowers
(e.g., economic exchange, instrumental support, and visits)
are necessary (Frankenberg et al., 2002). In future work,
additional modules of the CLHLS can be combined to ex-
amine whether marital status transitions contribute to
changes in older adults' instrumental and emotional support
relations with children as well as changes in the net flow of
financial resources between older adults and their children.
Second, a few words on potential bias due to survey attri-
tion are warranted.Virtually, all panel data sets are impacted
by some degree of attrition related to nonresponse or loss to
follow-up linked to migration or death. The CLHLS is no
exception to this. However, missing data related to the ail-
ing health of respondents is addressed and practically elim-
inated through the use of proxy respondents. The extent of
attrition due to loss to follow-up is minor (i.e., ranging from
9 to 12% across each of the survey intervals). Because the
survey includes the oldest old, a far greater share of attrition
across waves occurs due to death, with a full 30­50% of
respondents dying between waves of CLHLS data collec-
tion. Rather than constructing a model that controls for se-
lectivity of attrition due to death (an approach complicated
by the difficulty of arriving at a suitable instrumental vari-
able that predicts mortality but not coresidence shifting), we
note that our analysis likely underestimates the extent of co
residence shifting associated with transition into widow-
hood and worsening functional health.As shown in previous
analyses of survivors and decedents in the CLHLS data
(Zimmer & Korinek, 2010), older adults who have died (an
outcome positively correlated with widowhood and rela-
tively poor functional health) are more likely to have shifted
their coresidence situation during the survey interval than
those who have survived. However, these earlier analyses
also indicate that the determinants of coresidence shifting
are virtually the same for survivors (those captured in the
current study) and decedents.
Also worthy of further exploration is the question of how
caregiving varies by proximity of children and other kin.
Although coresidence reflects traditional arrangements and
preferences, it is the proximity of kin and children specifi-
cally, which matters for provision of care (Ikels, 1993;
Zimmer & Korinek, 2008). Especially as housing construc-
tion has expanded, functions once performed by coresident
kin may now be performed by adult children in nearby inde-
pendent households. Adult children's perspectives and the
competing demands on their time and financial resources as
opposed to those of other family members are also an im-
portant part of the equation (Ikels, 1993). Finally, although
longitudinal approaches provide a much needed dynamic
view of living arrangements in older adulthood, the line of
questioning and timing of survey waves in the CLHLS does
not provide a definitive picture of the causal ordering of
functional health, marital, and living arrangement transi-
tions. Theory serves as a useful guide, but alternative expla-
nations and interpretations are indeed possible.
Much interest in the fate of China's elderly population is
being generated by the overwhelming consequences of Chi-
na's enormous social experiment initiated by its "one-child
policy," enacted in 1979. Even the youngest elderly persons
in the current analysis (age 65 years in 2002) completed
their childbearing years prior to the policy, and most have
three or more surviving children. Thus, analyses of the im-
pacts of the one-child policy on supports for the elderly
must await the aging of the 1980s childbearing cohorts and
future data collection efforts. Nevertheless, conservative in-
terpretation of the current and other similar studies implies
that coresidence, whether with a child or grandchild, may
continue to be an important aspect of social structure for
older adults in China well into the future.
