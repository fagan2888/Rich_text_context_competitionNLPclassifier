GIVEN the rapid aging of society, older adults' social
integration is an increasingly salient, policy-relevant
issue. Studies show that remaining socially integrated
through life course challenges has substantial health bene-
fits. These benefits have been attributed to a range of pro-
cesses, from the provision of social support to a sense of
belonging and self-esteem (Berkman & Glass, 2000; House,
Landis, & Umberson, 1988; Thoits, 1995). Social geron-
tologists therefore stress the importance of continued social
integration via volunteering, religious participation, group
involvement, family relations, and social network connect-
edness (Adams & Blieszner, 1995; Antonucci & Akiyama,
1987; Atchley, 1989; Cornwell, Laumann, & Schumm,
2008; Crosnoe & Elder, 2002; Krause, 2006; Lemon,
Bengtson, & Peterson, 1972; Li & Ferraro, 2005; Rowe &
Kahn, 1998; Shaw, Krause, Liang, & Bennett, 2007).
Of the many forms of social integration that scientists can
consider, social network connectedness--a concept which
encompasses many structural features--may be the most
difficult to measure thoroughly. It requires consideration
not only of one's connectedness to other people but also of
those persons' connectedness to each other. Unfortunately,
there is a lack of such social network data from representa-
tive samples of older adults.
This paper describes the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Project's (NSHAP) social network module and
the resulting data. In-home interviews were conducted by
the National Opinion Research Center in 2005­2006 among
a nationally representative sample of 3,005 community-
dwelling adults between the ages of 57 and 85 years. The
sample was selected using a multistage area probability de-
sign, with oversampling among older men, Blacks, and His-
panics. The weighted response rate was 75.5%. (For a
complete description of the NSHAP sample design, see the
paper by O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman, & Smith [in press].)
Here, we outline the rationale behind the types of social net-
work data the NSHAP study collected and the procedures
used to collect them, describe key features of social net-
works which are likely to be relevant to aging and health,
and present some preliminary findings regarding features of
older adults' social networks.
Measuring Social Networks in a National
Survey
The first step in collecting social network data is to iden-
tify--for each respondent (referred to as ego)--the relevant
set of individuals (referred to as alters) and the types of re-
lationships that connect them (Laumann, Marsden, &
Prensky, 1983). Many researchers who wish to study social
networks begin with a preidentified set of roles (e.g., family,
friends) and assume that the people occupying those roles
relative to ego are the most relevant. For example, a com-
mon approach in the health literature is to count the number
of people occupying such roles, often restricting attention to
individuals with whom ego interacts frequently face-to-face

Objectives. This paper describes the rationale behind the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project's (NSHAP)
social networks module, data collection procedures, and the measurement of several egocentric network properties. This
includes a discussion of network size, composition, volume of contact with network members, density, and bridging po-
tential. Data on the extent to which older adults involve network members in personal health matters are also discussed.
Methods. Descriptive statistics are presented for key network measures. Sociodemographic distributions of these mea-
sures are presented. Older adults' likelihood of discussing health with network members is also broken down by network
member characteristics.
Results. Older adults tended to have large, kin-centered, dense networks, with some bridging potential. Network
characteristics were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and health. Older adults tended to be very likely to
involve network members (especially close ties) in health discussions and medical decision making.
Discussion. The data reiterate the relevance of social networks to older adults' health. We close by discussing how the
NSHAP measures might be employed in future analyses of health.

(e.g., Cohen, Doyle, Skoner, Rabin, & Gwaltney, 1997;
see also the description of this approach in Berkman and
Kawachi, 2000). However, there are two serious limitations
to this approach. First, it does not allow ego to specify the
kinds of contacts that are most important to him or her. Sec-
ond, measures of network connectedness that are collected
in this manner are sensitive to more general forms of social
integration. For example, if coworkers are counted in a so-
cial network index, employed individuals will automatically
have larger networks. This makes it difficult to discern the
unique impact of social network connectedness specifically,
as opposed to broader aspects of social integration.
In order to avoid these limitations, NSHAP utilized a
module that permits each respondent to identify several net-
work members of relevance to him or her and obtains infor-
mation about these people and the relationships among
them. In the case of a national survey with tiny sampling
fraction, individual respondents are unlikely to be directly
connected to each other, and it would therefore be of little
value (not to mention impractical) to collect "sociocentric"
network data describing respondents' network connections
to each other (e.g., Christakis & Fowler, 2007). Rather, the
task becomes to identify a set of persons around each re-
spondent and describe the relationships that link them to the
respondent and to each together. This provides a "local"
sample from the larger social network that encompasses
ego. Network data collected in this way are referred to as
egocentric. An egocentric network consists of k actors, in-
cluding ego and a set of k - 1 alters. The network can be
represented by a k × k matrix in which the element in the rth
row and cth column describes the relationship from indi-
vidual r to individual c. Further discussion of issues in-
volved in measuring social networks in the context of
surveys can be found in Laumann and Schumm (1997).
The NSHAP Social Networks Module
To collect egocentric network data, NSHAP adopted an
approach developed by social network researchers which
involves using questions called name generators to permit
the respondent to enumerate relevant alters (for a review of
research using this approach, see Marsden [1990]). The NS-
HAP networks module was located at the beginning of the
in-home interview. (For more information on the structure
of the interview, see the discussion of the interview of Smith
et al. [in press]. The questionnaire [along with the data] may
be obtained from the National Archive of Computerized
Data on Aging [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACDA/].)
The networks module was introduced to respondents in
the following way: "Now we are going to ask you some
questions about your relationships with other people. We
will begin by identifying some of the people you interact
with on a regular basis." Because NSHAP was interested in
assessing several types of network members, there were
four "rosters," or lists of people, in the networks module: A,
B, C, and D. Roster A was focused on collecting data on
respondents' core confidantes. To this end, following the
General Social Survey (years 1985 and 2004), NSHAP in-
terviewers asked respondents to list people with whom they
discuss "important matters."
"From time to time, most people discuss things that are
important to them with others. For example, these may in-
clude good or bad things that happen to you, problems you
are having, or important concerns you may have. Looking
back over the last 12 months, who are the people with whom
you most often discussed things that were important to you?
(Prompt if do not know: This could be a person you tend to
talk to about things that are important to you.)"
Respondents could name up to five people; those who
named five were then asked if there were any others. Thus,
we can discern if their networks contain anywhere from
zero to "six or more" contacts.
The "important matters" item is a well-established name
generator for network studies in sociology. It elicits names
of strong, frequently accessed, long-term confidantes (see
Marin, 2004; Ruan, 1998)--ties through which normative
pressures and social influence are likely to operate. Studies
based on this question have yielded important insights about
social contacts who are particularly influential in adults'
lives (e.g., Burt, 1987; Deng & Bonacich, 1991; Knoke,
1990; Marsden, 1987; Moore, 1990; Straits, 1996).
Rosters B, C, and D capture other potentially important
network members. When respondents who had a spouse or
romantic partner did not include that person in Roster A,
that individual was then recorded in Roster B. Following
this, respondents were asked: "(Besides the people you al-
ready listed), is there anyone (else) who is very important to
you, perhaps someone with whom you feel especially
close?" If such an individual was identified, he or she was
recorded in Roster C. This item was added to ensure inclu-
sion of important social contacts that may not have been
captured by the main name generator. Finally, any remain-
ing household members not captured in Roster A, B, or C
were added to Roster D. The NSHAP network data are pro-
vided in a dyad-level file in which each row contains infor-
mation about a specific network member for a given
respondent (i.e., multiple rows per respondent).
Table 1 displays the distributions of the number of alters
identified in each of the rosters. All together, there are
13,125 alters in the network dyad file. There are 10,189 al-
ters from Roster A. About 15% of the sample (455 respon-
dents) added a spouse or partner in Roster B. Over half of
the sample (1,633 respondents) claimed to have at least one
other person to whom they are "especially close," beyond
the network members already mentioned. The final column
shows that 85% of respondents reported no additional
household members beyond those named in preceding ros-
ters. The remaining 15% added a total of 848 household
members in Roster D. Only 28% of respondents reported
living alone.
SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE NSHAP STUDY i49
It is important to note that the social networks module
was incorporated into the NSHAP interview in such a way
as to avoid a potential deficiency in the General Social Sur-
vey (GSS) network data. Marsden (2003) found substantial
between-interviewer variation in the number of alters
named by GSS respondents--as large as or larger than dif-
ferences associated with respondent characteristics. This
high degree of between-interviewer variability may have
been partly due to the fact that the GSS networks module
appeared in the middle of the interview. Differences be-
tween interviewers in the manner in which the module was
presented (e.g., the extent to which it was rushed, the will-
ingness to clarify or probe, etc.) combined with factors
such as respondent fatigue may have reduced the number of
alters cited by some respondents. Furthermore, survey con-
tent which precedes questions about alters can affect inter-
pretations of the name generator (Bailey & Marsden, 1999;
Bearman & Parigi, 2004; Straits, 2000), thus potentially af-
fecting the number of alters named. The NSHAP networks
module was positioned at the beginning of the interview to
avoid these problems.
Following the enumeration of alters, NSHAP collected sev-
eral pieces of information about each alter from respondents
(such items are known as name interpreters). First, following
the GSS and many other egocentric studies, we asked the
respondent to describe his or her relationship to each alter
(e.g., kin, friend) and the alter's gender. For alters in Rosters
A­C, we recorded whether the alter lives with ego (to permit
construction of a complete household roster), ego's frequency
of contact with and emotional closeness to alter, ego's likeli-
hood of discussing health matters with alter, and the alter's
frequency of contact with each of the other alters listed in
Rosters A­C (this provides a basis for assigning values to the
elements in the egocentric network matrix described earlier).
We also asked the age of all alters who live with ego. This in-
formation is summarized in Table 2; we now consider each
item in greater detail.
Social Network Measures
It is important to consider a variety of measures of social
network connectedness as both structural and emotional
aspects of networks are likely to be associated with health
at older ages. In the following sections, we discuss several
aspects of network connectedness that may be related to
older adults' health. Descriptive statistics for each measure
are presented in Table 3 separately according to several so-
ciodemographic characteristics. Trend tests were conducted
to assess whether the distribution of each network
characteristic was uniform across groups. (Each network

SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE NSHAP STUDY i51
Network Size
The most basic measure is egocentric network size. All
else equal, individuals who have larger social networks have
greater access to social resources like instrumental and so-
cioemotional support. Because NSHAP used a variation of
the "important matters" name generator, a measure of net-
work size derived from these data captures the extent to
which a person has the strong types of social ties that are
most likely to provide social support.
The findings from Roster A deserve particular attention
given the importance of discussion networks to social influ-
ence and support. Few respondents reported having no con-
fidantes. In fact, the modal number reported by NSHAP
respondents was five, with over one third of the sample re-
porting that they have five or more confidantes. As shown
in Table 3, women, Whites, higher educated people, and
healthier respondents reported having larger confidante
networks.
Network Composition
Network composition refers to the types of contacts ego
maintains. Network composition can be defined in various
ways, such as the prevalence of specific types of tie (e.g.,
friends) in the network or the overall diversity of ties within
it. Many researchers in medical sociology and social geron-
tology focus on the proportion of kin because kin relations
are the most likely to provide unconditional support in the
face of health crises (Antonucci &Akiyama, 1987; Hurlbert,
Haines, & Beggs, 2000).
To make it possible to identify a wider variety of rela-
tionship types in older adults' networks, NSHAP asked
respondents to characterize their relationship with each
alter as 1 of the following 18 types: spouse, ex-spouse,
romantic/sexual partner, parent, parent-in-law, child,
stepchild, sibling, other relative, other in-law, friend,
neighbor, coworker or boss, minister/priest/other clergy,
psychiatrist/psychologist/counselor/therapist, caseworker/
social worker, housekeeper/home health care provider, or
other. As seen from Table 3, older adults' networks are
mainly kin centered. However, there are some differences
in network composition across demographic groups. Lati-
nos tended to report more kin-centered networks than
Whites. About two thirds of Whites' and Blacks' networks
comprised kin compared with nearly 80% of Latinos'
networks. People with less formal education also reported
networks with a higher proportion of kin. With respect to
other aspects of network composition, men reported hav-
ing fewer female confidantes, as did Whites (compared
with Blacks) and more highly educated people. About one
fourth of network members lived with the respondent.
(About 80% of coresident network members were the
respondent's spouse or current partner.) Older respondents,
women, and Whites (compared with Latinos) reported
fewer coresident alters.
Emotional Closeness to Network Members
The subjective, emotional quality of relationships has
been linked to well-being (Wellman & Wortley, 1990) and
may modulate the effect of other network features on well-
being (Fiori, Antonucci, & Cortina, 2006). High-quality re-
lationships are the most likely to provide individuals with a
sense of belonging and self-esteem. Unlike studies that con-
ceptualize emotional closeness in terms of relationship type
(e.g., automatically assuming that kin ties are closer),
NSHAP measured relationship quality directly by asking
respondents: "How close do you feel is your relationship
with [name]?" Possible responses included "not very close,"
"somewhat close," "very close," or "extremely close" (in
that order). This item was modeled after an item in the GSS
networks module. Emotional closeness is summarized in
Table 3 using the average closeness rating (coded 1­4)
across alters. Most older adults maintain close contacts.
However, the oldest adults, men, and those who are in poorer
health reported being less close to their network members.
Volume of Contact With Network Members
All else equal, more contact with alters means more ac-
cess to resources and social support (Lin, Woelfel, & Light,
1985; Munch, McPherson, & Smith-Lovin, 1997). Contact
volume therefore affects the potential impact of networks on
health (Seeman & Berkman, 1988; Terhell, van Groenou, &
van Tilburg, 2007). NSHAP respondents reported how of-
ten they talk to each alter on an 8-point scale, ranging from
"every day" to "less than once per year." One can score
these responses according to the approximate number of
times per year ego interacts with alter (e.g., "once a
month"=12; "every day"=365) and sum these scores across
all alters in Roster A to obtain a measure of overall volume
of contact with alters. This measure depends both on aver-
age frequency of interaction with each network member and
on network size, so it is closely related to both (Table 4).
The findings presented in Table 3 show that on average,
older adults report nearly two contacts per day with a close
confidante. The oldest adults in the sample and men re-
ported fewer contacts per year than younger adults and
women, respectively.
Network Density
In addition to the relationships between ego and alter, it is
also important to consider the presence and nature of rela-
tionships among alters. One way to address this is through
the concept of network density, defined as the proportion of
all possible pairs among the alters in which the two indi-
viduals know each other. High-density networks constitute
close-knit social contexts in which alters can share and
compare information, coordinate caregiving duties, and
pool resources. Thus, high network density is associated
with more reliable and more frequent activation of informal
support (Haines, Hurlbert, & Beggs, 1996; Hurlbert et al.,
CORNWELL ET AL.
i52
2000). Consider, for example, a widowed woman who is
recovering from heart surgery. If her children and her clos-
est friends know each other well, they can arrange to moni-
tor and care for her in shifts during her recovery at home.
The relationship of this aspect of network structure to health
has not been explored in depth, though there are some
exceptions (e.g., Kelley-Moore, Schumacher, Kahana, &
Kahana, 2006).
NSHAP respondents were asked to indicate how often
each alter talks to each of the other alters. The response set
was the same as that used for the relationship between ego
and alter, with the additional response "have never spoken
to each other." Although weighted measures of density are
available which take into account the frequency of contact
among alters, for simplicity, we present here an unweighted
measure, calculated as the proportion of k(k - 1)/2 pairs in
which the two individuals merely know each other. Table 3
shows that older adults' networks are quite dense, with 85%
of all possible ties among alters being present, on average.
Men, Latinos, and those in the "other" racial/ethnic cate-
gory, and less educated respondents tended to report more
dense networks.
Network Bridging Potential
A concept that is even more rarely considered in the con-
text of health research is that of bridging. Bridging occurs
when ego maintains connections with at least two alters
who, without ego, would not be connected to each other.
Serving as a bridge can be useful to individuals for a variety
of reasons. For one, it yields brokerage potential because
those who occupy bridging positions can gain power from
the mediation of exchange and transfer of resources and in-
formation between unconnected parties (Burt, 1992, 2005).
Bridging increases access to separate pools of information
and resources (Granovetter, 1973), a valuable option when
one seeks advice from numerous sources. Finally, those
who maintain separate circles of close contacts tend to ex-
hibit greater individuality and have more independence
(Cornwell, 2009; Krackhardt, 1999).
Like network density, bridging potential is evaluated us-
ing information on the presence or absence of relationships
among alters. A person has bridging potential whenever two
alters are unconnected to each other. Therefore, a person's
bridging potential could be quantified as the number of pairs
of alters in his or her network who are not directly con-
nected to each other--the number that reportedly "have
never spoken to each other." However, it is important to rec-
ognize that some other individual apart from ego could
serve as an indirect link between the unconnected pair. This
is not likely to be the case for alters who have had no con-
tact with any of ego's other alters. Therefore, we operation-
alize bridging potential as a dichotomous indicator of
whether there is any alter in ego's network who is uncon-
nected to all the other alters (Cornwell, 2009). In such cases,
ego constitutes the sole bridge between this alter and the
others--at least within his or her egocentric network (other
bridges may exist which involve individuals outside the re-
spondent's egocentric network). All else equal, those who
have low network density will have the most bridging po-
tential of this kind as density and bridging are inversely re-
lated (see Table 4). Therefore, it is not surprising that men,
Latinos, and those in the "other" racial/ethnic category ex-
hibited significantly less bridging potential.
Assessing Network Members' Involvement in
Health-Related Decisions
The NSHAP study was particularly interested in the rela-
tionship between aspects of social connectedness and health.
Much research has examined the link between older adults'
network connectedness and health. However, little is known
about the extent to which older adults include their alters
directly in discussions about their health or involve them in
decisions regarding medical treatment. This is a potentially
important mechanism by which network connectedness
may affect health (and vice versa). In this section, we de-
scribe two additional items included in NSHAP that permit
one to address this issue.
Network Members in Health Discussions
The health benefits of being socially connected may de-
pend on open communication with one's network members,
including the candid exchange of health-related concerns.
When health is discussed openly, alters may be better able
to identify and deliver the kind of support, care, and other
resources a person needs. With this in mind, NSHAP asked
respondents about the prospects of health-related discus-
sions with each of the alters they listed in Rosters A, B, and
C. The question was: "Suppose you had a health problem
that you were concerned about, or needed to make an im-
portant decision about your own medical treatment. How
likely is it that you would talk with [name] about this: Would
you say very likely, somewhat likely, or not likely"? This
question was designed by the NSHAP team, but it was in-
formed by items used in Lin, Dean, and Ensel (1986).
What features of older adults' relationships with alters
are associated with the likelihood that they discuss health
openly with them? This question can be easily examined
using the dyad-level network file supplied with the NSHAP
data set (described earlier) which includes data on respon-
dents' level of openness in health-related discussions with
the 12,277 alters in Rosters A, B, and C. Table 5 shows how
the likelihood of including alters in discussions about health
issues or medical decisions is related to the characteristics
of the alters themselves and the nature of their relationships
with ego.
Several items are worth noting. First, older adults are in
general very open to discussing health matters with their
alters, reporting that they were "very likely" to discuss
SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THE NSHAP STUDY i53
health with two thirds of their alters. However, whether they
are likely to discuss important health matters with a given
alter does appear to be associated with the nature of the re-
lationship. More older adults say that they are "very likely"
to discuss health with their spouse than with any other indi-
vidual, followed by children, siblings, romantic partners,
then other relatives, friends, and other nonrelatives. Like-
wise, health discussions are strongly associated with rela-
tionship strength; older adults are more likely to discuss
health with those alters with whom they feel close and with
whom they have frequent contact. Respondents were also
more likely to discuss health with female alters and with
those who are coresident.
Network Members in Medical Decision Making
Apart from the inclusion of social network members in
health discussions, it is also useful to examine older adults'
consideration of alters as proxy medical decision makers.
An increasing number of people are establishing advanced
directives, such as durable powers of attorney for health
care (DPAHC), to help extend their control over future med-
ical treatments. Research suggests that most older adults
trust someone to make medical decisions on their behalf. In
general, preferences for medical decision makers are hierar-
chically ordered as follows: spouse, children, other rela-
tives, and then nonkin (Carr & Khodyakov, 2007; Hopp,
2000; Noelker & Bass, 1994).
To assess the role played by alters in proxy medical deci-
sion making, we asked respondents: "Do you have someone
who you would like to make medical decisions for you if
you were unable, as for example if you were seriously in-
jured or very sick?" If so, we then assessed this person's
role in the respondent's social network by asking: "Is this
person one of the people you identified earlier?" If so, they
were asked to identify this person from the network roster.
In order to save time during the interview, these questions
were asked of a randomly selected two thirds of the sample
during the in-person interview, whereas the remainder re-
ceived it in the leave-behind questionnaire. Because the
completed rosters were not left behind for respondents' ref-
erence, the follow-up question about whether medical deci-
sion makers were in the network was only asked of those
who were administered these items during the interview.
A vast majority of respondents (92%) had designated a
medical decision maker. Of these, 94% indicated that their
designee was one of the people they had named in one of
the network rosters. Nearly all (96%) the alters identified as
medical decision makers were kin (usually the spouse or a
child). These findings are similar to those reported by Carr
and Khodyakov (2007), who find that 96% of the people in
their study who appointed a DPAHC named a family mem-
ber. The egocentric network is also relevant for those few
respondents who had no spouse, partner, or children and
who reported that they had a medical decision maker
(n=72). Among these respondents, 89% reported that their
medical decision maker was a social network member.
Overall, these results suggest that older adults' see social
network members as playing a key role in their long-term
medical treatment.
Conclusions
The NSHAP study affords researchers the opportunity to
develop a comprehensive picture of older adults' social
networks. The findings presented here suggest that older
adults are well connected socially. They have relatively
large core discussion networks and access to a variety of
types of social contacts. Analysis of basic measures of net-
work structure--including size, composition, density, and
bridging-- reveals several differences between sociodemo-
graphic subgroups which deserve closer scrutiny in future
research by medical sociologists and social gerontologists.
The NSHAP network data make it possible to explore
several links between health and social life, which are thus
far poorly understood. We know that older adults' social
network members are central to medical decision-making
processes. An issue that calls for more research, though, is
older adults' openness about personal health issues with
their social network members. The free exchange of health-
related information may make older adults' networks more

efficient with respect to the mobilization of support and de-
livery of advice and other resources. With the NSHAP data,
researchers can examine how respondents' attributes, net-
work members' characteristics, and the nature of their rela-
tionships with each other facilitate or impede the sharing of
health-related concerns. These factors should be employed
in future research on the role of social networks in affecting
older adults' health.
