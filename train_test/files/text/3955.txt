Introduction
Social Network Analysis (SNA) consists of theories and
methods for analysing social relationships. Based on the
mathematical framework known as graph theory, SNA uti-
lises a formal language for developing concepts and ideas
in order to describe patterns of interaction between indi-
viduals. Graph theory affords the representation of rela-
tional information in a sociogram or graph, as was originally
posited in the early 1930s by Jacob Moreno, who is consid-
ered the pioneer of the use of graph theory for identifying
properties of social networks. Relational information is
incorporated in a sociogram by drawing points and lines.
Points, also named nodes or vertices in different nomencla-
tures, represent individuals. Lines, edges or arcs, when
present, depict the existence of relationships between these
individuals (Scott, 2000; Knoke and Yang, 2008; Borgatti
et al., 2013).
Increased interest in analysing criminal networks has
encouraged the use of SNA as an analytic tool to investigate
them. Scott and Carrington (2011) suggested that criminal net-
works are formed by people who are involved in `networked
activities'. This definition leads to a better explanation of the
nature of criminal relationships by highlighting the fact that
individuals committing crimes need to be organised. Since a
network provides a reliable mechanism for optimising resource
exchanges (Bright, 2015), we speculate that the more criminal
activities are planned and coordinated by individuals, the bet-
ter organised and effective a criminal group becomes. This
aspect is particularly relevant for criminal networks in which
actions should remain maximally undercover to limit the pos-
sibility that individuals committing a crime would be detected.
We suggest that in order to investigate criminal networks, it is
necessary to focus on people's participation in criminal actions
and how they maximise their efficiency under secrecy.
We conceptualised a network model (Brandes et al., 2013)
as based on two distinct aspects of social interactions in a

Abstract
Criminal organisations tend to be structured as a network in order to optimise flows of resource exchanges. The consolidation
of these structures strengthens the criminal organisation's capability of becoming more and more efficient over time. Recently,
researchers in the field of covert networks have begun to analyse the dynamics of these networks. Thus far, the models and
methods used to analyse the temporal dynamics of covert networks have come with a number of limitations. Our approach
for analysing temporal dynamics attempts to address some of these limitations. In this article, we extend the use of dynamic
line-graphs to bipartite networks for incorporating time directly into the network, and we suggest an alternative way to
visualise the evolution of actors' participation in successive covert actions and events. Our article intends to contribute to
the research on dynamic networks by proposing a new approach for representing temporal dynamics in covert networks.
After illustrating our method, we present some examples of its use on real-world data for visualising network evolutions
over time.

covert context. The first aspect refers to the idea of coopera-
tion since individuals joining actions together are coopera-
tively involved in the realisation of a specific criminal and/or
covert intent. The second aspect considers the fact that covert
actions are simultaneous. Individuals involved in the same
action, in fact, act simultaneously and in a specific point in
time. When few members of a criminal organisation are
involved in performing the same task, such as terrorist
attacks, secret meetings and violent protests, the relationship
between each pair of these individuals involved can be
defined as a concurrent partnership since their relationships
overlap in time. The main implication of including the idea
of partnerships overlapping in time (Moody et al., 2005) in
our network model is that of emphasising the relevance of
the time dimension as a central aspect for the analysis of cov-
ert networks.
Our article seeks to contribute to the work on the analysis
of longitudinal networks by proposing an alternative method
for representing temporal dynamics. The article proceeds as
follows. First, we review some of the existing SNA works
that considered the issue of time, and, second, we provide an
overview of recent contributions related to temporal dynam-
ics in the specific field of criminal networks. Third, after a
theoretical introduction of our approach, we demonstrate the
utility of the method on three real covert network data sets.
Related work
The issue of time is of increasing importance in SNA, result-
ing in considerable interest in analysing dynamic networks
(Snijders and Doreian, 2010, 2012). Research belonging to
the area of longitudinal network analyses use several meth-
ods for analysing the fluid nature of networks over time. We
categorised the research themes into five research areas by
examining how the aspect of time is considered and what
methods are used.
The first area of research focused on network temporal
dynamics mainly for analysing the propagation of diseases
and the risk of transmission of infections by using statistical
simulations (Morris and Kretzschmar, 1995, 1997; Moody,
2002; Kontoleon et al., 2013). In this research, the start and
end times of relationships influenced the level of reachability
among individuals since overlapping relationships offered
alternative routes of diffusion, as well as making some tra-
versing paths impossible. The second area of research
addressed the issue of time by partitioning a given time win-
dow in a series of temporal snapshots, or intervals. Through
the analyses of network properties in each time interval,
these authors focused on the evolution of group and commu-
nitystructures(NakaoandRomney,1993;Tantipathananandh
et al., 2007) as well as node level measures (Kim and
Anderson, 2012). The third area went beyond a descriptive
analysis of how time constraints affected network properties
by utilising an actor-oriented model, namely the stochastic
actor-oriented model (SAOM), for examining the
co-evolution of social networks and individual behaviours
(Snijders, 2001; Snijders et al., 2010). Examples of pro-
cesses modelled using the SAOM include homophily ten-
dencies (Lazega et al., 2012) and mechanisms based on
social capital (Agneessens and Wittek, 2012). The fourth
area of research referred to a specific framework and data
structure, namely the Relational Event Model. This model
for analysing longitudinal networks defined human actions,
such as a chain of events, related to each other through the
fact that individuals took part together in these actions (Butts,
2008). The ties are events and as such instantaneous as
opposed to standard social network ties that are considered
states. Finally, the last area relied upon new visualisation
methods for providing a better representation of temporal
networks. An important contribution came from Moody et al.
(2005). These authors proposed to combine an animation
technique, which shows the heterogeneity between tempo-
rally adjacent network slices, with summary statistics of net-
work properties that capture the proportion of arcs changing
from iteration to iteration. Another recent contribution in
terms of visualisation techniques has been provided by
Brandes et al. (2012). By referring to SAOM, in this article,
the authors focused on the co-evolution of networks and
individual behaviours over a sequence of time slices. In par-
ticular, they provided algorithms in order to capture the level
of homogeneity among individuals as well as to detect indi-
viduals with different behaviour through the visualisation of
discrepancies between simulated and observed statistics.
The idea we propose in this article falls in this last cate-
gory. Specifically, our contribution introduces a different
technique for the representation and visualisation of longitu-
dinal networks composed of two different entities such as
individuals and events.
Longitudinal analyses in the field of criminal networks
are rare. Some authors measured individuals' centrality over
a series of tasks temporally ordered (Toth et al., 2013) or
compared the level of stability and prominence reached by
individuals in several time snapshots (Sharara et al., 2012).
Others examined structural changes over time (Helfstein
and Wright, 2011) and analysed the network's growth from
the perspective of roles played by individuals in order to
keep the network flexible and balanced between secrecy
and efficiency (Bright and Delaney, 2013). Moreover,
Cunningham et al. (2015) used the SAOM to capture the
importance of pre-existing ties in a terrorist network. In
addition, some authors focused on longitudinal studies to
reveal how individual positions change over time using a
blockmodeling approach (Xu et al., 2004) and along several
snapshots (Carley, 2014; Stevenson and Crossley, 2014).
Finally, criminologists have begun to develop a new per-
spective for analysing the evolution of a criminal action. In
this perspective, the analysis of criminal activities integrates
SNA with the crime script analysis. A criminal action is
interpreted as several logical phases, each characterised by
specific tasks that need to be accomplished. Since each actor
Broccatelli et al. 3
is then associated with a specific task, this technique can
reveal the involvement of actors over the sequential steps
and highlighting the presence of subgroups of offenders spe-
cialised in a specific task (Bruinsma and Bernasco, 2004) as
well as the role each actor played for the success of the oper-
ation (Morselli and Roy, 2008).
The above-mentioned methods for analysing temporal
network dynamics present some limitations that influence
their possible applications in the field of covert networks.
First, the applicability of these approaches is affected by the
fact that these methods mostly require to split arbitrarily the
whole time window into several temporally adjacent inter-
vals. These time intervals tend to not totally capture the
dynamicity of network changes over time since they do not
control what happen in the given network between one interval
and the next. Depending on how the time intervals have been
identified, in fact, the distinction of time windows into sepa-
rate snapshots can either underestimate or overestimate the
connections among actors resulting in a partial understand-
ing of how the given network evolves over time. Second, a
more specific limitation concerning the use of applying these
methods for analysing covert networks is due to the paucity
of time data information. Most of the time, in fact, research-
ers in the field of covert networks do not know the exact start
and end time of a relationship and/or the duration of these
interactions (Gerdes, 2014); often they have information
only about the occurred events.
In this paper, we provide an alternative method for partially
overcoming these limitations in order to represent the tempo-
ral evolution of a covert network and the turnover of actors. In
particular, the main advantage of our proposed method is the
possibility of visualising the given network by maintaining the
linear progression of succeeding actions exactly as these
occurred and in which individuals took place together.
Model
The purpose of this section is to state the assumptions on the
basis of our model, to reveal from where we get an inspira-
tion for building our technique and to clearly define which
are the entities composing our pattern of relationships.
In this study, we assume that for analysing temporal
dynamics, it is necessary to focus on two aspects of people's
participation in actions, events or tasks: (1) the temporal
proximity between individuals; and (2) the individuals' tra-
jectories of participation in these actions over time. The first
aspect corresponds to tendencies towards collaboration and
reflects who collaborates with whom. The second aspect
refers to how often an individual attended an activity and/or
performed a task during the time considered. By following
the individual participation in activities over time, it is pos-
sible to have a good sense of individuals' engagement in
actions over the time considered. Through the bi-dynamic
line-graph representation, it is possible to capture those
dynamics and make them directly visible into the graph.
The pioneering work by Moody (2009) theorised a
dynamic network projection for one-mode networks in order
to analyse the channels of transmission of diseases. In this
case, every edge between a pair of individuals is represented
as a node, and new directed edges are added in the case in
which the nodes share an individual. By recording the dura-
tion of relationships as an attribute for each edge, Moody
used this dynamic line-graph in order to analyse the diffusion
of infections.
In this article, we build a similar dynamic line-graph pro-
jection for two-mode networks. Although Alexander pro-
posed the use of the line-graph representation as a reliable
option for visualising bipartite networks (Alexander, 2005),
we partially referred to Moody's principles in order to incor-
porate the time dynamics in the line-graph. In the next para-
graphs, we explain the steps that are necessary in order to
realise our adaption of a dynamic line-graph representation
for two-mode networks.
The process of constructing the bi-dynamic line-graph
from the original two-mode network is composed of three
separate steps. First, we consider a two-mode network in its
bipartite network structure. The bipartite network is an indi-
viduals-by-events matrix of affiliations where rows and col-
umns contain both individuals and events and only ties
between individuals and events exist (Borgatti et al., 2013).
Second, from the bipartite network, we generate a line-graph
projection. With the line-graph, edges between individuals
and events are transformed to nodes. As a result, in this visu-
alisation, a node represents an edge between an individual
and an event of the original two-mode graph. By construc-
tion, all nodes representing the same actor joining events are
connected by an edge. In order to track individual's histories
of participation in events, we use a reduction criterion for
ties. This criterion implies the exclusion of ties providing
redundant information. Thus, in the third step, we reduce ties
by maintaining only edges which connect nodes representing
the same actor joining events based on the sequence in which
these events occurred. The point of this construction is that
every individual attending an event in a specific point of time
is represented by a node. If an individual participates in suc-
ceeding events, there are as many nodes as the number of
events in which the individual took place and these nodes are
sequentially connected by a path. For example, a node refer-
ring to individual A participating at event 1 (A1) will have an
outgoing tie only towards the node referring to individual A
participating at event 2 (A2). If A also joined event 4, there
will be another outgoing tie between A2 and A4, throughout
a link between A1 and A4 is not present.
In a bi-dynamic line-graph, two sets of ties can be distin-
guished: reciprocal and uni-directional (we refer to the latter
as `directed' henceforth). Reciprocal ties connect nodes rep-
resenting different actors who have been engaged in activi-
ties together simultaneously. In this case, reciprocal ties
generate clusters and reflect the level of collaboration
between individuals. Directed ties, on the contrary, link
4 Methodological Innovations
nodes referring to the same individual who have attended
several events over time. These two sets of ties depict tem-
poral dynamics in terms of common participation in activi-
ties as well as individual's engagement during time. In other
words, while reciprocal ties capture the extent of the indi-
vidual's propensity of collaboration, directed ties follow the
individual's participation in events over time. An example
of the dynamic line-graph representation is given in Figure
2.
In the case of covert networks, reciprocal ties connect
nodes referring to individuals who took part together in
activities such as terrorist attacks, secret meetings and vio-
lent protests. A typical example is a member of a terrorist
group who is actively engaged in a bombing attack and
through the interactions with other participants establishes
reciprocal relationships. By contrast, directed ties link nodes
corresponding to a same individual who participated in sev-
eral activities over time. For each active actor, there is a
directed tie starting from the first action in which he partici-
pated to the following one until the last action in which the
individual took part. Directed ties reveal the history of the
individual's presence in the criminal organisation.
Why are bi-dynamic line-graph
representations really necessary?
In this section, we briefly discuss some advantages as well as
some limitations related to the use of our visualisation tech-
nique of representing two-mode networks. An intuitive way
to understand the advantages of a bi-dynamic line-graph rep-
resentation is to compare an original two-mode network
with its one-mode projection as well as with its bi-dynamic
line-graph representation. In the two-mode representation,
Figure 1(a), individuals are depicted as points, whereas events
are represented by squares. When an individual attended
an event, a tie connects the individual (point) and the
event (square). Since most SNA methods are developed for
one-mode networks, traditionally authors prefer to convert
the two-mode network into a one-mode network. Through
this conversion, the two-mode network is transformed into a
one-mode network in which individuals are linked to each
other to the extent that they participate in at least one event
together (Borgatti et al., 2013). Here, all vertices are individu-
als (point), and a tie between a pair of vertices represents the
fact that these individuals share person-to-person interactions
by attending the same event. Unfortunately, the one-mode
projection suffers from a loss of information regarding the
participation in events (Borgatti and Everett, 1997; Opsahl,
2013; Hollway and Koskinen, 2015). First, if there is a case in
which a person accomplished an activity (event) by himself,
this information would not be recorded in the one-mode pro-
jection. Second, visually speaking, unless the researcher
changes the thickness of the edges, it is impossible to quantify
how many times individuals have been involved in common
activities. By comparison, the bi-dynamic line-graph better
captures the evolution of an individual's engagement in the
events over time. Figure 1 shows an example of two-mode
network (a) and, respectively, its corresponding one-mode
network (b) and the bi-dynamic line-graph (c).
Using a matrix representation, relational information is
expressed by an adjacency matrix where rows and columns
represent points and values `1' into cells intersecting these
points indicate the presence of a tie between them.
Sociograms and matrices can be considered as two sides of
the same coin since adjacency and affiliation matrices may
be represented as graphs and graphs can be translated into
matrices. The matrices of the network visualisations showed
in Figure 1 are reported in Figure 2.

representation of the matrices in Figure 2.
Broccatelli et al. 5
The bi-dynamic line-graph replaces the standard node-as-
point representation in favour of a node-as-edge representa-
tion. This dynamic representation can offer a different way
for visualising to what extent a network changes and evolves
over time. The advantages of using a bi-dynamic line-graph
representation can be discussed under three headings.
Substantively, the first advantage is due to the fact that the
time dimension is directly incorporated into the graph,
instead of, for example, being added as an attribute or a prop-
erty to the edges. In the bi-dynamic line-graph, in fact, the
sequence of human interactions directly reflects how indi-
viduals have been engaged in actions over time. Nodes, rep-
resenting edges between individuals and events, are added as
they appear and straightforwardly can reveal how the net-
work materialises during the time.
The second advantage concerns the fact that with the bi-
dynamic line-graph, it is not necessary to divide the whole
time window into time intervals as is, for example, required
with the SAOM method. This representation of the dynamic
network is also distinct from decay-based approaches (e.g.,
Holme and Saramäki, 2012). The main implication of that is
the chance for researchers of avoiding to make arbitrary
decisions in identifying time slices. All time steps corre-
sponding to events, are, in fact, directly taken into account,
and actions, linked together by the common participation of
individuals, are represented as a chain, in a sort of continu-
ous social process.
Finally, since our bi-dynamic line-graph is specifically
designed for two-mode networks, this last advantage refers
to the possibility of utilising directly the two-mode network
format instead of the one-mode projection of the two-mode.
The use of the original affiliation matrix makes unnecessary
the loss of information that occurs when a two-mode
network is transformed in its one-mode conversion and to
consider both events and individuals as equally important
entities (Everett and Borgatti, 2013).
Beside the advantages, we also need to consider the disad-
vantages of our representation. To begin with, the bi-dynamic
line-graph does not capture clearly the temporal dynamics
among events. On the one hand, events may happen closely
together in time, but, on the other hand, they might be sepa-
rated by long periods of inactivity during which nothing has
been recorded. In the current form of a bi-dynamic line-
graph, time interval between events is not considered. This
implies that even though the bi-dynamic line-graph takes
into account the successive aspect of the sequential events, it
is not possible yet to reveal how these events are positioned
by considering the whole time window.
Moreover, for the purpose of the present work, we do not
consider the aspect of the duration of events. We follow the
convention of relational events and treat the events as instan-
taneous, allowing us to consider only the order and possibly
the time in-between events. For convenience, our basic
assumption is that any actor can only be in one place at any
one point in time. Although there is a possibility that two
events may happen simultaneously and that, for instance,
actor A participating in an event B precludes participating in
any other event taking place at the same time, we speculate
that this possibility would be relevant only in very specific
cases. As an example, we may consider the case in which a
terrorist cannot take part in a terrorist attack since this person
is already attending a training camp that lasts for a few
months and occurs at the exact same time of the attack.
Similarly, our approach is not suited to explain such things as
coordinated attacks. However, this is not a serious restriction
in our case due to the nature of events considered. In fact, for
the examples considered here, events, which correspond to
violent protests, terrorist kidnappings and Mafia meetings,
never overlap in time.
Finally, a third limitation concerns the specific matrix for-
mat of the bi-dynamic line-graphs. As mentioned earlier, the
bi-dynamic line-graph matrix presents contemporarily two
set of ties, reciprocal and directed. Due to this format, stand-
ard SNA measurements need to be adjusted in order to be
utilised. As such, at the moment, our representations can
only be seen as a basis for narrative about individuals'
involvement in criminal activities over time. Looking at who
joined the actions, at which point in time and with whom,
gives us the possibility of following and tracking the indi-
vidual's histories of participation in actions over time and,
therefore, it may provide insights about the hidden strategi-
cal organisation and structural dynamics within these covert
networks.
In this article, we hope to demonstrate how this represen-
tation can be a useful initial step for investigating the stabil-
ity of peoples' engagement as well as the turnover of
individual embeddedness in activities during the time. We
will now present some examples of the use of a bi-dynamic

aspects of the flows of individual's participation in actions
over time.
Effectiveness of dynamic network
representation on real covert networks
In this section, we illustrate the use of the dynamic line-
graph representation for visualising the evolution of a given
network and its temporal changes.
Data sets
UK Suffragette co-participation in meeting and actions in Bristol
and Bath.The network refers to the Women's Social and
Political Union (WSPU), a women's organisation in United
Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th century in order to
promote women's suffrage. In the United Kingdom, mem-
bers of the WSPU engaged in the campaign were arrested
and prosecuted by the authorities in order to maintain the
current status quo. As a result, Suffragettes used to act in
secrecy, particularly when they organised meetings for plan-
ning their protests. This particular data set concerns the co-
participation in events occurring in Bristol and Bath from
1907 until 1914. It involves 52 Suffragettes and 40 events. In
this data set, events correspond to meetings, demonstrations,
protests and vandalism acts. Data have been reconstructed
by considering historical sources of information such as
Suffragettes' diaries, autobiographies and local newspapers
(Edwards, 2014). This network is an example of a Covert
Social Movement Network, characterised by a strong orien-
tation towards a political and social change by acting protests
and violent acts (Crossley et al., 2012).
Philippines terrorist network.This network mostly refers to
Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), a terrorist movement operating in
the Southeast Asia. In particular, these data are related to the
Salafist extremist movement, founded by Aburajak Janjalani,
a native terrorist of the Southern Philippines in 1991. The net-
work is based on a data set accumulated over 20 years, from
1991 to 2011, and involves 247 individuals engaged in the
implementation of 108 kidnappings in Malaysia and the Philip-
pines. In particular, victims were essentially Filipino
businessmen, news reporters and Christian clergy members.
The data set, reconstructed using four open sources by Ger-
des et al. (2014), is a result of a collection process regarding
individuals involved in kidnappings, the date of the kidnap-
ping event, as well as the place and the context in which those
happened.
`Ndrangheta network.This network refers to the Calabrian
Mafia clan, the `Ndrangheta, which is based in the Reggio
Calabria region, in Southern Italy. However, police investi-
gations reported the evidence of the expansion of the
`Ndrangheta organisation even in the north of Italy and, in
particular, in the Lombardy region. The present network is
composed of 149 `Ndrangheta members participating in 47
internal meetings occurring between 2007 and 2009 in the
Lombardy region. Those meetings were mostly organised in
public places such as pubs and restaurants. Also, they had the
aim of solving internal problems, making important deci-
sions and identifying new affiliations (Calderoni, 2014). We
reconstructed the data set by utilising a judicial document
concerning the pretrial detention order produced by the pre-
liminary investigation judge of Milan. This act allows the
implementation of measures of custody and arrest warrants
for some people, identified such as `Ndrangheta's members.
Their identification is a result of a police investigation, called
`Operazione Infinito' (Infinite Operation), through which
investigators collected information about the evolution of the
`Ndrangheta structure organisation by wiretappings and
observations of the common participation in summits and
secret meetings. Although these meetings had meaningful
durations, most meetings would last less than 24 hours,
wherefore we deem the sequential nature more important
than duration dynamics (Table 1).
Revealing the individual engagement in covert
activities over time
In this section, we begin by representing the two-mode net-
work graphical representation for all three data sets. Two-
mode networks are showed in Figures 3(a), 4(a) and 5(a).
Blue squares correspond to events, whereas nodes with a
round shape in red refer to individuals. The labels indicate
individuals and events. Then, we depict the traditional social

network visualisation corresponding to the one-mode projec-
tion of those affiliation matrices. One-mode networks corre-
spond to Figures 3(b), 4(b) and 5(b). Here, the colour of
nodes reflects the individual's centrality: Darkest nodes are
the most central. The centrality is based on the basic measure
of the degree of a node that is equivalent to the number of
direct connections a node has (Borgatti et al., 2013). In this
case, an individual with a high degree corresponds to an indi-
vidual who has been engaged in covert activities with many
other participants. Finally, for each of the three data sets, we
report the bi-dynamic line-graph representation. Bi-dynamic
line-graphs are showed in Figures 3(c), 4(c) and 5(c). In
these representations, the colour of the nodes matches with
the respective one in the one-mode representations. On the
contrary, the number in the labels reflects the number of the
events considered. The events are displayed from left to
right, in a horizontal progression.
UK Suffragette co-participation in meetings and actions in Bristol
and Bath. Figure 3(a) shows the two-mode visualisation for the
Suffragettes participating in meetings and public protests in
Bristol and Bath, in the United Kingdom. Here, we notice that
only a handful of central individuals took part in many of these
events, whereas the large part of Suffragettes joined in only a
few protests, and sometimes even on their own, as the three
nodes located on the lower left side of the graph reveal. The
insight gained from Figure 3(b) is two-fold. First, the promi-
nence of two individuals, N1 and N30, in dark blue, is visible
due to the fact they attended numerous events. As a conse-
quence, in the one-mode projection, they result to be directly
connected to many other individuals. Second, it is possible to
identify the presence of a few clusters of individuals densely
connected to each other. This means that the Suffragettes did
not regularly attend all events, and the participation was spo-
radic. This latter characteristic of the graph seems to suggest
that Suffragettes were organised in subgroups whose members
used to attend meetings and perform violent attacks together.
However, the one-mode projection does not show the extent to
which the dynamics of the individual's participation over time
evolve. A better insight of those dynamics is captured by the
bi-dynamic line-graph, Figure 3(c).
In here, it can be seen that the general pattern of participa-
tion over time is delineated by a pair of individuals who were
present in many of the events reported. The flow of the
Suffragettes' participation can be distinguished in several
periods. During the first period, corresponding to the first 15
events, the direction of individual's participation presents a
certain linear polarisation around few key individuals.
Afterwards, during the second period, characterising the fol-
lowing 17 events, the participation evolves by presenting
three subgroups who led the mobilisation. Only few of these
individuals involved are still active members of the third
period, represented by the last eight events, whereas most of
them abandoned the campaign. At this point, the dynamic
line-graph shows a certain reorganisation in the Suffragettes'
mobilisation since only nine individuals appear to maintain a
commitment to the campaign. In addition, it seems that the
Suffragettes run the mobilisation by acting generally in two
separate subgroups. Almost at the end of the time window,
after the 30th event, only the individuals corresponding to
one of these subgroups continued its militancy in the
Suffragettes campaign. Interestingly, the number of mem-
bers who remained involved at that time is critically lower
than the beginning.
The major relevance of only few central people and the
presence of a quite stable tendency of the Suffragette's
engagement in events can be the consequence of either the
presence of a specific role's distinction of individuals in the
campaign and the general leadership's influence. It is known,
in fact, that Annie Kenney, who was employed as secretary
by the WSPU, assumed an important role for supporting the
expansion of the Suffragette movement in the West of
England, and in particular in Bristol and Bath. Ms. Kenney
was sustained and helped by Mary Blathwayt, albeit Ms.
Blathwayt refused to be highly involved in risky activity. The
prominence of Kenney and Blathwayt during the time is then
explained by the role they assumed in the Suffragette's cam-
paign. Their presence in many of the these events is also jus-
tified by the nature of events considered, which reflects
violent public demonstrations as well as private meetings
which were sometimes located at Blathwayt's house. The
leadership's influence, instead, may explain the decrease of
people's engagement in the campaign. Emmeline and
Christabel Pankhurst, in fact, leaders of the WSPU, influ-
enced the Suffragette's commitment in protests by restricting
their participation in actions. The decision of taking part in
violent attacks was most of the time a result of an internal
decision related to the strategy adopted by the Suffragette's
leadership rather than a personal decision. This aspect is par-
ticularly relevant since it goes against what ought to be the
intention of a social movement which is to engage the critical
mass and recruit people in support to their campaign. In our
opinion, the dynamic line-graph brings to light the relevance
of the leadership's influence much better than the other tradi-
tional social network representations since it reflects the
extent of the evolution of people's participation influenced
by the leadership of the Suffragette movement who used to
decide who was in and who was out during the campaign.
Philippines terrorist network.Figure 4(a) represents the two-
mode network of the Philippines terrorist network. In here,
the high density of individuals around some events (squares)
reveals that terrorists mostly act in partnerships. The two-
mode network representation also depicts separate compo-
nents which suggest the presence of autonomous groups of
terrorists. The one-mode projection of this two-mode network
is reported in Figure 4(b). This representation, which captures
the presence of disconnected components, seems also to high-
light the prominent position assumed by some individuals,
N41 and N103, belonging to the main component. Those
Broccatelli et al. 11
individuals have a relevant role in keeping the network con-
nected. However, neither of these representations are capable
of capturing the evolution of people's action history.
The bi-dynamic line-graph, depicted in Figure 4(c), better
reveals the story of the terrorists' tactics. Overall, terrorist
actions seemed to be accomplished by different terrorist
groups over time. This representation also suggests that the
individual's commitment to terrorist attacks is subject to
changes through time since the number of terrorists involved
each time rapidly increases and/or decreases. Terrorists have
been involved in the events progressively and have followed
different directions of actions. In other words, they mainly
tended to act separately. The general pattern of terrorists'
participation in terrorist attacks can be characterised by four
periods. During the first period, referring to the first 21
events, the presence of only one main trajectory of collective
action, with two small opposite branches can be noticed.
Only six of the terrorists involved in this period led the ter-
rorist propaganda during the second period. In this second
group of events, composed of the following 15 events, there
seemed to be a surge in terrorist activism. During this second
period, terrorists tended to act separately, mainly divided in
three groups until the last event of this period, number 36,
which represents the highest one in terms of the number of
people involved. Interestingly, many of the terrorists who
supported the propaganda until now finished their active
commitment during the third period. This third subgroup of
events, from event 37 until event 67, is generally character-
ised by a low level of individuals' engagement in action. In
addition, it can be noted that the flow of action mainly fol-
lows two trajectories of participation. Afterwards, during the
fourth period, corresponding to the remaining attacks, the
individual's commitment to terrorist attacks presents a fur-
ther decrease with, again, a certain tendency of acting sepa-
rately in three groups. In general, the bi-dynamic line-graph
depicts a high turnover of terrorists' engagement in actions
that contributes in keeping the flow of participation fluctuat-
ing and discontinuous. In addition, this flow is characterised
by the presence of key individuals who maintain certain
dynamics of continuity of collaboration among those differ-
ent periods.
The presence of those separated groups of terrorists per-
forming kidnappings can be explained by the characteristics
of the data set. Due to the difficulty in defining boundaries
among terrorist groups' members, it is possible that the iden-
tified terrorists were members of different terrorist groups.
As Gerdes et al. (2014) pointed out, in fact, the ASG used to
have close relationships with other terrorist groups such as
the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), the Southeast Asian terror group
responsible for the Bali bombing in 2002, and the Pentagon
Gang (PG), another radical organisation which used to per-
form kidnappings. Therefore, the network can be composed
by individuals who moved fluidly among several terrorist
organisations. However, the presence of a certain level of
flexibility in the participation dynamics characterising this
network might be explained by the criminal organisations'
necessity to adapt to new situations and to quickly re-config-
ure themselves in response to police authorities dismantling
efforts (Enders and Su, 2007; Milward and Raab, 2006). This
necessity can be on the basis of the evolving strategy of per-
forming kidnappings and of the way in which individuals
have been involved in these terrorist actions.
`Ndrangheta network.Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show, respec-
tively, the original `Ndrangheta Mafia network and its
one-mode representation. In this case, the difficulty in under-
standing the properties of the pattern of interaction only by
looking at these graphs is evident since these visualisations
do not suggest any particular pattern of interactions although
these could be better revealed by applying some SNA meas-
ures such as centrality. On the contrary, the bi-dynamic line-
graph, Figure 5(c), seems to give a better insight into the
internal dynamics of the Mafia organisation.
In general, in the flow of participation in Mafia summits,
we can distinguish two periods. During the first period,
corresponding to the first 28 meetings, it is noticeable that
Mafia members joined the organisation consistently and
mainly led to the presence of two distinguished subgroups
with two different trajectories of participation. In addition,
one of these two subgroups seemed to be characterised by a
further division in two separate branches. Afterwards, during
the second period concerning all the succeeding events, the
presence of four different directions of action may be seen.
Notwithstanding that, a certain tendency of clustering seems
to appear during the last event since Mafia members belong-
ing to these different subgroups took part in the meeting
together.
The added understanding of the pattern of interactions
that the bi-dynamic line-graph provides may be further
emphasised using the background information provided by
the police investigation. As far as it has been reported in
the document from where data have been extracted, the
`Ndrangheta Mafia organisation presented a hierarchical
structure with small satellite groups, called locali. Each
locale, similarly hierarchically structured, had the aim to
manage its specific territorial area. Bosses and individuals
with certain roles from a locale were expected, in most
cases, to take part in meetings and summits organised from
another locale in order to honour the commitments
assumed. We surmise that the distinction between mem-
bers mainly involved at local level and others related,
instead, at the general level of the whole Lombardy terri-
tory can explain the people's tendency of organising sepa-
rated meetings. Moreover, the original police report offers
some information about the nature and the content of the
meetings. Therefore, this information helps in the compre-
hension of the relevance of the two events, one in the mid-
dle of the time window and one at the end. The first general
summit, meeting number 28, organised on the 20th of
January 2009 in a restaurant located in Cardano al Campo,
12 Methodological Innovations
in the province of Varese, in Lombardy, had been organ-
ised in order to discuss a new ordering of the leadership
structure due to the murder of the former Mafia's Lombardy
boss. The second relevant meeting, number 47 at the end of
the time window, had been organised on the 31st of October
2009 at the residential care `Falcone e Borsellino' in
Paderno Dugnano, in the province of Milan. Here, the most
influent Mafia members proceeded with the election of the
new `Ndrangheta boss in Lombardy and discussed the
future guidelines of the `Ndrangheta organisation in north-
ern Italy. The content of these two events can explain the
presence of changes in the evolving pattern of interactions
depicted by the bi-dynamic line-graph. Therefore, we pre-
sume that the pattern of participation's flow reflects the
necessity of the Mafia leadership structure reorganisation
and the way in which Mafia members reinforced their
membership and reciprocal trust.
Conclusion
We extended the use of the line-graph to bipartite networks
in order to analyse temporal dynamics. Our work was based
on the use of a line-graph projection for bipartite network
with the application of a reduction criterion of redundant
ties. Our method not only provided a better visualisation of
temporal dynamics, but it also captured the temporal proxim-
ity between individuals, that is, the presence of overlapping
relationships and the individuals'trajectories of participation
in events.
We sought to explore the power of this visualisation by
applying it to three longitudinal covert networks. For each
network, we compared the bi-dynamic line-graph with two
traditional social network visualisations: the two-mode net-
work format and the one-mode network resulting from the
conversion of the two-mode. By referring to previous publi-
cations (Crossley et al., 2012; Calderoni, 2014; Edwards,
2014; Gerdes et al., 2014) and the original document from
which the Mafia's data set has been reconstructed (Infinite
Operation), we provided some narrative explanations about
the tendencies of people's trajectories of actions brought to
the light by the bi-dynamic line-graph.
These representations seemed to offer a better image of
the rate of individuals' turnover participating in covert
actions over time without arbitrarily distinguishing the whole
time window in temporally adjacent intervals. The diversity
and/or similarity of people's trajectories of actions over time
have been revealed through this representation and research-
ers could have a better insight concerning the pattern of these
interactions over time. Furthermore, beside the information
about individual's centrality within people's trajectories of
actions, the bi-dynamic line-graph also helped in understand-
ing which events had been more relevant since they indicated
the exact moment in which individuals started to act differ-
ently resulting in a noticeable change in the patterning of
social interactions.
Thinking in terms of the relevance of events opens up the
important question of the duality of events (Breiger, 1974).
This idea of duality emphasises the intrinsic dualism present
between individuals and events. If, on the one hand, indi-
viduals become linked to each other due to their common
involvement in the same social event, on the other hand, a
similar link exists among events when characterised by com-
mon people's participation. In this second case, the linkage
among events can rely upon the specific meaning of the
events (Diani, 2015). Individuals co-participating in events,
in fact, not only share person-to-person interactions but they
also assign a specific meaning to the events in which they
took place. By looking at the structure of the bi-dynamic
line-graph, events acquire a central importance when they
happen at and define a crucial point in time, that is, a water-
shed. Leading up to and after this watershed, individuals
became involved in the actions differently during the time
and changes in the organisational network dynamics can be
registered. The bi-dynamic line-graph seems to capture the
aspect of the duality of events since it reveals not only who
are the prominent individuals whose trajectories of action
increase network connectivity but also at which point in time
this network connectivity rises and respectively to which
event. Therefore, the events can be seen such as a chain of
connected activities over time linked together by people
attending those activities. The link between individual histo-
ries of participation in action and the community network
structure as it is provided by the bi-dynamic line-graph can
be the basis of a further development of a relational model
for collective action for investigating how individuals
became involved in different types of events over time and to
what extent.
Beside the advantages, as has been pointed out above in
the section related to the description of the proposed model,
the bi-dynamic line-graph presented some limitations. First,
the different space in time existing between occurred events
has not been considered in this representation. A next step
would be the development of a specific visualisation tool in
order to improve the visualisation of temporal dynamics, in
particular by removing overlapping people's trajectories and
taking into account the temporal distance between each event
by considering the exact point in time in which these events
occurred. Second, the set of standard SNA measures cur-
rently in existence were not applicable. Due to the fact that
the bi-dynamic line matrices contain two sets of ties, directed
and reciprocal, the SNA measures need to be specifically
adjusted before being applied for analysing some formal
properties of these graphs. Thus, we plan to extend the use of
the bi-dynamic line-graphs by providing analytical solutions
for quantifying the centrality of individuals in virtue of their
position in the channels of latent knowledge and expertise.
This different measure of centrality will quantify the level of
expertise individuals accumulated by participating in activi-
ties over time and the amount of shared knowledge individu-
als achieved by working and acting cooperatively and
Broccatelli et al. 13
consistently with others. In such a context, we hope to gener-
ate new insights into the understanding of who the key actors
are, who contributed the most to the spread of knowledge
and expertise in the given covert networks.
