Serum Uric Acid Concentration in US Men and Women
Xiang Gao, Lu Qi, Ning Qiao, Hyon K. Choi, Gary Curhan, Katherine L. Tucker, Alberto Ascherio
Abstract--Fructose-induced hyperuricemia might have a causal role in metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and other
chronic disease. However, no study has investigated whether sugar added to foods or sugar-sweetened beverages, which
are major sources of fructose, are associated with serum uric acid concentration in free-living populations. We examined
the relationship between the intakes of added sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages and serum uric acid concentrations
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001­2002, a nationally representative sample of men and
women. We included 4073 subjects (1988 men and 2085 women) 18 years of age in the current study. Dietary intake
was assessed by a single 24-hour recall. We used multivariate linear regression to adjust for age, gender, intake of energy
and alcohol, body mass index, use of diuretics, -blockers, and other covariates. Male subjects in the highest intake
quartile of estimated intake of added sugars or sugar-sweetened drinks had higher plasma uric acid concentrations than
those in the lowest intake quartiles (P0.001 for both) after adjusting for potential confounders, whereas we did not
observe significant associations for females (P for trend0.2; P for interaction 0.01). Further research is needed to
confirm causality of these associations and the observed difference by gender. (Hypertension. 2007;50:306-312.)

 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Increasing consumption of fructose has coincided with the
increasing incidence of obesity and the metabolic syn-
drome over the past 2 decades.1 Unlike glucose and other
sugars, fructose intake raises serum uric acid, presumably
through induction of catabolism of nucleotides or reduction
of uric acid excretion.2­4 Meanwhile, a growing body of
evidence has demonstrated an association of hyperuricemia
with hypertension, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance,
obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease.5­9 Animal
studies have suggested a possible causal role of fructose on
hypertension10­12 and metabolic syndrome,4,13 whereas hy-
peruricemia induced by greater fructose intake could be an
important mechanism underlying the associations.11,13
In the United States, the largest single source of fructose in
the diet is from added sugars, accounting for approximately
two thirds of total fructose intake according to the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­
2000.14,15 Added sugars are sugars and syrups that are not
naturally present in foods, including sugar, corn syrup, and
high-fructose corn syrup, which are added to foods during
processing or preparation.16,17 Half of added sugars consumed
in the United States were in the form of high-fructose corn
syrup, a major sweetener in sugar-sweetened beverages (soft
drinks and fruit drinks).14,18 The NHANES 1999­2000
showed that sweetened soft drinks were the number 1 energy
contributor in the United States. Soft drinks and fruit drinks
together provided 10.6% of estimated total energy, followed
by sweetened pastries (3.6%) and hamburgers (3.1%).14
However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated
whether added sugar in foods or sugar-sweetened beverages
is associated with serum uric acid concentration in free-living
populations.
Therefore, we examined the relationship between reported
intakes of added sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages and
serum uric acid concentrations in the NHANES 2001­2002.
Because earlier evidence has suggested that sex hormones
may modulate the metabolic response induced by fruc-
tose,19,20 we also examined this relationship by gender.
Subjects and Methods
Subjects
Subjects were 4994 men and women aged 18 years from the
NHANES 2001­2002. As we did previously,21,22 we excluded the
following subjects: (1) those who were pregnant (n309); (2) those
who reported energy intake 2.5 MJ/d (600 kcal/d) or 16.7 MJ/d
(4000 kcal/d; n334); and (3) those who did not have a serum uric
acid measurement (n245). We also excluded subjects who reported
use of drugs affecting uric acid (allopurinol or uricosuric agents,
n33). We, therefore, included 4073 subjects (1988 men and 2085

intake is commonly used in nutritional epidemiologic studies,23,24
because implausible reported energy intake suggest likely inaccurate
estimation of other dietary exposure intakes, ie, added sugar or
drinks in this case.
Assessment of Dietary Intakes and Covariates
In the NHANES 2001­2002, dietary intake was measured with a
single 24-hour recall from each participant. Data were available from
2 data sets: individual food files25 which provided nutrient data (eg,
total energy and alcohol), and pyramid servings intake data for
NHANES,26 which provided standard serving size information for 5
major pyramid food groups (grains, dairy, fruit, vegetables, meat,
and beans), as well as added sugar and discretionary fat (ie, excess
fat). Details about calculation of added sugar are described
elsewhere.27
Information on age, gender, race/ethnicity, body measurements
(including weight and height), smoking status, vitamin and mineral
supplement use, medication use (including diuretics, -blockers,
aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and medical
conditions (including self-reported diabetes) was collected by self-
report. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kilo-
grams)/height (meters)2. Subjects who had smoked 100 cigarettes
in their lifetimes were considered never smokers; subjects who had
smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes were considered former
smokers if they answered negatively to the question, "Do you smoke
now?" and current smokers if they answered affirmatively.28 Sub-
jects were identified as having diabetes if they reported that they had
diabetes or that they used medications for diabetes (insulin or oral
medicines). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure
140 mm Hg, and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, and/or
use of medicine for hypertension.
Serum Uric Acid Measurement
Serum uric acid concentrations were measured with a Beckman
Synchron LX20 using a timed end point method. Uric acid is
oxidized by uricase to produce allantoin and hydrogen peroxide. The
hydrogen peroxide reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine and 3,5-dichloro-
2-hydroxybenzene sulfonate in a reaction catalyzed by peroxidase to
produce a colored product. The system monitors the change in
absorbance at 520 nm at a fixed time interval. The change in
absorbance is directly proportional to the concentration of uric acid
in the sample.29
Statistical Analyses
All of the statistical analyses were performed with SUDAAN,
version 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute) using techniques appropri-
ate to the complex survey design of NHANES 2001­2002. All of the
analyses used NHANES 2001­2002 sample weights so that results
are representative of the US community-dwelling population. All of
the P values are 2 sided. Dietary variables were analyzed in quartiles
of the whole population. This conservative approach has the advan-
tage that it greatly reduces the chance that a small number of extreme
observations will have undue influence on the results. Because a
large proportion of subjects did not report sugar-sweetened drinks or
fruit juice, we assigned them into the lowest intake quartile. We then
evenly divided the rest subjects into 3 categories based on reported
intakes and treated them as quartiles 2 to 4. A linear regression
model was used to evaluate associations between dietary variables
and serum uric acid. Linear trends were tested for significance by
using the median value for each quartile of intake and treating this
value as a continuous variable. We adjusted for age (year), gender,
smoking (never, past, current: 1 to 14 or 15 cigarettes per day),
BMI, ethnicity, hypertension (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), intake of
total energy (megajoules per day), alcohol (grams per day), dietary
vitamin C (milligrams per day), fruit (servings per day), vegetables
(servings per day), meat and seafood (servings per day), whole grains
(servings per day), and use of antioxidant supplements (vitamin E,
vitamin C, and carotenoids), -blockers, or diuretics (each yes/no).
We also examined whether correlations of added sugar and
sweetened drink intakes with serum uric acid were modified by
gender, alcohol (none versus 0 g/d), smoking status (never versus
ever), and BMI (25 versus 25 kg/m2). To test these correlations,
we included multiplicative terms in the linear regression models with
adjustment for other potential confounders. To examine robustness
of the results, we conducted sensitivity analyses by excluding
subjects with hypertension or diabetes. Because losartan has been
shown in humans to decrease serum uric acid30 and to prevent
fructose-induced hypertension in the rat model,31 we also did a
sensitivity analysis excluding subjects who reported use of losartan.
Results
There was a 10-fold difference in the median added sugar
intake between the highest and lowest quartiles (Table 1).
Those with the greatest added sugar intakes tended to be
younger, male, and current smokers; were less likely to have
diabetes and hypertension; were less likely to report use of
antioxidant supplements or the assessed antihypertensive
medicines; and had higher intakes of total energy and meat
and lower intakes of fruit and alcohol relative to those in the
lowest intake quartile.
Subjects with the highest added sugar intake had signifi-
cantly higher serum uric acid concentrations relative to those
with the lowest intake quartile (329 versus 317 mol/L;
P0.05), after adjustment for smoking; BMI; intake of total
energy, dairy, and alcohol; hypertension; and other potential
confounders (Table 2). Exclusion of participants with diabe-
tes or hypertension did not change the associations (P for
trend 0.05 for both). Similar significant associations were
seen after excluding subjects who reported use of losartan
(data not shown). Consistent with the results on added sugars,
subjects in the highest sweetened drinks intake category had
significantly higher serum uric acid relative to those in the
lowest intake category; the difference in uric acid concentra-
tion was 22 mol/L (P0.0006). We further examined
associations between intakes of 2 major sugar-sweetened
drinks, soft drinks and fruit drinks, and serum uric acid. We
found a significant positive association for soft drinks (P for
trend0.002) but not for fruit drinks (P for trend0.30).
There was no significant relationship between fruit juice
intake and serum uric acid. We further examined the associ-
ations between intake of citrus juice and noncitrus juice and
serum uric acid, but neither was significant. Intake of apples
and pears, which are rich sources of naturally occurring
fructose, was also not significantly associated with serum uric
acid (data not shown). Further adjustment for coffee intake
did not materially change any of the findings.
Because sex hormones may modulate the metabolic re-
sponse induced by fructose, we further explored possible
interactions of added sugar or beverage intake with gender in
relation to serum uric acid concentrations. Associations
between added sugar or beverage intake and plasma uric acid
concentration were significantly modified by gender (P for
interaction 0.01 for both). Greater intake of added sugar or
sweetened drinks was significantly associated with plasma
uric acid among men (P for trend0.0008 for added sugar
and 0.0003 for sweetened drinks) but not among women (P
for trend 0.2 for both; Figure). We did not see significant
associations between intakes of apples and pears or of fruit
juice and serum uric acid concentrations in men (P for trend
Gao et al Uric Acid and Added Sugar 307
0.1 for both). No significant interactions were found with
age, smoking status, or BMI (P for interaction 0.05 for all)
compared with serum uric acid.
Discussion
In this national sample of men and women, we found that
greater intake of added sugars or sugar-sweetened drinks was
associated with higher plasma uric acid concentration in men
but not in women (P for interaction 0.01). Intake of fruit
juice, which contains a large amount of naturally occurring
sugar, was not associated with plasma uric acid.
These findings could have important clinical and public
health implications. High serum uric acid has been suggested
as a possible risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syn-
drome, and cardiovascular disease, independent of the tradi-
tional risk factors.4,7,32 Associations between hyperuricemia
and hypertension have been reported in several studies.33­35
Prospective data within 1 study indicated that hyperuricemia
precedes onset of hypertension.34 Several studies, in vivo and
in vitro, have examined the pathophysiological links between
hyperuricemia and hypertension. Hyperuricemia has been
associated with higher renal vascular and total peripheral
resistances.36 In 1 study, uric acid infusion in humans led to
impaired endothelial NO release, which was reversed by
allopurinol, which inhibits uric acid production.5 Hyperurice-
mia may also increase salt retention.37 In addition, elevated
uric acid concentration is associated with insulin resistance,
high triglyceride levels, and chronic inflammation,4­6,8,38,39
all of which may affect the development of hypertension.40,41
On the other hand, consumption of added sugars, especially
high-fructose corn syrup, has been increasing rapidly during
the past few decades in the United States. Economic disap-
pearance data have shown that, from 1970 to 2000, the
average intake of added sugars increased from  64 to 80
kg/y per person, whereas high-fructose corn syrup has in-
creased 100-fold, from 0.3 to 33 kg/y per person.1,15
However, because economic disappearance data come from
measuring the amount of all the foods that were produced or
imported and then subtracting all the nonfood uses, consump-
tion of added sugars could be overestimated. Using the same

NHANES data, we have shown previously that careful
restriction of added sugar and fat intake is a key for
maintenance of appropriate energy intake of Americans.22
Our findings that greater intake of foods with high-fructose
content correlates with elevated concentrations of uric acid
are consistent with a recent animal study in which high-
fructose intake induced elevated blood pressure and metabol-
ic syndrome in rats; these effects were partially prevented by
administration of allopurinol, which lowered serum uric
acid.4 Several animal studies have demonstrated that fructose
has a pathogenetic role in hypertension: overloaded fructose
may cause hypertension,10­12,31 whereas a high-fructose diet
increased mortality in hypertensive rats.42 Associations be-
tween intakes of added sugar and sugar-sweetened drinks and
serum uric acid are also consistent with previous trials,43­47
where the administration of a high dose of fructose, either
intravenously or orally, led to increases in serum uric acid
concentration.
Use of ATP in the phosphorylation of fructose and seques-
tration of phosphate in fructose-1-phosphate could be an
underlying mechanism by which greater intake of added
sugar, especially of high-fructose corn syrup in sweetened
drinks, is associated with high serum uric acid concentra-
tions.2 ATP and phosphate are inhibitors of enzymes of
adenine nucleotide degradation (eg, 5-nucleotidase and
adenosine monophosphate deaminase). Removal of this inhi-
bition, may, therefore, increase the generation of uric acid.2
Greater intake of fructose has also been shown to decrease
uric acid excretion because of an association with increased
lactate production.4
Fructose-induced metabolic abnormalities could be another
reason for hyperuricemia. Greater intake of fructose or

sucrose could stimulate long-chain fatty acid synthesis and
lead to hypertriglyceridemia2 and increased insulin resis-
tance.48 Hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance have
been shown to be associated with high serum uric acid
concentration.49­51
We found that added sugar intake was significantly asso-
ciated with greater serum uric acid in men but not in women,
which is consistent with the experimental observation that
fructose feeding only leads to hypertension in male rats.19,52
This could be because of differences in sex hormones,
because fructose-induced hypertension in male rats was
prevented by estrogen treatment,19 whereas ovariectomy of
female rats had higher blood pressure when fed with fructose,
relative to ovary-intact rats.52 Several human studies reported
a modest hypouricemic effect of estrogen,53,54 which may be
because of increased uricosuria.53 Purine nucleotide metabo-
lism is affected by testosterone. Animal studies showed that
castration of male rats decreased synthesis of nucleotides,
guanosine monophosphate, and adenosine monophosphate
and nucleotide catabolism, which was restored by adminis-
tration of testosterone.55,56 In a sample of obese children aged
10 to 16 years, Denzer et al57 reported a significant positive
association between plasma testosterone and uric acid con-
centrations. Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated
gender differences in uric acid transporters, such as urate
transporter 1 and organic anion transport.58 The expression of
these transporters is higher in male mice than in female mice.
Therefore, male mice have a higher reabsorption of uric acid
than female mice. Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have
shown that dietary fructose was associated with disadvanta-
geous plasma lipid profiles in men but not in women.59,60 A
series of animal studies has demonstrated that effects of
fructose on plasma insulin and insulin resistance differed by
gender.19,52 Fructose feeding had a deteriorative effect only in
male rats but not in female rats. As discussed above, blood
lipid and insulin status are associated with serum uric acid.
These data, together with our study, suggest that sex hor-
mones or other gender-related factors may influence fructose
or uric acid metabolism. However, exact mechanisms under-

tose and uric acid remain to be elucidated. Further investiga-
tion of these may increase our understanding of uric acid
metabolism.
We did not observe a significant association between
intake of fruit juice, a major source of naturally occurring
fructose, and serum uric acid concentrations. One could
speculate that fruit juice is also a good source of antioxidants,
including vitamin C and carotenoids. Vitamin C has been
shown to have an uricosuric effect, ie, increasing uric acid
excretion.61,62 These components could offset the deleterious
effects of fructose. Another possible explanation for this
discrepancy is that, in the current population, variation in fruit
juice intake was smaller than that of sugar-sweetened drink
intake; the difference between the 2 extreme fruit juice intake
quartiles was 2.7 servings per day relative to 5.7 servings per
day of sugar-sweetened drinks.
Our study has several limitations. We cannot claim cau-
sality because of the cross-sectional nature of this study.
Subjects may change their diets because of conditions related
to elevated serum uric acid concentrations. However, we
obtained similar significant associations after exclusion of
those with hypertension or diabetes. A single 24-hour recall
was used to assess dietary intake. This method may not
accurately estimate the true variation in added sugar intake in
the population. Furthermore, it cannot capture the long-term
dietary intake pattern for each subject because of high
day-to-day variation. The resulting misclassification in expo-
sure measurement may lead to an inaccurate estimation of the
associations between added sugars and serum uric acid.
Perspectives
We found positive associations between intake of added
sugar and sweetened drinks and serum uric acid concentration
in men but not in women. If the association is causal, it could
imply a potential method to prevent certain chronic diseases,
such as gout and cardiovascular disease. In addition, an
individual with high dietary fructose intake might need closer
screening for the onset of cardiovascular disease. Associa-
tions of intake of added sugar and sweetened drinks with
serum uric acid and possibly with hypertension and metabolic
syndrome are needed to be confirmed by well-designed
clinical trials. Further research is also needed to understand
the differences in association between hyperuricemia and
high dietary intake of fructose in men and women.
