The role of cannabis and endocannabinoids in appetite regulation has been extensively studied, but the asso-
ciation of cannabis use with weight in the general population is not known. The authors used data from 2 repre-
sentative epidemiologic studies of US adults aged 18 years or older, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions (NESARC; 2001­2002) and the National Comorbidity Survey­Replication (NCS-R;
2001­2003), to estimate the prevalence of obesity as a function of cannabis use. The adjusted prevalences of
obesity in the NESARC and the NCS-R were 22.0% and 25.3%, respectively, among participants reporting no use
of cannabis in the past 12 months and 14.3% and 17.2%, respectively, among participants reporting the use
of cannabis at least 3 days per week. These differences were not accounted for by tobacco smoking status.
Additionally, after adjustment for sex and age, the use of cannabis was associated with body mass index differ-
ences in both samples. The authors conclude that the prevalence of obesity is lower in cannabis users than in
nonusers.

In 2007­2008, the prevalence of obesity was 33.9% among
adults in the United States (1), contributing to 13% of total
US mortality (2). Clinical guidelines for obesity treatment
recommend lifestyle approaches, including the promotion
of physical activity and a healthy diet (3). Pharmacologic
treatment may be appropriate to facilitate weight loss in pa-
tients with a body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2)
greater than 30 or patients with a BMI greater than 27 in
the presence of coexisting conditions. Seven drugs are cur-
rently approved for the treatment of obesity in the United
States. Their mechanisms of action are based on elevating
monoamine levels or lipase inhibition in the gastrointestinal
tract.
The role of cannabis and endocannabinoids in appetite reg-
ulation has been extensively studied in the past 10 years (4).
Rimonabant, a selective antagonist/inverse agonist of the can-
nabinoid CB1 receptor, was approved in more than 30 coun-
tries for the treatment of obesity in 2006 but was withdrawn
several years later because of safety concerns. Thereafter, the
commercial development of other cannabinoid CB1 receptor
antagonists was stopped (5, 6). Based on the fact that canna-
bis use increases appetite, clinical trials have suggested that
cannabis derivatives may be a useful treatment for anorexia
and weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency
virus infection (7, 8).
Tobacco use and smoking cessation have been associated
with weight loss (9) and weight gain (10), respectively. Al-
though some investigators have examined the relation between
cannabis use and obesity in small samples, no large-scale study
has evaluated the association of cannabis use with weight
in the general adult population. Therefore, we estimated
the prevalence of obesity as a function of cannabis use in
2 representative national epidemiologic studies: the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions
(NESARC) (11) and the National Comorbidity Survey­
Replication (NCS-R) (12). We hypothesized that the prev-
alence of obesity would be higher in cannabis users than in
nonusers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
We analyzed cross-sectional data on 2 population-based
nationally representative samples, the NESARC participants
(11) and the NCS-R participants (12). These studies have been
described extensively in previous reports (11­14). Both studies
involved face-to-face surveys of US residents aged 18 years
or older from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population.
The NESARC was a survey of 43,093 respondents (re-
sponse rate ¼ 81%) conducted by the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism from 2001 to 2002. The NCS-
R was an independent survey of 9,282 respondents (response
rate ¼ 73.0%) conducted by the National Institute of Mental
Health (Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys)
from 2001 to 2003.
Measures
Current cannabis use. In the NESARC, the frequency of
cannabis use in the preceding 12 months among users was
assessed with the question, ``During the last 12 months, about
how often did you use marijuana?'' There were 7 possible
answers: 1) every day; 2) 5­6 days per week; 3) 3­4 days per
week; 4) 1­2 days per week; 5) 2­3 days per month; 6) once
a month or less; and 7) no use in the past 12 months.
In the NCS-R, the frequency of cannabis use in the pre-
ceding 12 months among users was assessed with the ques-
tion, ``On average, how often in the past 12 months have you
used marijuana or hashish?'' There were 9 possible answers:
1) daily; 2) almost daily (3­6 times per week); 3) 1­2 days
per week; 4) several times per month (25­51 days per year);
5) 1­2 times per month (12­24 days per year); 6) every other
month or so (6­11 days per year); 7) 3­5 days in the past
12 months; 8) 1­2 days in the past 12 months; and 9) no use
in the past 12 months.
On the basis of responses to these 2 similar questions, re-
spondents were grouped into 4 categories of cannabis use to
increase consistency across the 2 studies: 1) no use in the
last 12 months; 2) at least once a year but less than once
a month; 3) from once a month or more to twice per week;
and 4) from 3 days per week to every day.
BMI and obesity. Data on self-reported height and weight
were available from 41,654 respondents in the NESARC and
from 9,106 respondents in the NCS-R. BMI was calculated
by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in
meters. Participants were considered obese if their BMI was
30.0 or greater (n ¼ 9,879 in the NESARC; n ¼ 2,283 in the
NCS-R). We used BMI as a continuous outcome for the linear
regression analysis examining the relation between frequency
of cannabis use and BMI. For all other analyses, we consid-
ered obesity as a categorical outcome (30 vs. <30).
Tobacco smoking. For both study samples, cigarette
smoking in the past 12 months was coded into 3 categories:
1) current smoker, defined as someone who currently smoked
cigarettes daily or occasionally; 2) ex-smoker, defined as
a tobacco nonuser who previously was a daily or occasional
smoker; and 3) never smoker, defined as a nonuser who had
never used any tobacco.
Other measures. We also considered sociodemographic
characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, educational
level, and marital status, as well as the use of other drugs
in the past 12 months.
In both the NESARC and the NCS-R, age at interview
was categorized into 4 groups: 18­29, 30­44, 45­64, and 65
years. Marital status was classified as married/common-law
married; widowed, divorced, or separated; or never married.
Educational level was classified as less than high school,
high school graduate, or some college or higher. Region of
residence was classified as Northeast, Midwest, South, or
West.
Coding of race/ethnicity differed between the 2 samples.
In the NESARC, race/ethnicity was categorized as white,
black, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/
Latino, or American Indian/Alaska Native. In the NCS-R,
race/ethnicity was categorized as white, black, Asian, His-
panic/Latino, or other (including American Indian/Pacific
Islander).
In the NESARC, participants were asked whether they
had used sedatives, tranquilizers, opiates, heroin, amphet-
amine, cocaine/crack, hallucinogens, or an inhaler in the past
12 months. In the NCS-R, participants were asked whether
they had used cocaine/crack or any other drug in the past
12 months. In both samples, drug use in the past 12 months
was categorized as either no use of other drugs (except
tobacco and alcohol) or use of other drugs.
Statistical analyses
We first conducted univariate descriptive analyses for the
cohorts' characteristics across the 4 groups defined according
to the frequency of cannabis use in the past year (no use in the
last 12 months, at least once a year but less than once a month,
at least once a month to twice per week, and 3 days per week
to every day). We used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel v2
statistic to examine the statistical significance of differences
observed with categorical dependent variables. The thresh-
old for statistical significance was P < 0.05. This analysis
was repeated including only the participants who had never
smoked tobacco.
We then fitted a logistic regression model with obesity as
a categorical outcome and the frequency of cannabis use in
the past year as the primary association of interest. We ad-
justed for sex and age in our first model and for sex, age, race/
ethnicity, educational level, marital status, region of resi-
dence, and smoking status in our second model. These co-
variates were chosen because they were associated with the
dependent variable in the bivariate analysis. Goodness of fit
was determined by means of the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.
We fitted a linear regression model with BMI as the outcome;
use of cannabis, as well as frequency of cannabis use in the
past year, was the primary association of interest, adjusting
for sex and age.
For all analyses, data were weighted to reflect national
population estimates. Results were analyzed using SUDAAN
software, version 10.01 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina), to adjust for the complex
sampling design.

RESULTS
Of the 50,736 eligible respondents (41,633 in the
NESARC; 9,103 in the NCS-R), 4.0% of the participants
in the NESARC and 7.3% of the participants in the NCS-R
reported having used cannabis at least once in the past
12 months (see Table 1 and Web Table 1 (http://aje.oxford-
journals.org/)). The prevalence of obesity was significantly
lower in cannabis users than in nonusers (16.1% vs. 22.0% in
the NESARC (P < 0.001) and 17.2% vs. 25.3% in the NCS-R
(P < 0.001)).
The proportion of obese participants decreased with the
frequency of cannabis use (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel v2
test: P < 0.001 in both samples). The prevalence of obesity
in NESARC participants who reported no cannabis use in
the past 12 months was 22.0%, but it was only 14.3% in
participants who used cannabis ``3 days per week or more''
(percentages are weighted and adjusted for the survey de-
sign). Similarly, the prevalence of obesity in NCS-R partic-
ipants who reported no cannabis use in the past 12 months
was 25.3%, but it was only 17.2% in participants who used
cannabis ``3 days per week or more.'' In both samples, the odds

Obesity and Cannabis Use 931

ratio for obesity was significantly lower for all groups of
cannabis users than for persons who had not used cannabis
in the last 12 months, except for the subgroup of NCS-R
participants who used cannabis ``once a month to 2 days per
week'' (Table 2).
When a regression analysis was used to control for the
confounding effects of age and sex, the odds ratio for obe-
sity in the NESARC sample was significantly lower for all
groups of cannabis users than for participants who had not
smoked cannabis in the last 12 months (Table 2). The same
regression analysis in the NCS-R sample showed that when
controlling for the confounding effects of sex and age, the
odds ratio for obesity was significantly lower in the group of
participants using cannabis ``more than once a year but less
than once a month'' than in those who had not used cannabis
in the last 12 months.
Given that tobacco smoking affects weight, we conducted
supplementary analysis taking into account this effect. These
analyses did not affect the significance of the results (see Web
Appendix). We also took pregnancy into account, without
any effect on the results (Web Appendix).
DISCUSSION
This cross-sectional analysis indicated that despite the
evidence that cannabis use stimulates appetite in clinical
trials and laboratory studies, cannabis users are actually less
likely to be obese than nonusers in the general population.
Numerous cross-sectional and prospective studies have
examined the association between BMI or obesity and the
use of several substances of abuse, including alcohol (15­18),
tobacco (10, 19, 20), and illegal substances (21­24). The only
clear (and negative) relation between the frequency of use of
a substance and body weight that has emerged so far has been
for tobacco.
Three studies have specifically examined the relation
between cannabis use and obesity (25­27). A study of 297
females suggested that the rate of cannabis use in the last
12 months is lower in obese subjects than in subjects with
a lower BMI (25). A second study showed that frequent
use of cannabis was associated with obesity in girls in a
nationally representative sample of 7,885 adolescents (26).
A third study showed that use of cannabis is associated with
a higher caloric intake but is not associated with a higher
BMI (27).
Our results should be interpreted in the context of several
limitations. Firstly, information on cannabis use, height, and
weight was based on self-reports and was not confirmed by
direct measurement. Self-reports tend to underestimate BMI
(28, 29) but are unlikely to influence conclusions about asso-
ciations, since they are unlikely to be related to cannabis use.
Furthermore, the adjustments made for sociodemographic
characteristics in our study further decreased the risk of mis-
classification (29, 30). Secondly, physical activity and diet
are 2 major risk factors for obesity but were not taken into
account in this study. Despite these limitations, this analysis
showed that even if cannabis consumption increases appe-
tite, people using cannabis are less likely to be obese than
people who do not use cannabis.
