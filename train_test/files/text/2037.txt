Respiratory Impairment in Middle-Aged Persons

BACKGROUND: The lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method calculates the lower limit of normal for
spirometric values as the 5th percentile of the distribution of Z scores. Conceptually, LMS-derived
Z scores account for normal age-related changes in pulmonary function, including variability and
skewness in reference data. Evidence is limited, however, on whether the LMS method is valid for
evaluating respiratory impairment in middle-aged persons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associ-
ation of LMS-defined respiratory impairment (airflow limitation and restrictive pattern) with
mortality and respiratory symptoms. METHODS: We analyzed spirometric data from white par-
ticipants ages 45­64 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III, n  1,569) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC, n  8,163).
RESULTS: LMS-defined airflow limitation was significantly associated with mortality (adjusted
hazard ratios: NHANES III 1.90, 95% CI 1.32­2.72, ARIC 1.28, 95% CI 1.06­1.57), and respira-
tory symptoms (adjusted odds ratios: NHANES III 2.48, 95% CI 1.75­3.51, ARIC 2.27, 95% CI
1.98­2.62). LMS-defined restrictive-pattern was also significantly associated with mortality (ad-
justed hazard ratios: NHANES III 1.98, 95% CI 1.08­3.65, ARIC 1.38, 95% CI 1.03­1.85), and
respiratory symptoms (adjusted odds ratios: NHANES III 2.34, 95% CI 1.44­3.80, ARIC 1.89,
95% CI 1.46­2.45). CONCLUSIONS: In white middle-age persons, LMS-defined airflow limitation
and restrictive-pattern were significantly associated with mortality and respiratory symptoms.
Consequently, an approach that reports spirometric values based on LMS-derived Z scores might
provide an age-appropriate and clinically valid strategy for evaluating respiratory impairment. Key
words: spirometry; airflow limitation; restrictive-pattern; mortality; respiratory symptoms. [Respir Care

Introduction
In aging populations, because of widespread and cumu-
lative exposure to tobacco smoke, respiratory infections,
occupational dust, and air pollution, the evaluation of re-
spiratory impairment has clinical and epidemiological im-
plications.1-4 Most often, respiratory impairment is estab-
lished spirometrically, as airflow limitation (eg, COPD or
asthma) and restrictive-pattern (eg, thoracic kyphosis, heart
failure, or interstitial lung disease).5,6 Importantly, to min-
imize misidentification of respiratory impairment and to
better inform clinical decision making, it is imperative that

spirometric diagnostic thresholds consider normal age-related
changes in pulmonary function and health outcomes.6-14
Developmentally, after achieving peak pulmonary func-
tion at about 20 years of age, spirometry values progres-
sively decrease with age, principally due to increasing
rigidity of the chest wall and decreasing elastic recoil of
the lung.7-10 In addition, between-subject differences in
spirometric performance also increases progressively in
adults, starting at about age 30 years.8,9 Accordingly, to
account for normal age-related changes in pulmonary func-
tion, the lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) method has been pro-
posed as a basis for establishing spirometric diagnostic
thresholds.8,9 Specifically, the LMS method calculates the
lower limit of normal as the 5th percentile of the distribu-
tion of Z scores (LMS LLN5
), analogous to current strat-
egies for reporting bone mineral density testing.8,9,15 Con-
ceptually, LMS-derived Z scores include: the median (mu),
which represents how spirometry variables change based
on predictor variables (age and height); the coefficient of
variation (sigma), which models the spread of reference
values and adjusts for non-uniform dispersion; and skew-
ness (lambda), which models departure from normality.8,9
The LMS method substantially improves the calculation of
spirometric Z scores, compared to previous calculations
based on conventional multiple regression.11,12 Multiple
regression has potential limitations, because it uses inad-
equate methods for modeling the relationships between
predictor variables and spirometric variables, including in-
correctly assuming that reference values are distributed
normally and have constant variability across an individ-
ual's lifespan.8,9
SEE THE RELATED EDITORIAL ON PAGE 1861
Beyond the strong mathematical rationale, the
LMS LLN5
threshold may also have "clinical validity,"
namely a documented association with health outcomes, as
a basis for establishing respiratory impairment.13,14 Spe-
cifically, with spirometric data from a large cohort of mid-
dle-age (40­64 years) and older-age (65­80 years) per-
sons, prior work evaluated different Z score thresholds for
the ratio of FEV1
to FVC and found that the upper limit
that was associated with significantly higher risk was the
LMS LLN5
.13 That study was based on a single cohort,
however, and did not specifically evaluate the clinical va-
lidity of LMS-defined airflow limitation and restrictive-
pattern, relative to normal pulmonary function--a diag-
nostic process that requires consideration of both FVC and
FEV1
/FVC (see Methods section).6 Thus, it remained to be
seen whether the LMS method is appropriate for evaluating
respiratory impairment in middle-age and older persons.
In the present study we analyzed LMS-derived Z scores
for spirometry data from 2 large cohorts of community-
living middle-aged persons, to evaluate the association of
respiratory impairment with mortality and respiratory
symptoms. We also calculated the frequency of misiden-
tification of respiratory impairment with the current spi-
rometric criteria, relative to LMS-based assessment of re-
spiratory impairment.
Methods
This study was approved by the institutional review
boards of Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare System
and Yale University School of Medicine. The study was
conducted at the Yale Claude D Pepper Older Americans
Independence Center and the Clinical Epidemiology Re-
search Center, Veterans Affairs Connecticut Healthcare
System, West Haven, Connecticut.
Study Population
We used de-identified, publically available data from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III) and Atherosclerosis Risk in Commu-
nities study (ARIC).16,17 We included only white, middle-
age (45­64 years) participants, because LMS reference
values are currently unavailable for non-whites and be-
cause of the age range of ARIC participants.8,9,17 We an-
alyzed only data from participants who had completed at
least 2 spirometry maneuvers acceptable by the American
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/
ERS) criteria, at initial baseline examination. Per current
convention, we did not exclude participants based on spi-
rometric reproducibility criteria.18 To focus on "irrevers-
ible"pathology,participantswithself-reportedasthmawere
excluded.
NHANES III was designed to provide national esti-
mates of the health and nutritional status of the United
States non-institutionalized population.16 The NHANES III
sample, assembled in 1988­1994 and followed through
2000, used a complex design to generate a nationally rep-
resentative sample, with an age range of 8­80 years
(n  33,994).16 Based on eligibility criteria, our study
sample from NHANES III included 1,569 participants.
ARIC was a population-based, longitudinal study of mid-
dle-age persons, assembled in 1986­1989 as a probability
sample from 4 United States communities and followed
through 1998, with an age range of 45­64 years
(n  15,732).17 Based on eligibility criteria, our study
sample from ARIC included 8,163 participants.
Spirometry
In both study samples, participants underwent spirom-
etry during their baseline examination, according to the
contemporary ATS protocol,19 with equipment that met

1772 RESPIRATORY CARE · NOVEMBER 2011 VOL 56 NO 11
ATS accuracy requirements (a dry rolling-seal spirometer
in NHANES III, and a water-seal spirometer in ARIC).16,17
With each subject, FEV1
/FVC was calculated from the
largest set of FEV1
and FVC values from maneuvers that
met the ATS acceptability criteria.18,19
In both study samples, based on measured values for
each participant and as recommended, we calculated LMS-
derived Z scores for FEV1
/FVC and FVC as:
measured/median predictedlambda  1]/(lambda  sigma)
A Z score of 1.64 corresponded to the LMS LLN5
.8,9
We used the LMS prediction equations to calculate values
for the median, lambda, and skewness. We obtained cubic
splines for age from tables at http://www.lungfunction-
.org/growinglungs/software.html. Those tables are based
on 4 pooled reference samples with age range 4­80 years.8
Using the LMS LLN5
as a diagnostic threshold, and per
current convention, we classified participants as having
normal pulmonary function if both FEV1
/FVC and FVC
were  LMS LLN5
, airflow limitation if FEV1
/FVC was
 LMS LLN5
, or restrictive-pattern if FEV1
/FVC was
 LMS LLN5
and FVC was  LMS LLN5
.5,6,8,11-13
We also classified each subject's respiratory status based
on current Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) and ATS/ERS spirometric criteria. GOLD advo-
cates a fixed FEV1
/FVC of 0.70 and an FVC of 80% of
predicted.5,20 The ATS/ERS recommend the 5th percentile
of the distribution of reference values as the LLN cut-point
for both FEV1
/FVC and FVC (ATS/ERS LLN5
).6 Based
onthosethresholds,GOLDdefinesnormalpulmonaryfunc-
tion as an FEV1

Clinical Variables
We recorded baseline clinical characteristics, including
age, sex, height, body mass index, self-reported chronic
conditions, health status, and smoking history.16,17 Respi-
ratory symptoms were also evaluated, including:
· Chronic cough or sputum production, defined by a yes
response to either of the questions, "Do you usually
cough on most days for 3 consecutive months or more
during the year?" or "Do you bring up phlegm on most
days for 3 consecutive months or more during the year?"
(NHANES III and ARIC)
· Dyspnea on exertion, defined by a yes response to the
question, "Are you troubled by shortness of breath when
hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill?"
(NHANES III and ARICS)
· Wheezing, defined by a yes response to the question,
"Have you had wheezing or whistling in your chest at
any time in the past 12 months?" (NHANES III) or
"Does your chest ever sound wheezy or whistling, apart
from colds?" (ARIC).16,17
All-cause mortality was recorded in NHANES III, based
on the National Death Index, with a median follow-up of
9.2 years (IQR 7.5­10.5 y).22 ARIC recorded all-cause mor-
tality based on annual telephone calls, hospital surveillance,
vital statistics databases, and the National Death Index, with
median follow-up of 11.0 years (IQR 10.9­11.1).17
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of each study sample were first
summarized as mean  SD or as counts and percentages.
We analyzed the association between LMS-defined respi-
ratory impairment and death with Cox regression models,
adjusted for baseline clinical characteristics, including age,
height, sex, ethnicity, smoking history, body mass index,
number of chronic conditions, and health status. LMS-
defined airflow limitation and restrictive-pattern were
treated as nominal categories, and the reference group was
participants with normal pulmonary function. With each
Cox regression model, goodness-of-fit was assessed with
model-fitting procedures and analysis of residuals. We
tested the proportional hazards assumption with interac-
tion terms for the time-to-event outcome and each variable
in the multivariable model; the terms were retained if
P  .05 after adjusting for the multiplicity of comparisons.
We tested higher-order effects for the continuous covari-
ates and included them in the final model if they met the
forward selection criterion of P  .20.23 Similarly, we
evaluated the association between LMS-defined respira-
tory impairment and the presence of respiratory symptoms
by calculating odds ratios with logistic regression models.
We also calculated the prevalence of respiratory impair-
ment according to the GOLD, ATS/ERS, and LMS crite-
ria, as well as determined the frequency of misidentified
respiratory impairment (false positive and false negative)
with the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria, relative to the LMS-
based assessment.
We used statistics software (SUDAAN 10, RTI Interna-
tional, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and SAS 9.2,
SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) for all the analyses. A
2-sided P  .05 was considered statistically significant.24,25

Results
Table 1 describes the participants. Overall, the
NHANES II and ARIC samples were similar in age, fe-
male representation, body mass index, smoking status, fre-
quency of chronic conditions, self-reported COPD, and
respiratory symptoms. However, the NHANES III partic-
ipants had a greater proportion of self-reported fair-to-
poor health status ("reduced health") and a higher mortal-
ity rate.
Table 2 shows the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality.
Airflow limitation had an adjusted hazard ratio for mor-
tality of 1.90 (95% CI 1.32­2.72) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.06­
1.57) in the NHANES III and ARIC groups, respectively.
Restrictive-pattern had an adjusted hazard ratio for mor-
tality of 1.98 (95% CI 1.08­3.65) and 1.38 (95% CI 1.03­
1.85) in the NHANES III and ARIC groups, respectively.
Table 3 shows the odds ratios for respiratory symptoms.
Airflow limitation had an adjusted odds ratio for respira-
tory symptoms of 2.48 (95% CI 1.75­3.51) and 2.27
(95% CI 1.98­2.62) in the NHANES III and ARIC groups,
respectively. Restrictive-pattern had an adjusted odds ratio
for respiratory symptoms of 2.34 (95% CI 1.44­3.80) and
1.89 (95% CI 1.46­2.45) in the NHANES III and ARIC
groups, respectively.
Table 4 shows the prevalence of respiratory impairment.
For airflow limitation, GOLD yielded the highest frequen-
cies (NHANES III 22.2%, ARIC 21.6%), ATS/ERS yielded
the second highest frequencies (NHANES III 17.3%,
ARIC 15.8%), and LMS yielded the lowest frequencies
(NHANES III 15.7%, ARIC 14.3%). For restrictive-pat-
tern, ATS/ERS yielded the highest frequencies
(NHANES III 10.8%, ARIC 5.7%), GOLD yielded the
second highest frequencies (NHANES III 9.5%,
ARIC 4.9%), and LMS yielded the lowest frequencies
(NHANES III 7.2%, ARIC 3.9%).
Table 5 shows the percentages of misidentified respira-
tory impairment. GOLD substantially misidentified nor-
mal pulmonary function as respiratory impairment (false
positives), with frequencies of 27.9% and 33.6% for air-
flow limitation, and frequencies of 29.2% and 27.6% for
restrictive-pattern, in the NHANES III and ARIC groups,
respectively. ATS/ERS also misidentified normal pulmo-
nary function as respiratory impairment, but predominantly
for restrictive-pattern, with frequencies of 34.7% and
31.4%, and uncommonly for airflow limitation, with fre-
quencies of 9.0% and 9.5%, in NHANES III and ARIC,
respectively. Otherwise, GOLD and ATS/ERS infrequently
misidentified respiratory impairment as normal (false neg-
atives), with a frequency range of 0.4­2.6% for airflow
limitation and a frequency range of 1.6­10.8% for restric-
tive-pattern.
Discussion
LMS-defined airflow limitation and restrictive-pattern
were associated with a significantly higher risk of death
and likelihood of having respiratory symptoms. Moreover,
relative to LMS, we also found that the current GOLD and
ATS/ERS spirometric criteria may misidentify normal pul-
monary function as airflow limitation or restrictive-pat-
tern. These results support the use of LMS-derived Z scores
for evaluating spirometry data in middle-aged persons.
Evaluating respiratory impairment based on the
LMS method has a strong mathematical and clinical ra-
tionale.8,9,13-15 LMS-derived Z scores account for age-re-
lated changes in pulmonary function, including variability
and skewness in reference data.8,9 We found that LMS-
derived Z score thresholds for spirometric variables were
also associated with important health outcomes. All-cause
mortality is an objective and definitive outcome that is
resistant to miscoding and was the primary end point in
landmark studies of oxygen therapy.26 In addition, respi-
ratory symptoms are the most distressing feature of respi-
ratory disease and can lead to disability and increased
healthcare utilization.26,27 Although lacking specificity, the
use of respiratory symptoms as a basis for establishing
validation recognizes their importance in clinical decisions,
as evident in practice guidelines from GOLD, ATS/ERS,
and the American College of Physicians.5,28,29
Our results also quantify how often the currently ac-
cepted spirometric criteria may misidentify respiratory im-
pairment in middle-aged persons (see Table 5). For exam-

ple, based on LMS-based assessment, the GOLD criteria
frequently misidentified normal pulmonary function as air-
flow limitation or restrictive-pattern. Although they yielded
assessments of airflow limitation that were similar to LMS,
the ATS/ERS criteria nonetheless frequently misidentified
normal pulmonary function as restrictive-pattern.
The misidentification of respiratory impairment by current
spirometric criteria may reflect age-related methodological
limitations.6-14 Specifically, the GOLD thresholds for FEV1
/
FVC (0.70) and FVC (80% of predicted) have methodolog-
ical weaknesses in adults, for at least 2 reasons. First, because
normal aging is associated with increased chest-wall rigidity
and loss of elastic recoil of the lung, normal aging often leads
to an FEV1
/FVC  0.70, starting at about 40­50 years of
age.6-14 Second, spirometric performance shows increasing
variability starting at about 30 years of age, which moves the
80%-of-predicted cut-point for FVC away from the LLN.6-14
The ATS/ERS LLN5
threshold for FEV1
/FVC and FVC is
also potentially flawed, principally because it does not ade-
quately account for the age-related increased variability and
skewness in spirometric reference data.8,9,13 This means that
the ATS/ERS LLN is based only on the distribution of ref-
erence values, whereas the LMS LLN is based on a Z score
that additionally accounts for variability in spirometric per-
formance and skewness of reference data.8,9 Importantly, as
shown in prior work,8,9,13 these age-related methodological
limitations become progressively worse with advancing age
and, hence, should be the focus of future work on the spiro-
metric definition of respiratory impairment in people
 65 years old.

impairment with the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria, relative

to LMS-based assessment, is clinically relevant in middle-
aged persons cannot be established by the present study. In
particular, airflow limitation has no definitive "standard"
against which comparisons can be made, and restrictive-pat-
tern requires confirmation of reduced total lung capacity via
bodyplethysmographyorheliumdilution.6,30,31 Consequently,
future work should further evaluate the health outcomes of
participants who had misidentified respiratory impairment
with the GOLD and ATS/ERS criteria. This may require an
analytical plan that avoids a spirometry-defined reference
group for subsequent comparisons, pooling of several large
cohorts to achieve an adequate power for analysis, and a
larger array of health outcomes, including respiratory medi-
cation use and hospitalization. In addition, future work should
evaluate whether LMS-defined restrictive-pattern more accu-
rately predicts a reduced total lung capacity, relative to GOLD
and ATS/ERS.
Limitations
First, the magnitude of the associations between respira-
tory impairment and mortality were not identical across the
study samples, although the results were generally consistent
and the differences could be due to sampling issues (eg,
ARIC had a lower frequency of fair-to-poor health status and
a lower mortality rate). Of note, greater consistency was found
in the magnitude of associations between respiratory impair-
ment and respiratory symptoms across the study samples.
Second, spirometry in NHANES III and ARIC was not
specifically obtained after bronchodilator. Post-broncho-
dilator values may have had a minimal effect on our re-
sults, however, because study participants had high rates
of smoking (conferring less reversible airway pathology)
and because those who had self-reported asthma were ex-
cluded from the analytical sample.
Third, we studied only white middle-aged persons, and
racial and age-group related differences can exist in pul-
monary function.8,9,32 Although this does not impair the
validity of our study, it does affect the generalizability.
Fourth, our study samples were assembled in the late
1980s and early 1990s and followed through 1988­2000,
which raises the issue of the "timeliness" of the data,

FVC  80% of predicted.
 The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society defines airflow limitation as FEV1/FVC less than the 5th percentile of the distribution of reference values (ATS/ERS LLN5), and
restrictive-pattern as FEV1/FVC  ATS/ERS LLN5 and FVC  ATS/ERS LLN5.
 The lambda-mu-sigma system defines airflow limitation as FEV1/FVC less than the 5th percentile of the distribution of Z scores (LMS-LLN5), and restrictive-pattern as FEV1/FVC  LMS-LLN5
and FVC  LMS-LLN5.
LAMBDA-MU-SIGMA-DERIVED Z SCORE FOR EVALUATING RESPIRATORY IMPAIRMENT

should evaluate the clinical validity of LMS-defined re-
spiratory impairment in more contemporary study popu-
lations,33 including other racial, ethnic, and (older) age
groups, and with post-bronchodilator spirometry data.
Conclusions
Among white middle-age persons, LMS-defined airflow
limitation and restrictive-pattern were significantly asso-
ciated with mortality and respiratory symptoms. Conse-
quently, an approach that reports spirometric values based
on LMS-derived Z scores potentially provides an age-ap-
propriate and clinically valid strategy for evaluating respi-
ratory impairment.
