The environmental movement has used a range of theoretical
and activist challenges: protests against industrial practices
leading to climate change, defiance of consumer culture,
objections to local and global cases of environmental injus-
tice, disobedience of laws deemed to be environmentally
unfriendly. Resistance has been only part of the green move-
ment's story; environmentalists, like proponents of any
social movement, must argue for new habits and institutions
at the same time they work to defeat the old. Still, not sur-
prisingly, green thinkers have devoted a large proportion of
their energy to confrontations with orthodox theories and
practices.
As a result, a series of ongoing challenges to the Western
canon of political theory constituted a significant part of that
adversarial project during the rise and consolidation of the
20th-century environmental movement. Old masters came
under scrutiny according to a new set of standards: Were
Plato and Aristotle early greens (Westra & Robinson, 1997)?
Was Heidegger a forerunner of deep ecology (Zimmerman,
1993)? Is it time to pull environmental thinkers, such as
Thoreau, to the forefront of political theory (Bennett, 1994)?
Of these early critical reconsiderations, dominant under-
standings of Karl Marx prompted one of the most volumi-
nous and vociferous sets of arguments from the mainstream
environmental and radical ecology movements. Backers and
attackers, proponents and protesters published a profuse lit-
erature of books and journal articles on the urgent need for--
or impossibilities of--a red/green coalition. This article is
designed to summarize, explain, and evaluate key aspects of
this literature through an examination of several significant
theoretical analyses of Marx's environmental theory.
Since the 1970s, provocative critiques of Marxist thought
by mainstream environmentalists, biocentrists, survivalists,
and other factions of the ecological spectrum have demanded
reconsiderations of Marx and his theory of the relationship
between humans and their environment. This analysis has
been reciprocal rather than one-sided; many veteran leftists
responded to these challenges by taking Marx back to the
theoretical drawing board and examining the environmental
implications of Marx's writings on capitalism, alienation,
and technology. Furthermore, while some Marxists wholly
rejected the relevance of the environmental movement and
some greens summarily rejected Marx as a theoretical source,
many on each side saw themselves as engaged in an inter-
linked project of Marxist ecology, eco-Marxism, ecosocial-
ism, or red/green-left/green politics, depending on one's
favored term. From the red side of the potential coalition,
Marxist thinkers generally fell into three categories when
they were challenged to integrate Marx and environmental
theory, as described by Reiner Grundmann (1991b): the first
group included adherents of Marxist orthodoxy who spurned
efforts to construct an environmental coalition; the second
included Marxist dissidents who claimed that central princi-
ples of Marx's theory were ecologically untenable and then
moved to the green side of the debate; the third group
included thinkers who embraced the environmental project
but found all necessary answers readily available within
Marxist thought. This last position, Grundmann (1991a)
noted, "amounts to wishful thinking" (p. 103). While his own
analysis found that Marx's theory has much to offer "once

Green Views of Marx: Reinterpreting,
Revising, Rejecting, Transcending
Sheryl D. Breen1
Abstract
Is Marxist theory relevant or conducive to environmental political thought? This article considers responses to this question
and the debate regarding possibilities of a red/green coalition through examination of four green theorists who represent
positions of theoretical and historical significance: first, the argument that an enlightened reinterpretation of Marx reveals him
to be an inherently ecological thinker; second, the belief that Marxist thought holds significant value for environmental theory
but that crucial weaknesses demand essential revision; third, the rejection of Marx and his political theory as antagonistic to
environmental protection; and, finally, social ecology's use of dialectical naturalism to transcend Marx's failings.

the strait-jacket of an orthodox interpretation [is] stripped
off" (Grundmann, 1991b, p. 284), Grundmann (1991b) cau-
tioned that self-delusion must be avoided by recognizing
without regrets that "Marx was no ecologist, even if he could
have been one" (p. 6).
Similar divisions marked the green side of the debate.
Rather than examining how the environmental movement
was relevant to Marxist thought, as was the case for those
who began from the Marxist position, the question for green
theorists was whether Marx's writings were relevant to envi-
ronmental political theory. Again, several general camps
emerged regarding Marx's affinity to green theory. Some
analysts found Marx to be a seminal environmentalist whose
theories of historical materialism, commodification, and
alienation provide what is needed to analyze contemporary
ecological problems. According to these writers, the solu-
tions could be found through a new, more accurate under-
standing of Marx through enlightened reinterpretation
(Burkett, 1999; Parsons, 1977; Vaillancourt, 1996; Vogel,
1988). Not surprisingly, these defenders of Marxist ecology
tended to concentrate on Marx's earlier writings, which took
a more interdependent view of humans' relationship with
nature. A second group was much tougher on Marx, arguing
that although his political economy was crucial in certain
ways, it also contained significant flaws by way of cultural
bias, theoretical omissions, or logical errors. This group,
which yielded a large output of astute and articulate writing
(Benton, 1989, 1992; Luke, 1999; O'Connor, 1998; Pepper,
1993; Redclift, 1985), tried to move Marxist thought to a
higher level of theory and practice through ecological revi-
sion. However, members of a third class of green theorists
judged these first two groups as remaining dangerously
mired within the modern Promethean mission of controlling
nature--a mission, they argued, in which Marx was still
thoroughly engaged. These writers, who tended to focus their
critiques on Marx's later works, insisted that he could not
stand as an environmental defender and must be rejected
rather than revised or reinterpreted (Eckersley, 1992;
Henderson, 1989; Routley, 1981). As a result, they argued,
the environmental movement must pursue a new theoretical
foundation rather than a red/green coalition or eco-Marxist
rectification. A fourth position, held by Murray Bookchin
(1988, 1990, 1991, 1996), took a still different route, arguing
for a dialectical naturalism that adopts, disowns, and tran-
scends various aspects of Marx's theory.
The literature for these positions within green political
thought has been rich and the debate remains unsettled. As a
means of identifying and explaining the core arguments
within each of these responses, this article provides a primer
of green approaches through examination of four landmark
contributors who set the stage for ecological considerations of
Marx. Howard L. Parson's (1977) book Marx and Engels on
Ecology laid out the representative arguments for an enlight-
ened reinterpretation, Ted Benton's (1989) Marxism and
Natural Limits voiced the call for revision, and Val Routley
(later Plumwood) argued that Marxist thought must be
rejected by environmental theorists in her oft-cited article in
Environmental Ethics (Routley, 1981). Murray Bookchin's
critical response to Marx demands additional attention. His
dialectical approach within the project of social ecology
would appear to bring him close to Marxist theory, yet his
goal of libertarian municipalism and focus on hierarchical
social relations as the root of ecological problems also yielded
a strident critique of Marx's broader mission. Bookchin
pointed to social ecology's philosophy of dialectical natural-
ism as an "ecologized" approach that transcended Marx's
methodical and theoretical errors, rejected capitalism's instru-
mental reasoning, and shunned "sloppy" ecologists' turn to
anti-rationalism and mysticism. Following a survey of diver-
gent ecological analyses by Parsons, Benton, and Plumwood,
therefore, I turn to an examination of Bookchin's response to
Marx through the process of dialectical naturalism.
Reinterpreting Marx: Parsons and Marx
and Engels on Ecology
For Howard L. Parsons, an investigation into the writings of
Marx and Engels in search of ecological meaning was any-
thing but "a trivial form of scholarship and an example of
special pleading." On the contrary, as he wrote in his influen-
tial volume of original analysis and compilations from those
works, "Marx and Engels had an understanding of
an approach to ecology before the German zoologist,
Ernst Haeckel, coined the term Oekologie in 1869, and long
before the current `ecological crisis' and `energy crisis'"
(Parsons, 1977, p. xi). Parsons clearly did not see himself as
a Marxist in ecological masquerade who was attempting to
deflect a new set of annoying criticisms. Instead, he pre-
sented himself as a full-fledged environmental thinker who
regarded the ecological movement as a crucial and integral
part of the socialist struggle.
It was no accident, Parsons (1977) wrote, that the modern
conception of nature based on dialectics and ecology arose
during Marx's era, responding to the scientific and historical
unveiling of "the interactive, evolutionary, and transforma-
tive character of nature and society" (p. 4). Once we under-
stand the dialectical method, according to Parsons, we also
will know the inherent link between ecological and dialecti-
cal thought:
[E]cology as a specific science of ecosystems displays the
principles of the general science of nature, or dialectics. For
dialectics as a science of systems generally is concerned with the
interactions of two or more living or nonliving systems with one
another and with their environment. Ecology is the application of
dialectics to living systems, and dialectics is the generalization of
the method of ecology from living systems to all systems. (p. 7)
As a result, Parsons (1977) argued, a new understanding
of Marx's works quickly reveals a "dialectical, ecological
Breen 3
standpoint." Humans' physical and spiritual lives are insepa-
rable from nature (man's "inorganic body") because nature
cannot be separated from itself and because humans are part
of nature, as Marx wrote in The Economic and Philosophic
Manuscripts of 1844. With no doubt as to his intended
answer, Parsons rhetorically asked, "Has there been a better,
more succinct, ecological statement of man's place in nature
than this?" (p. 10). Marx's sensitivity to ecological laws and
our violation of those laws is evident, he wrote, citing pas-
sages in Capital Vol. 3 regarding waste and squandering of
the soil. Through these writings, according to Parsons, "the
true humanist turns out to be the true naturalist, and the true
radical to be the true conservative" (p. 19).
An extensive part of Parsons' (1977) project was an
unsuccessful attempt to turn aside four common criticisms
from ecologists who were less sympathetic to green readings
of Marx and Engels. First, he argued, Marx did not pit man
against nature as alleged. Dialectical materialism affirms
both opposition and unity of humans and nature, according
to Parsons, and any opposition to nature in the sense of eco-
logical destructiveness "is by definition impossible in true
Marxism" (p. 43). On this count, he wrote, Marx stands well
ahead of those ecologists who paradoxically claim to love
nature but hate humanity: "It was not that Marx and Engels
did not love nature; it was that they loved both it and man-
kind" (p. 41). Parsons then took on the charge that Marx was
anthropocentric and thus denied the values of nonhuman
nature. Here Parsons returned to the inseparability of humans
and nature and again embraced a departure from those green
theorists who had purveyed the "unrealistic" argument that
concerns about nature can be addressed independently of
concerns about humans. Marx, quite rightly, rejected this
unrealism and emphasized human needs, so "if the assump-
tion of the criticism is that Marxism has this emphasis, the
assumption is correct" (p. 45). This does not make Marx
unecological, Parsons maintained, but "at the very worst,"
may leave some open questions regarding the issue of values
in nature: "In my own reading of these writings there is noth-
ing that finally forecloses the issue, in spite of what defend-
ers or attackers of Marx and Engels may say" (p. 50).
In similar fashion, Parsons (1977) sought ways to refute a
third criticism alleging that Marx had overemphasized con-
flicts in nature and overlooked the presence of harmony. This
charge cannot be upheld, Parsons argued, as cooperation is
inherent in Marx's conception of nature. Because humans
and nature are inextricably linked, humans cannot be changed
or fulfilled without also changing and fulfilling nature.
Humans therefore share needs with other peoples and other
nonhuman animals, and "if man is a human animal, as
Marxism maintains, man's needs require the full support of
both society and nature" (p. 57). Finally, a fourth criticism
offered by ecologists came under Parsons' scrutiny.
According to Parsons, it is untrue that Marx denied basic
human values, but instead he worked to liberate humanity
from alienation within society and nature--itself an
ecological movement. "The inevitable pathway to this new
ecological system is the transformation of capitalism into
socialism under the leadership of a proletarian political
movement" (p. 67).
Through this ecological interpretation of Marx's writings,
Parsons engaged in twin projects. First, he hoped to refute
the critiques offered by both Marxists and non-Marxists and
allow Marxist theory to claim the primary analytic window
for the ecological movement. Second, Parsons relentlessly
worked toward a conclusion he hoped was inescapable: that
Marxist theory not only is ecologically friendly in the sense
that it can be turned toward environmental issues but,
more importantly, that it inherently and unavoidably leads to
the verdict that ecological problems are inseparable from
issues of political economy and class. The urgent need facing
the environmental movement was not rejection of Marxist
theory and adoption of a new political philosophy, according
to Parsons, but rather recapture of the comprehensive under-
standing of ecological issues contained within Marx's dialec-
tical materialism.
His call for this recapturing of Marx did not go unheard;
reflections of Parsons' sympathetic reinterpretation of Marx
are found in more recent analyses, particularly in the work of
John Bellamy Foster (Foster et al., 2010) and Paul Burkett
(2006). Ultimately, however, Parsons' presentation of Marx
failed in its attempt to revitalize Marx as an early green
thinker and, instead, has been viewed as "anachronistic in the
worst sense" through Parsons' ploy of reinvention
(Humphrey, 2002, p. 142).
Revising Marx: Benton and Marxism
and Natural Limits
Many other writers have been considerably less willing than
Parsons to give Marx credit for an ecological vision. These
theorists, including both Marxists and non-Marxists, have
regarded Marx's work as a valuable and, for some, a crucial
part of the ecological quest for solutions, but they have
argued for much more than a selective and ecologically sym-
pathetic reinterpretation. Instead, they have proposed critical
revisions of Marx's writings to reconstruct historical materi-
alism on an ecological level. One influential revisionist is
Ted Benton (1989, 1992, 1993, 1996), who has argued that
Marxist theory as it stands is unable to conceptualize the eco-
logical limits of humans' relation with nature. Because Marx
feared an opening for the conservative natural-limits argu-
ment of Thomas Robert Malthus, according to Benton, he
provided an unfinished critique of classical political econ-
omy, resulting in "a series of related conflations, impreci-
sions and lacunae." The resolution of this problem is not
avoidance or rejection of Marx, Benton (1989) wrote, but
rather a project of correction, as "there is much in the corpus
of Marxist historical materialism which is readily compatible
with an ecological perspective" (p. 63). Along with others,
Benton (1996) has sought "to build from a critical revision of
4 SAGE Open
the Marxist classics towards an ecologically informed his-
torical materialism" (p. 103).
For Benton, this project of correction must produce, first,
a retheorization of the concept of labor process, which Marx
defined as the eternal condition of human existence as
imposed by our natural environment, and second, the con-
cept of mode of production. In his writings, Marx viewed the
labor process as transformative, consisting of a raw material
turned into a use value through human labor and the utiliza-
tion of other raw materials and instruments of labor. Benton
was unwilling to accept this definition, however, arguing that
Marx thus overgeneralizes all labor processes as fitting the
productive model. Some practices, such as raising crops or
livestock, cannot be incorporated within that model, he
argued, and the transformative aspect of these "eco-regula-
tory" practices is achieved not through human labor but by
nature's organic mechanisms. Rather than transforming,
human labor in eco-regulatory practices works to sustain,
regulate, and reproduce, in Benton's view, and the Marxist
"subject of labor" is not the raw material (i.e., the wheat seed
or calf) but the ecological conditions in which that material
grows and matures. Human labor cannot be regarded as the
transformative tool for this category of practice, according to
Benton (1989), due to the range of elements that are "rela-
tively impervious to intentional manipulation, and in some
respects they are absolutely non-manipulable" (p. 68).
Furthermore, Benton (1989) argued, Marx's account of
the labor process failed with respect to labor processes that
can be assimilated within the productive model. Even here,
Marx's conception "is shown to exaggerate their potentially
transformative character, whilst under-theorizing or occlud-
ing the various respects in which they are subject to naturally
given and/or relatively non-manipulable conditions and lim-
its" (p. 73). Such weaknesses in Marx's theory are not merely
discrete errors, according to Benton, but "are coherent with
significant strands in the wider theoretical perspectives of
Marx and Engels, and they have a certain plausibility given
the historical location of their thinking" (p. 74). Marx also
held an optimistic view about the emancipation of man by
becoming master of both his social organization and nature,
Benton argued, suggesting "an underlying antagonism
between human purposes and nature: either we control
nature, or it controls us! No room, apparently, for symbiosis,
peaceful co-existence, mutual indifference or other imagin-
able metaphors for this relationship" (p. 75).
If Marx is indeed a purveyor of a Promethean project of
nature's dominion, contrary to Parsons' vision of Marx as an
early ecologist, must we then reject Marxist theory altogether?
Certainly not, Benton (1989) argued, for "now we have
reached the point in the argument where we can begin to see
the potential fruitfulness of Marx's critical account of capital-
ist accumulation, once defects in his concept of the labour-
process are corrected" (p. 77, italics in original). We must find
the path that "avoids both the Scylla of epistemic conservatism
and the Charybdis of `social-constructionist' utopianism," he
warned, and offered three means by which to do so. First,
through a re-conceptualization of the labor processes, we must
recognize that the interrelations between humans and nature
enable as well as limit. While "naturally given processes,
mechanisms and conditions make possible human need-meet-
ing practices which otherwise could not occur," that power of
possibility, "conferred on human agents by a specific social
relation to a natural condition or mechanism, will also be
bounded in its scope by that self-same relation" (p. 78, italics
in original). Second, in contrast to Malthusian natural-limits
conservatism, we must recognize that limits are contextual
within specific relations between society and nature; "what
constitutes a genuine natural limit for one such form of nature/
society articulation may not constitute a limit for another"
(p. 79, italics in original). Limits to growth thus should not be
seen as either social-limits or natural-limits simpliciter, Benton
(1992) argued, but rather as effects of particular combinations
of social and natural forces (p. 58). For Benton, recognition of
these contextual and interdependent limits through retheoriza-
tion of the labor process returns Marxist theory to a central
position in the analysis of society/nature (and therefore eco-
logical) relations and furthers arguments for the need for trans-
forming existing relations.
In contrast to the comparatively short-lived influence of
Parsons'reinterpretation model, Benton's call for a revision of
Marx has demonstrated significant staying power. In a volume
of essays in his honor (Moog & Stones, 2009), Sandra Moog
provides a testament to Benton's leading role within ecoso-
cialist theory when she compares Benton's analysis of culture/
nature dualism to other approaches, such as those of radical
ecologists and Bruno Latour (2004). Moog (2009) firmly con-
cludes that Benton has provided "a fundamentally more coher-
ent approach to practical ecological politics" (p. 40).
Rejecting Marx: Routley/Plumwood and
"On Karl Marx as an environmental
hero"
Both Marx's concept of transformation and the need to rec-
ognizenaturallimitsalsoplaycentralrolesinValPlumwood's
assessment of Marx, but this green theorist was far less ame-
nable than Benton to correcting flaws and retaining the rest.
Plumwood, writing under her earlier surname of Routley
(1981), set out to scrutinize characterizations of Marx as "an
environmental hero" and quickly found him falling irrepara-
bly short of the mark. The article in which she presented her
arguments was relatively brief, in response to a revisionist
presentation by Donald C. Lee (1980), but during this period,
Plumwood presented the most significant challenges to Marx
from the ecocentric end of the spectrum of environmental
theory. She found no fault with Marx's anti-capitalist stand
nor with Lee's extrapolation that capitalism is largely respon-
sible for contemporary ecological crises, but she argued that
the project is not merely one of manipulating Marxist prin-
ciples to fit new ecological ideas:
Breen 5
[I]t would be unfortunate if the attempt to work out an alternative
nature ethic for a non-capitalist society had to take the form of
revamping Marx and of merely reinterpreting the radically
unsatisfactory material he provides. Those who work for an
environmentally conscious non-capitalist society need to go
beyond Marx and draw on a broader range of philosophical,
ethical, and socialist traditions (including the ethical traditions
of some of the "primitive" societies Marxists tend to see as so
backward), for Marx's views on nature, and associated central
parts of this theory, belong to the past, and are far too close to
those which lie at the root of many of our troubles. (p. 244)
The foundational problem, according to Plumwood, lies
in Marx's concept of the relationship between humans and
nature. Marx's declaration of unity between humans and
nature, so applauded by Parsons and seen as theoretically
salvageable by Benton, is no more than a declaration of man
creating nature through transformation that destroys what is
nonhuman or "the other" and replaces it with a humanized
version, Plumwood argued. Unity and harmony are achieved
only because nature no longer has an independent identity,
meaning that Marx's concept of nature as man's "inorganic
body" has not satisfied a central criterion of dialectical syn-
thesis (p. 238). Attempts by Marxist eco-revisionists have
failed, and will continue to fail, Plumwood charged, due to
the logical impossibility of presenting Marxist theory in an
ecological light. If Marx is portrayed as ecologically friendly,
presentation of his doctrines must be obscure; if his doctrines
are presented clearly, the portrayal must be ecologically
unfavorable (p. 239).
Plumwood went on to delineate several specific ways in
which Marx had gone wrong. First, she pointed out, Marx
ousted God from Hegel's system of order and gave humans
that role of creation and expression, a move that put Marxist
theory "on a head-on collision course with any attempt to
develop a genuine and deep environmental consciousness"
(p. 241). As a result, the ecology movement must dedicate
itself to rejecting this transposition:
The development of environmental consciousness is in large
part a process of discarding this Enlightenment legacy, of
upsetting the human hubris which resulted from it and restoring
a sense of the limitation of human powers and human ability to
understand, interfere with, and manipulate a larger natural order.
(p. 240, italics in original)
In addition, Plumwood argued, Marx's view of capitalism
as a necessary stage in human development collapses once
we reject his argument that we must dominate nature to
become fully human. Our need to acquire power over nature
played a central role in Marx's theory of history, explaining
the development of classes and the final abolition of classes
through technological progress, but when the principle of
nature-transformation has been cast off, so is much of the
rest of Marxist theory (p. 241). Plumwood also argued that
Marx's ill-founded view of animals as inferior to humans
must give way to research indicating that many animals have
consciousness and are capable of activities that humans can-
not reproduce. Finally, according to Plumwood, Marx's posi-
tion on energy use and minimization of life-sustaining labor
was neither plausible nor appealing in ecological terms, and
his acquiescence to centralization and technology cannot be
accepted by ecologists working for decentralization and
alternative technologies.
According to Plumwood's critique, an ecologist hoping
for firm Marxist ground on which to take a position instead
quickly sinks into quicksand. Rather than reinterpret Marx or
engage in obscure attempts at reconstruction, Plumwood
argued, the ecology movement must set aside Marx's homo-
centric transformation of nature and look for solid ground
instead. Her contention gained widespread notice at the time
and was cited frequently within the literature surrounding the
search for a red/green coalition, along with the lengthier and
more developed critique of Marx that Eckersley (1992) pro-
vided a decade later. However, Plumwood's legacy as an
ecological thinker arose primarily from her ecofeminist writ-
ings (e.g., Plumwood, 1993), rather than her attempt to
dethrone Marx from his status as an ecological hero.
Transcending Marx: Bookchin, Social
Ecology, and Dialectical Naturalism
In this search for solid ground, Bookchin was one green the-
orist who believed he had found it in both objective and ethi-
cal terms. As a lifelong leftist who had moved from Marxism
to Trotskyism to libertarian anarchism to a position he called
libertarian municipalism, Bookchin saw his project as one of
using "the dialectical approach of Marx in order to transcend
Marxism itself dialectically," in the words of his collaborator
and partner Janet Biehl (1997, p. 123). Unlike the main-
stream environmental movement, Bookchin argued that
environmental problems are caused by institutionalized
domination of humans by other humans. Unlike many radi-
cal ecologists such as Plumwood, he rejected biocentric
moral standing, and unlike eco-Marxists such as Parsons, he
turned his attention beyond capitalist modes of production
and class structures.
In an odd way, Bookchin's distinctive approach, called
social ecology, has been at once all-encompassing and yet
peculiarly restrictive. Even while his half century of pub-
lished writing took on all of human history and his ideas have
constituted one of the most extensively developed and influ-
ential theories within the North American ecological move-
ment, social ecology as a body of work has continued to be
identified almost exclusively with him alone. He earned a
deserved reputation for brutal (but highly quotable) polemics
against deep ecologists, ecofeminists, and other members of
the green movement who had practiced, in his view, anti-
rational mysticism, sentimentalism, and misanthropy with
tendencies toward eco-fascism (Bookchin, 1988). As one
6 SAGE Open
example, he characterized deep ecology as "spawned among
well-to-do people who have been raised on a spiritual diet of
Eastern cults mixed with Hollywood and Disneyland fanta-
sies" (Bookchin, 1990, p. 11). He was less well-known for--
but equally pitiless in--his attacks on theoretical colleagues
and associates who moved too far from his own stand. Some
ecological theorists became so concerned about this increas-
ing isolation and its portents that an edited volume was
devoted to the question of whether social ecology had a
future beyond Bookchin (Light, 1998). The answer so far is
uncertain. Since his death in 2006, new volumes continue to
examine and "recover" Bookchin's work (Price, 2012;
White, 2008) and the Institute for Social Ecology, which he
founded, maintains momentum. However, despite the broad
use of the phrase "social ecology" in the causal analysis of
crime, disease, and other social ills, social ecology as a form
of environmental political theory continues to be associated
almost entirely with Bookchin's work.
Whether Bookchin's version of social ecology was able to
develop through interaction with other leftist and ecological
traditions or stood apart in isolation, there is no doubt that his
theories deserve critical and constructive debate. As a liber-
tarian anarchist/municipalist focused on questions of liberty,
he argued that a free society also must be an ecological soci-
ety, a foundational conclusion based on an evolutionary
approach he called dialectical naturalism. Nature is not sim-
ply all that exists (the "real"), according to Bookchin (1996),
but an organic evolutionary development of the rational real-
ization of the potential (the "actual"; p. 125). From a purely
biological world, which he called the "first nature," this pro-
cess of potentialities moves from the inanimate to the ani-
mate, from the simple to the complex and differentiated, from
the subatomic to the sentient and social human world, or the
"second nature." In The Ecology of Freedom (1991),
Bookchin traced a logical and anthropological history of soci-
ety from "organic" preliterate groups operating on egalitarian
principles through the emergence of hierarchies based on fac-
tors such as age, shamanism, gender, chiefdom, and eventu-
ally, classes and nation-states. Institutionalized hierarchy is
therefore found only among humans, as animal communities
are not social, Bookchin argued, and the results have been
catastrophic. These "organized systems of command and obe-
dience" sabotage the realization of the evolutionary potential
in the second nature, through domination of humans by other
humans, as well as in the first nature, through domination and
destruction of nonhuman life and ecosystems.
In Bookchin's (1996) view, freedom is impossible unless
domination in all of its complexity is exposed and elimi-
nated, and "the resolution of this social crisis can only be
achieved by reorganizing society along rational lines, imbued
with an ecological philosophy and sensitivity" (p. 120). As a
result, his consideration of evolutionary development did not
stop at the second nature: Dialectical naturalism
is eductive rather than merely deductive, mediated rather than
merely processual, and cumulative rather than merely
continuous. Its objectivity begins with the existence of the
potential, not with the mere facticity of the real; hence its ethics
seeks the "what-should-be" as a realm of objective possibilities.
(Bookchin, 1996, p. 134, italics in original)
What should be, according to Bookchin, is an ecological
society of "free nature" that, as synthesis, would transcend
both the first and second nature while maintaining their
integrity and specificity (p. 136).
This blend of ecological anarchism and dialectical reason-
ing shuns the anti-rational, misanthropic sentimentality of
biocentric greens, according to Bookchin, as well as consti-
tuting a foundational critique of Marxist thought. Dialectical
naturalism challenges not only the reductionism of domina-
tion introduced by feminism and mystical ecologism, he
charged, "but also brings into question the one-sided econo-
mistic simplifications that are rooted in traditional Marxian
class analyses." The importance of class should not be
ignored in ecological considerations, he cautioned, but "class
rule must be placed in the much larger context of hierarchy
and domination as a whole" (Bookchin, 1991, p. xxvi, italics
in original).
Bookchin, like Benton, found much room for challenge in
Marx's writings and he regularly voiced his cantankerous
contempt. In addition to the exclusivity of class analysis,
Marx must be faulted for purveying the "myth" of the prole-
tariat and party, in Bookchin's view. As an anarchist,
Bookchin expressed deep antagonism to Marx's vision of a
centralized state and, like Plumwood, he rejected the authori-
tarian regimes that ruled in Marx's name in the 20th century.
While revolutionary anarchists stressed choice, Bookchin
(1990) wrote, Marxism focused on "the inexorability of
social laws." As a tragic result, "Marxism virtually silenced
all earlier revolutionary voices for more than a century and
held history itself in the icy grip of a remarkably bourgeois
theory of development based on the domination of nature
and the centralization of power" (pp. 168-169).
In addition, Bookchin repudiated a view that, he argued,
Marx shared with many 19th-century philosophers: the con-
cept of nature as a stingy provider with whom humans must
wrestle to maintain life. This vision of natural scarcity meant
that liberation must be achieved, at least in part, through
technological innovations that allow human command of the
forces of nature. Without scientific and industrial know-how,
according to Marx, nature always holds the upper hand.
Without technology, surpluses are nonexistent, just enough
to support elite rulers or, if distributed equally, a means of
equal poverty. Liberation can be achieved only after technol-
ogy spurs development of the productive forces to a point at
which humans are freed from material want and "bread
labor." The abolition of a class system, therefore, presup-
poses extensive technological progress. Marx's belief in
natural scarcity and mandatory technological development,
according to Bookchin's critique, thus led Marx to affirm the
role of domination as an inevitable part of our need to control
the natural world. The implications of this approach were
Breen 7
devastating, Bookchin argued. Marx believed that to conquer
nature and its grudging provisions,
[p]eople become instruments of production, just like the tools
and machines they create. They, in turn, are subject to the same
forms of coordination, rationalization, and control that society
tries to impose on nature and inanimate technical instruments.
Labor is both the medium whereby humanity forges its own self-
formation and the object of social manipulation. (Bookchin,
1991, p. 65)
Bookchin unfavorably compared this view to Greek polit-
ical thought, which saw men fulfilling their humanity by
means of rational life within a polis. In contrast, Marx's argu-
ment that men are defined by their mode of production turned
domination into a technical question, not an ethical one.
Marx's "incredibly reductionist framework" asked us to
judge issues of domination in terms of technical criteria,
"however distasteful such a criterion might have seemed to
Marx himself, had he faced it in all its brute clarity" (Biehl,
1997, p. 126).
Marx not only offered a simplistic view of the revolution-
ary path to economic liberty, Bookchin argued, but provided
a stunning defense for domination itself. Marx saw classes'
reason for existence, once they had arisen, in the pursuit of
the ultimate goal of the "good life" through domination of
nature, which, in turn, demanded the manipulation of labor
by an elite class of bosses. For Marx, the exploitation of
humans as tools of production was simply a step toward mas-
tery of nature by humans in their pursuit of liberation under
communism. His goal may have been a valuable one,
Bookchin (1991) wrote, but "no more plausible apologia for
the existence of class or state rule has ever appeared over the
course of history, and few have provided better excuses for
domination than this one" (p. xxvii).
Disastrously, in Bookchin's view, the conclusion to Marx's
concept of natural scarcity and surplus achieved through tech-
nology was an acquiescent "fatalism" that saw liberation
intrinsically tied to domination of man by man because of the
need to dominate nature, thus placing "the onus for domina-
tion primarily on the demanding forces of nature." That was a
conclusion Bookchin (1996) vigorously disallowed:
My own writings radically reverse this very traditional view of
the relationship between society and nature. I argue that the idea
of dominating nature first arose within society as part of its
institutionalization into gerontocracies that placed the young in
varying degrees of servitude to the old and in patriarchies that
placed women in varying degrees of servitude to men--not in
any endeavor to "control" nature or natural forces . . . Hence,
domination can be definitively removed only by resolving
problematics that have their origins in hierarchy and status, not in
class and the technological control of nature alone. (p. 142, n. 2)
While Bookchin's critique of Marx was broad and some-
times harsh, he cannot easily be placed with Plumwood as
one who called for rejection of Marxist theory; he granted
applause to Marx's theory of commodification and many
parts of his theory of capitalist development. Most impor-
tantly, in terms of social ecology, Bookchin recognized his
allegiance to Marx in two roles: first, Bookchin was a pur-
veyor of the tradition of dialectical reasoning "that Marx had
inherited from Hegel and that Bookchin himself inherited
from Marx" (Biehl, 1997, p. 124), and second, as a steward
through the Marxist tradition of the Enlightenment's com-
mitment to humanism and rationalism. By remaining com-
mitted to these parts of the Marxist inheritance, Bookchin
believed, social ecology could fight the urgent battle against
dangerous intellectual sloppiness within the ecological
movement. These elements, he worried, may be spurned by
"eco-faddists" who "either ignore muscularity of thought as
too `heavy' or else . . . condemn it as intellectually `linear'
and `divisive'" (1996, p. 98). At the same time, he argued,
"ecologizing the dialectic" allowed his theory to address the
differentiation and potentialities of nature as well as the com-
plex forms of social domination, thus ensuring, in his view,
that social ecology transcends Marx.
Conclusion
Is Marxist theory conducive to political ecology? Answers to
this question clearly are not built on consensus. The Marxist
portfolio is massive, sometimes inconsistent, and character-
ized by ambiguity, and vehement arguments in the debate
over whether Marxist theory is ecologically sensitive have
ranged from an absolute "yes" to an irrevocable "no" to a
great many versions of "not exactly, but . . ." Parsons'
response provided a model of those Marxist defenders who
viewed the environmental project as wholly in tune with the
socialist project and Marx's writings as the most appropriate
source of environmental theory. Benton, in contrast, repre-
sents the large body of work that has been at once sympa-
thetic to foundational elements of Marxist theory yet
cognizant of the historical and theoretical weaknesses that
demand revision. Serving as the illustration of environmental
political theorists who have found no promising basis within
Marxist thought, Plumwood (writing as Routley) called for
the rejection of Marx and the construction of ecological the-
ory from other sources. Finally, working from a dialectical
understanding of nature that both recognizes and undermines
Marx, Bookchin offered a complex critique in his project of
transcending Marxist theory.
In their writings from the 1970s through the 1990s, these
four theorists set the stage for continued, divisive, and valu-
able analyses of ecological and Marxist theory. Their dis-
agreements, defenses, and arguments promoted a deeper and
more critical understanding of Marxist theory, turning us
toward a crucial avenue of interrogation of Marx's under-
standing of humans, nature, and the environment. The debate
remains both vigorous and contentious more than a decade
later, as signaled by the longevity of the neo-Marxist journal
