Self-Reported Health Among Older
Bangladeshis: How Good a Health
Indicator Is It?
M. Omar Rahman, MD, MPH, DSc,1 and Arthur J. Barsky, MD2
Purpose: This study examines the value of self-
reported health (SRH) as an indicator of underlying
health status in a developing country setting. Design
and Methods: Logistic regression methods with
adjustments for multistage sampling are used to
examine the factors associated with SRH in 2,921
men and women aged 50 and older in rural
Bangladesh. Results: SRH incorporates multiple di-
mensions of health status (including physical disability
assessed by measured physical performance; self-
reported limitations in activities of daily living, or
ADLs; self-reported chronic morbidity; and self-
reported acute morbidity), severity, comorbidity,
and trajectory in a similar fashion for both men and
women and for different age groups. Older individ-
uals are more likely to report poor SRH than their
younger counterparts, and women report significantly
worse SRH than their male peers at each age group.
In both cases, this disadvantage can be fully
accounted for by differences in measured physical
performance, ADL limitations, and chronic and acute
morbidity. Implications: Among older Banglade-
shis, SRH is an easily recorded, multifaceted,
nuanced indicator of underlying health status that is
significantly associated with measured physical per-
formance. Moreover, SRH appears to be indepen-
dent of age- and gender-related norms.

One of the major constraints in assessing the
health of elderly populations is the lack of health
status indicators that can be readily collected for
large numbers of individuals with minimal expen-
diture of resources (time, money, and logistics).
This has sparked considerable interest in self-
reported measures of health status. Perhaps the
most widely used is self-reported general health
(SRH), in which respondents are asked to classify
their current health status on some form of
hierarchical scale (e.g., good, fair, or poor). Multi-
ple studies have demonstrated that SRH is a good
predictor of mortality and functional ability, even
after objective measurements of medical morbidity
(e.g., laboratory tests or physicians' reports) have
been controlled for (Appels, Bosma, Grabauskas,
Gostautas, & Sturmans, 1996; Borawski, Kinney, &
Kahana, 1996; Idler & Benyamini, 1997; Idler &
Kasl, 1991, 1995; Kaplan & Camacho, 1983;
Mossey & Shapiro, 1982; Schoenfeld, Malmrose,
Blazer, Gold, & Seeman, 1994; Sugisawa, Liang, &
Liu, 1994; Wolinsky & Johnson, 1992). It has been
hypothesized that the strong predictive value of
SRH, even after appropriate controls have been
instituted, is related to its multifaceted and nuanced
nature, whereby it incorporates multiple dimensions
of health (physical disability, functional or activity
limitations, and chronic and acute morbidity),
measures of severity, indications of comorbidity,
and past trajectory (Idler & Benyamini, 1997).
Relatively few studies have explicitly examined the
multifaceted nature of SRH in detail (Idler, 1993;
Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993; Leinonen, Heikkinen,
& Jylha
¨ , 1998, 2001; Schulz et al., 1994; Zimmer,
Natividad, Lin, & Chayovan, 2000), especially with
regard to interactions between different dimensions
of health, and the impact of past trajectory on SRH
(Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2001; Wolinsky &
Tierney, 1998).

In addition to understanding the composite nature
of SRH, a number of questions arise with regard to
gender and age influences on SRH. Inconsistent
gender differences have been reported, with some
studies showing a female disadvantage (Gijsbers van
Wijk, van Vliet, Kolk, & Everaerd, 1991; Rahman,
Strauss, Gertler, Ashley, & Fox, 1994; Zimmer et al.,
2000) and others showing no disadvantage (Jylha
¨ ,
Guralnik, Ferrucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen, 1998;
Leinonen et al., 1998; McDonough & Walters,
2001; Zimmer et al., 2000). With regard to age
trends, some studies have demonstrated that SRH
remains constant or even improves with age (Barsky,
Frank, Cleary, Wyshak, & Klerman, 1991; Idler,
1993; Johnson, Mullooly, & Greenlick, 1990;
Leinonen et al., 2001; Rakowski & Cryan, 1990),
despite the fact that there are age-related declines in
physical performance and increases in acute and
chronic morbidity (Hoeymans & Feskens, 1996;
Laukkanen, Leskinen, Kauppinen, Sakari-Rantala, &
Heikkinen, 2000). Possible explanations of this
seeming paradox are that, with increasing age,
individuals may adjust downward their expectations
of good health by implicitly using age-related norms,
and that physical health contributes less and less to
overall perceptions of health (Idler, 1993; Leinonen
et al., 2001; Peck, 1968; Pilpel, Carmel, & Galinsky,
1988; Tornstam, 1975).
The detailed exploration of SRH has been largely
limited to the developed world. Very few analyses
have been published using data from developing
countries (Rahman et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1998;
Zimmer et al., 2000), largely because of the absence of
information on potentially key determinants of SRH
such as acute and chronic morbidity, limitations in
activities of daily living (ADLs), and, what is most
important, measured physical performance. Interna-
tional explorations of SRH are particularly valuable,
because there may be important differences in the
association of SRH with other health indicators
(Angel & Guarnaccia, 1989; Ferraro & Kelley-
Moore, 2001; Jylha
¨ et al., 1998; Rahman et al.,
1994; Zimmer et al., 2000). More specifically, one
might hypothesize that, because of lower levels of
education and formal contact with the health care
system in the developing world compared with the
developed world, individuals in the developing world
would have less knowledge about acute and chronic
morbidity; consequently, the relationship between
acute and chronic morbidity and other subjective and
objective health measures would be weaker in the
developing world than in the developed world. In
a similar vein, because of high levels of family support
and lower expectations of independence of movement
in the developing world versus the developed world,
one might expect physical disability and functional
limitations to have a weaker association with SRH in
the former compared with the latter.
Rural Bangladesh is an example of a developing
society with widespread poverty, low levels of
education (particularly for elderly persons), low
mobility for women outside the home, numerous
environmental hazards, and poorly developed com-
munity health and educational infrastructure. Per
capita income is $370/year. The overwhelming
majority of older individuals live with adult children
(mostly sons), and alternative sources of support--
financial and otherwise--outside the family are
scarce. The predominant occupation for rural men
is agriculture, with labor force participation rates
remaining very high even for older men. Women are
largely restricted by convention to activities within
the home and have relatively little opportunity to
venture outside the homestead. Given the high level
of poverty and the scarcity of health providers (4,071
persons per physician and 17,446 persons per
registered nurse), contact with the formal health
care system is thought to be relatively infrequent.
The population of persons over the age of 50
constitutes approximately 10% of the population
as a whole, and life expectancy at age 50 is ap-
proximately 30 years with no significant gender dif-
ference (Aziz, 1979; Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics,
2002; Rahman, 1986; Rahman et al., 1999).
In this analysis we use a comprehensive data set
from rural Bangladesh to investigate the following
questions. First, to what extent does SRH incorpo-
rate multiple dimensions of health, severity and
comorbidity? Second, are there differences in SRH
by gender, and, if so, what accounts for these
differences? Third, does the relationship of objec-
tively measured physical performance limitations to
SRH change with age?
Design and Methods
Subjects and Setting
The specific data for analysis come from the
Matlab Health and Socio-Economic Survey (MHSS)
in rural Bangladesh, which collected in 1996, in
a multistage sample design, detailed health and
socioeconomic information on approximately 11,200
individuals aged 15 and older in 2,687 baris or
residential compounds, and 4,364 households within
these baris. The sample was drawn from an ongoing
population surveillance system in Matlab, 40 miles
southeast of the capital city of Bangladesh and
considered to be representative of rural Bangladesh
(Rahman et al., 1999; Rahman & Liu, 2000). The
Matlab surveillance system data have been used
extensively in the demographic literature and are
considered to be one of the few high-quality (i.e.,
complete, accurate, and up to date) data sources in
the developing world. In particular, age reporting is
considered to be highly accurate, which is a feature
not found in other South Asian data sources
(Menken & Phillips, 1990).
The multistage sampling was conducted as fol-
lows (Rahman et al., 1999). The Matab surveillance
Vol. 43, No. 6, 2003 857
area consists of 8,640 baris or residential compounds,
of which roughly one third (31.1%) or 2,687
baris were randomly sampled. The bari is the
basic unit of social organization in rural Bangladesh
and in Matlab in particular (Aziz, 1979; Rahman,
1986). Baris usually consist of a cluster of households
linked in many instances in a kin network (note,
however, that approximately 16% of baris consist
only of a single household, and even in multi-
household baris, kin networks may exist only for
subclusters of households). Sampling baris rather
than households provides a better representation of
family networks, a major focus of the MHSS. Within
each bari, up to two households were selected for
detailed interviews. Within each selected household,
all individuals aged 50 years and older were
interviewed. For those younger than 50, certain
criteria were followed to reduce the interviewing
load vis-a
` -vis large households.
For baris with two or fewer households, all
households were chosen. For baris with more than
two households, the first household was chosen at
random. The second household was selected from
the bari in order of preference as follows: (a) the
household of the father or mother of the head of the
first sampled household; (b) a household containing
a son of the head of the first sampled household
(chosen at random if there are multiple sons in
separate households in the bari); (c) a household
containing a brother of the head of the first sampled
household (chosen at random if there are multiple
brothers in separate households in the bari); and (d)
a second randomly selected household.
In this analysis we are concerned with the 3,054
individuals aged 50 years and older in the MHSS.
These individuals come from 1,985 baris out of the
2,687 sampled baris. Out of the 3,054 eligible
individuals, 484 had missing information on physical
disability (measured physical performance limita-
tions) and functional limitations (self-reported
ADLs). Thus, for the purposes of this study, we will
focus on 2,921 respondents aged 50 years and older
(1,505 men and 1,416 women) distributed in 1,783
baris for whom we have complete information.
Table 1 shows that, on key demographic and
health indicators, there appears to be little difference
between the 484 individuals with missing informa-
tion on physical performance and ADL limitations
and the 2,921 individuals in the final analysis sample.
To further explore the issue of the impact of
dropping the 484 individuals with missing informa-
tion from our final analysis sample, we conducted
multivariate analyses using all 3,054 eligible individ-
uals, and we coded the missing information on
observed physical activity and ADLs as distinct
unordered categories. Thus, in this expanded anal-
ysis, observed or measured physical activity was
coded as having one of three unordered possible
states: bad physical performance, missing physical
performance, or good physical performance, with
the latter being the reference category. In a similar
fashion, with regard to reported ADLs, we coded the
relevant groups as having major ADL limitations,
minor ADL limitations, missing ADL limitations, or
no ADL limitations (the latter being the reference
category). Note that no ordering of categories is
assumed; that is, the missing category is not
considered better or worse a priori than the other
possible states. The resulting multivariate models
that treat the missing category as a separate possible
state without any assumption or ordering do not
lead to any substantive change in our conclusions
compared with our results, which include just those
with complete information.
Variables
With regard to our health measures, we have one
objectively assessed indicator, physical disability
(assessed as measured physical performance), and
four self-reported measures, SRH, self-reported
functional limitations (ADLs), self-reported chronic
morbidity, and self-reported acute morbidity.
We assessed physical disability objectively as in
prior studies (Merrill, Seeman, Kasl, & Berkman,
1997; Rahman & Liu, 2000) by asking respondents to
perform four timed physical tasks: maintaining side
by side, semitandem, and tandem positions (bal-
ance); walking 8 feet, twice (gait); rising from a chair
(lower extremity movement); and rotating the
shoulder (upper extremity movement). Each task
had a three-level score, that is, 0 (unable to do the
activity), 1 (had some difficulty doing the activity),
and 2 (could do the activity easily), assigned by an
independent observer. We constructed an overall
summary measure of all performance tasks by
Table 1. Comparison Between Final Analysis Sample and Missing Observations

Notes: All calculations use sampling weights and correct for the multistage sampling design. SRH ¼ self-reported general
health; Obs. ¼ observations. Final sample consists of 2,921 individuals, from 1,783 clusters or baris. Missing observations are for
484 individuals from 411 clusters or baris. 95% confidence intervals are given parenthetically.

adding the four individual subscales, and this scale
ranged in value from 0 to 8, with higher scores
indicating better performance. Those with scores in
the range from 0 to 5 were labeled as having poor
physical performance, with the reference group being
those with scores 6 and above.
SRH was assessed with this item: ``What is your
current health status?'' Responses were scored as
good, fair, or bad. For analytic purposes, bad SRH
was coded as 1, with good or fair being coded as 0.
In the cultural context of this study population,
individuals even when they are in good health are
reluctant to classify themselves as being in good
health (because of the sense that ``it might attract the
attention of `the gods'''), and the tendency is to say
that one is in fair health. Thus the fair health
category in all likelihood is composed of a substantial
proportion of people in good health, and it seemed
reasonable to combine the fair and the good
categories, so that the dichotomy of poor versus fair
or good would provide the sharpest contrast.
Moreover, the dichotomous coding of poor versus
fair or good has been used in other published studies
(Wu & Rudkin, 2000). It is important to note,
however, that a different coding scheme (i.e., poor or
fair vs. good) would probably result in a less sharp
contrast and some attenuation in our results.
Following Merrill and colleagues (1997), and
Rahman and Liu (2000), we constructed a series of
measures for functional limitations (self-reported
ADLs). We used self-report information on 10 ADL
items, which were divided into two different clusters.
The first cluster included limitations in personal care
and consisted of four items: the ability to (a) bathe,
(b) dress, (c) get up and out of bed, and (d) use the
toilet. The second cluster included limitations in
range of motion and consisted of six items: the
ability to (a) carry a 10-kg weight for 20 yards, (b)
use a hand pump to draw water, (c) stand up from
a squatting position on the floor, (d) sit in a squatting
position on the floor, (e) get up from a sitting
position on a chair or stool without help, and (f)
crouch or stoop. Each cluster was summarized as 1
(can easily do all the activities in the cluster) or
0 (have trouble with one or more activities in the
cluster). Individuals who scored a 0 on both clusters
of ADLs were labeled as having major ADL
limitations. Those who had a score of 0 on the
range of motion limitation scale but scored a 1 on the
personal care limitation scale were labeled as having
a minor ADL limitation. Finally, those who scored
a 1 on both ADL clusters were labeled as having no
ADL limitations.
Self-reported chronic morbidity (Rahman et al.,
1999) was assessed with a checklist of 14 sentinel
conditions (anemia, arthritis, broken bones, cata-
racts, vision problems, asthma, other breathing
difficulty, diabetes, pain or burning on urination,
paralysis, tuberculosis, gastric or ulcer problems,
edema, and a residual category called ``other
conditions''). For each condition, respondents were
asked to report whether they had experienced it in
the 3 months prior to the survey, and if so whether it
had caused them no difficulty, some difficulty, a great
deal of difficulty, or an inability to carry out their
day-to-day activities. Those who reported none of
the 14 sentinel conditions were labeled as having no
chronic morbidity. Those who had experienced one
or more of the 14 conditions with some or no
difficulty in day-to-day activities were labeled as
having minor chronic disease. Finally, those who had
experienced 1 or more of the 14 sentinel conditions
that had caused a great deal of difficulty or inability
to carry out their day-to-day activities were labeled
as having severe chronic disease.
Self-reported acute morbidity (Rahman et al.,
1999) was assessed with a checklist of 12 sentinel
conditions (headache, eye infection, toothache, cold
and cough symptoms, vomiting and stomach aches,
fever with chills, watery diarrhea, diarrhea associ-
ated with mucus or blood, skin problems, accidental
trauma, excessive menstrual bleeding, and a residual
category called ``other conditions''). For each
condition, respondents were asked to report whether
they had experienced it in the 30 days prior to the
survey or not. Those reporting at least one of the
aforementioned conditions were labeled as having
acute morbidity. It is worth noting that, for both
self-reported acute and chronic morbidity, the
summary measures are composed of heterogeneous
categories of symptoms and disease labels that reflect
the prevailing morbid conditions in rural Bangla-
desh. They are locally specific, and cross-country
comparisons using these summary measures would
be difficult to interpret.
Data Analytic Plan
Because of the multistage nature of the sample,
individual observations have been weighted appro-
priately to reflect population representation (Rah-
man et al., 1999). We used binary weighted logistic
regression with sampling weights and adjustment for
intracluster (i.e., bari) correlations to examine the
interrelationship between SRH and various underly-
ing health indicators. These indicators included
observed physical performance; reported ADL lim-
itations (major and minor); chronic morbidity
(major and minor); acute morbidity; and self-
reported 1-year time trajectory of health. STATA
statistical software was used for all of the analyses
and the multistage design corrections (STATA,
1997a, 1997b).
Results
Table 1 shows that there were no significant
differences in various health indicators between the
484 missing observations and the 2,921 observations
Vol. 43, No. 6, 2003 859
used in the final analysis. The missing individuals are
slightly older, but they have the same mean values
for SRH, major and minor chronic morbidity, and
acute morbidity. These results support the notion
that dropping the 484 individuals with missing
observations has not biased the results from the
final analysis sample in any significant manner.
Table 2 shows that, for a variety of health
indicators, older individuals are generally more
likely to have poor health than their younger
counterparts and that for each age group women
are by and large more likely to have worse health
than men. Note that, in both Tables 1 and 2, all
calculations use sampling weights and correct for the
multistage sampling design of the survey (STATA,
1997a, 1997b).
In Table 3 we use weighted binary logistic
regression with adjustments for multistage sampling
to examine the determinants of SRH, focusing
initially on the impact of gender and age. As already
noted, the outcome variable is bad compared with
fair or good SRH. Table 3 shows that, unadjusted
for any other controls, there is a significant female
disadvantage in SRH: odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.71 (1.38,
2.12) for Model 1. Controlling for calendar age
actually increases the female disadvantage, OR ¼
1.94 (1.55, 2.44) for Model 2, as women are on
average younger than men in this study population
and SRH is worse for older individuals. The female
disadvantage in SRH is attenuated but persists after
controls for objectively measured physical perfor-
mance are added: OR¼1.73 (1.38, 2.18) for Model 3.
Subsequently the female disadvantage in SRH
further attenuates and becomes nonsignificant when
controls are added for self-reported ADLs and self-
reported chronic and acute morbidity: OR ¼ 0.78
(0.60, 1.02) for Model 4. Similarly, with regard to
age trends, when gender is controlled for, older
individuals are more likely to report poor health
than their younger peers in Model 2. This age effect
persists when controls are added for measured
physical performance but becomes statistically in-
significant when controls are added for different self-
reported health indicators. The results of the final
model (Model 4) show that several different
dimensions of health, such as physical disability
(poor observed physical performance), functional
limitations (self-reported major and minor ADL
limitations), and acute and chronic morbidity, have
independent impacts on SRH. Moreover, for ADLs
and chronic morbidity, there is a severity gradient in
the expected direction, with more severe conditions
having more of an impact on SRH than less severe
conditions. Finally, the results also indicate that
there is a negative interaction between some of the
different dimensions of health affecting SRH (i.e.,
ADL limitations and chronic morbidity). Thus the
impact of an ADL limitation on SRH is greatest
when the individual has no chronic morbidity. If the
individual already has some kind of chronic
morbidity, the addition of an ADL limitation does
not affect SRH quite as much as it would in the
absence of chronic morbidity. In a similar manner,
the impact of chronic morbidity on SRH is greatest
when the individual has no ADL limitation. If the
individual already has some kind of ADL limitation,
the addition of chronic morbidity does not affect
SRH as much as it would in the absence of an ADL
limitation. Finally, gender and age interactions for
each of these distinct health status indicators were
tested and were found not to be significant.
Discussion
Before we discuss our results, we believe it is
worth pointing out a number of salient caveats and

thetically. Worse health is in comparison to the year before. For men aged 50­59, 60­69, and 70þ, n ¼ 632, 569, and 304, respec-
tively; for 50þ (total), N ¼ 1,505 (cluster, bari ¼ 1,272). For women aged 50­59, 60­69, and 70þ, n ¼ 777, 455, and 184,
respectively; for 50þ (total), N ¼ 1,416 (cluster or bari ¼ 1,242).

860 The Gerontologist
limitations of this study. First, because of the cross-
sectional design and the subjective nature of many of
our independent variables (self-reports of: chronic
morbidity, ADL limitations, and acute morbidity),
the potential for bidirectionality between our in-
dependent variables and our outcomes cannot be
ruled out. Thus we are not able to make any
definitive cause and effect statements, and we are
limited to pointing out associations. Second, our
indicators of acute and chronic morbidity are
heterogeneous composites of self-reported symptoms
and disease labels (e.g., difficulty breathing and
anemia), which may not necessarily correspond to
objectively diagnosed disorders.
Keeping these caveats in mind, we find that our
results suggest SRH in our study population is
a multifaceted, nuanced indicator of underlying
health status that incorporates different dimensions
of health (physical disability--actual measured
physical performance; functional limitations--
reported limitations in ADLs, and chronic and acute
disease or symptom status), severity, and comorbid-
ity. The independent effects of different dimensions
of health point to the fact that there does not appear
to be a single pathway, such as functional limi-
tations, that determines self-reported health status
(Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993). The results with
regard to severity are noteworthy as they confirm
theoretical expectations that have not been tested
explicitly in most previous studies (Idler & Benya-
mini, 1997). Our findings with respect to comorbid-
ity are particularly interesting in that they show that
SRH is not merely an additive function of different
kinds of health risks. On the contrary, the marginal
impact of additional health risks on SRH diminishes
with each existing problem for this study population.
This result underscores the complex weighting
across various dimensions of health that underlies
SRH assessments (Idler & Benyamini, 1997).
As is the case in the developed world, we find
strong evidence of female disadvantage in SRH
status. In our sample, this female disadvantage does
not vary with age (i.e., there are no Age 3 Gender
interactions), and it persists (in an attenuated
fashion) when controls are added for objectively
measured physical performance. Subsequently, how-
ever, this female disadvantage appears to be fully
accounted for by the fact that women are more likely
to report more ADL limitations and more acute and
chronic morbidity. One might be tempted to argue
that these findings suggest that female disadvantages
in SRH reflect true gender differences in underlying
health status. However, in light of the fact that ADL
limitations and acute and chronic morbidity are
ultimately self-reported, and not objectively mea-
sured, one cannot rule out definitively that the
portion of the female disadvantage not explained by
observed physical performance ratings is a function
of differential reporting by gender. Although the
reporting bias issue remains unresolved, our results
do indicate that marginal changes in physical
disability, functional limitations, and acute and

chronic morbidity work in similar fashion in both
men and women to affect SRH in our sample.
We also explore the issue of whether the impact of
physical limitations on SRH is different for different
age groups in our sample. We focus on objectively
measured physical performance, which uses age
independent norms, and find that there are no
significant age interactions. Thus the same level of
absolute, objectively measured, physical performance
limitation affects SRH in the same manner in the old
old versus the young old. These results thus provide
an interesting contrast to studies in other social
settings, which have suggested that physical limita-
tions have a decreasing impact on SRH with
increasing age (Idler, 1993; Leinonen et al., 2001).
Earlier in this article, we posited that the relation-
ship between SRH and other health-related measures
may be different in the developing world than in the
developed world because of differences in levels of
knowledge about health conditions, differing expec-
tations about physical mobility, and differences in
social support. Although we are not able to explore
such differences explicitly, we are able to explore
gender differences in our study population, which
may mirror differences between the developing and
developed world. As women in this population have
less education and less contact with the health care
system than their male peers, one might expect that
proportionately more women than men would be
unaware of existing acute and chronic morbid
conditions. Thus this might be expected to lead to
a weaker association for women than for men
between acute and chronic morbidity and SRH
(provided acute and chronic morbidity have the same
theoretical impact on SRH for both men and
women). Gender differences were tested and were
not found to be significant.
In a similar vein, one could hypothesize that,
given the low levels of mobility outside the home
for women and the lower expectations for physical
strength and coordination in this society, objec-
tively measured physical limitations would have
less of an impact on SRH for women than for men.
This was tested for and no gender interaction was
found.
In conclusion, our analysis provides support for
the notion that, in our study population, easily
recorded SRH assessments incorporate many of the
properties one would want in a composite health
indicator, including multidimensionality, severity,
comorbidity, and trajectory. Moreover, SRH ap-
pears to be significantly correlated with a hard
objective measure of physical performance. Finally,
in contrast to some other settings, in rural Bangla-
desh there appears to be no evidence that the impact
of physical performance limitations on SRH is
different for women than for men and for older
individuals than for younger individuals.
It is hard to know to what extent our results hold
just for rural Bangladesh. Clearly, some of our
measures are locally specific (e.g., acute and chronic
morbidity summary measures). Moreover, as we have
already noted, there are in all likelihood different
degrees of knowledge about morbid conditions and
different behavioral expectations about health and
varying social support networks across different
societies. Further exploration of the generalizability
of our results will require parallel datasets from other
social or environmental settings that will allow us to
test directly for both differences and similarities in the
conceptualization of SRH measures.
