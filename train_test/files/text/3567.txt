Introduction
The classical renin angiotensin system (RAS) is demon-
strated to have an increasingly important role in ocular
pathology and homeostasis. It has been implicated in a
variety of eye diseases, including uveitis, macular degen-
eration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.1 Classical
RAS originates with renin (REN), an aspartyl protease
derived from its inactive precursor pro-renin, within the
juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney.
REN cleaves its substrate angiotensinogen (AGT), an
2 globulin produced by the liver, in order to form the
decapeptide angiotensin I (AngI). Subsequent cleavage of
Ang I by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE),
results in formation of angiotensin II (AngII), an important
vasoconstrictor, trophic, angiogenic and pro-inflammatory
octapeptide (Figure 1). ACE also metabolises bradykinin,
a powerful vasodilator involved in mediation of the inflam-
matory response. The RAS was initially considered to be a

Abstract
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the relative expression of clinically-relevant components of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the adult human eye.
Methods: We obtained 14 post-mortem enucleated human eyes from patients whom had no history of inflammatory
ocular disease nor pre-mortem ocular infection. We determined the gene expression for prorenin, renin, prorenin
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensinogen and angiotensin II Type 1 receptor, on tissue sections and in
cultured human primary retinal pigment epithelial and iris pigment epithelial (RPE/IPE) cell lines, using both qualitative and
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Protein expression was studied using indirect
immunofluorescence (IF).
Results: Almost all components of the classical RAS were found at high levels, at both the transcript and protein level,
in the eyes' uvea and retina; and at lower levels in the cornea, conjunctiva and sclera. There was a much lower level of
expression in the reference cultured RPE/IPE cells lines.
Conclusion: This study describes the distribution of RAS in the normal adult human eye and demonstrates the existence
of an independent ocular RAS, with uveal and retinal tissues showing the highest expression of RAS components. These
preliminary findings provide scope for examination of additional components of this system in the human eye, as well as
possible differential expression under pathological conditions.

classical endocrine system with activity restricted to sys-
temic effects; however, recent studies demonstrate local-
ised RAS within numerous tissues, such as the endothelium
of the vascular system, brain, adrenal glands, thymus and
reproductive tract. In addition, there is mounting molecu-
lar, biological and immunohistochemical evidence for a
localised RAS in the human eye.2­7 Subsequent work in
this area established not only the localised presence of all
the constituents of the RAS, but also their expression and
active transcription within human ocular tissue.3, 5, 8­10
Published data to date points to the existence of a local
RAS within the eye, independent of systemic precursor
substrates and peptides.11
It has been proposed that the intra-retinal RAS may
have a physiological role in the neurotransmission and
modulation of retinal ganglion cells.12 AngII appears to
have a multifaceted role in the physiology of the eye; and
studies demonstrate its influence on the vasculature of the
eye,13,14 aqueous humour outflow regulation and intraocu-
lar pressure (IOP) control.2,15 In addition, its presence in
certain types of neural cells in the retina, such as Müller
glial cells, has implicated AngII in ocular neuromodula-
tion of the pathogenesis of vasoproliferative disorders,
such as proliferative retinopathy,3,5,8,16,17 stimulating
VEGF-induced angiogenesis within the retina18­22 in dis-
ease states such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)23­25
and diabetic retinopathy.24 Plasma AngII is also believed
to play an important role in mediating the influence of sys-
temic RAS on intraocular RAS.26
RAS is also implicated in other disease processes in the
eye, including inflammatory disorders.27­30 AngII is shown
to enhance vascular permeability in an inflammatory set-
ting, predominantly through the induction of chemokines
and adhesion molecules, as well as being responsible for
recruitment of inflammatory cells.31 Inhibition of the RAS
was also demonstrated to have a neuroprotective effect in
glaucoma models, such as for ocular hypertension,32 reper-
fusion33 and deaxotomised retina explants.34
The aim of our study was to provide a comprehensive
picture of the RAS gene and protein expression patterns in
normal adult human ocular tissue, which will aid in target-
ing treatments for a variety of RAS-mediated eye diseases.
Materials and methods
Tissue specimens
We obtained 10 fresh and 5 fixed whole human eyes, post-
mortem, from the Lions NSW Eye Bank in Sydney,
Australia. Informed consent was obtained. The experimen-
tal protocols followed the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki and the study was approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee of the University of NSW.
The cornea and conjunctiva of the 10 fresh eye speci-
mens had been removed for use in corneal graft surgery;
therefore, these tissues were unavailable for RT-PCR test-
ing. Exclusion criteria for all specimens were having
inflammatory ocular disease and pre-mortem ocular infec-
tion. Other ocular comorbidities are noted in Tables 1 and
2. We did not have detailed information on systemic
comorbidities of the donors, beyond what was relevant for
transplant safety. Tables 1 and 2 highlight the clinical fea-
tures of the 15 cases.
Tissue dissection
Enucleation of the globe was performed post-mortem by
an ophthalmic surgeon. The surgeon cut a further circular
incision around the eyeball, slightly anterior to the inser-
tion of the lateral rectus muscle, to remove the cornea and
bulbar conjunctiva for corneal transplant/graft purposes.
Upon enucleation and removal of the cornea and conjunc-
tiva for use by the Eye Bank, further tissue dissection was
carried out under an optical microscope, to minimise any
tissue-to-tissue contamination. The iris, ciliary body, neu-
ral retina, RPE and attached choroid were dissected from
the globe, sliced into fine pieces and placed into individual
eppendorf tubes for ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction.
The entire ciliary body and iris (approximately 50 ­ 100
mg each) were small enough to only need one tube each;
however, the whole retina and choroid (approximately 200
mg each) were split across three tubes each, due to the
larger amount of these tissues in the eye. A sample of
approximately 100 mg in weight of sclera was also used.
Cell cultures
We purchased human primary IPE and RPE cells with epi-
thelial cell medium from ScienCell Research Laboratories
(San Diego, CA) and cultured them as previously

described.35 Two control cell lines, THP1 (a human acute
monocytic leukaemia cell line) and SKBR3 (a breast can-
cer cell line) were donated in the form of freshly extracted
RNA by the ocular immunology group at the University of
NSW, Kensington.
RT-PCR methods
Total RNA was extracted from both the post-mortem tis-
sues and cell lines, and DNase treated. We isolated RNA,
performing reverse transcription and PCR with SYBR
green dye. A total of 50 positive (RT +) and 50 negative
(RT ­) samples were available for RT-PCR, from five ocu-
lar tissue samples from each of the 10 donor eyes. We con-
structed positive control standard curves for relative
quantification. We used the standard curve method for
relative quantification, to calculate unknown sample
expression as a fold expression over the endogenous con-
trol gene (GAPDH).
We performed PCR for the AGTR1 Transcript 5 (AT1
receptor) gene on synthesised cDNA, in accordance with
the Quantace SensiMix protocol (Bioline, Sydney,
Australia). As the primer set used produced an amplicon
too large for RT-PCR, we used qualitative PCR for the
AGTR1 transcript variant 5 gene, instead of quantitative
RT-PCR. We ran the amplified products from the AGTR1
PCR in a 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE).
Immunohistochemical analysis
Whole eyes (n = 4) obtained from the Lions Eye Bank
were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 3 ­ 5 days
and then processed overnight (VIP Tissue Processor,
Olympus, Notting Hill, VIC, Australia). The whole eyes
were then paraffin embedded and sectioned.
IPE and RPE cells at passage 4'were cultured in epithe-
lial cell medium to confluence in chamber slides. The cells
were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then
fixed in 25% v/v methanol, 25% v/v acetone and 50% v/v
reverse osmosis water for 10 minutes, followed by Tris
buffered saline (TBS) washes prior to the immunostaining
procedure detailed below.
Immunofluorescence staining was performed on 5µm
thick paraffin sections, mounted on coated slides (Vision
BioSystems, Melbourne, Australia; Leica MicroSystems,
Sydney, Australia), and allowed them to dry overnight in an
oven set at 37oC. Paraffin slides from each eye were depar-
affinised and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed
in a microwave, using Epitope Retrieval Solution pH 6.0
(Novacastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) for 10 minutes (3
mins at 100% power and 4 mins at 50% power). All the

sections were then incubated in 2% skim milk powder in
TRIS buffer, to minimise non-specific binding. All tissue
sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies
(list in Table 3) overnight, at 4°C. Sections were washed in
buffer (Novacastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) and fol-
lowed by incubation with secondary antibodies that
included: goat anti-mouseAlexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen, CA,
USA), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, CA,
USA), goat anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen,
CA,USA)anddonkeyanti-goatAlexaFluor594(Invitrogen,
CA, USA). Sections were treated with 0.03% Sudan black
for 2 mins and washing in running water, before mounting
with Prolong Gold antifade media.
Images were taken using the Olympus Fluoview pro-
gram and original slides were imaged using a confocal
microscope (Olympus FV1000 Inverted Laser Scanning
Microscope).
Results
Gene expression
Qualitative and quantitative RT-PCR.Qualitative PCR
showed the AGTR1-transcript for the AT1
receptor to be
present in RPE choroid samples from donor eyes only
(Figure 2). Quantitative PCR was used to determine the
relative expression of ACE, AGT, REN/prorenin and
prorenin receptor (ATP6AP2) genes. Only ocular samples
which expressed levels of GAPDH (the control gene)
above the detectable limit of the assay in three or more
samples were quantified. Relative gene expression as a
fold difference in reference to the calibrator samples was
calculated. The relative expression of these genes is shown
in Figure 3.
Patterns and locations of protein
immunoreactivity
Protein expression and localisation of RAS components
(AGT, prorenin, prorenin receptor, ACE and AT1
receptor)
within ocular tissue was determined using indirect immu-
nofluorescence. Figure 4 is representative of the staining
obtained for each of the RAS components tested in the eye.
In this case, we show staining for the AT1
receptor across
the eye.
The staining was assessed semi-quantitatively by
three independent observers (other staff in the lab uncon-
nected to the project) looking at the images with their
naked eyes, on the computer screen. A score of `0' was
given for no staining visible, `1' for some staining and
`2' for intense staining. The benchmark to decide what
constituted no staining or maximum staining was based
on control (non-eye) tissues, which had no discernible
staining or diffuse, intense staining, respectively. We
chose the control tissues based on tissues where that pro-
tein was known to exist, such as REN in the kidney. The
scores for each individual slide were then averaged to
get a total mean score between 0 ­ 2 for each slide.
Figure 5 shows how intensity scoring was derived in the
control samples.

Discussion
This is the first study to catalogue the expression patterns of
prorenin, REN, the prorenin receptor, angiotensinogen,ACE
and the AT1
receptor in the human eye, at both the transcript
and protein levels. Previous studies on RAS in the human
eye looked at mRNA expression only, and not across all
structures of the eye.3 The presence and active transcription
of genes encoding RAS proteins, within different types of
eye tissue, are further evidence of a localised RAS in the eye.
Importantly, this study demonstrated a strong expression
of RAS mRNA and protein in uveal and retinal tissues,
relative to the corneoscleral layer. This finding has impor-
tant implications in uveo-retinal disease, as these tissues
are more likely to produce angiotensin in large amounts.
The proinflammatory, profibrotic, mitogenic and vasocon-
strictor properties of angiotensin II, which contribute to
vascular and inflammatory disease by altering vascular
tone, structural remodelling and endothelial dysfunc-
tion36­38 are likely to be the same mechanisms that promote
many RAS-related diseases of the eye.
Almost all layers of the retina were positive for RAS
proteins, which correlates with previous findings of a
neuromodulatory or possible neurotransmitter role for
angiotensin II in the retina.8,16 The modulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation via an AT1
R-mediated
mechanism, demonstrated in in vitro glaucoma models to
confer a neuroprotective effect, lends weight to this
hypothesis.33,34 ROS `bursts' are implicated as a trigger
mechanism for apoptotic cascades in the eye and optic
nerve.34,39
Human RPE and IPE cell cultures showed either low or
no expression of the RAS constituents at either transcript
or protein levels. Contributing factors could include differ-
ences between functionality in the in vitro and in vivo set-
ting, the conditions under which the cells were cultured
and the presence of other cell types within the epithelial
layer being the source of RAS proteins.

There are important limitations to this study. There
were significant variations in expression of RAS compo-
nents between donors. The medication histories of our
donors were unavailable; and therefore, the effects of med-
ications that could have influenced the results of this study
are unknown. The impact of anti-RAS medications, such
as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists, on
ocular tissues may explain significant differences in pro-
tein expression. RNA degradation in the RPE and other
ocular tissues, due to the time between donor death and
tissue processing (mean time: 11.9 h) may have also been
a factor. Furthermore, only a total of 15 human eyes were
available for this exploratory study. A much larger sample
size would overcome many of these difficulties, as well as
allow a direct comparison between RAS expression levels
in healthy and diseased eyes.
