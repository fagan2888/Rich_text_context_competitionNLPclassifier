Abstract
This article presents a content analysis of five very different examples of participatory
journalism. The goal of this study is to examine the, largely untested, assumptions that
news organizations and journalists have about audience input (audience material for
instance being trivial, personal, emotional and sensational). We systematically ask how
the contents of the five projects might be characterized in relation to conventional
quality journalism as a particular genre by examining the contents against two criteria
that have been critical to this genre: `objectivity' and `diversity'. Second, given the
core role that a notion of professional `control' plays in discussions on participatory
journalism, we examine whether these manifestations on objectivity and diversity are
associated with the degree to which professional journalists have control over the
participatory content published within these projects. By doing so, we aim to better
understand what the participating audience produces in order to get an idea of what,
according to participants, `counts' as journalism and to determine whether and how

Introduction
`Participatory journalism'has been anticipated as a form of journalism in which the audi-
ence no longer `merely' receives news, but, enabled by digital technologies, is involved
in its production and dissemination (Bowman and Willis, 2003). Viewed from a sociol-
ogy of professions' perspective, participatory news environments can be considered
places of `boundary work', where the boundaries of conventional journalism are chal-
lenged (Lewis, 2012; Robinson, 2010; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2015). The potential rise of the
audience as producer of news challenges journalism to rethink its professional identity,
conventional understandings of its function in society and key principles ­ such as objec-
tivity and diversity ­ that are conventionally associated with professional journalistic
quality. In short, participatory journalism forces professional journalists to reconsider the
building blocks through which they have claimed their expertise, social authority and
public legitimacy (Lewis, 2012: 841­842). News organizations and journalists have
taken a hesitant attitude towards a participating audience, fearing a loss of journalistic
quality (Singer, 2010). The assumption is that the audience would, for instance, have a
preference for personal, trivial or sensational topics and take up a subjective, emotional
style, all of which is considered incompatible with `journalism' (Borger et al., 2013b;
Costera Meijer, 2012; Singer, 2010).
Participatory journalism has been explored from various angles, but studies that exam-
ine participatory content have remained scarce. Existing content analyses concentrate on
(hyper)local forms of participatory journalism, focusing on neighbourhoods or cities, and
compare these to professional journalism (Carpenter, 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Fico et al.,
2013; Karlsson and Holt, 2014; Paulussen and D'heer, 2013). These studies demonstrate
that, generally, this type of participatory journalistic content is indeed less objective than
professional journalism and does not show more diversity. However, participatory jour-
nalism is not a homogeneous phenomenon. Journalism practitioners have constructed dif-
ferent forms of participatory journalism, granting participants with varying roles and
rights (Borger et al., 2013b), which leads to varied expectations and evaluations of taking
part in journalism on the side of participants (Borger et al., 2015). Studies found notions
of (editorial) control and professional autonomy to be key in this regard (Borger et al.,
2013b; Lewis, 2012; Robinson, 2007; Williams et al., 2010). In general, journalists
respond to audience participation by `reasserting control' (Lewis, 2012: 850), finding it
difficult to abandon their traditional role as `gatekeepers' of the news (Singer, 2010).
However, control by professional journalists over participatory content is not as strong in
all participatory environments (Borger et al., 2013b). Typically, it is exercised less in local
Borger et al. 3
initiatives. Here, content autonomy, conventionally an important professional journalistic
value (Singer, 2007), is transferred to participants. This raises the question of whether the
results from existing content analyses are representative for participatory journalism
beyond the (hyper)local, since studies that examine how more diverse types of participa-
tory journalism (including both high and low content control/autonomy variations) impact
on the characteristics of the content they produce are lacking.
The goal of this study is to examine the, largely untested, assumptions that news
organizations and journalists have about audience input through an analysis of participa-
tory content. First, we investigate the content of a wider variety of participatory journal-
istic projects, including and beyond the (hyper)local. Second, we systematically ask how
these various forms might be characterized in relation to conventional quality journalism
as a particular genre (Costera Meijer, 2001), examining them against two content criteria
that have been critical to this genre: `objectivity' and `diversity'. By doing so, we aim to
better understand what the participating audience produces in order to grasp what,
according to participants, `counts' as journalism (Deuze, 2005) and in order to establish
if and how this differs from conventional quality journalism.
Objectivity and diversity as cornerstones of professional ideology in
Western journalism
There is a broad consensus that 20th-century journalism in Western countries has been
characterized by a `professional model' (see Schudson and Anderson, 2009) that centred
on the idea of a trained professional gathering and disseminating objectively validated
information to the public (McNair, 2009: 347). Over the course of the 20th century, this
model became increasingly institutionalized through the forming of professional institu-
tions and codes of practice (Schudson and Anderson, 2009), and the development of a
professional ideology, consisting of a set of values to which journalists in all media
types, genres and formats refer in the context of their daily work (Deuze, 2005: 445).
Objectivity has long been considered a core tenet of this professional ideology. Although
interpretations of objectivity vary across countries (Deuze, 2005), over time and journal-
istic subgenres (Wahl-Jorgensen, 2013), journalists in elective democracies worldwide
consider themselves as committed to providing `objective' information (Deuze, 2005).
Objectivity as a core value translates into the idea that, as long as journalists follow dep-
ersonalized and rationalized procedures, `a true account of reality can be presented'
(Broersma, 2010: 27). Others have demonstrated how the objectivity standard is also a
`strategic ritual' (Tuchman, 1972), rooted in organizational demands to avoid libel suits
and meet deadlines (p. 664).
In this article, we are interested in the collection of content characteristics that are the
consequence of both professional ideology and organizational requirements. Professional
journalists, following the objectivity norm, tend to (1) rely on quotations from external
(official) sources as a procedure that removes journalists'own subjectivity from the story,
thereby supporting their claim to truth (Tuchman, 1972: 668) and (2) exclude personal
views and values from their reporting, which results in journalism's hallmark neutral style
that avoids subjective language by the journalist (Broersma, 2010). In categorizing the
`subjectivity'of journalistic language, Carpenter (2008a) applied an intuitive approach by
4 Journalism 
classifying articles as `mostly fact' or `mostly opinion' (p. 538). The linguistic approach
of Vis (2011) offers a more quantifiable and exact measure. Vis measured change in the
expression of subjectivity in four Dutch newspapers between 1950 and 2002. She under-
stands as subjective `all expressions of beliefs, attitudes and opinions of a speaking or
writing subject, and his attention to himself and to the addressee' (p. 17). Thus, expres-
sions are subjective when they represent a speaking subject's evaluations (rather than
facts) as well as the speaking subject's explicit references to herself or himself (rather than
implying herself or himself while referring to the world outside).
`Objectivity' as a core norm and distinctive content characteristic of professional
journalism is associated with `diversity' as another core tenet of quality journalism.
Where the objectivity norm prescribes that journalists rely on external sources, a sense
of `doing it for the public' (Deuze, 2005: 453) requires that journalists do so in a manner
that guarantees the representation of a diversity of points of view and perspectives, for
ideally, the media reflect the `prevailing differences of culture, opinion and social condi-
tions of the population as a whole' (McQuail, 1992: 144). Media diversity is considered
vital for processes of political deliberation and discussions among citizens, since the
greater variety in offer (Van Hoof et al., 2014) of journalistic information, the better the
needs of a diverse citizenry are served.
Diversity has been approached as a principle in government's broadcast policy
(Benson, 2005), emphasizing, for example, diversity of newsroom staff or diversity in
media economy, or as a journalistic procedure ensuring a balanced and representative
account (Broersma, 2010). As a content characteristic, diversity is typically measured
not only in terms of source diversity but also in terms of diversity of topics or frames
present in media content (Carpenter, 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Voakes et al., 1996), or in
terms of news values (Paulussen and D'heer, 2013). Following Carpenter (2008a, 2008b,
2010) and Voakes et al. (1996), we approach diversity as a content characteristic, cap-
tured as variety in offer of topics covered of sources used. Following Paulussen and
D'heer (2013), this conceptualization is complemented by variety in offer of news values
that influence news selection.
Participatory journalism: Repairing a democratic deficit?
Professional understandings of objectivity and diversity have a paradoxical relation to jour-
nalistic quality: on the one hand, they are inextricably linked with an idea of what constitutes
good journalism, but on the other hand, they have been criticized as obstacles to producing
just that. Especially the `routinization'(McQuail, 1992: 184) of the objectivity norm and its
impact on the diversity ideal has attracted fierce criticism. Journalism's professional quality
logic dictates the following of fixed procedures to establish impartiality (Costera Meijer,
2012: 6), which results in a `ritual airing of different views'(Maras, 2013: 87) and a prefer-
ence for easily accessible, official (institutional) sources (Shoemaker and Reese, 1996). As
a consequence, professional interpretations of objectivity have been observed to limit the
diversity of news content, constrain understanding of issues presented in the news, thereby
leaving the audience less involved (Costera Meijer, 2012; Rosen, 1999).
With the advent of participatory journalism, scholars and media observers have antici-
pated that a greater involvement of the public might lead to a break with professional
understandings of objectivity and diversity. Participants might not be aware of professional
Borger et al. 5
ideals or simply have different concerns, and they would not be constrained by organiza-
tional demands and professional routines (Carpenter, 2008a; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2015).
Participatory journalism could harbour a move towards a more personal and subjective
style and an increase in the diversity of news content (Allan, 2013: 121), and, as such, has
been ascribed the potential to re-engage the audience in politics and public life (Nip, 2006).
Over the past decade, however, scholars'initial enthusiasm about the potential of participa-
tory journalism has shifted to disappointment, seeing that professional journalists adhere to
professional control over content and the audience is less eager to participate than initially
hoped for (Borger et al., 2013a).
Participatory content: Subjective and soft?
Studies investigating (hyper)local participatory content (Carpenter, 2008a, 2008b, 2010;
Fico et al., 2013; Karlsson and Holt, 2014; Paulussen and D'heer, 2013) examined various
aspects of objectivity and diversity. The mutual finding is that (hyper)local participatory
journalism takes a different approach when measured against professional journalism.
Regarding objectivity, participatory journalism has been found to include more author
opinion (Carpenter, 2008a), and use fewer sources to `objectively' describe news events
(Carpenter, 2008a; Fico et al., 2013; Karlsson and Holt, 2014), thus shifting towards a
more subjective reporting style.
Regarding diversity in terms of topics covered, participants have been observed to
cover `soft' news topics such as entertainment, culture, sports and health, while leaving
`hard' news categories such as crimes, fires and accidents to professionals (Carpenter,
2010; Fico et al., 2013; Karlsson and Holt, 2014; Paulussen and D'heer, 2013). Regarding
source use, scholars have demonstrated that participants use different sources than that
used by professionals: participants show a greater reliance on personal experience (i.e.
author as source) and first-hand witnessing (Paulussen and D'heer, 2013: 597) and on
unofficial sources (Carpenter, 2008a, 2008b; Fico et al., 2013; Paulussen and D'heer,
2013). Participants thus give voice to different actors partaking in news events than pro-
fessionals. Regarding the news values underlying news selection, participants have been
observed to give primacy to `soft' news values such as consonance, cultural relevance,
reference to persons, self-promotion, good news and emotion, while professionals were
guided by `hard' news values such as unexpectedness, public relevance, negativity and
recency (Paulussen and D'heer, 2013).
Summarizing then, studies of (hyper)local participatory content conclude that partici-
patory journalism makes a contribution to the media landscape that is different from
professional journalism, featuring relatively subjective and soft contents (Fico et al.,
2013; Karlsson and Holt, 2014; Paulussen and D'heer, 2013).
Approach
Empirical studies reveal news organizations and journalists that experiment with audience
participation as being caught in a tension between professional control and digital tech-
nologies' logic of open participation (Lewis, 2012; see also Domingo et al., 2008; Singer,
2010; Williams et al., 2010). In a previous study (Borger et al., 2013b), we demonstrated
that the dilemma between professional control and open participation is differently
6 Journalism 
negotiated in various forms of participatory journalism, granting participants with different
roles and rights. Our assumption is that the extent to which either professional journalists
or participants have control over content impacts the type of participatory content that is
published. In this article, we therefore investigate the content of five very different partici-
patory journalistic initiatives, each of which occupies a different position on the scale of
control over content by professional journalists to control over content by participants. We
examine how these examples of participatory journalism manifest themselves on key vari-
ables traditionally associated with quality journalism, that is, objectivity and diversity. We
conceptualized objectivity as (1) relying on external sources and (2) excluding personal
views and values by avoiding the use of subjective language. We conceptualized diversity
as the variety in offer of topics covered, sources used and news values underlying news
selection. This results in the following research questions:
RQ1a. To what extent do content characteristics of various participatory journalistic
initiatives reflect a more objective versus a more subjective reporting style?
RQ1b. Is the reporting style (objective vs subjective) associated with the degree of
professional control over content?
RQ2a. How diverse are various participatory journalistic initiatives with regard to
topics, sources and news values?
RQ2b. Is diversity of topics, sources and news values associated with the degree of
professional control over content?

Selection of participatory initiatives
Our study employs quantitative analysis of 741 items from five participatory journalistic
initiatives from the Netherlands. The projects were selected based on their great variety in
the level of freedom granted to participants in the production and publication of content
versus the level of control over the production and publication process exerted by profes-
sional journalists involved in the initiative. These characteristics were the results of a
systematic analysis of interviews with professionals involved in a wide range of participa-
tory projects in the Netherlands (see Borger et al., 2013b). The column `Description of
participant role' in Table 1 describes what aspects of production and publication of con-
tent were exercised by participants, and what aspects were appointed to the domain of
professional journalists. Together, the selected five initiatives reflect a great variety ­ in
terms of professional control, type of participant role, geographical scale, revenue model
and type of organization that initiated the project ­ that can be found among participatory
journalistic initiatives in the field. As such, the selected projects can be considered repre-
sentative for participatory journalism in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2014.
Selection of items
From each project, the most recent 150 items as of 12 November 2014 were selected in
order to allow for a detailed description of the content. This number was set for practical

reasons: One of the projects, NOSNet, did not contain more participatory items and we
wanted the same number of items from every project. Given the purposes of our com-
parative content analysis, we concentrated on textual aspects of the items, entailing that,
in the case of U in de Wijk, the first 2minutes of video items were transcribed.
Operationalization of the variables
Objectivity.Objectivity was conceptualized as (1) relying on sources and (2) keeping
personal views and values out by avoiding the use of subjective language. Conceptual-
izing objectivity as the absence of subjective language, we measured the deviation from
objectivity by identifying the amount of subjective language used. Following Vis (2011),
we first determined who expressed a piece of text: the (professional or participant) author
or an external source. Direct quotations were labelled as `source text'; all other text was
considered `author text'. Next, we used Vis' model of subjectivity indicators (Appendix
1) to identify all subjective words in the `source text' and `author text'. All texts were
annotated automatically for part of speech and lemma information.1 After all annotations
were completed, a sample of 5
per cent of the corpus per participatory project was
checked manually for words that occurred in double linguistic forms and meanings. The
number of subjective words per project was subsequently weighed by the error rate,
expressed as a percentage of wrongly annotated subjective words per project.
Regarding source use, we followed the example of Carpenter (2008a, 2008b, 2010),
also followed by Paulussen and D'heer (2013). Carpenter (2008a) defines a source as a
`provider of attributed textual information'(p. 538). Note that this can also be a reference
to the author himself. We identified all sources in the text by means of direct verbs of
attribution (e.g. `said', `reported', `stated' and `noted') and indirect verbs of attribution
(e.g. `hopes', `feels' and `believes'), and then counted all sources used per item per pro-
ject. Reliance on sources was, thus, measured as the total number of sources used per
project.
Diversity. We conceptualized diversity as the variety in offer of news topics, references to
type of sources and type of news values per project.
Regarding the topics of the content that participants produce, we followed Paulussen
and D'heer's (2013) distinction between hard and soft news topics. For each item, the
central topic that received most attention in the body of the text was coded. The coders2
chose from a list of 27 societal domains. This categorization was based on Van Hoof's
(2000) listing of 27 societal domains that reflect how professional journalists select and
present news items. In order to establish an interpretable overview, these 27 categories
were, according to their internal coherence, divided into five supercategories: `hard pub-
lic policy', `politics', `public event', `soft public policy' and `personal domain'. For a
detailed account of these categories, see Appendix 2.
Diversity of hard/soft news topics was measured as entropy in number equivalents,3 a
measure for open diversity (Kleinnijenhuis, 2003). Open diversity means that the maxi-
mum level of diversity is reached when all categories are given equal attention and the
minimum level when all attention is given to only one category. This open diversity
measure is based on the proportion of the total amount of attention that each of the
Borger et al. 9
categories received across the projects. We transformed the proportion in such a way that
diversity is 0 when all attention goes to only one category (meaning there is no diversity)
and 1, when the attention is equally distributed over all categories (i.e. perfect diversity),
from an open perspective (see Note 3), so that we can compare variables with a different
number of categories on the same scale.
Regarding source type use, we further followed the example of Carpenter (2008a,
2008b, 2010) and Paulussen and D'heer (2013). Having already identified all sources per
item for the purposes of determining the reliance on sources (see `objectivity'), we now
determined the type of sources that were used. First, we distinguished between author
source and external source (see above). Author source was operationalized as first-hand
witnessing and personal experience, that is, explicit references to the ideas, opinions,
experiences or observations of the author himself/herself. Furthermore, a distinction was
made between official (i.e. sources speaking on behalf of an organization) and unofficial
sources (sources speaking on their own behalf) and collective and individual identities.An
`undecided' category was created for sources that could not be categorized otherwise.
Diversity of source type was measured in the same way as diversity of topics, that is,
as entropy in number equivalents, comprising five categories.
Concerning news values, we adapted the example of Paulussen and D'heer (2013),4
resulting in the following list of 10: `threshold', `unexpectedness', `personalization',
`negativity', `recency', `elite/power', `good news', `emotion', `usefulness', `promotion'
(see Appendix 3 for definitions). The news values were recorded at the article level as
being present (1) or absent (0). In order to establish an interpretable overview, these 10
criteria were clustered into two main categories, conform Paulussen and D'heer's (2013)
observation that in hyperlocal participatory journalism, news values follow the distinc-
tion between soft and hard news topics. News values were measured at the level of the
news item.
Diversity of news values was, again, measured as entropy in number equivalents. We
present diversity of news values both in the dichotomous hard­soft news value variable
and in the 10 categories news values variable.
Coding procedures
A content analysis was conducted on the selected items. Subjective language use was
measured by means of automated content analysis. All other variables were measured by
means of manual coding, using AmCAT (Amsterdam Content Analysis Toolkit, cf. Van
Atteveldt, 2008). To this end, a code book was developed by the main researcher and, for
clarity of the instructions and uniformity of the categories used, tested by four trained
coders (see Note 2). The main researcher coded 300 items; the other coders each coded
just over 100 items.
Reliability
Five coders performed the coding. To establish intercoder reliability, the five coders all
coded 5per cent of the total sample. Krippendorff's (2004)  amounts to .74 for central
topic, .99 for number of sources per item, .77 for type of sources, which are acceptable
10 Journalism 
to very good values. The Krippendorff's  for the dichotomous news value variables
ranged from .49 for personalization to 1 for threshold. Although Krippendorff's  is very
strict for dichotomous variables with a skewed distribution (Fretwurst, 2015), the low
intercoder reliability for some of the news values implies that findings in this particular
regard need to be interpreted with some caution. We decided not to exclude these news
values from the analysis because the concepts are useful for exploration. The main coder
checked and adjusted the codings of the other coders. So, the final data for news values
that we used in the analysis were uniformly coded. We regarded this as the best possible
solution to obtain the exploratory goal of this study.
Results
Reporting style
RQ1 asked (1) to what extent the content characteristics of various participatory journal-
istic initiatives reflect a more objective versus a more subjective reporting style and (2)
whether the reporting style is associated with the degree of professional control over
content. First, the number of external sources used is discussed; next, the use of subjec-
tive language is addressed.
Table 2 shows the average number of external sources used per item for all projects.
Project Dichtbij, where professional control is least strong, showed the lowest average
number of external sources per item (0.63 per item); while NOSNet, where professional
control is strongest, showed the highest (7.88 per item). The other projects, with stronger
levels of professional control than Dichtbij, show higher number of sources per item but
below the level of external source use on NOSNet. Analysis of Variance revealed that
there was a significant linear trend, F(736, 4)=78,783; p<.05.
Subjective language use is presented as the number of subjective words used per pro-
ject as a percentage of the total number of words per project (Figure 1). The relative use
of subjective language is a better measure to compare the five projects, since the length
of the items varies per item and per project. Figure 1 shows three main results. First, as
professional control increases, projects are less subjective. Second, as professional con-
trol increases, the author is less subjective. In this regard, there is a crossover point at The
Post Online, where sources become more subjective than the author. Total subjectivity

and author subjectivity are lowest on NOSNet, the project characterized by strongest
professional control. Third, Dichtbij deviates from these general trends. Figure 1 shows
that in this project, professional control is least strong, but total subjectivity is lowest and
source subjectivity highest. This deviant pattern can be explained by the fact that source
text is scarce in the items of this project.
In summary then, as professional control increases, the reporting style moves towards
traditional interpretations of objectivity: there is a stronger reliance on external sources
and ­ with the exception of Dichtbij ­ a decrease in subjective language use in general
and in author subjectivity more specifically. Dichtbij can be typified as being farthest
from traditional journalism in the sense that hardly any sources are used, which also
explains the deviant pattern in terms of subjective language use.
Diversity
RQ2 asked (1) how diverse various participatory journalistic initiatives are with regard
to topics, sources and news values and (2) whether diversity of topics, sources and news
values are associated with the degree of professional control over content. We first
address both questions in relation to the topics covered, and then move on to source use
and news values.
Topics
Figure 2 shows the attention that the five topic categories receive in each of the projects.
Taking all projects together, hard news (57.8%) is covered more often than soft news (42.2%).
Most covered by far is the category `hard public policy'(44.7%). `Public events'are covered

the least (2.3%). The difference between the projects is significant (2(16)=228,161; p<.00),
and the strength of the association is modest (Cramer's V=.28; p<.00).
As professional control increases, the share of hard news increases and soft news
decreases: on Dichtbij, hard news accounts for 48.7per cent of the items and soft news
for 51.3per cent; on U in de Wijk, the division is 56per cent and 44per cent; on The Post
Online, hard and soft news measure 69.7 and 30.3
per cent, respectively. On NOSNet,
hard news is overtly dominant (93.6%). Figure 3 shows the diversity in topics per pro-
ject, both in terms of the five subcategories and in terms of the two main categories, hard
and soft news. With regard to both measures, there is a general pattern of diversity
decreasing as professional control over content increases. Diversity is higher when
measured against two categories, but not perfectly linear, since De Jaap (.72) scores
lower than The Post Online (.85). Diversity is highest in the project where professional
control is weakest, that is, Dichtbij (.64 and 1). The smallest diversity is achieved in the
project where professional control is strongest, that is, NOSNet (.38 and .27).
In summary then, as professional control is stronger and participants have less auton-
omy to decide what to write, topic diversity decreases.
Source use

witnessing by the author. The latter accounts for only 15.8
per cent of all source use;
official sources (official collective identity plus official individual identities) account for
48.9per cent of all source use, while unofficial sources take up 28.8per cent. The differ-
ences between the projects are significant (2(16)=574,723; p<.00) and the strength of
the association is modest (Cramer's V=.22; p<.00).

In all projects, there is a stronger reliance on external sources than on first-hand wit-
nessing or personal experience by the author. However, the extent to which participants
rely on personal experience or first-hand witnessing decreases as professional control
over content increases: in Dichtbij, 33
per cent of all source use consists of personal
experience or first-hand witnessing by the author, in U in de Wijk 23.5per cent, in De
Jaap it is 21.9per cent, in The Post Online this is 16.4per cent and in NOSNet 6.5per
cent.
The use of official and unofficial sources was not associated with professional control
over content. The use of official sources takes up more than half of all source use on
Dichtbij (52.2%), The Post Online (61.6%) and NOSNet (57.6%), and measures around
a third of all source use in De Jaap (34.6%) and U in de Wijk (32.8%). Furthermore,
source use in U in de Wijk, De Jaap and NOSNet is characterized by a considerable share
of unofficial individuals (43.6%, 29.8% and 31.2%, respectively). U in de Wijk, which
entails video items, differs from the other projects in that participants do not rely on
official collective identities.
Figure 5 shows source diversity per project. The project where professional control
is least strong, that is, Dichtbij, and the project where professional control is strongest,
that is, NOSNet, have approximately the same measure of diversity (.75 and .77,
respectively). In U in de Wijk, source diversity is lower (.49) than in Dichtbij and
NOSNet. De Jaap and The Post Online both have greater source diversity (.94 and .88,
respectively). Thus, these results do not suggest that source diversity is associated with
professional control over content, but findings did demonstrate that participants are
less likely to rely on personal experience or first-hand witnessing when professional
control is stronger.

News values
Figure 6 shows the use of news values per project. Taking all projects together, the divi-
sion between hard and soft news values is nearly 50­50. On the hard side, recency and
negativity are used most often (22% and 16%, respectively); on the soft side, personali-
zation and good news prevail (21% and 10%, respectively).
Significant differences between the projects exist for all news values. In general, the
share of hard news values increases and that of soft news values decreases when profes-
sional control over content is stronger. U in de Wijk deviates from this general trend as it
has a lower share of hard news values (22%) as compared to Dichtbij (35%). Regarding
hard news values, the figures show that recency is important in all projects, regardless of
professional control over content. Furthermore, as professional control increases, so does
the occurrence of the values `elite/power' and `negativity'. With regard to the use of soft
news values, a few things stand out: in Dichtbij, the three news values that are used most

often are `good news' (20%), `promotion' (22%) and `usefulness' (22%). In contrast to
other projects, `personalization' is virtually absent in Dichtbij (1%). U in de Wijk is
defined by a great share of `personalization' (26%), `good news' (25%) and `promotion'
(22%); of all projects, De Jaap has the greatest share of `emotion' (13%).
Figure 7 shows the diversity in the use of news values, in terms of the 10 individual
values as well as in terms of the two main categories of hard and soft news values. The
differences between the projects are relatively small in terms of the 10 news values vary-
ing between .47 and .54. With regard to the dichotomous hard/soft categories, diversity
varies between .71 and a perfect 1. Furthermore, these findings do not suggest that diver-
sity in news values is associated with professional control over content.
Discussion and conclusion
In this study, we investigated how the contents of five very different examples of partici-
patory journalism manifest themselves regarding objectivity and diversity, two criteria
traditionally associated with `quality journalism'(Costera Meijer, 2001). We furthermore
examined if these manifestations were linked to the degree to which professional jour-
nalists have control over the participatory content published in these projects.
To start with, our findings concur with those from previous studies on the content of
(hyper)local participatory journalism (Carpenter, 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Paulussen and
D'heer, 2013) in the sense that the tendency towards subjective reporting style, covering
soft news topics, reliance on personal experience and first-hand witnessing, and towards
the use of soft news values was particularly strong in the local projects that were inves-
tigated. At the same time, this means that existing content analyses of participatory jour-
nalism,scarceandwithahomogeneousfocuson(hyper)localforms,arenotrepresentative
of participatory journalism in its entirety, as this study demonstrates that contents vary in
terms of objectivity and diversity.
Borger et al. 17
Most importantly, this study demonstrates that a notion of professional control is a
meaningful concept when interpreting differences between participatory journalistic
environments regarding these core elements of what has traditionally been considered as
journalistic `quality'. It was found that reporting style is more subjective as professional
control over content is weaker and that topic diversity increases. Source diversity and
diversity in news values did not increase with a weakening of professional control, but
participants did place different emphases regarding source use and news values when
given room to manoeuvre; they were more likely to rely on personal experience or first-
hand witnessing and to select news based on soft news values. The findings, thus, sug-
gest that participants, at least partly, tend to move away from traditional journalistic
understandings of objectivity and diversity.
Professional control, however, does not suffice to account for all the differences found
between the projects, which suggests that other explanatory factors play a role as well.
One such factor might be medium type. In contrast to written texts, video needs actual
persons to tell a story. Thus, in U in de Wijk, in which only video items were produced,
official collective identities (`the government declared that', `the labour union declared
that') were not used as a source and individuals (officials and non-officials together)
made up 76.4per cent of all source use. Another explanatory factor could be that partici-
patory journalism comprises various journalistic subgenres: opinion journalism (De
Jaap, The Post Online), commercially oriented hyperlocal journalism (Dichtbij), civi-
cally oriented community journalism (U in de Wijk). Subjective language, typical for
opinion journalism, was frequent on both De Jaap and The Post Online; both projects
explicitly invited participants to submit opinion pieces. On Dichtbij, most items were
announcements by or promotions of local businesses, where authors explicitly included
their positive evaluations of commercial activities or organizations. This explains why
reliance on what we labelled as `personal views, experience or first-hand witnessing' by
the author was stronger here than in other projects (33%). U in de Wijk, funded by a
regional broadcaster and a housing corporation with the purpose of increasing social
cohesion in urban problem areas, featured a particularly large share of non-official indi-
viduals (43.6%). This type of source use corresponds with goals of `nurturing' a (physi-
cal) community by giving voice to `ordinary' people from neighbourhoods, typical for
community journalism (Robinson, 2014).
Although this content analysis does not allow for claims about participants' prac-
tices and their perceptions about participatory journalism, combining the results from
this study with the findings from our previous study in which participants were inter-
viewed about their expectations and evaluations of participating in journalism (Borger
et al., 2015), we suggest that the tendency away from traditional understandings of
objectivity and diversity reconfirms that participatory journalism is a space of `bound-
ary work' (Lewis, 2012; Wahl-Jorgensen, 2015) that encourages both rethinking and
reinforcing boundaries of conventional quality journalism. Rethinking is implied in the
tendency towards a more subjective reporting style, which suggests that participants
might consider transparency more valuable than neutrality (Deuze, 2005); the ten-
dency towards covering soft news topics, which suggests that participants see value in
covering topics beyond those that are traditionally associated with quality journalism
(economics, politics, foreign; Costera Meijer, 2001); the tendency towards soft news
18 Journalism 
values ­ and the marginal presence of negativity in participants' content especially ­
suggests that participants use different criteria for deciding what is `newsworthy'
(Costera Meijer, 2013). In our previous study (2014), we demonstrated that if partici-
pation takes place in hyperlocal contexts without any form of professional control,
participants may use the opportunity to publish for communicative purposes connected
to `marketing' rather than `journalism', labelling such activities as `not journalism'.
This acknowledgement indicates an intuitively clear line between what counts as jour-
nalism and what goes beyond, and reconfirms existing boundaries between journalism
and marketing, advertising or `PR'.
The projects studied in this article reflect the diversity among participatory initiatives
in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2014. As such, we consider the findings to be rep-
resentative of what has been developed under the header of participatory journalism in
the Netherlands during this period. Future research should examine if similar patterns
can be found in other countries, beyond the time span present in this study and outside
the context of professional journalistic frameworks.

Notes
1. Lemmatizing was executed using a part of speech (POS)-tagger in R ( Van den Eynde et al.,
2000).
2. Coders were Bachelor and Master students in Communication Science at VU University,
Amsterdam, 2015.
3. Diversity in entropy in number equivalents was calculated using the following formula:
diversity n
pi
i topic
n pi
( )=






=
 1
where pi is the proportion of the attention given to topic i.
The scores were transformed to a uniform scale between 0 and 1 using the following formula:
(diversity-1)/(number of categories-1)
4. Based on various seminal works on news values, Paulussen and D'heer (2013) compiled a list
of 21 news values (seeAppendix 3). We adapted this list as follows: We eliminated values that
overlapped with our interpretations of `central theme' (e.g. `political relevance' corresponded
with `politics', `economic relevance' with `economics', `cultural relevance' with `media' or
`arts and culture', `public relevance' with `social wellbeing', `reference to sex' with `per-
sonal relationships', `reference to animals' corresponded with `nature', `showbiz/TV' with
`media'). Next, we eliminated `picture opportunities', since we concentrated only on text.
Also, we added `celebrities' to `power/elite'. The resulting list of news values was tested dur-
ing a coding test on part of the sample. It was found that several news values were present
either in all items (consonance), or in none of the items (humour). These news values were,
therefore, excluded from further analysis. The same applies to `unambiguity' and `frequency'
that led to misunderstandings among the coders.
