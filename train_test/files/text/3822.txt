Abstract
`Leader' and `follower' are increasingly replacing `manager' and `worker' to become the routine
way to frame hierarchy within organizations; a practice that obfuscates, even denies, structural
antagonisms. Furthermore, given that many workers are indifferent to (and others despise) their
bosses, assuming workers are `followers' of organizational elites seems not only managerialist, but
blind to other forms of cultural identity. We feel that critical leadership studies should embrace
and include a plurality of perspectives on the relationship between workers and their bosses.
However, its impact as a critical project may be limited by the way it has generally adopted this
mainstream rhetoric of leader/follower. By not being `critical' enough about its own discursive
practices, critical leadership studies risk reproducing the very kind of leaderism it seeks to
condemn.

Introduction
The terms `leader' and `follower' are increasingly replacing expressions like `manager' and
`worker' and becoming routine ways to talk about hierarchical groups within organizations.
For example, what was once `management development' has frequently become `leadership
development'; `senior management teams' have often morphed into `senior leadership teams'
and CEOs typically present themselves, apparently unquestioningly, as their institution's
`leader' (and are generally described as such in the media). We have even come across the

term `middle-leader' in an advert for a school teacher. As Alvesson and Spicer (2014: 40;
italics in original) argue:
In many instances, embracing the idea of leadership does not involve any significant change to
practice but merely indicates an interest in relabeling managerial work as ``leadership'' to make it
sound more fashionable and impressive. The term leadership is seductive, has a strong rhetorical
appeal, and is therefore heavily overused.
However, this slippage between manager/leader and worker/follower is more than merely
rebranding with a more fashionable label. It relies on a logic of equivalence: on understand-
ing leadership as equivalent to a role or a kind of work. Because it relies on a logic of
equivalence, rather than a subtle interpenetration of meanings or gradual porousness in
the terms leader/manager and follower/worker, the shift to leadership represents a significant
shift in discursive terrain. Basic categories, fundamental to understanding work and the
employment relationship, are disappearing. In their place are labels that implicitly depict
a unitarist perspective of the labour process. The manager/worker dyad makes a power
imbalance explicit and includes the possibility that interests will diverge. Leader/follower
by contrast entails a common goal. It glosses fundamental questions about prerogative
because a worker can question managerial prerogative, but it does not quite make sense
for `followers' to question their leaders' basic authority in that way.
This shift to discourse about leaders could be attributed partly to a mushrooming literature
on leadership (Alvesson and Spicer, 2014; Grint, 2005; O'Reilly and Reed, 2010; Tourish,
2013). However, and paradoxically, calling someone a leader just because they inhabit a role,
or carry out a kind of work goes against the prevailing construction of leadership in the
literature. Contemporary leadership scholars tend to understand terms like leader and fol-
lower as referencing identities that are in some ways chosen and personal (which could be
consistent with the leader/manager slippage), but that are also enacted relationally (which is
not). According to most thinking about leadership, to be a leader is not merely to inhabit a
role, it is to identify as a leader, and for others to orient towards that identity or to sanction it
in some way (Grint, 2010). This is significant because at the same time as editing out terms
which potentially signal divergent interests (e.g. manager/worker), popular discourse on
leader/follower also airbrushes out any sense of consent or relationality. If a senior executive
is axiomatically a leader, those below are axiomatically followers ­ whether they like it or not.
We have been troubled by the practice of habitually calling people leaders and followers,
as if they were synonyms for manager and worker, ever since starting to notice it; not least
because of the experiences one of us (Mark) had while working as a manager in the UK
National Health Service (NHS) in the 1980s and `90s. But even to say NHS `manager' in the
context of the early 1980s NHS is not quite correct. When Mark first started in the NHS no
one officially had that title; everyone was an administrator. In 1983, however, after a gov-
ernment inquiry suggested that management should be introduced into the NHS there was
overwhelming enthusiasm for the change. Overwhelming enthusiasm, that is, amongst the
newly named managers (i.e. former administrators); but it came about only with strong
backing from the Thatcher government, in the teeth of opposition from clinicians (Strong
and Robinson, 1990). One thing that did unite the newly up-titled managers with the clin-
icians, however, was a shared intuition: that an apparently simple change in job title ­ from
administrator to manager ­ represented a shift in power dynamics (Bresnen et al., 2014;
Learmonth, 2005), one that would serve the interests of some (e.g. the new managers) over
others (e.g. the clinicians).
258 Leadership 13(3)
A generation on, we can see a comparable shift occurring across all sectors and industries.
Only now we are calling the managers leaders (Ford and Harding, 2007; Martin and
Learmonth, 2012; O'Reilly and Reed, 2011). The shift is occurring gradually and informally,
though even some 12 years ago Parker (2004: 175) had already detected that `management
itself [is] beginning to go out of fashion (being discursively articulated as something rather
like administration) and leadership [represents] the new panacea'.
Our aim in this paper is to demonstrate the problematic effects that accompany the routine
use of a leader/follower rhetoric ­ what one might call the language of leadership ­ especially
in the context of critical leadership studies (CLS) research. Our intent is not so much to
debate what leaders and followers are, but to show what the use of these terms does; par-
ticularly when deployed as apparently routine and more-or-less unnoticed generics for hier-
archical groups within organizations. What we call things sanctions certain forms of
discourse and knowledge, while disqualifying other possible ways of knowing and being in
the world. Yet for all its considerable merits in many other ways, much of CLS appears to
use the leader/follower dualism just like the mainstream ­ taking these terms as merely the
building blocks of analysis; in and of themselves necessary, natural and unproblematic.
Labels are never innocent though. Social scientists do not simply describe the world, we
also constitute it. Calling people leaders and followers potentially has a range of effects,
which might encourage us to be cautious in the use of these terms. As Alvesson and
Ka
¨ rreman (2016:142) argue, the terms leadership and followership are predominantly
used `to build and maintain a positive, celebrating, even glamorous view of organizational
relations [while] naturalizing and freezing (asymmetrical) social relations'.
The basic point, therefore, is that what we call people matters ­ and so reflexivity about
the effects of our naming practices is necessary. Unfortunately, when it comes to founda-
tional terms like leader and follower, such reflexivity appears to be largely absent in CLS.
Collinson (2011: 181) describes how CLS has `a concern to critique the power relations and
identity constructions through which leadership dynamics are reproduced'. We agree; but
argue that by routinely adopting the language of leadership, CLS risks being implicated in
the very power relations it sets out to critique.
In developing this argument, our article proceeds by providing critical readings of recent
leading work in CLS to show that:
(1) In spite of its claims to be distinctive from critical management studies (CMS), often
CLS is only definitively about leadership because of its preference for the terms leader
and follower. It seems as if more traditional terms like manager and worker have simply
been crossed-out by CLS researchers and replaced with leader and follower.
(2) Unfortunately, this preference for the language of leadership affects the tone of CLS work
­ naturalizing the interests of elites while de-radicalizing critique. Indeed, trying to be
critical while using the language of leadership can strike some very odd-sounding notes.
Critical Leadership Studies
Almost since the idea of organizational leadership was first introduced, leadership has had
its critics. A full review of literature critical of leadership in various ways is beyond the scope
of this article (for such a review see Tourish, 2013). However, exemplary work includes for us
landmark papers such as Meindl et al.'s (1985: 79) analysis of the romance of leadership,
Learmonth and Morrell 259
something which is: `hinted at in the observations made by a number of social and organ-
izational analysts who have noted the esteem, prestige, charisma, and heroism attached to
various conceptions and forms of leadership'. It also includes Smircich and Morgan's (1982:
258) critique of leadership as the management of meaning:
The leader exists as a formal leader only when he or she achieves a situation in which an obliga-
tion, expectation or right to frame experience is presumed, or offered and accepted by others. . . . It
involves a complicity or process of negotiation through which certain individuals, implicitly or
explicitly, surrender their power to define the nature of their nature of their experience to others.
Indeed leadership depends on the existence of individuals willing, as a result of inclination or
pressure, to surrender, at least in part, the powers to shape and define their own reality.
Since the 1980s, if not before, we have been able to see that what generally gets referred to as
leadership tends to be bound up with insidious forms of power asymmetries, overly roman-
ticized celebration, covert complicities and the surrender of agency. These features all signal
leadership as a problem in itself, something which is hardly the mainstream view. Such a
reading of leadership is rarely, if ever, explicit in the corporate courses that have proliferated
in recent years, nor in responses to remotely administered questionnaires that much main-
stream work in the field pursues. Indeed, it is only in the last few years that CLS has emerged
as a separately recognizable approach to studying and critiquing leadership.
The emergence of CLS is closely related to the growth of the more established tradition of
CMS. Briefly, CMS is a diverse set of ideas which, rather than being concerned primarily
with increasing organizational efficiency, seeks to reveal, challenge and overturn the power
relations within organizational life (King and Learmonth, 2015). This is a valuable under-
taking because, in contemporary industrial societies, it is through such structures that many
people are often constrained and dominated. CLS, as Collinson (2011: 182) argues, broadly
shares CMS's political aims and intellectual traditions, but it attempts to broaden CMS's
range, in that it:
Explicitly recognizes that, for good and/or ill, leaders and leadership dynamics (defined . . . as the
shifting, asymmetrical interrelations between leaders, followers and contexts) also exercise sig-
nificant power and influence over contemporary organizational and societal processes [whereas]
many CMS writers ignore the study of leadership, focusing more narrowly on management and
organization.
Fairhurst and Grant (2010: 188) support Collinson's reading of CMS's limits in relation to
leadership studies. For them also:
CMS scholars tend to be less enamored of leadership per se . . . If CMS scholars mention lead-
ership at all, they cast it as a mechanism of domination . . . view it with suspicion for being overly
reductionist . . . or proclaim a need for agnosticism.
Furthermore, many in CLS remain alive to the dangers of essentializing leadership as
something categorically distinct from management. As Collinson and Tourish (2015: 577)
argue:
[I]t makes sense to see management as somewhat more concerned with day-to-day operational
activities than leadership [nevertheless] the term leadership [as opposed to management] has
heuristic value in that it captures the approach, perceptions, and interactional dynamics of
varied organizational actors when they encounter uncertain environments, powerful others,
260 Leadership 13(3)
and complex strategic dilemmas, and in which the salience of leadership issues is therefore
heightened. However, attempts to establish absolutist distinctions between them [leadership
and management] can be viewed as another example of the ``dichotomizing tendency'' in lead-
ership studies.
Another feature of CLS, according to Collinson, is its emphasis on how `leadership dynam-
ics can emerge informally in more subordinated and dispersed relationships . . . as well as in
oppositional forms of organization such as trade unions . . . and revolutionary movements'
(2011: 182). The prominence attached to this feature of CLS certainly reflects a critical point
of view because rather than reproducing officially sanctioned corporate hierarchies it chal-
lenges and subverts them. Indeed, work like Zoller and Fairhurst's (2007: 1332) study of
resistance leadership ­ which highlights `the role of leadership in resisting and potentially
transforming structures of domination' provides an illustration of the critical potential in
such work. They provide extended examples of the leadership of dissent, focusing `on the
role of perceived unfairness and injustice as a key resource of dissent mobilization'
(2007: 1340). Take this excerpt, which uses the accounts of a participant ethnography by
Laurie Graham (1995) who worked in an American automobile factory. It was in this setting
that Graham:
[U]sed discourses around Japanese concepts of self-management and extant organizational
policy to fight the [recently introduced and unpopular] overtime requirement. However, her
refusal gains traction from other employees as it articulates simmering employee anger
around this issue. Before this incident, she [Graham] describes angry reactions when the team
leader asked employees to stay after shift to put away their tools because the line would no
longer stop five minutes early. Employees privately complained, saying things like `this is the
kind of bullshit that brings in a union', and `this place is getting too Japanese around here'. She
says, `From that day on, whenever the line ran up to quitting time, all of us on the team dropped
whatever we were doing and immediately walked out, leaving the team leader to lock up the
tools and clean the area' . . . That same month, after resentment grew about the mandatory
overtime, when the line kept moving after shift, `nearly everyone on the car side put on a
coat and walked out', although leaving a moving line is a cause for firing `and everybody
knew it'. (Zoller and Fairhurst, 2007: 1350)
According to Zoller and Fairhurst, activists and trade unionists ­ among other oppositional
groups ­ appropriate some of the influencing tools of leadership to advance causes that go
against the interests of elites. It is unsurprising then, that Zoller and Fairhurst (2007: 1354)
conclude by urging `more dialogue between leadership and critical researchers in order to
understand resistance leadership'.
We welcome all the above aspirations, and unlike authors such as Gemmill and
Oakley (1992), we are not arguing for a blanket ban on using the term leadership in
organizational scholarship. For us, the term can sometimes be a valuable category to
deploy, especially when used reflexively and judiciously to challenge and subvert its
received usage in mainstream research. After all, foundational critical thinkers like
Weber and Gramsci include discussions of leadership and its dynamics in their work.
What we are against, however, is the a priori use of leader and follower to represent
different hierarchical groups ­ as a kind of master category for representing and under-
standing social and organizational dynamics. As we show in the next section, this is
common practice in CLS ­ in spite of CLS's many other virtues ­something which
effectively sets CLS against some of its own aspirations.
Learmonth and Morrell 261
In order to explore the issues that arise, we now examine three prominent pieces of recent
CLS writing in more detail. We should emphasize that we regard all three of them as highly
successful ­ and critical ­ in many ways. However, all three share an important blind spot: an
apparently unreflexive use of leader and follower. The first is Harding (2014), a paper we use
to explore our claim that Critical Leadership Studies seems to be different from Critical
Management Studies only because of its preference to use leader and follower ­ and that
manager and worker would do just as well ­ at least in terms of semantics. The second is
Collinson (2014) ­ an article we juxtapose with some of Collinson's earlier work (from 1988)
­ to show both how new this drift from manager to leader is; and why it matters. Finally, we
examine the work of Collinson and Tourish (2015) to demonstrate the dangers of the uni-
versalization of leadership that an unreflexive use of leader and follower can imply ­ even in
an article that is otherwise highly successful in critiquing mainstream leadership studies.
Semantic swap: Crossing-out managers and workers
Let us turn first to Harding (2014). To demonstrate how synonymous leader and manager,
follower and worker are, at least in Harding's usage, below is the article's abstract in full.
Each reference to leadership/leader is replaced with management/manager; and each refer-
ence to follower is replaced with worker:
This paper develops a theory of the subjectivity of the leader manager through the philosophical
lens of Hegel's master/slave dialectic and its recent interpretation by the philosopher Judith
Butler. This is used to analyse the working life history of a man who rose from poverty to a
leadership management position in a large company and eventually to running his own successful
business. Hegel's dialectic is foundational to much Western thought, but in this paper, I rashly
update it by inserting a leader manager in between the master, whose approval the leader
manager needs if s/he is to sustain self-hood, and the follower worker, who becomes a tool
that the leader manager uses when trying to gain that elusive approval. The analysis follows
the structure of Butler's reading of the Dialectic and develops understanding of the norms that
govern how leaders managers should act and the persons they should be. Hard work has become
for leaders managers an ethical endeavour, but they grieve the sacrifice of leisure. They enjoy a
frisson of erotic pleasure at their power over others but feel guilt as a result. They must prove
their leadership management skills by ensuring their followers workers are perfect employees but
at the same time must prove their followers workers are poor workers who need their continued
leadership management. This leads to the conclusion that the leader manager is someone who is
both powerful and powerless. This analysis is intended not to demonize leaders managers, but to
show the harm that follows the emphasis on leadership management as a desirable and necessary
organizational function.
There is no loss in meaning or resolution with these changes ­ showing how manager and
worker here are direct synonyms for leader and follower. Also, the preference for leader/
follower has nothing to do with the paper's central problematic. Judith Butler's reading of
Hegel's master/slave would work with either leader/follower or manager/worker as the
dialectic.
That these terms are interchangeable would probably be true of many articles in
Leadership ­ especially those that focus on leadership as a positional and/or personal attri-
bute; but a reason for focusing on Harding's paper is that in the body of the text she
explicitly makes leader equivalent to manager. She also signals that the identity of the
leader/manager is intimately linked with capitalism: `it is on the body of ``the leader'',
262 Leadership 13(3)
``boss'' or ``manager'' that capitalism is inscribed, and it is through the leader/boss/manager
that capitalism speaks' (2014: 392). She also writes of `follower­bondsman­worker'
(Harding, 2014: 399) as synonyms. One is left to wonder, therefore, whether the article is
about leadership merely because it uses the terms leader and follower.
It clearly could have used manager and worker as its dominant terms; if it had done so
though, even with no other changes, Harding's work would presumably have been regarded
as a contribution to CMS. However, if manager had been its preferred term, the article
would doubtless not have been published in Leadership. Indeed, one factor fuelling the
growth in the language of leadership in organizational scholarship over the last few years
may well simply be the rise of journals like Leadership, which effectively require authors to
represent their work in the language of leadership (The Leadership Quarterly, published from
1990, was the first major journal of this type). Nevertheless, Harding's article is already being
commended as a model of writing in CLS (Collinson and Tourish, 2015; Tourish, 2015).
Drift over time: From shop-floor worker to follower, from
`the management' to leaders
As an illustration of why it matters whether we talk about leaders and followers or managers
and workers consider Table 1. It is a short extract from the recent writings of David
Collinson, juxtaposed with work he published some 26 years earlier.
The first thing that strikes us from this juxtaposition is just how radically Collinson has
chosen to re-present his earlier work in the language of the leader/follower. We say re-
present, because throughout the whole of the 1988 paper he used neither term (leader nor
follower) at all. What this change does, however, is markedly to alter the tone of the two
extracts. Whereas the 1988 piece has the feel of a radical critique of (the) management voiced
in the language of the shop-floor, the leader/follower dualism (though the word employee is
used once) gives the 2014 extract a rather more conciliatory, manager-orientated (or rather
we should say leader-orientated) tone. It is as if the 2014 version were addressed primarily to
and written for so-called leaders ­ leaders who seem to be equated, a priori, with elites. It is
still critical in the sense that it says uncomfortable things to those elites, i.e. that they can be
out of touch, unaware or unsympathetic. But all the Marxian-inflected rhetoric we find in the
1988 extract (e.g. `obscure conflict'; `hierarchical structure of status and power'; `the polar-
ization between management and shop-floor' etc.) seems to have disappeared ­ along with
the terms manager and shop-floor worker. To our ears, these changes have the effect of
significantly depoliticizing the 2014 account. They make the critique less challenging to the
powerful, with no sense of workers' voices coming through.
Our other main observation about the above table concerns the practice of calling people
like shop-floor workers followers. Follower seems so unlikely to be part of what Collinson
(1988: 185) himself calls the `cultural identities' of most ordinary workers across the world.
Can you imagine people like ```Fat Rat'', ``Bastard Jack'', ``Big Lemon'' and ``The Snake'''
(nicknames for some of the people Collinson (1988: 185) encountered during his shop-floor
ethnography) thinking of their identity via the term follower? Surely not! Take the opening
scene of the1960 British film Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (available at the time of
writing on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v¼zJAeb0wiQjA). The camera pans across a
busy factory before alighting on the protagonist, Arthur Seaton, played by Albert Finney,
at his workbench. Speaking directly to the camera, Arthur says of his bosses: `Don't let the
bastards grind you down!' Or what about Sergeant Milton Warden, played by Burt
Learmonth and Morrell 263
Lancaster, in the 1953 Hollywood film From Here to Eternity. Though the figure of the
military officer is often taken as the consummate, archetypal leader, Warden memorably
declares `I hate officers ­ I always hated officers!' and starts an affair with his own officer's
wife, perhaps in part to prove the point.
We can see that a case might perhaps be made for calling such people followers built on
notions like multiple subjectivities or identities. Still, why does anyone need to use it, espe-
cially as the routine term for people in lower hierarchical positions? To us, the thought of
people like Arthur Seaton or Sergeant Warden representing themselves as followers (of any
kind of organizational elite) is more than simply misleading ­ it is risible ­ indeed, insulting
to the many people today who share similarly dismissive views of the people in power over
them. How many academics would refer to themselves as `followers'? Yet many of us are
ready to label others with these terms, such that contemporary Arthur Seatons and Sergeant
Wardens are regularly being represented as followers in CLS research. Indeed, we find it
hard to see any organizational context where the term `follower' might be appropriate (cf.
Blom and Alvesson, 2015; Ford and Harding 2015). Its use seems as insulting and demean-
ing to workers as it is flattering to the managerial ego: a toxic combination!
Framing the field: Alternatives to leadership, leadership?
It is important to emphasize that CLS writers who nowadays prefer to talk about leaders and
followers leave no doubt that they propose a critical reading of organizational life. Indeed,
Collinson and Tourish (2015) have recently provided radical criticisms of mainstream
Table 1. From shop-floor worker to follower; from `the management' to leaders.
Collinson (2014: 44) Collinson (1988: 186/7)
My own research in organizations over the past
30 years has found a recurrent . . . pattern. This
is for organizational leaders to be either una-
ware of organizational tensions and paradoxes
or, if they are informed of them, to try to deny
or downplay their nature, extent, and conse-
quences. This is especially the case with regard
to leaders' relations with followers/employees.
Leaders' hierarchical position ``at the top'' of
organizations can result in them being distant
and detached from ``the front line'' where
many of the organization's tensions are often
most acutely experienced . . . Equally, followers
may face considerable difficulties and barriers
in seeking to voice their ``critical upward
communication'' to those in senior
positions . . . Consequently, leaders can be lar-
gely unaware of fundamental tensions and
contradictions embedded within routine
organizational practices.
Shop-floor humour directed at managers was
usually concerned to negate and distance
them . . . By contrast, management repeatedly
sought to engage shop stewards in humorous
interaction. Yet, the stewards were aware that
this managerial humour was intended to
obscure conflict behind personalized relations,
which tried to deny the hierarchical structure
of status and power . . . Six years earlier the
company had been taken over by an American
multi-national . . . As part of the American's
campaign to win the trust of the workforce, a
company in-house magazine was introduced.
The paper was dismissed widely as a `Let's be
pals act' and nicknamed . . . `Goebbel's
Gazette.'. . . The intention of managerial
humour [included in the Gazette], to reduce
conflict and emphasize organizational harmony,
had the opposite effect of merely reinforcing
the polarization between management and
shop-floor.
264 Leadership 13(3)
leadership research and teaching. They advance, `the idea that leadership is socially con-
structed and interpreted and that ``it'' could mean very different things to different actors in
different situations' (578). They also remind readers of `the twin perils of hype and hubris'
(580) in teaching students to be leaders, along with the need for `the teaching of leader-
ship . . . to go beyond a ``rotten apple'' theory of dysfunctionality and corruption to examine
the barrel within which the apples have soured' (586). While welcoming these sorts of state-
ments, we think the authors foreclose an even more radical critical analysis. Simply by the
ways in which they use the terms, they imply that leadership and followership are neutral,
natural and necessary categories of analysis. In other words, they fail to signal any reflexivity
about their representational practices.
This is important because many of their above critiques might be absorbed or otherwise
appropriated by the mainstream (see e.g. Dinh et al., 2014; Schyns and Schilling, 2013 for
mainstream work to have done so). However, the mainstream can deal much less readily
with the idea that its fundamental categories ­ leader and follower ­ may be interest serving
in themselves. Unfortunately, this possibility is not ­ as far as we can see ­ even raised by
Collinson and Tourish. Yet using the leader/follower dyad provides Collinson and Tourish
with numerous problems. For example, they are right to be troubled that those involved in
mainstream leadership research and teaching `tend to assume that the interests of leaders and
followers automatically coalesce, that leadership is an uncontested form of top-down influ-
ence, follower consent is its relatively unproblematic outcome and resistance is abnormal or
irrational' (2015: 577). However, they appear to overlook the possibility that at the root of
the problem may lie the very terms themselves: that leader and follower semantically entail
coalescence. Part of the general understanding of leadership in our culture includes some-
thing like `an uncontested form of top-down influence' just as, if someone is referred to as a
follower, s/he would generally be thought of as someone for whom `any resistance is abnor-
mal or irrational'.
Their own formulation, `follower dissent and resistance' (2015: 576) crystallizes the dis-
cursive problem they have set for themselves. In what sense can a person intelligibly remain a
follower while simultaneously displaying dissent and resistance? Someone who dissents and
resists is surely (according to received English meanings) not a follower. The reader is left to
resolve the contradiction within their formulation ­ presumably by concluding that at the
level of identity the person is a follower ­ and that their dissenting and resistant behaviours
must merely be temporary aberrations. Such a conclusion is the opposite of a critical stance
on the identities of workers because the leader/follower formulation implies that ultimately
both leader and follower share the same goal. To avoid this problem ­ which one could say
Collinson and Tourish have set for themselves ­ would be simple if they merely argued about
worker dissent and resistance!
By using this language of leadership, Collinson and Tourish also fall into the trap
Alvesson and Ka
¨ rreman (2016: 142) identify:
Many researchers find a market for work using the popular signifier ``leadership''
because . . . mainstream approaches have made leadership fashionable. Many efforts to develop
``alternative'' views thus at the same time partly break with and reinforce the domination of
``leadership'' . . . Nuances involved in the efforts to revise ``leadership'' are easily lost as the major
framing reinforces a dominating ``mega-discourse,'' weakening others. For example, this rein-
forces an understanding that the alternative to leadership is leadership, not peer relations, pro-
fessionalism, autonomy, co-workership, organizing processes, or mutual adjustment offering
alternative framings and understanding than what the leadership vocabulary invites.
Learmonth and Morrell 265
Collinson and Tourish's work reinforces an understanding that `the alternative to leadership
is leadership' by, for instance, encouraging students `to draw on their own experiences of
leadership and followership dynamics in schools, workplaces and families' (2015: 581). To
encourage such practices seems to be endorsing the use of the problematic discourse in new
areas ­ young people's relations with one another in schools and in families ­ where, as far as
we know, even the most enthusiastic of mainstream leadership commentators have yet to
venture (though see Harms and Spain (2016) for something close). In other words, Collinson
and Tourish end up encouraging students to see leadership and followership almost
everywhere.
Discussion
These critical readings of CLS's representational practices are reinforced when we observe that
the exponential growth in leadership's appeal since the 1980s has occurred during a period which
also witnessed the rise of neoliberalism and the consequent widespread defeat of trade union
power (Brown, 2015). Indeed, given the extent to which they share strikingly similar unitary and
individualizing impulses, the current popularity of the language of leadership might be read as a
direct analogue for today's neoliberal consensus. An a priori use of formulations like leader and
follower is as useful to those at the top of big business ­ and as congruent with their interests ­ as
other forms of neoliberal rhetoric; say, the redefinition of job insecurity as free agency or the
portrayal of billionaire tycoons as regular guys. When workers can be controlled through their
freedoms the defenders of capitalism no longer have to crush labour resistance. Redefining
themselves ­ the defenders of capitalism ­ as leaders (with workers now cast as followers) is
appealing as one potential avenue towards such control, not least because it tends to hollow out
classical notions of organizational politics, reducing debate about alienation and exploitation to
problem solving and team building (Lears, 2015).
In other words, the leader/follower dualism is hard to read as anything other than a denial
of the central tenet of Marxian-inflected organizations analyses ­ the structured antagonism
between capital and labour. The Communist Manifesto (Marx and Engels, 1848/1967: 79)
famously begins with a series of dualisms that emphasize class struggle and conflict: `The
history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave,
patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word oppressor and
oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another'. The leader/follower dualism does
not fit Marx and Engel's list of oppositions ­ both leader and follower stop being merely
nicer- or more fashionable-sounding synonyms for manager and worker in certain important
contexts. This is because the cultural valences associated with the language of leadership
imply neither struggle between leader and follower nor anything else that might be particu-
larly oppressive or oppositional. Rather, they suggest that the norm is friendly relations, and
that a person's (i.e. a so-called follower's) primary allegiance is (or should be) to her leader ­
not solidarity with other workers. In contrast, one of the classical terms in organizational
analysis ­ worker ­ is still, for many, within the trade union movement and beyond, emblem-
atic of class solidarity; it certainly seems unlikely to naturalize asymmetrical social relations
in the same way as follower might. Thus, traditional analytical dualisms like manager/
worker or capital/labour (as opposed to leader/follower) leave rhetorical space for solidarity
and radical resistance; whereas those starting to be constructed as followers might well
assume that they can legitimately offer no more than (what their so-called leaders would
see as) `constructive resistance' (Uhl-Bien et al., 2014: 93).
266 Leadership 13(3)
In sum, any `critical' work on leadership that uses leader and follower as a priori, uni-
versal categories will lack a certain potential for critique. This framing forecloses radical
resistance and is more easily assimilated with dominant albeit unexamined ideals in the
leadership literature. For instance, if we begin by thinking in terms of leader/follower, it
takes us closer to a pro-hegemonic ideal: that a core part of what leaders do is to frame
reality for their `followers'. It also lends independent authority to the pro-hegemonic ideal
that `followers' willingly surrender their powers to shape their own realities. So, rather than,
as Collinson and Tourish (2015: 577) believe, being `fundamentally about the effective or
ineffective exercise of power, authority, and influence' we suggest that the terms leadership
and followership are at root performative (Gond et al., 2015). By which we mean, in a
nutshell, that if someone is called a leader or a follower often enough the very act itself
tends to bring about what it says; typically to the bosses' benefit and to workers'
disadvantage.
Nevertheless, the language of leadership is undoubtedly an important phenomenon in
today's society. Indeed, the rhetoric is becoming so widespread in many organizational
contexts that as Morrell and Hewison (2013: 70) show `it becomes impossible to see an
alternative to ``leadership'' . . . leadership is, seemingly, anything and everything'.
Brocklehurst et al. (2010: 10) are therefore surely correct in claiming that `leadership is
both congruent with, and emblematic of, dominant contemporary understandings of what
is valuable in organizations'. As such, it needs critical analsis; and for this reason alone we
need CLS. But as many feminists, post-colonial and queer theorists (among others) have
argued (see for example Hughes, 2002; Seidman S., 1997; Smith 1999), it is very difficult,
perhaps often impossible, to construct radical critique in the language of the powerful.
We suggest, therefore, that CLS stops trying. Let us continually question the effects of the
language of leadership ­ and use alternatives ­ rather than routinely deploying it ourselves.
We have already cited some possible alternatives from Alvesson and Ka
¨ rreman (2016: 142):
`peer relations, professionalism, autonomy, co-workership, organizing processes, or mutual
adjustment'. We might also suggest that instead of follower terms like dissenter or radical
could be used. But to keep things simple, while the pairing is hardly entirely unproblematic
in itself, simply going back to the language of manager and worker seems to us to be one step
in the right direction.
Conclusion
Admittedly, to stop talking about leaders might be easier said than done. One of the reasons
for this difficulty is that the language of leadership is becoming so institutionalized. For
example, as the holder of the office of Deputy Dean at his Business School, one of us (Mark)
does not officially have an administrative job, nor even a management role; rather, according
to the university's designation he holds a `leadership position'. In these contexts it is espe-
cially difficult to oppose the language of leadership, not least because the practice is caught
up in a new kind of common sense; what Brown (2015) calls (in the title of her book) `neo-
liberalism's stealth revolution'. What is more, any opposition is made even harder when
many critical colleagues seem happy simply to go along with such changes.
One possibility, if we must talk about leadership in our scholarship, is to do so outside
conventional organizational contexts where consent and personal relationships are clearly
predominant. To focus, in other words, on those instances where leadership is developed
freely and collaboratively between people ­ and not on those circumstances when
Learmonth and Morrell 267
`leadership' is imposed ­ as is common in corporate settings. Alternatively, we might confine
our use of leadership to obviously subversive contexts. An example of the former approach is
provided by Humphreys et al.'s (2012) examination of leadership in jazz bands. In discussing
how musicians such as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Art Blakey and Winton Marsalis might
be thought of as `leaders' the authors move decisively away from any sort of corporate
setting and into an arena where leaders generally emerge with the consent and enthusiasm
of their musical peers. As they put it: `jazz [is] the focus of our research because equivocality
is central to its very essence' (2012: 42). Nevertheless, perhaps in part because the corporate
resonances of leadership are so strong, some of the reactions to their article from people
outside academia appear to assume that they were simply providing lessons for business
from jazz (Arnot, 2012). Dangers of similar misunderstandings, or even deliberate appro-
priation, mean that we prefer the second option, and try to use leadership in ways that are as
unambiguously subversive as possible. While misunderstanding or appropriation by elites
is always a lurking threat for any work that talks about leadership, with colleagues one of
us has, for example, explored leadership using queer theory (Ford et al., 2008; Harding
et al., 2011).
On a final note, earlier, we mentioned the classic movies Saturday Night, Sunday Morning
and From Here to Eternity because their characters contradict some of the assumptions
of the discourses of followership. Well, what about the 2010 British film (and subsequent
successful London West End musical) Made in Dagenham? For us, this movie subverts
the mainstream notions of both leader and follower in interesting ways ­ while also
linking notions of leadership with ideas about capitalism and patriarchy. The film is
based on historical events of worker resistance in Britain in the 1960s (see http://
www.traileraddict.com/made-in-dagenham/trailer), and like the other two films its central
character is a working-class hero; only this time she is a woman, Rita O'Grady, played by
Sally Hawkins.
Rita takes the initiative amongst her female colleagues to encourage them to stand up
against an oppressive Dagenham Ford factory management who refuse to pay fair wages to
women. On behalf of the other women, Rita subsequently finds herself taking on a male-
dominated trade union movement ambivalent about equal pay for women, and eventually,
the UK government's Employment Secretary, Barbara Castle. Rita and her colleagues ultim-
ately win their dispute, and in the process are instrumental in bringing about a change in the
law: the Equal Pay Act of 1970. Rita can be understood, in other words, as a superb
exemplar of Zoller and Fairhurst's (2007) resistance leadership. Indeed, in the film, Rita's
local shop steward calls her a leader `who inspires the other girls'. It seems likely that no
shop steward (or anyone else) would have called Rita a leader back in the 1960s. This
particular line is probably a reflection of the preoccupations and cultural scripts of the
early 21st century when the screenplay was written (although men referring to adult
women as `girls' is no doubt, rather more characteristic of the 1960s). Nevertheless, if
Rita can usefully be thought of as a leader then she was only a leader because of the explicit
and enthusiastic consent and support of her colleagues. As opposed to a leader in a corpor-
ate setting, Rita was not a boss in any sense. She certainly never got more pay than the
others, nor got any sort of other reward. In fact, she took on her responsibilities with great
reluctance and paid a high price for doing so in terms of the pressure they brought to bear on
her family and personal life.
However, no one would ever have called Rita a follower, surely ­ please, no! Just as
Arthur Seaton and Sergeant Warden did, she clearly despised those, like Mr Clarke (one of
268 Leadership 13(3)
the Ford bosses) who were supposed to be in charge of her. In fact, the following words are
included in the trailer to the movie: `I call Mr Clarke a complete cock!'
