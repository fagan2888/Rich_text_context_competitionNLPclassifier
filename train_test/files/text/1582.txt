Cysticercosis has emerged as a cause of severe neu-
rologic disease in the United States. We evaluated cysticer-
cosis-related deaths in the United States for 1990­2002 by
race, sex, age, state of residence, country of birth, and year
of death. A total of 221 cysticercosis deaths were identified.
Mortality rates were highest for Latinos (adjusted rate ratio
[ARR] 94.5, relative to whites) and men (ARR = 1.8). The
mean age at death was 40.5 years (range 2­88). Most
patients (187 [84.6%]) were foreign born, and 137 (62%)
had emigrated from Mexico. The 33 US-born persons who
died of cysticercosis represented 15% of all cysticercosis-
related deaths. The cysticercosis mortality rate was highest
in California, which accounted for 60% of all deaths.
Although uncommon, cysticercosis is a cause of premature
death in the United States. Fatal cysticercosis affected
mainly immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American
countries; however, US-born persons were also affected.
Cysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larval
form of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, has been
increasingly recognized as a cause of severe but preventa-
ble neurologic disease in the United States (1­5). Reports
documenting hundreds of cases, mainly of neurocysticer-
cosis, have drawn attention to this previously underrecog-
nized disease (6,7).
Cysticercosis has a complex life cycle. The larval
infection, cysticercosis, is transmitted through the fecal-
oral route. Eggs from the adult tapeworm T. solium, which
are directly infectious, are shed in the feces of a human
tapeworm carrier and subsequently ingested by pigs, the
usual intermediate host (8). The oncosphere embryos
emerge from the eggs, penetrate the intestinal wall, and are
disseminated by the bloodstream to various tissues where
the larval stage, or cysticercus, develops. The cycle is
completed when humans, the only naturally infected defin-
itive host, consume raw or undercooked pork containing
cysticerci, which attach to the small bowel and develop
into the adult tapeworm. However, humans may also
become infected with the larval stage when eggs are
ingested, typically in contaminated food or water.
Neurocysticercosis, the most severe form of the disease,
occurs when larvae invade tissue of the central nervous
system.
Cysticercosis in the United States affects mainly
immigrants from Latin America, where the disease is
endemic. However, cysticercosis acquired in the United
States has been repeatedly documented over the past 15
years, and travel-related infection in US-born persons has
been reported (9­11). Given the ongoing sizeable immi-
gration from disease-endemic areas, cysticercosis will
grow in clinical and public health importance; however,
data on cysticercosis in the United States are lacking. The
disease is not nationally reportable, few local jurisdictions
require reporting, and surveillance systems for cysticerco-
sis have rarely been implemented (10,12). In the absence
of effective surveillance, the true prevalence of cysticerco-
sis in the United States is largely unknown. Although sev-
eral hospital-based series have provided valuable insights
into the occurrence of cysticercosis, they reflect only a
portion of actual cases and do not measure the true effect
of the disease on the general population and at-risk popu-
lations. Moreover, few data exist on cysticercosis as a
cause of death in the United States (6,13). To augment cur-
rent information on the effect of cysticercosis in the United
States, we evaluated national mortality records for cys-
ticercosis-related deaths for the 13-year period 1990­2002.
Methods
Data Source
Mortality data were obtained from the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS). Death certificates, which are
required by state law, must indicate a cause or sequence of

events that led to death, as determined by the attending
physician. If a physician is not in attendance or the death
is accidental or occurs under suspicious circumstances,
then cause of death is determined by the local coroner or
medical examiner. Death certificate data are transmitted
from state jurisdictions to NCHS. The US Multiple Cause
of Death Files for 1990 through 2002 were searched for
listings of cysticercosis (ICD-9 code 123.1 for 1989­1998
and ICD-10 code B69 for 1999­2002). Availability of this
national data source typically has a 3-year lag time. The
multiple cause of death data contain all causes of death
provided by the physician or coroner. Such information is
more complete than data files with primary cause of death
only. Additional variables extracted from the death record
included age, sex, race/ethnicity, level of education, coun-
try of birth, place of death, date of death, and other concur-
rent conditions.
Data Analysis
Cysticercosis mortality rates per million population
were calculated. Population data were obtained from the
US Census Bureau. Crude cysticercosis mortality rates and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by age
group (<1, 1­4, 5­14, 15­24, 25­34, 35­44, 45­54,
55­64, 65­74, 75­84, >85 years), sex, race/ethnicity
(white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American), and state
of residence. Age-adjusted rates were calculated for
race/ethnicity, sex, and state. The US population for the
year 2000 was used as the standard population for all age-
adjusted rates. Rate ratios, adjusted rate ratios, and 95%
CIs were also computed. Demographic characteristics of
US-born patients were compared with those of foreign-
born patients. The 2, Fisher exact, and Student t tests were
used where appropriate to assess apparent differences.
Conditions occurring with cysticercosis were examined
and compared with a random sample of deaths from caus-
es other than cysticercosis matched by patient age, sex, and
race/ethnicity. Matched odds ratios and 95% CIs were cal-
culated for each condition.
Results
Over the 13-year study period, 221 cysticercosis
deaths were identified, representing an annual age-adjust-
ed mortality rate of 0.06 per million population (95% CI,
0.05­0.07). Most persons who died from cysticercosis
(187 [84.6%]) were Latino; 15 (6.8%) were white, 13
(5.9%) were black, 5 (2.3%) were Asian, and 1 (0.5%) was
Native American (Table 1). By sex, 137 (62.0%) were
male, and 84 (38.0%) were female. Mean age at death was
40.5 years (range 2­88 years). Most persons who died (187
[84.6%]) were foreign born, and 137 (62%) of all persons
who died had emigrated from Mexico. Ten (77%) of the
black and all 5 of the Asian persons who died were foreign
born. At least 1 cysticercosis death was reported from 20
states; California accounted for 57% (126 deaths), and Los
Angeles County, California, recorded 32% (70 deaths) of
the US total (Figure). Cysticercosis was listed as the pri-
mary cause of death for 165 (74.7%) persons.
Age-adjusted cysticercosis mortality rates were high-
est for Latinos (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] = 94.5, 95% CI
56.9­156.9, relative to whites) and men (ARR = 1.8, 95%
CI 1.4­2.3) (Table 2). The mean age at death was 40.5
years; >60% of deaths occurred in persons <45 years of
age. Most persons (61%) had <12 years of education.
Although no clear temporal trend was noted, cysticercosis
deaths varied by year; most deaths (23) occurred in 1992
and 1997.
The 33 cysticercosis deaths in US-born persons repre-
sented 15% of all cysticercosis deaths. Ten (30.3%) of
these 33 persons were California residents. US-born per-
sons with fatal cysticercosis had higher educational levels
(p = 0.02) and were older (mean age 50.1 vs. 38.7 years,
p<0.01) than foreign-born persons with fatal cysticercosis
(Table 3). Although 52% of US-born persons who died
were Latino, this proportion was lower than that for for-
eign-born persons (90.4%, p<0.01). At least 1 death of a

US-born person was reported in each year of the study
period.
Principal concurrent conditions listed as contributing
to death included hydrocephalus in 58 (26.2%) persons,
cerebral edema in 23 (10.4%), cerebral compression in 16
(7.2%), and epilepsy/convulsions in 12 (5.4%). These con-
ditions were significantly more common in persons who
died of cysticercosis than in matched controls (p<0.001).
Septicemia was recorded for 15 (6.8%) of persons with
fatal cysticercosis, but this figure was not significant.
Reported place of death included inpatient facility
(64.7%), emergency room or outpatient clinic (9.5%),
nursing home (9.5%), and residence (11.3%).
Discussion
Our findings indicate that in the United States, cys-
ticercosis is a cause of premature death, particularly
among young Latinos, and may be a more frequent cause
of death than previously recognized. Substantially more
deaths occurred in California, particularly Los Angeles
County, and in southwestern states bordering Mexico.
Although cysticercosis causes death mainly among
Hispanic immigrants, our findings indicate that this larval
tapeworm causes infection and death in US-born persons
as well.
The elevated cysticercosis mortality rates for Latinos
reflect the substantial immigration from T.
solium­endemic areas of Mexico and other Latin
American countries. Over 70% of cysticercosis deaths
were of persons born in Mexico. Legal immigration to the
United States from Mexico during 1991­2000 was >2.2
million; >1 million additional immigrants came from
Central and South American countries (14). Moreover,
undocumented immigration from such areas continues to
occur in considerable numbers. The US Immigration and
Naturalization Service estimates that 7 million unautho-
rized immigrants (4.8 million of these from Mexico) were
residing in the United States in January 2000 and that an
average of 350,000 immigrate each year (14).
Cysticercosis and taeniasis are widely prevalent in many
Latin American countries. Autopsy studies conducted in
Mexico have reported cysticercosis prevalence from
2.8% to 3.6%, and serosurveys have demonstrated infec-
tion rates of >20% in some areas of Peru, Guatemala, and
Bolivia (3,15). A recent study of farm workers in southern
California documented seroprevalence of 1.8% for cys-
ticercosis and 1.1% for taeniasis, comparable to that in
cysticercosis-endemic areas (16).
We noted several cysticercosis deaths of persons who
were born in the United States, which indicates the possi-
bility of locally acquired disease. Transmission of cysticer-
cosis in the United States has been repeatedly documented
over the past 20 years and can often be traced to the pres-
ence of a tapeworm carrier among household members or
other close personal contacts (3,9­11,17). An outbreak of
neurocysticercosis in an Orthodox Jewish community in
New York City implicated domestic employees from Latin

America who harbored Taenia infections as the probable
source of infection (9). A pilot surveillance system imple-
mented in Los Angeles County during 1988­1990 identi-
fied 10 locally acquired cases among 138 cases reported
and found a tapeworm carrier among household contacts
for 5 (7%) of 72 overall cases investigated (10).
Alternatively, the occurrence of cysticercosis among
US-born persons may reflect travel-related exposure and
infection. Travel-associated cysticercosis, mainly in per-
sons who have visited Mexico and other Latin American
countries, has been previously documented; however the
risk and frequency of such infections are unknown (10,18).
The Los Angeles County surveillance system identified 9
probable travel-related cases, which represented 6.5% of
the total cysticercosis cases. In a study of cysticercosis in
Texas, de La Garza and colleagues reported 6 cases in US-
born persons, all of whom had a history of frequent travel
to rural Mexico or Central America (19). Substantial num-
bers of US residents travel to cysticercosis-endemic areas
each year and may be exposed to food and water contami-
nated with T. solium eggs. Therefore, many of the US-born
persons likely acquired infection during travel to endemic
areas. Food and water precautions for travelers to cysticer-
cosis-endemic regions should be reinforced.
Although 21 states had at least 1 death from cysticer-
cosis, mortality rates were highest in California and other
border states. Cysticercosis deaths were also routinely
recorded in New York and Florida. This observed geo-
graphic focus of cysticercosis deaths reflects immigration
patterns in states that include substantial populations of
immigrants from cysticercosis-endemic areas, particularly
Mexico and other areas of Latin America.
The sex disparity noted in this study is consistent with
data from our recent population study, which demonstrat-
ed a significantly higher prevalence of cysticercosis in men
(16) and likely reflects the greater immigration of young
men in search of employment. Such immigration patterns
may also explain the relatively young age observed; >60%
of cysticercosis deaths in our study were in persons <45
years of age, a heavy toll among young, highly productive
persons.
Although we could not assess whether problems with
access to healthcare contributed to cysticercosis deaths,
>20% of deaths occurred at home, in an emergency room,
or in an outpatient setting. Reduced access may have an
effect on cysticercosis deaths; additional data on this issue
would be useful.
Several large facility-based case series studies have
reported that the number of deaths from cysticercosis is
relatively low and that the case-fatality rate is <1%.
However, such facility-based studies, although providing
valuable information, have substantial limitations and may
underestimate cysticercosis as a cause of death. Limited
data from the pilot Los Angles County surveillance system
found a mortality rate of 6% (8 of 138 incident cases),
and the Dixon study of British troops who had served in
India reported mortality rates of nearly 10% (10,20).
However, these case-fatality rates must be viewed with
caution because they may reflect underdiagnosis or under-
reporting of less severe cases and therefore probably rep-
resent overestimates. Mortality rates have been reported to
be higher for surgically treated patients and those with
hydrocephalus, primarily because of increased intracranial
pressure and shunt-related infection (21). We found that
hydrocephalus, cerebral compression/edema, and epilep-
sy/convulsions were common concurrent conditions
recorded on the death certificate. Fatal cysticercosis may
also occur in persons who have ingested large numbers of
eggs, which may cause an overwhelming, fatal acute infec-
tion with numerous larvae and severe central nervous sys-
tem pathologic changes. Racemose cysticercosis, a
phenomenon in which cysticerci continue to grow and pro-
liferate through tissue, may also have a poor prognosis.
Newer, less invasive, endoscopic surgical techniques for
removing intraventricular cysticerci offer promise of
reducing mortality rates (22).
Our data, although population based, likely underesti-
mate cysticercosis deaths for several reasons. To be listed
on the death certificate, cysticercosis must be recognized
and diagnosed, which requires confirmation of infection
through biopsy, autopsy, or specialized serologic testing
(23). Consequently, some cases of fatal cysticercosis like-
ly go undiagnosed and unrecognized, which would result
in the miscoding of cysticercosis-related deaths as other
conditions. For this reason, death records may be biased
and likely underestimate deaths from cysticercosis. The
absence of fatal cases reported from Kansas, despite a

recent report documenting widespread cysticercosis (24),
appears to support the notion of underrecognition of fatal
cases and suggests caution in interpreting geographic dis-
tribution. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of using
multiple-cause-of-death data instead of the traditional
underlying-cause-of-death data alone for estimating deaths
from cysticercosis. An additional 56 (25.3%) cases were
identified by using multiple-cause­coded files.
The use of death certificates to assess the effect of dis-
ease has advantages and limitations. Because submission
of death certificates is required by state law, ascertainment
and registration of deaths are virtually complete. Use of
mortality records therefore provides population-based data
and avoids the potential biases of facility-based data or
other data that are not population based. Mortality data can
also indicate disease severity and contribute to measures of
disease load. However, data from death certificates have
several limitations, including the possible coding of inac-
curate information through careless completion of cause of
death, coding errors, and misclassification of variables
such as race/ethnicity (25,26). Reporting of country of
birth may also be inaccurate, and persons with cysticerco-
sis who are recorded as having been born in the United
States may, in fact, be foreign born. Deaths from cysticer-
cosis represent only a small fraction of total disease bur-
den. In addition, census data and intercensus population
estimates used for the calculation of rates may be uncer-
tain. For these reasons, our estimate of cysticercosis mor-
tality rate must be interpreted with caution.
Cysticercosis can cause severe neurologic disease and
death and result in substantial cost to the healthcare sys-
tem, yet simple public health measures can reduce or elim-
inate this parasitic disease. In fact, cysticercosis has been
identified as 1 of 6 potentially eradicable diseases (27).
Because most cysticercosis cases in the United States are
imported, efforts to control the disease in cysticercosis-
endemic regions will reduce disease in the United States.
Such control activities can also reduce the likelihood of
travel-related infection. State and local health authorities
in affected areas of the United States should consider
implementing surveillance and follow-up of cysticercosis
patients, including attempts to identify and treat tapeworm
carriers among household members and other close per-
sonal contacts. The availability of a sensitive and specific
test for T. solium infection that can be performed from
blood samples obtained through simple finger stick will
facilitate such follow-up (28). Given the importance of
cysticercosis in border areas, collaborative studies with
Mexican public health authorities on the prevalence and
incidence of cysticercosis in the border regions should be
implemented (29,30).
