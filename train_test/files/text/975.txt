OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between diet, particularly dietary fat intake, and body mass index (BMI).
DESIGN: Prospective study of adults who participated in the 1989 and 1991 China Health and Nutrition Survey.
SUBJECTS: 3484 adults aged 20±45 at baseline (1989) survey.
MEASUREMENTS: Measurement of dietary intake with replicated 24 h dietary recalls. Anthropometric measurements.
Measurements of physical activity, smoking habit and socio-economic factors.
RESULTS: Change in fat intake was positively associated with change in BMI in men (b
b  0.00036, P  0.0001), and
change in physical activity level was inversely associated with change in BMI in women (b
b  70.12, P  0.02). Energy
intake, physical activity and major socio-economic factors were related to BMI in cross-sectional analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet is becoming an increasingly important determinant of body weight in this population, where fat
and energy consumption has been increasing steadily during the past decade.

Introduction
Experiments in laboratory animals have repeatedly
shownthatthereisastrongpositiverelationshipbetween
dietary fat intake and body weight.1,2 This is generally
attributed to the more ef®cient metabolism of fat com-
paredtoothernutrients2,3andtothehyperphagiceffectof
a high-fat diet.4 In humans, dietary fat is also stored as
body fat more ef®ciently than other macronutrients.5,6
Usinglaboratorytechniquestodeterminebodycomposi-
tion and energy expenditure, the body fat mass was
positively correlated with intakes of total fat, saturated
and monounsaturated fatty acids.7 Because body fat did
not correlate with total energy intake in this study, it was
concluded that fat intake, independent of energy intake,
may be associated with body fatness.7 Thus, at a given
level of energy intake, speci®c sources of energy in the
diet may differentially affect weight gain.8
In contrast to animal experiments and clinical studies,
the epidemiologic studies of diet and body weight have
shown mixed results, ranging from a positive to an
inverse relationship.8±13 Cross-sectional studies are
generally in agreement that dietary fat is positively
associated with relative weight, whereas the prospective
studies of diet in relation to weight change give incon-
sistent results.14 The reasons for this inconsistency are
not clear. However, given the complexity of body
weight regulation, these inconsistent ®ndings may be
caused by a host ofknownandunknown factors,ranging
from genetic and metabolic factors to the behavioral
factors such as dieting in response to weight gain.14
Furthermore, epidemiologic studies of diet and body
weight are complicated by the dif®culty in measuring
dietary intake of a free-living population, resulting in
measurement errors in dietary data. These errors may be
caused, for example, by the under-reporting of intake by
some overweight individuals9 and by the daily variation
in food intake of the same individual.15
Despite these dif®culties, there are longitudinal stu-
dies that have shown a positive relationship between
dietary fat and body weight or change in body
weight.8,12 For instance, animal fat intake was found
to be positively associated with weight gain in a cohort
of healthy women.8 These studies are consistent with the
animal experiments and clinical studies, and with the
ecological studies of diet and body weight that used data
compiled from different populations, especially those of
the developing countries.16
In this study, we examined the relationship between
diet and body mass index (BMI), taking into account
physical activity, smoking habit and major socio-
economic factors. Data for analysis came from the ®rst
and second China Health and Nutrition Survey con-
ducted in 1989 and 1991, respectively. Both the cross-
sectional and the longitudinal analyses were performed.
Dietary data were obtained from the repeated measure-
ments of diet using consecutive 24 h dietary recalls.

demographic, dietary and health data from eight
provinces in China. The details of the survey design
and survey data are given elsewhere.17 The represen-
tative sample was drawn by multistage, random clus-
ter sampling from each province. The ®nal sample
consisted of 3780 households. These households have
been followed every two years since 1989.
All eligible adults aged 20±45 y were included in
this study. Of the 4675 adults with complete data in
1989, 3484 individuals (74.5%) from 2050 households
also provided complete data in 1991. Earlier analysis
suggested that the non-participating households (for
example, those which could not be contacted) were
random and did not represent a selective group. Our
analysis showed that the BMI, dietary intakes and
major socio-economic factors of individuals who were
lost to follow-up did not differ signi®cantly from
those who remained in the study. For example, the
mean BMI and fat intake at baseline of those who
were lost to follow-up were 21.4 kgam2 and 544
calories compared to 21.5 kgam2 and 545 calories,
respectively, of those who remained in the study
(t-test, P b 0.1). All women who were pregnant or
lactating at the time of either survey (n  292) were
excluded from analyses.
Dietary data
Dietary data were obtained from the 24 h dietary recall
taken daily for three consecutive days. Each subject
was asked to report all foods consumed during the
previous 24 h, in Chinese measurement units. Detailed
questioning was used when appropriate. More than
95% of the subjects had completed all of the three
recalls. From these data, the intakes of energy, fat and
other nutrients on each day were calculated using the
of®cial 1991 Chinese Food Composition Table.
Dietary data used in this paper represent the average
(mean) of these replicate dietary recalls. Collection of
dietary data was carried out by trained nutritionists,
with speci®c training provided at the beginning of
each survey.
Anthropometric data
Anthropometric measurements were carried out by
trained health workers. Body weight was measured
in light indoor clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg with a
beam balance scale. Height was measured without
shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm, using a portable stadi-
ometer. Speci®c training on anthropometric assess-
ment was provided at the beginning of each survey.
From weight and height data, the BMI (weight in
kgaheight in m2) was calculated.
Physical activity data
Physical activity data were collected from the reported
physical activity level at occupation, ranging from 1
(very sedentary) to 5 (very strenuous). These were
later classi®ed into three categories (sedentary, mod-
erate and strenuous). The data on leisure or sport
activity were not available. However, it was assumed
that the reported physical activity was an adequate
proxy measure of energy expenditure in this sample of
working adults.
Other biological data
Collection of age data in China is dif®cult because the
Western and the Chinese calendars are often used
interchangeably. In this survey, all dates of birth were
placed into the Western calendar, which may differ by
as much as 1 1
2
months from the traditional Chinese
date.
Basic data concerning smoking habits were avail-
able from the 1989 survey, but more detailed data
were collected in the 1991 survey. These included the
present smoking habit, the age when smoking started
or stopped, and the type and amount of tobacco used
per day. Because the amount of tobacco consumption
was not reported in 1989, the subjects were classi®ed
into two categories: smoker and non-smoker or ex-
smoker.
Pregnancy and lactation status in women was
recorded at both the 1989 and the 1991 surveys.
Socio-economic data
Data about income, occupation, education and place
of residence were relevant to this analysis. Questions
about income were designed to cover all of the
income-generating activities, including the non-mone-
tary government bene®ts such as food subsidies and
ration coupons. In addition, the possession of major
household assets (for example, major electrical appli-
ances, farming equipment and livestock) was
recorded.
The primary occupations were classi®ed into three
categories: (1) Farmers, agricultural workers and
unskilled workers; (2) Semi-skilled and skilled work-
ers and (3) Professional, administrative and manage-
rial workers.
The education levels were classi®ed into four
categories based on the year(s) of formal education
completed: (1) None, (2) Primary school, (3) Middle
school and (4) Upper-middle, high school or college.
Place of residence was included in this analysis
because signi®cant differences in BMI and dietary
intakes between urban and rural residents in China
have been clearly demonstrated.17±19
Statistical analysis
Population characteristics at baseline (1989) were
examined in the descriptive analysis. Because both
BMI and dietary intake tend to vary with age, analysis
of covariance was used to compare the mean BMI and
dietary intakes of the study sample strati®ed by major

characteristics, simultaneously controlling for possi-
ble difference in the age structures of groups that were
being compared.
The changes in diet, physical activity and BMI
during the 1989±1991 period were examined in the
study sample strati®ed by gender and place of resi-
dence. In addition, the changes in BMI of individuals
who reported an increase in fat intakes, individuals
who reported a decrease in physical activity and
individuals who reported both an increase in fat
intake and a decrease in physical activity were com-
pared to their respective counterparts. This approach
has been used to evaluate the body fatness in people
who maintained contrasting lifestyles.20
In the subsequent multivariable analyses, the nutri-
ent partition method, whereby total dietary intake is
partitioned into intake of energy from fat and intake of
energy from sources other than fat, was used to
examine the effect of fat intake on BMI taking into
account the effect of total energy intake.21 Unless
where noted, these dietary intakes are referred to as
`fat intake' and `energy intake' throughout this paper.
Because the sampling units in this survey were
households rather than independently selected
individuals, the variance of BMI may be increased
regardless of whether these households were ran-
domly or non-randomly selected.22 We have exam-
ined this so-called `cluster' effect and found it to be
negligible in this sample. This was probably due to the
small household (cluster) size. The average household
size was 1.7 people.
Multiple regression analysis was used to examine
the cross-sectional relationship between diet and BMI
at baseline (1989) survey, controlling for other biolo-
gical and socio-economic factors. Analysis was initi-
ally done using the total sample and then separately
for men and women.
Longitudinal analysis of the diet-BMI relationship
was made by using the ®xed effects model that is
suitable for analysis of longitudinal time-series data.23
This statistical model focuses on the change in the
dependent variable (BMI) in relation to the changes in
explanatory variables (such as diet and physical activ-
ity) over time. The effects of variables that do not vary
over time (for example, gender) were tested by
including these variables as interaction terms with
all other variables in the model.
All analyses were done with Stata release 4.023 and
SAS version 6.08.24

sedentary physical activity and non-smokers, had
higher mean BMI than their respective counterparts.
Dietary intakes in the study population also varied
across the levels of biological and socio-economic
factors. For example, men, smokers, rural residents,
persons who reported strenuous physical activity and
persons with low income had higher total energy
intake than their respective counterparts. In contrast,
urban residence, high education level, high income
and sedentary activity or occupation were associated
with high fat and protein intakes.
The changes in BMI, dietary intakes and physical
activity during the 1989±1991 period, strati®ed by
gender and place of residence, are presented in Table
2. There were increases in BMI that were similar
across the population subgroups. The total energy
intake decreased in all subgroups, especially among
men and rural residents. However, the percentage of
total energy intake as fat was increased, especially
among the urban residents. A greater percentage of
urban residents reported sedentary physical activity
and a greater percentage of rural residents reported
strenuous physical activity in 1991 compared to 1989.
On closer examination, 53% of the study population
reported an increase in fat intake and 47% reported a
decrease in fat intake in 1991 compared to 1989. The
mean change in BMI of those who increased their fat
intake was 0.24 kgam2, compared to 0.11 kgam2 of
those who decreased their fat intake. The difference
was statistically signi®cant (P ` 0.05).
Of the study population, 85% reported no change or
an increase in physical activity and 15% reported a
decrease in physical activity. The mean change in BMI
of those who maintained or increased their physical
activity was 0.16 kgam2, compared to 0.26 kgam2 of
those who decreased their physical activity. However,
the difference was not statistically signi®cant.
The mean change in BMI of individuals who
decreased their fat intake and maintained or increased
their physical activity (n  1427) was 0.11 kgam2,
compared to 0.34 kgam2 of those who reported an
increase in their fat intake and a decrease in their
physical activity (n  312). The difference was statis-
tically signi®cant (P ` 0.05).

Diet, activity and BMI of Chinese adults
S Paeratakul et al
427
Cross-sectional analysis of diet-BMI relationship at
baseline (Table 3) showed that diet, physical activity
and several socio-economic factors were signi®cantly
associated with body mass. Both fat and energy
intakes were positively associated with BMI in the
total sample and in men. In women, both dietary
intakes were positively associated with BMI, but the
effect of fat intake was not statistically signi®cant. Of
all other predictors of body mass examined, age,
urban residence and possession of major household
assets were positively related to BMI. Education level
was negatively related to BMI in women and marital
status was positively related to BMI in men. Physical
activity was inversely associated with BMI in the total
sample and in both genders.
In the longitudinal analysis, the multiple regression
models of diet and BMI showed that both fat and energy
intakes at baseline (1989) were positively associated
with attained BMI in 1991, while physical activity at
baseline was negatively associated with attained BMI.
Similarly, dietary intakes and physical activity at base-
line were associated with the change in BMI during the
1989±91 period. However, the associations between
dietary intakes at baseline and the subsequent change
in BMI were not statistically signi®cant.
In the longitudinal analysis using the ®xed effects
model, change in fat intake was positively associated
with the change in BMI for the total sample (Table 4).
Change in physical activity level was negatively
associated with a change in BMI, that is, an increase
(decrease) in physical activity was associated with a
decrease (increase) in BMI. Increasing age was asso-
ciated with an increase in BMI. The fat intake-gender
interaction term indicated that the fat intake-BMI
relationship was not signi®cant in women. Changes
in smoking habit and all of the socio-economic vari-
ables examined were not related to a change in BMI.
Gender-speci®c analyses showed that change in fat
intake was positively and signi®cantly related to
change in BMI in men only, while the change in
physical activity was negatively and signi®cantly
related to a change in BMI in women only. In men,
an increase in fat intake of 100 Kcal was associated
with an increase in BMI of 0.036 kgam2. In women,
an increase in physical activity by one level was
associated with a decrease in BMI of 0.12 kgam2.
For both genders, an average increase in age of
about 2 y was associated with an increase in BMI of
about 0.11 kgam2. The effect of age on BMI was
slightly greater in men than in women.
Discussion
Epidemiological evidence of the relationship between
dietary fat and body weight is suggestive but not
de®nitive.14 In general, cross-sectional studies provide
consistent evidence of the positive relationship
between dietary fat and body weight. However,
longitudinal studies have shown inconsistent results.
The reasons for this inconsistency are not clear, but it
is likely that several factors are involved. These
include genetic and metabolic factors, physical activ-
ity, smoking habit and behavioral factors such as
dieting in response to weight gain.

Cross-sectional study cannot distinguish a temporal
sequence between diet and obesity and merely estab-
lishes a non-directional relationship.14 In contrast, the
prospective study is generally considered to be a
strong epidemiological design for observational stu-
dies, providing an opportunity to examine the changes
in variables of interest. However, this type of study
may not be able to capture the effects of important
factors that do not change much over time. Clearly,
conclusions must be drawn by combining the results
from descriptive, cross-sectional and longitudinal ana-
lyses rather than considering the results from each
analysis individually.
Diet is undoubtedly one of the most important
determinants of body weight. In the population,
however, body weight is also in¯uenced by several
non-dietary factors such as physical activity, smoking
and socio-economic factors. While physical activity
and smoking are recognized as important determi-
nants of body weight, the signi®cance of socio-
economic factors should not be overlooked. For
example, it has been shown that the prevalence of
obesity in the population varies across levels of
income and education,26,27 and across categories of
occupation.10 Socio-economic factors also have strong
in¯uence on the diet. In developing countries, income
is positively correlated with intakes of fat and animal
products, and negatively correlated with carbohydrate
intake.16,18 In many situations, therefore, socio-
economic factors may be important confounders or
effect modi®ers of the relationship between diet and
body weight.
Epidemiological study of the diet-BMI relationship
is further complicated by the dif®culty in obtaining
accurate dietary data from a free-living population.
The commonly used dietary assessment methods are
subject to measurement errors, especially the error
caused by day-to-day ¯uctuation in dietary intake
above and below an individual's true long-term
intake, that is, the within-person error.15 Generally,
the effect of such an error is to weaken any evidence
of diet-disease association. We have examined this
issue in detail in another study. In brief, we have
found that within-person error substantially attenuated
the diet-BMI association, and that one way to reduce
such attenuation was to use the average of replicate
measurements of diet. For example, the regression
coef®cient of fat intake increased by two-fold and that
of energy intake increased by about 40% when the
average of three dietary recalls was used instead of a
single recall.
Results from our descriptive analysis are consistent
with the current literature pertaining to diet and body
weight in developing countries. The analysis of change
in BMI in relation to diet, suggested that increase in fat
intake, especially in conjunction with decrease in
physical activity, was positively related to weight
gain. First, results from cross-sectional and longitudinal
analyses indicated that dietary fat was positively asso-
ciated with BMI or change in BMI among men in the
study sample. It must be pointed out that our sample
consisted mostly (about 70%) of rural residents with
physically demanding occupations and high levels of
physical activity. This may partly explain the small
effect of diet on BMI in multivariable analyses. Also,
the weak association between fat intake and BMI in
longitudinal analysis may be caused by the fact that,
among these rural residents, there was very little change
in fat intake, but a large increase in physical activity
during the 1989±1991 period.
Second, there was a strong inverse relationship
between physical activity and BMI in cross-sectional
analysis and among the women in the longitudinal
analysis. The reason for a weak inverse relationship
between physical activity and BMI among men in
longitudinal analysis, is not clear. The most likely
explanation is the incomplete physical activity data.
Moreover, although a larger percentage of men
reported higher physical activity than women at both
surveys, there was a relatively smaller change in
physical activity among men between the two time
periods.

Third, resultsfrom descriptive analysis suggested that
the total energy intake is strongly in¯uenced by the
energy expenditure. Individuals with physically
demanding occupations and those who reported high
physical activity, who together constituted more than
half the study sample, reported higher total energy
intake compared to theirrespective counterparts. Carbo-
hydrate supplied most (about 70%) of their total
energy intake. On the other hand, fat and protein
intakes appear to be in¯uenced by socio-economic
factors such as residence, education and income.
These ®ndings are in general agreement with the
current literature of diet, socio-economic status, and
body weight in developing countries.16,27
Fourth, socio-economic factors such as place of
residence, education, occupation and income may
have important in¯uence on BMI in this population.
Results from descriptive and cross-sectional analyses
support this conclusion, and they are in agreement
with other studies.27 High income and education
levels, for example, were associated with high fat
intake and BMI. This observation is in direct contrast
to that seen in the industrialized countries, and such
inter-population or inter-cultural differences have
been well documented.27 None of the socio-economic
factors examined, however, was related to change in
BMI in the longitudinal analysis. Again, there was
very little change in these factors between the two
surveys. The changes in education and occupation, for
example, were negligible during the 1989±1991
period.
Finally, the descriptive analysis showed that smo-
kers had lower BMI and higher total energy intake
than non-smokers and ex-smokers. Other studies have
reported similar results.10,28 Most studies have
reported an inverse relationship between smoking
and body weight. However, we have not found such
a relationship in the multivariable analyses. The most
likely explanation is the limited data on tobacco
consumption.
Dietary fat was emphasized in this study for two
reasons. First, there has been an increasing trend in fat
consumption in China during the past decade.16,29
This trend may be attributed to the rapid economic
development and consequently, the abandonment of
low-fat traditional diets in favor of high-fat `af¯uent'
diets.16 Although fat intake in this study population is
still below the upper interim limit of 30% of total
energy intake set by the World Health Organization,
there is evidence to suggest that fat intake in China is
increasing steadily toward this level.
Second, the Chinese population, particularly those
living in the urban areas, may represent a large
number of individuals who are susceptible to the
fattening effect of a high-fat diet. Such an effect is
thought to be due to the spontaneous increase in
energy intake and hyperphagia associated with high-
fat foods.4 It is believed that when exposed to a high-
fat diet, the body fat mass must rapidly expand in
order to increase the oxidation of dietary fat, until fat
oxidation becomes commensurate with the fat content
of the diet and until the body reaches a new plateau of
weight maintenance.1 If this observation is indeed
applicable to the general population, then it may be
speculated that the Chinese population, with relatively
low BMI, may be at risk of the dynamic phase of
obesity when exposed to a high-fat diet as opposed to
the static phase of obesity normally observed in
Western populations.14
Although the susceptibility of this population
to the effect of a high-fat diet is not known, the
problem is still complicated by the fact that in
China and in many developing countries, obesity is
often associated with good health and high social
status.27 Therefore, healthy individuals who are
experiencing rapid weight gain may not perceive the
condition as hazardous to their health, and the over-
weight individuals may be indifferent to further
weight gain. In this respect, we believe that dieting
andaor a deliberate increase in physical activity in
response to weight gain, is uncommon in this study
population. The same applies to the under-reporting of
dietary intakes by overweight individuals in this
sample.
To date, the study of diet and body weight in
developing countries is very limited. The World
Health Organization has provided an excellent
review of the changing diet and disease patterns in
developing countries.16 It is now recognized that diet-
related chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular
disease, are of signi®cant importance in virtually all
countries, developing and developed alike. Thus, in
addition to the immediate problems of malnutrition
and undernutrition, the problems caused by over-
nutrition and nutrient imbalance in developing coun-
tries are of serious concern. According to the current
trend, these diseases will constitute a major threat to
the economically productive adults and subsequently,
will present a huge health-care burden on these
countries in the near future.16
