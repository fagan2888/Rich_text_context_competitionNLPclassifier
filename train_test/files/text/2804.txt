Abstract Although residential segregation is known to have declined for some
racial groups in America, much less is known about change in the relative
socioeconomic quality of the neighborhoods where different racial and ethnic
groups live. Using census data for 1980­2010, we find that the neighborhoods
where whites and minorities reside have become more alike in terms of
neighborhood poverty and median income, largely because whites now live in
poorer neighborhoods and because African Americans live in less-poor neigh-
borhoods. The narrowing of black-white neighborhood inequality since 1980
has been sizable, far exceeding the narrowing of Hispanic-white neighborhood
inequality; nonetheless, despite blacks' relative gains, the disparity in black-
white neighborhood economic conditions remains very large. Asian Americans,
on the other hand, now reside in neighborhoods that are economically similar to
the neighborhoods where whites reside. Regression analyses reveal that racial
neighborhood inequality declined the most in U.S. metropolitan areas where
racial residential segregation declined the most.

Introduction
The typical American city in the twenty-first century is characterized by residential
inequality along race and class lines. As such, neighborhoods are where the nation's
racial and economic cleavages are most visibly "etched in place" (Sampson 2012:19).
Neighborhood conditions historically have been particularly harsh for African
Americans, a legacy of disadvantage that continues today as black-white inequality
in neighborhood conditions notably exceeds black-white economic inequality at the
individual or household level (Logan 2002, 2011). Rapid growth in Hispanic and Asian
metropolitan populations--fueled by a combination of immigration, youthful age
structures, and natural increase--has only intensified interest in neighborhood inequal-
ity. Our objective in this study is to investigate change since 1980 in the relative
economic qualities of the neighborhoods where America's four major racial/ethnic
groups--Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians--live.
1
By examining change in racial inequality at the neighborhood level, this study fills
an important gap in our knowledge about racial stratification in America. Despite broad
consensus among social scientists that inequality in neighborhood environments pro-
duces inequality of opportunity for members of different racial and ethnic groups, we
have surprisingly little quantitative evidence on how fast racial neighborhood
inequality has been changing in the United States, and why. Only a few studies,
such as Timberlake (2002), have examined change in the distribution of racial
groups across all types of metropolitan neighborhoods (not just poor neighbor-
hoods), and none of these studies have used the most statistically appropriate
indexes of inequality, as we explain subsequently.
In this article, we describe change in racial neighborhood inequality in American
metropolitan areas since 1980, the first year for which we have adequate census data for
Hispanics. Our findings are based on a standard measure of inequality, the Gini index.
Because the trends we uncover have gone largely unnoticed--and in some instances
are contrary to conventional wisdom--we focus first on describing the contours of the
change in racial neighborhood inequality. Our aim in the first part of this article is to
present the most complete picture to date of change in the relative neighborhood
environments of whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians over the past three
decades in America. Then in the second part of this article we report findings
from metropolitan fixed-effects regression models designed to account for the
change we observe. Why has racial neighborhood inequality declined faster in
some metropolitan areas than in others?
Racial Neighborhood Inequality: What It Is and Why It Matters
By racial neighborhood inequality, we mean economic inequality: that is, disparity in
the poverty rates and average incomes of the neighborhoods where different racial and
1 The four groups accounted for more than 97 % of the U.S. population in 2010. Although the term "Hispanic"
is most often considered an ethnic designation, for simplicity we refer to whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians
as racial groups. "Asian" includes Pacific Islanders. The excluded populations are non-Hispanics who
indicated that they are of more than one race (1.9 % of the U.S. population in 2010), American Indian or
Alaska natives (0.7 %), and non-Hispanics who indicated "some other race" (0.2 %).

ethnic groups live, reflecting the fact that racial and ethnic groups are unevenly
distributed across rich and poor neighborhoods. In America, racial differences in
household income account for only part of this disparity; many middle-class blacks,
for example, reside in poor neighborhoods or in places surrounded by poor neighbor-
hoods (Logan 2011; Patillo 1999; Sharkey 2014). It is important, then, to distinguish
racial inequality at the neighborhood level from racial differences in poverty and
income at the individual or household level.
It is also important to distinguish racial neighborhood inequality from racial
residential segregation. Residential segregation refers to unevenness in the
distribution of groups across neighborhoods. Although racial neighborhood
inequality requires residential segregation--that is, racial groups can be uneven-
ly distributed across rich and poor neighborhoods only if groups are unevenly
distributed across neighborhoods--segregation does not preordain inequality.
Because studies of residential segregation show only that racial neighborhood
inequality is possible--and not how large it is--the extensive literature on
residential segregation alone is insufficient to draw conclusions about trends
in racial neighborhood inequality. As Alba et al. (2008:14) noted, "While
segregation indices can inform us about the extent to which members of
different groups live in different neighborhoods, they cannot tell us directly
about the `qualities' of the neighborhoods in which group members reside." If
we agree that segregation matters largely because it contributes to the relative
advantages and disadvantages of racial and ethnic groups (Cutler and Glaeser
1997; Massey and Denton 1993), then the analysis of residential segregation is
insufficient. The crucial issue is racial differences in living conditions and life
chances, not residential segregation per se.
Racial neighborhood inequality is particularly critical in America because
poorer neighborhoods typically have significantly poorer social services,
schools, and social environments, as well as less green space, higher crime
rates, and more noise and congestion (Reardon and Bischoff 2011; Sampson
et al. 1999). In terms of day-to-day existence, then, racial neighborhood in-
equality implies a lower quality of life for the average minority versus the
average white, which might be one reason that African Americans in the United
States report lower levels of happiness (Firebaugh and Schroeder 2009; Yang
2008). In addition, recent evidence suggests that prolonged exposure to poor
neighborhood environments adversely affects one's life chances along several
domains (Crowder and South 2010; Sampson et al. 2008; Sharkey and Elwert
2011; Wodtke et al. 2011), and Sampson and Wilson (1995) argued that high-
poverty environments encourage youth to pursue criminal careers. We should be
concerned about racial neighborhood inequality, then, because it is consequen-
tial for the future as well as the present, serving as a wellspring for racial
disparities in life chances now and in the days to come (Harding 2003;
Sampson et al. 2008; Sharkey 2008, 2013).
The present study is particularly timely because racial neighborhood inequal-
ity in America--although much discussed--rarely is measured directly.
Consequently, we have much evidence that minorities live in poorer neighbor-
hoods in America but relatively imprecise estimates of the degree of the
inequality, and even less precise estimates of how it has been changing.
Sizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality
Evidence Bearing on Racial Neighborhood Inequality
Many studies have documented the overrepresentation of minorities in poor neighbor-
hoods in America (Jargowsky 1996, 1997; Krivo et al. 1998; Massey 1990; Massey
and Denton 1993). Supporting evidence comes from different disciplines and starting
points. Research by urban planners and health policy researchers has found unevenness
in the "geography of opportunity" of different racial and ethnic groups with respect to
housing choice (de Souza Briggs 2005; Osypuk et al. 2009). Research by sociologists
and other social scientists focusing on locational attainment (Alba and Logan 1991;
Crowder and South 2005; Logan et al. 1996; Rosenbaum and Friedman 2006;
Sampson and Sharkey 2008; South et al. 2005; Woldoff and Ovadia 2009), on
economic segregation (Jargowsky 1996, 1997; Massey 1996; Reardon and Bischoff
2011; Wilson 1987), on concentrated disadvantage (Krivo et al. 1998; Massey and
Denton 1993; Massey and Eggers 1990; Sampson et al. 2008), and on exposure to
poverty in urban areas (de Souza Briggs and Keys 2009; Quillian 2003; Timberlake
2007; Timberlake and Iceland 2007) has also pointed to racial disparities in neighbor-
hood environments.
Despite the enormity of this literature, we found only three studies (Osypuk et al.
2009; Timberlake 2002; Timberlake and Iceland 2007) that measured racial neighbor-
hood inequality directly. Osypuk et al. (2009) found that racial neighborhood inequality
is positively associated with residential segregation across the 100 largest U.S. metro-
politan areas in 2000. Timberlake (2002) found much lower neighborhood inequality
for Asians versus whites than for Hispanics versus whites or for blacks versus whites.
In a follow-up study, Timberlake and Iceland (2007) found that although blacks
remained the most residentially disadvantaged group in 2000, they exhibited the
greatest relative improvement in neighborhood conditions from 1970 to 2000.
2
However, none of these pioneering studies employed a standard measure of inequal-
ity. At a minimum, we want a measure of inequality that meets the usual requirements
for inequality indexes (Allison 1978): the measure should be scale invariant, yielding
the same value whether income units are given in dollars or in any other currency;
should obey the principle of transfers so that transfers of income from richer to poorer
units reduce the index, and transfers in the other direction increase the index; and
should be compositionally invariant, meaning that the measure is not sensitive to
changes in the relative sizes of groups--this property is important in the current study
because of the rapidly changing racial composition of many areas in America (Lee et al.
2014). We also want an index that can measure segregation as well as inequality,
permitting a transparent estimate of the effect of racial residential segregation on racial
neighborhood inequality in our regression analyses. Finally, we want a measure that is
commonly used so that we can easily compare racial neighborhood inequality
with other types of inequality. The Gini index is the natural choice because it is
commonly used, is scale invariant, obeys the principle of transfers, has proper-
ties that are well established, is compositionally invariant (Reardon and
Firebaugh 2002), and measures segregation as well as inequality (Duncan and
2 Timberlake and Iceland (2007) expanded the Timberlake (2002) analysis by adding data for 1970 and 2000
and using a regression model to determine the predictors of racial neighborhood inequality in 2000 and its
change from 1970 to 2000.

Duncan 1955; Hutchens 2004). In addition, Gini inequality can be depicted by
Lorenz curves (Lorenz 1905). The inequality measures used in prior studies fail
to satisfy all these criteria (see the appendix).
Data
Using decennial census counts, we assess the residential circumstances of the four
principal racial/ethnic groups in America: (1) non-Hispanic whites, (2) non-Hispanic
blacks, (3) non-Hispanic Asians and Pacific Islanders, and (4) Hispanics of any race.
Recent decades have seen momentous change in the composition of the U.S. popula-
tion with respect to these groups. From 1980 to 2010, Hispanics increased from 6.4 %
to 16.3 % of the U.S. population, and Asians increased from 1.5 % to 4.8 % (Gibson
and Jung 2002; Humes et al. 2011). Although these changes are well documented,
much less is known about what shifts have occurred in the economic environments
where whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians live.
We use census-defined tracts as our measure of neighborhoods. Our tract-level data
for 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 are based on summary files from the decennial U.S.
Censuses, supplemented by the 2008­2012 American Community Surveys (ACS) for
tract-level poverty rate and median income in 2010, as noted below. These tract data
come from the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (Logan et al. 2014) and a GeoLytics
database that provides estimates for untracted areas in 1980 (GeoLytics 2004). We
include all metropolitan areas in the United States, thus capturing 77 % of the total U.S.
population in 1980 and 84 % in 2010.
3 To ensure that the trends we observe are based
on a consistent set of boundaries, we standardize the pre-2010 census tracts to 2010
boundaries. We exclude tracts where more than 25 % of the residents live in group
quarters (e.g., prisons), yielding a consistent set of 57,370 neighborhoods for each year.
To test the robustness of our results, we repeated our analyses using 2000 census tract
boundaries (from GeoLytics 2004, 2011a, b). Our conclusions are the same whether we
use the 2000 or 2010 boundaries, as well as whether we include or exclude the areas
that were not fully tracted in 1980.
To calculate racial neighborhood inequality, we need to know both the racial
composition of neighborhoods and their economic conditions. Racial composition at
the tract level is readily available from the decennial censuses. For neighborhood
economic conditions, we use long-form census data for 1980, 1990, and 2000, and
five-year ACS estimates centered on 2010 to derive two indicators: (1) tract poverty
rate (percentage of individuals living below the poverty line) and (2) median household
income. Both indicate the economic condition of neighborhoods, but they are not
redundant (r = ­.71 across tracts in 1980 and ­.59 across tracts in 2010)--and, as
Reardon and Bischoff (2011) noted, it is important to distinguish "segregation of
affluence" from "segregation of poverty." Poverty rate captures the lower end of the
neighborhood income distribution, whereas median income reflects the level of middle

area population of 50,000 or more. It is comprised of the county or counties in which the core is located as well
as any adjacent counties that are socially and economically integrated with the core. We use the OMB

and upper incomes as well. Thus, by comparing results for the two measures, we can
determine whether racial differences in neighborhood environments are greater at the
lower end of the income distribution or at the middle and upper ends of the distribution.
Note also that the ACS data set we use to measure neighborhood poverty rate and
median income in 2010 is based on surveys administered from 2008 through 2012, so
our findings include the effects of the 2008 Great Recession on racial neighborhood
inequality in America.
Racial Neighborhood Inequality, 1980­2010
Figure 1 (poverty-based inequality) and Fig. 2 (income-based inequality) display
differences in the distributions of whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian
Americans across rich and poor neighborhoods in metropolitan America by depicting
how much better off, or worse off, a group's neighborhood conditions are compared
with metropolitan residents who are not members of the group (the nonfocal popula-
tion). If whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians were distributed proportionately over
rich and poor neighborhoods, all four groups would lie on the line of equality in the
graphs: that is, 10 % of each group would reside in the bottom 10 % of neighborhoods,
20 % of each group would reside in the bottom 20 % of neighborhoods, and so on. That
is not what we find. In 1980 and in 2010, the curves for whites were well above the line
of equality, reflecting whites' greater concentration in richer-than-average neighbor-
hoods; the curves for blacks and Hispanics, on the other hand, were well below the line,
reflecting the greater concentration of blacks and Hispanics in poorer-than-average
neighborhoods. In Fig. 1, the curve for Asians closely hugs the line of equality in 1980,
indicating that Asians were the most typical Americans in 1980 in terms of the poverty
rates of the neighborhoods where they resided. The curve for Asians lies above the line
of equality in 2010, indicating that by 2010 Asians tended to live in neighborhoods
with lower-than-average poverty rates.
4
The greater the difference between the curves and the 45-degree line of equality, the
greater the degree of racial neighborhood inequality. Clearly, whites tend to live in more
economically advantaged neighborhoods than African Americans and Hispanics.
Figures 1 and 2 nonetheless reveal a substantial narrowing of the racial neighborhood
disparities since 1980. For both poverty-based and income-based neighborhood in-
equality, the curves for whites, blacks, and Hispanics were notably closer to the line of
4 We used the logic of Lorenz curves (Lorenz 1905) to create Figs. 1 and 2. First we arranged the 57,370
metropolitan census tracts from poorest to richest and calculated the cumulative percentage of our four focal
populations (whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians) and their complements (e.g., nonwhites) across the tracts.
Then we plotted the results in a graph where the x-axis is cumulative percentage of the focal group (e.g.,
whites) and the y-axis is the cumulative percentage of the remainder of the metropolitan population, the non-
focal population (e.g., nonwhites). In Fig. 1, then, the point (50, 8) on the curve for blacks in 1980 tells us that
only 8 % of nonblacks lived in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was as high as, or higher than, it was in
the average (50th percentile) neighborhood where blacks lived in 1980. Thus 92 % of nonblack Americans
lived in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was lower than in the average neighborhood where
blacks lived. Likewise, the point (9, 50) on the curve for whites tells us that only 9 % of whites lived
where the poverty rate was as high as, or higher than, it was in the average neighborhood where
nonwhites lived, so 91 % of whites lived where poverty was lower than in the average neighborhood
where nonwhites lived. In short, the racial disparities in neighborhood conditions in 1980 were huge.

equality in 2010 than they were in 1980. For blacks and Hispanics, convergence
to the line of equality represents reduction in relative neighborhood disadvan-
tage. For whites, convergence to the line of equality represents reduction in
relative neighborhood advantage. The neighborhoods where blacks and whites
live and where Hispanics and whites live have become more alike economically
since 1980.
Asians also are converging with whites, but the details differ. Rather than residing in
typical American neighborhoods, as they did in 1980, Asian Americans now live in
wealthier-than-average neighborhoods that are more similar to whites' neighborhoods,
particularly with respect to median household income. Thus instead of converging
toward the line of equality, as is the case for the black and Hispanic curves, the Asian
curve has expanded above the line, indicating an increase in residential advantage for
Asians relative to other Americans.

Sizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality
In short, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans all gained on whites
from 1980 to 2010, so change in racial neighborhood inequality over that period is a
story of declining white relative advantage. The proximate causes are improved
neighborhood conditions for blacks along with greater deterioration in neigh-
borhood conditions for whites than for Hispanics and Asians. In 1980, one-half
of blacks lived in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was greater than 21.8
%, and the other half where the rate was less than 21.8 % (Fig. 3). Contrast
this with the situation for whites in 1980, when one-half lived in neighborhoods
where the poverty rate was less than 6.9 %. The black-white difference
narrowed from 1980 to 2010, with the median neighborhood poverty rate
increasing to 8.6 % for whites and declining to 18.9 % for blacks. Although
the difference that remains is pronounced, the point we want to underscore here
is that the reduction in black-white neighborhood inequality is due both to
higher poverty rates in the neighborhoods where whites live and to lower rates
in the neighborhoods where blacks live.
The average neighborhood where Hispanics live had a higher poverty rate in
2010 than in 1980, but the percentage increase was less for Hispanics than for
whites (13 % vs. 25 % for whites), resulting in a modest reduction in Hispanic-
white neighborhood inequality. Median neighborhood poverty rate increased
much less for Asians than for whites from 2000 to 2010, and it is noteworthy
that by 2010 the median poverty rate was about the same in the neighborhoods
of Asians and of whites (Fig. 3).
When Did the Narrowing Occur?
As Fig. 3 suggests, the narrowing of racial neighborhood inequality in America
from 1980 to 2010 was due to the relative gains of minorities on whites, as
neighborhood conditions improved for blacks and deteriorated faster for whites
than for Hispanics and Asians. When did those gains occur? Figure 4 displays

5 Figure 4 shows that the difference between Asians and whites,
which was modest in 1980, had largely disappeared by 2010. In the remainder of this
article, then, we focus on disparities for African Americans and Hispanics.
Figure 4 reveals five critical facts about black-white and Hispanic-white neighbor-
hood inequality in America. First, the degree of neighborhood inequality in 1980 was
severe, especially for blacks (the black-white Gini was .69 based on poverty and .62
based on income).6 Second, black-white neighborhood inequality showed a sizable
decline from 1980 to 2010; as measured by the Gini, poverty-based neighborhood
inequality declined by nearly 40 %, and income-based neighborhood inequality de-
clined by nearly 30 %, in the average metropolitan area over the period.
Third, for both blacks and Hispanics, poverty-based neighborhood inequality de-
clined more than income-based inequality, indicating that the disparities in neighbor-
hood conditions for blacks and Hispanics vis-à-vis whites narrowed more in terms of
poverty rate than in terms of average neighborhood income. Apparently, convergence
in the distribution of racial groups across poorer and richer neighborhoods was more
pronounced at the lower end of the neighborhood income continuum.
Fourth, black-white neighborhood inequality declined much faster than Hispanic-
white inequality. For both poverty-based and income-based neighborhood inequality,
the Gini coefficients in 1980 were one-third greater for blacks and whites than for
5 The Gini coefficient is a function of the area between the group curves and the line of equality (Gini 1912,
1921). Gini coefficients range from 0 to 1 in absolute value, with a value of 0 indicating no difference in the
economic conditions of neighborhoods for the groups being compared, and a value of 1 indicating that all
members of the advantaged group live in richer neighborhoods than all members of the disadvantaged group
(complete neighborhood inequality). The Gini values in Fig. 4 are weighted by size of the minority population
so that metropolitan areas with larger minority populations are given more weight.

Hispanics and whites. By 2010, black-white and Hispanic-white neighborhood inequal-
ity was virtually the same when we average the metro-level Gini values. This does not
necessarily mean that Hispanics reside in neighborhoods as poor as those where blacks
reside given that the comparison here is between blacks and whites who live in the
same area with Hispanics and whites who live in the same metropolitan area, and
Hispanics might be concentrated in metropolitan areas where whites tend to be more
affluent than in the metropolitan areas where blacks live. When we adjust for regional
differences in the affluence of whites by ignoring metropolitan boundaries, we find that,
as of 2010, blacks still lived in poorer neighborhoods than Hispanics, but the differ-
ences are small (Fig. 5). Importantly, then, black-Hispanic neighborhood disparities
have narrowed greatly since 1980. If these trends continue, Hispanics will reside in
poorer neighborhoods than African Americans in the near future.
Finally, Fig. 4 shows that racial neighborhood inequality declined the most during
the 1980s and the 2000s. This is true for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian
Americans. The narrowing of racial neighborhood inequality during the 2000s, the
decade that included the Great Recession, is attributable largely to a near-doubling of
the number of whites living in "poverty areas" (i.e., census tracts with poverty rates
above 20 %).7 Between 2000 and 2010, the poverty rate for whites increased, and the
percentage of poor whites living in poverty areas jumped from about 25 % to about 38 %.
As a result, the number of whites living in poverty areas grew from 3.8 million to 7.5
million (Bishaw 2014). Because the percentage of poor nonwhites living in poverty areas
7 The decline is not due to measurement error in the ACS data for 2010. Our cross checks of similar data in the
ACS and decennial census data revealed virtually identical results. For example, the decennial census and the
ACS both collected data on homeownership at the tract level, and the Gini for black versus nonblack
ownership across tracts was .312 based on the decennial census and .310 based on ACS data.

were more racially diverse by 2010 than in the past (Jargowsky 2014).
The increasing racial diversity of poor areas--poor whites living with poor minori-
ties--is notable in light of recent evidence of a growing income divide among America's
neighborhoods (Massey et al. 2009; Reardon and Bischoff 2011). Perhaps the reduction
in racial neighborhood inequality has been driven partly by the increasing economic
segregation of America's neighborhoods as middle-income blacks and Hispanics are
less likely, and poor whites are more likely, to live in poor neighborhoods. To investigate
this idea, among others, we regress our measures of racial neighborhood inequality at the
metropolitan level on metropolitan characteristics that are likely to be associated with an
area's level of inequality. We now describe the model we use.
Accounting for the Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality
The Three Pillars of Racial Neighborhood Inequality
To reveal the characteristics of metropolitan areas that are associated with the greater
decline in some metropolitan areas than in others, we perform a series of regression
analyses based on metropolitan-level census data for 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. We
begin by noting that racial neighborhood inequality in America rests on three pillars. The
first pillar is difference in the racial composition of neighborhoods: racial residential
segregation. The second pillar is difference in the average incomes in neighborhoods:
neighborhood income segregation. Racial neighborhood economic inequality would be
impossible if all neighborhoods were the same economically. The third pillar is racial
income inequality at the household level. Blacks and Hispanics live in poorer neighbor-
hoods in part because of their lower incomes (Clark 1986; Firebaugh and Farrell 2011).
We theorize that racial neighborhood inequality has changed because of change in
each of the three pillars. Residential segregation has declined, although much faster for
blacks and whites than for Hispanics and whites, which could account for the faster
decline in black-white neighborhood inequality than in Hispanic-white neighborhood
inequality. Racial income inequality was U-shaped over this period, with census
data showing that median household income grew faster for Hispanics and
blacks than for whites from 1980 to 2000 and then declined faster for
Hispanics and blacks than for whites from 2000 to 2010. This U-shaped pattern in
relative incomes for the United States as a whole masks differences across metropolitan
areas, and we expect to find that racial neighborhood inequality declined faster in areas
where minorities gained on whites economically than in areas where they did not.
The effect of change in neighborhood income segregation is harder to predict
because of the possibility of compensating effects. After differences in household
income are adjusted for, blacks and Hispanics tend to live in much poorer neighbor-
hoods than whites. Sharkey (2014) found, for example, that the average black house-
hold with annual earnings of $100,000 lives in a more disadvantaged neighborhood
than a white household with annual earnings of less than $30,000 (see also Logan 2002,
2011, 2013; Massey and Fischer 1999; Quillian 2012; Reardon et al. 2015; Woldoff
and Ovadia 2009). Thus, in tightening the link between household income and
neighborhood income, rising income segregation could "squeeze out" some of the
Sizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality
neighborhood underplacement of minorities and overplacement of whites by reducing
the proportion of middle-class blacks and Hispanics in poor neighborhoods and
increasing the proportion of poor whites in poor neighborhoods.8 On the other hand,
to the extent that rising income segregation is due to widening differences in average
incomes across neighborhoods as opposed to narrowing income variance within
neighborhoods, growing income segregation might increase racial neighborhood
inequality by magnifying the effect of the income advantage of whites. If the two
effects are offsetting, rising neighborhood income segregation might have little net
effect on racial neighborhood inequality.
In short, we predict that racial neighborhood inequality declined the most in
metropolitan areas where residential segregation declined the most and where minor-
ities gained the most on whites economically. We speculate that the effect of change in
income segregation will be modest because of the (possibly) opposing effects of
declining within-neighborhood and increasing between-neighborhood income vari-
ance. To test these predictions, we estimated the following fixed-effects model for
U.S. metropolitan areas in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, where the subscripts j and t
denote metropolitan area and time, respectively:

Equation (1) is designed to test our central idea that racial neighborhood inequality is
rooted in racial segregation, racial inequality, and neighborhood income segregation. The
equation states that racial neighborhood inequality (RNI) for a given metropolitan area is
determined by the three pillars of racial neighborhood inequality--level of racial residen-
tial segregation, degree of minorities' economic disadvantage, and income segregation of
the area's neighborhoods--as well as by other economic and demographic features of the
area. The year dummy variables (Year) capture secular trends that are not accounted for by
other variables in the model, and Size (measured by log of population) captures the effect
of unaccounted-for differences between larger and smaller metropolitan areas.
By using a metropolitan fixed-effects model (Metroj
), we eliminate the confounding
effects of stable unmeasured characteristics of metropolitan areas that have constant
effects over time (Allison 2005). These include potentially important confounders--
such as topography, culture, and region of the country--that vary from area to area but
are stable (or relatively so) over time. To control for pertinent characteristics that change
over time, the Z term includes census measures of an area's economic and demographic
characteristics (e.g., overall poverty rate, proportion foreign-born). Because it is reason-
able to assume that neighborhood change is more likely where many people are moving
in or out and where new neighborhoods are sprouting up, we include variables designed
to capture change in population composition or in housing stock (e.g., rate of new
8 Quillian (2012) found that concentrated poverty among blacks and Hispanics in America is due largely to the
poverty of their other-race neighbors: for example, middle-class blacks living beside poor nonblacks. Rising
income segregation could reduce that cross-race effect.

housing construction, proportion of labor force in the Armed Forces). A complete list of
the control variables is found in Table 2 of the appendix.
Measurement
Racial residential segregation (ResSeg) is the uneven distribution of racial groups across
neighborhoods, and residential income segregation (IncomeSeg) is the uneven distribution
of average household income across neighborhoods. We measure both using the Gini
index.
9 We use the minority/white poverty ratio to measure degree of minority economic
disadvantage in our models of poverty-based racial neighborhood inequality and the ratio
of white/minority average household income10 to measure minority disadvantage in our
models of income-based racial neighborhood inequality. For both ratios, higher values
indicate greater economic disadvantage for the minority group, implying a positive
coefficient given that we expect racial neighborhood inequality to be the greatest in areas
where minorities are the most greatly disadvantaged. Because the variables in our
regressions are measured at the metropolitan level, we expect little measurement error in
the 2010 ACS data, which are based on five years centered on 2010.
All our models include population size as a control variable. Controlling for
population size nonetheless does not solve the issue of whether, for areas with the
same total population, analyses of racial neighborhood inequality should give more
weight to the area with more minority residents. Our solution is to compare results for
alternative weighting schemes: (a) all 366 metropolitan areas, not weighted by the
minority group of interest; (b) same as (a), but restricted to areas where the minority
population of interest exceeds 10,000; and (c) all areas, weighted by size of the
minority group of interest. We report results for each of the weighting schemes.
Findings
Table 1 presents the estimated effects of the three pillar variables and population size,
with and without the control variables. The findings are clear. Change in black-white
and Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality from 1980 to 2010 was driven by change
in residential segregation and by change in minority economic disadvantage. The effect
of residential segregation is especially large, with regression coefficients approaching
or exceeding 1.0. Because segregation and inequality are both measured in Gini units,
this result indicates that a decline in racial neighborhood segregation is associated with
a commensurate decline in racial neighborhood inequality. Also noteworthy is that the
effects are as large for Hispanics as they are for African Americans.
9 We use Duncan and Duncan's (1955) formula for calculating the Gini based on the difference in two
cumulative distributions. For residential income segregation, we calculate the Gini from the cumulative
distributions of population and income across the 57,370 neighborhoods, where the neighborhoods are
arranged from poorest to richest on the basis of median income. In the case of residential segregation from
whites, we order neighborhoods on the basis of minority composition (e.g., from neighborhoods with highest
% black to those with lowest % black), and calculate the Gini from the cumulative distribution of the minority
group across the neighborhoods compared with the cumulative distribution of whites across the
neighborhoods.
10 We substitute family income for household income in 1980 because household income was not broken
down by race in the 1980 census. The correlation of (overall) average family income with average household
income was .98 across metropolitan areas in 1980.

Notes: Standard errors, shown in parentheses, are adjusted for clustering. The base model includes dummy
variables for year. To save space, we report those results--along with results for the additional 14 control variables
in the full model--in Table 2 of the appendix. The N > 10,000 analysis is restricted to areas where the relevant
minority population was greater than 10,000 (for at least two of the four census years, because metropolitan fixed-
effects estimates are based on change within metropolitan areas). Racial neighborhood inequality, residential
segregation, and neighborhood income segregation are measured using the Gini index. Minority economic
disadvantage is measured as the minority/white ratio of poverty rates in the case of poverty-based neighborhood
inequality and as the white/minority ratio of average incomes in the case of income-based neighborhood inequality.
a Random-effects estimation yields similar results.
*p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001
Sizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality
The findings are also very robust. The coefficients for residential segregation and
minority economic disadvantage change very little when we add control variables,
indicating that the observed effects of changing residential segregation and changing
minority disadvantage are not attributable to their correlations with changes in other
metropolitan characteristics. Moreover, we find consistent results for residential segre-
gation and minority disadvantage whether or not we weight areas by size of minority
population: all 24 of the coefficients for residential segregation, and 21 of the 24
coefficients for minority disadvantage, are positive and statistically significant.
As predicted, then, racial neighborhood inequality has declined with declining racial
segregation and with declining economic disadvantage for minority populations. With
regard to residential income segregation--the theorized third pillar of racial neighbor-
hood inequality--the coefficients are either positive or not statistically significant.
Thus, we find no evidence for the "squeeze hypothesis" that rising income segregation
in the United States has depressed racial neighborhood inequality by elevating the
importance of income, and reducing the importance of race, as the basis for sorting
households into neighborhoods.
Finally, it is noteworthy that a relatively simple model--the three pillar variables,
population size, and dummy variables for year--does a good job of explaining why racial
neighborhood inequality changed more in some metropolitan areas than in others.
(Random-effects estimation (not shown) yields even stronger results.) The 14 control
variables do not add much to the explained variance, nor do they materially affect the
estimates for residential segregation and minority disadvantage, as we have noted. Our
results for the control variables (see Table 2 in the appendix) indicate that, all other things
being equal, poverty-based black-white neighborhood inequality diminished when pro-
portion poor declined and when proportion Hispanic and proportion foreign-born grew. In
the case of income-based black-white neighborhood inequality, only two control vari-
ables--proportion foreign-born and unemployment rate--had significant effects. For
Hispanics, both poverty-based and income-based neighborhood inequality with whites
tended to be reduced by growth in proportion homeowners and in proportion elderly and
by reductions in average income, proportion black, and proportion suburban (other things
being equal). In addition, poverty-based (but not income-based) Hispanic-white neigh-
borhood inequality was affected by change in an area's poverty rate, proportion Hispanic,
and proportion foreign-born (see Table 2 in the appendix for complete results).
Limitations
We began this study by examining trends in racial neighborhood inequality for all 366
U.S. metropolitan areas. We found that from 1980 to 2010, black-white neighborhood
inequality declined much faster than Hispanic-white or Asian-white neighborhood
inequality. Because neighborhood segregation also declined faster for blacks and whites
than for the other dyads, this finding suggests that change in residential segregation
played an important role in reducing racial neighborhood inequality. Our regression
results indeed confirm a strong link between segregation and inequality. For both black-
white inequality and Hispanic-white inequality, declines in segregation within a metro-
politan area were associated with comparable declines in neighborhood inequality.
Although our findings reveal important new information about racial neighborhood
inequality in America, there are limitations to what our data and model can investigate.
G. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell
In particular, by focusing on change in segregation and inequality within metropolitan
areas, our fixed-effects analysis does not address the question of how migration across
regions and metropolitan areas has affected racial neighborhood inequality for the
nation as a whole--an important issue in light of the "new faces in new places"
described in Massey (2008) and elsewhere (Hall 2013; Iceland 2009; Iceland et al.
2013). From the fixed-effects regressions, we observe a virtual one-to-one correspon-
dence (in Gini units) between change in segregation and change in inequality within
metropolitan areas. For metropolitan America as whole, however, the decline in Gini
inequality exceeded the decline in Gini segregation. Presumably this is due, at least in
part, to migration patterns across regions and metropolitan areas. We leave that question
for future research.
Moreover, with tract-level data, we cannot directly examine change in the race-
specific association between household socioeconomic status (SES) and neighborhood
economic conditions. Because blacks and Hispanics very often live in much poorer
neighborhoods than whites and Asians with similar incomes, we might expect racial
neighborhood inequality to diminish as income becomes more decisive in determining
one's neighborhood. Yet we find no evidence that rising income segregation has reduced
racial neighborhood inequality net of residential segregation and other neighborhood
characteristics. If the growing income segregation of neighborhoods in America has
narrowed income differences within neighborhoods--so that neighbors tend to be more
similar in terms of income--then this narrowing apparently either has not materially
boosted the proportion of affluent blacks and Hispanics in affluent neighborhoods or of
poor whites and Asians in poor neighborhoods, or its effect has been muted by other
consequences of rising income segregation. A full account of how rising income
segregation affects racial neighborhood inequality must await more targeted investiga-
tions of the issue based on merged household- and neighborhood-level data.
Discussion
A long-standing feature of American society is that whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians
tend to live in different residential areas. Because this separation of groups remains high
and is thought to have harmful consequences for minorities, residential segregation has
been the subject of much research. However, separate is not necessarily unequal, and it is
racial inequality in neighborhood environments, and the consequences of that inequality,
that we should ultimately be most concerned about. It is well established that residence in a
poor neighborhood is associated with heightened exposure to various social ills (such as
crime) and reduced access to resources and services (such as good medical facilities and
schools). As a result, racial inequality at the neighborhood level likely serves as the origin
of many other types of racial disparities in American society by limiting the access of
disadvantaged minorities to jobs, education, healthcare, and beneficial social networks.
Although concerns about racial neighborhood inequality are not new (Du Bois 1899;
Myrdal 1944), we know much more about change in residential segregation than we do
about change in racial neighborhood inequality, in part because racial neighborhood
inequality has not been measured with a standard inequality index.
Using the Gini index of inequality, we find that racial neighborhood inequality is
very large and pervasive in America's metropolitan areas. We also find that it has
Sizable Decline in Racial Neighborhood Inequality
declined significantly over the three decades spanning 1980­2010 as whites have
become less relatively advantaged, and blacks in particular have become less relatively
disadvantaged. In 1980, blacks lived in the poorest neighborhoods by far, followed by
Hispanics and then Asians. Over the next 30 years, neighborhood conditions improved
for all three minority groups relative to whites, with blacks exhibiting the greatest
improvement. By 2010, although black metropolitan residents continued to live in the
most-disadvantaged neighborhoods, on average, neighborhood poverty rates and me-
dian incomes were much more similar for blacks and Hispanics than in 1980. Whites in
2010 were no longer unambiguously the most advantaged group in terms of residential
economic environment: by 2010, Asians in many metropolitan areas resided in neigh-
borhoods with lower poverty rates and higher median incomes than the neighborhoods
where whites resided. Interestingly, income-based inequality declined more slowly than
poverty-based inequality, perhaps indicating that the racial concentration of affluence is
harder to reduce than the racial concentration of poverty.
A large portion of the 1980­2010 decline in black-white neighborhood inequality
occurred between 2000 and 2010. At first blush, this recent reduction in black-white
racial neighborhood inequality is surprising in light of evidence that the Great
Recession had the most damaging effects on housing for African Americans (Hall
et al. 2015; Kochhar et al. 2011; Rugh and Massey 2010). Consider, however, that the
proportion of majority-black neighborhoods experiencing what Freeman and Cai
(2015) called a "white invasion" (an increase in the white population exceeding 5 %
of the total tract population) was greater from 2000 to 2010 than in the two previous
decades combined (Freeman and Cai 2015). Moreover, virtually all the reduction in
black hypersegregation over the 30-year period occurred since 2000, with the number
of hypersegregated metropolitan areas in America declining by more than one-third
from 2000 to 2010 (Massey and Tannen 2015). In the same vein, Owens (2012) found
that from 1970 to 2009, the highest proportion of minority neighborhoods experienced
"socioeconomic ascent" after 2000. Our finding of a substantial decline in black-white
neighborhood inequality after 2000 is also less surprising in light of the near-doubling
of the number of poor whites living in poverty areas from 2000 to 2010 (Bishaw 2014)
combined with the growing number of middle-class African Americans who have
escaped poor neighborhoods (Lacy 2007; Reardon and Bischoff 2011; Sharkey 2014).
After documenting the decline in black-white neighborhood inequality between
1980 and 2010, we used metropolitan fixed-effects regression to isolate the key drivers
of the decline. The regression results contribute to knowledge about racial neighbor-
hood inequality in three ways. First, the analyses reveal a very tight association
between change in racial neighborhood inequality and change in racial residential
segregation across U.S. metropolitan areas, with coefficients that approach or exceed
1.0 for the effect of segregation. As Massey and Denton (1993) insisted more than two
decades ago, residential segregation serves as the foundation for black-white disparities
in neighborhood economic conditions in America. Thus, when black-white segregation
declines, we expect black-white neighborhood inequality to decline as well. Second, we
discover that the association between neighborhood segregation and racial neighbor-
hood inequality applies to neighborhood income as well as to neighborhood poverty.
Prior research has focused on the effect of residential segregation on neighborhood
poverty. Third, we find that the association between neighborhood segregation and
neighborhood inequality is as strong for Hispanics and whites as it is for blacks and
G. Firebaugh, C.R. Farrell
whites. Apparently, Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality is determined by the same
forces as black-white neighborhood inequality, so Hispanic-white neighborhood in-
equality has declined more slowly than black-white neighborhood inequality largely
because the decline in Hispanic-white segregation has lagged greatly behind the decline
in black-white segregation.
The Divergence That Remains
Over the 1980­2010 period, black-white neighborhood inequality in the average
metropolitan area declined by nearly 40 % based on neighborhood poverty and by
nearly 30 % based on neighborhood median income. Despite this impressive reduction
in black-white--and, to a lesser extent, in Hispanic-white--neighborhood inequality,
large differences remain. To emphasize that point, we conclude by presenting the black-
white and Hispanic-white Lorenz curves for neighborhood inequality in 2010. Figure 6
shows the Lorenz curves for poverty-based and income-based black-white and
Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality in 2010 for U.S. metropolitan areas as a
whole, ignoring metropolitan boundaries. (Unlike Figs. 1 and 2, where blacks are
compared with nonblacks and Hispanics are compared with non-Hispanics, Fig. 6
compares blacks with whites and Hispanics with whites.) From these curves, we see
the disparity that remains in the poverty rates and median household incomes of the
neighborhoods where whites live versus where Hispanics live and where blacks live.
For example, the poverty-based Lorenz curve for Hispanics and whites includes the
point (50, 18), indicating that 82 % (that is, 100 % ­ 18 %) of whites live in
neighborhoods where the poverty rate is lower than in the average (50th percentile)
neighborhood where Hispanics live.
The disparity in neighborhood economic conditions is slightly greater for blacks
versus whites: 84 % of whites live in neighborhoods where the poverty rate is lower
than in the average neighborhood where blacks live. Even poor whites often fail to
experience the levels of neighborhood disadvantage that are experienced by many

despite three decades of change, that color line remains a defining problem for our
fledgling century as well.

Appendix: Measures of Inequality
Because inequality is a type of dispersion--a property of distributions as a whole--
measures of inequality should take into account all points on a distribution. Measures
that are based on a single point, or on parts of a distribution, fail to reflect intuition
about inequality, such as the principle that inequality is reduced when income is
transferred from a richer person to a poorer person (the transfer principle: Allison
1978; Cowell 2011). With respect to racial neighborhood inequality, the transfer
principle means that inequality declines when a member of a disadvantaged group
moves to a higher income neighborhood. The Gini measure we use is consistent with
the transfer principle because it is based on the cumulative percentage of racial groups
in neighborhoods. Hence, the Gini declines as the proportion of disadvantaged group
members increases in higher-income neighborhoods.
The inequality measures used in prior studies do not necessarily capture the inequality-
reducing or inequality-increasing effects of changes in the racial composition of rich and
poor neighborhoods. Measures based on the interquartile range, for example, fail to capture
the change in inequality resulting from change within quartiles. Osypuk et al. (2009) used
two novel measures that reflect the amount of overlap of the distributions of the two groups
being compared. Because the measures are based on a single point on the Lorenz curve of
inequality, however, they fail to obey the transfer principle for inequality measures.
11
The Timberlake (2002) and Timberlake and Iceland (2007) studies were based on
the Index of Net Difference, or p(A > B) minus p(B > A), where p(A > B) is the
probability that a randomly selected member of group A lives in a higher-ranking
neighborhood than a randomly selected member of group B. Because it is unconven-
tional, the use of this measure makes it difficult to gauge the size of racial neighborhood
inequality relative to other types of inequality.
11 The distributional overlap measure of Osypuk et al. (2009) is based on the point on the Lorenz curve where
the coordinates sum to 100: for example, the point might be (80, 20), indicating that only 20 % of members of
the richer group live in neighborhoods as poor as or poorer than the neighborhoods of residence for 80 % of
the members of the poorer group. The greater the distance of this point from (50, 50), the point of equality, the
greater the inequality. The second measure is likewise based on a single point, so it also fails to obey the
transfer principle.
