Abstract
Previous studies indicate that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not experience
optical illusions in the same manner as individuals with typical development. This study uses
pupillary responses as an objective measure of perception of visual illusions, with the
hypothesis that adults with ASD will show weaker pupillary constrictions to the illusions than
adults without ASD. An eye-tracker was used to investigate the spontaneous pupillary changes to
brightness illusions in adults diagnosed with ASD (N ¼ 11) and in a control group (N ¼ 24).
Contrary to the hypothesis, the ASD group showed similar pupillary constrictions to the
illusory bright stimuli as the control group. Therefore, this study does not support the idea
that individuals with ASD have a veridical perception of these types of illusions and instead
suggest that atypical perception of illusions does not constitute a universal characteristic of
aspect of high-functioning individuals with ASD.

It is a general observation that many individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) have atypical visual perception (Behrmann,
Thomas, & Humphreys, 2006; Hadad, Goldstein, & Russo, 2017; Hermelin & O'Connor,
1970; Simmons et al., 2009). Some studies report that individuals with ASD do not experience
optical illusions in the same way as individuals with typically development and that, in fact,
their perceptions are more realistic or closer to the physical input. For example, Happe
´ (1996)
found that individuals with ASD tended to show a lower susceptibility to visual illusions like
the Ebbinghaus (aka Titchener) illusion. The two central, black, circles were reported to be of
the same size, as they actually are, instead of smaller or larger when surrounded by larger or
smaller circles, respectively, as it is in the typical (illusory) perception.

These findings have led to attempts to describe and explain visual processing in individuals
with ASD, mainly for two reasons: (a) atypical perceptual processing may reveal a key aspect
of ASD that seems different from the main diagnostic features of the disorder (Simmons
et al., 2009) and (b) such atypical perception suggests the possibility that the disruption of
some fundamental mechanism of perception and learning may relate to a variety of
difficulties experienced by individuals with ASD, including those expressed in social
communication and behavior (Dakin & Frith, 2005; Hadad et al., 2017).
There are several novel theoretical accounts of atypical perception in people with ASD
(Behrmann et al., 2006; Samson, Mottron, Soulieres, & Zeffiro, 2012). Apparently, they all
take their starting point from the observation that perception in people with ASD is
characterized by a greater reliance than normal on the sensory input, especially in
ambiguous situations (Lawson, Rees, & Friston, 2014). These accounts propose a weaker
influence of top-down expectations on perception in people with ASD. Normally, prior
experiences with sensory information, either at the individual or species level, would shape
``perceptual hypotheses'' (or ``unconscious inferences''; Gregory, 1980; Helmholtz, 1860) that
assist the interpretation of incoming information, especially when ambiguous or unexpected
(Evers et al., 2014; Hohwy, 2013).
In the visual domain, optical illusions would constitute a paradigmatic example of the
operation of top-down factors. That is, the perceptual experience goes beyond the
information given and reflects an inference of what is either likely to be present (e.g., a
specific three-dimensional shape or scene given only two-dimensional cues) or what is
about to take place in the immediately near future (as in the flash-lag illusion or
brightness illusions; Changizi, 2009; Hohwy, Paton, & Palmer, 2016). As put by Palmer,
Seth, and Hohwy (2015): ``What we are perceptually aware of, at any given moment, is
the state of the world that is calculated as being most likely to be causing the sensory
input that our brain receives'' and perception ``[. . .] specifies what sensory input would be
received if a certain set of causes existed in the world'' (p. 377). Hence, people with ASD may
process visual information not only in a different way than other people but, more
specifically, according to a cognitive style that can be described as resulting in a more
``veridical'' perception (as suggested within a Bayesian perspective of vision; see Mottron
et al., 2013; Pellicano & Burr, 2012). Specifically, individuals with ASD may attend and
perceive the sensory world in a manner that gives them (as a group) ``a privileged access
to parts and details'' (Frith, 1989; Frith & Happe
´ , 1994).
Research on optical illusions can provide a rather privileged window into what ``prior
hypotheses'' the visual system uses when attempting to make sense of ambiguous stimuli. In a
previous study from our laboratory on optical illusions of brightness, Laeng and Endestad
(2012) showed that fast physiological adjustments of the size of the eye pupil occur when
healthy individuals viewed the brightness illusion (illustrated in Figure 1, left). Such a
physiological response seems consistent with the interpretation of a scene on the basis of
the natural statistics of the world, given that the convergent arrangement of the gradually
lighter ends of the elements of the pattern is consistent with a perceptual inference of a bright
source of light, at the center of the figure, as it may occur in nature when looking directly at
the sun through a canopy of leaves. Intuitively, the experience of an individual (or perhaps of
the species) in similar situations has been associated with a particular physical state that
could likely lead to ``glare'' and therefore a ``dazzling'' effect of strong light on the eyes, a
situation that could temporarily incapacitate vision. Hence, a reduction in the size of the
pupil would seem to represent a very adaptive response of the visual system to a probable
situation, although according to the actual stimulation there is really no difference between
the spectral returns of the internal region of the figure and of its surrounding. Thus, visual
2 i-Perception 9(3)
illusions of this kind can be used to gauge the extent in which (groups of) individuals differ in
their use of prior knowledge about the visual world, so that accuracy in perception or
``closeness to physical reality'' may be either enhanced or reduced (Pellicano & Burr,
2012). Moreover, physiological measures of illusion susceptibility may be particularly
valuable for understanding the relationship between autism and illusory perception, since
such variables may be less influenced by decisional strategies. Finally, we note the fact that
pupil size is outside voluntary control, differently from eye movements or blinking (Laeng,
Sirois, & Gredeba
¨ ck, 2012), and that this measure therefore could provide a unique
perspective into the ``nonconscious inferences'' of the perceptual system.
However, not every study has found atypical illusion perception in individuals with ASD
(Manning, Morgan, Allen, & Pellicano, 2017; Ropar & Mitchell, 1999, 2001) and it seems
likely that not every optical illusion may be affected (e.g., the Muller-Lyer illusion; Happe
´ ,
1996). Hence, it is relevant to document the occurrence and types of atypical perception in
order to understand, at the empirical and theoretical levels, the whole constellation of
cognitive changes that can occur in individuals with ASD. Specifically, charting what types
of illusory phenomena are absent and which are preserved would contribute to identify
perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that may be involved in the development of autistic
features. For example, Maule, Stanworth, Pellicano, and Franklin (2016) have observed that
color adaptation seems to function typically in adults with ASD (in contrast to reduced
aftereffects for faces or numerosity; e.g., Ewing, Pellicano, & Rhodes, 2013; Turi et al.,
2018). They concluded that, because color adaptation effects occur very early in the stream
of visual processing (in part already in the retina), these effects may be less subject to
differences in the influence of top-down expectations.
The previous studies included mainly children and adolescents and control
groups matched in age. However, younger children are in general less prone to
optical illusions than adults, and there appears to be a developmental progression with age
in the strength of illusory perceptions (e.g., Kova
´ cs, 2000; Nayar, Franchak, Adolph, &
Kiorpes, 2015). Hence, it is relevant to investigate individuals with ASD in other, older,
age-groups.
In addition, studies of optical illusions in people with ASD (but also, in general, in
individuals with typical development) have been based on introspective reports about size
or shape judgments. Yet, it is also possible to study responses to illusions with behavioral

responses (e.g., adjusting grip in the Ebbinghaus illusion) or with psychophysiological
methods that measure responses that cannot be voluntarily controlled, such as
the pupillary response. Indeed, in our laboratory, we found a constrictive response of the
eye pupil to illusory brightness in individuals with typical functioning (Laeng & Endestad,
2012; Zavagno, Tommasi, & Laeng, 2017), as if the eye reacted (or prepared to react) to a
physical increase in light emission or reflectance. Most relevant, we compared pupil
responses to the illusory brightness display with an isoluminant control image,
corresponding to 180 rotations of all the gradients that induce the brightness illusion (as
illustrated in Figure 1, right), that does not engender the same experience of glare in the
center of the image (in fact, it tends to yield the impression of a darker and duller region
compared to original illusion's central hole as well as the surrounding background). Since the
constrictions in pupillary size when viewing the brightness illusion or its control image cannot
be ascribed to changes in physical light energy or visual contrast, these findings strongly
reveal the influence of perceptual hypotheses at a very early level of sensory processing
(Laeng & Endestad, 2012).
This study explores the perception of brightness illusions in adults with ASD and a
control group of adults with typical development. An infrared eye-tracker was used to
measure the pupil diameters of the participants while they observed the illusion of
brightness and a control image. If the group with ASD showed a weakened or absent
illusory perception of brightness and related physiological changes, this would support the
assumption that people with ASD tend to have a more veridical representation of the visual
input (Pellicano & Burr, 2012). Consistent with the expected change in physiological
responses, individuals with ASD should be less prone than controls to experience and
report the brightness illusion.
Methods
Participants
Participants in the ASD group (N ¼ 16) were recruited through Autismeforeningen i Norge
(Norwegian Autism Association). All had been diagnosed with the ICD-10 (World Health
Organization, 1992) by experienced clinicians. Five individuals with ASD were excluded from
all analysis, since they were not able to keep fixation within a region of interest (ROI) of 3 of
visual angle, centered on the fixation cross and overlapping the white central region within all
patterns, for at least 90% of the time. Hence, 11 individuals with ASD were included in the
analyses (8 men, mean age ¼ 37.8 years, SE ¼ 4.01; range ¼ 23­65). The control group
consisted of 24 individuals (10 men, mean age ¼ 29.9 years, SE ¼ 2.4; range ¼ 23­66); the
two groups did not differ significantly by age; F(1, 33) ¼ 3.3, p ¼ .08. All participants had self-
reported correct or corrected-to-normal vision (by use of glasses or contact lenses). No
participants had other neurological or psychological conditions. The final ASD group
(N ¼ 11) had an average percent dwell time around fixation ¼ 95.5%, whereas the Control
group maintained gaze within the ROI for a 96.9% of the time. The two groups did not differ
in average pupil size at baseline (ASD ¼ 11.3; SE ¼ 0.5; Controls ¼ 12.3; SE ¼ 0.4). Eleven
participants with ASD and 18 of the participants in the control group completed a test of
fluid intelligence at the end of the session: the Standard Progressive Matrices by J. C. Raven
(ßOxford Psychologist Press Ltd). The ASD group had a lower average score (mean ¼ 36.5;
SE ¼ 3.1) than the Control group (mean ¼ 49.1; SE ¼ 1.4); F(1, 33) ¼ 17.7, p ¼ .0003. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the project was approved by The
Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK Sør-Øst; approval
number 2014/1192).
4 i-Perception 9(3)
Stimuli, Apparatus, and Procedure
The stimuli consisted of a version of the Asahi brightness illusion (Kitaoka, 2005), since
earlier studies have found this to be a powerful illusory stimulus, as documented by the
profile of perceptual responses or psychophysics as well as the physiological response of
pupillary constriction (see Laeng & Endestad, 2012). As done in the previous
investigations, responses to the brightness illusion were compared with those to a control
picture (Figure 1) in which the illusory-inducing gradients diverge so as to disrupt, in fact
reverse, the brightness illusory effect so that the central area appears relatively darker than
the background in the control stimulus. In the pupillometry experiment, the brightness
illusion and its darker control were shown in isolation for 4 s, and three colored patterns
(yellow, purple, or green) were presented during the test, with size varying between 6 and 10
of visual angle, resulting in a total of six pseudorandomized trials intermixed to filler images
of other geometrical patterns (e.g., checkerboard-like patterns). Participants were instructed
to maintain fixation on the central cross throughout all trials and did not give any explicit
responses to the stimuli.
The participants also completed a task where the three illusory patterns were shown
pairwise and side by side (twice by positioning the ``bright'' pattern to the left and to the
right of the ``dark in each trial).'' The participants reported verbally which of the two patterns
looked brighter in its center.
SMI (SensoMotoric Instruments, Berlin, Germany) software (iView 3.2Õ Experiment
Center) was used for presenting all experimental stimuli on a Dell P2213 VGA LCD 18.500
monitor with display resolution set to 1,680 Â 1,050 pixels. Participants seated with their eyes
55 cm from the screen and they responded verbally to the experimenter who registered the
responses in the computer.
In the pupillometry experiment with the bright illusion, after a simple 4-point calibration
procedure, the eye-tracker sampled eye positions at a rate of 60 Hz using a SMI RED500
remote eye-tracking device by SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI, Germany). Right before the
presentation of each pattern stimulus, isoluminant blank images appeared for 1,000 ms. Pupil
responses (in mm) to each baseline were subtracted from the corresponding pupil response to
a pattern so as to obtain the main dependent variable of ``pupillary change.'' During the task,
participants maintained fixation on a little dot at the center of each pattern without making
any verbal or manual response.
Results
All measures of pupil size in a same individual and to the bright and dark stimuli, from onset
until the offset of the stimulus (4,000 ms), were averaged to obtain a mean pupillary change.
These were first analyzed in a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Group
(ASD vs. Controls) and Illusion (bright vs. dark) as the between-subject and within-subject
factors. Contrary to the prediction that the effect of brightness illusions on pupil sizes would
be weaker or absent in the ASD group than the control group, there was no indication of a
differential pupillary change when looking at the illusory bright versus dark stimuli. As
expected and shown in Figure 2, pupils did constrict to the bright illusions, F(1, 33) ¼ 17.8,
p ¼ .0002. This finding replicates the presence of a pupillary reduction to bright illusions
previously reported by Laeng and Endestad (2012).
There were, however, neither a main effect of Group, F(1, 33) ¼ 0.87, p ¼ .77, nor an
interactive effect of Illusion and Group, F(1, 33) ¼ 0.24, p ¼ .63. The effect sizes of the
responses of the ASD group and Control group to the ``bright'' or the ``dark'' patterns
Laeng et al. 5
appeared to be similar (bright: Cohen's d ¼ 0.0; dark: Cohen's d ¼ 0.179). When exploring the
illusory effects in the two groups with separate ANOVAs, there was a strong effect size of the
Illusion in both the Control group (Cohen's d ¼ 0.813; Lambda ¼ 17.8; Power ¼ .99) and the
ASD group (Cohen's d ¼ 0.779; Lambda ¼ 7.5; Power ¼ .70). Figure 3 illustrates the pupillary
change evolution in each group for the ``bright'' and ``dark'' patterns; as the shaded stripes
(i.e., the 95% confidence intervals around the mean) indicate, the graphs reveal a substantial
overlap in pupillary changes over time in the two groups.
In addition, we analyzed the present results with a Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA
using the statistical software JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/). This analysis had Group (ASD
vs. Controls) and Illusion (bright vs. dark) as the between-subject and within-subject factors.
We used as prior a value of 0.2, which is the default for Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA
in JASP. We found that the Group's BF10
¼ 0.363 and the inclusion Bayes Factor (based on

(dark) control pattern (bottom panel) in the ASD group and the CNTRL group. The plots show the density of

matched models) for the Group Â Illusion interaction is 0.391, indicating that the present
results are 2.56 more likely under H0 than under H1. However, the Illusion factor had a
BF10
¼ 653.4, indicating strong evidence for a pupillary difference when viewing stimuli like
the ones in Figure 1.
Consistent with their pupil responses, both groups made similar judgments of relative
brightness, as the (``bright'') pattern was judged as ``brighter'' than the (``dark'') control in
its center by both the individuals with ASD (Mean % choices ¼ 81.7 %; SE ¼ 8.1) and the
controls (Mean % choices ¼ 86.9; SE ¼ 5.9), F(1, 28) ¼ 0.24, p ¼ .63.
A series of regression analyses failed to reveal a predictive role of either participants' age
on either mean % ``brighter'' choices (r ¼ .02, p ¼ .93) or the mean pupil changes to the bright
illusion (r ¼ .09, p ¼ .90). Similarly, scores in the fluid intelligence test (Raven Matrices) failed
to predict mean pupil changes to the bright illusion for either ASD (r ¼ .003, p ¼ .99) or
Control participants (r ¼ .11, p ¼ .68), as well as the participants' mean % ``brighter'' choices
(r ¼ .08, p ¼ .69).
Discussion
This study is the first exploration of pupillary responses to illusory brightness in individuals
with ASD. Based on recent accounts of ``veridical'' perception in this group (e.g., Mottron
et al., 2013; Pellicano & Burr, 2012), it was hypothesized that the ASD group would differ
from the control group by showing an absent or reduced constriction of the pupil to illusory

light as well as a reduced proportion of reports of illusory effects. This prediction was based
on recent accounts of increased reliance on sensory input or reduced reliance on perceptual
hypotheses (or ``hypo-priors'' or ``aberrant precision'' of predictions; Lawson et al., 2014;
Pellicano & Burr, 2012) in individuals with ASD compared to individuals with typical
development.
The present results did not reveal a difference in either perceptual reports or physiological
adjustments to the above patterns. Therefore, this study does not support the hypothesis that
the optical illusion of enhanced brightness or glare differs in the perceptual processing of
individuals with ASD. Such a negative conclusion is consistent with other failures to replicate
a veridical perception of illusions (Manning et al., 2017; Ropar & Mitchell, 1999, 2001). One
should also consider that the physiological evidence collected here would seem immune to
effects of task demands (Rosenthal & Rubin, 1978), since the pupil response cannot be
controlled at will (Laeng & Sulutvedt, 2014) and constitute a ``honest signal'' related to
the experience, whereas responses in the typical tasks can be controlled voluntarily (e.g.,
either responding verbally or when performing adjustments of the perceptual elements, like
in Ropar & Mitchell, 1999, 2001). Thus, based on the present findings, it seems instead that
atypical processing related to visual illusions does not constitute a universal aspect of visual
processing in individuals with ASD and it is not a necessary element for the development of
other difficulties related to ASD (cf., Behrmann et al., 2006). In fact, any single formulation
of cognitive changes in people with ASD may fail to capture the heterogeneity and
multifactorial causality below the phenomena observed (Happe
´ , Ronald, & Plomin, 2006).
Interestingly, a recent study by Blaser, Eglington, Carter, and Kaldy (2014) examined
pupil responses of two groups of toddlers, one with ASD and one with typical
development, during visual search and found that the ASD group had larger dilations
during this attentional task than the control group. The authors suggest that the increased
pupil size of the ASD group was a sign of increased attentional focus, which led this group to
perform better than children with typical development. However, a similar explanation is
unlikely in this study, since passive viewing of visual patterns is not as demanding as visual
search, and the present findings indicate equal constrictions to the brighter illusions and no
sign of an opposite, dilation, pupil response in the ASD group. In addition, recently, Lawson,
Mathys, and Rees (2017) showed that adults with ASD had a reduced dilation response to
surprising outcomes when learning about probabilistic relationships. They interpreted this
finding as resulting from a tendency to overestimate the ``volatility'' of the sensory
environment. In the present context, as suggested in Zavagno et al. (2017), automatic
constrictions to subjective brightness suggest the presence of predictions of forthcoming
``glare'' that prepare the visual system to a probable increase in light energy and the pupil
adjusts its size as a ``protective response'' to anticipated dazzle. These fast pupillary
constrictions to probable blinding sunlight could be evolutionarily selected to reduce its
threat to survival and therefore may not result from an individual's learning about the
volatility of the sensory environment. Finally, Turi, Burr, and Binda (2018) showed that
scores in the Autism Spectrum Quotient (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) in a group of adults
with typical development were related to pupillary changes when reporting the direction of
motion of a bistable rotating object. These changes were interpreted as indicating
adjustments of the focus of visual attention (as in Binda, Pereverzeva, & Murray, 2014;
Matho
^ t & van der Stigchel, 2015) to either the brighter or darker surfaces of the object.
Turi et al.'s results show that traits typical of ASD relate to different ways of focusing
attention and, in turn, affect pupil size. However, Turi et al. did not test participants with
ASD. Nevertheless, on the basis of their study, we surmise that similar deployments of
attention took place in our ASD group and in the adults with typical development when
8 i-Perception 9(3)
viewing the brightness illusions. In general, it seems likely that the glare illusion effect actually
depends on ``predictive processes'' of a different kind than those that affect other illusory
effects (Laeng & Endestad, 2012; Zavagno et al., 2017).
We need to stress that there are several limitations in this study. First of all, it is based on a
small sample of participants with ASD (N ¼ 11) compared to other studies (e.g., N ¼ 25 in
Happe
´ , 1996). However, the study of Ropar and Mitchell (1999, 2001) was based on 36 and
30 individuals with ASD, and these studies also failed to observe differences. In fact, in this
study, we found no hints that the pupil responses of the participants with ASD differed on
average or in their variability to those of the controls, as indicated by the comparable effect
sizes of physiological response of the pupils and the individuals' distribution of pupil change.
The Bayesian analysis leaned toward only ``weak'' if not inconclusive evidence (Dienes, 2014,
or ``anecdotal,'' cf. Jeffreys, 1961) for the null hypothesis, since it found the present results to
be 2.6 times more likely under the null hypothesis than what predicted by a ``veridical
perception'' account of ASD. We also note that this study investigated adults instead of
children, and the perception of illusion is more common in adults than in younger children
(cf. Doherty, Campbell, Tsuji, & Phillips, 2010). Hence, one possible explanation for the
difference in results from Happe
´ (1996) may be that results with children with ASD reflect a
delay rather than a deviance from the typical developmental course. However, the studies by
Ropar and Mitchell (1999, 2001) and Manning et al. (2017), which also did not find
significant differences between ASD and control groups, had younger participants than
this study (mean age around 13 and 10 years, range ¼ 7­18 and 6­14, respectively), and
comparable to Happe
´ (1996; mean age 13, range 8­16). An adult group in Ropar and
Mitchell (1999) did not differ systematically from the other groups. Moreover, we note
that our groups were not optimally matched with regard to fluid intelligence and genders'
proportions, the former being higher in the control group and the proportion of females
lower in the ASD group. However, we do not assume illusory perception to be influenced by
differences in IQ in adults. In younger subjects, it is more likely that a lower susceptibility
might reflect more immature perceptual function, but this would constitute an influence that
would work against the present results. Similarly, there is no known gender difference in
susceptibility to brightness illusions. Finally, this study did not include a measure of severity
of symptoms in the ASD group or of autistic traits in the control group. However, given the
small group of individuals with ASD that we were able to recruit in this study, this
information would not have been likely to reveal significant effects. Future studies, with
larger and better matched samples, should further address more detailed relationships
between symptoms of ASD and the perception of illusory objects.
