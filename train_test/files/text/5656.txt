We expressly do not equate physical systems with psychological
systems, nor do we derive psychological phenomena from
physical phenomena. Instead we juxtapose the phenomenology
of each, the patterns or events in the respective system behaviors.
We stay close to the surface of the respective phenomena and
draw analogies based on how physicists talk about . . .
phenomena. With luck, the analogy can re-present or reconstitute
the psychological phenomenon from a different and we hope
useful point of view.

To the scientist, the universality of physical laws makes the
cosmos a marvelously simple place. By comparison, human
nature--the psychologist's domain--is infinitely more daunting.

Researchers have debated for centuries over the character,
reality, and usefulness of race with the prevailing opinion
that it is a social construct and not real in a biological sense
(McChesney, 2015; Omi & Winant, 2015; Smedley &
Smedley, 2005). Even though race is arguably not tangible or
real, belief in the validity and utility of race has produced an
extended and dynamic history of racial differentiation, iden-
tification, and discrimination (Duncan, 2000; Omi & Winant,
2015; Smedley & Smedley, 2005). As a result, "race essen-
tializes and stereotypes people, their social statuses, their
social behaviors, and their social ranking" (Smedley &
Smedley, 2005, p. 22). However, with multiple indicators of
racial progress, increased variation in racial self-identifica-
tion, and the contradictions of living in an allegedly postra-
cial world, how individuals think of themselves and others as
racial beings is possibly in a more pronounced state of flux
than ever before (Ikuenobe, 2013; Masuoka, 2011; Stevenson
& Wolfers, 2012). Therefore, a modern examination of race
and racial identity development requires frameworks and
perspectives that can account for its dynamic and complex
nature (Brittian, 2012; Dill & Zambrana, 2009). Over the
past few decades, there has been a proliferation of such per-
spectives and frameworks. Among these perspectives are
complexity, chaos, and systems theory. These frameworks
have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of several
different types of race-related phenomena including cross-
cultural communication, culture, cultural identity, ethnic
identity, racial segregation, divergent racial conditions and
outcomes, and adolescent identity development (Brittian,
2012; Chao & Moon, 2005; Menendian & Watt, 2008;
Remer,2007;Schelling,2006;Spencer,Dupree,&Hartmann,

Toward Conceptualizing Race and
Racial Identity Development Within
an Attractor Landscape
Sean C. Hill1
Abstract
Concepts, theories, and findings of race and racial identity development were reviewed and conceptualized into a single
model based on principles of complexity and chaos. This article proposes race can be understood as a complex adaptive
system and conceptualized as an attractor landscape. In this model, trajectories represent racial identity development or
progression through an attractor landscape comprised of racial categories. Although this works well as a conceptual model,
the modeling of racial identity development within an attractor landscape is affected by practical constraints related to data
collection and many of the same limitations of existing racial identity development theories. The proposed model also creates
additional challenges because of its interdisciplinary nature.

Understanding Complex Adaptive
Systems, Attractor Landscapes, and
Attractor Dynamics
Johnson (2009) defined complexity (science) as "the study
of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of inter-
acting objects" (pp. 3-4). Although this is a straightforward
definition, it is more useful to identify the conditions of a
complex system. Page (2011) identified three basic condi-
tions for a system to be considered complex: diversity, inter-
action, and interdependence. Each of these conditions applies
to racial phenomena. Diversity refers to differences within
type, between types, or in reference to composition. Racial
categorization is an example of typing. However, racial cat-
egorization, such as social categorization in general, is
flawed because it is based on perspective and history, plagued
by transcategorical movement, and the act of categorization
itself affects the categories (Gillespie, Howarth, & Cornish,
2012). Race is also sometimes treated as a natural or master
category, which gives it a supervenient quality or projects
essence onto it (Miller & Perino, 2007; Omi & Winant, 2015;
Wagner, Holtz, & Kashima, 2009). Interaction indicates enti-
ties or agents interact within a specific space or network
(e.g., geographic location or shared computer network).
Interdependence means actions taken by one entity affects
other entities. It is in this sense that a racial first by someone
in a racial minority group can alter the perception of indi-
viduals in that racial category; or a single act of discrimina-
tion or defiance can set off a nationwide protest (Torre &
Gagne, 2012; Westcott, 2015). For a system to be considered
as a complex adaptive system, adaptation must occur based
on individuals or types (Page, 2011). Race is adaptive as per-
ceptions of self and what it means to be in a racial category
change over time and space (Masuoka, 2011; Omi & Winant,
2015; Wong, 2002; Zhou, 2004).
Complex relationships and dynamics can be presented
using landscape models (Miller & Page, 2007). In particular,
attractor landscapes have been used to model brain function,
cultural complexity, adolescent development, and schizo-
phrenia (Lichtwarck-Aschoff & van Geert, 2004; Morris,
Whitacre, Ross, & Ulieru, 2011; van Beveren & de Haan,
2008; van Dijk, Kerkhofs, van Rooij, & Haselager, 2008).
Within an attractor landscape,
attractors are often represented topographically as valleys on a
dynamic landscape. The deeper and wider the attractor, the more
likely it is that behavior falls into and remains there, and the
more resistant it is to small changes in the environment. (Granic
& Hollenstein, 2003, pp. 644-645; see Figure 1)
Attractors intrinsically "capture the interplay between struc-
ture and dynamics in a complex system and thus are useful
for framing the tension between stability and change in psy-
chological processes" (Nowak, Vallacher, & Zochowski,
2005, p. 352).
Attractors come in different forms--each possessing dif-
ferent patterns of behavior (Guastello & Liebovitch, 2009;
Thelen & Smith, 2006). There are four types of attractors:
fixed point (or point), limit-cycle (or cyclic or periodic or
oscillating), toroidal (or quasiperiodic), and chaotic (or
strange) (Barton, 1994; Guastello & Liebovitch, 2009; see
Figure 2). As the name indicates, a trajectory is attracted to a
fixed point in a fixed-point attractor. Nowak et al. (2005)
framed fixed-point attractors as the psychological equivalent
of "equilibrium or homeostasis" (p. 354). An individual may
have a repertoire of fixed patterns of behavior that may be
wanted or unwanted, or even contradictory (Nowak et al.,
2005). These patterns invariably become an individual's "go-
to" patterns of thinking and behaving across situations. If an
individual progresses through patterns in regular intervals, this
represents a limit-cycle attractor. In a limit-cycle (or cyclical
or periodic or oscillating) attractor, a trajectory displays cycli-
cal, oscillating, or orbit-like patterns (Guastello & Liebovitch,
2009). The movement of a pendulum is an example of a limit-
cycle. "A toroidal attractor is the result of a limit-cycle that is
cycling along two axes rather than one" (Guastello &
Liebovitch, 2009, p. 11). The name of this attractor comes
from its shape as torus or bagel when shown as a visual model
(Nowak & Lewenstein, 1994). Psychologically, this represents
irregular oscillation between different goals, states, or atti-
tudes (Nowak & Lewenstein, 1994). Toroidal attractors can
develop because of bifurcations, which are unstable patterns
observed before a system changes (Nowak & Lewenstein,
1994). The significance of bifurcations is they can push a sys-
tem into chaos when they develop in succession (Guastello &
Liebovitch, 2009). These peculiar characteristics are why
toroidal attractors are sometimes mistaken for chaotic attrac-
tors (Guastello & Liebovitch, 2009). The most familiar attrac-
tor may be the chaotic or strange attractor (Mackenzie, 2005).
A physics-based definition of a strange attractor is "a stable,
nonperiodic state or behavior exhibited by some dynamic sys-
tems, especially turbulent ones, that can be represented as a

nonrepeating pattern in the system's phase space" (Strange
Attractor, n.d.). A chaotic attractor describes attitudes or
behavior that are within limits but become unpredictable and
irregular over time because of differences in initial conditions,
errors in measurement, and constant changes in the system
(Barton, 1994; Duke, 1994).
Transformations known as phase transitions occur
because of altered parameters within attractors and attractor
landscapes (Granic & Hollenstein, 2003; Hollenstein, 2007;
Ott, 2002). These transitions, which are varyingly referred to
as crises, catastrophes, or bifurcations based on particular
dynamics, result in changes to the shape, size, location, or
type of an attractor (Hollenstein, 2007). Transitions can also
lead to the creation, destruction, merging, or splitting of an
attractor (Hardy, 1998; Ott, 2002). During a (phase) transi-
tion, systems are especially sensitive to perturbation as the
trajectory may move to a different area within an attractor or
to a different attractor (Granic & Hollenstein, 2003). After a
period of crisis or transition, a system may display even
deeper level erratic behavior, known as intermittencies or
transients. During this time, trajectories switch between new
and old regions before settling into the new region or a toroi-
dal attractor may temporarily appear (Grebogi, Ott, & Yorke,
1983; Guastello & Liebovitch, 2009; Ott, 2002).
The author proposes racial identity development theories
can be reframed using the properties and dynamics of chaotic
attractors. Although these theories are employed within
social, developmental, and counseling psychology, this arti-
cle primarily utilizes theories from counseling psychology
(Ponterotto & Park-Taylor, 2007). Racial identity develop-
ment theories are valued in counseling psychology because
they acknowledge the influence of racism on identity devel-
opment and serve as diagnostic tools during counseling (Sue
& Sue, 2013). Their theoretical focus on stages/statuses as an
individual progresses through the complexities of racial
identification parallels the various states observed as trajec-
tories move through attractors in a complex system. On a
macro level, racism acts as the ideological foundation of this
complex system through the institutionalization of racial dif-
ference (Markus, 2008). This process of institutionalization,
including the creation of racial attractors, occurs through
several different mechanisms. Although Nowak et al. (2005)
primarily focused on interpersonal synchronization and self-
organization as forces in shaping personality, they clarified
these forces
are [not] the only means by which experience engraves attractors
in people's cognitive-affective systems. Theory and research in
personality science have identified a host of other plausible
mechanisms of personality development and maintenance,
including direct reinforcement, social learning and modeling,
labeling and self-fulfilling prophecies, identification, and guilt
induction. (p. 379)
Each of these mechanisms aligns with Markus's (2008) con-
ceptualization of race as a social and relational process; and
contributes to the persistence of racial differences even as
actions or events occur that run counter to the system.
In applying the language of attractors to racial identity
development, unique trajectories (i.e., racial identity) in the
perceived attractor basins (i.e., racial categories) represent
how an individual traverses the various characteristics,
behaviors, attitudes, and preferences associated with a given
racial category or categories in correspondence with situa-
tional and identity variables. Transitions in the proposed
model result from changes in self-perception, environmental
cues, and/or the perceived constitution of at least one racial
category (and possibly the entire system). These transitions
then cause instability and variability in an individual's per-
ceived fit and trajectory within a racial category (or catego-
ries). Consistent with this conceptualization, the autopoietic
nature of complex systems, and the prescriptive nature of
racial­ethnic self-schemas, identity is not something that we
hold or have, but more accurately something we continually
perceive, reify, and modify through our behaviors in coordi-
nation with the environment (Luhmann, 1995; Markus &
Wurf, 1987; Markus, 2008; Oyserman, 2008). This also cor-
responds with agent fitness as a theme of complex adaptive
systems (Dooley, 1997; Guastello, 2009). Guastello (2009)
labeled agent fitness as "not the same as a performance rat-
ing, but something closer to a person-job fit" (p. 407). Race
is related to agent fitness as one's name, appearance, behav-
iors, thoughts, location, status, and skill set affect how an
individual identifies with, and is perceived to be a member
of, a particular racial group (AhnAllen, Suyemoto, & Carter,
2006; Ben-Zeev, Dennehy, Goodrich, Kolarik, & Geisler,

tural mosaic.) Spencer and Markstrom-Adams's (1990) view

ceptual framework for interpreting the ongoing experience
or `fit' between self and the environment" (p. 292).
Reframing Existing Theories and
Constructs of Race and Racial Identity
Development With an Attractor
Landscape
Cross (1971) developed one of the earliest theories of racial
identity development to describe the developmental patterns
of African Americans. Since the publication of Cross's the-
ory, similar stage- and status-based models were developed
to describe the identity development of individuals in other
racial groups and social categories--with the newer theories
being more explicitly ecological and nonlinear (Hardiman &
Jackson, 1992, 1997; Helms, 1990, 1995, 1996; Jackson,
1976; Kim, 2012; Parham, 1989; Poston, 1990; Renn, 2000,
2003; Rockquemore & Brunsma, 2002; Root, 1990, 1996;
Sodowsky, 1996; Sue & Sue, 2013). The ecological nature of
these theories position them as qualitatively close to chaotic
as imbalances of positive and negative feedback can push an
ecological system into chaos (Berryman & Millstein, 1989).
In a complex system based on racism, feedback comes in the
form of behaviors and attitudes that support or contradict
racism, such as racial socialization and racial discrimination
(Buckley, 1998; Hunter & Lewis-Coles, 2004; Menendian &
Watt, 2008; Myrdal, 1944; Spencer et al., 1997). The pro-
posed model also aligns with other theories that focus on the
dynamic, historical, recurring, social, situated, and restrain-
ing aspects of racial identity (see Cross, 2012; Omi & Winant,
2015; Root, 2002; Spencer et al., 1997; Verkuyten, 2016;
Wijeyesinghe, 2012). Most notably, the metaphysical essence
and language of attractors is seemingly imbued within Omi
and Winant's (2015) definition of racial formation as "the
sociohistorical process by which racial categories are cre-
ated, lived out, transformed, and destroyed" (p. 109).
Racial identity development theories exhibit patterns that
correspond with the framing of development as a progres-
sion of states within a complex system (Smith & Thelen,
2003; Thelen & Smith, 2006). In addition, transitions within
these theories parallel dynamics displayed by attractors in
crisis or transition (van Geert, 2009). This includes the gen-
eral stage-related trends found in the racial identity develop-
ment theories cited in the preceding paragraph: preawareness
or preattraction to a racial identity, attraction toward a major-
ity identity, attraction toward a minority identity, fluctuating
periods of attraction to majority and minority identities,
development of a new identity, rejection (or destruction) of a
racial identity, merging of racial identities, and a dynamic
pattern that switches between all of the above identities.
Similar to connections and comparisons that are noted with
Chao and Moon's (2005) cultural mosaic, these patterns and
trends account for statuses described in Phinney's (1989)
stages of ethnic identity development; Sodowsky, Kwan, and
Pannu's (1995) four ethnic identity orientations; and Roccas
and Brewer's (2002) models of multiple in-group representa-
tion. (The proposed model shares commonalities with Chao
& Moon's, 2005, cultural mosaic. Both have an explicit
focus and usage of concepts in complexity and chaos.
However, the model proposed here utilizes a deeper theoreti-
cal examination and application of attractor types and prop-
erties, a more narrow focus on race, and increased integration
with theories, concepts, and research on racial identity devel-
opment. In addition, the cultural mosaic frames attractors as
tiles, which relate to different aspects of identity.)
An understanding of the properties of chaotic attractors
and complex adaptive systems also elucidates paradoxical
views on the cyclical and nonlinear nature of racial identity
development. Racial identity development theories describe
moving into deeper or less explored facets of racial categories
over the course of an individual's lifetime (Cross & Fhagen-
Smith, 2001; Parham, 1989). This combined dynamic of
oscillating between categories and moving more deeply into
them over time is reminiscent of the Lorenz attractor with its
lemniscate shape and entrancing pattern between two basins
of attraction (Lorenz, 1963; see Figure 2D). Wing and Rifkin
(2001) intuitively perceived and captured this dynamic in
attractor-like detail in their discussion of Hardiman and
Jackson's (1997) social identity development theory. They
proposed the theory can be viewed as
a series of different lenses through which people may view the
world. A person may tend to use a lens reflecting a particular
stage and after a time may use the next lens in the developmental
sequence most frequently. And while people may move from
one stage to another in what appears to be a linear fashion, as
they experience further oppression or develop a deeper
understanding of oppression and/or identity, they may instead
move more deeply into what would appear to be an "earlier"
stage. In effect, we can see this model as a spiral of movement,
like the peeling of an onion, rather than a solely linear process.
An example of this might occur when a person moves more
deeply into an "earlier" stage after experiencing identity-related
violence. (Wing & Rifkin, 2001, p. 185, quotations in original)
A similar property is found in complex adaptive systems.
Dooley (1997) identified irreversibility as one of the key
principles of complex adaptive systems. As described by
Guastello (2009), even if previous states or conditions are
reestablished, "the effect is not the same because of the
Hill 5
history that accumulated, events that occurred, and time that
has elapsed" (p. 406). In combination, these properties inval-
idate theoretical perspectives that support the absolute (re)
cycling of attitudes or linear progression of racial identity
development. These properties are also why normal racial
identity development should be described as chaotic. A racial
identity that progresses like a fixed, limit-cycle, or toroidal
attractor could be considered pathological, indicative of
identity stagnation, or evidence of deeply entrenched and
cyclical racial dynamics (Blackman, 2005; Parham, 1989;
Wachtel, 2014). Individuals should display some degree of
identity complexity and variability over time and in different
situations. (Reluctance to frame development as chaotic is in
part because of the conflation of the colloquial understand-
ing of chaos with the scientific meaning of the term. Carver
and Scheier, 1999, stated, "using words such as turbulence,
static, or chaos . . . is in a way very misleading. These peri-
ods may not feel subjectively like turbulence at all because
their occurrence is quite familiar. The chaos may feel instead
like `implicit decision making,'" p. 71, italics and quotations
in original). Framing racial identity development within cha-
otic attractors also accounts for Cross's (2012) belief that
"what changes, from situation to situation, is not identity but
the manner in which identity is expressed" (p. 194; see also
Helms, 1996). Accordingly, a core racial identity would pro-
vide some predictability and stability, whereas the expres-
sion of the identity may be somewhat unpredictable based on
incomplete information, interaction effects, and situational
variables.
Reinforcement, perturbation, stabilization, and reconfigu-
ration of racial identity (i.e., trajectories) and racial catego-
ries (i.e., attractors) are rooted in exposure to different types
of racially associated phenomena or events. Among these
phenomena are racial socialization, racial discrimination,
racial firsts (or something that is considered atypical for
someone in a particular racial group), racial realizations, and
racially tinged environments, or anything that is perceived as
a threat to one's racial identity (Branscombe, Ellemers,
Spears, & Doosje, 1999; Helms, 1995; Hogg & Hornsey,
2006; Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2012; Spencer et al., 1997; Wing
& Rifkin, 2001). In addition, each of these phenomena inter-
acts with the others and generates feedback loops resulting in
nonlinear, correlational, or moderating effects. For example,
there are different outcomes based on the types of racial
socialization messages that are received and the identity of
the individual when racial discrimination is experienced.
Variance in these factors contributed to differences in the
perception and effects of racial discrimination, identity out-
comes, and the psychological tools an individual has to cope
with racial discrimination (Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey,
1999; Harrell, 2000; Helms, 1995; Herman, 2004; Lee &
Ahn, 2013; Sellers & Shelton, 2003; Stevenson & Arrington,
2009; Yip, Gee, & Takeuchi, 2008). The power of feedback
is also apparent via reactions to behaviors that introduce nov-
elty into the system, such as counterstereotypical or
unexpected behavior (Holland, 1995). Individuals may
become uncomfortable attempting or even observing actions
or behaviors that are not typically associated with individu-
als of a given racial background. Reactions to these "inap-
propriate" actions included racial discrimination, threat
responses, and stereotypical behaviors (Mendes, Blascovich,
Hunter, Lickel, & Jost, 2007; Phelan & Rudman, 2010). To
further complicate the understanding of the interrelatedness
of race-related phenomena, it should be noted that the dis-
tinction between stabilization and perturbation may be
imprecise. Although racial discrimination experiences would
typically be thought of as incidents that only perturb identity
toward a different state, both microaggressions and some
racial socialization messages could be viewed as "tiny per-
turbations . . . to stabilize regular dynamics behaviours and to
direct chaotic trajectories rapidly to a desired state" (Shinbrot,
Grebogi, Ott, & Yorke, 1993, p. 411). This is insofar as the
intention of both phenomena (at least from the perspective of
the agent or system) may be to reinforce a racial status quo or
way of thinking (Hughes et al., 2006; Sue et al., 2007).
Stabilization and moderation of racial identity also occurs
through coping or buffering strategies to counter the effects
of perspective-shifting stimuli or to (re-)establish a sense of
order among racial categories (e.g., Blanz, Mummendey,
Mielke, & Klink, 1998; Brondolo, Brady, Pencille, Beatty, &
Contrada, 2009; Cross, 2012; Helms, 1995).
Other dynamics and trends are also supported. In most
racial identity development theories, an individual displays
an initial preference toward the dominant racial category
regardless of race (after the development of some awareness
and understanding of race). However, an initial preference
could be focused on a nondominant racial category depend-
ing on the degree of exposure to the dominant racial category
and an individual's immediate environmental racial influ-
ences. Either situation is consistent with Granic and
Hollenstein's (2003) claim that "contextual constraints prob-
abilistically guide behavior toward the dominant attractor at
any given moment in time" (p. 645). A single attractor may
separate in multiple attractors. For example, there are differ-
ing views and mental representations of the terms Black and
African American (Hall, Phillips, & Townsend, 2015;
Larkey, Hecht, & Martin, 1993; Philogène, 2004). The dis-
covery of latent attractors (e.g., discovery of racial categories
or options that were not noticed by an individual) is an alter-
nate explanation for new categories (Vallacher & Nowak,
2009). In many cases, so-called "new" attractors or catego-
ries are not newly created but simply newly discovered. For
example, a biracial identity may not have been perceived as
an option in an individual's home neighborhood, but becomes
a new option when exposed to other individuals in a college
setting who identify as biracial (Renn, 2000). Changing from
being drawn to a category to being repelled by it (i.e., effec-
tively changing from an attractor to a repeller) is supported
in theory and research, and applies to race (Cross & Fhagen-
Smith, 2001; Renn, 2000, 2003; Vallacher & Nowak, 2009).
6 SAGE Open
Way, Hernández, Rogers, and Hughes (2013) found minority
adolescents used racial stereotypes as both guides for behav-
iors to follow and avoid. An attractor-based model also sup-
ports multistabilities and multiple simultaneous crises
(Nowak et al., 2005). Individuals can display concurrent
attraction to multiple racial categories or experience multiple
racial crises (Chao & Moon, 2005; Helms, 1995; Oyserman,
2008; Poston, 1990; Renn, 2000, 2003; Root, 1990, 1996;
Sanchez, Shih, & Garcia, 2009). This multiplicity extends to
feedback. Because of simultaneous attraction and crisis, con-
flicting positions within identities, and competing situational
cues, there is bipolar feedback. Sabelli (2005) referred to
bipolar feedback as coexisting negative and positive feed-
back, which results in "synergistic and antagonistic interac-
tion" (p. vi). The combination of multiplicities forms a
theoretical foundation for the psychological equivalent of
intermittencies and transients, as an individual who is the
victim of racial discrimination and/or develops race-related
cognitive dissonance may experience psychological distress
or a crisis of racial identity (Lee & Ahn, 2013; Rowe,
Bennett, & Atkinson, 1994; Yip et al., 2008). This uncom-
fortable state then contributes to increased sensitivity to
bipolar feedback and, ultimately, deeper level erratic think-
ing and behavior (see Grebogi et al., 1983; Ott, 2002). These
multiplicities, along with uncertainties about the strength,
relationships, and directionalities of these racially associated
variables, are why the author believes the proposed model
can alternatively be described as an interaction-dominant
dynamical system (IDDS). In an IDDS, "mutual and recipro-
cal interactions . . . constitute a complex system of multidi-

Discussion
As an exercise in interdisciplinary research, the proposed
model is an attempt to provide consilience to disparate theo-
ries and concepts of race and racial identity development,
and to connect these theories to deeper level and more uni-
versal scientific principles. Although interdisciplinary
research can be valuable, the author acknowledges this type
of research poses a unique set of challenges including the
possibility of theoretical misunderstandings, problematic
syntheses, insignificant gains, and the need for shifts in
thinking (Pedersen, 2016). In addition, there are conflicting
positions on the metaphorical, analogical, and practical
usage of complexity, chaos, and attractors (Ayers, 1997;
Carver & Scheier, 1999; Mackenzie, 2005; Sawyer, 2005;
Vallacher & Nowak, 2007). Notwithstanding, the author
believes this conceptualization of a unified understanding of
race and racial identity development is in agreement with
Van Orden, Kello, and Holden's (2010) sentiment shared in
the first epigraph.
Racial identification is only part of an individual's identity
and experiences, so it can be said that the proposed conceptual-
ization is too simplistic. In addition, as identity is continuous
and dynamic, an identity status (or stage) is a simplified
description of an attractor state at a discrete moment (Brittian,
2012; Hollenstein, 2007; van Geert, 2009). The author under-
stands there is an incomprehensibly high level of complexity to
the human and social experience. The author also understands
there are many places where language, ethnicity, and national-
ity are the primary means of categorizing people instead of race
(Nsamenang, 2013; Okonofua, 2013). However, when situa-
tions relate to racial identity, race becomes a more important
part of one's identity, which justifies the existence of this and
other theories that focus primarily on race (Benjamin, Choi, &
Strickland, 2010; Shelton & Sellers, 2000).
In addition to the disagreements on the relative impor-
tance of race, there are competing definitions and constructs
of race and ethnicity (Casas, 1984; Cokley, 2005; Cook &
Helms, 1988; Helms & Talleyrand, 1997; Phinney, 1996;
Ponterotto & Park-Taylor, 2007; Umaña-Taylor et al., 2014).
Helms and Talleyrand (1997) argued individuals receive dif-
ferential treatment based on physical appearance not culture.
Alternately, Phinney (1996) believed race is the less clear
concept because of a lack of consensus on usage and mean-
ing, and that ethnicity includes race. Some researchers have
proposed these concepts should be combined (especially
when describing non-White groups) because of the conver-
gence of race and ethnicity in lived experience (Casas, 1984;
Cook & Helms, 1988; Umaña-Taylor et al., 2014). The com-
bined terms include racial/ethnic minority, ethnic and racial
identity (ERI), and visible racial/ethnic group (VREG). (The
author acknowledges it may be more accurate to use the
terms race/ethnicity and ethnic/racial identity development
throughout this article based on these perspectives.) There
are also differing views on whether racial identity is primar-
ily driven by interracial or intraracial experiences (Chávez &
Guido-DiBrito, 1999; Quintana, 2007). These dilemmas are
compounded by a collection of measures that focus on differ-
ent aspects of racial and ethnic identity (Cokley, 2007, 2005;
Helms, 2007; Ponterotto & Park-Taylor, 2007). Identity mea-
sures generally focus on processes that contribute to identity
development (e.g., attitudes about different racial groups and
one's relative place in them), the contents or characteristics
of a developed identity (e.g., views on the importance of
race), or both (Schwartz et al., 2014). These narrowly defined
perspectives of racial identity are then used to infer an indi-
vidual's identity status. The measurement of racial identity is
further obfuscated by an overreliance on survey data, limited
and conflicting views of self and others, cross-cultural
differences, the underreporting of racial information, reluc-
tance to self-categorize, and social desirability effects
(Abrams & Trusty, 2004; Burrell, Winston, & Freeman,
2013; Cokley, 2007; Delgado-Romero, Galván, Maschino, &
Rowland, 2005; Helms, 1996; Jones, Torres, & Arminio,
2006; Townsend, Markus, & Bergsieker, 2009).
Hill 7
The proposed model could move us closer to modeling
and predicting racial identity patterns and development,
and understanding which types of situations can lead to
identity variability and crisis--even though the complete
prediction of thoughts and behavior will remain out of
reach. The paradox is summed up in Edward Lorenz's defi-
nition of chaos (as cited in Danforth, 2013): "when the
present determines the future, but the approximate present
does not approximately determine the future." This para-
dox, along with the questionable validity and ambivalence
of categories such as race, is why racial identity develop-
ment theories and virtually any effort to reduce individuals
to racial categories is of somewhat limited use and will dis-
play weak statistical power (Carter & Fenton, 2009;
Markus, 2008). Although there are statistical measures spe-
cifically designed for analyzing systems influenced by non-
linear and attractor dynamics (e.g., Brittian, 2012; Granic
& Hollenstein, 2003; Guastello & Gregson, 2010), one of
the initial challenges of modeling racial identity as attractor
states involves determining the best choices among various
race-related constructs and measures (and possibly frag-
menting them into subcategories for optimal coding). The
next harrowing task is deciding on (and fulfilling) the nec-
essary frequency, conditions, and methods of measurement
to accurately portray the multiplicity of states exhibited
across situations and timescales (Ayers, 1997; Carter, 1996;
Fogel, 2011). Put simply, if racial identity is truly continu-
ous, dynamic, situational, and often subtle, identity param-
eters should be measured continuously to understand racial
identity fully and completely--especially as memory is fal-
lible and biased toward confirmatory information (Brittian,
2012; Cokley, 2007; Gushue & Carter, 2000; Quintana,
2007). As this deconstruction extends to the proposed
model, an attractor landscape model of race and racial iden-
tity development likely demonstrates the same limitations
as the theories it attempts to build on and unify because of
shared epistemological and ontological constraints, which
also affect the examination of culture and ethnicity
(Betancourt & López, 1993; Cauce, 2011; Gone, 2011).
This is complicated by the difficulties associated with
understanding and analyzing the macro­micro reality and
intersubjectivity of social phenomena such as race or eth-
nicity (see Gillespie & Cornish, 2010; Jaspal & Cinnirella,
2012; Morçöl, 2012; Sawyer, 2005; Törrönen, 2014). Even
newer research techniques, such as agent-based modeling,
are insufficient for gaining a complete understanding of
complex racial dynamics because of innumerous percep-
tions and countless interactions among personal character-
istics and the environment (Abdelal, Herrera, Johnston, &
McDermott, 2006; Bednar & Page, 2007; Harrell, 2000;
Smaldino, Pickett, Sherman, & Schank, 2012; Spencer et
al., 1997). These difficulties and limitations collectively
lend credence to Tyson's (2017) aphorism in the second
epigraph. Therefore, this model may, at best, be described
as only a conceptual model that uses the laws of physics
and nonlinear dynamics as a metaphor for the structure and
process of race and racial identity development.
There is also some uncertainty on what would be consid-
ered an optimal racial identity dynamic. Low levels of self-
complexity may be problematic because of excessive rigidity,
and high levels of self-complexity may reflect disorder
(Guastello, 2015). As noted earlier, a fixed or rigid racial
identity may be pathological or stagnant as one's internal
positions should demonstrate flexibility (Blackman, 2005;
Parham, 1989). Conversely, although many racial identity
theories present a dynamic identity as an optimal outcome,
Sanchez et al. (2009) found malleable racial identity was
associated with decreased psychological health and well-
being in multiracial individuals. Research should be com-
pleted to more clearly understand to what extent and how a
dynamic identity is healthy and should be internally or exter-
nally controlled, and to what extent and in what types of situ-
ations a fixed racial identity is a sign of strength versus being
maladaptive or a possible indication of psychopathology.
Future research could frame other identity categories,
such as gender, sexuality, class, and sexual orientation, as
attractor landscapes based on dynamics, rationales, and con-
structs similar to those identified in this article. However,
this research enterprise raises the same issues identified with
the modeling and measuring of racial identity across states
and timescales. The final research goal then becomes model-
ing interactions between these various identity landscapes.
Possible guides to this synthesis include theoretical models
informed by ecological, intersectional, cross-disciplinary,
and complex systems approaches to social identities (e.g.,
Abes, Jones, & McEwen, 2007; Chao & Moon, 2005;
Holvino, 2012; Kertész, Török, Muraze, Jo, & Kaski, 2016;
McCall, 2005; Walby, 2007; Winker & Degele, 2011).
Finally, game theory, like chaos and complexity, has also
unified and explained diverse fields (Gintis, 2009; Guastello,
2009; Varoufakis, 2008). This included examining segrega-
tion based on social identity (Rubí-Barceló, 2013).
Combining game theory, chaos, and complexity provides a
potentially powerful statistical means of modeling and ana-
lyzing social phenomena. Significant progress has been
made toward theoretical unification of these perspectives by
Akiyama and Kaneko (2000, 2002) in a framework they call
dynamical systems game theory. Within dynamical systems
game theory, as is the case with race, "the game itself can
change due to the influence of players' behaviors and states"
(Akiyama & Kaneko, 2000, p. 221). Other approaches to
game theory are also possible. Greenberg's (1990) theory of
social situations is a game-theoretic approach that frames
individuals in a social environment where they understand
recommended behaviors, choose what is perceived to be the
best action, and consider the consequences. Similarly, in a
game-theoretic framework proposed by Bednar and Page
(2007), culture emerges through an ensemble of games
played by agents. Although it is impossible to determine
every conceivable action, it may be reasonable to model

Author Biography
Sean C. Hill is vice president of Student Engagement at Lewis &
Clark Community College, where he also holds tenured faculty sta-
tus in psychology. He received his PhD from Loyola University
Chicago in research methodology/human development. His research
interest is best described as the theoretical unification of the mélange
of social, psychological, and scientific concepts and theories floating
around in his head, which often focuses on race, identity, chaos,
complexity, physics, and Jungian perspectives. He especially enjoys
applying these frameworks to films and anime.
