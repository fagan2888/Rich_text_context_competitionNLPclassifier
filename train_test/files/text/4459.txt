Introduction
Relationship Conflicts
Conflict is a natural aspect of most ongoing close relation-
ships, probably due to the high value placed on individual-
ism (Olson & Defrain, 2001). Conflict occurs between
people in all kinds of human relationships and in all social
settings. Because any aspect of living or working together
contains the seed of situational conflict, relationship con-
flicts can occur between family members, friends, and staff
in an organization (Tizard, Blatchford, & Burke, 2000).
Conflict inherently involves some struggle, incompatibility,
or perceived differences in values, goals, or desires; charac-
teristics, beliefs, and lifestyles; and power of influence and
action between two or more parties in a relationship, com-
bined with attempts to control each other and antagonistic
feelings toward each other (Hart, 2002; Ivancevich &
Matteson, 2002; McShane & Von Glinow, 2000; Meeks,
Heit, & Page, 2005). The incompatibility or difference may
exist in reality or may only be perceived by the parties
involved. Nonetheless, opposing actions and hostile emo-
tions are very real hallmarks of human conflict (Deutsch &
Coleman, 2000). This happens because people's values and
needs have been shaped by different socialization processes
that depend on differing cultural and family traditions, levels
of education, breadths of experience, and lifestyles, which
make individuals see the world differently (Ivancevich &
Matteson, 2002).

Conflict Prevalence in Primary School and
How It Is Understood to Affect Teaching
and Learning in Ghana
Nana Afia Amponsaa Opoku-Asare1, Harriet Takyi1,
and Margaret Owusu-Mensah2
Abstract
Verbal and non-verbal interactions that occur daily between teachers and headteachers, teachers and pupils, and among
pupils can generate conflict that may adversely affect teaching, learning, and schooling effectiveness. Little attention is,
however, paid to the quality of relationships that exists between teachers and pupils, among teachers, among pupils, between
teachers and their school heads, and between schools and their local communities. This study sought to investigate conflict
prevalence in Ghana's primary schools, and how relationship conflict is understood to affect teaching and learning at the level
of headteachers as administrators, teachers as classroom managers, and pupils as learners, and direct beneficiaries of primary
education. Using data gathered via interview, questionnaire administration, and observation in 30 public primary schools in
10 circuits of one district of Ashanti Region, the findings revealed a high prevalence of fighting, heckling, bullying, and other
forms of relationship conflict among pupils; strained teacher­pupil relations due to insolence, indiscipline, and use of offensive
language; and teacher­parent arguments and quarrels due to harsh punishment and verbal assault of pupils. Teacher­pupil
conflicts may extend to teachers excluding the affected pupils from teaching and learning activities, denying them the rights to
ask and answer questions, and have their class exercises marked, leading to lowered pupil self-esteem, reduced concentration
during lessons, and passive involvement in learning activities, which could result in truancy and school dropout. Strengthening
guidance mechanisms and encouraging peer mediation could significantly curb conflict in school environments and thereby
raise educational standards in the district.

Individual differences add pleasure and richness to life,
but they can also create conflict (Covey, 2002). Disagreement
between people or choices can arise whenever the perceived
interests of an individual or a group clash with those of
another individual or a group in such a way that strong emo-
tions are aroused and compromise is not considered to be an
option (Meeks et al., 2005). Similarly, power can also gener-
ate conflict where an individual or a group tries to influence
or exert power to get another person or group to agree with an
entrenched position (L. Larson & Mildred, 2002). Conflict
may not only take a toll on the physical body but it often
occupies the mind and causes a great deal of emotional stress;
conflict behavior does not only affect those involved, but it
may even extend to those who have no part in it (Hart, 2002).
Conflict also has the potential for either a great deal of
destruction or much creativity and positive social change, and
for positive change and innovation (Owens, 2001; Robbins,
2000). It is essential therefore to understand the basic pro-
cesses of conflict so that we can work to maximize productive
outcomes and minimize destructive ones (Kriesberg, 1998, as
cited in Lòpez Fernández-Cao et al., 2010).
Conflict and Education
Conflict in the school environment can have adverse effects
on the academic environment, including affecting the morale
of educators, the pace at which they work, and increasing
absenteeism (Jennings & Wattam, 2004). Unless colleagues
understand personal differences and accept each other's
point of view, needs, priorities, and approach to work and
problem solving (Robbins, 2000), conflict will occur. In
schools, conflict usually occurs between headteachers and
teachers, teachers and teachers, teachers and pupils, teachers
and parents, pupils and pupils, and schools and their com-
munity (Siann & Ugwuegbu, 2000; Whetten & Cameron,
2005). The quality of relationships between teachers and
their pupils is critical because it affects how well a student
adjusts in the school environment (Pianta & Stuhlman,
2004). This notion is emphasized by the finding that children
who experience teacher­student relationships with conflict
in first grade demonstrated lower achievement in mathemat-
ics over the following 2 years (Buyse, Verschueren,
Verachtert, & Van Damme, 2009, as cited in R. Larson,
2012). Good interpersonal relationships in the school situa-
tion, which include how well teachers relate with pupils, how
teachers relate with each other, how the school relates to the
pupils'parents or guardians and to the community as a whole,
are recommended (Kyriacou, 1999) because they promote
effective teaching, learning, and school administration
(R. Larson, 2012).
Method
This study adopted a combination of qualitative and quanti-
tative research methods (Leedy & Ormrod, 2005) with
interview, observation, and questionnaire administration to
investigate conflict behavior in 30 public primary schools
located in 10 different educational circuits in one district of
Ashanti Region, Ghana. The focus was on how interpersonal
conflict is understood at the level of headteachers as admin-
istrators, teachers as classroom managers, and pupils as
learners and direct beneficiaries of primary education, and
perceived to affect teaching and learning. Data were sought
from the 30 headteachers (19 men, 11 women) of the schools,
120 teachers (54 men, 66 women), and 130 pupils (73 girls,
57 boys) across the 30 schools. The pupils were randomly
selected from the six class levels with the assistance of the
class teachers (Basic 1 and 2 = 5, Basic 3 and 4 = 12, Basic 5
and 6 = 113). Personal interviews were held with the 30
headteachers because only three (or 10%) of them returned
the questionnaire that was initially administered. Observation
of classroom and playground activities by the authors also
provided additional data for the study. The interviews, ques-
tionnaire administration, and observation were done concur-
rently over 52 school days.
Focus-group interviewing was adopted with the 130 pupils
because while negotiating access to the schools, it was real-
ized that many of the pupils could neither read nor understand
spoken English well. As a cost-effective way of investigating
the underlying meanings that inform the perceptions of peo-
ple about certain issues (Robinson, 1999), focus-group inter-
viewing in Twi, the local language, provided opportunity for
the pupils to articulate their experiences of conflicts. The
pupils' language deficiency confirms Sellers's (2007) finding
that, in practice, teachers in some areas of Ghana use the local
language in instruction because pupils at primary school are
not proficient enough in the English language. Adopting Twi
in this face-to-face verbal communication with the pupils
responds to the call for social researchers to pay attention to
local languages to get to valuable data from the large number
of illiterates in sub-Saharan Africa (King'ei, 2006).
A 15-item questionnaire comprising both open- and
closed-ended questions meant to access the strengths in each
form of method (Reja, Manfreda, Hlebec, & Vehovar, 2003)
was administered to 135 teachers. Questionnaire administra-
tion made it easy to reach all the teachers within a short time
and with less effort; the return rate was 88.9%. Besides, the
results of the piloted instrument revealed that the teachers
were more upbeat about answering the questionnaire than
agreeing to be interviewed. Additional data were sought
through direct observation (both participant and non-
participant) of classroom and school activities to gain insight
into the natural occurrence of conflict in the schools and to
also validate data gathered from the questionnaire and inter-
views. This was done by sitting at the back of each class
keenly observing teaching and learning processes for two
instructional periods of 30 min in each school. This provided
opportunity to scan the classroom environment for conflict
incidents as the lessons went on in the participating teachers'
classrooms.
Opoku-Asare et al. 3
Observation was also done by moving around the school
compounds during the first and second break periods as the
pupils were engaged in different activities such as eating and
playing, to gather firsthand data on actual conflict situations
as they occurred. These methods of triangulation helped to
produce a more thorough understanding of the phenomenon
studied and thereby improve the authenticity of the research
findings (Hesse-Biber, 2010; Leedy & Ormrod, 2005).
Discussion
Prevalence of Conflicts
There was consensus among the teachers, headteachers, and
pupils in the sampled schools that disagreements and other
types of relationship conflict occur among the pupils, among
teachers, and between teachers and pupils, teachers and
headteachers, teachers and parents of pupils, and schools and
their local communities. As to its prevalence, 99.2% (119) of
the 120 teachers and all 30 headteachers and 130 pupils
described conflict as a daily occurrence, particularly among
the pupils. This corroborates Siann and Ugwuegbu's (2000)
finding that relationship conflicts occur among these key
players in the school system, all of which have direct nega-
tive consequences for teaching, learning, and educational
standards. This is despite efforts made by the headteachers
and guidance and counseling committees to apply existing
conflict resolution guidelines to deal with disagreements,
quarrels, fights, and other relationship conflicts that erupt in
the schools. The study however, points to the established
conflict resolution structures being ineffective for resolving
relationship conflicts that occur among personnel who func-
tion in the school environment, which calls for further
research into Ghana's policy and procedure for conflict man-
agement in the basic school system.
Forms of Conflict
Conflicts that were identified in the schools manifested as
quarreling, fighting, yelling, heckling, confrontation out of
anger, jostling, and bullying among the pupils; verbal abuse,
caning, and excessive punishment meted to pupils by teach-
ers; angry teachers and parents quarreling or exchanging
harsh words and insults; angry parents chasing their children
to school to punish them or report offenses caused at home to
get them punished; as well as heated arguments, quarrels,
and strong disagreements between headteachers and
teachers.
Pupils' Perceptions of Conflict
Interviews with the 130 pupils revealed four types of rela-
tionship conflict that frequently occur in the sampled schools:
82 (representing 63.1%) of them reported pupil­pupil con-
flicts, 21 (or 16.2%) mentioned teacher­pupil conflicts, 10
(or 7.6%) pupils identified teacher­parent conflicts, while 17
(or 13.1%) of them cited pupil­parent conflicts. The data
show pupil­pupil conflicts as the most rampant relationship
problem prevalent in the 30 sampled schools. Table 1 pro-
vides the factors that are perceived to cause these types of
conflicts.
As Table 1 indicates, the pupils pointed out teasing, gos-
siping, trickery, and jealousy as the significant factors that
generate the most relationship conflicts among them. Further
probing revealed that most quarrels, insults, and fighting
emerge from pupils teasing each other because they are too
tall or short, too fat or thin, or they are unable to answer
questions in class. Bullying of younger pupils by the older
ones both on the playground and on the way home from
school, jealousy over unequal personal resources, and steal-
ing of other pupils' pocket money, erasers, and writing mate-
rials also feature prominently as sources of friction, tension,
and fights among the pupils.
The pupils attributed conflicts that occur between teach-
ers and pupils to teachers venting anger with their parents on
them; teachers punishing pupils who steal, fight, or use abu-
sive language; and pupils who gossip over suspected amo-
rous relationships between male teachers and the older
female pupils that they are too afraid to talk openly about.
They also ascribed conflicts that occur between teachers and
parents to teachers insulting their parents for the pupils'
wrongdoings, which often get reported at home and cause
parents to retaliate; teachers being too harsh on pupils; teach-
ers punishing pupils with excessive weeding on the school
farm; and harassment over unpaid fees and levies. Last,
pupils reported that conflict between pupils and parents arise
from angry parents following their children to school either
to punish them for disobedience, theft, or misbehavior at
home, or reporting such offenses to get them punished by
their teachers. It is important to indicate that at some points
of the focus group conversation, some of the pupils expressed
grave concern over unsavory comments some of their teach-
ers make when they have difficulty understanding what is
taught.
The most unpleasant comments were made by pupils
whose teachers often insult their parents over their mistakes,
conduct, or learning difficulties. Expressions of disgust were
obvious from interjections such as, "Why should my teacher
insult my mother who is at home when I am the one in the

classroom?" "What at all can I do wrong for my mother to be
insulted like that?" "Sometimes you don't know what you do
wrong for a teacher to extend your insult to your mother,"
and "It is as if they did not bring us up well enough to please
our teachers." Asked why they report school happenings to
their parents, some of the pupils' answers were, "My parents
brought me to school so they have the right to know what
goes on here," "They want to know how the teachers treat us
in school; it is important," and "I must report the punishment
the teacher gives me before my brother or friend goes to tell
my mother otherwise she will whip me for misbehaving in
school." Others do not report "bad" happenings to prevent
more quarrels from ensuing between teachers and members
of the local community, which often brings about quarrels
and insults that make it difficult for pupils to enjoy school.
Asked what happens when they report school occurrences
to their parents, many of the pupils replied with, "They don't
say anything or do anything to those teachers," "Even if I
report the teacher's bad behavior, my mother only says `don't
mind them,' which makes me ashamed for making that
report," and "My parents only tell me to work hard so the
teacher will be happy with me." Some of the pupils insisted
their reports anger their parents and cause tension that some
relatives and community members follow up with confronta-
tion that worsen school­community relations, which makes
the teachers hate them. Although many of the pupils' reports
attract strong conflict behaviors and responses, many of the
pupils' parents ignore their children's negative reports. This
however, does not negate the fact that teacher­parent con-
flicts exist in the sampled communities.
The variety of responses that emerged from the pupil
interviews show the importance pupils attach to both family
and school ties; they cherish both home and school relation-
ships. The emotional attachment with their mothers, the
pupils said, makes it difficult for them to refrain from dis-
closing embarrassing and hurtful incidents that occur in
school to them. Essentially, if a teacher insults a pupil's par-
ents for the child's wrongdoing in school, the pupils con-
cerned felt obliged to respond the best way, which is to report
the insult or incident to their parents for redress.
Effects of Conflict on Teaching and
Learning
Teacher­Pupil Conflict
According to the pupils, if a conflict emerges between a
teacher and a pupil or pupils and it is resolved, some teachers
refuse to let go of the issue but use it as a weapon to punish
the offending pupil by relating poorly with them. This makes
the affected pupil unhappy, embarrassed, and uncomfortable
in the teacher's presence both inside and outside the class-
room. Even after conflicts have been settled, the pupils reit-
erated that "some teachers keep on making references to
whatever caused the conflict they had had with the pupils
even during lessons, which causes us much embarrassment
and makes us want to run away from the presence of our
classmates." In some situations, it was reported that a teacher
could hate the offending pupil to the extent of refusing to
mark exercises those pupils present in class, refusing to call
on those pupils to answer questions they ask during lessons,
and more irritatingly, refusing to call on such pupils who
dare to raise their hands either to ask or answer questions, or
they simply ignore them in all class activities. The apt
response to such a situation was, "This hurts so much you
don't want to come to school the next day if your friends
don't come to get you," which portends the possibility of
pupils dropping out of school if this denial persists.
The pupils intimated that when their teachers deny them
these rights in class, they feel awkward in the midst of their
peers, which also adversely affects their ability to learn.
According to the pupils, such conflict aftermath
makes it difficult for those pupils to assess their performance in
class; in this case, the timid pupil may decide to stay out of the
teacher's way by not coming to school just to avoid that situation,
and may eventually drop out of school if no one goes after them.
The pupils also made it clear that sometimes when a conflict
occurs between a teacher and a pupil, other teachers join the
fray, and in solidarity with their colleague, they also harass
the pupil in school. Such a pupil becomes very uncomfort-
able in the school environment and cannot go to see their
siblings and friends in other classrooms. The implication is
that pupils in conflict with particular teachers could end up
being unnecessarily punished by other teachers in their
school. This scenario runs contrary to the expectation that
teachers would act in loco parentis (as surrogate parents) to
their pupils and that this parenting role would compel pupils
to replicate the feelings they have for their parents to their
teachers (Orlich, Callahan, & Gibson, 2001).
Close interactions between teachers and pupils should
rather forge bonds of trust and mutual support between them
so that the teachers could exert their influence to control the
classroom environment to significantly reduce tension and
increase the probability of successful learning and social
progress for their pupils (Orlich et al., 2001). After all, the
Education for All program implies children coming to school
and enjoying the experience of learning, and developing
their full potential through education to ensure their full and
equal participation in building a better world (Oxfam, 2005).
Relationship conflict is therefore a risk factor to consider as
far as Ghana's attainment of the Millennium Development
Goal 2 of "increased primary enrollment by 2015" (Ministry
of Education, Youth and Sports [MOEYS], 2004) is
concerned.
The sentiments the pupils expressed over the aftermath of
conflicts that occur in the sampled schools corroborate Siann
and Ugwuegbu's (2000) assertion that negative attitudes of
teachers lower their pupils' self-esteem, which calls for
Opoku-Asare et al. 5
attention and intervention by education officials in the study
area, especially where primary school teachers in Ghana are
assigned to specific classes only and, as generalist classroom
practitioners, also teach all subjects on the timetable (Boafo-
Agyemang, 2010). Knowing that positive teacher­child rela-
tionships serve as a protective factor for positive social and
academic development of children implies that tension may
undermine the pupils' willingness to stay in school and
achieve their educational and life goals (Rudasill & Rimm-
Kaufman, 2009).
It is important to state here that the pupils' description of
conflict occurrences and their effects on teaching and learn-
ing in the 30 schools were almost the same. Except for the
6- to 10-year-old pupils who had few or no conflict stories to
narrate, the 12- to 13-year-olds were very vocal about the
episodes they had observed in their own classrooms or other
classes, and even mimicked the behavior of some of the
teachers who had engaged in such confrontations. The narra-
tions showed that interpersonal conflict is a regular feature in
the sampled schools and a great source of worry to the pupils
who also pointed out the threat of conflict on their educa-
tional aspirations. Including conflict studies in teacher devel-
opment programs would equip newly trained teachers in
particular with the basic knowledge to understand the effects
of relationship conflicts and to also acquire some skills for
conflict prevention and peace building in the schools.
Teacher­Parent Conflict
The pupils reported that after some teachers have had a con-
frontation with a parent, those teachers displace their anger
on the children of those particular parents although they may
have played no role in it. This, the pupils said, adversely
affects their absorbing capacity for the day. Another worry-
ing issue was that some teachers take delight in constantly
mentioning the wrongdoings of parents during lessons just to
spoil their day and embarrass them. What bothered the pupils
most was that those teachers waste instructional time just
hammering on whatever a parent had done and, sometimes,
they insult those parents as well. The burning questions the
pupils kept asking were, "Why should my teacher insult my
parent at all in the classroom?" and "What wrong did they
do?" Sincerely, a teacher who uses instructional time to fan a
conflict would certainly not be able to complete the assigned
syllabus, which invariably has adverse effects on all the
pupils' ability to assimilate what is taught and, in the
long term, their academic achievement and educational
opportunities.
The findings suggest that pupils in the district suffer
unduly from the effects of "made-in-the-community" con-
flicts that get carried into the classroom, which could prevent
the pupils from attaining the full benefits of schooling. The
level of conflict occurrence also contradicts the expectation
that teachers would collaborate with parents to promote the
social, emotional, and academic growth of their pupils to
motivate them to stay in school and complete their education
(Orlich et al., 2001). Sour relationships between parents and
teachers, the two key figures at the center of children's edu-
cation, suggests inadequate interpersonal and conflict man-
agement skills for dealing with issues of conflict in the study
area. These significant adults in the children's lives may also
not be fully aware of the complementary role they play as far
as the children's education is concerned. Besides, pupil
achievement in primary school depends largely on teacher
goodwill (Boafo-Agyemang, 2010) and active monitoring of
teaching effectiveness (Opoku-Asare, 2006); hence, achiev-
ing quality primary education must necessarily entail educa-
tion officials focusing much attention on promoting good
interpersonal relationships in the schools.
Teachers' Perceptions of Conflict
Understanding of Conflict
The teacher is a very crucial element in attaining quality edu-
cation. Achievement of the objectives of any curriculum
depends to a great extent on teachers who have a strong com-
mitment to teaching so that they might be a source of inspira-
tion to their pupils and effective facilitators of learning
(Colker, 2008). The teachers' responses to the questionnaire
revealed three views of conflict: 108 (representing 90.0%) of
the 120 respondents defined conflict as "a misunderstanding
or disagreement between two or more people or groups of
people." This reflects the basic definition provided in the lit-
erature, which shows that the large majority of the teachers
understand what conflict means and could identify conflict
situations in the schools.
Nine (or 7.5%) of them defined conflict as "a fight
between two or more people," which suggests that this group
of teachers could ignore early signs of conflict and would
intervene only when it escalates into physical assault or vio-
lence. These teachers could find it difficult to resolve conflict
because they might not see it brewing as a serious matter or
a threatening situation at its early stages of development.
Being handicapped in conflict identification from the grass-
roots puts the pupils of these teachers at risk if they should
experience any psychological problems that do not manifest
as physical assault or overt actions.
The remaining three teachers defined conflict as "a mere
argument between two or more people." This view of con-
flict suggests that these teachers would interpret any argu-
ment as an issue of conflict and address it as such. This
perception could create unnecessary relationship problems
with their colleagues, pupils, and people they may come in
contact with on the basis that they could regard any expres-
sion of ideas or merely arguing one's views out on an issue
of mutual interest as a conflict. Consequently, lessons taught
by these teachers might generate conflict where pupils or
other teachers need to debate issues or express views that are
different from theirs.
6 SAGE Open
Types of Conflicts Identified
The types of conflicts and the frequency of responses that
highlighted the respective conflicts in response to the ques-
tionnaire are as follows: conflict among pupils (81 responses),
conflict between teachers and parents (75 responses), con-
flict between teachers and headteachers (63 responses), con-
flict between teachers and pupils (45 responses), conflict
between pupils and parents that gets carried into school (39
responses), conflict among teachers (34 responses), and con-
flict between schools and their local communities (20
responses). Causal factors of these seven types of conflicts
the teachers identified are summarized in Table 2.
Perceived Effects of Conflict on
Teaching and Learning
Of the 120 teachers surveyed, 114 (representing 95%)
reported that conflicts that occur in their schools have direct
negative effects on teaching and learning. The remaining six
(or 5%) respondents were of the view that conflict in their
schools produce positive results on teaching and learning as
the teachers and pupils try to prove their point on issues of
mutual interest and also bring out their values and personal
differences in relation to work ethics. Similar to Whetten and
Cameron's (2005) assertion, these teachers believe conflict
can yield positive results to those involved. Pervasive con-
flicts have both short- and long-term implications for educa-
tional opportunities of children in Ghana. The high incidence
of conflict among teachers and pupils in the sampled schools
could partly be attributed to the high population (55%) of
20- to 30-year-old, less experienced teachers working with a
few (15%) elderly, more experienced, and soon-to-retire
teachers aged 50 to 60 years old in the schools.
The senior teachers could serve as role models for the
younger teachers to emulate; they could also use their tradi-
tional knowledge, class management experience, and skills
in parenting to help the younger teachers deal with their rela-
tionship problems so they can help to prevent conflict from
emerging in the classroom. However, having a small popula-
tion of experienced teachers in the schools implies insuffi-
cient mentors for the younger teachers to turn to for advice in
case of difficulties, for ideas about how to address specific
students' needs, or for insight in their subject areas. The sce-
nario also suggests the schools have inadequate "traditional
elders" to mediate or arbitrate "made-in-the-community"
conflicts and prevent them from adversely affecting aca-
demic work and relationships in the schools.
All things being equal, the senior teachers could use their
"I-have-been-there-before" experience (Opoku-Asare, 2000)
to coach younger teachers posted to their schools to help
their pupils resolve relationship and behavioral problems
they encounter, or even serve as arbitrators to mediate con-
flicts that occur between individuals who function in the
school system.
These "elders" could also motivate their younger col-
leagues to adopt more pragmatic strategies to help their
pupils to understand the need for maintaining healthy rela-
tionships and promote peaceful school environments that
promote quality living. Nonetheless, inadequate classroom
management skills among both sets of teachers could also
push conflict and its management out of the limelight and
thereby cause minor disagreements to escalate and destroy
existing peaceful relations in the schools. This notwithstand-
ing, opposing ideas, decisions, or actions relating directly to
how to curb conflict on the job, expression of different val-
ues and work practices, as well as individual personality dif-
ferences (Ivancevich & Matteson, 2002) could generate
intragroup conflict between the older and younger genera-
tion of teachers. The good thing, however, is that 54 (or 45%)
of the 120 teachers were married, which implies having suf-
ficient numbers of "mother" and "father" figures for the
pupils to look up to for support in dealing with the issues of
life on a daily basis, and adequate numbers of adults with
relevant social and parenting skills to guide the pupils to
handle relationship problems amicably without resorting to
aggression, physical fights, or verbal assaults.
Nonetheless, as the pupil interviews revealed, some of the
teachers have poor rapport with their pupils to the extent of
refusing to teach them or mark their class work, which cre-
ates opportunity for some pupils to drop out of school. The
situation clearly undermines teachers'position in loco paren-
tis (Orlich et al., 2001) so that as role models, their pupils
would emulate their behavior to build good relationships and

also work out their differences harmoniously. The many
teacher­pupil, teacher­parent, and pupil­pupil conflicts are
simply out of touch with effective schooling.
The remaining 6 of the 120 teacher respondents were of
the view that conflict in their schools produce positive results
on teaching and learning as the teachers and pupils try to
prove their point (Whetten & Cameron, 2005) on issues of
mutual interest, and the values that relate to their personal
differences. The problem however, seems to hinge on adults
in the schools being unable to deal with their own personal
differences and thereby become role models for the pupils to
emulate. Laxity in the practice of school supervision (Opoku-
Asare, 2006) can contribute to high levels of interpersonal
conflict in the schools.
The teachers' responses to the questionnaire revealed that
when teachers and parents are in conflict, the teachers refuse
to show love to the wards of those parents, which goes a long
way to negatively affect the learning capacity of the pupils
concerned. In the same way teachers who get involved in
conflict with their headteachers tend to feel awkward in
school, often becoming withdrawn or unwilling to teach, and
if they do it at all, they do not put in much effort to deliver the
lessons as they are expected to do. This reduced level of
teacher productivity impinges directly on the quality of cur-
riculum delivery, learning effectiveness, pupil academic
achievement, and opportunity for secondary education. The
situation reflects Owens's (2001) view that conflict in
the school situation often develops into hostility that can take
the form of alienation, apathy, and indifference, which
directly affects the quality of relationships and educational
achievement for the pupils.
The questionnaire also revealed that pupils who get
involved in conflict with teachers tend to have low concen-
tration or even divided attention in class; instead of concen-
trating on what the teacher is teaching, their thoughts tend to
dwell on the conflict and its repercussions, which takes their
minds off the lessons and makes it difficult for them to absorb
what is taught in class. Those pupils' thoughts tend also to
get disturbed by the possible outcome of the conflict, which
invariably reduces their learning capacity and academic per-
formance over time. If such a conflict is not resolved as early
as possible, it may lead to overt and covert enmity between
the pupils and the teachers, which may increase the potential
for some pupils to become truants or even drop out of school.
Moreover, the use of instructional periods to settle conflicts
in the classroom leads to lost time for lessons, inability to
adhere to timetables, how much of the syllabus will be cov-
ered and invariably, how much the pupils will learn.
It emerged from the interviews that where pupils in con-
flict are in the same class, such pupils are reluctant to work
in the same groups, and also refuse to respond to questions
asked in class for fear of making mistakes and giving the
other pupils a cause to laugh, tease, or make fun of them
outside the classroom. These attitudes affect educational out-
comes negatively because their class teachers would not
know whether pupils who do not answer or ask questions
have understood the lessons or not. The Circuit Supervisors
responsible for the sampled district ought to pay regular vis-
its to the schools, effectively monitor teaching and learning
activities, and help the headteachers, teachers, and pupils
implement existing conflict resolution structures and thereby
promote a school culture of respect, harmony, collaboration,
and peace to enhance productivity in the schools. They could
also implement alternative dispute resolution strategies to
enable school personnel to deal effectively with the early
warning signs of conflict and how to mitigate their adverse
effects from affecting teaching, learning, and the school
environment.
Confrontation poses a great threat to interpersonal rela-
tionships in the school system, the pupils' education, and
future livelihood; it also has dire consequences for Ghana's
attainment of the Millennium Development Goal 2 of
increased primary enrollment by 2015 (MoEYS, 2004).
Headteachers' Perspectives of Conflict
One of the fundamental administrative functions of the
school head is to continually reduce barriers and consolidate
strong relationships between the school and parents and the
community at large so as to harness community support and
loyalty to improve teaching and learning, and thereby bring
about change in learner behavior. It is also the responsibility
of headteachers to create, nurture, and maintain an environ-
ment that invites teachers and students to expend their effort
into teaching and learning, and to implement the curriculum,
programs, and policies of the Ghana Education Service
(Afful-Broni, 2004; Mankoe, 2002; Umude, 2012).
Consequently, interviews were held with all the 30 head-
teachers, which revealed the prevalence of persistent rela-
tionship conflicts in their respective schools.
In identifying the types of conflicts experienced in the
schools, 25 (83.3%) of the 30 headteachers cited pupil­pupil
conflicts as the most rampant; two each cited teacher­pupil
and teacher­headteacher conflicts, respectively, while one
mentioned conflicts that emerge between teachers and par-
ents. The headteachers intimated that any kind of conflict
that emerges in the school environment has direct conse-
quences for teaching and learning, with 27 or 90% of them
attesting that conflict also undermines school administration.
They conceded that headteachers find it very difficult to
assign duties to teachers they are in conflict with, particu-
larly when a teacher is absent and one of them must step in to
enable the pupils do profitable work for the day. They
recounted that where conflict arises between a teacher and a
pupil, the teacher usually stops teaching to address the con-
flict; when conflict occurs between pupils of the same class
during teaching periods, their teachers also spend part of the
instructional periods settling the conflict, which wastes time.
Table 3 summarizes the factors the headteachers attributed to
conflicts that occur in their schools.
8 SAGE Open
According to the 30 headteachers, what makes the situa-
tion worse is that primary school teachers in Ghana are gen-
eralist teachers who teach all the subjects on the primary
school timetable and are also assigned to one class of pupils
only (Boafo-Agyemang, 2010; Opoku-Asare, 2000), so
pupils who get into conflict with their teachers cannot benefit
fully from what is taught in all the subjects that constitute the
primary curriculum. In some cases, the headteachers inti-
mated that the pupils could convey distorted messages of
such relationship conflicts in school to their friends at home
and create unnecessary tension. In the worse situation,
offended pupils could get their friends to assault the teachers
involved. Eventually, a teacher could be transferred from a
school in which they have had problems, which ends up neg-
atively affecting the staffing situation in the school, particu-
larly rural schools to which many qualified teachers refuse to
accept postings (The President's Committee on Review of
Education Reforms in Ghana Report, 2002).
On the contrary, 3 (10%) of the 30 headteachers reported
during the interviews that conflicts that occur in school can
also positively affect academic work and the individuals
involved. They explained that conflict brings out individual
differences in people and highlights the need for coopera-
tion; if conflicts are amicably resolved and both parties are
satisfied, their productivity increases (Jennings & Wattam,
2004; Owens, 2001; Robbins, 2000). This implies that con-
flict aftermath could impact positively on teaching and learn-
ing. Nonetheless, the 90% affirmation of the adverse effects
of conflict on schooling by the headteachers suggests that
conflict poses more problems for classroom and administra-
tive work than it yields any positive effects.
Observation
Although the questionnaire responses provided by the 120
teachers and evidence from interviews with the 30 head-
teachers and 130 pupils hinted the existence of different
types of relationship conflicts in the schools, no significant
teacher­pupil and teacher­teacher conflicts were observed in
any of the 30 schools. It is possible that collegial responsibil-
ity to maintain cordiality among the teachers and mutual
respect that requires that personal differences should not
interfere with professional practice, particularly where "out-
siders" whose intention of visit they knew were present, was
the motivation for the teachers to behave civilly to each other
during the period of observation. It was obvious that the
teachers simply acted unnaturally to avoid any conflict
occurring between them and their pupils, suggesting that the
teachers are better positioned to prevent others from driving
them into conflict. As adults, they are more likely to consider
alternative strategies to deal with conflict situations they
encounter, especially where "strangers" are present in their
working environment. Nonetheless, the high levels of con-
flict that occurred among the pupils in class and at play sug-
gest the pupils' lack of self-control and adequate numbers of
role models to show them the proper way to address their
grievances. The good thing is that children easily make up
after disagreements, and even after fighting, they quickly
forget such disputes and resume their play.
The apparent absence of conflict occurrences between the
sampled schools and their local communities suggests little
or no interaction or peaceful co-existence between the
schools and their communities. It is also possible that the
traditional leaders apply arbitration, mediation, and consen-
sus building strategies to resolve conflicts that erupt between
the school and the communities. Unfortunately, this seeming
harmonious co-existence does not reflect in the behavior of
the pupils who often resort to fighting, heckling, and other
physical forms of abuse to resolve their differences, particu-
larly on the playground and on their way home from school
where no adult supervises them. The level of observed con-
flicts on the playground could be attributed to the absence of
teachers on supervisory duties (Owusu-Mensah, 2007).
Pervasive conflict among the pupils could also be a reflec-
tion of the level of conflicts they encounter in their commu-
nities, which they had learned as acceptable means of
handling disagreements.
Few issues of teacher­headteacher conflicts were, how-
ever, observed at staff meetings that were held in the head-
teachers' offices in all 30 schools, to which the researchers
were invited. Conflicts also erupted between teachers and par-
ents, between headteachers and parents, and also between the
headteachers and Parent­Teacher Association (PTA) officials
at scheduled PTA meetings in 15 schools. The teacher­parent

conflicts emerged from parents being angry because their
children were being unduly harassed over delayed payment
of PTA dues, school fees, and other levies; frequent high-
handed punishments meted to pupils who break school rules,
steal or fight in school; parental complaints about teacher
lateness or irregular attendance to school; and perceived
amorous relationships between male teachers and the older
female pupils in some cases. Strong arguments and quarrels
occurred between some headteachers and their schools' PTA
officials for lack of transparency in disbursing PTA funds
and the government's Capitation Grant, which is meant for
basic schools to offset their recurrent expenditure.
Interestingly, the researchers' presence in the schools did
not stop the PTA meetings or prevent the occurrence of
intense disagreements and strong arguments because the
agenda for those meetings were set long before the research-
ers negotiated access to the schools; the parents and officials
concerned were compelled to attend with no option to do
otherwise. Having "outsiders" at those meetings did not
seem to matter as differences had to be resolved and misun-
derstandings cleared; the people simply made every effort to
make their voices heard, and many did not mince words in
expressing how strongly they felt with the issues discussed.
Conclusion and Recommendations
Primary schools in the study district experience persistent
conflict, which has direct adverse consequences for teaching
and learning, whether it occurs between a teacher and a pupil
or pupils, between a teacher and the head of a school, or
between teachers and parents. Conflict between a teacher
and headteacher can lead to a teacher's reluctance to provide
quality teaching to their pupils and cause them to lose out on
what they should gain from the curriculum. School­
community conflict can also slow down the cordial relation-
ship between school authorities and the communities. The
state of affairs in the study area points to laxity in the practice
of school inspection (Arthur, 2011; Opoku-Asare, 2006) and
perhaps also accounts for ineffective curriculum delivery,
low pupil achievement, and lowered standard of education in
the district (Owusu-Mensah, 2007).
The idea is that when schools, families, and communities
work together to support learning, pupils tend to do better in
school, stay longer in school, and show greater commitment
to learning (Levin & Young, 1994, as cited in Mankoe, 2002).
It is necessary therefore that the district education office
takes steps to improve the leadership skills and managerial
effectiveness of the headteachers to enable them to build
positive working relations with their staff so that they can
liaise to curb conflict occurrence in the schools and promote
academic productivity.
Knowing that conflict in primary schools, irrespective of
the type, affects the pupils' education, and having found that
conflict between pupils occurs every day in the sampled pri-
mary schools suggest the urgent need to adopt measures to
educate schools in the district on conflict and its negative
impacts on their academic performance. Resolving these
issues will improve peace building and ease tension between
the key players in the education enterprise. The level and
nature of conflicts experienced in the schools also suggests
that the School Management Committees and PTA officials
are not visiting the schools regularly to monitor the perfor-
mance of pupils and to help in solving school problems
(Addae-Boahen & Arkorful, 2001; Owusu-Mensah, 2007).
District level checks to monitor supervisors' performance in
ensuring quality standards in the district could detect ten-
sions that militate against teacher efficiency and pupil learn-
ing, and thus help enhance the educational experience for
the pupils. These are issues that directly affect relationships
and make it difficult for effective teaching and learning to
go on.
It is important also that school authorities complement
pupils' good behaviors and reward them somehow to encour-
age them to continue to behave well in school. Instituting peer
mediation teams comprising well-behaved pupils and equip-
ping them with conflict resolution skills would enable these
role models to help their schools handle interpersonal conflict
more effectively. This group could be trained periodically by
the district education office, civil society, or any community
based or non-governmental organization, which is interested
in conflict management so that schools in the district would
have relatively reduced conflict environments. It is also neces-
sary for pupils to be educated on existing conflict resolution
mechanisms in the schools and the associated sanctions for
offenses.
Conflict resolution bodies such as the Disciplinary, and
Guidance and Counselling Committees in the schools
(Addae-Boahen & Arkorful, 2001; Owusu-Mensah, 2007;
Umude, 2012) should be strengthened to enable them to edu-
cate the pupils on better ways of handling conflict to promote
good neighborliness among the pupils and thereby curb
intractable issues of conflict and create an enabling environ-
ment for teaching and learning to occur in the schools.
Instituting peer mediation teams and peace clubs with pupils
who are disciplined and well behaved could help the schools
manage relationship conflicts. Further research on conflict in
Ghanaian schools would identify effective intervention strat-
egies that would be appropriate for minimizing or curbing
conflicts that occur in the schools.
