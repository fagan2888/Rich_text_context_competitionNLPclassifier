Introduction
When families affected by armed conflict are asked to speak
about their quality of life (QoL), education is mainly referred
to as a key dimension affecting the well-being of the younger
generations (Bragin & Opiro, 2012; Veronese, Castiglioni,
Barola, & Said, 2012; Veronese, Castiglioni, Tombolani, &
Said, 2012; Veronese & Castiglioni, 2013; Veronese, Fiore,
Castiglioni, & Natour, 2014). In fact, the community fre-
quently views education as a means of providing hope and a
better future for the youth. In addition, providing education
in response to conflict and to promote early recovery may be
considered a key element of humanitarian aid, along with
food and water, shelter, and health (Machel, 2001). The
importance of education in war-affected areas is emphasized
in the 2011 Education for All (EFA) Global Monitoring
Report, The Hidden Crisis: Armed Conflict and Education
(United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization [UNESCO], 2011). According to this report,
wars in poor regions are one of the obstacles to strengthening
the role of education systems in preventing poverty and
enhancing QoL in civilian populations. In war-affected
regions, it is estimated that 28 million school-aged children
are unable to attend primary school, accounting for 42% of
the world's out-of-school children. The countries in which
they live are often characterized by protracted internal politi-
cal violence, in turn associated with exploitation, juvenile
labor, imprisonment, and overall abuse (Barakat, Connolly,
Hardman, & Sundaram, 2013). Frequently, schools, teachers,
and pupils are considered to be combatants and therefore tar-
geted (UNESCO, 2011). Few studies have examined the
field of education in emergencies and post-conflict transition
scenarios. It is therefore crucial to conduct further research
on the link between the reconstruction and enhancement of
the educational system, and the contribution of education to

Quality of Life and Determinants of
Parents' School Satisfaction in War
Contexts: A Mixed-Method Exploratory
Study in Palestine

Abstract
The present mixed-method exploratory study aims at exploring how families' perceptions of education are influenced by
the availability of resources promoting well-being and the ability to cope with political and military violence. A convenience
sample of 120 households selected in the Gaza Strip was administered using two self-reported instruments: WHOQOL-
BREF (WHO Quality of Life-BREF) adapted to the Palestinian context, and items adapted from the Teacher Involvement
of Parents (TIP) Questionnaire. The quantitative results showed interactions between different domains of quality of life--
namely, basic needs (B = .361, p < .01) and psychological distress (B = .307, p < .05)--while perceptions of education had
a statistically significant effect on school satisfaction. Three main themes emerged from the qualitative survey: economic
constraints, constraints on the school environment, and issues with the curriculum. The ongoing disruption of general
economic, environmental, health, and living conditions affects the domain of education, contributing to further undermining
opportunities for improvements in subjective well-being and familial quality of life.

QoL and well-being in war-like environments (Harber, 2004;
Smith, 2005). There are a small number of country-based
case studies that set out to conceptualize the "impact of edu-
cation" on protective and risk factors for subjective well-
being (Davies, 2011).
Given the complexity of the phenomenon, it seems crucial
to explore the ecological dimensions affecting people's QoL,
viewing education as a factor that is closely connected with
the environmental, socio-relational, and individual domains
of well-being (Boothby, Strang, & Wessels, 2006; Thabet,
El-Buhaisi, & Vostanis, 2014; Veronese & Castiglioni, 2013;
Veronese, Castiglioni, Barola, & Said, 2012).
Arecent work based on data from focus group discussions
with different groups of Palestinians on the determinants of
QoL (literally translated into Arabic as "Jawdatal-hayat")
found that participants' perceptions could be grouped into
four domains: the financial situation, the consequences of
ongoing military occupation for people's lives, the internal
Palestinian context (e.g., lack of basic needs), and family
issues (Giacaman et al., 2007). More focused cross-sectional
quantitative studies of representative samples of households
in the Gaza Strip found that, generally speaking, Palestinian
scores on QoL measures (physical, psychological and envi-
ronmental) were lower than in other countries (Abu-Rmeileh
et al., 2009; Massad et al., 2011). Giacaman strongly empha-
sized military occupation, war, and constraints imposed by
military violence as local determinants of QoL (Giacaman
et al., 2007). Veronese, Pepe, and Afana (2014) identified
two "macro" dimensions of QoL: a first factor called per-
sonal well-being (composed of both objective and subjective
aspects) and a second called political well-being (composed
of both micro- and macro-contextual dimensions) including
the role of education as a form of resistance that promotes
well-being (Veronese, 2013).
Based on the viewpoint that education is an important
component and determinant of QoL, we set out to explore
the following variables: on the one hand, parental satisfac-
tion with schools and education (education; Khamis, 2013),
and on the other, multiple domains of QoL, namely, (dis)
satisfaction with living environment (environment), safety
and security (human security; Giacaman et al., 2007), stress-
ful living conditions (psychological distress; Thabet, Abed,
& Vostanis, 2002, 2004), sociality (social support), and
family relationships (family; Thabet, Ibraheem, Shivram,
Winter, & Vostanis, 2009).
Working within from the perspectives on QoL just out-
lined, our mixed-method study had the aim of exploring how
families' perceptions of education might be influenced by the
availability of resources promoting well-being and the ability
to cope with political and military violence. We hypothesized
that education would be a factor in well-being that was influ-
enced by and circularly influenced the other QoL domains. In
other words, we expected that education could not be isolated
from other determinants of QoL and health. The study com-
prised both quantitative and qualitative components, and the
results were analyzed and compared to construct a broader
picture of families' perceptions of education, school, and
childhood in the Gaza Strip.
The Study Context
Palestinians commonly experience direct and indirect expo-
sure to violence, especially those living in the Gaza Strip;
political violence has led to restrictions being imposed on the
movement of Palestinian goods and people across borders
and within the Palestine territories: These restrictions have
seriously compromised the welfare of households, giving
rise to a loss of income, decreased quantity and quality of
food, and a lack of access to health care (Mataria et al., 2009;
Thabet, Abed, & Vostanis, 2001; Thabet & Vostanis, 2000),
Since 2000, poverty has risen dramatically, with more
than 38.8% of Palestinians currently living below the pov-
erty line (less than US$2/person/day; Palestinian Central
Bureau of Statistics, 2009).
June 2012 saw the beginning of the sixth year of the
intensified blockade imposed on the Gaza Strip by Israel.
The 5-year closure had and currently continues to have
disastrous effects on the lives of the 1.6 million of people
inhabiting these 365 square kilometers of land, in every
respect: social, economic, political, educational, and in
terms of human security (Safadi & Easton, 2014). The mea-
sures applied to restrict the movement of people and goods
leave the Palestinian population trapped in a vast, unhealthy
jail (Abu-Rmeileh et al., 2009). It is genuinely difficult to
travel outside the Strip; the restrictions have negative conse-
quences: they prevent the inhabitants of Gaza from traveling
abroad for training or study purposes or from keeping down
a job in Israel, and they also reinforce the distance and sepa-
ration from the Palestinian community in the West Bank
(Hanafi, 2012).
Operation "Cast Lead" was initiated in December 2009.
Officially justified as a response to the firing of rockets from
the Strip under the leadership of Hamas, it worsened a situ-
ation that was already highly unstable. During the 23 days of
the Israeli military offensive, over 1,380 Palestinians were
killed, including more than 300 children and civilians
(Giacaman et al., 2009). More recently, on November 2012,
the Israeli Air Force (IAF) launched an airstrike that tar-
geted and killed the acting chief of Hamas' armed wing,
Ahmed Al Jabari, marking the start of the Israeli military
action ("Operation Defensive Pillar") that lasted for 8 days.
Early accounts indicate that 174 Palestinians were killed,
including at least 43 children and 11 women. According to
the Ministry of Health, 1,399 Palestinians were also injured.
Six Israelis (4 civilians and 2 soldiers) were killed and 224
were injured. In Gaza, approximately 300 to 400 housing
units were destroyed or sustained major damage, while
another 1,700 houses suffered minor damage. At the height
of the conflict, approximately 12,000 individuals in Gaza
City and the governorate of Northern Gaza fled their homes
Veronese et al. 3
and sought refuge in emergency shelters set up in 14 United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 2 govern-
ment schools. According to the Ministry of Education, 42
schools were destroyed and 141 schools sustained damage
(Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
[OCHA], 2012). We completed our survey in the run up to
the September/October 2012 hostilities.
Finally, the most recent episode in the conflict was the
devastating Israeli attack named Operation Protective Edge
that took place in summer 2014. The 50-day war killed 2,168
Palestinians, of whom 1,666 were civilians, 501 children,
and 257 women. At least 138 schools, including 89 run by
UNRWA, were bombed or damaged, with the full extent of
damage still unknown according to the latest report by the
U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA, United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs occupied Palestinian territory, 2014).
Currently, most of the school buildings are in bad repair
and in need of maintenance; usually there are no play-
grounds or classrooms equipped for extra-curricular activi-
ties. Extreme overcrowding in schools and the double shift
system have negative consequences for the quality of educa-
tion: the school day is shortened, there is neither time nor
staff for after-school activities, and it is impossible for
teachers to adequately follow up all their students (Jabr,
2009). Furthermore, the restrictions on movement do not
allow the school staff to attend training courses or work-
shops outside Gaza and therefore to keep the educational
system abreast of developments in educational science.
Within this overall framework, little or no support is pro-
vided to children with disabilities or learning difficulties;
there is effectively no policy of inclusion in force. As a
result, in many cases children with difficulties are with-
drawn from school and kept at home.
Although the Palestinians are nonetheless considered to
be one of the most educated Arab peoples--and this is the
trend also in the Gaza Strip with a literacy rate of 96% in
2010--the lack of opportunity to study abroad and the high
unemployment rate make parents very pessimistic with
regard to their children's future careers.
Method
Participants
A convenience sample of 120 individuals was randomly
selected at a private school managed by a well-established
local non-governmental organization (NGO) and located
in the Jabalya area. We chose to conduct our pilot study
with participants recruited at a private school in which it
was possible to select a stratified socio-economic sample.
Specifically, the NGO running the private school involved
in our research was able to balance higher and middle-
income families with very poor families who were eligible
for an internationally funded sponsorship program enabling
children from low-income populations to attend a high
quality educational program. This choice allowed us to
pilot our research design with a non-representative but
demographically well-balanced sample.
Sixty married couples with school-aged children com-
pleted a questionnaire designed to collect information about
parents' own levels of QoL and their satisfaction with the
educational system. Specifically, 60 fathers (M
age
= 38.35 ±
9.56; range = 18-65) and 60 mothers (M
age
= 34.20 ± 6.37;
range = 18-55) participated in the survey. The selected fam-
ilies had five children on average (M = 4.6). More specifi-
cally, women aged 18 to 25 years had a mean of 3.5 children,
women aged 26 to 35 years 4.3 children, and those aged 36
to 45 years 5.2 children. The percentage of school-aged
children was 47% (M
age
= 6.5): 41% of these were attending
private schools, 33% UNRWA schools, and 21% public
schools. The income of these families ranged from US$200
to US$7,500 per annum (2,269 ± 1,684); in other words, they
ranged from medium to very poor economic status (accord-
ing to World Bank, 2013).
In addition, a purposive snowball sample of households
(n = 18) from the same group of participants was recruited to
participate in in-depth interviews at the school where the ques-
tionnaire had been administered (9 fathers, M
age
= 37.5 ± 4.7;
9 mothers, M
age
= 33.1 ± 6.2). Snowball sampling is a non-
probability sampling technique that is used by researchers to
identify potential subjects in studies in which subjects are hard
to locate. Researchers use this sampling method if potential
informants are rare or limited to a very small subgroup of
the population. This type of sampling technique is based
on chain referral. After collecting data from an initial
informant, the researcher asks this participant to help iden-
tify people with similar characteristics and so on (Babbie,
2001).
Instruments and Procedures
WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The QoL of the
parents was measured using items from the WHOQOL-
BREF (Skevington, Sartorius, & Amir, 2004). This instru-
ment was developed as a means of assessing health and
well-being that goes beyond objective descriptions of fatal
and non-fatal health outcomes and includes individuals' sub-
jective, affective, and cognitive appraisals of states of health.
It has facilitated cross-cultural comparisons of QoL (World
Health Organization [WHO], 1993). The WHOQOL-Bref
instrument aims to assess individuals' perceptions in the
context of their culture and value systems and of their per-
sonal goals, standards, and concerns (WHO, 1993). The
instrument consists of 26 questions measuring--by aggre-
gating respondents' answers to the different questions and
applying an appropriate rescaling strategy--the broad
domains of physical health, psychological health, social rela-
tionships, and environment. A set of questions related to the
Palestinian context has been added to the instrument and
4 SAGE Open
validated by the Institute of Community and Public Health of
Birzeit University (Abu-Rmeileh et al., 2009; Mataria et al.,
2009). On the basis of these additional questions, Giacaman
and colleagues (Mataria et al., 2009) identified the main
clusters of determinants of QoL, as well as the outcomes of
QoL, in Palestinian samples (West Bank and Gaza Strip).
Translation, adaptation, and validation of the resulting Pales-
tinian QoL instrument (PQoL) were carried out in 2005 by
Rita Giacaman with a team from the Institute of Public
Health at Birzeit University (Giacaman et al., 2007). The
PQoL questions are grouped into five domains (physical,
psychological, social, environmental, and war) using the
algorithm proposed by the WHOQOL team, with each
domain earning scores from 0 to 100 and higher scores indi-
cating better QoL. The fifth domain relates to war-like con-
ditions and the influence of the Israeli occupation on
Palestinian QoL and is a context-specific addition to the ear-
lier WHO instrument as mentioned above. In line with the
research aims of the current study, selected items from the
PQoL were grouped into the following dimensions: basic
needs (4 items;  = .801), social support (4 items;  = .842),
human security (3 items;  = .721), psychological distress (4
items;  = .766), and family support (2 items;  = .766).
Teacher Involvement of Parents (TIP) Questionnaire.Finally,
to assess the satisfaction of parents' with their involvement
by the schools, items adapted from the TIP Questionnaire
(Hoover-Dempsey, Walker, Jones, & Reed, 2002) were
administered. More specifically, participants completed
eight items from the Beliefs About Parental Involvement
subscale (answers provided on a 5-point Likert-type scale;
 = .763).
The present study adopted a mixed-method approach pri-
marily because this kind of research design lends itself to
connecting micro, meso, and macro levels of explanation of
a given construct (Bergaman, 2010, 2011; Bryman, 1988;
Creswell, 2009). Indeed, comprehension of a complex phe-
nomenon such as parents' school satisfaction encompasses
an array of factors affecting the family's evaluation of school
contexts and involves different levels of explanation: from
the micro-system level (e.g., demographic variables such as
gender, age, and socio-economic status; Pepe & Addimando,
2014) to the meso-system (e.g., network of relationships,
social support) and, finally, the macro-system (e.g., the envi-
ronmental and economic situation).
The data analysis comprised two steps: first, the quantita-
tive measures and demographic information about partici-
pants were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression
techniques to identify the main determinants of school satis-
faction; then, the quantitative results were cross-validated
and integrated with the qualitative findings via thematic
content analysis of the in-depth interview transcripts. This
kind of mixed-method strategy is known as complementary
analysis (Bazeley & Kemp, 2012), and it is usually used to
complete, enhance, and detail a significant whole, with each
piece of quantitative and qualitative information contribut-
ing to building up a total representation.
More specifically, in the quantitative analysis, hierarchi-
cal multiple regression (see Cohen & Cohen, 2003; Stanovich
& Cunningham, 2004, for methodological procedures) was
used to explore the impact of specific measures of well-being
on school satisfaction when the effect of gender, age, and
family income were controlled for. To this end, the enter
method was used to add the independent variables step by
step in the desired order: demographic variables (age, gen-
der, and family income) were entered first, the PQoL mea-
sures (basic needs, social support, human security,
psychological distress, and family support) were entered
next at Step 2, and, finally, interaction terms were evaluated
at Step 3 (All Quantitative Measures × Gender). The regres-
sion model was assessed at each step for statistically signifi-
cant variation in the coefficient of determination (R2).
Unstandardized beta weights (B) were also used to assess the
variables added to the regression model (Meier, Brudney, &
Bohte, 2012). All data were checked for potential violation
of regression assumptions (i.e., homoscedasticity, multivari-
ate normality; see Petrocelli, 2003, for further detail) and
Mahalanobis distances (at p > .001) were calculated to iden-
tify and skip multivariate outliers.
The interviews with the families were conducted follow-
ing an ethnographic procedure (see above for details of the
snowball sampling recruitment method): The participants
were asked to speak about their living conditions and their
children's experience at school in a context characterized by
ongoing conflict and occupation. To analyze the qualitative
data, thematic content analysis was applied (see Braun &
Clarke, 2006 for background on this methodological proce-
dure) to the interview transcripts to inductively identify com-
mon themes regarding parents'perceptions and evaluation of
school-related issues. To this end, the authors first transcribed
all the interviews, then, within a single unit of text (i.e., an
interview), similar themes were grouped together, collapsed
and labeled according to their explicit meanings (this process
was repeated for all the interviews), and, finally, the occur-
rences of the categories thus identified were counted to
assess which themes were more salient within the texts.
Results
In Table 1, we present descriptive statistics regarding QoL in
Palestinian families.
With regard to demographic variables, gender was posi-
tively correlated with satisfaction with education (r = .310,
p < .01): specifically, women were more satisfied with edu-
cation than men, while number of children was negatively
correlated with basic needs (r = -.390, p < .01), social sup-
port (r = -.281, p < .05), and satisfaction with the educa-
tional context (r = -.246, p < .01). In addition, parents' level
of education was positively correlated with basic needs
(r = .450, p < .01), social support (r = .434, p < .01), and
Veronese et al. 5
human security (r = .216, p < .01), and negatively with psy-
chological distress (r = -.186, p < .05) and number of chil-
dren (r = -.300, p < .05). Finally, economic status was
positively correlated with basic needs (r = .600, p < .05), social
support (r = -.186, p < .05), education (r = .264, p < .05), and
parents' level of education (r = .539, p < .05), and negatively
with the number of children (r = -.301, p < .05).
Zero-order correlations between each of the dimensions
of QoL are shown in Table 2. Social support is positively cor-
related with basic needs (r = .463, p < .01) and sense of secu-
rity and safety (r = .247, p < .01), whereas environmental
conditions are negatively correlated with psychological dis-
tress (r = -.318, p < .01). Finally, the dimension of education
is positively correlated with basic needs (r = .250, p < .01)
and social support (r = .294, p < .01); in other words, the
more families were satisfied with their living conditions and
felt that they had a good relational network supporting them,
the more they felt satisfied with the education system. When
the effect of satisfaction with basic needs were controlled
for, first-order positive correlations were confirmed between
social support (r = .259, p < .01) and human security
dimensions.
Three-step multiple regression analyses were conducted
to assess the influence of selected quantitative variables
(determinants) on the dependent variable satisfaction with
education (see Table 3).
At Step 1, F(3, 83) = 5.692, p < .001; R2 = .141, both gen-
der (B = 3.15, p < .001) and family income (B = 001, p < .05)
showed statistically significant effects, whereas age did not.
At Step 2, F(8, 78) = 4.08, p < .001; R2 = .223, the effect of
gender was still statistically significant (B = 3.31, p < .001)
whereas age and income were not. On the contrary, basic
needs (B = .361, p < .01) and psychological distress (B =
.307, p < .05) had a statistically significant effect on school
satisfaction, while other quantitative measures (social sup-
port, human security, family support) did not. At Step 2, a
highly statistically significant variation of R2 (r2 = .125),
F(1, 85) = 2.76, p < .05, was observed.
At Step 3, F(12, 74) = 2.91, p < .01; R2 = .210, the varia-
tion of R2 was not statistically significant (r2 = -.025), F(1,
85) = 0.614, p = .614, suggesting that the inclusion of the
multiplicative terms (QOL_variables × Gender) in the
regression equation did not explain significantly more vari-
ance with respect to Step 2. Finally, all the multiplicative
terms had p values ranging between .586 and .404 meaning
that none of them had an effect that was statistically signifi-
cant enough to justify their inclusion in the model.
Discussion
Analysis of the main themes in the qualitative data may be
used to qualify our discussion of the picture that emerged
from the quantitative regression analysis, in which satisfac-
tion of basic needs (based on family income) along with
degree of psychological distress (a negative correlate of
basic need fulfillment) displayed statistically significant
effects on school satisfaction. The thematic content analysis
of 18 in-depth interviews (approximately 36.000 word occur-
rences) identified, in the words of the participating parents,
three main categories of relevant themes (please note that
two or more themes could feature in a single interview): eco-
nomic constraints (58%), constraints on school environment
(41%), and teaching curriculum issues (38%).
Economic constraints. The economic domain emerged as the
main factor limiting access to adequate education and school-
ing (Giacaman et al., 2009; Thabet et al., 2014). Lack of eco-
nomic resources, lack of water and electricity, family
financial circumstances, unemployment, and dependence on
international aid were all factors making access to higher
education, in particular, increasingly difficult and uncertain
(Ziadni et al., 2011). This issue was cited by 58% of inter-
viewees. With regard to educational opportunities for chil-
dren, access to high quality schools is severely limited due to
family poverty. Despite strong awareness that future of the
younger generations hinges on educational opportunities,
severe economic limitations mean that parents are unable to
guarantee good careers to their children (Khamis, 2013).
I didn't re-enroll my son at the Salaam school because my
financial situation is very bad and I wanted to enroll him at the
UNRWA school but, again, I'm not able to do that because I
don't have his certificate. The Salaam school will not give me
his certificate because we did not pay the fees; so my son is
currently without any education [ . . . ] There is no work in Gaza
and the borders are always closed. The economic situation is
getting worse than before. (K.M., 24 years, jobless)
I regret that I will not be enrolling them at the school again, but
I cannot afford to on account of my financial situation. (A.A.,
31, housewife)
The quantitative data also show the economic conditions
to be a crucial challenge for Palestinian families (Giacaman
et al., 2007). The more families must struggle to cover basic
needs and obtain minimum economic resources, the more
they appear to be dissatisfied with educational opportunities.
In a similar fashion, the more income increases the more the

families benefit from educational opportunities insofar as
family income is a means of obtaining resources to fulfill
basic needs (see Step 2 of regression equation).
The fees . . . I am a government employee and my salary is not
very high and the school asks me to pay all the fees in one
instalment; I tried to convince them not to apply this procedure
to me, and I succeeded. (O.A.R., 29 years, office worker)
I am concerned because my children will not be able to complete
their education. Here, in Gaza, there is no future, the money we earn
is only just enough for our basic needs. (A.R. 31 years, office worker)
School buildings are not safe. (F.A.F., 42 years, housewife)
The number of children per family plays a key role in
diminishing education opportunities: considering that the
lowest income families have the highest numbers of chil-
dren, it is easy to infer the difficulties encountered by these
families in trying to ensure an adequate level of education for
all their offspring (Thabet et al., 2009). Nonetheless, the
majority of parents explicitly mention the importance of edu-
cation for personal and societal development:
Education is important because it makes society develop;
educated people deal well with other people and better than
uneducated ones. (O.A., 38 years, housewife)
It is really important for our children, especially for women:
they will be able teach their children. Moreover, it is the basis
for life and it builds society. It is especially important for
Palestinians because of the situation we are living in. It is easier
to deal with educated than with un-educated people. For
example, maybe an un-educated person would not allow their
wife to participate in this kind of interview or to have a job, or to
speak with other people. (S.A., 36 years, housewife)
The more educated parents generally enjoy a higher income
and are in a better position to provide their children with
good quality education. Furthermore, they were also more
interested in the "meta"-dimension of schooling.
The teachers are good but schools need supervisors to monitor
and follow up the teachers. (A.W., 44 years, doctor)
School environment. The conditions of the school are gener-
ally cited (41% of respondents) by the parents as a major
source of problems: Overcrowding appears to be the leading
issue in the eyes of families. Overcrowded classrooms under-
mine the school environment and affect the work of teachers
who are forced to follow up on too many students. According
to UNESCO's (2011) Institute for Statistics, the teacher/
pupil ratio in the West Bank and Gaza is 28 a very high value
if compared with the United States (14), Germany (13), or
the United Kingdom (18).

The classes are too crowded and it is difficult for the teacher to
follow up all the students: we need more teachers, more classes,
more materials and more care to be taken with activities . . . the
schools have to operate a double shift system. (S.H., 35 years,
driver)
The classes are too crowded at school, there is no electricity, no
computer lessons. There are not enough chairs and desks in the
classrooms for students to feel relaxed and comfortable. (A.W.,
44 years, doctor)
There are crowded classrooms, this means that students' right to
education is not respected; this also means that most of them are
prevented from following the lessons. Moreover, the schools are
far from our homes, the families need transport for their children
and sometimes their financial situation doesn't allow them to
provide for this. (D.S., 39, housewife).
School curriculum issues.
Teaching methods, curriculum
issues and poor teacher behavior were cited by 38% of
respondents. The families reported low-quality school curri-
cula as a consequence of disimprovements in the social wel-
fare system. Despite the Palestinian Authority's traditional
commitment to providing 100% scholarization, lack of
resources and lack of political self-determination drastically
reduce the means available to ensure high-standard school
curricula and methods (Giacaman et al., 2009). The deterio-
ration in the higher education system has also undermined
the training of teachers and administrators, negatively influ-
encing school teaching programs and educational methods.
In this regard, two major sources of complaint emerged: (a)
the teaching program and (b) teachers' level of training and
professionalism. In the first case, parents frequently used
terms such as too difficult and too vast to refer to the school
curriculum, which has not been developed or fitted to suit the
overall context in the Gaza Strip. In addition, working with
severely curtailed economic and financial resources forces
schools to reduce the number and the variety of extra-curric-
ular activities and the families seemed to identify this as a
further lack (Veronese, Castiglioni, & Said, 2010).
The curriculum is difficult and it is not suitable for the students'
ages. Moreover, schools do not give students the chance to
decide what to study in the future; at school, students do not
study subjects in depth, but just superficially. Moreover, at
school the students do not get to put into practice the notions that
they have learnt. (J.A., 31 years, general worker)
There are no summer camps, no activities and the teachers are
really bad with the students: that's why children don't like going
to school. (M.D., 31 years, housewife)
There is no educational material, no activities, no entertainment.
(A.W., 44 years, doctor)
With regard to teachers' professionalism, parents expressed
concern with both teacher quality and school organization.
This category encompassed a wide array of school dimen-
sions: from teachers' lack of interest to poor school­parent
communication to rudeness on the part of teachers and in a
small number of cases corporal punishment at school.
The quality of education is not good because some teachers are
bad. (F.A.F., 43 years, housewife)
There is a bad communication between parents and teachers and
students. The teachers are not good; the quality of education is
not good. (D.S., 39 years, housewife)
Sometimes I have found uncorrected questions in the books,
wrong answers given by the teachers that should be corrected by
teachers. Moreover, when we went to the school, we discovered
that our son had not been doing his homework for a long time
and the teachers had not informed us about this. I spoke with
them about the uncorrected answers, they said "it is only a small
thing and we are human and we can make mistakes," but in the
end I think that the teachers are not professional. (A.G., 33
years, office worker)
Once my daughter's teacher said bad words to her. Moreover,
when we went to the school we could not find the person in
charge of running it. (A.M., 42 years, engineer)
In sum, this last theme reflects the quantitative result
showing that social support as a determinant of QoL is
positively correlated with socio-economic status (Massad
et al., 2011). In fact, higher socio-economic status can
also ensure better social opportunities for children at
school; parents view the higher standards of teaching in
private schools as a crucial opportunity for their children,
compared with the poor social environment provided by
public schools.
Conclusion
Although Palestinians continue to be among the best-
educated peoples in war and poverty affected zones (Høigilt,
2013; Nasser, Berlin, & Wong, 2011), the ongoing disruption
of general economic, environmental, health, and living con-
ditions also affects the education domain, contributing to
further undermining opportunities for improvements in
subjective well-being and familial QoL (Batniji, 2013;
Hammoudeh, Hogan, & Giacaman, 2013). Families are
forced into a paradox: on the one hand, they identify educa-
tion as the one of the few opportunities for their children to
cope with adversity and daily suffering; on the other, they
see excellent educational opportunities as an extremely
remote prospect for the children of Gaza (Khamis, 2013).
From another perspective, vindication of the right to good
education opportunities shifts the difficulties of Palestinian
families from a "humanitarian" to a human security and
human development framework (Barber, 2013; Ziadni
et al., 2011).

Limitations
Like other studies in this area of research, the present work
has some limitations that should be taken into account in
interpreting its findings. First, the research was conducted
with a convenience sample recruited in a specific area of
Jabalya and does not reflect the heterogeneity of the
Palestinian milieu. This, along with the relatively small
sample recruited for this pilot study, precluded us from con-
ducting more sophisticated statistical analyses and means
that caution is required in generalizing the findings to other
populations. In particular, our non-representative though
demographically well-balanced sample may have caused
bias in terms of the overrepresentation of certain socio-eco-
nomic sectors within Palestinian society. Second, percep-
tions of QoL, satisfaction with education, levels of
involvement, and participants' socio-economic status (i.e.,
income, quality of neighborhood) may be interrelated and,
consequently, the findings may be affected by an interactive
confounding factor. Third, we tested for linear associations
between selected determinants and QoL; however, some
studies have identified a curvilinear relationship between
environmental characteristics and the different domains of
satisfaction. Further studies should be conducted, especially
from a cross-cultural perspective, with a view to developing
a more in-depth understanding of the potential differences
among determinants as well as differences in how they may
interact to affect QoL.
Implications
Educational intervention and empowerment should adopt
more "ease"-oriented perspectives, acting on the ecology of
suffering and restoring competence and dignity to Palestinian
citizens who are experiencing ongoing occupation and
chronic political and military violence. In conclusion, the
political dimension of well-being could provide practical
guidance for international aid system and national policy
agendas, as well as for human rights governmental and non-
governmental agencies.
Despite the limitations of this pilot study, field experience
and international research on education in contexts of politi-
cal violence confirm our findings (Brown, 2011; Novelli &
Lopes Cardozo, 2008). We consider it crucial to continue to
focus on well-being and community-driven interventions,
while developing more sophisticated and culturally sensitive
measures supported by qualitative surveys.
