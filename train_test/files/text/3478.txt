Parents as researchers:
collaborative ethnography

Abstract
This article describes a series of studies of young children's experience of place in which parents
acted as co-researchers, collecting and analysing data. This approach to research resulted in an
emphasis on sensory engagement and embodied experience, for both adults and children. As my
own young daughter accompanied me during this research, the boundaries between parent and
researcher were further blurred. As research progressed, parents became increasingly critical of
pathologising discourses about parenting, and stated more strongly the expertise they possessed
in their own children. Collaborative research with parents opened up new possibilities for
understanding the perspectives of very young children, by drawing on the expertise parents have.

The screen of the small hand held camera closely frames my 23 month-old daughter's
face, as her huge eyes peer curiously at it and at me. `Izzy, Izzy, what shall we do
today?' I ask in a high pitched sing song voice. `Shall we go to the museum?' Wordlessly,
my little girl changes her gaze, alters her expression, nods so vigorously that her whole
body bounces up and down on the bed. `What shall we do there?' I ask. Looking intently
into the screen, effort etched onto her face as she prepares to verbalise her ideas, Izzy
replies `mushroom, strawberry, grape.'
The above vignette describes an extract of video from my first experimentations with my
new FLIP video camera, a short piece of footage shot at home, a couple of months into
my doctoral research. My research would look at the experiences of toddlers as they
visited a museum with their parents. Being an ethnographic study, the research would

involve building ever closer relationships with a small group of families whose children
were the same age as my own daughter. Largely as a solution to balancing my studies
with motherhood, my daughter Izzy would accompany me on my visits to the museum
with families during this research.
This article draws on five years of research with parents and their young children in
communities in northern England. During my doctoral research and beyond it, I continue
to research collaboratively with some of the same parents. Their participation in the
research has increased over time, from traditional ethnographic participants to co-
researchers, working with me to shape research questions, collect and analyse data and
most recently, to act as a research advisory board for a project. Here I describe the pro-
cesses of doing collaborative research with parents. In addition, I describe some of the
findings this research has surfaced. The decentring of academic knowledge in the meth-
odology led to a foregrounding of materiality, emplaced knowing and children's and
adults' sensory engagement with places. The presence of my own daughter during field
work and collaboration addressed power imbalances in the research encounter to some
extent, by blurring the boundaries between researchers and participants (Tillman-Healy,
2003). Over time, the parent-researchers also began increasingly to voice their own
expertise in their children, coupled with a growing critique of pathologising discourses
about parenting.
What do parents know?
Interested in the multimodal nature of young children's communication (Flewitt, 2005;
Kress, 1997), my attention in the video described in the above vignette was initially
drawn to Izzy's scant use of words and the importance of her gaze and facial expressions,
as we exchanged ideas for several minutes about our planned museum visit. However,
this video interview also marked the beginning of my thinking about the expertise par-
ents have in their own children, and ways in which more collaborative approaches to
research could be employed to connect with this knowledge.
There are multiple of ways in which parents have expertise in their young children
that differ from academic expertise. In the interview with Izzy described at the beginning
of this article, I became aware of three aspects of parental expertise; firstly, I was better
able to identify her words than a stranger (no one else could tell the words she was saying
were `mushroom, strawberry, grape'). Secondly, certain aspects of non-verbal communi-
cation had established meanings for Izzy and I, which added context to our exchange. An
example of this is Izzy's `big smile', a grimace like expression, which she tended to
make every time she was asked to pose for a photo. Izzy made her `big smile' during our
conversation to indicate how she would approach other children in the museum. Thirdly,
parents often know the wider context of their children's lives best; `mushroom, straw-
berry, grape' referred to dressing up outfits that used to be at a certain local museum and
were no longer there.
Mayall (2000) argues for the need to `extricate children, conceptually, from parents,
the family and professionals' (2000: 243) in order to fully understand childhood. Whilst
I would concur, research seeking to understand the lives of very young children requires
different methods, and as a result, the social studies of childhood literature on the lives
Hackett 483
and experiences of children aged under five years is sparse (MacNamee and Seymour,
2013; Warming, 2011). In working with parents as co-researchers, I do not attempt to
privilege the voices of parents over the children themselves. Rather, I propose co-research
with parents as a way of better understanding the realities of young children, by drawing
on their parents' accounts and interpretations in addition to other forms of knowing,
particularly participatory ethnographic research with the children themselves. Mayall
(2000) states `psychological knowledge is relevant but not sufficient' (2000: 244) for
understanding childhood. In my collaborative research with parents, tacit, experiential
forms of knowledge were foregrounded, adding an additional perspective on how we as
adults might know about the lives of young children.
Five years of collaborative research with parents has expanded the initial observations
I outlined above about what parents might know, to encompass a broader view of the
expertise parents can bring to research about their children. Parents know about their
children through being with them, spending extended periods of time with them, and the
daily embodied experience of parenting them. In collaborative research with parents,
children's lived, embodied experiences (Pink, 2009), the materiality of place (Hultman
and Lenz Taguchi, 2010), and experiential and procedural forms of knowing (Niedderer,
2007) became very significant in our findings.
The relationship between parents and childhood research
Some of the earliest scientific studies of child development involved researchers making
detailed records of their own children's behaviour, Darwin and Piaget being two of the
most famous examples (Poveda, 2009). More recently, a growing need to re-balance the
over-representation of white middle-class children in research on children's develop-
ment, learning and language (Ochs and Schiefflin, 1984) has led to ethnographic studies
in which researchers have explicitly focused on under-represented groups and their lin-
guistic, parenting and socialising practices. Within these more etic approaches to ethno-
graphic research, several researchers have discussed the implications of researchers
being parents themselves while doing research with children and families (Cassell, 1987;
Levey, 2009). For example, Theophano and Curtis (1996) describe how, during ethno-
graphic research in an Italian American community, they were positioned and treated
differently by the community because Theophano was a married mother whilst Curtis
was single.
Researchers who are perceived by participants as parents have found that this has led
to opportunities to build rapport with other adults (McGrath, 1998; Wylie, 1987) and
offered a way of connecting with other children (Adler and Adler, 1996; Poveda, 2009).
McGrath (1998) touches on this potential for a deeper connection with others in her
description of parenting her own child alongside Tongalese mothers during fieldwork.
There is something deeper available, closer to empathy that emerges as a result of sharing
similar roles. (McGrath, 1998: 65)
Few studies have positioned parents as co-researchers. Adler and Adler (1996) describe
their longitudinal research on pre-adolescent school children, through observing their
484 Qualitative Research 17(5)
own children and the children of others in their children's school and community. Loizou
(2013) describes a parenting programme in which parents were invited to act as action
researchers, employing the tools of an action research methodology, in order to identify
and explore solutions to various parenting issues they faced. Liebenberg's (2009) study
involved asking teenage mothers to photograph their everyday mothering experiences,
creating a set of images which formed the basis of interviews. My research builds on this
small body of research in which parents played a more active role in collecting and ana-
lysing data about their own children, by placing a particular emphasis on foregrounding
the expertise parents themselves have.
The intensification of parenting within policy discourses (Gillies, 2007) has led to a
tendency to hold parents accountable for their children's `proper'development (Nichols
et al., 2009). Parents may therefore be pathologised by research (Burman, 2007) and
policy (Clarke, 2006) for failing to parent in culturally specific ways. In this way, par-
ents may become positioned as a threat to their children's `proper' development, whilst
childhood research may be seen as the `solution' to these perceived risks to children's
normative development (Burman, 2007; Gillies, 2007). Rather than create an opposi-
tional dichotomy between parents as unknowledgeable and a threat to children's devel-
opment and research as a source of expertise and solutions, parents as co-researchers is
a methodology seeking to emphasise the commonalities between parenting and child-
hood research. Both endeavours are emotional, engaged identity work, in which certain
kinds of understandings about children's experiences may become apparent, whilst
other aspects remain mysterious and unknowable (Elwick et al., 2014). Parents con-
stantly observe their children and make interpretations about their behaviour (Nichols,
2002). Researchers interested in the everyday lives of young children must also observe,
share experiences and try to make interpretations in order to begin to feel a connection
with their young participants' perspectives (for example, Warming, 2011). Researchers
are sometimes also parents. Reflecting on the experience of her own children accompa-
nying her during fieldwork, Joan Cassell describes the relationship between being a
parent and a researcher thus,
Fieldwork is a profound and emotional experience.... In parenting, we also risk ourselves.
Children are fragile links between our past and future, fears and hopes... We are doubly at
risk, then, when our children are in the field. In attempting to learn and grow, we risk failure
and sorrow, our own and theirs. In exposing ourselves, we expose them. (Cassell, 1987:
257­258)
Parents as co-researchers: describing the methodology
The insights in this article are drawn from a series of ethnographic studies I carried out
with a small group of parents in northern England. Following an ethnographic doctoral
study of 2 to 4 year-old children's meaning making in a museum (Hackett, 2014) and
inspired by the literature on collaborative approaches to ethnography (Lassiter et al,
2004; Pahl and Pool, 2011), I initially invited some of the parents from my original
study to return with me to the museum. These three parents had younger children,
siblings of the original participants, aged between 13 and 18 months. As with the
Hackett 485
original study, I was accompanied in the field by my own daughter (by now 36 months).
Therefore in this scenario, each adult was both a parent and a co-researcher in the field.
During this follow up visit, all four parents (including myself) used a FLIP video cam-
era to collect visual data, and wrote fieldnotes following the visit. We subsequently
met as a group at my house to share our different versions of the fieldnotes and analyse
them together.
The second study, `Parents as Researchers', involved three parents who had partici-
pated in my doctoral study. We jointly agreed a research question `How do our children
learn when they go to different places?', informed by parents' concerns that there were
few options for keeping their children busy and engaged during the summer holiday
break. In this community, parents were generally on a low income, and no one in the
study drove. Therefore, once the local Children's Centre scaled back its provision for
the summer break, options were limited to the local park or occasional soft play visit.
To address this concern, over a summer, we visited a park, a farm and the seaside with
our children, aged between 24 and 48 months. All four of us collected visual data in the
form of photographs which we compiled and annotated in scrapbooks, in order to record
our children's learning and engagement in these different places. We met as a group
three times during and following these visits to share, discuss and analyse the
scrapbooks.
The third study this article draws on was part of a wider Canada SSHRC funded pro-
ject, Community Arts Zone. My research within this project sought to understand chil-
dren's emplaced meaning making through den building. In this study, two of the parents
involved in the previous studies acted as a research advisory group, advising on the
direction of the project. In addition, these parents also collected data (fieldnotes and
video footage) during some of the den building events and analysed the data through a
series of group meetings. Once again we were accompanied by some of our children,
aged between 10 months and 6 years, at some of the den building events. Table 1 sum-
marises the parent-researchers and children in each of the three studies, and the role each
parent-researcher played in each study.
The dataset this article draws on has been collected and analysed by both myself and
the other parent-researchers, over a period of three years. It includes video footage, field
notes, annotated scrapbooks of photograph and notes from a series of group meetings in
which we analysed the data. This dataset is summarised in Table 2.
Throughout this research, parents collaborated with me in different ways, at different
times. For example, in the first study, parents primarily contributed to data collection.
The second project expanded on the collaboration, with parents helping to frame the
research questions, and collect and analyse data. In the third project, parents advised on
the research questions and direction of the project, as well as collecting and analysing
some of the data. There are some aspects of the research process which the parents have
not been involved in, in some cases because they don't have time or inclination, such as
reviewing the literature. Other aspects of the research process, such as writing together,
we hope to do together in the future. Overall, the process of collaborating with parents as
co-researchers has been slow, emergent and exploratory, rather than pre-planned. For me
it has been an experiment in different approaches to collaboration. For the parents,
involvement has built up incrementally, as individuals have felt their way into doing
486 Qualitative Research 17(5)
research, whilst deciding how and whether they want to participate. Tillman-Healy
(2003) describes a methodology of friendship, during which the researcher works at `the
natural pace of friendship' (2003: 724), that is, committing enough time, over a long
enough time period, for `profound relationships' to develop. In my research, approaches
to collaboration have developed at the `pace of friendship'; there are ways of working
together now we could not have envisaged five years ago. This way of doing research
involves risk, as the direction of the research is not always predictable and researchers'
own emotions and personal life become slowly more intertwined with the research site
(Finlay, 2002; Kleinman, 2002).

Ethical considerations
Parker (2005) makes the point that research is always a moral and political activity, and
therefore, `fidelity to commitments made during a research event is the space for ethics'
(Parker, 2005: 14, emphasis in original). The implications of this are epistemological;
embracing particularity of experiences, alternative interpretations and `points of impos-
sibility' (2005: 15) and the role of the researcher within the research are starting points
for an ethical practice. The long term, collaborative nature of my research means that the
experiences, involvement and representation of the families in the study are of para-
mount ethical importance. The families all invested a lot in this study and therefore,
`fidelity to commitments made during a research event'(2005: 14) become, I argue, even
more important. In developing an ethical parents as co-researchers methodology, key
concerns included parents' time and ongoing involvement, consent of both parents and
children, and developing an ethics of care (Banks et al., 2013), as ethical decisions were
made as the arose, over long term relationships and in unfolding contexts.
Consent
Christensen (2004) argues for the importance of developing an approach to research
with children that takes account of children's `cultures of communication' (2004: 166).
Within this research, `cultures of communication' for both adults and children were
understood within an ethnographic process of sharing experiences and learning to
empathise with the viewpoints of others (Pink, 2009). Throughout our collaborations,
I adopted an approach of ongoing consent, in which individuals made choices about
the exact nature of their involvement as the project unfolded. For the young children
themselves, assent, by which I mean gaining children's agreement to participate, was
a more appropriate concept than consent (Cocks, 2006; Dockett et al., 2009). For
Cocks (2006), assent is a process of reflexivity for the researcher, and requires ongoing
work and attention to ensure the children are happy to be participating in a particular
way at a particular moment in time. In practice, the children were well able to express
their assent to be involved in the research. For example, children's hunger or tiredness
was often a cue for an activity to end. This relational and reflexive process was one that
involved myself and the parent co-researchers throughout the study. We jointly aimed
to tune in to the children's body language, actions, and words (Dockett et al., 2009), in
order to make ongoing judgements about whether activities should continue, be can-
celled or cut short.
Time, commitment and ownership
Being involved in this research involved considerable time and commitment from par-
ent-researchers over a sustained period. Doing fieldwork with one's young children in
the field and writing fieldnotes is hard work. The small number of parents who have
continued to research with me in this way over a number of years have described the
enjoyment, interest, satisfaction and also increase in confidence being involved has
brought them. Equally, there are many other families who have been involved in my
488 Qualitative Research 17(5)
research for shorter periods of time, or not opted to participate as co-researchers. The
parent co-researchers are, therefore, a self-selecting group.
Banks et al. (2013) describe the nature of ethical considerations in community
based research as going beyond the implementation of abstract rules to encompass
`dynamic, complex and value-based' negotiations, with `responsibilities attaching to
personal relationships' (2013: 263). Banks et al. (2013) therefore propose a concept
of everyday ethics, involving daily processes of negotiating ethical challenges. The
concept of everyday ethics resonates in the context of research with parents as co-
researchers, in which daily decisions, grounded in personal relationships and commit-
ments were and are made.
I have described the particularity of the process of my collaborative research with
parents, with an emphasis on how parents contributed to different aspects of the
research process, and the ethical considerations involved. Next, I present some exam-
ples of the findings emerging from this research, by offering three lenses for under-
standing the process of knowledge production in this collaborative methodology.
Firstly, I describe the importance of emplaced, embodied knowing (Pink, 2009) in the
research findings, and the way in which this offered a counter to propositional notions
of academic knowledge about children. Secondly, I describe the blurring of roles of
parent and researcher in the study, drawing on Fine's (1994) notion of working the
hyphens. This led to an engagement with the subjectivities of what adults can know
about young children. Thirdly, I outline the growing sense of entitlement parent-
researchers felt in articulating their dissatisfaction with pathologising discourses about
parenting and the inherent assumptions these discourses make about who holds exper-
tise about young children.
Emplaced knowing, collaborative research and the
de-centring of academic knowledge
Pahl and Pool (2011) describe an approach to collaborative research with young people
in a school in which the children's different interpretations of the research led them to
reframe their findings. In this case, approaches to collaborative research draw on post-
modernist critiques of dominant assumptions of knowledge as fixed, discoverable and
quantifiable (Law, 2004; Niedderer, 2007; Somerville, 2007; Vasudevan, 2011). In the
debate about what counts as academic knowledge, Vasudevan (2011) appeals for the
importance of `unknowing' in academic research, stressing the processes through which
multiple points of view can come to be known, and `unexpected trajectories' open up.
Niedderer (2007) makes a distinction between propositional, procedural and experiential
knowledge, pointing out that the privileging of propositional knowledge is common in
academia. In contrast, procedural and experiential knowledge are tacit forms of know-
ing, which can only ever be partially communicated in written or spoken language. As
Johnson (2004) points out, collaborative ethnography is multi-voiced; in The Other side
of Middletown (2004) this multi-vocality was realised through the writing process. In the
research described in this article, I did not write with the parents, but multi-vocality is
represented in the importance of parents' tacit, lived ways of knowing about young chil-
dren, which came to dominate the findings of the research.
Hackett 489
Much data collected during the research about children's experiences of places (muse-
ums, parks, farms, the seaside and cardboard dens) stressed the importance of the mate-
riality of the place, which the children encountered through their bodies. Susie's account
of her field notes, given at a group meeting, illustrates the significance of the materiality
of the museum for her 13 month old daughter Olivia.
So she was just walking I think holding hands and doing a lot of crawling, fast crawling. She's
very inquisitive and I think like her brother loves people and just kind of watching and listening,
in terms of what's going on. At the museum, she seemed to be quite excited about grates on the
floor, didn't she?... I think she was captivated by that, as well as the grate being on the floor,
the metal grate! I think she was making noises, or something with her fingers. And I think that's
about all I can remember. (Susie, group discussion, April 2012)
The embodied experience of different kinds of places was central to the concerns parents
voiced about the limited range of places to go with children during the summer holidays. In
talking about the planned trip to the seaside, Leila talked about the chance for her little girl
Lucy (3 years) to experience the sand as being a valuable, special opportunity. Lucy's usual
experience of sand was in a sand tray at nursery, and the group were clear that, as Leila put
it `the sand they play with at nursery is different to the sand at the beach'. The wider context
of the beach rather than the nursery changed the meaning or experience of the sand itself.
The importance of the materiality of place was picked up strongly in the data parent-
researchers collected during the beach trip. For example, Janice recorded examples of
her 2 year old daughter Miriam's embodied experience of the beach. Miriam insisted on
crawling for most of the day on the beach with bare legs (despite normally choosing to
walk rather than crawl). One image which was particularly significant was a photograph
Janice took of Miriam sitting on the sand staring out to sea. She appears lost in thought,
but for Janice, the significance of this photograph was that Miriam had her hands buried
deep in the sand, lifting her hands and running in through her fingers, repeating this
action over and over again.
Building on notions of embodiment as central to human experience, Pink argues for
the significance of emplacement in how people experience the world. Pink (2009: 25)
argues for the need for research that
attends to the question of experience by accounting for the relationship between bodies, minds
and the materiality and sensoriality of the environment.
Hultman and Lenz Taguchi (2010) critique the emphasis post structuralism has placed on
language and discourse aspects of experience, leading to the creation of human/non-
human binaries. Humans and the material environments are seen instead as `performa-
tive mutually intra-active agents' (Barad, in Hultman and Lenz Taguchi, 2010: 527,
emphasis in original), with agency emerging from the interaction between them. In their
fieldnotes, parent-researchers were pre-occupied with the sand on the beach, and grates
in the floor, and the ways these were experienced through fingers and knees. This privi-
leging of the material and the embodied by parent-researchers in the study is related to
the kinds of knowledge being drawn on through this methodology, and particularly the
tacit and relational ways in which parents know their children.
490 Qualitative Research 17(5)
An interest in how children's bodies experience place was mirrored in the parent-
researchers' own experiences of being in places with their young children, whilst carry-
ing out fieldwork. Doing research with young children was frequently a physically
demanding experience, involving carrying, lifting, pushing buggies up hills and running
after small children in busy public places. These physical, embodied aspects of doing
research with our young children were something which all parent-researchers in these
studies shared. For example, in the following extract from my own fieldnotes, I reflected on
these parallel experiences, as I describe holding Tina's daughter Sienna, aged 18 months,
during a field visit.
I held Sienna for a long time, at a height that was awkward, so she could see the models and
reach the buttons. It reminded me of when Izzy was that age. Tina and I stood next to each
other, both talking to Sienna in the same sort of way, saying the same sort of things in the same
slightly high pitched voice ­ it made me think about the way in which I am researching with
people whose lives I am share so much in common with. The voice, the phrases of speech and
the way in which I was holding this heavy little bundle so she could see the thing that was
fascinating her, were all so familiar because I did all this with Izzy. (Fieldnotes, 15 February
2012)
As I touch on in these fieldnotes, ways of knowing about the field began for parent-
researchers in their own bodies, in the weight of a child in their arms, a certain tone of
voice, and in the experience of being in places as parents. As Susie comments
I think you're just used to running around after them and going through the museum and getting
to lunchtime's kind of an achievement isn't it, cos it's tiring at times!
(Susie, group analytic discussion, April 2012)
The examples provided above of data collected in the field and chosen for analysis and
discussion by parent-researchers, illustrate the relevance of emplacement for the parent-
researchers' ways of understanding young children's engagement with places.
Working the hyphens: both parents and researchers
Coffey (2000) describes the relationship between identity and the field as not fixed, but
shifting and re-created during the study. Fieldwork during which I researched children
the same age as my own, alongside parents who also had children the same age as mine,
brought specific aspects of my identity and experience to the fore. During fieldwork, I
was perceived as and enacted an identify that was equally parent and researcher, and as
the research progressed and I collaborated more and more with the other parents, the
lines between parent and researcher became increasingly blurred.
This blurring of roles aligns this research with the work of feminist and queer scholar-
ship which has sought to resist hierarchical separation between respondent and partici-
pant (Tillman-Healy, 2003). Fine (1994) has used the term `working the hyphens' in her
critique of social science researchers' tendency to write about `others' while `occluding
ourselves and our own investments, burying the contradictions that percolate at the
Hackett 491
Self-Other hyphen.' (1994: 70). For Fine, acknowledging the multiplicity of identities,
including the researcher's and the relationship between these self-other identities is an
ethical practice.
Eroding the fixedness of categories, we and they enter and play with the blurred boundaries that
proliferate... these `relationships between' get us `better' data, limit what we feel free to say,
expand our minds and constrict our mouths, engage us in intimacy, and seduce us into
complicity, make us quick to interpret and hesitant to write. (Fine, 1994: 72)
During analytic discussions, my positionality as a fellow parent was frequently refer-
enced by the others, through comments such as `as you'll know yourself' and `it's prob-
ably the same with Izzy'. As I have discussed above, this shared sense of experience and
positionality was embodied in the experience of being in places with children (carrying,
holding, speaking in a certain way, keeping ever alert as to what the children were doing)
as much as conceptualised as an identity category. A focus on the embodied experiences
of children that we were seeking to understand aligns closely with Pink's (2009) approach
to sensory ethnography, in which `sensoriality is fundamental to how we learn about,
understand and represent other people's lives' (2009: 7). Within this understanding of
ethnography, ethnographers are constantly seeking to access experiences of others which
can never be fully accessed. This partiality and subjectivity is described by Pink in her
description of research methodology.
This is not so much the gathering of data that the researcher will take away to analyse, but
rather it is a process of bringing together which involves the accumulation of emplaced ways of
knowing generated not simply through verbal exchanges but through, for example, cups of tea
and coffee, comfortable cushions, odours, textures, sounds and images. By sitting with another
person in their living room, in their chair, drinking their coffee from one of their mugs, one
begins in some small way to occupy the world in a way that is similar to them. (Pink, 2009: 86,
emphasis in original)
During co-research with parents, two parallel processes of sharing experiences took
place. Firstly, as a group of parent-researchers, we shared embodied experiences of par-
enting during fieldwork, and through this understood or `occupied' each other's worlds
in a deeper way. Secondly, through research seeking to understand the experiences of our
young children, we as a group of parent-researchers began to imaginatively empathise
(Pink, 2009) with the emplaced experiences of the children themselves. Much of this
imagining produced subjective statements about our children's everyday lives. One such
example was Janice's discussion of Natasha and Miriam's experiences in the park. She
described how `Natasha really likes holding ladybirds in her hand, but it's not just seeing
them in her hand, it's the feel of their legs, I realise that now'. In this statement, Janice
makes a claim to know about the feel of a ladybird's legs on her child's hand, and states
her belief of the centrality of this embodied sensation to the importance of the trip to the
park for Natasha.
In her discussion of methodological paradigms for researching multisensorily, Dicks
(2014) makes the distinction between the interest in `looking, listening and touching' of
multimodality and ethnomethodology, and the `seeing, hearing and feeling' (2014: 667)
492 Qualitative Research 17(5)
with which sensory ethnography is concerned. In attempting to understand inner experi-
ences which may not be observable through external actions, Pink engages with the
subjectivities of others' experiences. As Dicks (2014) points out, such ways of knowing
are not accessible through `discursive representations (such as maps, texts, models,
inscriptions) that suspend emplaced, moving, being-in-time and therefore abstract from
the flow of experience.' (2014: 667).
The distinction between discursive and non-discursive ways of knowing and repre-
senting takes on a new significance in research with very young children. While phe-
nomenologically, it is perhaps not possible for anyone to truly understand the experiences
of any other one (Dicks, 2014), at least in sensory ethnographic research with adults,
participants can produce discursive representations to supplement researcher's sensory
participation. In addition, a researcher's interpretations of the experiences of adults or
older children can be checked and discussed with participants themselves. Children aged
under three years are unlikely to answer direct interview questions, may not be writing
or drawing representationally, are perhaps too young to use a camera (Hackett, 2014).
Therefore, the non-discursive and subjective may take on a new significance in terms of
how researchers can understand young children's worlds.
Following her description of ladybird feet, Janice went on to comment
I do keep thinking more now about the idea that your child is taking something from every
experience. Like I was in the park the other day with Natasha and we were looking at the clouds
and looking for shapes in them, and usually I wouldn't think anything of that, it's just something
that we are doing, but I was thinking this time, yes she is learning from this. (Janice, group
analytic discussion, August 2012)
During this research, parents' interpretations of the meaning of experiences they and
their children were having in their everyday lives were shifting. At the same time, as co-
researchers, parents were attempting to engage with and articulate these shifting, emer-
gent interpretations. Being co-researchers positioned parents in ways that enabled them
to articulate these ways of knowing, and validated them.
De-pathologising parenthood and childhood: engaging
critically with parenting discourses
Being parent-researchers involved careful looking and paying attention to children for a
different reason (doing research) and making permanent records (video, fieldnotes,
scrapbooks) of moments and incidences which are usually fleeting and given little atten-
tion. Some examples of these fleeting and often overlooked moments have been pre-
sented above; grains of sand running through fingers, the grimace meant to indicate a
`big smile', the feel of ladybird's legs. As discussed above, making records of these
things required effort and commitment; it is challenging to parent, observe and record all
at the same time. However, the lens of research and creation of field records offered
parents new ways of knowing and talking about their children's experiences.
Transformations in how parents viewed or interpreted their children's behaviour were
strongly articulated by the parents during analytic discussions.All parents were surprised
Hackett 493
when looking back over their data by how much was there, and how much their children
seemed to have done and learned during the field visits.
But it's, it seems now she got out probably more than what I thought she'd got out of it. And it's
interesting because it makes you more aware by making the notes versus doing a trip
independently, and yeah they've been to the museum and they've had a nice time, you know,
played with a couple of things. Makes you, I suppose, analyse and realise that they do actually
get quite a lot out of these things that they do and things that they look at, makes you a bit more
aware I suppose. (Susie, group analytic discussion, April 2012)
One particularly striking example of this is Janice's interpretations of her daughter
Miriam's quiet, reserved behaviour. The way in which Janice interpreted and gave mean-
ing to Miriam's non-verbal communicative modes changed during the course of her
involvement as a co-researcher. At the beginning of the research in 2012, Janice felt that
Miriam would be too young to get anything out of a museum visit for some time, and her
fieldnotes from our museum visit reflected this.
We started off with the room that had the pheasant. At this point she didn't show any particular
interest in the contents of that room.
We then went into the room that housed Nelson the lion. She had a brief ride on the rocking
zebra. She didn't show any overt reaction to Nelson, but her gaze at him was intent. (Janice's
fieldnotes, February 2012)
Miriam was reserved during the museum visit, and verbally quiet. Initially for Janice,
Miriam's silence and reserve in the museum was a sign that she was not learning or par-
ticularly engaged during the visit. However, during group analytic discussions a few
months later, Janice commented
I picked up from your [author's] notes, just like the non-verbal communication, you know like
the leaning towards something, you know even if she's in arms, she sort of, you know, leaning
towards something to get something. And it's funny cos when we're at home and when it comes
to feeding, changing, anything it's all non-verbal, you know as a mum you pick up what your
kid's saying. So I don't know why I didn't link when we go out, to learning, that's why I never
thought she would benefit from the museum initially, I just thought what's an 18 month-old
going to do? (Janice, April 2012)
For Janice, reflecting on and analysing her observations of her daughter, and reading my
fieldnotes of the same visit, led her to reinterpret the meaning of her daughter's behav-
iour, from disengaged, to rich non-verbal communication which parallels the way Miriam
makes her needs known at home. The parents in my research wanted to keep copies of
the fieldnotes and the scrapboooks because, they said, `they are important'. Loizou
(2013) and Liebenberg (2009) both describe how for the parents in their studies, reflect-
ing on the challenges of parenting from the perspective of research helped them to think
about issues in a new way. For me, understanding Janice's evolving interpretations of her
daughter's behaviour, alongside my own fieldnotes, gave a richer and more nuanced
494 Qualitative Research 17(5)
understanding of Miriam's multimodal meaning making and emplaced engagement at
the museum in a wider context of home and family.
In Tillman-Healy's (2003) research, the space for participants to tell their stories and
think about identities through the production of written texts helped towards self-
understanding and acceptance. The space and permanency of the field records offered
parents in my study the opportunity to make sense of their own and their children's expe-
riences in new ways. Over time this led to a growing sense of critical engagement with
pathologising discourses about parents, particularly mothers, and particularly mothers
from poor communities (Clarke, 2006; Gillies, 2007). During Community Arts Zone, in
which parents acted as a research advisory board, analytic discussions turned increas-
ingly from understanding our own children's experiences to commentary on early-years
pedagogy and political discourse. In this way, the fracture lines between the epistemo-
logical understandings of knowledge embraced by this research (for example, Vasudevan,
2011), and the assumptions and narratives of mainstream UK early years policy dis-
courses (Clarke, 2006), became increasingly apparent.
Children's Centres have a remit to educate the parents, so you always feel, as opposed to you
knowing your child better than anyone else, that you have to listen to the professionals who
know children better than you know children. And when we did the research with Abi, she kept
emphasising, no one knows your child better than you, that's why I'm getting feedback from
parents. And it does give you confidence, no it does. Because when you first asked me I was
like, uh that's a bit weird, I'm not really qualified to do it, you know. But you are qualified,
you're their mum, you're raising your children. (Janice, group discussion, September 2014)
In the context of teaching critical literacies to young children in the classroom, Jones
(2013) makes the point that issues of power and identity are central to whether readers
feel `any sense of entitlement' (2013: 220) to analyse and critique dominant discourses.
Applying Jones' argument about the need for participants to have a sense of entitlement,
and the role of power and identity in this sense of entitlement, is useful for thinking about
the extent to which working with parents as co-researchers provided a sense of empower-
ment. Within discourses of parenting, parents in general, and mothers in particular, can
often be marginalised (Clarke, 2005; Gilles, 2007). For Janice, the benefit of being a
co-researcher was that `it reinforces your knowledge of your child'. Therefore, rather
than seeing empowerment as a product which could result from my research, I have
found it helpful, following Jones (2013) to see the shift in power and agency which par-
tially came about when parents were positioned as co-researchers, and particularly when
they formed the research advisory board, as a process leading towards a growing sense
of entitlement felt by parents to speak about their own children's learning and their role
as experts in their own children.
Concluding thoughts
In this article, I have described a way of doing ethnographic research collaboratively
with parents in order to understand the lives of young children better. This research is
grounded in an appreciation of multiple ways of knowing, and the significance of
Hackett 495
non-propositional knowledge (Niedderer, 2007) for understanding, or beginning to make
interpretations about, the lives and perspectives of young children. For others seeking to
carry out similar research, exploring the self-other hyphens (Fine, 1994) between
researchers and parents, and adopting a certain kind of epistemological position seems
crucial. Mayall (2000) has described how underlying assumptions about the nature of
childhood have resulted in both a denial of children's right to be heard, and an increasing
tendency for professionals to `tell mothers what to do' (2000: 244). During collaborative
research, parent-researchers spoke about both the lack of fit between assumptions about
childhood and their own children's lived experiences, and their awareness of profession-
als seeking to assert claims of authority over parents. Researching collaboratively with
parents, an approach which attempted to deliberately disrupt the hierarchy between
researcher and participant (Tillman-Healy, 2003), foregrounded different kinds of knowl-
edge (embodied, tacit, subjective), which added depth and texture to understandings
about how young children experience places. A recognition of the multiple ways of
knowing that different adults might bring to understanding the perspectives of young
children, is summarised by Janice, as follows.
The only thing I would say, like you did, and this was crucial to me taking part, was to emphasise
that the parent is in an equal position, if not greater, to be able to speak on observations about
their child. (Janice, group discussion, September 2014)
