Background: Sexual and nonsexual transmission of cytomegalovi-
rus (CMV) occurs, but the frequency of sexual transmission in the
general population of the United States is unknown.
Methods: Using data from 15- to 44-year-old (n  7883) participants
of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­
1994), we examined the association between CMV seroprevalence and
sexual activity markers. Using logistic regression, we calculated standard-
ized prevalence differences (PDs)--the weighted average CMV preva-
lence among higher sexual risk groups minus CMV prevalence among the
lowest sexual risk group--for each of several sexual activity markers (ever
had sex, number of sex partners [lifetime and past year], age at first inter-
course, potential years of sexual activity, ever use oral contraceptives, herpes
simplex virus type 2 antibody, and a calculated composite marker).
Results: Even after controlling for covariates, we found associa-
tions between CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity among non-
Hispanic black [all PDs for sexual activity markers were positive and
composite PD  8.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)  4.0%­13.1%]
and non-Hispanic white women (15 of 18 PDs for sexual activity
markers were positive and composite PD  10.8%, 95% CI  3.1%­
18.5%). We found a borderline significant association among Mexican
American women (13 of 18 PDs for sexual activity markers were
positive and composite PD  3.5%, 95% CI  0.7% to 7.6%). We
found little or no association within each racial/ethnic group of men.
Conclusions: Sexual activity measurably influences CMV sero-
prevalence among women of childbearing age, indicating that congen-
ital CMV prevention messages should include strategies to reduce
sexual transmission of CMV among pregnant women.
WORLDWIDE APPROXIMATELY 0.7% OF INFANTS are born
with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, potentially lead-
ing to permanent neurologic and sensory impairment.1,2 During the
twentieth century, congenital CMV incidence rates remained high
while prevention efforts reduced incidence rates of other congenital
infections.3 Although CMV is a leading cause of congenital infection,
development of vaccines, educational prevention campaigns, and
treatment options for CMV-infected infants continue to progress
slowly.4­6
Reduction of congenital CMV infections requires reduction in the
number of pregnant women acquiring primary CMV infections. Ex-
perts agree that educational efforts such as highlighting the impor-
tance of washing hands after contact with young children should
reduce CMV infection because CMV is transmitted through contact
with infected body fluids (e.g., saliva, urine).7­9 Approximately 40%
of US children acquire CMV before the age of 11 years from non-
sexual sources including their mother (transmitted in utero,10 during
birth,11 or during breast-feeding12) and close contact with others,
especially children.13­16 For adolescents and adults, in addition to
transmission from close-nonsexual contact, CMV can be transmitted
during activities associated with sex including kissing.15,17,18 It is
unknown whether a substantial proportion of individuals acquire
CMV infections during sexual activities, thus it is unclear if preven-
tion messages should include sexual activities.
We previously reported demographic differences in CMV sero-
prevalence and the force of infection in the United States using
data from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination
Survey (NHANES III).16,20 CMV seroprevalence increased by age
(36% among 6- to 10-year olds to 65% among 40- to 49-year olds),
was higher in women than men and it was lower among non-
Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Ameri-
cans.16 This article continues this work by assessing the association
between CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity markers among 15-
to 44-year-old NHANES III participants.

Among individuals selected to participate in NHANES III, 73%
agreed to the examination. We tested sera from NHANES III
participants for CMV-specific-IgG, using an enzyme linked im-
munosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure, at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.16 We used the Triturus robot
(Grifols USA, Inc., Miami, FL) with SeraQuest ELISA reagents
(Quest International, Inc., Miami, FL) and validated the perfor-
mance of the SeraQuest test with VIDAS ELISA (bioMe
´rieux,
Durham, NC).
To assess the relationship between these serologic results and
sexual activity markers, we included 15- to 44-year-old NHANES
III participants who had serum available for CMV testing (95% of
examined participants). Data were also available for NHANES III
participants 6 to 14 years old (CMV seroprevalence) and 12 to 14
years old [herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) seroprevalence]
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nh3data.htm). The
study protocol was approved by ethics review boards at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University, and
University of Florida.
Sexual Activity Markers
We obtained information on participant's sexual activities from
the questionnaire and laboratory examinations. We defined cate-
gories of sexual activity markers differently by age and gender
because (a) the NHANES III questionnaire content differed by age
and gender and (b) strong associations existed between sexual
activity and age and gender in our preliminary analysis and in
previous studies.23,24
Participants 15 years old were asked about their sexual activ-
ities. For participants 15 to 44 years old, the NHANES III dataset
contained serologic results for a sexually transmitted infection
(STI) (HSV-2 glycoprotein gG-2 antibody)25 and 3 self-reported
sexual activity markers (ever had sexual intercourse, age at first
sexual intercourse, and potential years of sexual activity). We
restricted analysis of ever had sexual intercourse to 15- to 19-year
olds because few older participants reported never having sexual
intercourse. We categorized age at first intercourse, collected as a
continuous marker, into approximate quartiles. We calculated po-
tential years of sexual activity by subtracting age at first inter-
course (years) from age at interview (years).
Additional markers (number of lifetime and past-year sexual
partners) were available for individuals 17 to 44 years old; for
these continuously collected markers we created quartile catego-
ries. Also women reported whether they ever used oral contracep-
tives.
We created a composite sexual activity marker using the sexual
activity markers described above except HSV-2. We restricted
analysis of the composite marker to 17- to 44-year olds because
several sexual activity markers were not assessed among 15- to
16-year olds. For each sexual activity marker, we assigned a value
of 1 to the lowest category of sexual activity and a value of 0 to the
other categories. We summed these values across the sexual ac-
tivity markers, yielding a score of 0 to 4 for men and 0 to 5 for
women, and grouped the composite marker by number of variables
in the lowest risk category: high risk  0, intermediate risk  1,
and low risk 1 variable in the lowest category of sexual activity.
We calculated the composite variable in 2 additional ways for
sensitivity analyses: without the use of oral contraceptives for
women (i.e., identical to men) and with HSV-2 for both genders.
Potential Confounders
Based on a priori information, we identified demographic vari-
ables (race/ethnicity, gender, age, family size, census region, coun-
try of origin, and education level) and children in the home as
potential confounders.15,16 We categorized demographic variables
similar to our previous analysis,16 with the following modifica-
tions: we assessed age in 1-year categories and we combined 2
categories of family size (1 person and 2­4 people).
The presence of children in participant's homes was not directly
provided in the NHANES III dataset. For 15- to 44-year-old
participants (n  9705), we assessed (72%) and inferred (9%)
whether children were present. In some families, all members
participated in NHANES III; among these 4180 participants we
observed family members' ages. An additional 2784 participants
responded to a version of the questionnaire where the presence of
children younger than 17 years in the home was clear. For the
remaining 2741 participants, we inferred that those reporting a
family size 6 had children (n  832), those reporting a family
size of 2 and a spouse did not have children (n  87), and made
no inferences for the other 1822 participants. Characteristics were
similar for participants for whom child status was and was not
inferred. Because we could not control for the presence of children
in the entire NHANES III population, we restricted analyses to the
81% of participants for whom child status was recorded or inferred
(n  7883).
Statistical Analysis
We used SUDAAN software version 9.0 (RTI International)27 to
account for the sample design and incorporate sampling weights,
allowing estimates to represent the US population.22,28 Early in the
analysis, we detected effect measure modification of sexual activ-
ity and CMV seroprevalence between age, race/ethnicity, and
gender strata. Thus, we stratified analyses by 10-year-age groups,
race/ethnicity, and gender.
For each marker of sexual activity, we used both age-adjusted
(1-year-age categories) and multivariate (a priori selected covari-
ates) logistic regression to estimate the association between sexual
activity and CMV seroprevalence. In multivariate logistic regres-
sion, we combined categories of covariates to avoid small cells in
7 of the 18 age-race/ethnicity-gender strata.
Using predicted marginals,27,29 we calculated prevalence esti-
mates, standardized prevalence differences (PDs) (the standardized
prevalence among higher sexual risk groups minus the prevalence
for low sexual risk30), and 95% confidence intervals. We chose
standardized PDs instead of prevalence ratios (PR) to facilitate
comparisons between strata with diverse seroprevalence estimates.
For example, comparing seroprevalence estimates between high
and low sexual risk groups (e.g., 80% and 60% among non-
Hispanic blacks and 60% and 40% among non-Hispanic whites)
represents a 20% PD. Using PR, however, would inadvertently
show a greater influence of sexual activity in non-Hispanic whites
(PR  1.5) than non-Hispanic blacks (PR  1.3).
Additionally, we analyzed the association between HSV-2 se-
roprevalence and sexual activity (ever had sex and composite
sexual activity markers). We used this analysis to compare the
association between sexual activity and CMV seroprevalence with
the association between sexual activity and a virus predominately
transmitted sexually.
Results
Among 16-year olds, approximately 50% reported ever having
sex increasing to almost 100% of 24-year olds. Among 17- to
44-year olds, the median reported number of lifetime sex partners
was 7 among men and 3 among women. In age-adjusted and
multivariate analyses, we found similar results for the association
between CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity markers, thus

only multivariate results are shown. Similar results were also found in
the subset of participants who did not have children in the home.
Individual Sexual Activity Markers
The association between CMV seroprevalence and reporting ever
having sex differed by gender and race/ethnicity (Table 1). We found
a significant PD comparing women who reported "ever had sex" to
women who reported "never had sex" among non-Hispanic blacks.
CMV seroprevalence was higher among non-Hispanic white and
Mexican American women who reported having sex compared with
those who did not report having sex.
Among 15- to 44-year olds, the association between CMV
seroprevalence and the sexual activity markers differed by age-
race/ethnicity-gender (Fig. 1). Among non-Hispanic black women,
all PDs were positive (Fig. 1A). Among non-Hispanic white
women, we found positive PDs for most of the markers studied.
Among Mexican American women, we found fewer positive PDs
and many estimates close to 0. We compared the number of
positive PD estimates for the 3 age groups and 6 sexual activity
markers (a total of 18 PD estimates for each race/ethnicity cate-
gory) and found a higher number of positive PD estimates among
non-Hispanic black women compared with women of other race/
ethnicities (18 of 18 vs. 28 of 36, P  0.017).
Among men, nearly all PDs were positive among non-Hispanic
blacks, but many confidence intervals included 0 (Fig. 1B). We found
little or no association between CMV seroprevalence and sexual
activity among non-Hispanic white or Mexican American men. We
compared the number of positive PD estimates for the 3 age groups
and 5 sexual activity markers (a total of 15 PD estimates for each
race/ethnicity category) and found a higher number of positive PD
estimates among non-Hispanic black men compared with men of the
other race/ethnicities (14 of 15 vs. 19 of 30, P  0.031).
Composite Sexual Activity Marker
Among 17- to 44-year olds, each category of the composite
sexual risk marker separated the individual sexual activity markers
well. For example, the median reported number of lifetime sex
partners increased across categories of composite sexual risk (low,
intermediate, high): 1, 3, 5 among women and 2, 6, 14 among men.
Similarly, HSV-2 seroprevalence increased by category of com-
posite sexual risk: among women (17.6%, 25.9%, 37.8%) and
among men (8.6%, 16.0, 21.9%).
We found similar results for the association between CMV
seroprevalence and the composite sexual activity marker regard-
less of the inclusion of HSV-2 or use of oral contraceptives
(women only). Thus results are shown for our primary analysis:
composite marker calculated without HSV-2 and with the use of
oral contraceptives among women. Within each age stratum of
non-Hispanic black women, CMV seroprevalence increased by
category of sexual risk (Table 2). PD estimates, the weighted
average of high and intermediate sexual risk minus low sexual risk,
were similar across age categories. The association was statisti-
cally significant when all ages were included.
Within each age stratum of non-Hispanic white women, we
found the lowest CMV seroprevalence estimate in the low sexual
risk category and the highest CMV seroprevalence estimate in the
high sexual risk category (Table 2). The magnitude of the PD
varied by age, but the association between sexual activity and
CMV seroprevalence was consistently positive (Table 2). The
association was statistically significant among 25- to 34-year olds
and when all ages were included.
Among Mexican American women, we observed little differ-
ence in CMV seroprevalence with increasing category of sexual
risk (Table 2). We found a negative seroprevalence difference in
the 17- to 24-year stratum, but we observed increasingly positive
seroprevalence differences with increasing age (Table 2). Among
ages 17 to 44 years, we found a small, borderline significant PD.
Among men, we found little or no association between CMV
seroprevalence and the composite sexual activity marker (Table 2).
When compared with a predominately sexually transmitted vi-
rus among women, prevalence estimates for CMV were generally
10% to 60% higher than prevalence estimates for HSV-2 (Fig. 2).
HSV-2 seroprevalence among 15- to 16-year-old women who
reported they never had sex was 5% and 4% to 16% among those
who reported having sex (Fig. 2).
Conclusions
Even after controlling for several potential confounders, we found
sexual activity was associated with CMV seroprevalence in the gen-
eral population of the United States. This suggests that sexual activ-
ities were an important source of CMV infections for women of
childbearing age and should be a focus of prevention efforts. Because
women acquiring primary CMV infections from sexual activities are
also at risk of becoming pregnant, CMV infections acquired during
sexual activity may lead to congenital infections.15
Our finding that CMV seroprevalence and sexual activities were
most clearly associated among non-Hispanic blacks was consistent

with higher rates of several STIs (e.g., HSV-2, chlamydia, gonor-
rhea, and human immunodeficiency virus) among non-Hispanic
blacks than among non-Hispanic whites with similar sexual pro-
files.23,25,31 Reasons for the clearer association between CMV and
sexual activity among non-Hispanic blacks could not be investi-
gated in this study. For some STIs (e.g., chlamydia and gonorrhea),
data support several potential explanations, such as racial/ethnic
differences in sexual partner selection (including partner sexual
risk and race/ethnicity) and differences in vaginal flora.32­35 These
factors may also influence CMV transmission. From the limited
information available in NHANES III, household income group
did not appear to be an important confounder (data not shown).
Consistent with findings for other STIs,25,36,37 we found stronger
associations between CMV seroprevalence and sexual activity
among women than among men. Possible explanations for the
disproportionate burden of STIs among women include biologic
differences and partner selection. For example, some STIs are
more efficiently transmitted from male-to-female than from fe-
male-to-male, perhaps from higher viral concentrations in semen
than in cervical secretions.36,38 Additionally, women may be more
likely than men to have a sexual partner with a STI.37
Our estimation of the association between CMV seroprevalence
and sexual activity was likely an underestimate for several reasons.
First, there is risk of sexual transmission of organisms within the
groups we defined as "low sexual risk," illustrated by HSV-2
seroprevalence estimates above zero among the low sexual risk
groups (Fig. 2). Second, there was likely risk of sexual transmis-
sion among individuals 17 years old (whose risk could not be
assessed with the composite marker), illustrated by HSV-2 sero-
prevalence estimates above zero among 15- to 16-year olds who
reported having sex (Fig. 2). Third, many sexual activity markers
were self-reported and probably influenced by recall, societal

pressures, and interpretation of the questions. This likely nondif-
ferential misclassification of sexual risk would bias our estimates
toward the null. Fourth, sexual activities with no or reduced risk of
CMV transmission (uninfected partner or condom use39 ­ 41)
could still place a participant in a category of higher sexual risk
because data were not available on condom use or partner's
CMV excretion.
This study was not designed to assess nonsexual modes of CMV
transmission. The cross-sectional design prohibited assessment of
whether individuals were susceptible to CMV during reported
sexual activities. NHANES III did not collect information about
the participants' childhood exposures to CMV risk factors. Evi-
dence of CMV transmission via nonsexual modes10,11,13 and our
reported CMV seroprevalence of 36% among 6- to 11-year olds16
suggest that many individuals acquire CMV through nonsexual
modes during childhood and therefore are not susceptible to CMV
during sexual activities. For a rough estimate of the percent of
infections acquired from nonsexual activity, we assumed CMV
seroprevalence among 15- to 16-year olds who reported never
having sex was attributable to nonsexual activities. Assuming only
small changes in CMV seroprevalence occurred over time (i.e.,
little cohort effect), nonsexual activities would appear to account
for at least half of the CMV infections acquired from birth to ages
35 to 44 years old among women (Fig. 2). For example, among
non-Hispanic black women, we assumed the 57% CMV sero-
positive 15- to 16-year olds who reported never having sex
acquired CMV from nonsexual sources. Therefore, at least half
(57% of 95%) of the CMV seropositive 35- to 44-year-old
women acquired CMV from nonsexual sources. To control for
close, nonsexual contact with children during adulthood we
adjusted analyses for a rough proxy, the presence of children in
the home.
This study had several important strengths. First, we demon-
strated an association between CMV and sexual activity in 2
unstudied populations: the US general population as a whole and
Mexican Americans in particular. In general, our findings comple-
ment similar findings regarding CMV seroprevalence among con-
venience samples of women attending contraceptive and STD
clinics.17,18 Second, the over 300 participants per age-race/ethnic-
ity-gender strata allowed evaluation of sexual activity within strata
while controlling for several potential confounders, including chil-
dren in the home. Third, we considered multiple sexual activity
markers, including a laboratory marker (antibody to HSV-2). Fi-
nally, inclusion of individuals who reported never experiencing
sexual intercourse allowed partial assessment of the role of non-
sexual transmission during childhood.

SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CMV SEROPREVALENCE
The association between sexual activities and CMV seropreva-
lence in the US population is notable because it was detected with
limited exposure measurements in the presence of competing
exposures to nonsexual sources. When considered with the in-
creased risk of delivering a newborn with congenital CMV
infection among women with STIs during pregnancy,15 our
results suggest congenital CMV infections could be prevented
by reducing sexual acquisition of CMV among pregnant
women, especially among non-Hispanic black women. Further
study is needed to estimate the number of preventable congen-
ital infections and expand upon limited studies aimed at pre-
venting sexual transmission of CMV. In a study among human
immunodeficiency virus-infected women, condom use reduced
CMV acquisition.40 Thus, behavioral modifications (e.g., prac-
ticing monogamy, condom use with new partners, avoiding
pregnancy in new sexual relationships) may reduce CMV in-
fections among pregnant women. To eliminate congenital CMV
infections, however, a vaccine may be required. Nevertheless,
the large number of CMV-susceptible women,16 who have little
understanding of CMV infection or its potential consequenc-
es,42 should be informed about CMV acquisition from sexual
and nonsexual sources.
