Abstract: A study among 1,881 adolescents (52.3% girls) with a mean age of 19.1 years
examined the effects of parental social status upon intrasexual competitiveness. Whereas
females were consistently more intrasexually competitive the higher the socio-economic
status of their parents, males with parents of the lowest socio-economic status tended to be
more intrasexually competitive than those with parents of medium socio-economic status,
and nearly as intrasexually competitive as those with parents of high socio-economic status.
Only among adolescents with parents of low socio-economic status were males more
intrasexually competitive than females. Among males and females, higher levels of
intrasexual competitiveness were related to a higher family income, to a higher
occupational status of the father as well as of the mother, and to a higher educational level
of the mother. Only among females were higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness
associated with a higher educational level of the father. Males whose fathers had only
elementary education had a relatively high level of intrasexual competitiveness. The results
are discussed in the context of the multifaceted nature of human status, and the potential
relevance of intrasexual competitiveness for individuals of high versus low social status.

Introduction
Although it has often been assumed that, in most species, males are more
intrasexually competitive and physically aggressive than females (e.g., Archer, 2006), it has
become evident that intrasexual competition among females is prevalent in many species
(e.g., Cheney, Silk and Seyfarth, 2012; Clutton-Brock, 2009; Rosvall, 2011). In some
mammals, where females are the primary caregivers, intrasexual competition is even more
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

intense among females than among males, particularly among cooperative breeders where
one female monopolizes reproduction. For example, in a 12-year study of wild meerkats,
Clutton-Brock et al. (2006) found that, among females, reproductive success was more
skewed than among males and, concurrently, more aggression occurred among females
than among males. With respect to humans, evidence is increasing that women may be
intrasexually quite competitive and even aggressive (e.g., Bettencourt and Miller, 1996;
Campbell, 2002; Frodi, Macaulay, and Thome, 1977; Geary, 2010). According to
Benenson (2009), women rely heavily on the investment of one partner for provision and
for protection of themselves and their offspring. Therefore, they have to compete
continuously to attract and keep a male partner. Among men, on the other hand, intrasexual
competition is to some extent dampened by the importance of collaborating with other men
in groups. In line with this rationale, Benenson et al. (2009) found that women tend to
accept stresses and strains in their peer relationships less easily than men.
Intrasexual competition among women is not limited to monogamous mating
systems. In a cross-cultural examination, Burbank (1987) found that in polygynous
societies co-wives often compete intrasexually over food and money, over paternal care for
their offspring, and over their offspring's inheritance. In 61% of the 137 cultures Burbank
analyzed, women engaged in physical aggression, typically fighting with other women over
men.
Even though both sexes may be intrasexually competitive, male and female
intrasexual competition differs in various ways. First, reviewing many species, including
humans, Rosvall (2011) concluded that females tend to compete more over high quality
mates than males do. Second, among humans, males tend to be more physically aggressive,
whereas females tend to be more verbally aggressive and ostracizing (e.g., Benenson, 2009;
Campbell, 2002; Cashdan, 1998). Third, among humans, males and females compete--in
part--in different domains, i.e., in the traits that are most preferred by the opposite-sex (see
also Andersson, 1994; Buunk, Massar, and Dijkstra 2007; Dijkstra and Buunk, 2002).
While throughout human history men have competed more in the domains of status and
dominance, women have probably competed more in the domain of physical attractiveness
(e.g., Cashdan, 1998). Overall, when confronted with rivals in romantic as well as
professional situations, women tend to respond with higher levels of jealousy to attractive
rivals, whereas men respond to socially dominant rivals (e.g., Buunk, aan `t Goor, and
Castro Solano, 2010; Dijkstra and Buunk, 2002; Massar, Buunk, and Dechesne, 2009).
Intrasexual competition is quite salient among adolescents, who tend to be very
sensitive to hierarchies and pay close attention to indicators of their own place in the
hierarchy (e.g., Fournier, 2009; Hibbard and Buhrmester, 2010). Whereas individuals may
become more certain about their actual and potential status as they age, young men are
particularly uncertain about their current status and their possibilities of obtaining a high
status in the future. As noted by Barkow (1989) in his seminal book Darwin, Sex and
Status, adolescents are seeking to determine the actual and symbolic groups in which they
may attain a high position. Whereas young women may receive attention from the opposite
sex on the basis of being physically attractive alone, young men are more likely to need
some type of status (e.g., having money to spend, driving a nice car, playing in a rock band,
studying for a high status job) to receive such attention. Intrasexual competition may have
serious consequences for young people, and may explain the higher rate of criminal
activities among young men (e.g., when they realize that they can easily obtain resources in
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

this way) and the higher rate of school drop-out among boys (e.g., when they perceive that
they won't be able to attain high status through education). Some have even argued that
intrasexual competition is associated with the occurrence of eating disorders among young
women, as they aim to be thinner and less fat than other young women (see, e.g., Campbell,
2002; Dabbs, 1992; Mealey, 2000). Indeed, Faer, Hendriks, Abed, and Figueredo (2005)
showed that competition with other women for mates was related to both anorexia and
bulimia.
In the present research, we examined in a large sample of adolescents how
intrasexual competitiveness was related to the social status of the parents. The research was
part of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) prospective cohort
study, which focuses on the determinants of psychopathology. The current research was
primarily exploratory, as different predictions can be made for the effect of parental status
on intrasexual competitiveness depending on the theoretical framework adopted. If, as is
often assumed, intrasexual competition revolves in part around competition over mates, one
would expect women to show higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness with increasing
status of their parents. Whereas men are more willing to "marry down," (i.e., marry with
someone of lower social status), women tend to prefer partners of at least their own social
status. Therefore, among women with a high social status, there is potentially a stronger
competition over mates than among women with a low social status. An extreme example
of this is found in societies with strongly patrilineal and patrifocal marriage and inheritance
systems, where the marriage prospects of women of the highest socio-economic levels are
relatively poor because it is considered unacceptable for women to marry into a lower
socio-economic class, whereas men can marry women of lower socio-economic levels
(Low, 2007).
We did not examine the various types of intrasexual competition that may differ
dramatically between lower-class and upper-class women. For example, research by
Campbell (2002) has shown that extreme manifestations of female intrasexual competition,
such as thefts, assaults, and homicides, are more common in lower and working-class
women than in middle-class or upper-class women. In contrast, discrete, indirect forms of
intrasexual competition may be more common among middle-class or upper-class women.
We focused on intrasexual competitiveness (i.e., the extent to which one views the
relationships with same-sex peers in competitive terms). The predicted higher intrasexual
competitiveness among women from higher socio-economic levels would be in line with
the observation that anorexia nervosa is more prevalent among women from these levels,
assuming that, as Mealey (2000) suggested, anorexia is at least partly the result of
intrasexual competition. Although an early review concluded that there is no consistent
relationship between anorexia nervosa and socio-economic status (Gard and Freeman,
1996), a number of recent, well-designed studies in countries with quite divergent cultures,
including Sweden and Brazil, do show that the risk of anorexia is higher among girls from
the higher socio-economic levels (McClelland and Crisp, 2001; Moya, Fleitlich-Bilyk, and
Goodman, 2006; Nevonen and Norring, 2004). In contrast, men a with low social status
will face competition not only from men within their own social stratum, but also from men
of higher status levels. Therefore, whereas women with a low social status may show a
relatively low level of intrasexual competitiveness because of their options of marrying up,
men with a low social status may show relatively enhanced levels of intrasexual
competitiveness (e.g., Campbell, 2002).
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

One may also argue that for both sexes there will be an overall effect of parental
socio-economic status on intrasexual competitiveness. That is, on the one hand, one might
expect that there will be more competition in a context of scarce resources (i.e., in the
lower socio-economic classes). Indeed, in a experiment among 3- and 4-year-olds, McKee
and Leader (1955) found that, when paired with someone of one's own sex and socio-
economic level for a building task, children from lower socio-economic levels exhibited
relatively high levels of competition in a play situation (i.e., behavior of which the intent
seemed to be to increase or to communicate one's superiority). On the other hand, one may
argue that the higher the parental social status, the more one has to lose in terms of access
to well-paying jobs, prestige, and respect when, for example, one is not able to finish a
higher education. Because losing one's status (in this case the status one had because of
one's parents) is generally an extremely painful experience (cf. Gilbert and Allan, 1998),
intrasexual competition (and probably competition in general) might be more, not less,
prevalent among young men from high socio-economic levels than among young men from
low socio-economic levels. Indeed, in a longitudinal study of adolescents, Faris and
Felmlee (2011) found that among those of higher social status--assessed with network
centrality--the more aggression occurred to same-sex as well as to opposite-sex others,
although those at the very top of the hierarchy showed relatively low levels of aggression.
In human societies, and especially in current modern societies, social status is a
complex phenomenon, and status in one domain, such as intelligence, creative ability, or
prestige may be far from perfectly correlated with status in another domain, such as
income, resources, or occupational level. For example, as noted by Christ et al. (2012), a
fire-fighter or university professor may have high prestige without actually having a high
income or (in the case of fire fighters) a high education. Conversely, bankers these days
have low prestige even though they tend to earn high salaries. In their recent analysis of
data from a nationally representative sample of over 380,000 U.S. workers, Christ et al.
(2012) found that lower occupational prestige was, independent of income and educational
attainment, associated with higher mortality from various causes including cancer,
cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disorders. Although we did not have a direct
measure of occupational prestige, we could examine the relationship between intrasexual
competitiveness and three different dimensions of parental social status: occupational level
of both the father and the mother, educational level of both the father and the mother, and
family income. We first examined how intrasexual competitiveness was related to a
composite measure of social status that was based on all aforementioned aspects (see
Veenstra et al., 2005). Next, we assessed which of the three dimensions drives the effects
of the composite measure.
As noted previously, to assess the levels of intrasexual competitiveness, we did not
examine various intrasexual competitive behaviors and strategies. Instead, we examined
intrasexual competitiveness by using a scale that assessed intrasexual competition as an
attitude (Buunk and Fisher, 2009). This scale was constructed to be gender-neutral and
assesses the degree to which one views the confrontation with same-sex individuals,
especially in the context of contact with the opposite-sex, in competitive terms. This
competitiveness implicates a number of phenomena that have been well-described in the
psychological literature--albeit not in a mating context--including the desire to beat others
rather than to perform well (cf. Van Yperen, 2003); the desire to view oneself as better than
others (cf. self-enhancement; Zuckerman and O'Loughlin, 2006); envy and frustration
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -1026-
when others are better off and negative feelings towards such others (cf. Smith and Kim,
2007; and malicious pleasure when high achievers ("tall poppies") lose face (cf., Feather,
1994). In the scale used here, these phenomena were operationalized on dimensions
relevant to mating, or formulated in mating contexts. There is increasing evidence that the
scale is related to other variables in theoretically meaningful ways. First, overall, the scale
correlates with sibling rivalry, and among women with a lack of agreeableness, and among
men with a high level of neuroticism and extraversion (Buunk and Fisher, 2009). Second,
in a within-subjects design, Cobey, Klipping, and Buunk (2013) found that pair-bonded
women reported significantly lower levels of intrasexual competitiveness (as measured
with the present scale) while using hormonal contraceptives than while regularly cycling at
either fertile or non-fertile cycle stages. This effect remained significant when controlling
for age, length of relationship, and relationship satisfaction. Third, intrasexual
competitiveness as measured with the present scale was found to be lowest among women
of medium height--i.e., women who tend to be most preferred as partners and who tend to
experience the lowest levels of jealousy (e.g., Buunk, Pollet, Klavina, Figueredo, and
Dijkstra, 2009; Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, and Verhulst, 2013). Finally, Buunk et al. (2010)
found that in work situations, intrasexual competitiveness (as measured with the present
scale) was related to jealousy among men in response to socially dominant rivals, and
among women in response to physically attractive rivals.
To summarize, in a large, representative sample of adolescents we examined to
what extent intrasexual competitiveness of adolescents was related to the socioeconomic
status of their parents, including the occupational and educational levels of both parents as
well as the family income. Although the study was primarily exploratory, we expected that
intrasexual competitiveness would be relatively more elevated among female adolescents
from higher socio-economic levels and among male adolescents from lower socio-
economic levels. However, we reasoned that it is possible that, overall, intrasexual
competitiveness would be more elevated among those from the higher socio-economic
levels.
Materials and Methods
Procedure
The TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) is a prospective
cohort study of Dutch adolescents with the aim of charting and explaining the development
of mental health from preadolescence into adulthood (Huisman et al., 2008). The present
article involves data from the first and fourth assessment waves, which ran from March
2001 to July 2002 (T1), and from October 2008 to September 2010 (T4), respectively. The
study was approved by the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human
Subjects. For recent extensive information on the sampling and procedure, see, e.g., Ormel
et al. (2012) and Nederhof et al. (2012). The following procedure is based on these last two
publications. Participants were selected from five municipalities in the North of the
Netherlands, including both urban and rural areas. Children born between October 1, 1989
and September 30, 1991 were eligible for inclusion provided that their schools were willing
to cooperate and that they met the study's inclusion criteria (de Winter et al., 2005). Over
90% of the schools, accommodating 2,935 eligible children, agreed to participate in the
study. Through extended efforts, the final response rate of the parents was 76% (n = 2,230,
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

mean age of the children when recruited = 11.09 years, SD = 0.56, 50.8% girls). Teacher
reports, which were available for 40.7% of the non-responders, revealed that the non-
responders were more likely to be boys, to have a low socio-economic background, and to
perform poorly at school. Non-responders did not differ from responders regarding
associations between socio-demographic variables and mental health outcomes (Huisman
et al., 2008).
At the first wave, the interviewers were university graduates extensively trained in
interviewing skills, in the study background, and in the content of the interview. At T4 the
adolescents had reached the age of 18 or 19, and parental consent was no longer needed for
participation. At this wave, a custom research company (CRC) was hired to recruit and
assess all respondents that had participated at T1 and at T2 or T3 and had not refused
further participation. After participants had given informed consent, the CRC sent login
information for a web-based questionnaire. A gift certificate of 10 was included.
Adolescents who did not respond to the questionnaire within 2­3 weeks were contacted by
telephone with the request to participate. When they still did not respond after several
reminders, or when adolescents could not be reached by telephone, a CRC employee paid
one or two home visits, both announced and unannounced. This resulted in a response rate
of 72% (n = 1,610). Participants who had not completed any assessments with the CRC
were contacted by the research team. These extensive recruitment efforts led to the
inclusion of 271 additional participants, resulting in a response rate of 84.3% at T4.
Sample
The final sample included a total of 1,881 respondents, with a mean age of 19.1 (SD
= 0.60), with 52.3% girls and 47.7% boys) (see, e.g., Nederhof et al., 2012; Ormel et al.,
2012).
Measures
In the TRAILS project, biological, psychological, and social information has been
collected from multiple sources: adolescents, their parents, their teachers, and their peers.
Huisman et al. (2008) provide an overview of all measurements of the first three waves.
The fourth wave was comparable to the earlier waves, with a few adaptations.
Status indicators. These variables were assessed at T1. Occupational status of both
parents was assessed using the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO;
Ganzeboom and Treiman, 1996), which distinguishes the following nine levels: (1)
elementary occupations; (2) plant and machine operators and assemblers; (3) craft and
related trades workers; (4) skilled agricultural and fisheries workers; (5) service workers,
shop and market sales workers; (6) clerks; (7) technicians and associated professionals; (8)
professionals; and (9) legislators, senior officials, and managers. As there were no mothers
who were skilled agricultural and fisheries workers, and few fathers (1.2%) in this
category, this category was combined with that of service workers, shop and market sales
workers.
Educational level consisted of five levels corresponding to the Dutch educational
system: (1) elementary education, (2) lower tracts of secondary education, (3) higher tracts
of secondary education, (4) senior vocational education, and (5) university education.
Monthly family income (minus tax) consisted of nine categories. As the lowest category
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -1028-
contained only a few individuals, this category was combined with the second-to-lowest
category, resulting in eight categories.
Next, we used the aggregate measure of socio-economic status that was developed
in the TRAILS project (Veenstra et al., 2005) by averaging the five indicators of status:
family income divided into three categories (i.e., low income: less than 2,500;
intermediate income: 2,500 to 5,500; high income: greater than 5,500), educational
level of both parents, and occupational level of both parents after standardization. The
lowest 25%, intermediate 50%, and highest 25% of the scores were considered to represent
low, intermediate, and high socio-economic status, respectively. The aggregate socio-
economic status index captured 61.2% of the variance in the five items, with a Cronbach's
alpha of 0.84. Missing values (e.g., when there was only one parent in the family) did not
affect the association between the socio-economic status measure and other variables (see
Veenstra et al., 2005).
Intrasexual competitiveness. This variable was assessed at T4 and consisted of a
slightly adapted version of the scale for intrasexual competition developed by Buunk and
Fisher (2009). The original scale consists of 12 items such as "When I go out, I can't stand
it when women/men pay more attention to a same-sex friend of mine than to me," "I tend to
look for negative characteristics in attractive men/women," and "I just don't like very
ambitious men/women." Because this was a sample of adolescents, we omitted the two
items of the scale that would only be relevant for adults (i.e., the items that referred to
hiring an attractive or competent colleague at work). Each item has seven possible answers
varying from 1 = "not at all applicable" to 7 = "completely applicable." Cronbach's alpha
for the current ten item scale was very high ( = .89).
Results
We first examined to what extent the intrasexual competitiveness of adolescents
was related to overall socio-economic status of their parents, and next the relationship to
occupational level as well as the educational level of both parents, and to the family
income.
Socio-economic status. An ANOVA with socio-economic level and sex as
independent variables and intrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a
highly significant main effect of socio-economic status, F(2,1629) = 17.96, p < .001,
partial 2 = .022, no effect of sex, F(1,1629) = .21, p = .64, partial 2 = .0001, and a
significant interaction between sex and socio-economic status, F(2,1629) = 3.92, p = .02,
partial 2 = .005. As shown in Figure 1a, overall the level of intrasexual competitiveness
was higher as the socio-economic level of the family in which one grew up was higher, but
this applied particularly to women: The post-hoc LSD tests among women showed that all
three levels differed significantly from each other (ps < .008). However, among men, the
post-hoc LSD tests showed that only the highest and medium level of socio-economic
status differed significantly from each other (p < .001), but that the medium socio-
economic level did not differ significantly from the lowest level (p = .39), and the high
socio-economic level only marginally differed from the lowest level (p = .06). Thus, both
men and women who came from families with a higher socio-economic status were the
most intrasexually competitive. However, whereas women were consistently more
intrasexually competitive the higher the socio-economic status of their parents, men who
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -1029-
came from families with the lowest socio-economic status tended to be as intrasexually
competitive as those who came from families with a medium socio-economic status.
Nevertheless, they were still somewhat less intrasexually competitive as those who came
from families with a high socio-economic status. Put differently, whereas men and women
did not differ from each other in their levels of intrasexual competitiveness, in the medium
socio-ecomic levels, t(824) = .98, p = .33, d = 0.07, as well as in high socio-economic
levels t(481) = 1.29, p = .20, d = 0.12, among individuals from the lowest socio-economic
level, men displayed a higher level of intrasexual competitiveness than women, t(324) =
2.22, p = .03, d = -0.25.
After these global analyses of the effects of socio-economic level, we did additional
analyses to examine which aspects of socio-economic level were in particular responsible
for the effects (i.e., family income, educational level and occupational status of both
parents).
Income. An ANOVA with family income and sex as independent variables and
intrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a significant main effect of
income, F(7,1496) = 2.13, p = .04, partial 2 = .01, whereas there was no effect of sex,
F(1,1496) = 0.01, p = .97, partial 2 = < .0001. There was no significant interaction effect
between sex and income, F(7,1489) = 1.00, p = .43, partial 2 = .005, and this interaction
was dropped from the model. As shown in Figure 1b, the higher the income, the higher the
level of intrasexual competitiveness. Although it would seem that among men there is a
drop in intrasexual competitiveness from the second-to-highest to the highest income
category, a post hoc LSD test showed that this drop was not significant, p =.17.

income of the parents
Educational level. In the next series of analyses, we examined the effects of
educational level of the parents. These analyses showed that the effects of fathers'
educational levels were quite different from the effects of mothers' educational levels. An
ANOVA with the educational level of the mother and sex as independent variables and
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

intrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a highly significant main
effect of educational level of the mother, F(4,1610) = 10.68, p < .001, partial 2 = .026, but
again there was no effect of sex, F(1,1610) = .09, p = .77, partial 2 = .0001. There was no
significant interaction between sex and educational level, F(4,1606) = 1.18, p = .32, partial
2 = .003, and this interaction was therefore dropped from the model. As shown in Figure
2a, the higher the educational level of the mother, the higher the level of intrasexual
competitiveness among both men and women. Thus, the educational level of the mother did
not seem to drive the different effects of socio-economic level for men and women.
An ANOVA with educational level of the father and sex as independent variables
and intrasexual competition as the dependent variable also showed a highly significant
main effect of educational level, F(4,1422) = 11.91, p = <.0001, partial 2 = .032, no effect
of sex, F(1,1422) = 1.04, p = .31, partial 2 = .0007, and a significant interaction effect
between sex and educational level, F(4,1422) = 2.36, p = .05, partial 2 = .007. This
interaction effect (see Figure 2b) was in part similar to that of overall socio-economic level
(see Figure 1a), suggesting that the educational level of the father in particular drove the
effects of socio-economic level. That is, the effect of fathers' educational level was
considerably weaker among men than among women. A separate ANOVA among women
showed a highly significant effect of fathers' educational level, F(4,773) = 11.60, p <
.0001, partial 2 = .057, and 8 out of 10 post hoc LSD contrasts were significant (ps  0.5).
As shown in Figure 2b, among women there was a clear linear and steep effect of
educational level of the father: The higher the father's educational level, the higher his
daughter's level of intrasexual competitiveness. In contrast, a separate ANOVA among
men showed a significant, but not very strong effect of fathers' educational level, F(4,649)
= 2.55, p = .04, partial 2 = .015. Only 2 out of 10 post hoc LSD contrasts were
significant--the contrast of university education with the two tracks of high school
education (ps < .01)--whereas the contrast between university education and elementary
education was not significant. Thus, men with a father who had a high school education
had a lower level of intrasexual competitiveness than men whose father had a university
education, but men whose father had only elementary education did not differ in intrasexual
competitiveness from men whose father had a university education.
Next, we examined whether the effects of fathers' and mothers' educational levels
were independent of each other. Assortative mating with respect to education was evident
from the positive correlation between the education of the mother and the education of the
father (Spearman r = .58; n = 1844; p < .0001). An ANOVA examining the effects of both
fathers' and mothers' educational level on the level of intrasexual competitiveness among
men showed that neither the educational level of the mother, F(4,636) = 0.71, p = .59,
partial 2 = .004, nor that of the father, F(4,636) = 1.05, p = .38, partial 2 = .007, had a
significant effect, in part due to the high correlation between the two variables. In contrast,
when examining female intrasexual competitiveness, we found a significant effect of
fathers' educational level, F(4,759) = 4.78, p = .001, partial 2 = .025, but not of mothers'
educational level, F(4,759) = 1.29, p = .27, partial 2 = .007, confirming again the
important effect of one's father's education on intrasexual competitiveness among women.

Occupational status. Finally, we performed a series of similar analyses for the role
of occupational status. These analyses showed that the effects of fathers' occupational
status were quite similar to the effects of mothers' occupational status. An ANOVA with
occupational status of the mother and sex as independent variables and intrasexual
competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a significant main effect of occupational
status of the mother, F(7,1258) = 3.63, p = .001, partial 2 = .02, and no effect of sex,
F(1,1258) = .001, p = .91, partial 2 < .0001. The interaction effect between sex and
occupational status was not significant either, F(7,1251) = 1.28, p = .26, partial 2 = .007,
and this interaction was therefore dropped from the model. Thus, the occupational status of
the mother affected men and women to a similar degree. As shown in Figure 3a, the higher
the occupational status of the mother, the higher the level of intrasexual competitiveness.
An ANOVA with occupational status of the father and sex as independent variables
and intrasexual competitiveness as the dependent variable showed a highly significant main
effect of occupational status, F(7,1358) = 5.81, p < .0001, partial 2 = .029, with no effect
of sex, F(1,1358) = .02, p = .90, partial 2 < .0001. Again, the interaction effect between
sex and occupational status was not significant, F(7,1351) = .81, p = .58, partial 2 = .004,
and this interaction was therefore dropped from the model. Thus, also the father's
occupational status affected men and women to a similar degree. As shown in Figure 3b,
the higher the occupational status of the father, the higher the level of intrasexual
competitiveness was.
Next, we examined to what extent the effects of fathers' and mothers' occupational
status were independent of each other. Again, assortative pairing was observed, this time
with respect to the occupational status of the mother and of the father (Spearman r = .43; n
= 1392; p < .0001). A single ANOVA simultaneously examining the effect of fathers' and
mothers' occupational status on the level of intrasexual competitiveness among women
showed that neither the occupational status of the mother, F(7,564) = 1.86, p = .073, partial
2 = .023, nor that of the father, F(7,564) = 1.12, p = .35, partial 2 = .014, had a significant
effect (although the maternal effect was marginally significant), in part due, of course, to
the high correlation between the two variables. In contrast, when examining male
intrasexual competitiveness, we found a significant effect of fathers' occupational status,
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

F(7,483) = 2.16, p = .036, partial 2 = .030, but not of mothers' occupational status,
F(7,483) = 0.86, p = .54, partial 2 = .012.

Discussion
In the present exploratory research among Dutch adolescents, we examined the
effect of parental socio-economic status on intrasexual competitiveness, assessed as the
tendency to view same-sex others as competitors in the realm of mating, resources, and
status. We expected that this tendency would be relatively more elevated among male
adolescents from lower socio-economic levels and among female adolescents from higher
socio-economic levels, but we argued that it is possible that, overall, intrasexual
competitiveness might be more elevated among those from the higher socio-economic
levels. In fact, for men we found evidence for both seemingly contradictory effects,
whereas for women we found only support for our last prediction. In general, the findings
provide clear evidence that intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents is directly
related to the socio-economic status of the parents, and seem to suggest two distinct effects.
Firstly, there tends to be a higher level of intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents as
their parents have a higher social status. That is, among both men and women, higher levels
of intrasexual competitiveness were (with some deviations) associated with a higher family
income, to a higher occupational status of the father as well as of the mother, and to a
higher educational level of the mother. This can be interpreted as a status maintenance
effect: Adolescents who grow up in a family with a high social status have more to lose
than adolescents who grow up in a family with a low social status, and may therefore be
more competitive towards same sex others to maintain their high status (cf., Faris and
Felmlee, 2011). Secondly, we found, in line with our predictions, evidence for a number of
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

sex differences: Whereas among women higher levels of intrasexual competitiveness were
linearly and rather strongly related to overall parental socio-economic status, among men
those with parents with the lowest socio-economic status tended to be equally intrasexually
competitive as those with parents with a medium socio-economic status, and slightly less
intrasexually competitive than those with parents with a high socio-economic status. In
fact, although there was no overall sex difference in intrasexual competitiveness, men were
more intrasexually competitive than women among adolescents with parents of a low
socio-economic status. This sex difference seemed to be mainly due to the educational level
of the father, which had a similar effect as the overall socio-economic level. That is, among
women, the higher the educational level of their fathers, the more intrasexually competitive
they were. In contrast, among men, those with a father who had only elementary education
were nearly as intrasexually competitive as those with a father who had a university
education, whereas those with a father who had an intermediate level of education were the
least intrasexually competitive. This sex difference may be interpreted as a differential
status striving effect, and is in line with our suggestion that because men are more willing
to marry with someone of a lower social status, social status will affect male and female
intrasexual competitiveness differently. That is, men with the lowest social status not only
have to compete for mates (and for the status and resources that give access to mates) with
men of their own level of social status, but also with men of higher status levels (of course,
the need to maintain one's status will still result in a high level of intrasexual
competitiveness in this group). In contrast, women of a low social status have more options
of marrying up, and may therefore show less intrasexual competitiveness than men of a low
social status. At the same time, because women tend to prefer partners of at least their own
social status, among women with a high social status there will be a stronger competition
over mates than among women with a low social status. Thus, the curvilinear effect of
social status on intrasexual competitiveness observed in men may be a consequence of a
status maintenance effect in combination with a differential status striving effect.
It is not directly obvious why the educational level of the father and not of the
mother had this differential effect on men and women. A possible explanation is that the
father's educational level still determines the societal status of a family more than the
mother's educational level. Furthermore, the issue arises as to why it was educational level,
and not income or professional status that drove the effects. It may be that, in Western
societies, educational level is the most unequivocal indicator of prestige and is least likely
to be subject to negative societal evaluations in comparison to, for example, income, as
illustrated by the low prestige of bankers these days. Even more so, in Western societies,
educational level may affect the culture in the family more than income or professional
status. Moreover, attaining a higher educational level requires intelligence and persistence;
therefore, a male with a father with a low education may respond rather negatively to men
who are doing better in this respect. It must be noted though that among men, but not
among women, the occupational status of the father had a stronger effect on intrasexual
competitiveness than the occupational status of the mother. This may be due to the fact that
men identify more with their father than with their mother, and that the profession of one's
father is a more observable characteristic than income or education.
The present research has a number of strong points as well as limitations. To begin
with the latter, the sex differences were relatively minor given the large sample size, and
we can only speculate about the processes responsible for the observed effects. In addition,
Parental social status and intrasexual competitiveness among adolescents

we did not examine here the behavioral manifestations of intrasexual competition such as
physical aggression, submission, or derogating one's rivals. For example, Buss and Dedden
(1990) identified numerous strategies of the latter, including derogating a competitor's
intelligence, calling a competitor promiscuous, or dominating a competitor. As noted by
Campbell (2002), forms of intrasexual competition such as violence and thefts are more
prevalent among women from lower socio-economic levels. Furthermore, this research
cannot demonstrate that parental social status has direct causal effects on intrasexual
competitiveness. As we assume that intrasexual competitiveness is a trait, it may follow the
same pattern as many other psychological traits, and be moderately heritable.
Despite these limitations, strong points of our research include the use of a large
sample representative of Dutch adolescents, as well as differentiated measures of social
status. Moreover, this research is the first to systematically study the effects of socio-
economic status on intrasexual competitiveness and suggests that competitiveness with
same-sex others is a robust phenomenon, despite the fact that currently, in the labor market,
men and women compete more with one another than ever before. Whereas male
adolescents from the lowest socio-economic levels may be as competitive as those from the
highest levels, such competition is overall more, not less, prevalent among female
adolescents from higher socio-economic levels. These findings may help in explaining a
variety of processes, including the relative high prevalence of criminal behavior among
boys with low educational levels--assumedly a way to attain status and resources that boys
with higher educational levels may attain through education--as well as the assumed
higher prevalence of anorexia nervosa among girls from the higher socio-economic levels
(e. g., McClelland and Crisp, 2001; Moya et al., 2006; Nevonen and Norring, 2004).
The present research may also have practical implications. It may sensitize
professionals working with adolescents and their families to the important role intrasexual
competition may play, especially among female adolescents from high socio-economic
levels and among male adolescents from low socio-economic levels. Addressing and
moderating intrasexual competitiveness in these groups may help in preventing a variety of
deviant behaviors, from criminal acts to anorexia (cf., Campbell, 2002; Mealey, 2000). In
general, the present research may add to a better understanding of why and how social
stratification in society is maintained, and thus links evolutionary thinking to classic
sociological and social psychological issues.
