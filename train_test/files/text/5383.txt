Background
In September 2007, I came across an online Reuter's article
titled, "Phone credit low? Africans go for beeping." The
article went on to reveal that on a daily basis, approximately
130 million missed calls swarm the circuits of mobile phone
service providers in Africa.1 What is apparent is that a large
percentage of these missed calls are intentional (Castells,
Fernandez-Ardevol, Linchuan Qiu, & Sey, 2006; Donner,
2007; Mckemey et al., 2003). This is a practice that does not
always imply a "call me back" action but is an exercise that
has been developed and perfected by users into an effective
means of communication, with the added bonus of being
absolutely free of costs. These intentional missed calls are
referred to across Africa as buzzing, flashing, miskin, pitiful,
menacing, boom-call, fishing, bipage, beeping, missed call-
ing, and, although the term of reference to intentional missed
calling may differ from country to country, the action is the
same. In Uganda, the country under focus, the practice is
referred to as beeping, and this reference will be maintained
for the rest of this article.
Beeping someone is an action that involves calling the
other user's mobile phone and hanging up before they have
an opportunity to pick up the call. The messages emitted
through this action are usually prenegotiated between users
prior to the action (Donner, 2007), such as "I have arrived
home safely," or "goodnight," or "I'm thinking of you," "I
love you," and even "please call me back." The phone fea-
tures such as the call log and phone book records enable the
receiver to discern who has "called" them. Beeping on the
part of the service providers has created two (among others)
glaring challenges that will be explored here. First, commu-
nication through the mobile phone is supposed to earn the
service providers money whether it is a call or a text mes-
sage. The general idea has been and continues to be that all
communication through this technology is charged a fee. But
how and what constitutes as communication is a constant
power play between the end user and the service provider
because what producers offer does not always tie in with the
consumers' uses of a product2 (cf. Cockburn & Ormrod,
1993; Johnson, 1988; Lie & Sørensen, 1996; Oudshoorn &
Pinch, 2003). The other challenge with beeping is that these
missed calls swarm the circuits, clogging up the communica-
tion channels. Service providers across the continent have
stepped up to respond to this challenge by creating "call me
back" services that are circuited through different channels,
and some of these have been limited to a specific number a
day.3 Not every country though has managed to curb the
practice, and an effort to discern why this practice persists
has instigated research interests that have produced varying
reasons behind the practice.
Even though Africa boasts the world's highest mobile tele-
phony penetration figures in the world, some of the world's
poorest are encountered in the same region (Coyle, 2005) and

I Have to Give an "I Can" Attitude: Gender
Patterns in Beeping Practices
CarolineVictoria Wamala1
Abstract
Intentional missed calling, referred to as beeping through the mobile phone, is a popular communication practice among
Africans.Targeting young mobile phone users in Uganda, this article builds on previous research on beeping, but focuses on
gender as a point of analysis. Data informing this article are based on 76 qualitative interviews with university students and
recent graduates who are currently employed, and the results indicate that beeping practices are embedded in sociocultural,
normative, gender patterns.The data also show that beeping is a multilayered exercise that each individual at some social-
relational level engages in: It is the relationship to the beep recipient that negotiates this practice. Mapping local, diverse
expressions of masculinities and femininity at the intersection of beeping activities, the study offers some recommendations
on how Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in general can be useful signals of understanding sociological order.

the predominant reasoning behind beeping is that the eco-
nomic situation for most Africans has pushed them to devise a
communication practice through the technology that fits in
with their finances (Castells et al., 2006; Donner, 2007;
Goodman, 2005; Horst & Miller, 2006). This article builds on
these debates, specifically highlighting gender performances
through the practice of beeping. Instead of thinking of beeping
as purely informed by economics, this article forges an under-
standing of how the identities constructed in relation to gender
are aided by finances or lack of, and made visible, through
beeping practices. Thus, the economic argument put forth by
some of the previous work in beeping may not be the principal
negotiator of beeping practices, but rather gender.
In this article, beeping is contextualized as a relational prac-
tice, a communicative exercise that is understood by individu-
als who are engaged in some sort of relationship. The social
relationships alluded to here involve class negotiations, cul-
tural negotiations, generational negotiations, intellectual nego-
tiations, economic negotiations, as well as gender-based
negotiations; a cluster of categories that reveal beeping as a
practice imbued with intersectional social orders. These are
enacted on multiple levels simultaneously with an overall
impact on social exercises, existences, and expressions. I return
to a theoretical outline for this article shortly but will at this
juncture reemphasize that gender as a social category is the
focus for this article. Generational, kinship, or class forms of
beeping can be subjects for further research, not to mention the
notion of users being active agents in what a technology
becomes.
To understand who constitutes the 130 million daily
missed calls, this study analyses diverse gender-based nego-
tiations that confront beeping practices. Mapping local, var-
ied expressions of masculinities and femininity at the
intersection of beeping activities, the study offers some rec-
ommendations on how Information Communication
Technologies (ICT) in general can be useful signals of under-
standing sociological order.
In terms of organization, this article is structured as fol-
lows. Immediately following this introduction are the objec-
tives that informed this study. The reader is then introduced
to the methods used before an outline of previous research
related to beeping is provided. The cultural landscape within
which beeping occurs receives mention within the theoreti-
cal outline that is lodged within social constructivist
approaches to gender and technology. Six empirical sections
follow the theoretical discussion, the first section details a
quantitative side of the data that serve as a backdrop to the
subsequent qualitative analyses before rounding up the dis-
cussion with some conclusions on who constitutes the daily
130 million beeps.
Objective
My goal going into the field was to investigate to what level
the economic argument put forth by the literature on beeping
influenced the practice. Having engaged in beeping exercises
myself, I knew there was more to the process than one's
financial ability or lack thereof. I therefore sought to estab-
lish, under what circumstances, how often, and to whom the
130 million daily beeps were directed. Looking at my notes
from the field, and the transcriptions from the recorded inter-
views, I noticed specific themes relating to expressions of
gender, emerging in the data, many of which were aided by
but not altogether overridden by the respondent's socioeco-
nomic status. The objective of this article based on these
identified themes, is to ascertain through the specific prac-
tices of beeping, how gender relations have been affected by
and have affected mobile phone use in Uganda. As more than
70% of Uganda's population is below the age of 30,4 the
study focus aimed at this segment of society can also estab-
lish how modern technologies such as mobile phones have
influenced or are being influenced by the gender structure
in place.
In the field of ICT for development (ICT4D), there is the
understanding that these technologies of which the mobile
phone is a prominent member have ushered in an era of
empowered development (Plant, 1998). Cyberfeminists view
the ICT era as "providing the technological basis for a new
form of society that is potentially liberating for women"
(Wajcman, 2010, p. 148). As the most prominent and fastest-
growing technology in ICT4D, studying the communication
practices with the technology may help answer the question
whether ICTs are in fact liberating women in the developing
regions. McGuigan (2005) asserts that "[i]f you want to
understand any kind of society you should look at how its
members communicate with one another" (p. 47; see also
Bray, 2007, p. 37). Symptomatic to these analyses are cyber-
feminists (cf. Kirkup et al., 2000; Plant, 1998) who allude to
a reembodiment of gender in the cyber realm as mentioned
earlier. Wajcman's (2004) Techno feminism argues differ-
ently as she takes seriously the ways in which technologies
are often framed to distance or subordinate women. Bending
toward this reasoning, this article approaches the beeping
practice with critical interrogations toward how gender rela-
tions are renegotiated, or even subverted through the use of
the mobile phone.
If 130 million beeps circulate the mobile communication
channels on a daily basis, to what extent can this figure be
translated into empowered development? More specifically
who constitutes these beeps, how are the beeps informed,
executed, and perceived? In the process of answering these
questions, this study draws on previous research that has
identified social, contextual rules to the practice that go
beyond cost-saving strategies (Donner, 2007). As such, if
specific rules pervade the practice, additional questions such
as how these rules are conceptualized and maintained will
hopefully be answered. On another register, because major-
ity of the accounts informing the gender and technology field
are from Western experiences (see, Bray, 2007; Mellström,
2009), this article further contributes to the growing body of
Wamala 3
work emanating from developing regions, especially the
meager contributions that come from the African continent.
Method
Limiting the study to Uganda, located in East Africa, this
research is a result of a year of ethnographic observations,
23 conversational interviews, and a subsequent 53 qualita-
tive interviews. The research group relating to beeping was
further narrowed to young adults pursuing university educa-
tion within close proximity to Uganda's capital city, Kampala
because it is the young "urban users" who are "generally
said to be the early adapters of newer communication tech-
nologies" (Berg, Mörtberg, & Jansson, 2005, p. 51;
McGuigan, 2005; see also Katz & Sugiyama, 2006). Second,
the practice of beeping is largely concentrated among uni-
versity students (Castells et al., 2006; Donner, 2007)
although the practice is known to also cut across generations
(Castells et al., 2006). Third, more than 70% of Uganda's
population is below the age of 30 as mentioned earlier.
I refer to the conversations from which some of the data
presented henceforth were derived, as conversational inter-
views (see Dowson & McInerney, 2003) because all the
informants were made aware that the thoughts shared were
being gathered as data for a scholarly article. These conver-
sations took place at informal gatherings, in public transport,
with extended family members, with friends and acquain-
tances with whom rapport had been established (Aull Davis,
1999; Fetterman, 1998). The situations in which I engaged in
these conversations, did not always provide an opportunity
to digitally record the exchange because not only was the
location inappropriate but the natural conversation flow
would have been disturbed if I had stopped to request for
permission to record (for a discussion on this method, see
Fetterman, 1998). These conversations not only explained
the beeping behavior but also helped give cultural meaning
to the practice (Fetterman, 1998). On the occasions when I
had the opportunity of discussing this research with the same
informants twice, I asked for permission to record the
exchange. These discussions lasted anywhere between 30
min to 2 hr.
Building on the observations and conversational inter-
views, I crafted a short questionnaire, which I personally
administered to willing participants. Administering the ques-
tionnaire ensured clarity of the questions posed (Bryman &
Cramer, 2001); it also provided an opportunity to follow-up
on some responses with further questions (Nachmias &
Nachmias, 1996). Meeting these students was done either in
the libraries, outside their lecture halls, at the beginning or
end of a lecture, or, as in one case, when I stationed myself
outside a residence hall. The duration of the interviews with
the students ranged from 10 to 30 min. I took notes as the
respondent answered the questions, making sure to capture
the nuances raised from question to question. The option not
to record these encounters allowed the students to talk freely
at times even read through my notes and provide more infor-
mation. Majority of the students alluded to owning Nokia
phones and as additional material, I also read through 20
Nokia mobile phone manuals--found online--of the more
popular brands in 2008/2009 looking for any mention of
instructions on how to perform beeping.
To establish whether beeping was also prevalent among
young working recent graduates, ages ranging from 23 to 28,
seven willing respondents were also interviewed from an
advertising agency. These seven participants highlight an
interesting class dimension to the practice of beeping that is
intersected with gender and social norms. A qualitative pre-
sentation of data will be used although numerical mentions
will be made liberally throughout the text.
Earlier Research
Castells et al. (2006) present a global perspective on mobile
communication in society and rely on the term "mobile
network society" to amplify social networks built on "wire-
less communication technology" (Castells et al., 2006, p.
6). Beeping receives mention as a last resort form of com-
munication for mobile subscribers that beep the friends and
relatives with the financial ability to return the call.
Emphasis is also cast on the social rules to the practices,
such as the social faux pas performed when a gentleman
suitor beeps his love interest, suggesting gender rules to the
practice (cf. Donner, 2007). Chango's (2005) contemporary
review queries whether the desperate need to communicate
by "the urban poor," who use beeping, does actually make
them members of the information society. Mckemey et al.
(2003) present a technical report that identifies patterns of
telephony use unique to the African region, such as beeping
and the potentials of using these practices as advertising
campaigns to foster greater mobile phone use/integration.
Horst and Miller (2006) in their anthropological study of
the cell phone in Jamaica, encounter the practice as a cost-
saving strategy. In Donner (2005, 2006, 2007), the author
traces the practice across sub-Saharan Africa, and discovers
a social etiquette to the practice. These articles pay the most
social attention to beeping, and Donner concludes in his
2007 article that the practice is more than a "cost-saving
practice," and that it can be categorized into three major
beeps. He identifies a "call me back beep," a "prenegotiated
beep" that involves prearranged messages such as "when I
beep you I will have arrived at the agreed destination," and
"relational beeps," which he notes cut across friendships,
and romantic relationships, which this current article
focuses on with an in-depth gender and technology analy-
sis. Other sources that have informed this study include
news reports such as a BBC article by Borzello (2001),
titled "Uganda's `beeping' nuisance." The article suggests
an underlying financial impact to the practice, with the
financially able users bearing the responsibility and cost of
"the call backs."

Mutual Shaping of Gender andTechnology
Beeping in this article will benefit from the social construc-
tivist framework in gender and technology studies that sees
"technology as both a source and a consequence of gender
relations" (Wajcman, 2010, p. 149). This argument contin-
ues to inform feminist approaches to the field of Science,
Technology Studies (STS), where it is suggested that science
and technology do not "evolve in a vacuum rather they par-
ticipate in the social world, being shaped by it and shaping
it" (Law, 2004, p. 12). As such, feminist readings of STS
seek to problematize the complex relationship women
appear to have with technology as well as the obvious
dominance of men in the field (Lagesen, 2008; Wajcman,
2004). Sociologist, Judy Wajcman (2010) notes that "gender
relations can be thought of as materialized in technology,
and masculinity and femininity in turn acquire their meaning
and character through their enrolment and embeddedness in
working machines" (Wajcman, 2010, p. 149). Among the
youth in Uganda, one can see this mutual shaping emerging
in beeping practices. This co-construction of gender and
technology erupts in beeping as the youth engage with the
mobile phone in specific and structured ways.
Performances of masculinity and femininity (cf. Butler,
1990, who looks upon gender as a performance) "are prac-
tices through which men and women engage in gender and
effects of these practices [consequentially impact] practices
on bodily experience, personality and culture" (Connell,
2005, p. 71). Masculine and feminine practices are varied,
hence the emphasis on pluralized masculinities and expres-
sions of femininity, and are learned and expressed individu-
ally, communally, or even culturally. Analyzing the
dominance or subordinances within and among masculini-
ties in particular, Connell (1987) notes a hegemonic form of
masculinity that negotiates power relations in lieu of women
and other men. The role of provider over a woman is one of
the "prevailing hegemonic masculine ideal" 5 (Kiyimba,
2005; Nannyonga-Tamusuza, 2005; Nyanzi, Nyanzi-
Wokholi, & Kalina, 2009; Sorensen, 1996; Wyrod, 2008,
p. 809) and is a characteristic particularly developed through
oral literature, language, music, dance, and folklore among
Uganda's youth. Not only do these media create "near indel-
ible impressions in matters of social organisation, political
power relations, resource management and sharing, and gen-
der relations, these impressions in turn lay down rules of the
future social behaviour and contact of the young people"
(Kiyimba, 2005, p. 254). Expected social behaviors are made
visible in the games that young boys and girls engage in, the
same are held in check by peers, relatives, the community
"and recently through electronic mass media" (Nannyonga-
Tamusuza, 2005, p. 116-119). I note that both boys and girls
are constructed by and restricted by the local gender system
and are groomed in opposition of each other, which helps
establish relations of codependency (cf. Nannyonga-
Tamusuza, 2005; Nyanzi et al., 2009). When asked if, how
often, why, and whom they beep, all the informants in this
study alluded to being engaged in heterosexual relationships.
As such beeping as a practice fortifies these cultural con-
structs but the same practice also makes visible the iterative
quality of these expressions as well as their fragility.
Forms of Beeping: Results
The implicit economic argument put forth by (Borzello,
2001; Castells et al., 2006; Heavens, 2007; Horst & Miller,
2006; Mckemey et al., 2003) cannot be disputed regarding
the practice of beeping. The empirical data provided hence-
forth are indicative of sociocultural practices among the
young people, perhaps as a minion of economic inabilities.
That said, it was also evident that even financially able
female respondents (e.g., the working advertising firm
female respondents), still beep their boyfriends, with a non-
chalance that suggests an expectant "call me back" situation
in most cases. Far from being a representative sample of the
youth in Uganda, the subsequent numerical depictions are
useful for the ensuing qualitative analyses as they provide
general trends among the informants that provide the
emphasis needed in detailing the qualitative data that follow
this section.
From the 53 participants that informed this study, 46 of
them are university students. Of the 46 students, 26 are
female students and 20 are male students. The questions
listed on the questionnaire first established if the respondent
owned a mobile phone, after which demographic questions
such as age, year of study, and name were also sought.
Thereafter, the respondents' phone billing plan was queried.
This question was essentially posed to establish if economic
factors motivated the practice of beeping. All 53 respondents
(including the working respondents) are on the prepaid
phone billing plan, the choice plan made for the economi-
cally challenged who would want to monitor their expendi-
ture (Skuse & Cousins, 2008; Waverman, Meschi, & Fuss,
2005). Further along the interview, the participants were
asked to choose from a list of features available on their
mobile phones, three of their favorite and most frequently
used. Beeping is not a feature on any mobile phone, and
scrutiny of the manuals sold with each mobile phone do not
list this practice as a feature or supply instructions on how to
go about the exercise.6 Nonetheless, beeping was included
(deliberately to establish if it was considered important)
among the list of features to choose from, and with the
exception of 1 female university student, who questioned
whether beeping was a mobile phone feature, the rest of the
informants either scorned at the feature, or jovially pointed at
it as one of their favorite mobile phone features.
More specifically, 11 of the 26 female university stu-
dents selected beeping as one of their favorite features and
8 men out of 20 male university students selected it. That
this nonfeature is one of the most favored offered by the
mobile phone by 19 of the university student respondents is
Wamala 5
indicative of just how prevalent the practice is among this
group of users. The respondents were also asked how often
and with whom they engaged in the practice of beeping.
About 50% (13) of the female university students beep on a
daily basis, and 35% (7) male university students beep on a
daily basis. From the same group of university respondents,
it was also established that 21 (81%) of the female respon-
dents beep their boyfriends, while 8 (40%) of the male
respondents alluded to beeping their girlfriends. With the 7
recently graduated respondents, all employed, the follow-
ing responses were recorded. Of 4 female respondents, 3
chose beeping as one of their favorite mobile phone fea-
tures, and 1 out of 3 male respondents selected beeping as
a phone feature they favored. Two of the girls from the
advertising agency claimed to beep on a regular basis, and
were quick to point out that the beeping was to specific
people such as to their boyfriend, or family or parents,
never their peers, because "now that I am working I don't
think it is good. When I was in college, it was very under-
standable. I only beep [my friends] if there is a prearranged
message" (Daniella, 24, PR executive). None of the young
working males beeped their girlfriends or buddies. But they
did admit to beeping parents or older family members
whom they knew would be able to call them back.
Comments made especially by male respondents when
asked if they beeped their girlfriends were noted. The
strong reactions toward beeping their partners were mostly
experienced from the male participants, while majority of
female respondents almost seemed to consider the same
practice as normal. To analyze these attitudes and further
deconstruct the data provided here, the subcategories
enlisted below relate to a relational beeping analysis further
contextualized within the construction of gender in Uganda
and among these participants.
Beeping Performances
To untangle the structures that order beeping performances
as shown in the previous section, the empirical presentation
in this section is enveloped in discussions on masculinity,
and how this enterprise is produced through beeping prac-
tices. Seen as a process, masculinity is a relational concern
within gender relations or as Connell (2005) puts it "`[m]
asculinity' does not exist except in contrast with `feminin-
ity'" (Connell, 2005, p. 68). As such bringing masculinity
into focus further makes visible other constructions of gen-
der categories (Carrigan, Connell, & Lee, 1985; Donaldson,
1993) that call various models of masculinity into play
within beeping. The production of masculinity in beeping is
assisted by class dynamics driven by economic resources as
alluded to earlier. As the economic processes vary for infor-
mants in this study, the forms of masculinity are plural in
their production. The strong affiliation between economic
resources and expressions of masculinity provides another
explanation for beeping. As a matter of course, Connell's
(1987) concept of hegemonic masculinity is taken as a point
of departure and is maintained as a central focus in the pro-
cess of analyzing the order in beeping practices. Hegemonic
masculinity to recapitulate is when "particular groups of
men" validate, maintain, and defend their positions of power
over women and other men (Carrigan et al., 1985; Connell,
1987, 2005). In beeping practices, hegemonic masculinity is
called into play through one's ability not to beep but also the
ability to respond to a beep.
During one of my conversational interviews, I was made
to realize how the relationship between masculinity and eco-
nomic resources is the source of specific beeping practices:
While I was at campus this was the case; a guy who is
interested in a girl, will want to show her that he is
capable of taking care of her. And guys like to show
off, so the guy will start buying the girl airtime and he
tells her that she should beep him, and he will call her
back, and when her airtime runs out she must tell him,
he will load more on her phone. So the girl gets used
to this airtime. (Salome, November 2008)
The specific gender relations constructed in the interac-
tion described in this excerpt can be better understood when
the historicity of the gender order (cf. Donaldson, 1993) in
Uganda is considered. If parallels are drawn between the
breadwinning practice and the guy's ability to buy airtime,
and respond to a girl's beep, hegemonic masculinity is con-
ditioned upon and modeled, toward the guy not beeping,
simultaneously encouraging his girlfriend to beep him. It is
imperative for the guy in question to provide the call credit,
which according to this excerpt must never be used to call
the credit provider. This pattern of masculinity, may not nec-
essarily be oppressive to the girl in question, in fact "some
expressions of the hegemonic pattern [may be] more familiar
and manageable" (Donaldson, 1993, p. 645) for women, who
are actively engaged in its production. I discussed some of
the patterns emerging in my data with Salome, whose
insights were very useful in fleshing out the various reasons
many young men in my data consciously chose not to beep.
Responsible Beeping
I came across 20-year-old Richard early October 2008, on his
way to the library, and he mentioned that even though he did
not have a girlfriend at present, he would never beep her
because "I have to show an `I can' attitude," and he followed
this comment with "you know how it is for us guys." Richard
spoke with hand gestures as he tried to get his opinion across.
The historicity of the gender order referred to earlier is par-
ticularly evident in Richard's reference to "you know how it
is for us guys." How society grooms and regulates gender
relations can be reflected on how Richard interprets and
adheres to these regimes. I also realize that I cannot be
absolved of Richard's perception of me and the impact this
6 SAGE Open
might have had on the interview. The "I can" attitude alluded
to may have also been directed at me as a woman. Shortly
after meeting with Richard, I chanced upon 21-year-old
Michael outside his residence hall. When asked who he prac-
ticed beeping with, his disapproval toward beeping his girl-
friend was visible in his facial expression before he stated, "I
would rather send her a SMS, beeping is too `high school.'
It's for immature boys." Michael, however, talked about
beeping his parents claiming, "Oh yes, there is always money
there." This was a clear theme among the informants.
Namely, that the same young men do engage in the practice
with their family displaying that construction of a good son,
in relation to the familial hierarchies of parents caring for and
protecting their children is unlikely to berate a beep from the
son. Whereas the construction of a good boyfriend, within
this category of respondents may be contingent on being
responsive to a girlfriend's beep. Michael's reference to
"there is always money there," with regard to his parents
steers the discussion back to the economic resources that are
central to Michael's beeping practices and depending on the
social arrangements the same can both motivate and under-
mine who Michael beeps or does not beep.
On another occasion, stationed a few meters away from a
roadside phone kiosk on one of the University campuses, I
happened upon 21-year-old Steven. Steven was very chatty,
and when asked who he beeps, his friends and his girlfriend
were not in this category. As a way of explanation to not
beeping his girlfriend, Steven supplied, "beeping doesn't
show responsibility, I must show my girlfriend that I am
responsible!" Steven gave some fascinating alternatives as
opposed to beeping his girlfriend. We were standing a few
meters from a roadside phone kiosk as mentioned already,
and he stressed that rather than beep his girlfriend he would
call her from the public phone, which he gestured toward.
Call charges to mobile phones from one of these public
phone booths are cheaper than direct mobile-to-mobile calls.
This practice has social connotations to the effect, that one
who calls another mobile phone from one of these phone
booths communicates their financial inability to communi-
cate directly from a mobile phone particularly if the call
recipient is aware that the caller is in possession of a mobile
phone. When Steven stressed that he would rather call from
these phone booths he demonstrated his abhorrence toward
beeping his girlfriend and also created hierarchies in com-
munication practices that are worth pursuing in further
research.
Ronald, a 22-year-old, had just come out of a lecture on a
Tuesday afternoon when he agreed to an interview. We sat in
the empty lecture hall and soft-spoken Ronald quietly
responded to my questions with a conviction I had not seen
with some of the other male informants. Ronald disapproved
of beeping in general but with specific reference to his girl-
friend he said, "I have to show that I care about her." I asked
as a follow-up if beeping the girlfriend was an indication that
he did not care for her, he simply nodded.
Beeping Behaviors
The context and the environments in which I met these
informants further contributed to the material at least with
regard to the expressions of masculinity. For example, John,
an advertising agent, sat in an open office with several other
colleagues and this interview could be heard by all who were
present. When we reached the section in my question sheet
that asked about his beeping practices, 25-year-old John
exclaimed "I never beep my girlfriend, she is different." I
asked him what was different about his girlfriend and he
explained while looking around at his female colleagues
"you know how girls are they expect you to call them." And
to his credit, the female colleagues gestured and mentioned
that it was important that a boyfriend calls his girlfriend as
opposed to beeping. Seated a couple of desks away from
John was 27-year-old Ivan. Ivan was a jolly boisterous inter-
viewee who may have also wanted to show off for his col-
leagues in the same open office space as John. As he
responded to the questions, he encouraged the participation
of his colleagues by challenging them with questions or
comments. Although Ivan did not mind his girlfriend beep-
ing him, he took issue with friends or colleagues beeping
him and when he mentioned this, one of his female col-
leagues calmly mentioned that sometimes a call is unneces-
sary when all you want to say is "hi, I am thinking of you."
To this Ivan responded "you might as well call me and blurt
out the `hi' and then hang up, beeping is so unloving."
The environments were themselves highly gendered and
produce varied enactments of masculinities. Alternatively,
the context had an influence on or helped convey masculin-
ity. Ronald John and Ivan put forward the same argument but
expressed it differently. While John and Ivan fed off of their
colleagues, Ronald's quiet conviction if paralleled exempli-
fied different expressions of masculinity, that are still "cen-
trally connected with the institutions of male dominance"
(Donaldson, 1993, p. 645). Put another way, the girlfriends
are a critical aspect in the production of hegemonic mascu-
linity as long as they are the ones doing the beeping. For
example, the female respondents (students and employed),
who alluded to beeping their boyfriends, did not follow their
response to this question with strong comments as noted
above. A case in point is 24-year-old advertising executive,
Daniella, who mentioned that she does not beep as much
now that she is working, unless she is communicating a pre-
arranged message. Daniella and her female colleagues sug-
gest here that as working women, they have to adhere to
specific codes of behavior such as only beeping when they
have to. The same informants claimed to beep their boy-
friends, however, with Daniella providing that "he expects
me to beep him" (January 2009). Even though these ladies
may be in a position to afford to call their boyfriends, they do
not do so. As such when Wajcman (2010) talks about tech-
nology being a source and a consequence of gender relations,
the performance of masculinity, emerging in this category of
Wamala 7
informants emphasizes the hegemony of these men in rela-
tion to women (Connell, 1987). Richard's comment about
having an "I can" attitude, or Michael's comment about
beeping being an "immature" trait for men, along with
"beeping is so unloving," or "I have to show that I care about
her," are comments that demonstrate that if, as a man, you
love or care about your girl you cannot devalue what she
means to you by beeping her (Chango, 2005) or risk the
embarrassment of being labeled as "cheap" (Donner, 2007,
p. 6).
Emphasis is made with words such as devalue and cheap,
to highlight the socioeconomic implications of beeping at the
same time as I problematize the exclusive focus on economic
resources in previous research by making visible the gender
structure that informs beeping. Put differently, the economic
argument that feeds its way into specific sociotechnical prac-
tices is part of "large-scale social structures" (Carrigan et al.,
1985, p. 577). In addition to the earlier research on beeping,
this article argues that beyond the economic argument, the
production of masculinity can be undermined or strength-
ened within specific conventions of gender practices. Each
of the young men in this section have to show that they
"care" about their girlfriends, and their inability to maintain
the relationship could be seen as a loss of their masculine
identification (see for comparison, Connell, 1987, pp. 183-
187; Connell & Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 840; Kimmel,
1987, p. 266). As informed by another conversation
interview,
I had a chat with this guy who was complaining that
his previous girlfriend who was from the [south] of
Uganda was fond of beeping him. He said, "I used to
buy her the airtime and she would beep me only, never
called, so I started wondering--if I am buying her the
airtime, who is she calling with my money? After a
while we broke up and I am now seeing this lady from
the [east] of Uganda, this lady is different, she will
even go to the phone kiosks when she has no airtime,
I don't understand, I have told her to beep me, but she
always calls, is she more desperate than girls coming
from the [south] or what?" (Mary, October 2008)
Several issues are raised in this excerpt, and as mentioned
earlier, the various attributes that negotiate beeping such as
ethnicity as inferred in this quote are topics for future
research. But the idea promoted here illustrates the construc-
tion and expression of masculinity, around notions of power.
This man, encourages his girlfriends to beep him and the girl
who fails to adhere to his ability of assuming the role of pro-
vider, has him pondering whether or not she is desperate, a
trait he clearly finds disconcerting toward the performance
of masculinity. There is a lot of showing off, of being finan-
cially able, and for hegemonic masculinity to emerge suc-
cessfully; women like Daniella have to be compliant in
"accommodating the interests and desires of men," a process
that Connell (1987) labels as "emphasised femininity" (p.
183) meaning that the women are active participants in the
process and production of hegemonic masculinity.
Expressing Resistance
Whereas Donner's (2007) and York's (2002) materials sug-
gest that employees as well as students in this particular case
can beep their employers or lecturers, my data does not
agree with this assessment. The students and the advertising
agents provided very emphatic nos to this question. Both
male and female student respondents did not beep their lec-
turers and the employed respondents did not beep their
employers, suggesting that social hierarchies can renegotiate
the gendering of technology and why a situated context-
specific analysis of sociotechnical practices is important.
Thinking back to Michael's comment when asked if he
beeps his parents, where he reveals "oh yes, there is always
money there," as opposed to him not beeping his lecturers or
girlfriend, one can conclude that masculinity is expressed,
both in situations of beeping and nonbeeping. Hence, within
the family discourse, constructions of masculinity are still
prevalent where the construction of "son" builds upon cer-
tain traits of masculinity at the same time as it dismisses oth-
ers. Similarly the construction of "boyfriend" rests upon and
is reinforced by certain traits of masculinity--caring for your
woman--just as femininity when confronted by particular
rankings in society, may not be an acceptable excuse for
engaging with technology in specific ways.
Other tensions were registered with some of the subverted
beeping performances as in the example of eight university
male students who alluded to beeping their girlfriends, while
five female university students did not beep their boyfriends.
These young women considered the whole practice unfair to
the recipient of the beep. Rebecca in particular was very
vocal on her feelings toward the practice saying "it's a moral
issue I don't consider it proper, like I am detoothing him."
Detoothing is a form of dependency literally meaning to ren-
der someone toothless by deliberately enjoying financial
favors from them with no intention of returning the good-
will. Hence young ladies who succeed in having men lavish
money on them without a capitulation on their part are said
to detooth guys. I contend the same can happen the other
way around or even within same gender relations. For
Rebecca, 22, a 3rd-year university student, she considers this
reliance on a boyfriend to call her back as immoral and a
practice only for the "cheap" girls.
To suggest that the forms of masculinities expressed
among the category of men who beep as well as those who
appear to have no qualms with receiving calls as opposed to
beeps from girlfriends like Rebecca are subordinated forms
in relation to hegemonic masculinity would be a rather sim-
ple conclusion. Rather the power structures that demotivate
certain groups of men from beeping, and encourage others to
beep, may be different but it also shows that the differences
8 SAGE Open
are not just about power--or power may assume a different
character. Put differently, some of these masculinities resist
the established assumptions at the same time as they stabilize
the associated notions of power. The breadwinning position,
shaped by social norms also shapes masculinity, and some of
these norms are made visible through the young men who
express the provider role by responding to a beep. The empiri-
cal material does not delve into how these groups of men
negotiate alternative forms of masculinities, but it shows that
not all men engage with technology in relation to conventional
gender expressions, and certainly not women like Rebecca
either for whom beeping the boyfriend may subjugate her
boyfriend's masculinity rather than qualify it. I return to my
conversation with Salome to help flesh out this section,
Those guys who end up saying "my girlfriend is
dethoothing me," have brought that upon themselves,
you can't start buying airtime and change your mind
along the way, she is not dethoothing, she is doing as
you have showed her. (Salome, November 2008)
It would in fact appear that some men find the require-
ment to respond to a girlfriend's beep, disempowering espe-
cially if they refer to the process as one that detooths them.
Even if it is the men who encourage the beeping according to
Mary and Salome, the power structures that inform the exer-
cise become subverted as women assume greater control and
power over the process. The fragility and process-oriented
quality in expressing masculinity, especially hegemonic
masculinity, is evident in the men who fail to control their
girlfriends beeping and as in the case of Mary's discussion
also the girlfriends calling patterns. The economic incentives
that appear to create the hegemonic pattern in beeping are
not ahistorical. Their construction would benefit from a
deeper examination of what practices sustain them (cf.
Connell & Messerschmidt, 2005; Kimmel, 1987). But it is
noteworthy that the five girls in this category do not engage
in any form of beeping, and passionately dislike the practice.
While on the flip side, the eight men who beep their girl-
friends--an interesting contrast to the women they are being
compared with in this category--noted how it was perfectly
alright for their girlfriends to beep them, but they would also
do (did) the same.
Peer Beeping Practices
Within the male homosocial/male­male circles, an unspoken
tension was communicated on beeping one's male friends.
The notion of responsibility discussed by the male respon-
dents according to their reference of girlfriends was in this
instance put forward as a boyish trait that is not popular even
among their male friendships. As Donaldson has it, "[t]
hrough hegemonic masculinity most men benefit from the
control of women. For a very few men, it delivers control of
other men" (Donaldson, 1993, p. 655). Held in check by
peers, as mentioned earlier, the gendered power relations
among men (Connell, 2009) are amplified in relation to other
men and manifest among the informants in this study in how
they communicate through the mobile phone with each other.
The male respondents were emphatic when they mentioned
that beeping their friends almost always involved communi-
cating a prenegotiated message, such as "I have arrived at the
`agreed meeting place.'" The girls on the other hand did not
communicate the same friction regarding beeping each other.
Beeping fellow girlfriends, just to communicate a "hello"
message was a common practice mentioned by the female
respondents. Some female respondents narrated the number
of beeps required to communicate particular messages and
that it was commonplace to beep friends on a regular basis.
Among the male respondents, 78% (18) in total men-
tioned beeping their friends, most of them following this
with a comment to the effect that a beep had to be agreed
upon prior to its emission. Among the female respondents,
83% (25) indulge in the practice liberally with fellow girl-
friends, without the same tension as communicated by the
guys. One female respondent noted that some of her friends
did not appreciate being beeped so she did not beep them,
but those that did not mind she beeped them every once in a
while to say "hi." This demonstrates that the practice is not
used within all female-to-female relationships, but it is more
prevalent among this group than the male-to-male friend-
ships. This shows that even among their male-to-male social
bonds, there is the unspoken responsibility of elaborating
masculinity. Because as Steven phrased it, "beeping doesn't
show responsibility"; a trait that men are taught very early on
in their childhood. The girls on the other hand, are taught to
emphasize their dependence, (Kiyimba, 2005; Nannyonga-
Tamusuza, 2005) and for them displaying these traits even
among each other, may not always result in their femininity
being compromised, to the level that masculinity is among
the guys (Connell, 1987, p. 186f).
Conclusion
It is highly likely that beeping as a form of communication
will wane as other features are introduced on the mobile
phone. The smartphone revolution has afforded many stu-
dents and Uganda's youth in general with cheaper affordable
communication features powered by Wi-Fi or mobile
Internet bundles. With Wi-Fi services spread liberally at
many universities in Uganda, communication through these
various applications can take place with little or no cost to
the student. But even though the mobile phone may continue
to provide affordable means of communication, this article
has illustrated how to some extent expressions of gender are
changing with the advent of ICT, but to a greater degree, the
gender order at play is reinforced as made visible through
mobile phone communication practices.
Beeping is ubiquitous within the Ugandan society
(Borzello, 2001). The concept has been analyzed by
Wamala 9
researchers with the conclusion that it is not only a nuisance
but is a practice deeply embedded in the socioeconomic sta-
tus of Ugandans and Africans in general (Borzello, 2001).
The current article develops this analysis by emphasizing an
aspect of beeping that has received passing attention in the
published works that of beeping being primarily informed by
or negotiated by gender. This article has not dismissed the
economic aspect put forth by previous research, but has
sought to build on this enterprise by illustrating the con-
scious efforts applied by mobile phone users, to convey their
gender identities when they communicate through the mobile
phone. For example, the pressure, perhaps even pleasure,
and power that young men face when they receive a beep
from a love interest requires a cultural performance of the
local understanding of what it means to be a responsible
man. One also has to understand that the girls' practice of
beeping does not preclude them as passive in the practice
because their interactions with the mobile phone precipitates
the enactment of hegemonic masculinity as made clear by
Daniella's confession. Some of these ideas substantiate the
hegemony of some groups of men that can be paralleled to
the culturally idealized form of breadwinning, an enterprise
that is actively sought by most men. Under the umbrella of
socioeconomic processes, juggling the various positions of
son, boyfriend, student, or employee, for the young men in
this study requires various expressions of masculinity in
beeping as regulated by the social arrangements. Not only
does a mundane (in)significant practice such as beeping con-
tribute to establishing these gendered norms, the practice
through this technology also enables a glimpse of how gen-
der is structured (Bray, 2007) in Ugandan society.
Cyberfeminists have alluded to a Cyberutopia that has the
potential to redress inequalities in societies (Kirkup et al.,
2000; Plant, 1998). A positive way of looking at the 130 mil-
lion beeps is to consider the rapid uptake of the mobile phone
by a region that has for the most part struggled to catch up
with the rest of world with regard to ICT uptake (Polikanov
& Abramova, 2003). But looking at the technology, and the
social and cognitive structures in place, the way technology
is used depends on the subject, and making the kind of jump
alluded to by the cyberfeminists of a more equal society
through technology (especially if a hype is created around
the 130 million daily beeps), may in fact obscure more than
illuminate interactions with ICT. Rather,
both technology and gender are products of a moving
relational process, emerging from collective and indi-
vidual acts of interpretation. It follows from this that
gendered conceptions of users are fluid, and that the
same artefact is subject to a variety of interpretations
and meanings. (Wajcman, 2010, p. 150)
Bray (2007) suggests that "[t]echnical skills and domains
of expertise shape [and are shaped by local] masculinities
and femininities" (p. 37).
As a social symbol of negotiating beeping practices, gen-
der illustrates among this category of informants that the
hegemonic masculine ideal of provider, prevails among
majority of the young men who ascribe to this role by con-
sciously choosing not to beep. In the same vein, majority of
the young women practice beeping in line with local cultural
emphasized femininity. These social signals are useful in
"charting the coproduction of global and local culture"
(Bray, 2007, p. 53) in the perpetual movements toward glo-
balization. Masculinity and femininity expressions are tenu-
ous within gender relations. They are confronted by or
intersect with other social attributes such as class, kinship,
cultural norms, age to name a few, which create a situated
expression of the same, and beeping as a practice is particu-
larly indicative of this. The socioeconomic aspect of beeping
when shown to interact with the gender reveals a practice
that extends beyond the economics of beeping. In principle,
the social relationship to the beep recipient negotiates this
practice to a greater extent than the economic resources.
Africa's 130 million daily beeps are thus doing much more
than merely informing recipients of a missed call. They are
reinforcing and sometimes negotiating relationships and
hierarchies across the continent.

2. Users as active agents in thwarting what producers initially
have in mind for a technology is an interesting thought worth
pursuing, but it is beyond the scope of the current article. For
other similar studies that denote similar arguments (cf. Cock-
burn & Ormrod, 1993; Oudshoorn & Pinch, 2005).

5. I realize the debate surrounding the concept of hegemonic
masculinity, where a number of arguments disagree with the
10 SAGE Open
notion of hegemonic masculinity (cf. Donaldson, 1993) as first
introduced by Connell (1987). Connell and Messerschmidt
(2005) rethink the concept by advising that hegemonic mascu-
linity as a concept be situated when utilized to avoid, homog-
enizing the notion.
6. For example, the Nokia 3310 manual mentions "beep" as the
noise made by the phone when an incoming call interrupts an
ongoing one. A "beep" sound can also be the signal selected
for incoming calls. Another example in the Nokia 6300 man-
ual indicates beeping as the sound made when an ongoing call
is recorded by the recipient of a call. With the 6210, a beep is
described as the noise made by the phone when a voice tag to
a phone number is added. Even though beeping as a phrase
appears in the Nokia manuals, it is not listed as a communica-
tion feature in the same sense that the informants of this study
relate to the practice. None of the manuals studied supplied
instructions on how to perform beeping as a communication
process.
