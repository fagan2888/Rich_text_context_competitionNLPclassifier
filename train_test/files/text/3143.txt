The conundrum of police
officer-involved homicides:
Counter-data in Los Angeles County

Abstract
This paper draws from critical data studies and related fields to investigate police officer-involved homicide data for Los
Angeles County. We frame police officer-involved homicide data as a rhetorical tool that can reify certain assumptions
about the world and extend regimes of power. We highlight the possibility that this type of sensitive civic data can be
investigated and employed within local communities through creative practice. Community involvement with data can
create a countervailing force to powerful dominant narratives and supplement activist projects that hold local officials
accountable for their actions. Our analysis examines four Los Angeles County police officer-involved homicide data sets.
First, we provide accounts of the semantics, granularity, scale and transparency of this local data. Then, we describe a
``counter data action,'' an event that invited members of the community to identify the limits and challenges present in
police officer-involved homicide data and to propose new methods for deriving meaning from these indicators and
statistics.

Introduction
Now data seems like a dry and boring word, but with-
out it, we cannot understand our world and make it
better. How can we address concerns about use of
force, how can we address concerns about officer
involved shootings, if we do not have a reliable grasp
of the demographics and the circumstances of those
incidents? [. . .] Without complete and accurate data,
we are left with ideological thunderbolts, and that
helps spark unrest and distrust and does not help us
get better. --FBI Director James Coney, February 12,
2015. (Comey, 2015)
Newspaper headlines throughout 2014­2015 reported a
spate of killings of unarmed African Americans by
police officers around the United States. Incidents
that took place in Ferguson, Missouri; Baltimore;
New York; and Los Angeles, among others, ignited a
frustrated public who took to the streets and launched
social media campaigns to challenge the violence and
racial profiling by police officials. Local and national
administrations responded by implementing task forces
and new policies around officer conduct. Yet even with
new corrective measures in place, the disturbing trend
of racially targeted violence exposed the difficulty of
tallying the extent of these killings, thanks to a signifi-
cant gap of data on the number of police officer-
involved homicides (POIHs) across the US. Scholars
of Criminal Justice, Public Health, and Public Policy
have all documented these failings since the 1970s,
(Loftin et al., 2003; Sherman and Langworthy, 1979)
but the public outcry throughout 2014­2015 has
exposed the data's alarming incompleteness to a wider

public (Loftin et al., 2003).1­3 As FiveThirtyEight
reporter Reuben Fischer-Baum notes, the FBI's
Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR)--the fed-
eral database of police shootings generally referenced
by news reports--is an inadequate accounting of
such statistics because it only publishes police
homicides declared `justified' (Fischer-Baum, 2014).
Furthermore, law enforcement agencies are not man-
dated to report these deaths, leading to a reporting rate
of less than a third. When states do report, the data
could be differently collected across states and local
jurisdictions (Barry and Jones, 2014; Bump, 2014).
Such elisions in official data come at a time of so-
called data deluge as we increasingly turn to data as a
mechanism for solving societal problems. This impulse
was on display in one of President Barack Obama's first
Memorandums in office. The Transparency and Open
Government initiative in 2009 committed to ``unprece-
dented levels of openness,'' most visibly through a web-
site of federal databases, data.gov (Obama, 2009). The
website's thousands of executive agency datasets are
available without fees and with minimal licensing
restrictions; they provide a window into government
processes such as budgeting, environmental oversight,
and scientific research. Providing a rich set of resources
for research and technological innovation, the website
also promises greater insight into government
procedures.
The lack of data on POIHs, however, reveals that
there are ongoing gaps in the government's transpar-
ency efforts. Despite the enormous apparati our gov-
ernment invests in other types of data collection,
data.gov currently contains no downloadable national
database of POIH data and only links to a website
maintained by the Department of Justice, where the
data is not easily accessible or downloadable.4 While
Obama's Police Data Initiative is a recent step towards
remedying this situation, official information on such
killings remains fragmentary and difficult to find (Smith
and Austin, 2015). National-level data are overall inter-
ested in measures of accountability, yet the ellipses in
these datasets seem primarily to result from the lack of
a data assemblage that would support the consistent
collection and recording of data, as well as the dissem-
ination of the data that is collected, even though these
large organizations would ostensibly have the resources
and labor power to oversee efficient data production.
Some of the best-kept statistics on national POIH
are not government-based but collected by activist
groups and newspapers. Two of the largest,
KilledByPolice.net and Fatal Encounters, are civilian
efforts. Operation Ghetto Storm, published by the
Malcolm X grassroots committee, released a 2012
report using statistical information from local police
departments on police killings of African Americans
in the U.S. The Center for Policing Equity at UCLA
similarly collects and analyzes information on police-
civilian encounters, studying racial profiling as one of
four primary areas of concern. Recently, both The
Guardian and The Washington Post have also estab-
lished their own national counts on POIH in the U.S.5
The data on homicides collected by law enforcement
and civic groups provides a case to examine the cultural
and political dimensions of such statistics and to pos-
ition this data within power struggles to own, manage,
and share it among different groups. This approach is
in line with the growing area of research called critical
data studies, a body of scholarship that shares concerns
with critical informatics, statactivism, critical making,
and critical information studies. Critical data studies
seeks to explore data as situated in complex assem-
blages of action, from data collection and categoriza-
tion to its subsequent cleaning, storing, and
dissemination. This framework also considers how
this data is then granted meaning and value as it
becomes operable in different situations. Using this the-
oretical understanding of data, this research then asks
how we can move beyond dissecting and analyzing
POIH data towards understanding it as a lever of pol-
itical action. We have found through our research that
community groups are concerned with augmenting the
current gaps in local and national data collecting and
publishing this data themselves. Through mixed-meth-
ods data collection, analysis, and visualization, activists
can provide an alternative to the official statistical
ellipses and foster a call to political action.
In what follows, we lay out existing research con-
ducted within critical data studies and related fields
and situate our research on POIH data within this lit-
erature. We present a critical analysis of existing Los
Angeles County POIH data to understand how the
events and evidence surrounding a life taken become
represented as a metric imbued with rhetorical power.
Finally, we describe what we term, after Dalton and
Thatcher, a counter-data action, a hackathon that
invited community groups to examine and re-interpret
POIH data. The event outcomes challenge the existing
``official'' data by examining it and remixing it with
POIH data collected by local media and community
groups in Los Angeles in an effort to build counter-
narratives to the federal accounts.
Situating data in assemblages
A major goal of critical data studies is to understand
data as situated in socio-technical systems that sur-
round its production, processing, storing, sharing, ana-
lysis, and reuse. Data assemblages, as Kitchin terms
these vast systems, are comprised not just of database
infrastructures, but also the ``technological, political,
2 Big Data & Society
social and economic apparatuses that frames their
nature, operation and work'' (Kitchin et al., 2015).
Data assemblages are maintained by the practices that
emerge around them, including their production and
collation with other data systems, their subsequent dis-
tribution by scientific literature or financial markets,
and citizen efforts to work with data. A growing body
of research examines the labor and political economies
entailed in the reproduction of these assemblages,
focusing on practices as diverse as meteorological
data (Bates, 2015); data produced by for-profit educa-
tion companies (Williamson, 2016), and order security
data (Ajana, 2015). In this literature, the production of
data assemblages is not a neutral, technical process, but
a normative, political, and ethical one that is contingent
and often contested, with consequences for subsequent
analysis, interpretation, and action (Kitchin, 2014).
Data assemblages also function as a representation
of knowledge, with the ability to shape what we know
and what we do based on that knowledge. These sys-
tems carry complex epistemological implications that
encourage careful consideration of what sorts of know-
ledge we can derive from data, as well as practical
implications--what types of action should be taken
based on the knowledge resulting from data. As such,
we are encouraged to question how decisions made in
the design and use of these tools shape our understand-
ing of the world in which we live.
Literature from critical data studies implicates the
following three considerations of data assemblages: an
epistemological stance that views data as consisting of
material and discursive systems that reify certain
assumptions about the world, as well as involve and
extend regimes of power; the need to investigate meth-
ods and designs of data construction, including choices
made about definitions of phenomena, granularity, and
scope of the dataset, and a dataset's position within
wider assemblages of support; and finally, the import-
ance of counter-data action, or engagement with a crit-
ical framework through practical applications in which
individuals actively interrogate data and their relation
to it, as well as improve data literacy in communities
that have particular stakes in certain data sets.
Data as a rhetorical tool
Critical data studies generally critiques the widely held
understanding of data as an objective set of facts that
exist prior to ideology, politics, or interpretation
(Kitchin, 2014). The common adage ``the data speaks
for itself'' assumes that this data can be used to deter-
mine direct meaning that transcends context or
domain-specific knowledge.6 In contrast, data is here
understood as a contingent set of processes that shape
the objects represented. Observations are therefore not
simply supported by data, but are generated by them,
giving data rhetorical power (Rosenberg, 2013).
The position that data is not a transparent and
objective phenomenon but can function as a rhetorical
tool, inherently tied to the technological, political,
social, and economic infrastructures that sustain it,
allows it to be investigated as a real force in the
world. Data can, as Ian Hacking puts it, ``make
people up'' once people define themselves and build
institutions based on the categories of a data ontology,
whether mental health schemas or the census (Hacking,
1986). There is accordingly a double-sidedness to data,
as Alain Desrosieres asserts, since it functions both as a
description for what we know as well as a basis for
action, particularly when the data is inscribed in
stable systems and institutions. The more opaque,
powerful, and efficient the systems, the more capably
the data can resist critique and operate as something
real in a reinforcing loop (Rosenberg, 2013). Statistical
techniques, scientific proofs, and government records
all lend themselves to this type of reality, as the material
recordings become a basis for wide agreement and
hence objectivity.
Crime statistics in this way have long been a con-
tested source of discursive power. Writing in 1965
Savitz and Johnston called attention to the dangers of
rhetoric promoting an ``aura of infallibility'' that often
surrounds crime statistics (1049). The authors discuss
the media's role in not properly conveying the limited
nature of crime reporting statistics adequately enough
to the public. As this data shapes our understanding of
phenomena, we then must ask what it is evidence of and
how its rhetorical strength or weakness is constituted
by the assemblages in which it is situated.
Methods of infrastructural inversion
Infrastructure studies works in tandem with critical
data studies to offer a method for analyzing the deci-
sions made at various steps of data gathering, manage-
ment, design, and display (Bowker, 2007; Bowker et al.,
2010). This literature argues that at any given moment,
data are only snapshots that have been composed
through the modeling and ``cooking'' that happens in
the algorithmic process of data capture (Bowker, 2007).
The production of data is not inevitable; protocols,
organizational processes, measurement scales, cate-
gories, and standards are designed, negotiated, and
debated in the process of data generation. As such,
the method of infrastructural inversion proposed by
Star and Bowker lays bare the historical development
of certain statistical and classificatory tools that then
are co-constitutive of how users, and the society in
which they are situated, see the world (Star and
Bowker, 1999). Infrastructural inversion seeks to
Currie et al. 3
uncover those infrastructures--technical, social, polit-
ical, and economic systems that facilitate certain types
of knowledge--that have become invisible as a result of
their efficiency or ubiquity. The relationship of infra-
structure and the symbolic realms of power is, for
example, seen in Bowker and Star's 1999 examination
of the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) for clas-
sifying death (Star and Bowker, 1999). This classifica-
tion situates disease in the system so that the political,
ethical, and social contingencies appear naturalized.
Phil Agre's potent and portentous 1994 work in
Wired declared that with the massive increase in data
being generated over 20 years ago, methods of data
production must become more transparent. However,
one will note that this prescription for data transpar-
ency has hardly been heeded. Infrastructural inversion
must often excavate how the ownership and manage-
ment of data systems impact the types of treatment or
statistical application applied to data sets. Additionally,
an analysis must be sensitive to how semantics, or the
way that the data is related to definitions, is of utmost
importance to the meaning derived from a particular
dataset. The ways data are described or labeled, for
instance, may invite comparisons between datasets
that are not warranted, while more explicit labeling
encourages clear and necessary comparisons (Agre,
1996). Transparency of data production, semantics,
and the level of information that is captured--its
granularity--are all facets that serve as clues about
the data's production. Consequently, an investigation
of how data on POIH is generated must examine the
assemblages of which it is part, and its relation to tech-
nical, economic, and ideological assumptions. These
attributes exist in combination with the work that
data does in the world and how these can influence
different ways of communicating, expressing, and
taking action.
The case for counter-data action
History tells us that statistical data can serve as the
basis for political activism. In 19th century France
and Prussia, social reformers and labor activists
worked with civil servants to gather statistics on the
conditions of labor to improve workers' living condi-
tions, unemployment, and hygiene, while in Germany
reformers used population statistics to introduce social
protections such as disability insurance (Desrosie
` res
and Naish, 2002; Hacking, 1987). Yet critical data stu-
dies depart from 19th century conceptions of statistics
that parsed social and economic issues such as poverty
and health as objective, distinct from passion, and
polemics. Scholars of critical data scholars, rather, set
out to expose ``the double role of statistics in
representing as well as criticizing reality'' (Desrosie
` res
and Naish, 2002). They understand data, per
Desrosieres, as both a kind of description and basis
for action. It is through this lens that data practices
can ignite new forms of activism and resistance.
Critical geographers Dalton and Thatcher call acts
of resistance to politically dominant datasets counter-
data action (Dalton and Thatcher, 2014). This notion
draws from their work in critical geographic informa-
tion systems (GIS), an approach that diverges from the
conventional view of geographic maps as a model of the
world, to an understanding of maps as political and
legal claims on reality. Based on this framework, pur-
veyors of Public Participatory GIS engage ``counter
mapping'' as a method of emancipatory action--gener-
ally by a community looking to reclaim or denounce
external dominance of resources. In a similar vein, pur-
veyors of ``statactivism'' use this term to describe
``emerging forms of collective actions that use numbers,
measurements, and indicators as a means of denunci-
ation and criticism'' (Bruno et al., 2014). Statactivists
might collect and deploy data that does not exist to
make a cause more visible--an historic example of
this is the case of AIDS activists in the 1980s--or
resist or reject official state indicators and benchmarks
through original data collection. These practices might
analyze different types of data of varying levels of
granularity, collected from different organizations
which all presume to shed light on the same phenom-
ena, so that the contingent and negotiated aspects of
data might come to the fore. These examples are all acts
of appropriation and intervention, a means of wresting
control of the power of statistics by either decrying cer-
tain authoritative metrics or devising new ones.
An example of this type of counter-data action
related to crime reporting can be found in Conroy
and Scassa's discussion of a data collection model for
sexual assault reporting developed in Philadelphia
(Conroy and Scassa, 2015). The authors reflect on the
unreliability of sexual assault data and reveal that the
data generally only address the issue of bringing about
an awareness of the gaps in reporting. The scholars
propose a model that involves extensive collaboration
between the Philadelphia Police Department and local
women's advocacy groups to attempt a more proper
handling of sexual assault reporting. As part of this
model, the authors suggested the women's groups con-
duct annual reviews of sexual assault reports that were
deemed unfounded in order to aid in assessing incidents
of mishandling. This model directly addresses the nebu-
lous nature and tenuous understanding of government
transparency, especially considering its significant ties
to accountability and subsequent abilities to address
institutional deficiencies through the promotion
of community values (Conroy and Scassa, 2015).
4 Big Data & Society
These overarching concepts set an important basis
for the community-centered framework we set for our
counter-data action.
We draw from this work, along with critical data
studies and related literature, the need to engage in
counter-data action in which researchers address their
own positionality, carefully consider the implications of
the data they use, and work to find ways to resist uneth-
ical uses of data (Dalton and Thatcher, 2014). We sug-
gest that there are certain affordances in investigating
sensitive civic data in relation to the assemblages that
sustain and support the data sets, how data is con-
structed, as well as the effects of the data in society at
large as a result of their use or rhetoric surrounding the
data. It is also important to ask what questions can and
cannot be answered by the data.
As we will discuss in the following sections, we begin
by analyzing four POIH data assemblages, then
describe an event in which members of the community
engaged with these POIH datasets in a unique counter-
data action. Our goals at this event were first, to iden-
tify the limits and challenges present in the local and
federal metrics that are already publicly available on
POIH, then to propose new methods for deriving
meaning from indicators and statistics. In this way,
we seek to lay bare the various apparatuses that nego-
tiate process and deploy POIH.
Setting the stage for our counter-data action are four
datasets of POIH data for Los Angeles County. During
the hackathon, we explored, remixed, and reinterpreted
these four databases. Two are managed at the federal
level, the FBI's SHR, the National Center for Health
Statistics' (NCHS), National Vital Statistics System
(NVSS), and two by local organizations, the Los
Angeles Times Homicide Report, and the Youth Justice
Coalition (YJC). In the following section, we describe
these four datasets and introduce each as a data assem-
blage with unique elements of institutional, legal, finan-
cial, and material support (Kitchin et al., 2015).
POIH databases of Los Angeles County
The first of our datasets is the FBI's Supplementary
Homicide Report (SHR). The SHR, the most fre-
quently cited among the federal datasets, was begun
in 1962 as part of the more extensive Uniform Crime
Reporting (UCR) database that the FBI has main-
tained for 85 years.7 While the older UCR provides
annual counts of all recorded homicides in aggregate
numbers, the SHR supplements the UCR with granular
details that provide some context of the event, particu-
larly the victims' relation to offenders (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 2015; Sherman and Langworthy, 1979).
These details are manually recorded by local law
enforcement agencies on a voluntary form; how the
form is filled out might vary, and data fields are treated
as optional (see Figure 1 for the form.). Once completed,
the form is then compiled and coded either by the FBI or
by state-reporting agencies to produce the statistical data
for all counties in the U.S. that report it. By recording
information into the form's column labeled ``circum-
stances,'' the SHR allows agencies to report data on
justifiable homicides by law enforcement--coded as
``Felon Killed by Police Officer'' (code 81). The FBI
offers no evidence as to whether it provides additional
oversight over the accuracy of the forms.
As is clear from ongoing criticisms, the SHR has
very weak institutional, legal, and financial ensembles
of support. Because the report is not legally mandated,
many states decline to participate. In data released on
the SHR in 2003, 18 states have opted out from report-
ing on this classification during certain years, with
Washington D.C., Montana, and Nebraska opting
out of reporting at least 12 years and Florida opting
out entirely (``Bureau of Justice Statistics UCR and
NIBRS Participation,'' n.d.). Even if a form is sub-
mitted, data entry is often incomplete--law enforcement
reporting a homicide will not always include demo-
graphic data, for instance. According to the Guardian,
``In 2011, 31% of SHRs omitted the offender's sex, age
and race. When the victim was a black male, basic iden-
tifying data on the offender was omitted more often,
39.9% of the time'' (McCarthy, 2015b).
SHR's decentralized, bottom-up approach also cre-
ates problems with consistency: data gathered from
local sources confront variable software and media to
make the recordings, differences that are hidden in the
aggregate. As a White House press release reported,
Camden PD ``cobbles together 41 systems that have
individual value, but are not designed to work together,
requiring their beat officers to enter the same data mul-
tiple times'' (Smith and Austin, 2015). Without stand-
ardization, the report cautioned, analysis of these
sources may not be meaningful. Additionally, the
SHR provides only information based on the initial
police investigation, not on subsequent decisions
made by prosecutors or courts.
Our second dataset, the NVSS, gathers reports that
originate from death certificates by a coroner or med-
ical examiner, as required by law in 36 states (``Easy
Access to the FBI's Supplementary Homicide
Reports,'' n.d:; Enten, 2012; Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 2015). In contrast to the voluntary
SHR, the NVSS is mandatory. To be classified as a
POIH, this form must certify manner-of-death as a
homicide, then provide additional detail in an open
text field that asks the coroner to ``describe how the
injury occurred''. Only if an officer is listed as a perpet-
rator in this description is the death coded, through the
International Classification of Disease-10 codes, as
Currie et al. 5
``Death by legal intervention.'' Problems of reliability
crop up, however, because the instructions for complet-
ing the form do not explicitly indicate that police
involvement be mentioned at all, while coroners may
not even know if the deceased was involved in an
attempted arrest at the time of death. (Loftin et al.,
2003) Studies have shown the inadequacy of this data,
with underreporting as high as 51% in some cases
(Sherman and Langworthy, 1979). The NVSS lack of
guidelines for the death certification makes underre-
porting inevitable. Furthermore, unlike the SHR, the
NVSS only provides aggregate data at the county level,
obscuring demographic data at the level of each inci-
dent. So while NVSS captures the most detail, counting
many aspects that the other datasets do not such as
measures of victim marital status and educational
attainment, it does not make this data public except
in aggregate (Quinn, 2014).
The third data set, the LA Times' (LAT) comprehen-
sive Homicide Report, gathers statistics and analysis on
all deaths within Los Angeles County. The Report is a
part of the LAT Data Desk; it uses, at a very minimum,
police reports corroborated with the coroner's reports,
and it sometimes supplements these with investigative
reporting on cases when money and time allow. The
data for each homicide is displayed publicly online on
a dynamic map, as well as in individual posts with
description about each death. Each post is organized
through statistical data capturing neighborhood in
which the death occurred, gender, age, race and ethni-
city, cause of death, and whether an officer was involved.
The LAT is very interested in questions of access and, as
such, their website makes information on these homi-
cides easily accessible (Burghardt, 2014). Their interface
combines quantitative numbers on police homicides with
accompanying qualitative information found through
their investigations. LAT has an FAQ on its website
with information about how the Homicide Report
data is collected and processed, and each individual
post includes the contact information of the author for
questions or concern from the public. The LAT's data is
browsable but not downloadable on its website; individ-
uals can request the statistical data, which the LAT pro-
vides in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.
SHR, NVSS, and LAT have concerns of much wider
scope than the specifics of POIH;8 they are exhaustive
statistical classification systems that attempt to capture
an entire range of phenomena--all homicides or all
deaths. Our fourth dataset, a report of the deceased
collected by the YJC, in contrast, devotes personnel
to explicitly capture POIH data. The YJC is a commu-
nity organization devoted to issues around incarcer-
ation, youth, and race. The organization's report is a
database that uses coroner's reports corroborated with
police reports, and in some cases makes it report based
on interviews with the family of the deceased, as well as
eye witnesses and community members in the area
where the victim was killed. Accompanying demo-
graphic data (age, gender, race), data on the neighbor-
hood and address where the homicide occurred, and
date of death, the YJC in some cases also provides a
photograph of the deceased and a short description for
each incident of police homicide (for example, ``Called
to mental health facility; officers claimed they shot
because Saucedo approached with `sharp object.'')
Their website is not as widely known as the LAT
Homicide Report, nor do they incorporate any sort of
interactive elements to the display of their information,
but they do make available for download the PDF that
documents this information.
The two county-only datasets by LAT and YJC
diverge from the federal datasets in at least four impor-
tant ways. First, the county data offers more granularity
than the federal accounts, with data points capturing the
place where the individual was killed and the victim's
name. Second, in contrast to the federal datasets, the
local data often uses more than one source to verify
and detail the incidents. The local datasets also introduce
qualitative information at the level of each death, some-
times as a result of investigatory effort. Finally, the local
statistics are dynamic. In controversial cases, both orga-
nizations follow and document legal proceedings that
take place following the homicide and adjust accounts
as new information comes to light, capturing contesta-
tions that can occur as a homicide are deemed justified or
unjustified. The federal SHR, in contrast, maintains local
police agencies as the arbiters of a death's justifiability.
The numbers do not capture any subsequent legal proce-
dures that might prove the contrary (Loftin et al., 2003).
The local data, it should be acknowledged, is limited
for research in that it does not scale up: the methods
used by these sources are specific to local phenomenon
and cannot be analyzed alongside local data from other
counties that do not use the same collection methodol-
ogies. Yet we found that the local data provide a coun-
ter-narrative to the strictly quantitative data found in
the federal accounts that naturalizes these recordings as
official facts. Local data is a rhetorical tool that shapes
how we understand police homicides. As we describe
below, the counter-data action entailed considering this
smaller-scale local data with the larger federal data
troves to find cases in which the data did not match,
as well as to bring qualitative, interpretive analysis to
bear on our understanding of POIH.
A counter-data action:
The POIH hackathon
Our approach lies in pushing the critical understanding
of sensitive civic data toward the exploration of new
6 Big Data & Society
community-based mixed-method approaches to data
analysis. In order to do so, we hosted a civic hackathon
during which we engaged with local Los Angeles com-
munity groups to re-interpret the data sets and develop
meaningful practices around POIH data in accordance
with diverse sensibilities, experiences, and needs. We
take seriously the claim that ``we are our tools,'' as
the quantification of human features and actions can
both enable and place limits on knowledge and action
(boyd & Crawford, 2012; Thatcher, 2015). The hacka-
thon, as an example of counter-data action, aimed to
allow researchers and citizens to reclaim such tools,
participate in their development, and employ them to
build alternative discourses and meanings.
We conceptualized the hackathon as a hacker-maker
space (HMS), a context that generally focuses on open-
access workshops devoted to teaching and learning
through creative and technical work (DiSalvo et al.,
2012). What distinguishes HMS events from the trad-
itional hackathon is a focus on the material dimensions
of the objects of investigation (DiSalvo et al., 2012).
During these events, the traditional ``creative mis-use''
of a piece of technology is realized along with its ``hands-
on re-construction'' (Schrock, 2014). Participants re-
construct objects produced from one particular design
tradition, but deploy different assumptions and
new design and collection methods. Such strategies are
proposed, tested, and processed, and, in doing so, sim-
ultaneously ``learned,'' in an act similar to Matt Ratto's
critical making. Critical making focuses on interroga-
tions of the socio-technical through tracing back the
ways ``things are made'' in order to produce, re-produce,
or imagine various objects (Ratto, 2011).
Among the primary goals of the hackathon was to
collectively investigate how the POIH data sets were
constructed. During the hackathon, we worked side-
by-side with the participants with the goal of under-
standing the ways different actors collect and organize
POIH data--in tabular and visual formats, in coding
practices and on social media--in order to imagine
how these processes might proceed otherwise. The
awareness that we gained through this process of critical
making provided us with new ways to independently re-
interpret and make sense of the local and federal data on
POIH. The rest of this section discusses the different
interpretations or sense-making projects developed at
the hackathon. We categorize these projects into three
main types: data as creative practice; triangulation with
different types of qualitative content, primarily social
media; and alternate metrics. Our goal was neither to
improve the validity and reliability of POIH data, nor
to come up with policy recommendations, but to explore
the ways in which dissident and creative approaches to
data analysis can reveal something new and unexpected
about their contingent nature.
Overview of the POIH hackathon
We invited the public to investigate POIH data at the
Hackathon on Police Brutality held in February, 2015
at UCLA (see Figure 2). In preparation for the hacka-
thon, we gathered and organized the four data sets on
Los Angeles County POIH and made these available in
a public Google spreadsheet. We advertised the event
widely, attracting nearly 50 individuals, who ranged
from students and professors to members of police
watchdog groups, for the four-hour event. The event
opened with a panel comprising speakers to talk
about their experiences in investigating police abuses
and brutality. Speakers included lead reporters from
the LAT Homicide Report, representatives from the
Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, and Andrew Schrock
from the University of Southern California's
Innovation Lab. The LAT reporters described in
detail how they collect, analyze, and visualize data
related to POI homicides in Los Angeles County.
Stop LAPD Spying representatives discussed the
social and technical challenges that occur when com-
munity groups try to make sense of the POIH phenom-
enon, while Schrock provided some background
knowledge about the use of a hackathon event as a
form of social action.
After the panel, participants organized themselves
into four teams. The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition
led a discussion on police officer POIHs in LA
County. A second group began analyzing inconsisten-
cies between the federal databases and local databases,
while a third group scanned social media networks in
order to gain insights about specific discovered unre-
ported cases. The last group worked to visualize the
extant POIH data to disseminate to the public.9
POIH data as a creative practice
Members of the visualization team devised a multi-
media project that combined the addresses of all
POIH sites contained in YJC's data set with Google
Street View images of the locations where the events
took place. The goal was to display the site-specific
images side-by-side in columns and rows (see Figure
3). Before being able to merge the two datasets, we
worked closely with YJC members and other hacka-
thons' participants to create an Excel file with all the
locations of the homicides. Indeed, because the YJC
dataset originated as a word document manually com-
piled entry by entry, the counter-data action provided
computer science students who helped YJC convert
their datasets into a spreadsheet for easier processing.
Once displayed, the POIH spreadsheet gained strik-
ing spatial and visual dimensions of locales that are, if
not specifically and singularly identifiable, then
Currie et al. 7
sufficiently reminiscent of an everyday milieu. If viewers
can identify with these images at all, then it renders
more palpable the realities of incidents of POIH occur-
ring at these sites. Furthermore, these images can be
analyzed in order to identify common environmental
features of POIH sites--whether POIH occur more
often in streets with particular architectural features
or surrounded by other physical features, in parks, or
near certain types of buildings or institutions. The work
produced by the visualization team in this way encour-
aged those at the hackathon to think critically about
the spatial dimension of incidents of POIH.
POIH social media data and qualitative content
Some of those in attendance at the hackathon were
drawn to the challenge of supplementing the available
POIH data with qualitative narratives surrounding the
POIH incidents. This group mined social media for any
indications of online presence for victims, drawing from
the individual names in the YJC dataset. Narrowing the
search to 2012, the most recent year of available SHR
information, the group searched through social media
sites--Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, and per-
sonal blogs--to identify online presence and lingering
traces of POIH victims.
Three main types of online presence emerged: per-
sistence of the deceased's activity online, in the form of
blog posts or Facebook comments they wrote while still
alive; sensationalized commentary surrounding the
victim, particularly in the form of YouTube comments
on videos capturing the incident; and social media
memorials dedicated to the deceased, with comments
from family members, friends, and others.10 Though
we found at least one of the three types of online
social media presence for the majority of the victims
searched, there remained a portion with no online
trace at all, a phenomenon that cannot be properly
explained without further research. This sort of work
directly acknowledges and memorializes the deceased,
as searching for and curating these details aid in pro-
viding a narrative of each victim beyond that of a single
numerical entry in a collected database.
POIH data as alternate metrics
As a third outcome, the hackathon focused on under-
standing the shortcomings of the federal POIH data by
comparing various datasets. Accordingly, the data
mining team performed an in-depth analysis of the mul-
tiple inconsistencies between the LA Times data and
SHR data set. For example, the LAT Homicide
Report data indicated 38 POIHs in contrast with the
33 reported in SHR for the same year (2012) and in the
same geographical area. Initially, the hackathon
participants established the goal of identifying the five
unreported cases of 2012 in the SHR. However, the
situation revealed a much more complicated nature
than first expected. In the SHR, the group found that
there were 11 reported homicides that did not match
the LAT Homicide Report based on age, gender, and
date. In the LAT Homicide Report, there were 18 that
could not be accounted for in the SHR based on age,
date, and location. Of the documented instances of
POIH in both datasets, just 23 POIHs were consistent
between the two datasets. The group found that five
were very close to matching both databases, but were
a year off in age, or reported the death in an adjoining
neighborhood. Overall, the information contained in
the two datasets was largely inconsistent. Thus, it was
observed that discrepancies exist not only in the count
of the deceased itself, but also in the details of each
account.
Discussion: The social values of data
The focus on engendering critical dialogue and creative
reinterpretation of POIH data at the local level is abso-
lutely fundamental to the work we present in this paper.
One of the more important outcomes of our exercise in
counter-data activism was collectively uncovering some
of the ``values'' leading to the production of the local
and federal POIH data sets and how these choices
inform any knowledge production based on the data.
In this case, the hackathon found that POIH data at the
local level produced contrasting indicators of lived real-
ity and then used this finding to help participants
understand the choices that shaped the data. The
hackathon in this way demonstrated the existence of
large incongruities between the datasets and spoke to
the contingent choices made by the different organiza-
tions that collect, store, and report this data. In this
discussion section, we present three examples of differ-
ences that came to light over the course of the
hackathon--distinctions that affect how knowledge of
POIH is produced and ultimately normalized.
First, participants of the alternate metrics group dis-
cussed how each dataset reveals the decisions made
about what details to collect on each homicide, a
choice that involves biases of what should be visible
and invisible within a schema. These variances in
granularity bounded the analysis at the hackathon by
the level of detail and comparability possible across
datasets. This constraint, which hindered analysis,
became a source of discussion. All schemas capture
race, gender, and age, but otherwise categories varied.
Only the local data included the incident address and
names of deceased. LAT and YJC incident accounts
had information on whether victims were intoxicated,
whether domestic abuse was involved, and whether
8 Big Data & Society
witnesses dispute the account, but such information is
not categorized in a schema. The federal datasets have
no categories for purportedly non-lethal actions, such
as tasing, that may lead to death. Furthermore, all
datasets failed to capture certain information, such as
statistics about the number of officers who fired,
number of bullets fired, or number of bullets hit--all
details that could shed light on ``on differential `kill
ratios''' of certain police agencies compared to others
(Klinger, 2012).
Second, the social media group found that qualita-
tive details at the incident level of the local data reveal
community concerns around particular deaths--con-
cerns that are smoothed over and rendered anodyne
when represented solely in statistical form. For exam-
ple, a Facebook memorial for a young woman includes
posts by family and friends dedicated to issues around
police violence and advocacy for the mentally ill. One
comment describes that the young woman died after
``cradling a small ball peen hammer in the lobby of
the Asian Pacific Family Center where she was receiv-
ing mental health services.'' The post goes on,
``Witnesses at the scene reported that the young
woman was sitting calmly with the hammer in her lap
before the police arrived.'' The comment then ends with
a general call for more awareness during police
responses to the mentally ill: ``It is also a place for us
to advocate on behalf of other people like the young
woman so that the ignorance of mental health by law
enforcement does not lead to another precious life
cut short.'' Qualitative details such as this at the inci-
dent level can restore the narratives of witnesses
and loved ones, making concrete what otherwise
becomes a formal abstraction. Highlighting and parsing
these details contribute to a continued awareness of the
contested nature of the data used to represent these
incidents.
Finally, during the general discussion with the pan-
elists at the hackathon, the question arose of whether
the datasets were counting the same phenomena. What
constitutes a POIH is not simple or clear-cut, and
enforcement agencies cannot turn to law to determine
what constitutes a POIH. The datasets subtly differ in
how they define and circumscribe a complex and often
politically fraught phenomenon. The FBI's SHR, for
instance, does not specify the definition of a justified
homicide beyond ``the killing of a felon by a peace offi-
cer in the line of duty'' (``Uniform Crime Reporting
Handbook,'' 2004). Falling out of SHR's Code 81 clas-
sification are ``unjustified'' homicides, a designation
that by definition criminalizes victims of homicides,
nor does the definition count deaths that are not dir-
ectly traceable to homicide by an officer, such as suicide
or intoxication, even if these are effects related to the
officers' presence. Nor does Code 81 count deaths on
federal property or by federal agents.11 The NVSS simi-
larly only counts deaths in which the underlying cause
was directly attributed to ``legal interventions'' by an
officer.12 Both the NVSS and SHR assume the victim is
a ``felon'' or ``lawbreaker''; such semantics a priori
criminalize the deceased, endowing the schema the
power to define the dead prior to investigation or trial.
The symbolic power of semantics is also found in the
classification of POIH in the ICD, the schema used by
the NVSS. The CDC's ICD-10 uses the same code for
homicides by law enforcement as it does acts of war and
law enforcement. When there is little distinction
between homicides by act of war, a designation
widely held to be noble, and those caused by law
enforcement, it is possible to assume that the classifica-
tion is based on a legal, moral, and ethical character of
homicides of this nature, showing the contamination of
these factors on ICD's narrative of classification.
Policy makers are looking to correct the failings of
POIH data. An executive task force that formed after
the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO, for
instance, recommended that local law enforcement
agencies require federal agencies to report when their
officers kill someone (McCarthy, 2015a; Obama, 2015).
Obama's Police Data Initiative seeks to remedy the
situation with open data standards that clarify and
streamline reporting procedures for law enforcement
agencies. Through better data and data-driven solu-
tions, FBI Director Comey insists, we can avoid emo-
tionally driven claims and instead deploy ``ideological
agnostics that look to information to try to solve prob-
lems'' (Comey, 2015). Yet, our work at the hackathon
revealed that any national account of killings by police
officers, even one that redresses current failings, makes
choices about how to define a POIH, how to capture
conflicting accounts, and the granularity of data about
the death to include. These remain interpretive matters
constituting the socio-technical dimensions of the data
in any case.
In sum, data can be employed to encourage a critical
conception of events, revealing patterns that suggest
alternate paths for accounting for phenomena, particu-
larly to augment governance systems widely character-
ized as broken, or in serious need of repair. Rather than
acting as conclusive evidence, data can be the starting
point to ask new questions that come to light, both
through reinterpretations and creative practice.
Reflections on the particular outcomes of our coun-
ter-data action and the overarching themes they relay
about the nature of the data in many ways circle back
to the major themes of critical data studies discussed
throughout the literature review: that data assemblages
are fraught with semantic import, that they operate as a
set of relations reproduced by interest groups and
material infrastructures, and that POIH data can lead
Currie et al. 9
to a creative array of outcomes in the areas of analyt-
ical, qualitative, and visualization work.
That said, we also realize that this event only
scratched the surface. As a data assemblage itself, the
hackathon had clear limitations bounded by the short
time frame of four hours, by the academic institution
that hosted it, by the potential inaccessibility of the
event to potential participants geographically and
otherwise, and by the data literacies of the participants,
many of whom were students, professors, or already
embedded in activist networks. Overall, we present
the hackathon as a preliminary template for more sus-
tained engagement between the datasets analyzed and
communities they have meaning to. The event lasted
only one afternoon, and we cannot yet point to indica-
tors of substantial social change that arose from it.
Certainly, there were tangible outcomes, such as the
visual representations of the data, the articulation of
the inconsistencies present in the databases analyzed,
and the campus and community relationships formed.
Yet in comparison to other forms of ongoing commu-
nity-based participatory research that might involve
prolonged policy work or coalition building,13 we
acknowledge the constraints present in the particular
counter-data action we chose.
Despite these limitations, it is worth noting that the
methods at the hackathon can serve as examples for at
least preliminary communal connection with and deeper
understanding of data. Ultimately, we believe that more
work is necessary for a counter-data action such as this to
have a prolonged impact on how public understandings
apply a critical perspective to POIH data. Two outcomes

that represent a step in this direction are a branch-off
project being conducted by two of the authors currently,
as well as an ongoing relationship with the Stop LAPD
Spying Coalition. First, two of the authors of this paper
are working to build off these findings to inform the cre-
ation and implementation of a police harassment report-
ing mobile application for students on the UCLA
campus, a project that will ideally extend the reach and
impact of this discussion in a variety of physical and
affective ways. Second, the ongoing relationship of the
authors with the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition as an out-
come of the hackathon has led to a public panel on issues
of data, surveillance, and policing, and also a role in the
development of a data justice project as part of the coali-
tion's efforts to regain control of data collected about
community members by the police. These outcomes are
the beginnings of what we hope will continue to develop
into beneficial counter-data projects that aid in sustaining
a bridge between this type of academic work and the
work of community organizers and coalitions.
Conclusion
The dimensions of data explored by critical data studies
are key in helping us as a society to understand how
data is produced and how it does work in the world,
especially in relation to circumstances surrounding the
development and use of POIH data. It is difficult to
know how data is developed and how, by its very exist-
ence--however incomplete--it affects wider under-
standing of the phenomena these data are supposed
to represent or encapsulate. Engaging with this data
in counter-data actions at local levels, would, as we
have found with our hackathon, remedy widespread
problems relating to the rhetoric framing data as
unquestioned truth or a true reflection of the world.
These counter-data actions are useful for the commu-
nities increasingly affected by data-based governance,
as they are a juncture at which citizens can better
understand why data is produced and the processes
by which it is generated, and that arguments pointing
to data are not unassailable.
For example, President Obama's Police Data
Initiative seeks to set open data standards that pre-
scribe reporting procedures for law enforcement agen-
cies (McCarthy, 2015a; Obama, 2015). The produced,
stored, and disseminated data would be part of a larger
assemblage under the auspices of the open data move-
ment--a constellation that involves open formats, open
software, open data institutions (such as Code for
America and the Open Knowledge Foundation), and
open data principles--which will possibly shape the
presentation of this data in the future, if not the com-
plete production of the data itself. California is leading
in this trend; it published its POIH data online as an
open dataset from the California Department of Justice
in September 2015. It will be interesting to adherents of
critical data studies and data science to follow how this
effort continues to develop and its effects on govern-
ance and law enforcement.
Yet, even if states follow suit and publish open
POIH data, it is likely that data collection practices
will continue to differ across states. Many states will
still not bother to collect the data because they are
not legally bound to. We argue that interrogating the
data at the level of infrastructure, production, storage
and dissemination and finding discrepancies in these
levels in community-based, counter-data actions can
frame where there are tensions in the various official
state accounts. These differences suggest which

Currie et al. 11
questions should be asked of this data--what are the
interests, standards, procedures, and ideologies
involved with the construction of the data, and then
how can these be meaningfully communicated? These
counter-actions can provide an alternate mode of
knowledge production in which communities can inter-
act with and interpret qualitative and quantitative data
in creative or unexpected ways. As such, we argue that
critical data studies expand its gaze to more thoroughly
develop modes of counter-data action that take ser-
iously the interpretation and representation of know-
ledge gained through working with sensitive data sets.

Notes
1. Even so, both the press and scholarly research have used
federal data about POIH to represent the complex pro-
cesses that lead to these homicides. Data from the FBI,
in particular, is widely cited by the press, though with
ample cautions about its validity. USA Today, through
an analysis of FBI data, reported on the disconcerting
racial demographics of such killings, as ``nearly two
times a week in the United States, a white police officer
killed a black person during a seven-year period ending in
2012.'' (Johnson and Hoyer, 2014).
2. A Washington Post analysis based on the FBI data found
that officers are increasingly using rifles over handguns in
justified fatalities (Bump, 2014).
3. Research in sociology and public policy have likewise
relied on these statistics to make assessments and predic-
tions of the use of deadly force overtime and across
jurisdictions.

sity website: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAC

6. Luciano Floridi claims that the concept of ``big data'' in
particular changes everything about the way we construct
and communicate knowledge, because as more data is
generated in relation to processes, things and ideas, it
changes the information ecology in which humanity
exists. Floridi claims that the ubiquity of data grants it
a certain type of objectivity that often remains unques-
tioned--with enough data on a certain process, thing or
idea, people take the data as fact and no longer bother to
look deeper into how and why the data exists in the first
place. As data assumes immanence, it is regarded simply
as part of the information ecology in which we exist
(Floridi, 2010).
7. These details include jurisdiction; month and year; situation
type; the age, sex, and race of the victim and the offender;
the weapon used in the homicide; the relationship of the
victim to offender; and the circumstance surrounding the
offense (e.g. argument, robbery, gang-related).
8. Audits and scholarly reports that cross-reference these
two datasets have shown that none contain the same
results for the same deaths. Glaringly, according to an
audit report by BJS, the FBI's count was dismally low,
capturing 46% of the total from 2003 to 2009, plus
2011; BJS itself captured only slightly more, with 49%
during the same time period. The two databases com-
bined missed an average of 263 homicides by law
enforcement each year, though not usually the same
ones. While BJS ARD data captured more deaths at
the aggregate level, it often trailed behind SHR figures
once scaled down to individual state reporting. A BJS
study from 2007 found California's SHR figures
counted a total 352 justifiable homicides by police offi-
cers over three years (i.e. 2003­2005), while the BJS data
captured just 160. ARD and SHR counts both missed
over half the total between 2003 and 2009. Another
study found that nationally, the SHR estimate was
29% larger than the NVSS estimate, but when dialed
down to the state-level this trend was reversed, with
more deaths reported in the NVSS. (Enten, 2012;
Loftin et al., 2003; Mumola, 2007)
9. The results are available at http://www.poihomicides.org/
10. The specifics of each of these traces are described in further
detail in an earlier conference paper (Currie et al., 2015).
11. This classification leaves out deaths on Native American
reservations, in federal prisons, or on military bases; as a
count for state law enforcement agencies only, it leaves
out actions by federal agencies, such as FBI, DEA, or
Marshals Service.
12. Death by legal intervention is defined as ``injuries
inflicted by the police or other law enforcement agents,
including military on duty, in the course of arresting or
attempting to arrest lawbreakers, suppressing disturb-
ances, maintaining order, and other legal action.''
13. One example of this kind of work is Public Participation
GIS, which engages communities in practices related to
GIS data, particularly with the goal of empowering mar-
ginalized populations.
