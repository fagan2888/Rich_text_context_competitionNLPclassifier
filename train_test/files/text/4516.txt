Introduction
Severe overeating is a common eating disorder where the
urge to eat more has spiraled out of control (National
Institute of Mental Health, 2012). In the United States, life-
styles are fast paced, food is plentiful, and social situations
are often centered on food. Bulik and Taylor (2005) defined
overeating as eating more than the body needs to maintain
health and a normal body weight, whereas Popkess-Vawter,
Brandau, and Straub (1998) defined it as the taking in of
excessive food without hunger until feeling physically
uncomfortable. The consequence of overeating is often the
serious public health problem of obesity. The cost of obesity
totals US$147 billion annually and accounts for 9.7% of all
medical spending (Flaskerud, 2010). The psychological and
behavioral factors surrounding overeating are noted fre-
quently in the literature; however, these are not emphasized
in most prevention and treatment programs for overeating
(Bulik & Taylor, 2005; Gambon & DeLuca, 2008; Linde
et al., 2004; Meyer, 1997, Wyatt, Winters, & Dubbert, 2006).
Considering the cost, fiscally, physically, and psychologi-
cally, more effective treatment for eating disorders should be
a priority for behavioral health and mental health nurses
(Roman & Reay, 2009).
Codependency was a term first used in the chemical
dependency literature to describe the dysfunctional pattern
of behavior of an individual in a relationship with another
person who is addicted to alcohol (Cermak, 1986a). Many
descriptions of codependency exist in the literature. Most
agree that it is a learned behavior from surviving
in a dysfunctional family of origin with resulting neglect of

Abstract
Overeating is a common eating disorder and often leads to obesity and to significant physical, emotional, and social problems
often warranting nursing care. Codependency has expanded beyond the chemical dependency field and describes the
dysfunctional pattern of behavior of an individual in a relationship with another person or from survival in a dysfunctional
family of origin.The psychological and behavioral factors surrounding overeating are noted frequently in the literature but are
not emphasized in most overeating treatment programs.Anxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity are the psychological
problems often linked with overeating and codependency. The purpose of this study was to test the Codependency-
Overeating Model (COM) by examining the relationship between overeating and codependency, anxiety, depression, anger,
and compulsivity. The variables were measured with the Overeating Questionnaire, Codependency Assessment Tool, and
Symptom Checklist-90-R.This study used a model-testing correlational design with 567 students recruited from a Mississippi
community college. Pearson's product­moment correlations noted weak correlations between age and anxiety (r = .12), age
and depression (r = .20),age and compulsivity (r = .20),codependency and anxiety (r = .12),and codependency and anger (r =
.16).No significant correlations were noted between overeating and codependency,anxiety,depression,anger,or compulsivity.
Although the predictive relationships were not verified in the model, several important ways to minimize limitations in future
studies were identified.The development and testing of the COM was the beginning step in pursuing a solid understanding of
overeating and codependency and a catalyst for worthwhile future research.

personal needs; focusing on another person's needs, feelings,
and behavior; and a dependency on others for emotional sup-
port and approval. Those suffering with codependency have
boundary and control issues, low self-worth as well as physi-
cal, emotional, and psychological consequences. Individuals
suffering with codependency are susceptible to stress-related
medical problems as well as psychological problems
(Cermak, 1986b; Crothers & Warren, 1996; Hughes-Hammer,
Martsolf, & Zeller, 1998a, 1998b; O'Brien & Gaborit, 1992;
Wegscheider-Cruse & Cruse, 1990; Whitfield, 1991). The
concept of codependency has expanded past the addiction
field. Codependency has been described in situations inde-
pendent of chemical addiction and has been found to engen-
der susceptibility to a myriad of health problems (Cermak,
1986a; Schaef, 1986; Wegscheider-Cruse, 1985; Whitfield,
1991). Anxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity are the
psychological problems most frequently noted in the litera-
ture associated with overeating and codependency (Cullen &
Carr, 1999; Fischer, Spann, & Crawford, 1991; Gotham &
Sher, 1996; Hinkin & Kahn, 1995; Hughes-Hammer et al.,
1998a; Slochower, Kaplan, & Mann, 1981).
Three studies were found that suggest a connection
between codependency and overeating; however, they did not
specifically address overeating behavior (Allison, 2005;
Meyer, 1997; Meyer & Russell, 1998). Meyer (1997) exam-
ined anorexia and bulimia, whereas Meyer and Russell (1998)
examined eating disorders, particularly bulimia. Allison
(2005) assessed the influence of codependency and binge
eating on body mass index (BMI). There is a gap in the litera-
ture regarding the relationship between overeating, codepen-
dency, and many potential confounding variables. To begin to
address this gap, the Codependency-Overeating Model
(COM) was developed to provide enhanced knowledge of the
connections between these phenomena. Mental health nurses
and other health care providers are in a unique position to use
successful interventions. The purpose of this study was to test
the COM by examining the relationships between overeating
and the predictor variables of codependency, anxiety, depres-
sion, anger, and compulsivity.
COM
The COM offers a framework for exploring proposed rela-
tionships between overeating and codependency. The sub-
stantial problem of overeating, the connection between
codependency and disordered eating along with the scar-
city of relevant empirical studies calls for more research in
this area. The COM was developed to clarify the proposed
relationship between codependency, overeating, and the
psychological problems of anxiety depression, anger, and
compulsivity.
The nursing theoretical perspective for the development
and testing of the COM as a nursing research concern was
provided by the Neuman Systems Model (NSM). The review
of literature revealed that stressors are the origin of
codependency and overeating. Neuman's model illustrates a
system in which nursing is concerned with the total person,
their stressors, and the possible reactions to those stressors.
According to the NSM, health problems are a concern to
nursing, along with all the variables that affect a client's
response to stressors (Neuman, 1982). Guided by the NSM,
a nurse can plan interventions to identify stressors, affect cli-
ent responses to stressors, decrease client exposure to actual
and potential environmental stressors, and assist clients to
adequately cope with stressors.
The COM was developed from the Hughes-Hammer
et al.'s (1998a) Model of Codependency. Hughes-Hammer
et al.'s model was guided in part by the Wegscheider-Cruse
and Cruse's (1990) Codependency Model. The literature was
searched for correlations between the factors proposed in the
model. Review of relevant empirical studies led to the final
COM (Figure 1). The Hughes-Hammer et al.'s (1998b)
Model of Codependency is presented in Figure 2.
Method
Design and Research Questions
This study used a predictive model-testing correlational
design to examine the overall predictive value of the COM
and specifically the relationships between overeating, code-
pendency, anxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity and
selected demographic- and health-related variables. The
specific research questions addressed were as follows:
Research Question 1: Did codependency, anxiety,
depression, anger, or compulsivity predict overeat-
ing?
Research Question 2: Did any single codependency
symptom predict overeating? (Codependency symp-
toms included family of origin issues, other focus,
self-worth, hiding self, and medical problems.)
Research Question 3: Did age, sex, race, personal his-
tory with drugs/alcohol, previous hospitalizations
for mental health problems, or selected medical
conditions predict overeating?
Research Question 4: Were the causal paths to overeat-
ing in the predictive model supported? What model
of predictor variables best predicted overeating?
Sample and Setting
This study used a stratified cluster random sampling tech-
nique. The sample was stratified by campus with a random
selection of class sections chosen from all introductory psy-
chology and sociology students within each campus and
among online students. Based on the number of students
enrolled in each campus and the online classes for psychology
and sociology, the required participation from each campus
and online class was proportionally assigned and randomly
Bynum et al. 3
chosen by computer based on the class section number. The
sampling frame included 1,653 students from three cam-
puses enrolled in psychology or sociology classes in a
Mississippi (MS) community college. Students were eligible
to participate if between the ages of 18 and 65 years and
were not enrolled in the college's nursing program where the
researcher is a faculty member.
The students were stratified by campus, with random
selection of class sections. This sampling approach pro-
duced 1,273 potential participants. However, due to stu-
dent's absences and withdrawal from classes, questionnaires
were given to 810 students. A total of 602 participants
returned the questionnaires (response rate = 74.3%) and
567 participants completed all four questionnaires (response
rate = 70%).
Instruments
Overeating. Overeating, the variable of interest, was mea-
sured with the Overeating Questionnaire (OQ), an 80-item
self-report questionnaire published by Western Psychologi-
cal Services (O'Donnell & Warren, 2010). The OQ measures
the key habits, thoughts, and attitudes related to obesity. The
overeating score relates to the tendency to continue to eat
even after hunger is satisfied. The items contributing to the
overeating score included the following: "I always eat too
much; I can't say no to food at parties; If there is food left
after a meal, I finish it rather than put it away; I feel I should
always eat everything on my plate; I have gone on an eating
binge; I hide the fact that I eat too much from other people; I
stuff myself when I eat; I have trouble controlling how much
I eat." Cronbach's alpha for the OQ ranged from .79 to .88
with .80 for the Overeating scale. Test­retest reliability
ranged from .64 to .94 with the Overeating scale reported as
.64. The validity of the OQ is documented in the OQ manual
(O'Donnell & Warren, 2010). The overeating raw score was
converted to a T-score by hand on each participant's profile
sheet. The T-score is a normalized standard score with a
mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10. The score
provides a comparison of an individual's scores with the
average performance of the normative group on which the

scores are based. Raw- and T-scores were entered into Excel
with T-scores categorized into low, average, high, and very
high.
Codependency. Codependency scores were calculated
from the Codependency Assessment Tool (CODAT), a
25-item 5-point Likert-type scale. The participants were
asked to circle how they feel as indicated by the item on a
scale from 1 = rarely or never to 5 = most of the time. To
prevent response-set bias, one item is reversed-scored.
Scoring for the CODAT includes a total score calculated by
summing the responses on all 25 items. The possible range
of scores is 25 to 125 with minimal codependency score =
25 to 50, mild codependency = 51 to 75, moderate codepen-
dency = 76 to 100, and severe codependency = 101to 125.
Subscale scores can also be calculated, with a range of 5 to
25 for each scale. Subscales include Other Focus, Self-
Worth, Hiding Self, Medical Problems, and Family of Ori-
gin. Reliability data for the CODAT including test­retest
reliability and alpha, respectively, is as follows: Other
Focus/Self-Neglect = .86/.85, Self-Worth = .90/.84, Hiding
Self = .78/.80, Medical Problems = .94/.75, and Family of
Origin issues = .90/.81 with total scale reliability of .90/.91
(Hughes-Hammer et al., 1998b). Detailed information
regarding the development of the CODAT and the estab-
lishment of instrument validity was reported by Hughes-
Hammer et al. (1998b). Demographic- and health-related
information collected with the CODAT included gender,
age, race, religion, marital status, number of children,
employment status, level of education, past or present men-
tal health problems, and past or present alcohol or drug
problem for self, parents, spouse, or significant other
(Hughes-Hammer et al., 1998b).
Anxiety, depression, anger, and compulsivity. The psycho-
logical problems of anxiety, depression, compulsivity, and
anger were measured with the Symptom Checklist-90-R
(SCL-90-R), a 90-item multidimensional questionnaire
published by Pearson Education, Inc. (Derogatis, 1994).
The answers to the paper and pencil questionnaire were
entered into Q LocalTM, a computerized scoring and report-
ing system. Item verification was completed for each ques-
tionnaire. An interpretive report was generated with the raw
and T-score entered into the spreadsheet. The depression
score reflects a range of the manifestations of clinical
depression, including symptoms of dysphoric mood and
affect, feelings of hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, and other
cognitive and somatic correlates of depression. The anxiety
score includes the general signs and somatic correlates of
anxiety. The hostility score reflects the thoughts, feelings, or
actions characteristic of anger. The obsessive-compulsive
score focuses on thoughts, impulses, and actions identified
with obsessive-compulsive clinical syndrome and measures
compulsivity. Internal consistency scores on a 1976 study
ranged from .77 for psychoticism to .90 for depression with
a 1988 study documenting a range of .84 for interpersonal
sensitivity to .90 for depression. Test­retest reliability for a
1983 study cites a low of .78 for hostility to a high of .90 for
phobic anxiety. A 1988 study documents a range of .68 for
somatization to .83 for paranoid ideation and test­retest reli-
ability for the Global Severity Index (GSI) as .84. The
establishment of validity for the instrument is detailed in the
manual for the SCL-90-R (Derogatis, 1994).
Data collection procedure. After approval from the com-
munity college president and the university Institutional
Review Board, the psychology and sociology instructors
were contacted for a convenient time during class for stu-
dents to complete the questionnaires. If faculty could not
give class time for completion, the researcher was allowed
enough time to explain the study with a locked box placed
in the faculty's office for return of the questionnaires. All
potential participants were given an oral and written descrip-
tion of the study with assurances about confidentiality and
their right to refuse to participate. The cover letter also
informed the participants that consent was implied by the
completion and return of the questionnaire. The students
were given the option of participating in a random drawing
for three US$100 Wal-Mart gift cards as incentives to par-
ticipate. The researcher was the sole data collector and the
only individual with access to the questionnaires before
identifying information was removed.
Data analyses. The data were entered into SPSS (Version
19). Auditing was completed with error rate <2%. Descrip-
tive statistics were used to describe the sample. Correlations
were tested using Pearson's coefficient of correlation (Pear-
son's r).
Results
Description of the Sample
Of the 567 participants completing all four questionnaires,
372 (65.7%) were women and 194 (34.3%) were men. One
participant listed gender as "other" (0.2%). The participants
ranged between 18 and 56 years of age (M = 22.7, SD =
6.81). The majority of students were between 18 and 21
years of age (68.7%), White (64.6%), freshmen (54.7%),
single (81.7%), Christian (75.3%), and without children
(64.7%). Most of the participants were Mississippi resi-
dents (95.1%) and employed (59.8%), with food service the
most frequently listed occupation at 10.9% and a personal
income less than US$10,000 (63.7%). The majority was
underweight (11.6%) or normal weight (40.6%) with 24.5%
overweight and 23.3% obese. Fifteen participants were
pregnant (2.6%), and 94.5% reported not having an eating
disorder. Twenty-seven participants (4.8%) stated they had
previous hospitalizations for mental health problems.
Seventy-three participants (12.9%) reported having a per-
sonal history of alcohol or drug abuse (past or present), 64
(11.3%) reported having a spouse or significant other with
a present or past history of alcohol or drug abuse, and 140
(24.7%) reported parents with a present or past history of
Bynum et al. 5
alcohol or drug abuse. See Table 1 and Table 2 for the
demographic- and health-related characteristics of the
sample.
Description of Overeating
Overeating T-scores ranged from 2 to 78 (M = 48.84,
SD = 10.42). Overeating was reported by 14.3% of the par-
ticipants with 85.6% reporting scores indicating they were
not overeaters. Of the participants scoring in the overeating
category, 65 (11.5%) scored "high" and 16 participants
(2.8%) scored "very high." The majority of participants
(83.6%) scored <60T on the Defensiveness (DEF) scale,
which indicates accuracy in responses. Likewise, the major-
ity of Inconsistent Responding (INC) scores (90.3%) were
4, indicating that the responses were an accurate descrip-
tion of self. Significant differences were noted when over-
eating was cross-tabulated with age. A greater incidence of
high overeater scores was reported by the 22+ group
(16.4%) compared with the 20 to 21 (11.2%) and the 18 to

19 age group (7.6%). The very high overeater scores were
reported by 4.5% of the 20 to 21 age group, compared with
1.9% by the 18 to 19 age group and 2.3% by the 22+ age
group.
Description of Codependency
Codependency scores ranged from 25 to 121 (M = 47.87, SD
= 15.75). Only four participants (0.7%) scored in the severe
codependency category; therefore, the moderate and severe
categories were combined. Significant differences were
noted when codependency was cross-tabulated with race,
academic standing, hospitalization for mental health prob-
lem, and past or present alcohol/drug problem (personal,
spouse/significant other, and parents). Mild codependency
was reported by 32.1% of the White participants compared
with 21.3% of the Black participants, while 7.4% of Whites
reported moderate/severe levels of codependency compared
with 3.8% of the Black participants. The sophomore stu-
dents also reported a higher incidence of mild codependency
(32.7%) compared with the freshman students (26.1%) with
10.4% of the sophomores reporting moderate/severe levels
compared with 2.3% freshman. In the participants reporting
a previous hospitalization for mental health problems,
33.3% reported mild codependency compared with 29.4%
by the group that had never been hospitalized. The group
with previous hospitalizations reported 22.2% moderate/
severe codependency levels compared with 5.3% by the
group that had never been hospitalized. The participants
with a past or present alcohol/drug problem for self, spouse/
significant other, or parents reported a greater incidence of
mild and moderate/severe levels of codependency compared
with the group with no past or present problem with sub-
stance abuse. Thirty-five percent of those with a personal
drug/alcohol problem reported mild codependency com-
pared with 28.1% of those with no problem, whereas 19.2%
with a personal drug/alcohol problem reported moderate/
severe codependency compared with 4.3% of those with no
problem. Thirty-four percent of those with a spouse or sig-
nificant other drug/alcohol problem reported mild codepen-
dency compared with 28.2% of those with no problem,
whereas 15.6% with a spouse/significant other drug/alcohol
problem reported moderate/severe codependency compared
with 5.1% of those with no problem. Forty percent of those
with a parental drug/alcohol problem reported mild code-
pendency compared with 25.4% of those with no problem,
whereas 12.1% with a parental drug/alcohol problem
reported moderate/severe codependency compared with
4.3% of those with no problem.
Description of Anxiety, Depression,Anger, and
Compulsivity
Anxiety scores ranged from 37 to 81 (M = 57.04,
SD = 12.70). There were 201 (35.4%) participants with
anxiety T-scores  63. Depression scores ranged from 34 to
81 (M = 60.02, SD = 10.87). There were 235 (41.4%)
participants with depression T-scores  63. Anger (noted as
hostility on the SCL-90-R) scores ranged from 40 to 81
(M = 58.97, SD = 11.68). There were 215 (37.9%) partici-
pants with anger T-scores  63. Compulsivity (noted as
obsessive-compulsive on the SCL-90-R) scores ranged
from 37 to 80 (M = 62.12, SD = 10.74). There were 299
(52.7%) participants with compulsivity T-scores  63.

Relationship BetweenVariables
When selected demographic characteristics of the sample
were correlated with the variables of anxiety, depression,
compulsivity, and anger, a weak correlation was found
between age and anxiety (r = .12), depression (r = .20), and
compulsivity (r =.20); otherwise, no significant correlations
were found. A weak correlation was found between code-
pendency and anxiety (r = .12) and between codependency
and anger (r = .16).
Testing of the COM
Related to Research Question 1, there were no significant
correlations between overeating and any of the variables;
therefore, codependency, anxiety, depression, anger, or com-
pulsivity did not predict overeating. Related to Research
Question 2, no significant correlations were noted when
codependency symptoms were correlated with overeating.
Related to Research Question 3, no significant correlations
were found when personal history with drugs/alcohol, previ-
ous hospitalizations for mental health problems, or medical
conditions were correlated with overeating; therefore, these
demographic- and health-related characteristics did not pre-
dict overeating. Related to Research Question 4, no signifi-
cant correlations were found between codependency, anxiety,
depression, anger, compulsivity, and overeating; therefore,
the causal paths to overeating in the predictive model were
not supported.
Discussion
The literature on overeating and codependency has sum-
moned further clarification. In the 2001 article "Is
Codependency a Meaningful Concept," Stafford (2001)
called for more research aimed at further validation of the
codependency construct. Codependency continues to be
criticized in the literature as a weak theory lacking an effec-
tive operational definition. Although it has been asserted that
no single theory adequately accounts for the development or
treatment of overeating as an eating disorder, it is considered
a serious disorder and effective treatment should be one of
the top priorities for behavioral health (Roman & Reay,
2009). The current study was undertaken to examine the
relationship between overeating and codependency to address
concerns about both of these issues. Although the results of
this current study did not substantiate the predicted relation-
ships in the COM, several worthwhile findings were revealed
that contribute to the literature regarding codependency and
overeating.
The majority of participants in this study reported mini-
mal codependency, which supports the findings in the litera-
ture that codependency is not a widespread problem in the
general population (Martsolf, 2002; Martsolf, Hughes-
Hammer, Estok, & Zeller, 1999; Martsolf, Sedlak, &
Doheny, 2000). In the current study of students enrolled in a
community college in the mid-south, codependency scores
were higher in the White participants, those with mental
health hospitalization histories, and with previous or
past alcohol or drug problems for self, significant others, or
parents. These discoveries about the prevalence of code-
pendency are congruent with findings from other studies
(Gotham & Sher, 1996; Hughes-Hammer et al., 1998a).
Data analysis in this study found a weak correlation between
codependency and anxiety, and between codependency and
anger, which is consistent with the findings in past literature
(Cullen & Carr, 1999; Fischer et al., 1991; Gotham & Sher,
1996; Hinkin & Kahn, 1995). No significant correlation was
found between codependency and depression, or between
codependency and compulsivity in this study, a finding that
is inconsistent with other studies in the literature (Cullen &
Carr, 1999; Gotham & Sher, 1996, Hinkin & Kahn, 1995;
Hughes-Hammer et al., 1998a). Reasons for the incongru-
ence in findings could include use of different instrumenta-
tion for data collection and dissimilar demographic- and
health-related variables. The sample in this study consisted
of healthy nonpatients, the majority of whom were young,
White, and single.
Although the COM was grounded in the literature, this
study found no statistically significant relationship between
overeating and anxiety, depression, compulsivity, or anger.
This finding is contrary to the literature that anxiety, depres-
sion, anger, and compulsivity contributed to eating (Arnow,
Kenardy, & Agras, 1992; Ruderman, 1983; Slochower et al.,
1981; Stickney, Miltenberger, & Wolff, 1999). The associa-
tion between codependency and eating issues was noted in
the literature; however, overeating was measured with
instruments other than the OQ, which was used in the
current study. The studies in the literature also differed from
the current study in sample size, ethnicity, mean age, rela-
tionship, and/or weight status. Interestingly, 47.8% of the
participants self-reported they were overweight or obese,
but only 14.3% reported themselves to be overeaters with
their answers to the OQ. Although the INC and DEF scores
on the OQ indicated the participants answered based on
item content with low response bias, the validity of the
instrument to measure overeating is called into question.
A careful research design, sampling plan, and strong
recruitment strategy were used in this study to control the
extraneous variables and secure a representative sample;
however, several limitations were noted. These limitations
include response bias in the self-reported data, testing fatigue
with the use of four instruments, and instrument format and
clarity. The instruments used in this study utilized different
methods of answering the questions, including circling, bub-
bling, filling in blanks, and check marks. Some forms had
perforations, flaps, as well as front-and-back answers, mak-
ing the process somewhat more difficult for some students.
The study findings are generalizable only to the students at
this MS college.
8 SAGE Open
Recommendations for Future Research
Qualitative inquiries are necessary to describe, explore, and
explain the phenomena of overeating. Additional studies are
also needed to develop stronger instruments to measure
overeating. This study could be replicated with more diverse
participants who are more likely to have mild or moderate/
severe codependency levels. As has been noted, although the
prevalence of codependency in the general population is
relatively low, it does create significant life disruptions for
those who are touched by its presence (Whitfield, 1991).
Therefore, any research designed to examine codependency
in relation to other variables needs to draw on a target popu-
lation likely to be susceptible to codependency. In addition,
recruiting participants from addiction treatment centers, eat-
ing disorder (overeating) clinics, or psychology practices
that treat codependency or eating disorders could enhance
the sample characteristics.
Summary
A model of overeating has been carefully constructed to
portray literature-based propositions about the complex
interrelations between overeating and codependency, medi-
ated and moderated by selected demographic- and psycho-
logical characteristics. This article describes the initial
attempt to explore these complex interrelations in a single
study. Although the relationships in the model were not
statistically significant and the predictive relationships were
not verified, the COM can provide a base for nursing
research to guide future studies with different samples, uti-
lizing different instruments, designs, and methodology.
This was a beginning step in gaining understanding of over-
eating and codependency and serves as a catalyst for future
nursing research in this area.
