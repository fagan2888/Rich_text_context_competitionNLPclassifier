Abstract
Background: One hundred percent fruit juice (100% FJ) has been viewed by some as a sweetened beverage with
concerns about its effect on weight. Little regard has been given to the contribution of 100% FJ to diet quality.
Methods: In this study data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to
examine the association of 100% FJ consumption with diet quality in participants 2-5 years of age (y) (n = 1665),
6-12 y (n = 2446), 13-18 y (n = 3139), and 19+y (n = 8861). Two 24-hour dietary recalls were used to determine
usual intake using the National Cancer Institute method. Usual intake, standard errors, and regression analyses
(juice independent variable and Healthy Eating Index-2005 [HEI-2005] components were dependent variables),
using appropriate covariates, were determined using sample weights.
Results: The percentage of participants 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+y that consumed 100% FJ was 71%, 57%, 45%,
and 62%, respectively. Usual intake of 100% FJ (ounce [oz]/day) among the four age groups was: 5.8 ± 0.6, 2.6 ± 0.4,
3.7 ± 0.4, and 2.4 ± 0.2 for those in age groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+y, respectively. Consumption of 100% FJ
was associated with higher energy intake in 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+y; and higher total, saturated, and discretionary
fats in 13-18 y participants. Consumption of 100% FJ was associated with higher total HEI-2005 scores in all age
groups (< 0.0001). In 100% FJ consumers, total and whole fruit consumption was higher and intake of added sugars
was lower in all age groups.
Conclusions: Usual intake of 100% FJ consumption exceeded MyPyramid recommendations for children 2-5 y, but
was associated with better diet quality in all age groups and should be encouraged in moderation as part of a
healthy diet.
Background
Consumption of fruit is associated with a variety of
health benefits including an improved profile of cardio-
vascular disease markers [1], and a reduced risk of
hypertension [2] and some types of cancer [3]. Despite
these health benefits, few Americans consume the
recommended amounts of fruit per day [4-6]. The
MyPyramid recommendations for fruit consumption are
age, gender, and physical activity specific [7]. Recom-
mendations range from 1 cup/day for children 2-3 years
of age (y) to a maximum of 2.5 cups/day for physically
active young males. The fruit requirement can be met
by consuming whole fruit­fresh, frozen, or dried, or
100% fruit juice (FJ); although the Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee (DGAC) recommended that only
1/3 of the recommendation should be met through
100% FJ to encourage fiber intake [8]. The American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that for chil-
dren 1 to 6 y, 100% juice should be limited to 4 to 6 oz/
day, and for older children/adolescents, 7 to 18 y, to
two 6-oz servings of juice per day [9].
Recommendations for consumption of 100% FJ by
children, however, continue to be debated due to con-
cerns about consumption and a potential link with over-
weight/obesity. Although some studies have shown an
association between 100% FJ consumption and weight
[10-13], the majority have not [14-20]. A systematic

review published in 2008 showed no consistent associa-
tion between consumption of 100% FJ and overweight/
obesity in children or adolescents [20]. Studies of weight
and 100% FJ consumption have been primarily in chil-
dren since they are the principal consumers. Few studies
have looked at 100% FJ consumption and weight in
adults [21-23], but there is less concern than in children.
What is often overlooked in the on-going debate
about 100% FJ and weight and the uncertainty of how
much, if any, should be consumed, is the nutrient con-
tribution of 100% FJ to the diet. One hundred percent
fruit juices are nutrient dense [24] and are low in total
fat, SFA, and sodium. One hundred percent fruit juices,
especially grape, cranberry, pineapple, and orange juices,
are high in phytochemicals [25]. They also contain a
wide array of micronutrients, including vitamins A (par-
ticularly in the form of beta-carotene) and C, folate,
potassium, and magnesium. The 2010 DGAC recognized
vitamins A, C, D, and E; phosphorus; magnesium; potas-
sium; and dietary fiber [26] as shortfall nutrients, and in
addition, potassium and dietary fiber were nutrients of
public health concern. Calcium was also a nutrient of
public health concern for children and adolescents 9 to
18 y, and possibly for younger children aged 4 to 8 y, as
well as for adults [26]. For adolescents (and women) of
childbearing potential, folate was also identified as a
nutrient of special concern [26].
Previous studies of children 2-11 y [15] and adoles-
cents 12-18 y [16] found that 100% FJ consumers had
better nutrient intakes and higher intakes of whole fruit
than those that did not consume 100% FJ. Although the
association between 100% FJ intake and nutrient intake
has been established in nationally representative sam-
ples, assessment and comparison of diet quality of 100%
FJ consumers versus non-consumers is lacking. The pur-
pose of this study was to compare the diet quality of
100% FJ consumers with non-consumers in a nationally
representative population.
Methods
Data collection
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is conducted on a continual basis by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. One of the major
objectives of NHANES is to examine the relationship
between diet, nutrition, and health [27]. Details regard-
ing the survey design, content, operations and proce-
dures are available online [28].
Study population and dietary intake
Participants were 2 y and older (n = 16111) from the
2003-2006 NHANES. The study population was divided
into four age groups and then further dichotomized as
consumers and non-consumers of 100%FJ as follows:
children 2-5 y (n = 1184 and 481, consumers and non-
consumers, respectively); 6-12 y (n = 1395 and 1051);
adolescents 13-18 y (n = 1397 and 1742); and adults19+
y (n = 3394 and 5467). Dietary data were obtained from
two 24-hour dietary recalls administered using an auto-
mated multiple-pass method [29,30]. The first was
obtained at the original interview (Day 1) and the sec-
ond (Day 2) was obtained several days later via tele-
phone. Parents/guardians provided the 24-hour dietary
recalls of children 2-5 y; children 6-11 y were assisted
by an adult; all others provided their own recalls. Only
recall data deemed complete and reliable by the USDA
Food Surveys Research Group were included in the ana-
lyses. Pregnant or lactating females (n = 711) were
excluded from the sample. Detailed descriptions of the
dietary interview methods are provided in the NHANES
MEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures Man-
ual, which includes pictures of the Computer-Assisted
Dietary Interview system screens, measurement guides,
and charts used to collect dietary information [31]. Due
to the nature of the analysis (secondary data analysis),
and the lack of personal identifiers, this study was
exempted by the Institutional Review Board of the
Louisiana State University Agricultural Center.
Determination of 100% FJ and nutrient intake
Two survey-specific food composition databases were
used to determine the foods consumed by NHANES
participants. The USDA Food and Nutrient Database for
Dietary Studies (FNDDS) v. 2.0 [32] was used to deter-
mine the nutrient content of foods in 2003-2004
NHANES survey foods, and the FNDDS v. 3.0 [33] was
used to determine the nutrient content of foods con-
tained in 2005-2006 NHANES survey foods.
In this study, 100% FJ was defined according to the
Federal Food and Drug Administration [34], which
means that the juice was squeezed directly from fruit
and that the words "100% juice" were included on the
label. Products reconstituted from concentrate with
water were also considered 100% FJ, although their label
must have included the words "reconstituted" or "made
from concentrate." Juice cocktails, juice punches, juice
drinks, or juice beverages were not considered as fruit
juice in this study, although they contain some juice
[34]. Participants were dichotomized into consumers
and non-consumers of 100% FJ. Further, the amount of
100% FJ consumed was compared with the MyPyramid
recommendation that 100% FJ should not account for
more than 1/3 of total fruit intake per day, which is
equivalent to the following amounts in cups (c) per total
daily energy levels: 0.33 c/1000-1200 kcal; 0.495 c/1400-
1800 kcal; 0.66 c/2000-2600 kcal; and 0.825 c/2800-3200
kcal [7].

Healthy eating index
The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2005) was used to deter-
mine diet quality [35]. The HEI-2005 contains 12 food
components that reflect the recommendations of the
2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Dietary intake is
expressed per 1000 kilocalories for all components
except SFA and sodium, which are fixed recommenda-
tions. The maximum possible score on the index is 100.
The first six components (i.e., total fruit; whole fruit;
total vegetable; dark green, orange vegetable and
legumes; total grain; and whole grain) were scored from
0 to 5 points. The next five components (i.e., milk, meat
and beans, oil, SFA, and sodium) were scored from 0 to
10 points; and the last component of solid fats, alcoholic
beverages, and added sugars (SoFAAS) were scored
from 0 to 20 points. Scores were calculated proportion-
ally, except for SFA and sodium; for these components,
scores were prorated linearly between 0 to 8 and 8 to
10 points (8 and 10 points represented acceptable and
optimal levels, respectively) [36]. Data files used to
calculate HEI-2005 scores were downloaded from
the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion
website [37].
Statistical analyses
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) method was used
to estimate usual intake of selected nutrients and for
HEI-2005 total scores and subcomponent scores. The
two days of intake, using first day sampling weights,
were used to obtain necessary variance estimates. The
NCI SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) macros Mixtran
v.1.1 and Distrib v.1.1 were used to generate parameter
estimates after covariate adjustment and to estimate the
distribution of usual intake via the Monte Carlo method,
respectively. Covariates for these analyses were sequence
of participant's intake (Day 1 or Day 2) and a variable
for weekday/weekend consumption. Differences among
100% FJ consumers and non-consumers were deter-
mined by computing population Z statistics generated
from usual intake variables.
Regression analyses were conducted using the sin-
gle 24-hour recall data (Day 1) to determine the
contribution of nutrients per ounce of 100% FJ con-
sumption. Covariates for the regression analyses were
age, gender, race-ethnicity, and socioeconomic status
(using poverty income ratio). Differences in beta coeffi-
cients were determined and p < 0.05 was deemed
significant. For all analyses study-specific dietary four-
year sample weights [38] were used to adjust the var-
iance for the complex sample design of NHANES
using the statistical package SUDAAN (version 9.0.3
[2007] Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC).
Results
Consumption of 100% fruit juice
The percentage of individuals consuming 100% FJ varied
by age group, with 71%, 57%, 45%, and 62% of children
2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and adults 19+ y, respectively.
Per capita usual intake of 100% FJ (oz) among the four
age groups was: 5.8 ± 0.6, 2.6 ± 0.4, 3.7 ± 0.4, and 2.4 ±
0.2 for those 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y, respec-
tively. Usual intake of 100% FJ (oz) among only those
consuming 100% FJ was higher than per capita intake:
8.5 ± 0.8, 5.4 ± 0.8, 10.0 ± 1.0, and 7.1 ± 0.5 for those
2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y, respectively (data not
shown).
Intake of energy, fiber, added sugars, and fat
Usual energy intake (kcal) of 100% FJ consumers was
1657.6 ± 47.2, 2079.5 ± 52.8, 2718.0 ± 77.5, and 2348.7 ±
47.1; for non-consumers energy intake was 1627.5 ± 72.8,
2089.0 ± 66.9, 2413.5 ± 65.1, 2297.0 ± 29.7 for age groups
2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y, respectively (Table 1).
Fiber intake (g) of 100% FJ consumers was 10.3 ± 0.4,
12.9 ± 0.4, 15.9 ± 0.8, and 16.5 ± 0.4; for non-consumers
intake was 10.2 ± 0.7, 12.9 ± 0.6, 13.2 ± 0.6, and 15.1 ±
0.4 for age groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y,
respectively. Usual intake of added sugars (tsp) by 100%
FJ consumers was 15.3 ± 0.6, 24.1 ± 1.1, 29.5 ± 1.3, and
20.4 ± 0.8; for non-consumers added sugars intake was
18.7 ± 1.2, 27.2 ± 1.8, 32.3 ± 1.3, 23.1 ± 0.6 for age groups
2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y, respectively. Usual
intake of total fat (g) by 100% FJ consumers was 56.5 ±
2.2, 75.9 ± 3.2, 103.3 ± 3.7, and 87.9 ± 1.9; for non-consu-
mers total fat intake was 63.5 ± 3.7, 78.8 ± 2.8, 91.8 ± 2.8,
88.5 ± 1.9 for age groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+
y, respectively. Usual intake of SFA (g) by 100% FJ consu-
mers was 20.9 ± 0.9, 26.9 ± 1.2, 35.9 ± 1.4, and 28.9 ±
0.7; for non-consumers SFA intake was 23.6 ± 1.6, 27.9 ±
1.0, 31.4 ± 0.9, 29.3 ± 0.7 for age groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-
18 y, and 19+ y, respectively. Usual intake of discretion-
ary fat (g) by 100% FJ consumers was 48.0 ± 2.0, 64.4 ±
2.9, 86.3 ± 3.2, 69.9 ± 1.5; for non-consumers discretion-
ary fat intake was 54.9 ± 3.9, 68.0 ± 2.6, 76.7 ± 2.2, 71.2 ±
1.6 for age groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y,
respectively (Table 1).
In all age groups, except those 2-5 y, consumption of
100% FJ was associated with significantly higher intakes
of energy: in 6-12 y (80.9 ± 31.6 kcal; p = 0.0105), in 13-
18 y (252.3 ± 49.9 kcal; p < 0.0001), and in adults 19+ y
(120.9 ± 23.7 kcal; p < 0.0001) (Table 2). Except in the
youngest age groups, consumption of 100% FJ was
associated with higher intake of dietary fiber: 1.3 ± 0.3 g
(p < 0.0001), 2.5 ± 0.4 g (p < 0.0001), and 1.8 ± 1.4 g (p <
0.0001), for the three other age groups, respectively. One
hundred percent FJ consumption was also associated

with lower intake of added sugars (tsp) in all age groups:
-4.6 ± 0.7 (p < 0.0001) in 2-5 y, -2.8 ± 0.7 (p < 0.0001) in
6-12 y, -1.8 ± 0.9 (p = 0.0396) in 13-18 y and -1.0 ± 0.4
(p = 0.0154) in 19+ y, respectively.
Adolescents 13-18 y were the only age group in which
consumers of 100% FJ had a higher intake of total
fat, SFA, and discretionary fat than non-consumers
(Table 1).
Diet quality
The HEI-2005 scores of 100% FJ consumers by age were
53.0 ± 1.2, 49.3 ± 1.7, 49.6 ± 0.9, and 52.6 ± 0.6, for age
groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y, respectively
(Table 3). The HEI-2005 scores of non-consumers by
age were 47.3 ± 2.1, 44.1 ± 1.7, 44.4 ± 1.0, and 47.7 ±
0.5, for age groups 2-5 y, 6-12 y, 13-18 y, and 19+ y,
respectively. For all age groups, consumers of 100% FJ
had higher HEI-2005 scores than non-consumers, even
when HEI-2005 scores were compared across percentiles
(data not shown).
Results of the regression analysis of 100% FJ consump-
tion with total HEI-2005 and HEI-2005 subcomponent
scores by age group are presented in Table 4. Consump-
tion of 100% FJ contributed to the total HEI-2005 score
in each age group by 7.1 ± 0.8, 5.5 ± 0.5, 5.6 ± 0.5, and
5.1 ± 0.3 points, respectively (p < 0.0001 for all). Total
fruit scores were higher in each age group by 1.9 ± 0.1,
1.7 ± 0.1, 2.0 ± 0.1, and 1.7 ± 0.1, respectively (p <
0.001 for all). Whole fruit scores were also higher in all
ages groups by 0.5 ± 0.1 (p = 0.0006), 0.3 ± 0.1 (p =
0.0010), 0.3 ± 0.1 (p = 0.0004), and 0.4 ± 0.05 (p <
0.0001), respectively. The dark green/orange vegetables/
legumes scores were higher in children 6-12 y (0.2 ± 0.1
[p = 0.0007]) and adults 19+ y (0.1 ± 0.1 [p = 0.0030]),
but not in the other age groups (data not shown).
Whole grains scores were significantly higher in children
2-5 y (0.2 ± 0.1 [p = 0.0323]), 6-12 y (0.2 ± 0.1 [p =
0.0011]), and adults 19+ y (0.2 ± 0.1 [p < 0.0001]) (data
not shown). The most significant contribution to the
overall HEI-2005 score was the improvement in the
SoFAAS score: 3.4 ± 0.4, 2.3 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.3, and 1.7 ±
0.2, respectively in the four age groups (p < 0.0001
for all).
The distribution of total HEI-2005 usual intake scores
of consumers and non-consumers of 100% FJ is shown
in Table 5. In all age groups, consumers had a higher
(p < 0.05) HEI-2005 score than non-consumers: 2-5 y
(53.0 ± 1.2 vs. 47.3 ± 2.1), 6-12 y (49.3 ± 1.7 vs. 44.1 ±
1.7), 13-18 y (49.6 ± 0.9 vs. 44.4 ± 1.0), and 19+ y (52.6 ±
0.6 vs. 47.7 ± 0.5).
Discussion
This study showed that the percentage of 100% FJ
consumers was age dependent; children 2-5 y had the
highest percentage of consumers and adolescents 13-18 y
had the lowest percentage of consumers. Diet quality,

determined by the HEI-2005, was better in all age groups
of 100% FJ consumers when compared with non-
consumers.
The age variation of the percentage of 100% FJ consu-
mers is consistent with other studies [15,16]. Reasons
for the high prevalence of 100% FJ consumption in chil-
dren may include participation in the Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC) Program by young children [39]
since 100% FJ is a WIC authorized food in three of the
food packages for children over 11 months of age [40].
Participation in the National School Lunch or Breakfast
Program by older children [41] may also lead to con-
sumption of 100% FJ since these are approved menu
items, and is the only juice product that may be served
in the National School Breakfast Program [42]. It is also
possible the frequency of consumption is lowest in ado-
lescents since they are the least likely age group to con-
sume breakfast [43] and 100% FJ is thought of as a
breakfast food by many consumers. Adolescents who
participate in the National School Lunch program also
have more beverage options than elementary school
children [44] have and may not choose 100% FJ. Studies

have also shown a secular decline in consumption of
100% FJ by adolescents over the past five years [45].
MyPyramid [7] and AAP [9] recommendations state
that 100% FJ can be part of a healthy diet when served
in age appropriate amounts. This study showed that the
usual intake for children 2-5 y exceeded these recom-
mendations. Further studies are needed to assess the
health effects of consuming higher than recommended
levels of 100% FJ, and whether consuming whole fruit
without 100% FJ provides an advantage to consumers.
Recommendations for 100% FJ consumption vary; thus,
caretakers and consumers may be confused and efforts
should be made to reconcile the recommendations
using an evidence-based approach.
MyPyramid recommendations were established, in
part, to encourage fiber intake since modeling studies by
the USDA showed that when 100% FJ was replaced by
whole fruit, fiber intake increased by nearly 37% [8].
Regression analysis did show a modest, but significant
contribution of fiber to the diet from 100% FJ in all but
the youngest age group. That there was no difference in
fiber intake between 100% FJ consumers and non-
consumers suggests that other foods were contributing
fiber to the diet. Usual fiber intake was, however, below
the Institute of Medicine's recommendations [46] in all
age groups in 100% FJ consumers and non-consumers
and foods rich in fiber should be encouraged.
The rationale for the AAP recommendations for 100%
FJ consumption in children and adolescents is not com-
pletely clear, but is in part based on one study that
showed an association of 100% FJ consumption and over-
weight in pre-school aged children [10]. Although con-
cerns about overweight/obesity and consumption of
100% FJ appear unfounded [20], it is important to con-
sume 100% FJ with other foods while maintaining energy
balance. Paradoxically, in all age groups except children
2-5 y, the group that consumed the most 100% FJ, energy
was higher in 100% FJ consumers. The relationship of
weight and 100% FJ consumption was not examined in
this study.
Previous studies have shown that children [15] and
adolescents [16] also had higher intakes of total fruit and
adolescents had higher intakes of citrus, melons, and ber-
ries. These studies have not been conducted in adults.
Moreover, studies have not examined the effect of 100%
FJ intake on overall diet quality. The HEI-2005, used to
assess diet quality, was revised to reflect the 2005 Dietary
Guidelines [47]. The HEI-2005 now reflects all compo-
nents of the MyPyramid eating plan, including grains/
whole grains, fruit/fruit juice, variety in vegetable and fat
types, non/low fat dairy, sodium, and discretionary cal-
ories [35]. Traditionally, population HEI-2005 scores have
been used with a single 24-hour dietary recall [48], but
recently it was shown that it could also be used when
multiple recalls were available [49].
The HEI-2005 scores for this population were lower
than those shown for individuals 2+ y in 2003-2004
[50]. However, the overall scores of those consuming
100% FJ were significantly higher than those not con-
suming juice. Consumption of 100% FJ improved total
HEI-2005 scores in all age groups; by choosing to con-
sume this single food, the HEI-2005 score improved
approximately 10%. However, the total HEI-2005
scores calculated in this study both with and without
100% FJ consumption were still low and needed
improvement.
Consumers of 100% FJ also had improved intake of
whole fruit. When assessing consumption levels, many
studies have combined the intake of fruit and vegetables;
however, those studies reporting fruit separately have
shown that children, adolescents, or adults [4-6,51] did
not meet the fruit recommendation. Data from the
2003-2004 NHANES showed that adult females had the
highest percentage (12.3%) of those meeting the fruit
recommendation; only 8.6% of adult males met the
recommendation [4]. For both genders, the median

number of servings consumed was 0.61 per day [4].
Overall consumption was lowest in pre-adolescent, ado-
lescent, and young adult males [5]. Despite extensive,
coordinated public health campaigns by government
and industry [52], fruit consumption remains low. Con-
sumption of 100% FJ appears to be one way to increase
fruit intake; however, the goal should be to encourage
intake of all types of fruit.
One concern about consumption of 100% FJ in chil-
dren and adolescents is that it may replace fluid milk in
the diet [53]. Regression analyses showed that there was
no difference in the HEI-2005 Milk component score
between consumers and non-consumers of 100% FJ.
This supports findings from previous studies that con-
sumption of 100% FJ was not associated with lower con-
sumption of milk in the diets of children [15,16].
This study did show that in adolescents 13-18 y con-
sumption of 100% FJ was also associated with higher
intake of total, saturated, and discretionary fats. Reasons
for this are not clear, but may reflect the overall poor
eating habits reported in this age group [43,54]. Addi-
tional studies are needed to determine factors leading to
poor diet quality in adolescents.
Limitations
NHANES is a cross-sectional study, thus cause and
effect relationships cannot be determined. Participants
relied on memory to self-report dietary intakes; there-
fore, data were subject to non-sampling errors, including
under- or over-reporting of energy. Parents reported or
assisted their children 2-11 y with the 24-hour recalls;
parents often report accurately what children eat in the
home [55] but may not know what their children con-
sume outside the home [56], which could also result in
reporting errors [57].
Conclusions
This study showed that, with the exception of children
2-5 y, usual intake of 100% FJ was within the MyPyra-
mid recommendations for children, adolescents, and
adults, and the AAP recommendations for children and
adolescents. Among consumers, all age groups exceeded
MyPyramid recommendations for 100% FJ consumption.
Consumption of any amount of 100% FJ was associated
with improved diet quality in all age groups. Due to its
contribution to overall diet quality, 100% FJ should be
recommended to all age groups as a component of a
healthy diet.
