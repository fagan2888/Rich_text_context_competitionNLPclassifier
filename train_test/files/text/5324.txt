Abstract. Many people complain that they do not photograph well. In the present study, we
hypothesised that the self-face is memorized more beautifully than reality, which may result in reports
of being not photogenic. We took photographs of students who were in the same university course
and were familiar with one another. We then magnified or shrunk the size of their eyes (Experiment
1; N 5 10) and their mouths (Experiment 2; N 5 10). We asked the students to select the picture that
seemed most like their classmates' real faces or their own real face. The results showed that there
were significant differences between memories of their own and others' faces. Participants selected
their classmates' real faces to a greater degree than the modified faces. However, participants tended
to select pictures of themselves with magnified eyes and shrunken mouths more often than for their
classmates. In Experiment 3 (N 5 22), more male participants were included and the influence
of gender and mirror-reversed images were examined. We found that there were no significant
differences across gender, and the mirror reversal did not change the participants' selections. The
bias of self-face recognition may reflect different memory processes for the self and others.

1 Introduction
The self-face is one of the most important visual images to people. Most individuals check their faces
in the mirror every morning and take opportunities to view themselves throughout the day. Self-face
is an important aspect of self-representation. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that individuals
are highly sensitive to stimuli relevant to the self. For instance, the self-reference effect, a well-known
phenomenon, indicates that information related to oneself is better recalled than other information
(Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). For instance, Rogers et al. (1977) asked participants to rate adjec-
tives (e.g., "confident") and then tested their memory on these adjectives. They reported that those
words which were rated whether it described the participants themselves were recalled better than did
those which were rated whether it was meaningful.
Recent studies in neuroscience have also shown that self-referential processing has dissociable
structures from the processing of other information within the brain (e.g., Kelley et al., 2002; Keyes,
Brady, Reilly, & Foxe, 2010; Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2011), indicating that knowledge about the self
is unique. Furthermore, self-advantage has also been observed in face recognition. People respond
faster to their own faces than to the faces of others (Keenan et al., 1999; Keyes & Brady, 2000; Tong
& Nakayama, 1999), which also may reflect processing differences between the self-face and other-
face. Ma and Han (2010, 2012) suggested that the faster response time in processing the self-face was
related to implicitly associated positive attributes of self, and positive items are known to be processed
faster than are negative items (e.g., Feyereisen, Malet, & Martin, 1986; Osgood & Hoosain, 1983;
Stenberg, Wiking, & Dahl, 1998).
We see our faces every day in mirrors, and usually search for ourselves first when viewing a pho-
tograph of a group. However, many people complain that their faces look different, and often worse, in
photographs. One possible explanation is that a photograph shows a person how others see them, while
the mirror image shows the reverse. Other explanations include that a camera lens distorts images of
faces by rendering them two-dimensional and static, while mirror images show three-dimensional and
dynamic representations. There is empirical support for the latter theory, with faces in videos being
rated as more flattering than faces in static images (Post, Haberman, Iwaki, & Whitney, 2012). These
theories, however, do not explain why some individuals tend to judge the image of others as more

favorable than the images of themselves. Therefore, we proposed the following: self-face memory is
perceived as more beautiful than the real face, whereas other-face memory is more consistent with that
of the real face. In other words, when an individual compares their memorized self-face with their face
in a photograph, the latter is judged less attractive.
There is empirical evidence that supports this contention: for instance, research shows that self-
referential stimuli hold more attention than do other-face stimuli (Devue, Van der Stigchel, Brédart, &
Theeuwes, 2009; Turk et al., 2013), which influences self-reference memory. Previous studies of false
memories have demonstrated that divided attention reduces false recognition of semantically related
words (Dewhurst, Barry, Swannell, Holmes, & Bathurst, 2007); thus, too much attention may gener-
ate associated false memories during recognition. Self-focused attention and self-consciousness have
also been linked to memory distortions of self-referential information (Djikic, Perterson, & Zelazo,
2005; Walter, 2007). In summary, attention likely increases the certainty of the "made-up mind" and
therefore induces a false memory about the self-face.
Furthermore, Ma and Han (2010, 2012) proposed the implicit positive association theory of self-
advantage during face recognition, which suggests that people implicitly associate positive informa-
tion with the self-face. In other words, people tend to have a positive representation of the self, which
may create an overestimation of their own beauty in their memory. Indeed, individuals tend to overes-
timate their abilities when asked to compare themselves to another group, as demonstrated in studies
of intelligence (Kruger, 1999).
In the present study, we first examined the hypothesis that people would remember their faces as
more attractive than they would perceive their faces in photographs, whereas their memories of others'
faces would be more consistent with the others' real faces. Specifically, we predicted that participants
would most likely select a photograph that had not been modified for their friends, but would be more
likely to choose a photograph of themselves that has more attractive features. To test this hypothesis,
we asked participants to select the real face from a set of photographs of themselves or of their class-
mates. In Experiment 1, we altered (magnified or shrunk) the size of the eyes, while in Experiment 2,
we magnified or shrunk the mouths. We then examined gender differences and the influence of mirror-
reversed pictures in self-face recognition in Experiment 3.
2 Experiment 1
Research has indicated that the eye region has the greater influence on judgments of face beauty than
other parts of the face (e.g., Etcoff, 1999; Kwart, Foulsham, & Kingstone, 2012; Langlois et al., 2000;
Thornhill & Gangestad, 1999). Thus, in the first experiment, we adjusted the size of the eyes in photo-
graphs to manipulate the perceived beauty of the face. Generally, large eyes are viewed as more attrac-
tive, especially in women (Cunningham, 1986). Therefore, we predicted that the participants would
select more pictures with magnified eyes for themselves than for their classmates.
2.1
Methods
2.1.1
Participants
Ten Keio University students (7 females, mean age 5 20.7 years) from the same class participated
in the experiment. The class was held once per week and had been held for three months before the
experiment. The participants were from the same department; thus, they regularly met or encountered
each other outside the classroom and knew each other relatively well. All participants provided written
consent for us to take, process, and reproduce their photographs before participating in the experiment.
2.1.2
Materials
We took photographs of the participants' faces inside the classroom several weeks before the experi-
ment. For each participant, nine photographs were taken from three angles (i.e., front, left-front side,
and right-front side), and in front of three different backgrounds (i.e., a white wall, a blackboard, and a
monitor). Photographs were edited with Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 using the "liquefy" filter. Eyes in the
photographs were magnified or shrunk about 5%, 15%, or 20% (i.e.,  3 levels). Thus, seven pictures
were made from each photograph, including the unmodified one. We called the seven pictures one set.
An example is given in Figure 1 (these pictures were made from a photo of the experimenter and were
not used in the experiment). In total, 90 sets of face pictures from the 10 participants were used in the
experiment.

2.1.3
Procedure
Participants were assessed individually. Before the face recognition task began, participants self-
reported how photogenic they perceived themselves to be ("I am not photogenic") on a Likert-scale
from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). In each trial of the face recognition task, four pictures
randomly selected from each set were lined up on a 22-inch widescreen monitor (resolution: 1680 
1050 pixels). The participants were asked to use the mouse to select the photograph that was most like
the real face of the subject in the pictures. There were a total of 27 trials, including 9 trials of the self-
face and 18 trials of the other-face (two sets of each classmate were randomly used). Proportions of the
presented faces at each modified level were controlled so that they were equal between the self-face
and the other-face. The trials were presented in random order, and the pictures of the faces lined up on
the monitor in a random order. The experiment lasted approximately 10 minutes for each participant.
2.2
Results
The selection rates for each type of face picture chosen by the students are given in Figure 2. Angular
transformations were applied for analysis. First, we conducted a 2  6 analysis1 of variance (ANOVA:
type of face  modification level) to examine the rates of selection. We found a significant main effect
of modification level (F(5, 45) 5 40.43, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.82), and a significant interaction between
modification level and type of face (F(5, 45) 5 3.52, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.28). The type of face main
effect was not significant (F(1, 9) 5 1.68, n.s., h2
p
5 0.16). For post-hoc analysis, Fisher's LSD test
was used to compare the proportion of selections from each condition. The proportion of the self-
face and the other-face selections were significantly different for the unmodified face (p  0.01)
and the 5% magnified eyes (p  0.05). The participants were more likely to choose the unmodified
faces for their classmates, but selected faces with slightly larger eyes for themselves. Moreover, for
the self-face, the selection of the unmodified faces and faces with 5% magnified eyes was signifi-
cantly higher than other modification levels (p's  0.05), but these two did not differ from each other
(p 5 0.64). For other faces, the selection of the unmodified faces was greater than all other modifica-
tion levels (p's  0.01)
Furthermore, the participants spent more time on self-face trial (M 5 12.1 s, SD 5 5.5 s) than on
each other-face trial (M 5 8.5 s, SD 5 2.1 s) (t(9) 5 2.93, p  0.05), indicating that they paid more
attention to the self-face than to other faces. Finally, the mean score for the `not photogenic' question
was 3.4 (SD 5 1.5). This value was not correlated with selection or reaction time.
2.3Discussion
Our proposed hypothesis--that people remember their own faces as being more attractive than
their real face and remember others' faces in a less biased fashion--was supported by the results of
1No participants selected faces with 20% shrunk eyes (i.e., ­3 level), thus only six modification levels
were used in the ANOVA.

the eye region by 5%, 15%, or 20%. The participants were asked to select the picture that seemed most like their
real face or their classmates' real face. From left to right: (a) face with eye area 10% smaller, (b) unmodified face,

179 Wen W, Kawabata H
Experiment 1. For the other-face condition, about 55% of the selections were of unmodified faces,
while the percentage of selections of faces with 5% magnified eyes was 20%, and the selection of
faces with 5% shrunken eyes was 17%. This indicates that the participants were able to recognize their
classmates' real faces from static photographs in the majority of the trials. However, in the case of the
self-face, selection of unmodified faces decreased to 35%, and selection of faces with 5% magnified
eyes increased to 32%. Thus, it seems that individuals perceive their eyes as larger than in reality. In
other words, they perceive their faces as being more attractive. The differences that emerged in face
recognition between the self-face and the other-face appear to indicate that memories of the self-face
and the other-face are distinct. This will be further discussed in the General Discussion.
As mentioned previously, empirical results have indicated that people pay more attention to the
self-face than to the other-face (Devue et al., 2009; Turk et al., 2013). Our findings provide additional
support for this difference in attention as time spent on recognition of the self-face was longer than that
of the other-face, possibly indicating that the participants studied their own face more carefully than
their classmates' faces. However, the additional attention on the self-face resulted in less accurate face
recognition. It may be that excessive attention increased false memory about the self-face.
On the other hand, participants may have simply overestimated the size of their facial features,
rather than their beauty. This may have been the result of viewing their own faces at closer distances.
Furthermore, it is not clear if memory distortion of the self-face is limited to the eyes or also occurs for
other parts of the face. Therefore, we manipulated the size of the mouth instead of the eyes in Experi-
ment 2.
3 Experiment 2
The mouth region is also an important determinant of facial attractiveness (e.g., Cunningham, 1986;
Kwart et al., 2012; Russell, 2003). For example, small chins are positively correlated with attractive-
ness (Cunningham, 1986; Cunningham, Roberts, & Wu, 1995). Moreover, in traditional Asian cul-
tures, a small mouth, thin lips, and a small smile are considered highly attractive (Cunningham et al.,
1995; Dalby, 1983). In Experiment 2, we modified the size of mouth similar to the method used in
Experiment 1, and once again, we asked participants to select the photograph that looked most like the
real face (self or other).
3.1Methods
The same participants who took part in Experiment 1 took part in Experiment 2. They returned to the
testing place approximately two months after the first experiment. Using the original photographs,

another 90 sets of face pictures were created with the regions of the mouth magnified or shrunk by 5%,
15%, and 20%. The procedure was the same as that used in Experiment 1.
3.2Results
The selection rates of each type of face picture by the participants are depicted in Figure 3. As in
Experiment 1, we observed significant differences between memory of the self- and other-faces. The
results of a 2  7 ANOVA (type of face  modification level) revealed a significant main effect
for type of face (F(1, 9) 5 6.42, p  .05, h2
p
5 0.42) and modification level (F(6, 54) 5 18.25,
p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.67). Most importantly, the interaction between type of face and modification level
was also significant (F(6, 54) 5 3.65, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.29). Results of post-hoc tests (Fisher's LSD
test) showed that selection rates for of the 5% shrunken mouth and unmodified mouth were signifi-
cantly different between the self- and other-faces (p  0.05, p  0.01, respectively). Participants
chose the unmodified faces of their classmates more often than they did their own; instead, they tended
to select faces with the 5% shrunken mouth as their own. Furthermore, for the self-face, selections of
the 5% shrunken mouth were significantly higher than any other modification level (p's  0.05). For
other faces, selections of the unmodified mouth were significantly more than those with other levels
of modification (p's  0.01). The main effect for type of face showed that the selections for the other-
face were more than the selections for the self-face, which was a result of angular transformation (the
total selections for all modification levels should be 100% for the self- and other-faces). In addition,
as in Experiment 1, reaction time in the self-face condition (M 5 9.3 s, SD 5 2.1 s) was significantly
longer than that in the other-face condition (M 5 8.0 s, SD 5 1.7 s; t(9) 5 2.69, p  0.05).
3.3Discussion
The results from Experiment 2 replicated the findings of Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the unmodi-
fied faces of classmates were selected in 43% of trials, the unmodified self-faces were selected only
25% of the time. Moreover, the 5% shrunk mouth photographs were selected for 35% of the self-face
trials. We reached two conclusions from the results of Experiment 2: first, individuals do not sim-
ply overestimate the size of their facial features (they underestimated the size of their mouths), and
second, memory distortion of the self-face occurs with other parts of the face.
4 Experiment 3
Previous studies have reported gender biases in face recognition. For example, female participants
recognized female faces better than male faces (e.g., Cross, Cross, & Daly, 1971; Lewin & Herlitz,
Figure 3. The rates of selection of the self-face and other-face for each condition in Experiment 2. Error bars

181 Wen W, Kawabata H
2002; Rehnman & Herlitz, 2006; Rehnman & Herlitz, 2007; Wright & Sladden, 2003). The judgment
of beauty may also differ between men and women (e.g., big eyes may be viewed to be attractive for
the female face, but not for the male face). Therefore, there are reasons to expect gender differences
in the bias of self-face recognition. We were unable to examine gender difference in Experiments 1
and 2 due to the small number of male participants. In Experiment 3, we increased the number male
participants and balanced genders of the other-faces. In addition, we also examined whether a mirror-
reversed self-face (as one sees in mirror) influenced the self-face recognition bias.
4.1
Methods
4.1.1 Participants
Twenty-two participants (12 females, mean age 5 22.9 years) from Keio University took part in this
experiment. They were from the same department as the participants in Experiments 1 and 2, but none
of them had taken part in the previous two experiments. The participants in this experiment knew each
other, but were not as well known to each other as the participants in Experiments 1 and 2. Therefore,
in the present experiment, we defined "others" as known people rather than familiar people.
4.1.2 Materials
The face photographs used in Experiment 1 were also used in this experiment. In addition, we took
photographs of four other male students in the same department, which resulted in photographs of
seven men and seven women. All photographs were edited in Adobe Photoshop CS5 as in Experiment 1
(eyes magnified or shrunk by 3 levels). These prepared pictures were used in the other-face condi-
tion. For the self-face condition, face photographs were taken and edited just before the experiment.
The self-face pictures were only used with the matched participant. In addition, pictures of mirror-
reversed self-faces were made of each participant with the same software.
4.1.3 Procedure
Participants performed the experiment individually. Before the task, participants were shown an A-4
sheet of face photographs used as other-faces were printed (one unedited picture for each person) and
were asked to indicate the individuals they did not know. Only pictures of known people were used in
the face recognition task.
For each participant, nine face photographs were taken, and the experimenter edited the pictures
while the participants waited for about 25 minutes. When the edit was complete, participants returned
to the experiment room and performed the same face recognition task described in Experiment 1
twice. Normal and mirror-reversed pictures of self-face were used in the first and the second session,
respectively. There were 36 trials in each session, including 18 self-face and 18 other-face trials. The
other-face photographs were randomly chosen from known people and proportion of gender was con-
trolled. The experiment lasted approximately 1 hour for each participant, including the waiting period.
4.2
Results
The rates that men and women selected each type of face picture are given in Figure 4. We applied
a mix-designed 2  2  7 ANOVA (gender of participants  type of faces  modification level)
to examine gender differences. An angular transformation was applied for the analyses. We found
significant main effects of gender, type of faces, and modification level (F(1, 20) 5 6.52, p  0.05,
h2
p
5 0.25; F(1, 20) 5 18.60, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.48; F(6, 120) 5 62.20, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.76, respec-
tively), and a significant two-way interaction between type of face and modification level (F(6, 120) 5
4.84, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.19). The gender of participants was not significantly interacted with any other
factor (F(1, 20) 5 0.36, n.s., h2
p
5 0.02 for the two-way interaction between gender and type of faces;
F(6, 120) 5 0.84, n.s., h2
p
5 0.04 for the two-way interaction between gender and modification
level; F(6, 120) 5 1.03, n.s., h2
p
5 0.05 for the three-way interaction between gender, type of faces,
and modification level). The significant main effect of gender was a result of the angular transforma-
tion (the total number of selections by men and women was equal before transformation, but, after
transformation, the total number of selections by women was more than the total number of selections
by men). Post-hoc comparisons (Fisher's LSD test) showed that the participants selected more pictures
with 5% magnified eyes (p  0.01) and fewer pictures with 15% magnified eyes (p  0.01) for the
self-face than for the other-face. In addition, we also examined if the gender of other-face influenced
facial memory. A mixed-designed 2  2  7 ANOVA (gender of participant  gender of other-face 
Differences in face memory for the self and others 182
modification level) revealed only a significant main effect of modification level (F(6, 120) 5 39.66,
p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.66) but no any significant interaction. In summary, neither the gender of participants
nor the gender of other-face interacted with other factors (i.e., type of faces, modification level).
Furthermore, we applied the same ANOVA (gender of participant  type of faces  modification
level) to the results of the mirror-reversed session (Figure 5) and found almost the same results as the
first session. Specifically, we found main effect of type of faces and main effect modification level,
and a significant two-way interaction between type of faces and modification level (F(1, 20) 5 60.37,
p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.75; F(6, 120) 5 60.43, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.75; F(6, 120) 5 12.24, p  0.01, h2
p
5 0.38,
respectively). Moreover, we added the factor of session into the above ANOVA to examine the effect
of session (normal vs. mirror-reversed); neither the main effect of session nor any interaction between
session and other factors was significant, revealing that mirror-reversed pictures did not influence face
recognition. In fact, none of the participants reported noticing that mirror-reversed pictures were pre-
sented in the second session when asked after the experiment.
4.3Discussion
In this experiment, we examined influences of gender and mirror-reversed pictures on the observed
bias in self-face recognition; neither gender nor mirror-reversed pictures affected recognition of the

self-face and other-face. Although some previous studies have reported gender biases in face recogni-
tion (e.g., Cross et al., 1971; Lewin & Herlitz, 2002; Rehnman & Herlitz, 2006; Rehnman & Herlitz,
2007; Wright & Sladden, 2003) and features influencing beauty might differ between women and men,
we did not observe any gender difference in the memory distortion in self-face memory. Both women
and men selected more pictures with 5% magnified eyes for themselves than for other people, and the
gender of the other-face did not influence recognition.
As mentioned in the Introduction, there is possibility that because we view our faces in a mirror
and faces are flipped horizontally in photographs, they appear different. We examined this and found
that the answer was "not true." None of the participants noticed the presentation of mirror-reversed
pictures, and showing mirror-reversed pictures did not influence their recognition. This is probably
because people are very familiar with their self-face in both mirrors and photographs. As shown in
a previous study, people's ability to recognize whether their own face is mirror-reversed or not is no
better than their ability to recognize others' mirror-reversed faces (Brédart, 2003). Although the dif-
ference between the dynamic face in the mirror and the static face in a photograph might influence
attractiveness, left and right reversal does not.
The results from Experiment 3 differ from those of Experiment 1 in two ways. First, selections on
unmodified pictures were equal for self- and the other-faces in this experiment, but less for self than
other in Experiment 1. Second, the selection of pictures with 15% magnified eyes was less for self than
for others in this experiment, but was the same in Experiment 1. These differences may have arisen
due to the differences in participants and procedures. In Experiment 1, all the participants were in the
same small-class lecture and were very familiar with each other. In contrast, the participants in Experi-
ment 3 were from the same department but in different years; they knew each other, but were not that
familiar with the others in the photographs, resulting in poorer performance in face recognition of the
other-faces. Furthermore, photographs of the self-face were taken just before the experimental task in
Experiment 3, possibly resulting in better accuracy in self-face recognition than in Experiment 1. How-
ever, the result that significantly more faces with 15% magnified eyes was selected for other people
than selected for self was still somewhat surprising. This suggests that people may be more generous
with unfamiliar people. Future research should be conducted on this issue.
5 Experiment 4
To confirm that the size of eyes and mouth influences attractiveness for both Japanese men and women,
we asked students who did not know the participants of Experiments 1, 2, and 3 to select the most
attractive face from pictures with different sizes of eyes or mouths.
5.1
Methods
5.1.1
Participants
Twenty students from the University of Tokyo and the Chuo University participated in Experiment 4.
Ten students (5 females, mean age 5 22.5) participated in the investigation on attractiveness of faces
with different sized eyes, and the others (5 females, mean age 5 26.0) participated in the investigation
on attractiveness of different sized mouths. None of these participants knew the participants of the
previous experiments and were naïve to the purpose of the experiment.
5.1.2
Materials and Procedure
The other-face photographs in Experiment 3 were used. All photographs were edited in Adobe Pho-
toshop CS5 as in Experiment 1 (eyes magnified or shrunk by 3 levels) and Experiment 2 (mouths
magnified or shrunk by 3 levels). In each trial, seven pictures with different sized eyes (the first
investigation) or mouth (the second investigation) were randomly presented on a monitor, and partici-
pants were asked to select the most attractive one using a mouse. For each other-face subject, three sets
of photographs were used randomly. Each participant did 42 trials (3 sets  14 subjects).
5.2
Results
The proportions of face selections of pictures of women and men with different sized eyes are given
in Figure 6(a). Women and men both favored larger eyes, although the degree was somewhat different
(larger eyes were favored in women more than in men). The average correlation between the propor-
tions of selections and modification levels were .76 (SD 5 .14) for female faces and .71 (SD 5 .17)
Differences in face memory for the self and others 184
for male faces. A Fisher's z-transformation was applied for the analyses. The correlations significantly
differed from 0 for both female faces (t(9) 5 7.59, p  0.01) and male faces (t(9) 5 8.17, p  0.01).
The difference between female faces and male faces was not significant (t(9) 5 0.63, n.s.).
The proportions of selections of pictures with a different sized mouth are given in Figure 6(b).
Faces with smaller mouths were selected as attractive, and this tendency was more remarkable for
female faces. The average correlations between the proportions of selections and modification levels
were ­.75 (SD 5 .12) for female faces and -.49 (SD 5 .34) for male faces. Both correlations were
significantly different from 0 (t(9) 5 29.36, p  0.01; t(9) 5 23.86, p  0.01, respectively). Further-
more, the correlations did not differ significantly between female and male faces (t(9) 5 1.82, n.s.).
5.3Discussion
In this experiment, we asked the participants to select the most attractive face from pictures with dif-
ferent sized eyes or mouths. The results clearly showed that large eyes and small mouths were viewed
as more attractive, especially in women, in Japanese culture. Therefore, when people selected pictures
with larger eyes or smaller mouths for the self-face, they were remembering their own faces as more
attractive than their real face.
6 General Discussion
The results from Experiment 1 and 2 provided clear evidence that there are differences in face memory
for the self and others. Specifically, participants were able to recognize the unmodified faces of their
classmates, but tended to choose the modified pictures (with larger eyes and smaller mouths) of their
own faces. As confirmed in Experiment 4, larger eyes and smaller mouths are considered to be more
attractive in Asian cultures; therefore, these results may be interpreted to mean that people think of
themselves as more attractive than they really are. This may also provide an explanation for why
many individuals think they are not photogenic: when people see their photographs--an unmodified
view--they compare it to their memorized face, and the resulting incongruence is attributed to a poor
photograph or being "not photogenic."
Herein, we have proposed several possible reasons for the memory distortions of the self-face. The
memory distortions we observed may be the result of over-attention to the self-face. Indeed, previous
work has indicated that self-reference stimuli, including faces, hold attention more than other stimuli
(e.g., Devue et al., 2009; Turk et al., 2013). After the experiments, the participants reported that the
self-face trials were easier to do than the other-face trials, but they took longer during these trials.
Although the participants made more cautious decisions during the self-face trials, their recognitions
were less accurate. Therefore, it may be that too much attention and overexposure to the self-face

may result in the subjective expectation of being more attractive. In addition, as reported by prior
researchers, people implicitly associate positive information to the self-face (Ma & Han, 2010, 2012).
Thus, during the long retention interval of the self-face, positive information (e.g., beauty, attractive-
ness) associated with the self may unconsciously distort an individual's self-representation and lead
to inaccurate face recognition. In addition, the positive biases of self-face recognition might not be
specific for self-face recognition; it might also apply to the faces of people to whom we are strongly
attached. Future research should be conducted on this issue.
Furthermore, previous research has demonstrated that holistic processing leads to better face
recognition than featural processing (e.g., Schooler & Engstler-Schooler, 1990; Schooler, 2002). In
research examining self-face processing relative to familiar face processing, featural processes have
been demonstrated to contribute to the self-face recognition (e.g., Greenberg & Goshen-Gottstein,
2009; Brédart, 2003). In addition, Keyes and Brady (2010) examined interhemispheric cooperation in
the recognition of self-, friend-, and stranger-faces, and concluded that the representation of one's own
face emphasizes both global and local information. From the results of these studies we infer that the
featural processing of the eyes (or the mouth) in this study was influenced by positive beliefs about self.
We also examined the interaction between gender and bias in self-face memory, but did not observe
any gender differences. Both women and men chose slightly magnified eyes for the self-face more
often than for others. As shown in Figure 6(a), although large eyes were preferred more in women than
men, this feature was correlated with attractiveness for both genders. In conclusion, both females and
males remember their own faces as being more attractive than their real face.
We also examined the influence of mirror-reversed pictures on self-face recognition and found that
the photograph selections were not influenced by mirror-reversals self-faces. The participants reported
not noticing the difference in the mirror-reversed photographs. Clearly, mirror-reversal is not the rea-
son of why faces look different in photographs and mirrors.
In conclusion, we found a bias in self-face recognition. Participants selected the more attractive,
modified pictures for the self-face condition than for the other-face condition. This phenomenon did
not differ across gender and indicated a memory distortion (i.e., overevaluation) of the self-face and
offered some insight about how people think about the self.
