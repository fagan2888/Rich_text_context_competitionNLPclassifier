Introduction
Psychopathy is related to criminal behavior revealing violent
social disruption. Neither all psychopaths are criminal nor all
criminals are psychopaths. Individuals with psychopathic
traits are found in every walk of life. There is a significant
representation of the psychopaths in rapists, beaters, crimi-
nals, unlicensed practitioners, child abusers, sexual offend-
ers, mass murderer, serial killers, and cunning leaders
(Copley, 2008b).
In the past few decades, Pakistan has witnessed a rise in
crime rate. The number of crimes committed by Pakistanis
such as robbery, car theft, snatching valuable items, rapes,
gang rapes, and mass murders has been increased. It is
reported that in 2010, 1,672 women were killed, and 539
were raped and then killed; another 179 were raped and 133
were gang raped. (Assadi, 2011). According to a report, most
crimes committed in Pakistan are car theft and mobile snatch-
ing. Most of these crimes are committed by young unedu-
cated individuals aged 16 to 24. Most of the young offenders
soon become recidivists and hardened criminals ("Youth in
Crisis," 2007). In 2014, 329 gang rape and 3,285 rape cases
were reported as most of the cases were reported from Punjab
(Anjum, 2015). According to Butt (2015), 3,508 cases of
child sexual abuse were reported with an increase of 17% in
2014.
According to Daniel (2010), nearly all psychopaths find
themselves in trouble with the law because of their impul-
siveness and inflated sense of self-worth, without consider-
ing the consequences of the crimes they commit. Crimes
such as murders, fraud, forgery, and theft are most common
that are committed by the psychopaths. According to Copley
(2008a), psychopathic children have the habit of stealing,
having sex, taking drug, and being cruel to animals and other
children, and have no fear of punishment.
Psychopaths have been characterized as having superfi-
cial charm and adequate intelligence, also exhibiting features
of poor adjustment such as deviant behavior. Psychopaths act
on impulse; have poor judgment, showing lack of empathy,
remorse, shame; and are insincere. They have poorly moti-
vatedantisocialbehaviorshowingegocentricity.Psychopaths
fail to learn from experience, including punishing experience
(Corr, 2010).
Psychopathy is said to have been associated with delin-
quency, crimes, or aggressive behavior. It is observed that
psychopaths have early criminal careers, commit more vio-
lent and varied types of crimes, and show high rates of recid-
ivism (Hart & Hare, as cited in Sullivan, 1996).
According to Edens, Campbell, and Weir (2007), psycho-
paths display less fear of negative stimulus and a heartless
misuse of others especially for personal benefits, exhibit
severe antisocial behavior that is violent in nature as well,
and show a high rate of recidivism (see also Frick & Dickens,

Psychopathic Inclination Among
Incarcerated Youth of Hazara
Division Pakistan
Sher Dil1 and Farhana Kazmi1
Abstract
Present study aimed at evaluating the psychopathic inclination among youth and finding the gender differences in psychopathy.
An indigenously developed Psychopathy scale (Urdu) has been used in this study. Alpha reliability of the scale was .90. The
study was conducted on 100 males (50 criminals and 50 non-criminals) and 100 females (26 criminals and 74 non-criminals)
using a convenient sampling technique from three districts of Hazara division: Haripur, Abbottabad, and Mansehra. Results
confirmed that there is significant difference in psychopathic inclination of males and females; criminals differed significantly
from the non-criminals. The study also paves way for further investigation in the field in Pakistan.

Rogers, 2008).
It is found in National Comorbidity Survey that 5.8% of
men and 1.2% of women population have lifetime risk of
developing psychopathy. The prevalence rate of serious
criminals stands at 75%. Males score higher as compared
with females and present a larger proportion (Port, 2007).
In the sample used by Harris, Rice, Hilton, Lalumiére,
and Quinsey (2007), 48% of participants were below 16
years, and their age significantly related to the psychopathy
scores. Coid et al. (2009) measured the prevalence rate of
0.06% in household population. Bauer (2001) reported that
prevalence rate of imprisoned females is 26% as compared
with 30% of males imprisoned.
Hare (as cited in James, 2010) reported that 15% to 25%
incarcerated male samples are psychopaths. Salekin, Rogers,
Ustad, and Sewell (1998) pointed out that female psychopa-
thy has a prevalence rate of 15%, and that 25% to 30% of
males are psychopaths.
Psychopathy has been reported higher in adult as well as
juvenile offenders, serial killers, mass murderers. Vaughn,
Newhill, DeLisi, Beaver, and Howard (2008) investigated
the psychopathic features among female delinquents, and
found that interpersonal and affective facets of psychopathy
related with violence and theft.
Psychopathy has also generally been found associated
with recidivism and violence. Hemphill, Hare, and Wong
(1998) reported that there is strong relationship among psy-
chopathy, recidivism, including violent recidivism and sex-
ual recidivism. They found that there is 3 times more risk
involved in committing a crime again.
Buffington-Vollum, Edens, Johnson, and Johnson (2002)
reported that psychopathy is associated with committing vio-
lent offenses within institutions. Similar findings were
reported by Hicks, Rogers, and Cashel (2000) that there was
a high rate of committing a violent infraction among psycho-
paths as compared with non-psychopaths.
Porter, Birt, and Boer (2001) studied the relationship
between commencing violent crimes and psychopathy, and
found that high psychopathic individuals commit more
crimes and carry on doing so after adolescence.
The construct of psychopathy has shifted from adults to
the assessment of juvenile offenders, and its predictive
power of aggressive behavior and violent acts among ado-
lescents (Edens, Skeem, Cruise, & Cauffman, 2001).
Under Juvenile Justice Ordinance 2000, the juvenile was
defined as a child aged between 15 and 18. Pakistan is one
of the countries where juvenile laws are not fully imple-
mented. It is argued that juvenile delinquency has reached
its epic proportion, and both law and society are unwilling
to understand the danger related to it. Most of the children
are kept with adults, which also increases the risk of abuse
or maltreatment (Sarfaraz, 2008). Kausar et al. (2012)
investigated the relationship between juvenile delin-
quency and personality types of delinquents. They studied
both delinquent and non-delinquent youth aged between
16 and 18 years, and found that delinquent youth scored
higher on the psychopathic measure of Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). Fakhar (2014)
argued that Pakistan is one of the countries with higher
rates of juvenile delinquency. She put forward a number
of reasons for the delinquent behavior of youth such as
poor socioeconomic status, parenting styles, and peer
group affiliations. She suggested that the juvenile justice
system should incorporate better policies to address the
need of delinquents. In a study by Gadit, Vahidy, and
Khalid (1997), it was found that 9% of the child offenders
met the criteria for the psychopathy, and there is a poten-
tial risk of continuing it in later adulthood. According to
Cauffman and Skeem (n.d.), juvenile acts sometimes are a
reflection of psychopathic personality rather than simple
acts of immaturity.
It has been argued that adolescence is the period where
changes in developmental maturity have negative relation-
ship with psychopathy (Cauffman & Skeem, n.d.).
According to Rubio, Krieger, Finney, and Coker (2014),
determining juvenile psychopathy has both clinical and
criminal justice applications, and finding out the underly-
ing causes might be helpful in understanding the phenom-
enon. The current study focused on the assessment of
psychopathy among Pakistani-imprisoned youth. The fol-
lowing hypotheses were proposed on the basis of literature
review.
Objective
To measure the level of psychopathic tendencies among
youth
To measure the difference between criminal and non-
criminal youth with reference to psychopathy
To measure the difference in level of psychopathic ten-
dencies on the basis of gender
Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1: Criminals have high inclination for psy-
chopathic tendencies as compared with non-criminals.
Hypothesis 2: Males have higher levels of psychopathic
tendencies as compared with females.
Method
Participants
Participants for the current study were taken from three dis-
tricts of Pakistan: Abbottabad, Mansehra, and Haripur. The
sample comprised two groups: adolescent criminals and non-
criminals. A total sample of 200 individuals was taken from
three districts. Criminals were taken from the prisons and
police stations present in Haripur and Mansehra districts,
with the individuals between 17 and 24 years of age and hav-
ing been convicted for crimes.

Instrument
An indigenously developed scale in Urdu language compris-
ing 70 items was used. The items were rated on a 5-point
Likert-type scale, with responses ranging from strongly
agree to strongly disagree. Items were rated 5 for strongly
agree, 4 for agree, 3 for uncertain, 2 for disagree, and 1 for
strongly disagree. Item numbers 7, 9, 12, 16, 17, 25, 36, 37,
39, 42, 52, 55, and 59 were phrased reverse that scored 5 for
strongly disagree and so forth.
An item pool was generated based on the available con-
struct definitions of the psychopathy (see, for example,
Decuyper, De Pauw, De Fruyt, De Bolle, & De Clercq, 2009;
Hare & Neumann, 2009; Port, 2007; Wynn, Høiseth, &
Pettersen, 2012).
Procedure
The 70-item scale was constructed based on the available lit-
erature. Scale items were assessed by a panel of experts, two
PhD and a PhD scholar for face validity. The scale was pilot
tested on a sample of 20.
The main study was conducted on a sample of 180 indi-
viduals. To conduct the study in prison, permission was
obtained from the respective authorities prior to study.
Participants were approached individually, and after a brief
introduction of the research, their verbal consent was
obtained for the study. After obtaining informed consent,
they were given questionnaires to complete. Filled question-
naires were collected the same day, and participants were
thanked for their participation.
Results
The collected data were statistically analyzed to test the
hypothesis. Alpha reliability of the scale was determined to
check the internal consistency of the scores ( = .90). The t
test was used to check the differences among gender and
criminal status.
Table 2 reveals that there is a significant difference in the
level of psychopathy among criminals and non-criminals.
Mean score of criminals was 259.93 (16.54) as compared
with the mean score of non-criminals, which was 203 (34.63).
The results in Table 3 show that there is a significant dif-
ference in the psychopathy level of males and females, indi-
cating that males scored significantly higher as compared
with the females.
Discussion
Recent interest in the study of the psychopathic profile of
incarcerated and normal individuals, implications of the
assessment procedures to criminal justice systems, and
screening individuals for their violent acts has gained
momentum. The present study is aimed at assessing the
presence of psychopathic inclination among youth. Major
objective of the research was to check the difference in the
level of psychopathy among criminal and non-criminal
youth. The demographic characteristics of the participants
are shown in table 1. It was hypothesized that criminals
would score higher on psychopathy questionnaire. The result
confirmed the hypothesis, and criminal youth significantly
differed from youth who were never convicted or accused of
any crime. The results of the study are consistent with those
of the previous studies. Porter et al. (2001) found that indi-
viduals scoring high on psychopathic measures committed
more crimes as compared with low scoring individuals.
Hemphill et al. (1998) reported that psychopaths are at
increased risk of committing crimes. Salekin, Rogers, and
Sewell (1996) stated that imprisoned individuals have higher
rates of psychopathy and are more likely to commit criminal
violence and recidivism. They also stated that both criminal
violence and recidivism can be predicted by psychopathic
scores. de Pádua Serafim, de Barros, Bonini Castellana, and
Gorenstein (2014) investigated the differences among psy-
chopathic scores of the psychopathic murderers, non-psy-
chopathic murderers, and non-criminals. The results showed
that non-criminals scored lower as compared with both
groups of criminals.
The present study was also aimed at finding the difference
in the level of psychopathy across gender. The results show
that males scored significantly higher as compared with the
females; that is, the score for males on psychopathic measure
was 240.65 (32.173) and that for females was 209.19 (41.00).
The present research findings are consistent with those of pre-
vious research. Essau, Sasagawa, and Frick (2006) reported
that females score less on dimensions of psychopathy as com-
pared with males. Similar findings were reported by Frick
et al. (2003). According to them, boys had a higher score on
callous unemotional dimension of psychopathy as compared
with the girls having committed more delinquent acts.

Frick, Bodin, and Barry (2000) also studied the impul-
siveness and unemotional dimension of psychopathy, and
found that girls scored significantly lower as compared with
females. The results of the present study are also similar to
those of Cale and Lilienfeld (2002) who found that the mean
level of psychopathy in men is higher as compared with the
women. Vitale and Newman (2001) pointed out that females'
scores on psychopathic measure were significantly different
from males'. They tend to score lower as compared with
males. According to Dotterer (2014) males scored higher on
total psychopathy and sub facet scores as compared with
females.
The present study is among few indigenous studies that
focused on the psychopathic traits among Pakistani (see, for
example, Jhatial, Jariko, Tahrani, & Jam, 2013; Kausar et al.,
2012). The importance of assessing psychopathy and its
early identification is really vital.As research evidences have
shown that interventions used at earlier age such as using
decompression model or using increased relationship bond
with peers and parents, are helpful in treating psychopathy
(e.g., Edwards, 2015). Developing such an approach in
Pakistan especially in juvenile justice system and introduc-
ing it in facilities such as Remand Homes, Industrial and
Reform Schools can assist the society in a more productive
way.
Limitations
Like other research, this research has some limitations.Afew
of them are identified during the course of research:
1. The study is conducted on a smaller area, and only
three cities of Pakistan, Abbottabad, Haripur, and
Mansehra were taken.
2. It was observed that the public view of the crimes
differs. Focus group studies are needed to assess
what individuals think about committing crimes and
being criminals. What indices of psychopathy may be
used to assess the level among masses?
3. The data were mainly collected from youth. A more
varied sample is needed to assess the level of psy-
chopathy among normal population.
Implications of Study
The study was conducted to investigate the difference in the
psychopathic level of criminal and non-criminal youth. The
construct of psychopathy is so important that various crimi-
nal offenses and use of instrumental aggression by psycho-
paths demand attention. Psychopaths among normal
individuals are also needed to be assessed and treated. The
study has implications in the criminal justice system and psy-
choeducation, providing an insight to clinicians and educa-
tionists about the construct.
Conclusion
The aim of the study was to assess the level of psychopathy
among youth. The study focused on measuring the difference
in the level of psychopathy among criminal and non-criminal
youth. It also focused on the gender differences with refer-
ence to psychopathy. The sample was taken from three dis-
tricts of the Hazara division. The total sample was 200 youth
(100 males and 100 females). Data were assessed using an
indigenously developed Urdu Psychopathy scale. The scale
consisted of 70 items, and the reliability for the scale was
.90. The results confirmed our hypothesis that criminals
showed higher rates of psychopathy. Similarly, males exhib-
ited more psychopathic traits as compared with females.
