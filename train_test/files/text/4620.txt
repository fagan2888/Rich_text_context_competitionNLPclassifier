Introduction
Clearly, culture matters in both business practices and
academic research. Indeed a Google search for "culture"
provides more than half a billion hits, and major social
science electronic databases provide links to 100,000 to
700,000 articles when "culture" is used as the search key
word (Taras, Rowney, & Steel, 2009, p. 357). Furthermore, a
recent search by this author of published studies based on
Scandinavian culture alone during the last decade shows
more than 100 papers with culture as an independent variable
(please see appendix). Indeed, academic studies published in
the last two decades have indicated some distinctive aspects
of Scandinavian management. Smith, Andersen, Ekelund,
Gravesen, and Ropo's (2003) seminal paper, "In search of
Nordic management styles," offers a valuable contribution to
this field. Nevertheless, little has been published in the last
decade to update these findings or to highlight the unique
element of each individual Nordic society. Hence, the debate
of how culture matters is ongoing. Consequently, this article
will compare the findings from the GLOBE study of societal
cultural practices from the Danish and Swedish data, to the
Norwegian data from the author's doctoral research, to
understand any such cultural differences in Scandinavia.
The methodology and quantitative instrument applied in
this present study of Scandinavian societal culture is based
on Project GLOBE's (Global Leadership and Organizational
Behaviour Effectiveness) study (House, Javidan, Dorfman,
& Gupta, 2004). This ongoing research is a multiphase,
multimethod project examining the interrelationships
between societal culture, organizational culture, and leader-
ship. A total of 170 social scientists and management schol-
ars from 62 cultures representing all major regions of the
world are engaged in this long-term programmatic series of
intercultural studies. Approximately 17,300 middle manag-
ers from 950 organizations took part in the original study by
House et al. (2004), and 710 middle managers took part in
this researcher's doctorate study of Norwegian societal cul-
tural practices. The meta-goal of GLOBE is to develop
empirically based theories to describe, understand, and pre-
dict the impact of specific cultural variables on leadership
and organizational process and to determine their effective-
ness. More detailed information can be found on GLOBE's
website at http://mgmt3.ucalgary.ca/web/globe.nsf/index.
Intercultural research supports the belief that to be able to
understand cultural and communication values, business
people first need to be open and aware of their own values
and then be able to compare their own cultural norms with
those of their business partners. In terms of societies in the
Nordic region, if business people appreciate how their
behavior is perceived by others and how they can expect the
other party will act, cultural clashes that could otherwise

Culture Matters: Norwegian Cultural
Identity Within a Scandinavian Context
Gillian Warner-Søderholm1
Abstract
Whether managers are concerned with financial issues, marketing, or human resource management (HRM), cultural values
and practices do matter.The purpose of this article is to understand Norwegian managers' cultural values within the cross-
cultural landscape of her neighbors in the "Scandinavian cluster." Clearly, subtle but disturbing differences may surface even
when representatives from similar cultures work together.As a follow on from the GLOBE project,data based on the GLOBE
instrument were collected on culture and communication values in Norway from 710 Norwegian middle managers for this
present study.Although the Scandinavian cultures appear ostensibly similar,the results illustrate that research can reveal subtle
but important cultural differences in nations that are similar yet dissimilar.All three Scandinavian societies appear intrinsically
egalitarian; they appear to value low Power Distance, directness, and consensus in decision making and to promote Gender
Egalitarianism. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in the degrees of commitment to these values by each individual
Scandinavian partner.These differences need to be understood and appreciated to avoid misunderstandings.

threaten the business relationship can be avoided (Warner-
Søderholm, 2010b).
Participants in the Norwegian study unanimously saw
societal culture and behavior in business in Scandinavia as
regionally different (Warner-Søderholm, 2010a). Figure 1
below summarizes the findings of this "Scandinavian cluster
study" from this researcher's doctoral research. The follow-
ing section then discusses the GLOBE dimensions of
Uncertainty Avoidance, Collectivism, Assertiveness,
Performance Orientation, Humane Orientation, Power
Distance, Gender Egalitarianism, and Future Orientation, in
a Norwegian context within a Scandinavian framework.
Project GLOBE's Performance Orientation
Within a Scandinavian Context
Performance Orientation is an important cultural dimension
that has not been sufficiently examined in past theoretical or
empirical cultural research (House et al., 2004). The few
researcherssuchasParsonsandShils(1952)andTrompenaars
(1993) who have discussed elements of Performance
Orientation have explored this in relation to other society
values such as how status is accorded. Project GLOBE pres-
ents Performance Orientation as the degree to which an
organization or society encourages and rewards group mem-
bers for performance improvement and excellence (House et
al., 2004). Kahn (1979) and Hofstede and Bond (1988) argue
that performance values are not limited to regions with
Protestant beliefs. They posit that Confucian principles of
perseverance, working hard, and learning new skills mirror
performance, thus proposing that Confucius teachings and
Weber's emphasis on hard work reach similar conclusions:
that cultural values of performance exist more strongly
among some cultural and regional groups than others
(Hofstede & Bond, 1988).
High-scoring cultures tend to focus on achievement, the
future, taking initiative, and job-related accomplishments.
Low-scoring countries, however, tend to focus on tradition,
family, affiliation, and social ties. Hence, social relationships
are valued more than achieving. Additional predictors of
Performance Orientation were found to be related to a coun-
try's level of economic prosperity, higher levels of human
development, and a stronger social support for competitive-
ness (House et al., 2004). Data gathered from the IMD's
Global Competitiveness Ranking (1998), the United Nation's
Human Development Report (1998), and The World Values
Survey (Inglehart, 1997) supported these hypothesized cor-
relations. Table 9 offers a summary of economic indicators
related to the intercultural focus of this study.
As can be seen in Table 1, Performance Orientation eval-
uates the extent to which a community encourages and
rewards setting challenging goals, striving for innovation,
and performance improvement versus valuing family rela-
tions, traditions, sensitivity, and experience. Norway, along
with all her Scandinavian partners are categorized within
band "B" of the GLOBE scores (moderate to high
Performance Orientation), with scores as follows: highest in
Denmark (4.22), followed by Norway (4.18) and Sweden
(3.72).
Project GLOBE's Future Orientation
Within a Scandinavian Context
Future Orientation is the degree to which individuals in
organizations or societies engage in future-oriented behav-
iors such as planning, investing in the future, and delaying
individual or collective gratification (House et al., 2004).
With regard to the economic and social predictors of this
dimension, project GLOBE applied relevant data from the
IMD Global Competitiveness Ranking (1994), the World
Economic Forum's Competitiveness Ranking (1998), the
United Nation's Human Development Report (1998), and

the World Values Survey (Inglehart, 1997). This data show
the following factors as predictors of high levels of Future
Orientation: economic prosperity, high levels of society
health, active political ideology, and positive attitudes
toward gender issues. Norway, along with Denmark, is
placed in band "A" and ranks highest of all the Scandinavian
countries in this study, while Sweden is placed in band B
(moderately high). The mean scores for Future Orientation
in the Scandinavian cluster are for Norway: 4.48, followed
by Denmark: 4.44 and Sweden: 4.39
These results correlate with Hofstede and Bond's study of
long-term orientation (Hofstede & Bond, 1988). Government
planning, tax contributions, public investment, and a com-
mitment to a strong welfare state are elements of all the
Scandinavian nations' long-term approach to planning for a
stable future. Table 2 offers a summary of the key elements
recognized in the Future Orientation dimension.
Project GLOBE's Gender Egalitarianism
Within a Scandinavian Context
One of the most fundamental ways in which societies differ
is the extent to which each prescribes and proscribes differ-
ent roles for women and men (Hofstede, 2001). Some societ-
ies are more gender egalitarian and seek to minimize gender
role differences (House et al., 2004). Researchers of this
dimension support these claims (Barry, Bacon, & Child,
1957/1967; Coltrane, 1996; Williams & Best, 1982). Gender
Egalitarianism is defined as the degree to which an organiza-
tion or society minimizes gender role differences while
promoting gender equality. Predictors of gender egalitarian
values include national wealth per capita (Hofstede, 2001).
The figures in Table 9 summarize GDP, with Norway's fig-
ures indicating a stable national wealth and a variation from
her main trading nations. Schwartz (1994) posits a positive
correlation between levels of mastery or self-assertiveness in
society and lower levels of Gender Egalitarianism. Coltrane
(1996) claims that an important predictor of strong Gender
Egalitarianism is the degree of men's parental investment.
He claims that a greater investment in child rearing by men
in society exposes children to nontraditional parent roles,
which then encourages their efforts in balancing gender
roles in society later. Furthermore, this increased parental
investment by men gives women the time to pursue nontra-
ditional careers. Nordic countries have introduced state
incentives and regulations that help fathers to achieve a
work­life balance (Kvande, 2009).
Project GLOBE claims to have discovered meaningful
variances in societal values such as Gender Egalitarianism
as a function of a society's climate. Project GLOBE found a
negative relationship between ambient temperatures and a
society's placement on the Gender Egalitarianism scale. The
lower the average daytime temperature, the more a gender
egalitarian a society will be (House et al., 2004). Hofstede's
masculine/feminine construct research correlates closely to
these findings. Hofstede claims that in less hospitable cli-
mates with stable economies, both men and women must
take part in daily tasks to manage or even ensure survival
(Hofstede, 2001). Scandinavian countries experience harsh
winters with average winter temperatures falling as low as
-20 degrees. Hence Hofstede's research posits that
Scandinavian countries, with harsh climates, value high lev-
els of Gender Egalitarianism.
The findings of the GLOBE study of societies correlate
closely to Hofstede's masculinity index, with Norway's
score of 4.03 placing her in the top band A, with Denmark's
score of 3.93 and Sweden's score of 3.38 placing them also
in band A.
A strong correlation is also posited to be that of GNP per
capita and societal values such as Gender Egalitarianism.
Norway's post­World War II regional development policy
has encouraged industry and work opportunities in all
regions of Norway. Table 3 summarizes the key elements of
Gender Egalitarianism.
Project GLOBE's Assertiveness
Within a Scandinavian Context
The concept of Assertiveness originates in part from
Hofstede's cultural dimension of masculinity versus femi-
ninity (House et al., 2004). In masculine societies, men are
supposed to be assertive and tough and women are expected
to be modest and tender (House et al., 2004). Kluckhohn and
Strodtbeck (1961) discussed dominance as an element of

Assertiveness in relation to the nature of the relationship of
individuals, groups, and societies with the outside world. In
line with Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961), Trompenaars
and Hampden-Turner (1998) researched societies' orienta-
tion to nature. They posit that certain cultural groups believe
that they can and should control or dominate nature
(Trompenaars & Hampden-Turner, 1998). Hence, assertive
societies will thus view relations in terms of dominance.
All elements of previous research into cultural Asser-
tiveness share a common understanding that Assertiveness is
the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies
are assertive, confrontational, and aggressive in social rela-
tionships (House et al., 2004). Foreigners often regard
Norwegians and indeed all Scandinavian societies as some-
what reserved and "cold-hearted" due to the fact that many
Scandinavians are nondominant and do not reveal their emo-
tions openly. This way of showing feelings is very culture
specific. A Scandinavian person's insular approach does not
mean that individuals do not feel emotions: It is an indication
of the sense of order and of keeping control in an interdepen-
dent society such as Norway. In Scandinavia, it is rare to
have a heated argument or strong disagreement at work or in
private life. In traffic, it is unusual to blow your horn or to
push into a queue. A sense of order and fairness is prevalent
from the time one starts in nursery schools and learns to take
turns to the custom of patiently waiting in line in the com-
pany canteen. Country mean scores for Norway and her
Scandinavian partners are as follows: Denmark showing
slightly higher scores of 3.80, placing them in band B, and
Sweden and Norway showing slightly lower scores of 3.38
and 3.37, placing them in band C, indicating moderate to low
levels of Assertiveness in comparison. Table 4 summarizes
key elements of Assertiveness.
Project GLOBE's Collectivism
Within a Scandinavian Context
Across all disciplines researched, the importance of the indi-
vidual versus the importance of the group has been studied.
Hofstede (2001) posits a correlation between individualism
and wealth, with industrialized countries such as England,
the United States, and Australia as the most individualistic
cultures (Hofstede, 2001). He also suggests that an increase
in national wealth in a developing country causes an increase
in individualism (Hofstede, 2001). Levine and Norenzayan
(1999) posit that a more accurate predictor of individualism
is pace of life. They argue that individualistic cultures have
a faster pace of life than collectivist cultures as they focus on
achievement. Triandis (1995) discusses intrinsic family sys-
tems as an antecedent to Collectivist values.
Project GLOBE divided this dimension into two con-
structs at the second stage of their pilot study (House et al.,
2004): Institutional Collectivism and In-Group Collectivism.
Institutional Collectivism (Collectivism 1) is the degree to
which organizational and societal institutional practices
encourage and reward collective distribution of resources and
collective action (House et al., 2004). In-Group Collectivism
(Collectivism 2), however, is defined as the degree to which
individuals express pride, loyalty, and cohesiveness in their
organization or families (House et al., 2004). Table 5 offers a
summary of the key traits of these two dimensions of
Collectivism.
To conclude, mean country scores for Institutional
Collectivism practices show rather high levels for all
Scandinavian nations: Sweden: 5.22 (band A), Denmark:
4.80 (band A), and Norway: 4.07 (band B). An interesting
reflectionfromLindellandSigfrids(2007)isthatInstitutional

Collectivism seems, at least to some extent, to go in waves.
When times are good in society, individuality will be stron-
ger, and in bad times Collectivism is stronger.
A specific anomaly in Norway's In-Group Collective cul-
ture lies in the Norwegian tradition for expecting the state to
take care of old people and the sick rather than expecting the
family to take this collective responsibility. A culture that
scores high on In-Group Collectivism is traditionally a culture
that values a home where many generations live together and
where the family collectively assumes responsibility for the
elderly or infirm within the home and where young people at
work and university traditionally stay at home until they start
their own family. In Norway, the high taxation system sup-
ports a comprehensive welfare state that in turn provides for
state care of the elderly or sick--Thus, the collective responsi-
bility is not to provide a home for all generations but to con-
tribute to the welfare state via paying one's taxes. It is not
therefore the norm to take care of elderly parents personally.
The state pension scheme alleviates the financial responsibil-
ity of taking care of the elderly. To sum up, mean In-Group
Collectivism scores for Norway and her Scandinavian part-
ners are as follows: Norway: 5.34 (band B), Sweden: 3.66,
Denmark: 3.53 (both in band C).
Project GLOBE's Power Distance
Within a Scandinavian Framework
Power Distance is defined as the degree to which members
of an organization or society expect and agree that power
should be stratified and concentrated at higher levels of an
organization or government (House et al., 2004). McClelland
(1961) and McClelland and Burnham (1976) determined
that effective managers were characterized primarily by
their need for power. Bass (1985) posits that charismatic
attributes and behaviors play an important role in Power
Distance. Haire, Ghiselli, and Porter (1966) explored the
differences in preferences for power among different cul-
tures. Hofstede (2001) posits that the three most significant
predictors of relative position on the Power Distance con-
tinuum are (a) latitude--distance from the equator, (b) popu-
lation size, and (c) wealth--GNP per capita. Geographical
latitude in a region predicts the variance in Power Distance,
with a decrease in Power Distance as distance from the
equator increases.
As population increases, its members accept a political
power that is more distant and less accessible than smaller
societies. In terms of the third predictor of Power Distance,
namely, wealth per capita, this relationship is explained by
Hofstede as the fact that societal wealth is directly correlated
to the growth of the middle class, which can act as a bridge
between the powerless and the powerful.As presented above,
Norway's post­World War II regional development policy
has encouraged industry and work opportunities in all
regions in Norway.
Norway's mean score of 4.13 in the Power Distance
dimension depicts Norway as a low Power Distance society,
in keeping with her Scandinavian profile. Such low Power
Distance values in Scandinavia are manifested in certain
aspects of Norwegian business practices such as little use of
formal titles, dress codes, and attitudes to practical tasks in
the workplace. Most organizations do not adhere to strict
dress codes to show status. Even in institutions such as par-
liamentary offices and legal institutions, a senior member
may be dressed as informally as a junior staff member. Titles
or last names are rarely used when addressing others, even if
they are of senior rank.Another element of Power Distance--
the roles and hierarchy within a society--is mirrored in the
egalitarian practices at work. In company canteens, for
example, all staff, whether directors or junior staff, pick up
their food themselves in the staff canteen in an orderly man-
ner and dispose of uneaten food and used plates. Canteens
are almost never segregated on a basis of position.
As a society that expects and agrees that power should be
equally shared, the Norwegian progressive and comprehen-
sive tax system, the high union membership, and the gener-
ous welfare state exemplify systems that are in place to
protect and promote egalitarian values. Holmberg and
Åkerblom (2007) discuss elements of low Power Distance
seen outside the workplace in Sweden. These cultural ele-
ments can be seen to be equally pertinent to the discussion of
Power Distance within a Norwegian context. Burial grounds
for instance, are generally similar for everyone, regardless of
family wealth or social status. Nor is the ability to get on a
bus or any other public transportation helped by personal sta-
tus as such: Everybody is obliged to queue (Holmberg &
Åkerblom, 2007). Thus, egalitarian values are promoted on a
national and company level.
To sum up, the mean scores in Power Distance for the
countries in this study are as follows: Denmark: 3.89 (band
"D," low), Norway: 4.13 (band D, low), and Sweden:v 4.85
(band B, moderate). Indeed, these results support the find-
ings from Lindell and Arvonen (1996) that a dominant

feature of the Scandinavian management style is delegation
of responsibility. Table 6 offers a summary of Power
Distance.
Project GLOBE's Humane Orientation
Within a Scandinavian Framework
The concept of "urban helpfulness" is an important concept
in relation to this cultural dimension. Project GLOBE claims
that there is a correlation between decreasing unhelpfulness
and urbanization with increasing population density (House
et al., 2004). According to Triandis (1995), values of altru-
ism, benevolence, kindness, love, and generosity are salient
motivating factors guiding people's behavior in societies
characterized by a strong Humane Orientation. Rokeach's
Value Theory (1968) and Schwartz' Value Theory (1994)
support this proposition. Schwartz posits that the central
norms of a society can be categorized based on their position
on the bipolar dimensions of Self-Transcendence (including
values of tolerance and protection of others) versus Self-
Enhancement (self-gratification; House et al., 2004). A sup-
porting theory to this is Espen-Anderson's studies of welfare
states and their relationship to Humane Orientation (Espen-
Anderson & Korpi, 1987). The social democratic model of a
welfare state in Scandinavia is claimed to be more humanely
oriented compared with the liberal model exemplified in
England and the United States. The social democratic model
in Scandinavia recognizes the personal rights of all individu-
als as an element of universal welfare rights, whereas the
liberal model found in England and the United States offers
welfare state on a proportionally means-tested basis (House
et al., 2004). Table 7 below offers an overview of the main
traits of this dimension.
The scores in Humane Orientation for the countries in this
study are highest for Norway: 4.81 (band A, high), followed
by Denmark: 4.44 (band B, moderate to high) and Sweden:
4.10 (band C, moderate to low). The social concern that is
characteristic of Norway is captured in part by this dimen-
sion, where Norway scores rather highly. At a regional level,
historically, as a predominately agricultural and fishing
nation, local communities living in harsh climates have tra-
ditionally helped each other in times of need. Even today, the
philosophy of "civic duty" and taking part in a dugnad (vol-
untary local help projects) remain a part of daily life in most
regions in Norway, but to a lesser extent in large cities.
Project GLOBE's Uncertainty Avoidance
Within a Scandinavian Context
Uncertainty Avoidance is the extent to which members of an
organization or society strive to avoid uncertainty by relying
on established social norms, rituals, and bureaucratic prac-
tices. People in high Uncertainty Avoidance cultures actively
seek to decrease the probability of unpredictable future
events that could adversely affect the operation of an organi-
zation or society, and remedy the success of such adverse
effects (House et al., 2004). Hofstede (2001) posits that
people in societies create coping mechanisms to handle the
anxiety produced by excessive uncertainty. He notes that
technology has helped us to defend ourselves against uncer-
tainties caused by nature and the law, and against uncertainty
in the behavior of others and religion, and to accept the
uncertainties we cannot defend ourselves against (Hofstede,
2001).
The GLOBE study of Uncertainty Avoidance practices
revealed high correlations between high Uncertainty

Avoidance scores, and high economic prosperity and
extremely supportive governments in terms of economic ini-
tiatives. The Norwegian government has introduced support-
ive initiatives countrywide to support industry and welfare in
all districts, and Norway scored high on Future Orientation.
Table 8 below offers a summary of the key traits associated
with this dimension:
Examples of uncertainty reduction and protection mea-
sures in Norway and also in her Scandinavian neighbors
include the high value placed on the comprehensive welfare
system with generous social security payments for sick
leave, long-term disability, unemployment, and maternity
and paternity pay. A second Norwegian institution that mir-
rors the value placed on Uncertainty Avoidance is the
ombudsman system--a system of checks and balances that
protects individuals against misgovernment in the legal or
public administration systems. Another element of
Norwegian culture that is reflected in the sense of order in
society is people's approach to time. The social norm is to
always be "on time" for both business meetings and social
gatherings. Agendas are frequently distributed in business
meetings and social club meetings, and even for birthdays,
weddings, and christenings, to ensure a sense of order. In this
way, good time keeping and the ethos of sticking to agreed
times is important in the maintenance of good social rela-
tions, both in working and private life in Norway. The mean
country scores for Uncertainty Avoidance showed a high
level for all Scandinavian countries with Denmark and
Sweden falling into band A with the following scores:
Denmark: 5.22, Sweden: 5.32. Norway falls into band B
(moderate to high) with 4.31.
Key Economic Data
Table 9 below summarizes key data for the countries in this
study in terms of Gross Domestic Product, population den-
sity, Corruption Perception Index, and Global
Competitiveness. The Global Competitiveness Report
(2010), published by the World Economic Forum " assesses
the ability of countries to provide high levels of prosperity
to their citizens, as it measures the set of institutions, poli-
cies and factors that set the sustainable current and medium-
term levels of prosperity"(World Economic Forum, 2010).
Summary of Findings on
Scandinavian Cultural Practices
To summarize, although the Scandinavian cultures studied
in this intercultural research appear ostensibly similar, the
results illustrate Ashkansy's (1997) point, that such research
can reveal subtle but important cultural differences in
nations that are similar yet dissimilar. All three societies
appear intrinsically egalitarian, they appear to value low
Power Distance, directness, and consensus in decision mak-
ing and to promote Gender Egalitarianism. Nevertheless,
there are significant differences in the degrees of commit-
ment to these values by each individual Scandinavian part-
ner. These differences need to be understood and appreciated
to avoid misunderstandings. The hallmark of Norwegian
cultural practices within a Scandinavian context was seen to
be higher Gender Egalitarianism. The most pronounced
Norwegian cultural values within a Nordic framework were
also lower Power Distance and higher Humane Orientation
values.
Conclusion
The purpose of this article was twofold: first, to map con-
temporary Norwegian cultural practices within a
Scandinavian context in relation to the author's recent doc-
toral research and project GLOBE findings (House et al.,
2004), and second, to briefly introduce the argument that
culture matters in Scandinavian academic research, by offer-
ing a summary of published research in the last decade
where culture has been a variable. A future direction for
research could be a more in-depth meta-analysis of such
studies.
There is no shortage of advice available to managers
about how to succeed with a new project in a culturally dif-
ferent region. Unfortunately much of this can be superficial
as it only focuses on the practical elements of etiquette, such
as "speak in a low voice in Asia and avoid eye contact with
females in Japan." On the other end of the scale, we might be
given only general advice such as "always be ethical." What
is important to bear in mind here, however, is that what
might be seen as ethical business behavior in one country
may not be the same in another (Warner-Søderholm, 2010a).

As discussed earlier in this paper, culture matters. Subtle
but disturbing differences may surface when representatives
from neighboring regions in Scandinavia work together. As
depicted in the literature review of Scandinavian cultural
research during the last decade (appendix), culture impacts a
wide range of business issues from investment activities,
environmental commitment, social responsibility, manage-
ment practices, and dealing with crises to employee rela-
tions. Management practices in Norway differ in subtle ways
from those of her Scandinavian counterparts because
Norwegians tend to place greater value on directness, stron-
ger Gender Egalitarianism values, and a greater tolerance for
uncertainty. Furthermore, Norway's higher scores in Humane
Orientation and In-Group Collectivist scores indicate a
stronger focus on a more paternal, inclusive style of
management in Norway. While these differences are not
major, their combined effects may have consequences in cer-
tain situations. If a manager from Sweden operates in a more
hierarchical, assertive manner in Norway, this could have a
negative impact on the outcome of the negotiation.
Furthermore, a statement could be made by a Danish consul-
tant such as, "I'm afraid that we believe that the company
should consider cutbacks." The manager from Norway might
have phrased this message as, "You, you have make cut-
backs!" Knowledge about such specific cultural characteris-
tics can help team members from different regions value and
anticipate differences. Potential problems such as interper-
sonal conflict that leads to stress and unnecessary personal
strain and potential loss of revenues can then be minimized.
Clearly, culture does matter.
