DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 24, NUMBER 2, FEBRUARY 2001 257
The loss of productivity caused by illness
has been a prominent topic in general
health policy for several decades (1­3).
Nationwide estimates have also been con-
ducted for people with diabetes (4,5). The
American Diabetes Association estimates that
diabetes accounted for $27 billion in direct
medical costs and $32 billion in indirect or
lost-productivity costs in 1997 (4). In recent
years, there has been a growing recognition
that, for many reasons, the costs of diabetes
should be expressed as an "excess cost" fig-
ure; this excess cost statistic has been esti-
mated in the U.S. for people with diabetes
for direct medical expenditures (6­8), and it
has been estimated for both direct and lost-
productivity costs in Sweden (9).
To date, in these studies, diabetes-
related lost-productivity costs have been
expressed for entire groups and have been
categorized for only a few selected popula-
tion characteristics, such as age. We know
very little about the determinants of pro-
ductivity losses. It is very important to gain
an understanding of what factors affect
them, as well as of their overall magnitude.
We have conducted an analysis of lost
productivity attributable to the prevalence
and severity of diabetes in the U.S. Using
data from the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) and its diabetes supplement,
we developed estimates of how the onset
and progression of diabetes influences the
workplace behavior of individuals. We
focused on two components: participation
in the labor force and actual hours of work.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data were used from the
1989 NHIS, which included a diabetes
supplement, published by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
National Center for Health Statistics. The
NHIS is a personal-interview household
survey of a nationwide sample of the civil-
ian noninstitutionalized population of the
U.S. It contains questions on personal and
demographic characteristics, illnesses,
injuries, impairment, chronic conditions,
and use of health resources. The diabetes
supplement includes extensive survey
questions on the prevalence of diabetes
and specific diabetes complications. Sub-
jects of this study were individuals aged
between 18 and 65 years, both with and
without diabetes, and included those who
were and were not in the labor force.
Employment status
To address the effect of diabetes on the
employment status of an individual, we
adopted the standard probit estimation in
analyzing an individual's probability of being
in the labor force, applied to the entire work-
ing-age population. The dependent variable
takes the value of zero or one, with the lat-
ter meaning "in the labor force." According
to the standard theory of labor supply
(10­17), the decision to be in the labor force
is determined by sex, age, race, marital sta-
tus, educational level, regional factors, fam-
ily size, and the health status of the
individual. Regional factors were approxi-
mated by residence in an urban area and the
region of residence. A self-reported health
status measure was also included. Finally, a
dummy variable indicating whether an indi-
vidual has diabetes was included.
Given that diabetes is a lifelong disease
and that one's health deteriorates as he/she

Productivity Losses Associated With
Diabetes in the U.S.
O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E
OBJECTIVE -- The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of productivity losses in
the U.S. attributable to diabetes, with regard to specific demographic and disease-related char-
acteristics in the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We used the 1989 National Health Inter-
view Survey, a random survey of individuals in the U.S. that included a diabetes supplement.
Data on individuals were obtained for labor force participation, hours of work, demographic
and occupational characteristics, self-reported health status, and several variables that indicated
the presence, duration, and severity (complications) of diabetes. Using multivariate regression
analyses, we estimated the association of independent variables (e.g., demographics, health,
and diabetes status) with labor force participation, hours of work lost, and the economic value
of lost work attributable to diabetes and its complications and duration.
RESULTS -- In general, the presence of diabetes and complications were found to be
related to workforce participation variables. The magnitude of the lost-productivity costs
depended on personal characteristics and on the presence and status of diabetes. In general,
the loss of yearly earnings amounted to about a one-third reduction in earnings and ranged
from $3,700 to $8,700 per annum.
CONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes has a considerable net effect on earnings, and the complica-
tions and duration of diabetes have compound effects. Our findings have implications for the
cost-effectiveness of diabetes control; the presence of complicating factors is the single most
important predictive factor in lost productivity costs attributable to diabetes, and thus the
avoidance or retardation of complications will have an impact on indirect health-related costs.

Productivity losses associated with diabetes
ages, the severity of the disease has an
impact on the likelihood of one being in the
labor force. To address this issue, the above
probit equation was modified and reesti-
mated for the diabetic group only. This was
done by replacing the variable that indicates
the presence or absence of diabetes with
one that indicates whether the individual
had any complications of diabetes, defined
as the reporting of any of the following con-
ditions: affected retina, high blood pressure
or hypertension, angina, stroke, heart dis-
ease, cataracts, kidney disease, foot/ankle
sores (peripheral vascular disease), retinopa-
thy, glaucoma, proteinuria, gum disease,
autonomic neuropathy (bladder control),
amputations, and peripheral neuropathy.
The literature has generally regarded
the impact of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes
on indirect costs as being different. This
may be true because of the clinical and
demographic differences between the two
conditions (e.g., earlier age of onset, longer
duration of diabetes, required use of
insulin, and risk of hypoglycemia). Accord-
ingly, a dummy variable (TYPE1) indicating
whether an individual has type 1 diabetes
or not was included in the regression analy-
sis to test the hypothesis that productivity
losses differ between type 1 and type 2
diabetes. Type 1 diabetes was indicated by
age at onset 30 years, use of insulin, and
body weight (18).
Loss of productivity
The second target variable was work-loss
days for diabetic and nondiabetic groups
who were employed. The loss of produc-
tivity was hypothesized to be affected by
sex, age, race, marital status, educational
level, a self-reported health status measure
and, finally, the occupation of the individ-
ual (19­23). According to the information
provided by the NHIS, occupations were
grouped into 13 categories. To examine the
influence of the occupational effect on the
productivity loss, the 13 categories were
further grouped into 5 broad categories.
Farming, forestry, and fishing occupations
were used as the reference group. Because
the work-loss days for the previous 2 weeks
(the dependent variable) is left censored
with a value of zero, we used a tobit regres-
sion technique (24­26).
To test for the severity of diabetes dis-
ease affecting one's productivity in the
workplace, "the presence of diabetes" in the
above-specified tobit equation was replaced
by "the presence of diabetes with compli-
cations." Similar to the employment status
issue, the differentiation between types 1
and 2 diabetes was taken into account by
having the dummy variable TYPE1
included in the regression.
To derive the productivity loss associ-
ated with diabetes, we first derive the daily
earnings for full-time full-year workers,
disaggregated by race, sex, and age-group.
Based on the Statistical Abstract of the U.S.
(27), average yearly earnings for white
males, white females, black males, and
black females by three age-groups (age
25, 25­54, and 55 years) can be used
to calculate the daily earnings with the
assumption that full-time full-year workers
are employed 5 days per week, 52 weeks
per year. The estimated number of work-
loss days for the past 2 weeks (i.e., the esti-
mated coefficient) is then multiplied by the
derived daily earnings. This amount of pro-
ductivity loss is then projected back to
yearly estimates. All prices were expressed
in 1989 dollars.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics
In total, there were 84,572 individuals in the
NHIS, 71,325 of which were between the
ages of 18 and 65 years. There were 2,405
people (2.8% of the total sample) with dia-
betes, and of these there were 1,401 (2%) in
the relevant age range. For the purpose of
regression analysis, the value of variables
can be neither missing nor in an irrelevant
range. The construction of the working-age
sample therefore has to exclude subjects
with missing values on key variables. With
these deletions, a total sample of 68,634
individuals remained; 1,351 (2%) were peo-
ple with diabetes, and within the diabetes
group, 715 (53%) of these were in the labor
force. We used Student's t test on the sample
statistics for the selected 1,351 subjects and
those statistics from the original sample with
subjects containing missing values for key
explanatory variables. Student'st test showed
that we could not reject the null hypothesis
that there was statistically no difference
between samples. Therefore, the exclusion
of subjects with missing information on cer-
tain variables would not introduce a major
bias in the results.
In Table 1 we present the relevant char-
acteristics for the full sample (working and
nonworking) and the working sample. For
the full sample, people with diabetes were
older, more likely to be black, and less

likely to be single. As expected, only 53%
of people with diabetes were in the labor
force, compared with 77% of those people
without diabetes. With respect to self-
reported quality-of-life by group, 20% of
the individuals with diabetes were in poor
health, whereas 2% of the nondiabetic
group ranked themselves as being in poor
health. For the working sample, except for
sex, age, and health status, the demo-
graphic characteristics by group was very
similar to those of the full sample. We
found that 19% of people with diabetes
were type 1, whereas 80% of them had
diabetes complications.
Employment status
In Table 2 we provide the estimates of the
probability of working. In column 1 we
show the results of the regression equation
for the full sample when using the dummy
variable that indicated the presence or
absence of diabetes. Employment was asso-
ciated with sex (male subjects had 21%
higher employment rates [95% CI
21­22%]), education (better-educated sub-
jects had 3­4% higher rates [2­5%]), and
race (nonwhites had 2­6% lower rates
[2­7%]). Age, marital status (single), and
family size were associated with lower
employment rates. Individuals with poor
health were 45% (43­46%) less likely to be
in the labor force and individuals with fair
health were 20% (19­21%) less likely,
compared with individuals with excellent
health. Individuals with diabetes were 4%
(2­4%) less likely to be in the workforce,
whereas the employment probability differs
between types 1 and 2 diabetes.
In column 2 of Table 2, we present the
estimates for the inclusion of the dichoto-
mous variable indicating whether people
with diabetes had any complications, using
only the sample for people with diabetes.
Unlike in the full sample, only sex, age, and
educational effects are found to be impor-
tant factors determining the workforce
decision. People with diabetes who had
complications were 12% (5­19%) less
likely to be in the workforce than those
who did not have complications. Again, the
dependency on insulin did not enhance the
working probability of people with dia-
betes.
Lost work days
In Table 3 we present the results of regres-
sion equations indicating the effect on
work-loss days of variables including hav-
ing diabetes during the prior 2 weeks and
the severity of diabetes (results are in
columns 1 and 2, respectively). In column
1, we present estimates for the sample of
working individuals. We found that being
male and older reduced the number of
work-loss days. For the self-reported health
status measure, there was a progressive
increase in work-loss days as health status
fell. No statistically significant effect was
found for self-reported diabetes. In column
2 we address the loss of productivity for
people in the diabetes group. Using this
regression equation, the effect of having
diabetes complications (compared with not
having them) increased the number of
work-loss days by 3.2 days (1­6) within a
2-week period. In either specification, the
effect of having type 1 diabetes is found to
be significant.
Because the presence of diabetes was
not statistically significant in the full sample
for the tobit regression (Table 3), in Table 4
we present lost-productivity cost estimates
in relation to the diabetes group with com-
plications. Our reference value for yearly
earnings are shown in column 1. For exam-
ple, a fully employed white male subject
aged 25 years earned $14,339 annually
in 1989. For white men with diabetes with
complications who were aged between 25
and 54 years, the yearly earnings loss was
be $8,616 (column 2). For each demo-
graphic group (by race and sex), such
losses increase with age and peak at the
prime age-group (age 25­54 years). Among
the groups, nonwhite female subjects gen-
erally suffered the least compared with
either their white female or male (white
and nonwhite) counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes has a
considerable impact on economic behavior
in the labor force. Controlling for variables
such as age, sex, and health status, the pres-
ence of diabetes itself reduced employment
by 3.5%, and the presence of complica-
tions reduced employment by 12% com-
pared with the absence of complications.
For those individuals who were employed,
having diabetes did not have a significant
overall effect on hours worked; however,
those who had complicated diabetes
worked 3.2 days less every 2 weeks than
those whose diabetes were without compli-
cations. The type of diabetes had no impact.

people with diabetes. Kahn's results relating
to employment indicated that people with-
out diabetes had participation rates 12%
above those with diabetes, but he only
examined the 50- to 60-year age-group. In
addition, Kahn's results indicated that peo-
ple with 5 years' duration of diabetes had
3% lower employment rates. In his study,
Kahn focused on the issue of changes in
labor markets over time, rather than on the
productivity losses associated with dia-
betes. He did not include the complications
variable, which has important implications
for economic evaluations. He also did not
include an analysis of days of work lost. In
his analysis of the HRS sample, he found
that the earnings of men with diabetes was
69% of those without diabetes; there was
no difference between female groups. How-
ever, the HRS analysis was confined to peo-
ple between the ages of 51 and 62 years
(roughly one-half of our sample of people
with diabetes).
It should be noted that the analysis
could not distinguish between long- and
short-term disability and productivity losses
associated with diabetes. This distinction
would be important in identifying lost-work
time attributable to short-term complica-
tions of diabetes (e.g., hyper- or hypogly-
cemia)--which would likely be more
prevalent in type 1 diabetes--from lost pro-
ductivity attributable to longer-term com-
plications, which could occur in both con-
ditions. Given the limitations of the
self-reported data from population surveys,
we were not able to incorporate productiv-
ity losses caused by premature mortality
associated with diabetes.
We should point out that the data that
we have obtained were self-reported, and
such data are often subject to errors related
to recall. However, the variables that we
examined are less likely to be subject to
recall because of the short period of data
collection. There could be errors related to
the misreporting of diabetes because indi-
viduals might not have known they had
diabetes or complications; however, given
the seriousness of the condition, this
should not be a significant problem. Fur-
ther, given the nature of the data from this
cross-sectional survey, the observed rela-
tionships must be viewed as associations
and not necessarily as causal relationships.
In terms of model setup, one may argue
that diabetes complications may be
endogenous instead of exogenous. Facing
the constraint of data availability and the
theme of the study, the endogeneity issue is
beyond the scope of the present analysis.
Costs that can be tied to specific inter-
ventions, such as diabetes control, can yield
very valuable information. Several studies,
in the U.S. (28,29) and the U.K. (30) have
shown that aggressive interventions for dia-
betes can retard the development of com-
plications. Our results indicate that the net
