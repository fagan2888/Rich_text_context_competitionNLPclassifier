To determine longitudinal risk factors for elder abuse and neglect, an established cohort of
community-dwelling older adults (n = 2,812) was linked with elderly protective service
records over a 9-year follow-up period. Protective services saw 184 (6.5%) individuals in the
cohort for any indication, and 47 cohort members were seen for corroborated elder abuse or
neglect for a sampling adjusted 9-year prevalence of 1.6% (95% Cl 1.0%, 2.1%). In pooled
logistic regression, age, race, poverty, functional disability, and cognitive impairment were
identified as risk factors for reported elder mistreatment. Additionally, the onset of new
cognitive impairment was also associated with elder abuse and neglect. Because the
mechanism of elder mistreatment case-finding in this study was a social welfare system
(protective services), the influence of race and poverty as risk factors is likely to be
overestimated due to reporting bias.

In community-based surveys in the United States
and other Western cultures, between 3 and 6% of in-
dividuals over the age of 65 report having experi-
enced elder abuse and/or neglect, usually at the
hands of family members (Ogg & Bennett, 1992; Pille-
mer & Finkelhor, 1988; Podkieks, 1992). Aside from
these self-reported prevalence studies, however,
elder mistreatment remains the form of family vio-
lence about which we know the least. For example,
although specific injuries in children of certain ages
are virtually diagnostic of child abuse, it is not known
if there are pathognomic injuries of elder abuse.
Whereas an extensive literature on risk factors for
child abuse has developed, the risk factor literature
on elder abuse has been conflicting and inconsis-

tent. Some of these inconsistencies may in part be
due to methodology, arising from the retrospective
nature of previous research (Lachs, Berkman, Fulmer,
& Horwitz, 1994). Besides the recall biases inherent in
retrospective designs, the impact of changing risk
factors is poorly captured in these studies. For exam-
ple, it has been our clinical experience that the mere
presence of cognitive or functional impairment is not
nearly as compelling a risk factor for mistreatment as
the trajectory of the decline -- such as, the acute
worsening of these impairments that can occur after
a prolonged hospitalization.
In this study we report on risk factors for reported
and verified elder abuse and neglect in a cohort of
2,812 community-dwelling older adults followed over
a 9-year period. Cases were identified through a state
social service agency (the ombudsman's protective
services for the elderly program) charged with as-
sessment and advocacy for frail or disenfranchised
elderly persons, a subset of whom have experienced
elder mistreatment. Risk factors for entering this so-
cial welfare system for any reason have been re-
ported previously (Lachs et al., 1994; Lachs, Williams,
O'Brien, Hurst, & Horwitz, 1996).
Methods
The study was conducted by linking an estab-
lished cohort of older adults with records from
Connecticut's Ombudsman on Aging (the state en-
tity responsible for investigating and adjudicating
cases of elder abuse, neglect, self-neglect, exploita-
tion, or abandonment occurring in the community
Vol. 37, No. 4,1997 469
or long-term care facilities). Detailed descriptions of
the cohort and the referral pathway for ombudsman
investigation have been reported previously (Lachs
et al., 1994). Briefly, New Haven, Connecticut, is the
site of a National Institute on Aging EPESE cohort
(Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies
in the Elderly; National Institute on Aging, 1986).
This stratified probability sample of 2,812 adults
over the age of 65 was assembled on the basis of
housing type and sex; nearly one in seven older
adults living in the city in 1981 was enrolled. At co-
hort inception the median age was 75 years; men
were oversampled so that the sample consisted of
1,643 men and 1,169 women from diverse ethnic,
racial, and social backgrounds. In 1982 a detailed
in-person baseline interview was performed cover-
ing several domains including demographics, func-
tional and cognitive status, chronic diseases, self-
perceived health, social networks, leisure activities,
life events, depression, and a number of other areas.
Standardized instruments were used wherever possi-
ble, and periodic inter-rater reliability studies were
conducted among interviewers to ensure data qual-
ity. After the inception interview, cohort members
continue to have annual reinterviews by phone, and
in-person interviews every third year.
Since 1978, the State Ombudsman on Aging has
had responsibility for investigating cases of elder
abuse and neglect in Connecticut. Reports come to
the office from a variety of sources including manda-
tory reporters (health care professionals and para-
professionals whose work puts them in regular con-
tact with older adults), and non-mandatory reporters.
Suspicion alone is grounds for reporting in Con-
necticut. Once a call is received, the ombudsman
must make an on-site visit within 5 days to investi-
gate. This process involves contacting all parties able
to provide information in addition to an interview
with the older adult and, if possible, the alleged per-
petrators of the mistreatment. After completing the
evaluation, the ombudsman deems the cases to be
either substantiated or uncorroborated.
Connecticut Definitions and Major Outcome
of the Study
In Connecticut, elder abuse is defined as the will-
ful infliction of physical pain, injury, or mental an-
guish, or the willful deprivation by a caretaker of
services necessary to maintain physical and mental
health. Neglect is defined as inability by an elderly
person living alone to provide him- or herself the
services necessary to maintain physical and mental
health, or failure by the responsible caretaker to
provide such services. Thus, under Connecticut def-
initions it is possible to be self-neglected. Exploita-
tion is defined as taking advantage of an older adult
for monetary gain or profit.
The major outcome of this study was reported and
corroborated elder abuse and/or neglect, including
exploitation, by a party other than the older adult
occurring at any point during the 9-year follow-up
period. Subjects who were investigated by the om-
budsman for "self-neglect" or who had abuse or
neglect investigations that were not corroborated
were excluded from the analyses (i.e., from both the
mistreated group and the comparison group of co-
hort members not investigated by the ombudsman).
In several cases, cohort members had several om-
budsman investigations over the follow-up period,
sometimes for different allegations; those individu-
als were deemed to have experienced the outcome
of any corroborated allegation in any investigation
included abuse, neglect (exclusive of self-neglect),
or exploitation.
The process whereby cohort members were iden-
tified as ombudsman clients during the follow-up
period has also been described previously. This in-
volved a manual "matching" of state and cohort
records for all ombudsman clients whose demo-
graphic features corresponded to the initial eligibil-
ity criteria of the cohort. Extensive confidentiality
safeguards were devised to protect the identity of
all subjects; the final merged data set contained no
information that would permit the identification of
any individual.
Strategy of Analysis
A crude and sampling-adjusted prevalence was
calculated for reported elder abuse and neglect over
the 9-year follow-up period. Subsequent analyses
compared the prevalence of risk factors in cohort
members who experienced reported elder abuse
and neglect with these risk factors in to those who
did not. These analyses were also weighted for the
sampling mechanism of the cohort. Potential risk fac-
tors were selected on the basis of (a) an extensive
theoretical literature review on the causes of elder
mistreatment (Johnson, 1991), (b) risk factors found
in a review of prior studies (Lachs & Pillemer, 1995),
and (c) the principal investigator's (ML) clinical expe-
rience in this area. Risk factors were broadly classi-
fied into four domains -- sociodemographic, clinical,
physical function, and social network.
We were especially interested in the role of func-
tional and cognitive impairment in the genesis of
elder mistreatment; prior retrospective research has
shown these variables to be inconsistent predictors
of mistreatment. Specifically, we were interested in
looking at functional status as dynamic risk factors
for mistreatment [i.e., the development of new ac-
tivity of daily living (ADD impairment or worsening
cognitive ability rather than considering these vari-
ables cross-sectionally]. The longitudinal nature of
the E
P
E
S
E study permitted such analysis.
Pooled logistic regression analysis was used to ex-
amine the predictors of initial investigation for abuse
or neglect (Cupples, D'Agostino, Anderson, & Kan-
nel, 1988). This method was chosen to allow for up-
dating of the predictor variables, which more fully
utilizes the longitudinal nature of the study. Further,
it permits individuals who are lost from the study
(due to death or nursing home placement) to be in-
cluded until the time they are lost. Because many of
the potential risk factors of interest (e.g., cognitive
status and social networks) were assessed at only the
triennial face-to-face interviews, the 9-year follow-up
470 The Gerontologist
was divided into three 3-year intervals for this analy-
sis. According to this strategy, each of three observa-
tion periods (1982-1985, 1985-1988, and 1988-1991)
was included as a separate record for each subject in
a "pooled sample." For each record, the risk factors
were updated using each subject's status at the be-
ginning of the interval; the outcome for each partici-
pant was whether mistreatment had been investi-
gated and corroborated during that interval. The
number of records each individual contributed to
this pooled sampled depended upon three factors,
which determined when the subject was at risk for
the outcome. First, subjects who had experienced
mistreatment during an interval were coded as
having the outcome during that interval and were
dropped from subsequent intervals. Second, individ-
uals who died during an interval were dropped from
subsequent intervals. Finally, individuals who en-
tered long-term care facilities were dropped from in-
tervals subsequent to their placement, as they were
no longer capable of experiencing the outcome of
interest (i.e., community elder mistreatment). Al-
though the ombudsman in Connecticut has respon-
sibility for the investigation of abuse, neglect, and
quality-of-care issues arising in nursing homes, insti-
tutional abuse was not an outcome of the study.
Only 3% of cohort members interviewed in nursing
homes returned to the community; therefore, we felt
that treating nursing home admission as perma-
nently removing a person from risk of community in-
vestigation should not bias the results. Utilizing this
method, 2,668 individuals in the 2,812-member co-
hort were included in the study; they contributed a
total of 6,222 observations to the pooled sample.
Each potential risk factor was first evaluated in a
pooled model that included only that variable and a
variable indicating the observation interval. It was as-
sumed that the odds ratio associated with a given
risk factor was the same across intervals. This as-
sumption was tested by running another model for
each variable that also included an interaction term
between the risk factor and the interval. An alpha
level of .01 was stipulated as the boundary for signifi-
cant risk factor-by-interval interaction. Next, each risk
factor was included in a model that adjusted for age,
sex, race, and household income as well as the inter-
val. Finally, a model was constructed that included
the sociodemographic features and statistically sig-
nificant risk factors from each domain; here an alpha
level of 0.2 was the criterion for model inclusion.
Data management and preliminary analyses were
conducted using SAS software (SAS Institute, 1989).
All hypothesis testing and multivariate analysis was
conducted using SUDAAN in order to account for
the sampling design (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1995).
Results
Over the 9-year follow-up period, 184 (6.5%) mem-
bers of the cohort were seen by the ombudsman on
267 separate occasions for any indication. Of those
investigations, 81 (30%) were for elder abuse and ne-
glect, and 57 (70%) of the investigations were sub-
stantiated. In all, 47 members of the 2,812 cohort had
experienced the outcome of reported elder abuse
and neglect for a sampling-adjusted 9-year preva-
lence of 1.6% (95% Cl 1.0%, 2.1%); 9 (19%) of these 47
cases were for abuse, 8 (17%) were for exploitation,
and 30 (64%) were for neglect by another party. The
most common perpetrators of mistreatment were
adult children (45%), followed by spouses (26%).
Other perpetrators of mistreatment included grand-
children and paid caregivers.

risk factors for experiencing reported elder abuse
or neglect, or both, at any time during the follow-up
period. Among sociodemographic features, non-
White race, low income, and advanced age at in-
terval inception were significantly associated with
experiencing reported elder abuse and neglect.
With respect to the functional status domain, the
presence of any ADL impairment as well as the
number of ADL impairments at interval inception
were both associated with the outcome. Mistreated
subjects also had nearly twice the prevalence of
higher impairments as measured by standardized
instruments (Nagi, 1976; Rosow & Breslau, 1966)
such as doing housework, climbing stairs, and writ-
ing or handling small objects (p < .01). Similarly,
cognitive impairment as measured by the Mental
Status Questionnaire (MSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975) was asso-
ciated with the outcome, while depressive symp-
tomatology as measured by the Center for Epidemi-
ological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff,
1977) and urinary incontinence at interval inception
were not.
Despite the bivariate association between func-
tional status and the outcome of corroborated elder
mistreatment, the prevalence of chronic disease (as
measured by a standard inventory that included
arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, hip fracture, my-
ocardial infarction, cancer, and stroke), was actually
higher in the non-mistreated group. Finally, for so-
cial network variables, mistreated cohort members
were more likely to be living with someone at inter-
val inception (p < .01), but also have fewer social
ties (p < .005).
Table 2 shows the results of multivariate analysis
after adjusting first only for the interval of observa-
tion, followed by adjustment for demographic fea-
tures and income. The last column shows results
from a single model in which the interval, demo-
graphic features, and income were included as well
as other statistically significant risk factors (p < 0.2)
from each domain. When two parameterizations of
the same risk factor were available (e.g., any ADL
impairment vs number of ADL impairments), the
stronger contributor from the earlier models was
selected. Several variables achieve statistical signifi-
cance in the final model, with each domain having
at least one independently contributing risk factor.
The most robust were non-White race (OR 4.0, 95%
Cl 2.2, 7.2), number of ADL impairments (OR 1.3 per
impairment, 95% Cl 1.0, 1.8), cognitive impairment
defined as four or more errors on the Pfeiffer Men-
tal Status Questionnaire (OR 3.0, 95% Cl 1.1, 7.7),

variate analysis, the number of chronic conditions
showed an inverse association with reported elder
abuse and neglect (OR 0.6, 95% Cl 0.4, 0.8).
Because our clinical experience has been that the
trajectory of functional and cognitive decline has
more of a bearing on mistreatment than "stable"
impairments, we analyzed the impact of developing
new ADL or cognitive impairment over consecutive
intervals (Table 3). In these analyses, change is as-
sessed by comparing ADL and cognitive function
from the start of a given interval to these functions
at the start of a prior interval. The referent group
members are those with no impairment in the prior
interval and no new impairment in the subsequent
interval. Interval one is not included because no
data on prior impairment were available. Those sub-
jects who began a prior interval non-ADL impaired
and then subsequently developed new ADL impair-
ment were at increased risk for reported mistreat-
ment (OR 2.9, 95% Cl 1.0, 8.0), but these associations
became smaller and nonsignificant after adjusting
for demographic and socioeconomic features. On
the other hand, those subjects who began an inter-
val cognitively intact and became subsequently im-
paired were at high risk for the outcome (OR 11.6,
95% Cl 4.1, 33.0), and these differences remained
highly significant after making the same adjust-
ments (OR 5.1, 95% Cl 2.0,12.7).
Discussion
Elder abuse theorists have speculated about the
causes of mistreatment and have tested these hy-
potheses in a variety of risk factor studies, all of
which have been either retrospective or cross-sec-
tional. Not surprisingly, the resulting picture of the
older adult at risk has varied considerably. At first
the "typical" elder abuse victim was reproducibly
frail, female, and cognitively and functionally im-
paired. Subsequent studies found no relationship
between gender, frailty, cognitive and functional
status, and marital status. In pilot work we have ar-
gued that the source of these divergent findings
may be methodologic (Lachs et al., 1994). In this first
prospective, longitudinal study of elder mistreat-
ment based on a large, well characterized commu-
nity-based sample, risk factor data were obtained
repeatedly using standardized instruments. Several
risk factors emerged as potent predictors of re-
ported elder mistreatment including poverty, race,
functional and cognitive impairment, worsening
cognitive impairment, and living with someone.
One limitation of our study is the mechanism of
elder mistreatment case-finding, which is essentially a
social welfare system (adult protective services). This
probably influences the finding of race and poverty
as important risk factors, in all likelihood overestimat-
ing their contribution due to (a) reporting bias and (b)
the potential confounding of poverty and race. The
more developed literature on child abuse has exam-
ined the relationship between sociocultural factors
and child abuse, and these have recently been re-
viewed by Korbin (1995). With respect to reporting
bias, sociodemographic features are believed to influ-
ence physician attribution of child abuse in suspected
cases (O'Toole, Turbett, & Nalepka, 1983). In the hos-
pital setting, for example, almost half of cases meet-
ing criteria for child abuse were not reported to pro-
tective service agencies in one study, and non-White
race was among the factors associated with preferen-
tial reporting (Hampton & Newberger, 1985). Al-
though some studies have shown minority families to
be overrepresented in child abuse protective service
registries (Lauderdale, Valiunas, & Anderson, 1980),
the relative contribution of reporting biases has also
been challenged (Jason, Andereck, Marks, & Tyler,
1982). With respect to the potential confounding
between race and poverty in the study of family vio-
lence, at least one study of child abuse involving fami-
lies receiving Aid to Dependent Families With Chil-
dren (AFDC) found that Black families tended to be
the more materially deprived than White families
participating in the program (Horowitz & Wolock,
1981). This would suggest that in some settings,
poverty is indeed a confounder with respect to race.
Our results also suggest that there is some similar
economic confounding in elder mistreatment, but
poverty and minority status remained significant
when other sociodemographic features were in-
cluded in multivariate models. The degree to which
reporting and ascertainment bias additionally affect
our results is unknown, but clearly a social welfare
system that preferentially enrolls low-income minor-
ity cases will cause an overestimate of the influence
of these features. With respect to other sociodemo-
graphic variables, age was an additional risk factor for
mistreatment in this study, but gender conferred no
additional risk. This is consistent with more recent
case-control studies of elder abuse.
In addition to its influence on sociodemographic
risk factors, reporting bias is probably responsible
for the relatively low prevalence (1.6%) of mistreat-
ment in the cohort in comparison to community-
based prevalence studies that have used self-report

in the most widely quoted study [Pillemer & Finkel-
hor, 1988]). Adult protective service registries prob-
ably detect only a fraction of actual cases, as many
may not be reported to official agencies. The net ef-
fect of this decreased sensitivity is to lower the
power of the study to detect statistically significant
odds ratios given the finite sample site of the co-
hort. However, many odds ratios reached statistical
significance in this research, which is likely to be
the largest cohort study of elder mistreatment of
any conducted in the near future.
Functional status is perhaps the most controversial
of elder abuse risk factors. This study found that the
number of ADL impairments, higher functional im-
pairment, and cognitive impairment were risk factors
for mistreatment. Additionally, the development of
worsening cognitive impairment was an especially
potent predictor. As for the role that functional im-
pairments play in the genesis of mistreatment, some
experts have argued that they are directly causative,
whereas others contend that it permits the perpetua-
tion of abuse as the victimized older adult with func-
tional disability is incapable of defending him- or
herself. Unlike sociodemographic features, we do
not believe reporting bias to substantially influence
these findings; if mistreated subjects exist within the
group of cohort members currently identified as
"non-abused," the effect would be to underestimate
the magnitude of the risk conferred by predictors
such as cognitive impairment.
With respect to social network factors, only living
alone was significantly associated with protecting
older adults from mistreatment. Obviously, to be
abused or neglected requires the presence of a per-
petrator, but some have argued for the isolation
theory of mistreatment, wherein mistreatment is
prompted by a dwindling social network that comes
ultimately to include only the abuser or neglecter.
Our data provide some support for this theory as
the number of social ties (measured by standard-
ized social network instruments) was lower in mis-
treated subjects in bivariate analysis, yet 80% of mis-
treated subjects lived with another party.
We recognize other limitations of our study. First
and foremost, this study considered only character-
istics of the victims of mistreatment and not the
perpetrators. Abuser-specific theories of mistreat-
ment abound, and there are certainly traits of
abusers (e.g., alcohol and substance abuse, prior
history of violence, prior history of family violence)
that should alert clinicians to high-risk situations
beyond the factors already identified. Unfortunately,
we do not have abuser data in the same detail as for
victims of mistreatment. Second, the outcome in
this study included abuse, neglect, and exploitation;
it is conceivable that risk factors might be different
for each and that our study is measuring an "aver-
age" effect. The relatively low event rate prevents
us from looking at these outcomes individually, and
also causes many of the parameter estimates for in-
dividual risk factors to be unstable. We also chose
to exclude cases of "self-neglect" in our study, a
large part of the work of adult protective service
agencies in addition to elder abuse and neglect. We
did this based on our clinical experience with pro-
tective service clients, as we believe self-neglect to
be a distinct entity with a likely different "risk factor
profile" (i.e., a higher prevalence of cognitive and
functional impairment).
In summary, poverty, minority status, functional
disability, and worsening cognitive impairment
were risk factors for reported elder mistreatment in
this 9-year longitudinal study of elder mistreatment,
and the influence of race and poverty were proba-
bly overestimated by reporting bias. Clinicians
should be (Particularly aware of high-risk situations
in which functional and/or cognitive impairment are
present, especially in circumstances where violent
behavior has been known to exist previously.1
