Abstract
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, particularly IGF-I
and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), has been the subject of
much attention because of its role in juvenile growth and
their association with cancers at several sites. However,
epidemiologic studies of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 have had mixed
results and several authors have speculated that quality
control (QC), sample storage history, and other methodologic
concerns could play a role in this heterogeneity. This article
documents the results of storage history and QC efforts for a
study of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in 6,226 serum samples from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III
(NHANES III). The study was carried out on site at
Diagnostic Systems Laboratories in Webster, Texas, using
the IGF-I ELISA (DSL 10-5600) and the IGFBP-3 immunor-
adiometric assay (DSL 6600). A run-in study of assay
performance suggested that plates, days, and weeks signif-
icantly affected the variance of both assays. Analysis of
samples with different storage histories also indicated strong
effects of storage history. Serum samples disbursed to
laboratories for measurement of diverse analytes and then
returned for storage showed reductions in serum IGF-I level
averaging 43% and reductions in IGFBP-3 of 25% compared
with samples shipped immediately to the repository for
long-term storage at À80°C. Therefore, the main study was
carried out using samples that had been shipped directly to
the National Center for Health Statistics/NHANES collection
center for storage. Laboratory analyses of NHANES III and
QC samples were carried out over f10 months. QC was
monitored through repeated testing of blood samples from
six individuals, with two individuals tested twice on each
plate. Assay performance was stable over the entire study
and coefficients of variation averaged 2% to 3% within plates
and f14% for IGF-I and f11.5% for IGFBP-3 over the entire
study. Coefficients of variation varied significantly among
individual QC subjects, ranging from 12.3% to 17.6% for
IGF-I and 8.9% to 12.8% for IGFBP-3. Based on Levy-Jennings
plots, f5% of the plates used for IGF-I in the main study were
out of compliance. Finally, location on a plate had small but
significant effects on IGF-I level. Together, these results
highlight the need for care in large studies of putative
biomarkers for cancer risk and illustrate some probable
sources of heterogeneity in past epidemiologic studies of the
IGF axis and cancer. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev

Introduction
Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) are related to growth and
development and also have metabolic activities including
mitogenic actions regulating cellular proliferation and differ-
entiation (1). Two IGFs (IGF-I and IGF-II) and six specific IGF
binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6) have been identified,
but recent epidemiologic research has focused on IGF-I and its
main binding protein (IGFBP-3; ref. 1). Both basic and
epidemiologic studies of IGFs and risk of cancer have been
motivated by their effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis
and their place in insulin signaling (2). Results from the
epidemiologic studies suggest that high levels of IGF-I are
related to increased risk for colorectal (2-4), prostate (5), and
premenopausal breast cancers (2, 6), although the data are not
always consistent (2, 6). There is also considerable interest in
associations between IGF levels and cancer risk factors (1),
including breast density (7), alcohol consumption (8, 9), diet
(10-12), and other lifestyle factors (10, 11). The IGF system
seems to be related to risk of other diseases, notably ischemic
heart disease (13) and congestive heart failure (14). In these
studies, lower levels of IGF-I have been associated with
increased risk.
Clinical tests for IGFs show that current assays are sufficient
for diagnosing growth-related deficiencies (15). However,
epidemiologic studies examine associations of IGF across the
entire range from low to normal to high values, and therefore
require a higher degree of accuracy and precision in the assay
performance than IGF assays used for clinical purposes. The
success of these epidemiologic studies is dependent on high-
quality, sensitive laboratory assays that can be done on
thousands of samples over weeks or months and proper storage
and sample handling. Some of the variability in results of
studies of cancer and IGFs could be due to variability in assay
performance or because of differences in assays from different
vendors (16). Indeed, concerns have been raised about the
reliability of the current IGF and IGFBP assays (2, 4, 16-19).
In this article, we characterize the long-term performance of
two commonly used assays, one for IGF-I and one for IGFBP-3,
and we report a number of other quality control (QC) results
relevant to large studies of IGFs from stored serum samples.
These studies were carried out as part of a cross-sectional
study of f6,000 samples from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and included
analysis of f700 QC samples. We first describe a run-in study
of the test plates and kits used in our analysis. This study used

samples from the same subjects used for QC in the main study.
The run-in was used to determine coefficients of variation (CV)
between replicate samples from a vial, between vials obtained
from single subjects, among plates, between days, and between
2 weeks. Second, we report the effects of storage history and
sample handling on IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in f100
NHANES III samples that were handled in two different ways
after collection. Lastly, we examine the performance of the two
assays over 6 months during an analysis of the 6,000 samples,
which included f700 control samples obtained from six QC
subjects. This extensive QC data set allowed us to document
individual and temporal variation in assay performance. These
results should be of considerable interest for the design of
future studies of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in large cohorts and
surveys and should aid in the interpretation of past epidemi-
ologic studies of the IGF axis.
Materials and Methods
This study characterizes the performance of the Diagnostic
System Laboratories (DSL) Inc. (Webster, TX) IGF-I ELISA (DSL
10-5600) and IGFBP-3 immunoradiometric assay (IRMA; DSL
6600). The IGF-I ELISA is an enzymatically amplified ``one-
step'' sandwich-type immunoassay. The assay includes a
simple extraction step in which IGF-I is separated from its
binding protein in serum. The IGFBP-3 IRMA is a noncompet-
itive assay in which the analyte to be measured is ``sandwiched''
between two antibodies (20). The first antibody is immobilized
to the inside walls of the tubes and the other antibody is
radiolabeled for detection. The analyte present is bound by both
of the antibodies to form a ``sandwich'' complex.
All assays described were done by a single technician at the
DSL facility in Webster, Texas. For the IGF-I ELISA, a single
batch of reagents sufficient for the entire experiment was frozen
at the study onset. The IGFBP-3 IRMA required fresh batches of
radioactive tracer every 3 weeks; all other reagents were from a
single lot. Throughout the study, we reanalyzed samples if the
CV for replicate samples from a single vial was >15%. This was
rare, as only 10 samples for IGF-I and 2 samples for IGFBP-3 had
CVs >15% between replicates. The 63 out-of-range IGF-I
samples were diluted 50:50 and reanalyzed. Out-of-range
samples had values of IGF-I greater than the highest DSL
laboratory standard included on each plate.
The QC efforts associated with this study had three
components. First, we did a run-in study, which characterized
assay performance using recently collected QC samples. The
QC samples consisted of serum samples from six volunteers
who visited the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine
donor center. Three of the volunteers were men of ages 23, 38,
and 58 years; three were women of ages 31, 37, and 59 years.
Serum was frozen at À80jC 1 to 3 h after collection. After 1 to
3 weeks, the serum from each subject was thawed and
aliquoted into 360 0.5-mL vials and then refrozen at À80jC.
These samples were used in the pilot study and as QC samples
during the analysis of NHANES III subject samples. A factorial
design was used for the run-in study. For each of the six QC
subjects, we analyzed duplicate samples from two different
vials on two plates per day for 3 days in the first week and
2 days in the following week. This resulted in 240 measure-
ments from 120 vials for IGF-I and IGFBP-3.
Following the run-in study, we conducted a site visit to the
DSL facility in Webster. A review of the assays led to two small
tests aimed at determining whether sample dilution or
radioactive tracer age (I-125, half life = 60.1 days) contributed
to variance in the initial test results. Although these factors did
not conclusively seem to influence our results, we chose to
replace the radioactive tracers used for the IRMA every
3 weeks, 1 week earlier than the recommended time limit for
the commercially available kit. We also tested new batches of
radioactive tracer with our QC samples. None of these tests
suggested aberrant assay performance. The run-in study was
analyzed using a general linear model that allowed us to
quantify variance components at the vial, plate, day, and week
levels.
Second, we tested the effects of sample preparation and
storage on 108 NHANES III surplus serum samples; recall that
these samples were collected between 1988 and 1994 (21).
These samples were stored using two different procedures.
Surplus serum samples were frozen on collection, shipped
directly to testing labs, thawed for analysis of various serum
factors, refrozen in À80jC freezers, and made available for
further study. During their time at the testing labs, the surplus
serum samples may have been frozen and thawed one or more
times for reanalysis and experienced variable periods at
refrigerator and room temperature. The exact treatment these
samples received is unknown. A second group of samples, the
liquid nitrogen samples, were frozen on collection, shipped to
Atlanta, defrosted on an ice table, and aliquoted into four
0.5-mL vials. Liquid nitrogen samples were then stored in
liquid nitrogen until released for our study.
Third, in the main study of f6,000 subjects from the fasting
subsample of NHANES III, we analyzed IGF-I and IGFBP-3
using the liquid nitrogen samples. Both the liquid nitrogen
study samples and our QC samples experienced two freeze-
thaw cycles before this study. IGF-I was analyzed on 96-well
plates. Samples for 36 NHANES III subjects and two samples
from each of two of the QC subjects were analyzed in
replicates on each of the plates (72 wells of subject serum,
8 wells of QC serum, and 16 wells of internal standards). QC
subjects were placed on plates at random, but replicate
samples from a single vial were adjacent to one another. We
recorded location of samples on each plate. The same pairs of
QC samples (designated A-F for the six individuals) were used
throughout the study (A and B, C and D, and E and F).
Samples were analyzed for IGFBP-3 in batches of coated
tubes on the same days as the IGF-I samples using the same
scheme of replication for the NHANES samples and QC subjects
(i.e., groups of 36 samples and two samples from each of two QC
subjects were analyzed in replicate). One to four racks and
batches of IGFBP-3 were analyzed on weekdays over the course
of f10 months (June 2004-February 2005). Sample sizes for each
QC subject are not exactly equal because of uneven numbers
of samples in batches of samples shipped to DSL for analysis
and because of erroneous QC sample placement in a small
number of batches that resulted in extra assays of certain pairs
of QC subjects. For example, there were 114 replicates for QC
subjects F and E and 140 replicates for subjects A and B.
Standardized deviates for the QC subjects were computed
from individual values by subtracting the subject's overall
average and dividing by the subject's SD as computed across all
available plates. For IGF-I, the subject-specific means and SDs
were computed from log-transformed values. After analyzing all
samples, we used a modified Levy-Jennings approach to identify
outliers (see below and ref. 22). This approach identified 15
plates for reanalysis. For 12 of these plates, both IGF-I and
IGFBP-3 were reanalyzed. In the remaining three plates, only
IGF-I was reanalyzed because only one IGF-I QC sample was
aberrant (i.e., had a SD >3.0 in absolute value). Plates were
selected for this reanalysis if the average of the two SDs for each
QC subject was >1.96 in absolute value for IGF-I or IGFBP-3.
A new data set was created with 188 plates after the initial
Levy-Jennings analysis and further QC studies were done,
including construction of additional Levy-Jennings plots to
identify plates that were potentially out of compliance. For
these additional Levy-Jennings plots, a plate would be classi-
fied as noncompliant only if the SDs for a given QC subject
were either both below or both above some appropriately
chosen bounds (F c), where c is chosen to give the appropriate
experiment-wise error rate. We wanted to ensure that the

probability (a) of incorrectly classifying one of the 188 plates as
noncompliant was small. Let p denote the probability that both
replicates (denoted r1
and r2
) for a QC subject fall outside the
same (lower or upper) bound strictly by chance:
p ¼ Pr½ðr1
> c and r2
> cÞ or ðr1

< Àc and r2
< ÀcÞ
¼ ½Prðr1
> cÞ2 þ ½Prðr1
< ÀcÞ2
¼ 2½Prðr1
> cÞ2
The last equality follows from the assumed symmetry of the
distributions of SDs, and the next-to-last equality follows from
the assumption that the SDs are statistically independent from
one another. The value of p in the above equation is called the
comparison-wise error rate because it applies only to one plate.
Because we made 188 comparisons per analyte, each with
probability p of indicating noncompliance strictly by chance, we
used a Bonferroni-type adjustment to maintain the so-called
experiment-wise error rate a. To ensure a V 0.05, we set p equal
to 0.05/188 = 2.66 Â 10À4, which implies Pr(r1
> c) is equal to the
square root of 1.33 Â 10À4 (= 0.0115). Finally, we chose c so that
the area under the standard normal curve to the right of c is
0.115 to arrive at c = 2.275. The inner pair of bounds shown on
the Levy-Jennings plots of Fig. 1 corresponds to the aforemen-
tioned choice of c that holds a < 0.05, whereas the outer pair of
bounds correspond to a choice of c = 2.56, which holds a < 0.01.
We illustrate the results of our QC efforts in three ways.
First, we characterize overall levels of variation in the QC
subjects. Second, we graphically illustrate the behavior of
QC samples using Levy-Jennings plots. Third, we report on the
effects of position in a plate on estimated serum levels of IGF-I
using ANOVA.

effect for IGFBP-3 in the run-in study. This was due to a large
difference in average values for IGFBP-3 between weeks 1
and 2 of the run-in. Following a site visit and a change in
reagent replacement schedule (in subsequent analyses, we
replaced the radioactive tracer used in the IGFBP-3 assay every
3 weeks), the between-week effect was no longer present. We
also considered the possibility that sample dilution would
improve assay performance by improving antibody binding
efficiency. We found no evidence for this in comparisons of
analyses with and without a 50% dilution of QC samples
(results not shown).
Effect of Storage Conditions. Following the site visit,
samples subject to two different storage conditions were
analyzed (Fig. 2). Paired t tests indicate significantly lower
values for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in samples sent to laboratories for
the original NHANES III laboratory assays (surplus serum
samples) than those sent directly to Atlanta for storage (liquid
nitrogen samples). The liquid nitrogen samples were frozen,
shipped directly to National Center for Health Statistics
collection center, thawed, aliquoted, and then stored in liquid
nitrogen for 10 to 16 years until the current study. The surplus
serum samples were stored at À80jC but could have experi-
enced multiple freeze-thaw cycles and unknown amounts of
time at refrigerator or room temperature at the laboratories
where the standard NHANES III serum analyses were done.
The mean difference for IGF-I was 129 ng/mL (95% confidence
interval, 105-154; t = 10.47, P < 0.001, n = 96) and for IGFBP-3
was 1,050 ng/mL (95% confidence interval, 841-1,260; t = 9.9,
P < 0.001, n = 102). Compared with the mean IGF-I and IGFBP-3
values in the liquid nitrogen stored specimens, these corre-
spond to 43% and 25% reductions, respectively. Degradation
was not associated with age or race/ethnicity in either analyte,
but degradation of IGFBP-3 was somewhat (P = 0.035) higher in
women (mean difference, 1,257; SE, 142; n = 55) than in men
(mean difference, 813; SE, 152; n = 48). Subsequent analyses
were done entirely on the liquid nitrogen specimens.
Samples included in the 12 plates selected for reanalysis for
both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 indicated that an additional freeze-
thaw cycle did not influence levels of either analyte, confirm-
ing previous studies of these assays (19) and suggesting that
extended time spent at room temperature may be more
important for IGF degradation than an additional freeze thaw
cycle.
Assay Performance. Log transformation resulted in a close
to normal distribution of SDs for IGF-I. Transformation did
not improve the fit of IGFBP-3 SDs. The distributions of SDs
for each analyte had a mean of zero and a variance of 1, and
were fairly symmetrical (Fig. 3). Results for the six QC subjects
throughout the entire 188 plates analyzed during the main
study period are summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in
Fig. 1. Note that these results are based on analyses of means
of two replicates for each QC subjects. Coefficients of variance
between replicate samples from a single vial were very low
[mean CV IGF-I, 2.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.17-2.26;
N = 7,530); mean CV IGFBP-3, 1.91 (95% confidence interval,
1.87-1.95; N = 7,415)]. Average values of these replicates were
used in all subsequent analyses. Variances within subjects
differed significantly (Bartlett's test) for both IGF-I (P < 0.001)
and IGFBP-3 (P < 0.001) in this analysis and CVs ranged from
12.3% to 17.6% for IGF-I and from 8.9% to 12.8% for IGFBP-3
(Table 2). Between-subject effects accounted for 82.7% and
86.2% of variance for IGF-I and IGFBP-3, respectively
(Table 2). We observed significant effects of day (2-4% of total
variance) and plate (f5% of total variance) on assay
performance (Table 1). Thus, samples should be analyzed on
the same plate and on the same day to the extent possible.
Plate effects were somewhat larger than day effects, especially
for IGFBP-3.
We also examined the possibility of variation in IGF-I assay
results based on location on the ELISA plate. We found some
evidence for a location effect. Samples in the outer rows of the
plates had higher levels of IGF-I, adjusted for between-subject
variation (P = 0.0482). However, the magnitude of this effect
was small, as the least square mean IGF-I level in wells in the
outer rows was 246.8 (SE, 1.7) but slightly lower in inner wells
(242.7; SE, 1.13). These estimates were obtained from ANOVA
with QC subject, position, and subject by position as
independent variables and IGF-I level as the dependent
variable.
Discussion
This study characterized the performance of commonly used
assays for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in the context of a large cross-
sectional study of serum samples. Three salient points

emerged from this analysis. First, the performance of the assay
can vary significantly by plate/batch, day, and week of the
assay. Samples must be randomized over the time required for
analysis. Importantly, studies of matched samples should
analyze matches on the same plates. Second, sample degrada-
tion may occur due to handling issues such as freeze-thaw
cycles, time spent at room temperature during sample
aliquoting for other assays, or storage conditions. Careful
efforts to quantify and minimize sample degradation are
required. The present study and other recent studies of
children and adults (e.g., refs. 23, 24) will provide reference
values for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and preliminary measurements
can be used to determine whether sample degradation has
occurred. Third, the DSL ELISA for IGF-I and IRMA for
IGFBP-3 showed good temporal stability. This is important
for large-cohort or surveillance studies that require months for
complete analysis.
CVs for IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were comparable to other recent
studies of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 using DSL kits. For example,
Rinaldi et al. (16) report intrabatch and interbatch CVs of 6.3%
and 8.3% for IGF-I and 7.2% and 13.9% for IGFBP-3 with DSL
ELISAs, and Hankinson et al. (25) report interbatch and
intrabatch CVs of 8.7% and 15.6% for IGF-I and 9.3% and 19.4%
for IGFBP-3, respectively. Variation in IGF-I in this study was a
little higher than past studies but variation in IGFBP-3 was
lower. We cannot determine whether this is due to differences
in sample characteristics or assay performance. Somewhat
lower CVs have been reported in some studies (26); again, it is
difficult to determine whether this was due to assay
performance, laboratory differences, or sample characteristics.
Fewer studies have used the DSL IGFBP-3 IRMA, but one
article reports intra-assay and interassay CVs of 3.9% and
1.9%, respectively (27). Larger studies and those with longer
duration seem to have higher CVs. These relatively high CVs
and evidence for heterogeneity within individuals clearly
suggest that improvements in laboratory practice, careful
sample handling procedures, and improved assays would be
welcome for both analytes. Finally, note that CVs between
replicates within a plate were very low (f2%) for both IGF-I
and IGFBP-3.
Overall, these assays showed moderately high CVs for both
analytes. Comparison with past studies is not always easy
because very few details are given about QC efforts and
analysis in many epidemiologic studies involving IGFs or
other serum components. A little more detail about QC and
sample storage conditions in such studies could help improve
comparisons among studies and assessment of study quality.
Variation in assay performance has been suggested as a cause
of heterogeneity in epidemiologic studies of associations
between cancer and the IGF system (2, 28), and a recent study
suggests that the performance of a commonly used DSL ELISA
for IGFBP-3 may have changed over time (16). Better methods
of measuring biologically relevant aspects of the IGF system in
serum and in specific tissues are needed to improve our
understanding of the epidemiology of cancer and the IGF
system.
Sample degradation can be a problem for studies of serum
analytes with long, complex storage histories. Time at room
temperature, storage temperature, and number of freeze-thaw
cycles have been suggested as potential factors influencing
stability of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (18, 26, 29). For example, delays
in shipping before freezing samples reduced IGFBP-3 levels by
3% (18), but IGF-I and IGFBP-3 seemed to be stable in response
to five freeze-thaw cycles in a study (26) using IRMA from
DSL. We are unaware of studies examining the interactive
effects of freeze-thaw cycles, time at room temperature, and
duration of storage. In any case, careful attention should be
paid to storage history, and our experiences clearly indicate
that a subset of representative samples should be tested before
embarking on a large study. Detailed records of sample history
would facilitate assessment of potential causes of sample
degradation. Lastly, availability of reference values from
diverse studies should help in the evaluation of sample
integrity.
This article highlights the need for careful consideration of
sample storage and handling history, and it documents the
performance of commonly used assays for IGF-I and IGFBP-3
in a large cross-sectional study that included subjects

representing a wide range of age, socio-demographic, and
health status characteristics. Assay performance was stable
over time but CVs of f10% for both analytes will reduce study
power. On the other hand, both analytes have substantial
between-person variability, potentially allowing assessment of
associations between the IGF axis and the demographic,
behavioral, and health-related variables. These results should
help guide the design and analysis of future studies of IGF-I
and IGFBP-3, candidate biomarkers of cancer risk, and
potential targets for chemopreventive interventions at several
sites.
