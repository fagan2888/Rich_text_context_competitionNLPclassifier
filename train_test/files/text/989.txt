Abstract
Objective: This paper explores the unique nutrition transition shifts in diet and activity
patterns from the period termed the receding famine pattern to the one dominated by
nutrition-related non-communicable diseases (NR-NCDs). The paper examines the
speed and timing of these changes; unique components, such as the issue of finding
both under- and overnutrition in the same household; potential exacerbating
biological relationships that contribute to differences in the rates of change; and
political issues.
Setting: The focus is on lower- and middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, the
Middle East and Latin America.
Results: These changes are occurring at great speed and at earlier stages of these
countries' economic and social development. There are some unique issues that
relate to body composition and potential genetic factors. The significance of the high
number of persons exposed to heavy insults during pregnancy and infancy (foetal
origins hypothesis) and the subsequent rapid shifts in energy imbalance remains to be
understood. Countries that are still addressing major concerns of undernutrition are
not ready to address these NR-NCDs.
Conclusions: The developing world needs to give far greater emphasis to addressing
the prevention of the adverse health consequences of this shift to the nutrition
transition stage of degenerative diseases.

Scholars and policy-makers who focus on obesity and
nutrition-related non-communicable disease (NR-NCD)
issues in the developing world often assert that the
situation facing developing countries is unique. But is the
experience related to the rapid onset of obesity and NR-
NCDs in the lower- and middle-income countries of Asia,
Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Oceana
different from what occurred in Western European
countries, the United States and Japan at a similar stage
in their economic development? An exploration of the
`differences' in the speed of the nutrition transition across
the globe is beyond the scope of this paper but certainly is
worthy of future exploration. This paper summarises some
arguments and evidence that lead us to assert that the
experience (rapid onset of obesity and NR-NCDs) may be
unique. Understanding this topic is important for planning
a strategy to prevent obesity and its complications in the
developing world. In this paper we focus on several ways
the conditions in higher-income Western European
countries, the USA and Japan differ from those in lower-
and middle-income countries. Essentially the key asser-
tions are as follows.
. The speed of change appears unique due to the timing
of the economic, technological and social transform-
ations faced by lower- and moderate-income transi-
tional societies now, and that faced by higher-income
industrialised societies decades ago.
. The unique issue of finding both under- and over-
nutrition in the same household is indicative of the
different sets of stresses and societal changes currently
facing lower- and moderate-income countries shifting
to a pattern of NR-NCDs.
. The differences in the rates of change may be
exacerbated by some biological relationships.
. The politics differ, as does the capacity of these
countries to address the rapid increase in the prevalence
of NR-NCDs.

Assertion 1 ­ The shifts in dietary and activity
patterns and body composition seem to be
occurring more rapidly
The pace of the rapid nutrition transition shifts in diet and
activity patterns from the period termed the receding
famine pattern to one dominated by NR-NCDs seems to be
accelerating in the lower- and middle-income transitional
countries. We use nutrition rather than diet so that the term
NR-NCD incorporates the effects of diet, physical activity
and body composition rather than solely focusing on
dietary patterns and their effects. This is based partially on
incomplete information that seems to indicate that the
prevalences of obesity and a number of NR-NCDs are
increasing far more quickly in the lower- and middle-
income world than they have in the West. Another element
is that the rapid change in urban populations is much
greater than that experienced a century or less ago in the
West; yet another is the shift in occupation structure and
the rapid introduction of the modern mass media.
Underlying such changes is a general concern for rapid
globalisation as the root cause.
Clearly, there are quantitative and qualitative dimen-
sions to these changes. On the one hand, changes towards
a high-density diet, reduced complex carbohydrates and
other important elements and inactivity may be proceed-
ing faster than in the past. The shift from labour-intensive
occupations and leisure activities towards more capital-
intensive, less strenuous work and leisure is also occurring
faster. On the other hand, qualitative dimensions related to
multidimensional aspects of the diet, activity, body
composition and disease shifts may exist. The social and
economic stresses people face and feel as these changes
occur might also be included.
At the start of the new millennium, scholars often feel as
if the pace and complexity of life, reflected in all aspects of
work and play, are increasing exponentially; there are also
unanticipated developments, new technologies and the
impact of a very modern, high-powered communications
system. It is this sense of rapid change that makes it so
important to understand what is happening and anticipate
the way changes in patterns of diet, activity and body
composition are occurring. While the penetration and
influence of modern communications, technology and
economic systems ­ related to what is termed globalisa-
tion ­ have been a dominant theme of the last few
decades, there seem to be some unique issues that have
led to a rapid increase of `globalisation and its impact'.
Placing the blame on globalisation is, on the one hand,
focusing on a broad and vaguely measured set of forces;
this ignores the need to be focused and specific, which
would allow us to develop potentially viable policy
options. It is difficult to measure each element of this
globalisation equation and its impact. These processes
certainly have been expanded, as indicated by enhanced
free trade, a push towards the reduction of trade barriers in
the developing world, and the increasing penetration of
international corporations into the commerce in each
country (measured by share of gross national product
(GNP) or manufacturing). Similarly, other economic issues
related to enhanced value given to market forces and
international capital markets are important. Equally, the
increasing access to Western media and the removal of
communication barriers enhanced by the World Wide
Web, cable TV, mobile telephone systems, etc. are
important. The accelerated introduction of Western
technology into manufacturing, the basic sectors of
agriculture, mining and services is also a key element.
Another way to consider the types of change the
developing world is facing is to consider an urban
squatter's life and a rural villager's life in China, 20 years
ago and today. During the 1970s, food supply concerns
still existed, there was no television, limited bus and mass
transportation, little food trade, minimal processed food
existed, and most rural and urban occupations were very
labour-intensive. Today, work and life activities have
changed: small gas-powered tractors are available,
modern industrial techniques are multiplying, offices are
quite automated, soft drinks and many processed foods
are found everywhere, TVs are found in about 89% of
households (at least a fifth of which are linked to Hong
Kong Star and Western advertising and programming),
younger children do not ride bicycles, and mass transit has
become heavily used. Multiply such changes by similar
ones occurring in much of Asia, North Africa, the Middle
East, Latin America and many areas (particularly cities) in
sub-Saharan Africa and it is evident that the shift from a
subsistence economy to a modern, industrialised one
occurred in a span of 10­20 years. In Europe and other
industrialised, high-income societies, this occurred over
many decades or centuries.
To truly measure and examine these issues, we would
need to compare changes in the period 1980­2000, for
countries that are low- and middle-income, with changes
that occurred half a century earlier for the developed
world. However, data on diet and activity patterns are not
available and there are only minimal data on NR-NCDs
and obesity.
The elements of the nutrition transition that we know to
be negatively linked with NR-NCDs are obesity, adverse
dietary changes (e.g. shifts in structure of the diet towards
a greater role for higher fat and added sugar foods,
reduced fruit and vegetable intakes, reduced fibre intake,
greater energy density and greater saturated fat intake),
and reduced physical activity in work and leisure. We
focus on these first and then a few select underlying
factors. The causes of these elements of the nutrition
transition are not as well understood as the trends in each
of them. In fact, there are few studies attempting to study
the causes of such changes and there are only a few
datasets that are equipped to allow such crucial policy
analyses to be undertaken.

Obesity trends
Many of the papers in this volume, and others we have
published (e.g. Popkin and Doak1), highlight the trends in
obesity. In this paper, we present one set of comparable
results for children and adolescents and another for
Chinese adults to highlight the rapidity of change. In
China, we examined shifts in body composition among
adults, aged 20­45 years, over an 8-year period2. As we
have shown2, not only did mean body mass index (BMI)
increase, but the shape of the BMI distribution curve
changed over the 8-year period (Fig. 1). From 1989 to 1997
the proportion of underweight men and women dropped
considerably and the prevalence of both overweight and
obesity increased greatly. In fact, the proportion of
overweight or obese men more than doubled from 6.4.0%
to 14.5% and the proportion of overweight or obese
women increased 50% from 11.5% to 16.2%.
China might be unique; we cannot show such a
dramatic shift for other countries owing to a lack of
baseline data (except for Brazil where surveys in the
1970s, `80s and `90s exist3 ­6). Other comparable data do
not exist for in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and
Asia that show very high levels of current obesity (e.g.
Egypt) which would allow us to understand if these
current high levels are the result of recent changes.
One of the regions representing a combination of
middle- and lower-income countries that is experiencing
very high obesity rates is North Africa and sub-Saharan
Africa. Figure 27 ­15 summarises results from representative
surveys in a number of countries in North Africa and the
Middle East. Although these are very high levels, they are
no less astonishing than the results of a recent, nationally
representative survey of women of child-bearing age, 15­
45 years, from South Africa. The South African Demo-
graphic and Health Survey collected weight and height
data from women16 and found that among black (African)
women, 44.4% had a BMI above 30.0 kg m22. Only 7.9% of
the adult men in these households were obese.
We have looked at the trends in underweight and
overweight older children, aged 6­10 years, and
adolescents, aged 11­18 years, in China, Russia, Brazil
and the USA17. In this case, we found the average rate of
increase in the prevalence of overweight status over the
last two decades to be comparable among US and
Brazilian children and adolescents, but lower among the
Chinese. Use of more recent data shows a more rapid and
very high increase in Brazil in the last decade whereas
obesity declined in Russia, where an economic crisis and
the removal of food subsidies for meat and dairy products
led to a remarkable decline in the energy density of
children's diets18.
Dietary changes: shift in the overall structure over
time
The diets of the developing world are shifting equally
rapidly. We do not have good data for most countries on
total energy intake, but we do have reasonable data to
examine shifts in the structure of the diet. Food balance
data were used to examine the shift, over time, in the
proportion of energy from fat19.
The dramatic changes in the aggregate income­fat
relationship from 1962 to 1990 are displayed in Fig. 3 by
the estimated regression lines based on cubic polynomial
regressions19. Most significantly, even the poor nations
had access to a relatively high-fat diet by 1990, when a diet
deriving 20% of energy (kcal) from fat was associated with
countries having a GNP of only $750 per capita. On the
other hand, in 1962, the same energy diet (20% from fat)
was associated with countries having a per capita GNP of
$1475 (both GNP values in 1993 US$). This dramatic
change arose from a major increase (from 10 to 13%) in the
consumption of vegetable fats by poor and rich nations;

similar increases (3­6%) also occurred in middle- and
high-income nations.
At the same time there were decreases in the
consumption of fat from animal sources for all except
the low-income countries. The availability of animal fats
continued to be linked to income, though less strongly in
1990 than in 1962. These decreases, combined with the
increase in vegetable fat intake for countries of all
incomes, resulted in an overall decrease in fat intake for
moderate-income countries of about 3%, but an increase
of about 4­5% for low- and high-income countries. Figure
3 indicates these substantial shifts in the relationships
between GNP and the composition of diets over time.
Vegetable fats in 1990 accounted for a greater
proportion of dietary energy than animal fats for countries
in the lowest 75% of countries (all of which have incomes
below $5800 per capita) of the per capita income
distribution. The absolute level of vegetable fat consump-

tion increased, but there remained at most a weak
association of GNP and vegetable fat intake in these
aggregate data. The change in edible vegetable fat prices,
supply and consumption is unique because it equally
affected rich and poor countries, but the net impact is
relatively much greater on low-income countries.
We have shown elsewhere that there was also an
equally large and important shift in the proportion of
energy from added sugar in the diets of lower-income
countries20.
When we specifically examine the combined effect of
these various shifts in the structure of rural and urban
Chinese diets21, we find an upward shift in the energy
density of the foods consumed. In this study, the kcal of
energy intake from foods and alcohol per 100 g of food in
both urban and rural Chinese adult diets increased by over
10% (to 2.42) between 1989 and 1997. These are very rapid
shifts in energy density. It is important to note that this
value of 2.42 is not comparable with the normal measure
of energy density of the diet. The normal method includes
full measures of all beverages, while the Chinese Food
Composition Table, from which these data were extracted,
measures only a few beverages (milk, coconut juice,
sugarcane juice, spirits, beer, wine, champagne and
brandy) and excludes many beverages, in particular tea
and coffee. There are a number of clinical studies that
varied the energy density of the diet in ad libitum studies.
Each finds that higher density increases, often only an
increase as low as from 1 kcal g21 to 1.3 kcal g21, can
increase total energy intake22,23. For these reasons, energy
density changes in China, and most likely in other
developing countries, are critical components of dietary
change to be monitored.
Physical activity shifts are equally rapid
There are much fewer data and less analysis on the shifts,
over time, in energy expenditures and physical activity
patterns in general. Some published studies have
demonstrated the remarkable shift in the structure of
occupations, as well as in the activities performed in each
occupation24,25. However, we have few publications or
data that have documented either physical activity patterns
or precisely measured data on the physical activity
component of total energy expenditures for adults and
children in the developing world. There is no basis to state
that there have been shifts in the other components of
energy expenditures (e.g. basal metabolic rates), so we
focus on physical activity except for selected disease shifts
(e.g. reductions in parasitic infection and other infectious
disease that might have some independent effect on
energy expenditures).
We rely on the China Health and Nutrition Survey
(CHNS) results with adult physical activity patterns
measured over the 1989­97 period to examine this
topic. Figure 4 shows a remarkable downward shift for the
proportion of adults, aged 20­45 years, whose daily
activity profile categorises them in a moderate category,
compared with those in the light category, over the last
decade. In other work, we have shown that light and
moderate activity profiles are linked with greater
obesity2,26.
Rapid social change is important: urbanisation,
rapid demographic change and other behavioural
changes are occurring simultaneously
In this section, our focus is on the ways diets have shifted
in urban areas and with other sociodemographic changes

in the past several decades, rather than on how the age
structure and spatial distribution of the population in the
developing world have changed dramatically during the
past three decades27. Although we do not address these
issues here, there are several points to note about these
key elements:
. rapid reductions in fertility have enhanced the shift in
the age distribution;
. urbanisation continues unabated in Asia and Africa.
More poor will reside in urban than rural areas in future
decades;
. economic changes, in particular increased income and
income inequality, appear to define changes in many
regions of the developing world; and
. globalisation of mass media is occurring at an earlier
stage of economic development than faced higher-
income countries in the past.
The two major themes in this section ­ (1) rapid change
for some and (2) how greater social inequality between
rich and poor defines the current nutrition transition facing
lower- and middle-income countries ­ will be addressed.
Urbanisation
In other published work we have shown how the structure
of the diet has shifted markedly as populations have
urbanised20. This relationship will, by itself, shift the
structure of the diet significantly at the national level as
urbanisation continues and as the proportion of the
population in urban areas grows.
Structural shifts in income­diet relationships are
occurring
Economists speak of two types of behavioural change.
One relates to shifts in the composition of society
regarding the plurality of the educated, rich or urban
residents. The other type relates to the way persons with
different characteristics behave and, in our case, economic
behaviour. This latter type, termed changes in behaviour,
means that for the same level of education or income, a
person would buy different amounts or types of
commodities at different points in time. Research
conducted in China shows there have been profound
behavioural shifts during the last decade (i.e. for each
extra dollar of income, additional high-fat foods are
purchased vs. what would have been purchased in
previous years for the equivalent extra dollar)19. Econom-
ists speak of this effect as one that shows how the
decision-making demand pattern for food has changed, so
for the same income level the patterns of demand have
changed significantly from earlier periods. Figure 5 shows
how extra income in China affects the poor differentially
than the rich, enhancing the fat intake of the poor more
than the rich; the changes from 1989 to 1993 were
statistically significant for both groups. The explosion in
access and exposure to mass media may very well have
created this situation.
Mass media
There is no doubt that access to modern mass media has
grown very rapidly, particularly in the last decade.
Elsewhere, we have shown world-wide trends. It is very
useful to look at the proportion of households in a country
that own a television set to gain insight into this topic.
Again we use CHNS data to reflect the types of change in
one setting. Figure 6 shows the proportion of low-,
middle- and upper-income tertile households that owned
a TV during the 1989­97 period. Overall, 88.5% of Chinese
households in the CHNS sample owned a TV in 1997. It is
important to note that, in China, not only was the

proportion of people with access to television shifting, but
the types of programmes and access to Western influences
were also shifting. In the 1980s, cable systems in China did
not provide outside programming, but by 1997 many
provinces provided access to China Star, a Hong Kong
television system that relies heavily on US and British
programming and provides modern TV advertising.
Again, while there are no extensive data on the
proportion of Chinese households with access to mass
media 30­70 years ago, we certainly know that the
penetration into Chinese households in 1997 is far greater
than it was into US households 50 years ago; TV was in its
infancy then.
Assertion 2 ­ The joint presence of undernutrition
and overweight seems to be important
There are two related issues: (1) at the societal level,
endemic levels of undernutrition and overnutrition exist in
many countries and (2) often at the same time in the same
household. India is a prime example of the first point. One
well-designed representative survey (the National Family
Health Survey, 1998­99) of nearly 83 000 women aged
15­45 years found that one main problem continues to be
undernutrition, with 36% of the women having a low BMI
(,18.5 kg m22)28,29. However, 11% of the women can be
classified as overweight (BMI . 25 kg m22) and 2% are
obese (BMI . 30 kg m22). There were significant differ-
ences between urban and rural residents, with 41% of the
rural women having a low BMI contrasted with 23% of the
urban women; and only 6% of the rural women were
overweight or obese, compared with 24% for urban
women. Many other examples abound; South Africa has a
very high rate of adult female overweight and obesity
(44%) and also large proportions of malnourished
children16.
The work of Doak and others to highlight the large
proportion of households in which persons with both low
and high BMI coexist, reflective of undernutrition and
overnutrition, is important. She and her colleagues have
shown that this is the case in both rich and poor families
from many developing countries. A representative sample
in Indonesian households revealing the prevalence of
almost 10% of all households having members with both
low and high BMI is most interesting30,31.
The fact that low-income households in many regions of
the world have high levels of overweight members is
indicative of a rather new phenomenon in the developing
world, one of household food insecurity coupled with an
energy imbalance. The exact implications of this
phenomenon need to be much more fully understood.
Assertion 3 ­ Is the biology different? Or rather, do
we have different social structures and body
composition patterns that affect BMI­disease
relationships? Or are there genetic variants that are
important?
There are a number of different ways these questions
could be answered in the affirmative. One is if the body
composition and other unmeasured race­ethnic factors
affect susceptibility to NR-NCDs. Another might be if
previous disease patterns (e.g. the presence of malaria or
other tropical diseases) led to disease patterns that
predisposed the population to certain problems. One

component of this might be the foetal insult syndrome
developed and popularised by Barker32,33.
There has been a growing body of research showing
that the international standards used to delineate who is
overweight and obese are not appropriate for many large
sub-populations in the world. For instance, a BMI of
25 kg m22 in an Asian adult appears to have a far greater
adverse metabolic effect than in a Caucasian adult34. In
fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) formed a group
of scientists and agencies in Asia to review this topic. This
group held international meetings and has proposed a
lower BMI cut-off for Asians of 23 kg m22 for overweight
and of 25 kg m22 for obesity35. In one paper comparing
China, the Philippines and US Hispanics, blacks and
whites, the odds of being hypertensive were higher for
Chinese men and women than for the other sub-
population groups at lower BMI values in the 23­
25 kg m22 range36. Ethnic differences in the strength of the
association between BMI and disease outcomes warrant
further consideration.
Zimmet and others, who have focused on this issue as it
relates to lower-income countries, felt that the highest
genetic susceptibility for adult-onset diabetes was for
Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Mexican Americans
and other Hispanics, and Asian Indians. Those with
modest genetic susceptibility include Africans, Japanese
and Chinese37,38. The age of onset (usually after the age of
50 years) of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(NIDDM) is much lower for these susceptible populations
and it appears that the prevalence is higher for a given
level of obesity and waist/hip ratio. Zimmet and co-
workers37,38 summarise a large selection of literature that
has explored these issues relating to diabetes among
susceptible populations.
What is not clear is how much of this difference
between sub-populations' BMI­diabetes or other BMI­
morbidity relationships is a function of differences of body
composition, metabolic or genetic factors, or social causes.
Elsewhere we have shown that part of the apparent race­
hypertension relationship may also be explained partially
by socio-economic status39.
There is another pathway related to the role of previous
health problems for which we have less understanding
and no real documentation of its impact. Examples would
be malnutrition that caused a virus to mutate, parasitic
infections that affected long-term absorption patterns, or a
parasite that is linked with an unknown genotype ­
comparable to sickle cell anaemia and its evolutionary
linkage with malaria. We have no basis for speculation
about this potential pathway.
However, the final pathway ­ the effect of foetal and
infant insults on subsequent metabolic function ­ is one
that appears to be a critical area. If the rapid shifts towards
positive energy imbalance are occurring concurrently with
higher levels of low birth weight in a population, then this
becomes a much more salient aspect of this argument. In
the developing world, where intrauterine malnutrition
rates are high and a high prevalence of nutrition insults
during infancy exists, the work of Barker and many others
portends important potential effects on the prevalence of
NR-NCDs in the coming decades33,40. Not only is there an
emerging consensus that foetal insults ­ in particular with
regard to thin, low-birth-weight infants who subsequently
face a shift in the stage of the transition and become
overweight ­ are linked with increased risk of NR-NCDs,
but infancy may equally be a period of high vulnerability.
Three new studies by Hoffman et al.41 ­43 suggest that the
fat metabolism of stunted infants is impaired to the extent
that this could lead to increased obesity and other
metabolic shifts. Other work on the role of stunting on
obesity had suggested such an effect, but Hoffman et al.'s
work suggests the mechanism and fits with the correla-
tional work44.
Assertion 4 ­ The politics are different in the
developing world and lead to a programme and
policy dilemma! The capacity to address the rapid
increase in NR-NCDs does not exist as it did at this
stage in higher-income countries!
In the countries of the developing world, where the
politicians have focused for decades on issues of hunger
and infectious diseases, we face a major challenge in
getting focus on the prevention of obesity and NR-NCDs.
The rapidity of the increases in obesity and many NR-
NCDs is an indication of the need for preventive action.
The ultimate challenge is to get countries that are poor
to develop a preventive public health agenda rather than
relying on subsequent treatment. The examples from Latin
America, where hunger-oriented programmes that
ignored the issues of obesity actually led to increased
obesity45, strengthen the arguments for this approach.
Another concern is the large proportion of lower-
income households with separate individuals who have
under- and overweight at the same time. The key point is
Doak et al.'s findings of large proportions of households
with underweight and overweight members simul-
taneously30,31.
Finally, the NR-NCDs increased in prevalence slowly in
the higher-income countries; medical systems had time to
adjust to the needs; public health systems were able to
begin addressing the situations; and individual treatments
could be undertaken because incomes were higher.
Effective public health interventions have rarely been
adopted.
The collective wisdom of the Bellagio meeting will
focus on this topic as one of the more important issues that
ultimately needs to be addressed.

Discussion
The shift towards the nutrition transition stage linked with
a high level of NR-NCDs is finding most lower- and
middle-income countries unprepared. The changes are
occurring very rapidly and the costs, in terms of health, are
great. Large populations are still undernourished and
programmes and policies to address these new changes in
a preventive way are not being developed. Further
understanding of the causes and consequences of these
shifts must be forthcoming and far greater priority needs to
be given to the area of prevention.
