Introduction
The prevalence of obesity among US adults aged 60 and older is
estimated to be 37.4% by 2010, up from 32% in the year 2000.
The prevalence of normal weight in this age group is expected
to decrease to 26.7% by 2010, down from 30.6% in 2000 (1).
The latest Centers for Disease Control estimates for 2009 show
the prevalence of self-reported obesity to be 30.9% among per-
sons aged 60­69 years and 20.5% among persons 70 years and
older. Currently, the Agency on Aging, estimates the US popu-
lation of adults 65 and older to be near 40 million (2). The US
Census Bureau has projected the elder population of US adults
to be 88.5 million by the year 2050. If the current projections
hold true, the prevalence of obesity will continue to rise among
older Americans.
The negative impact of obesity, commonly measured by the
BMI, on various diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hyperten-
sion, congestive heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease is well established (3,4). In addition, obes-
ity has been shown to worsen physical functioning and health
related quality of life (5,6). From an economic perspective,
obesity is also linked to higher health-care expenditures. In
fact, the annual expenditures for overweight and obesity were
estimated to reach as high as $147 billion in 2008 (7). Yang and
Hall (2008), have demonstrated that among the elderly, men
who were overweight or obese at age 65, had higher in-patient,
outpatient, and prescription expenditures over their lifetime
than men who were normal weight. Average total health-care
expenditures were 6% and 12.5% higher for overweight and
obese men when compared to normal weight men. Women,
who were overweight or obese at age 65, had higher in-patient,
outpatient, prescription and nursing home expenditures over
their lifetime than women who were normal weight. Average
total health-care expenditures were 10.7% and 16.8% higher
for overweight and obese women when compared to normal
weight women (8).
However, there is no conclusive evidence on whether chang-
ing BMI categories (i.e., weight loss or weight gain) is related
to short-term reductions in health-care expenditures. In one
Changing BMI Categories and Healthcare
Expenditures Among Elderly Medicare
Beneficiaries
Tricia Lee Wilkins1, George S. Rust2 and Usha Sambamoorthi1,2
To examine the association between changes in BMI categories and health-care expenditures among elderly Medicare
beneficiaries using longitudinal data of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) 2000­2005. Changes in BMI
were (i) Stayed Normal: individuals with a normal BMI at baseline and follow-up; (ii) Stayed Overweight individuals
with overweight BMI at baseline and follow-up; (iii) Stayed Obese individuals with obese BMI at baseline and follow-
up; (iv) Normal-Overweight: individuals with normal BMI at baseline and overweight BMI at follow-up; (v) Overweight-
Obese: individuals with overweight BMI at baseline and obese BMI at follow-up; (vi) Overweight-Normal: individuals
with overweight BMI at baseline and normal BMI at follow-up; (vii) Obese-Overweight: individuals with obese BMI
at baseline and overweight BMI at follow-up. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models on logged Year 3 expenditures
were used to analyze changes in expenditures between BMI categories. Overall, 35% Stayed Normal, 34% Stayed
Overweight, 18% Stayed Obese, 4% gained weight from Normal-Overweight BMI, 3% gained weight from Overweight-
Obese BMI, 5% lost weight from Overweight-Normal BMI, and 3% lost weight from Obese-Overweight BMI. Adjusted
models revealed those who Stayed Obese had increased total and multiple expenditure types that were significantly
higher than Stayed Normal including total (11%), outpatient (25%), prescription (9%), and medical provider (4%).
Compared to Stayed Normal, total expenditures were both 26% higher for Obese-Overweight and Overweight-Obese.
The current findings highlight the importance of maintaining a normal BMI in the elderly.

prospective study, 965 obese Swedish subjects of mean age 47.8
years,werefollowedfor6yearspostintervention(surgicalorcon-
ventional weight loss). Changes in medication costs were found
to be dependent on the magnitude of weight lost. The annual
costs of diabetes and cardiovascular medications decreased by
8% for those losing >15% baseline body weight. However, medi-
cation costs increased for individuals losing <15% baseline body
weight. The largest increase in medication costs, 96%, was seen
for those who lost <5% baseline body weight (9).
CollinsandAnderson(1995),evaluatedtheeconomicimpact
of weight loss among 40 obese individuals aged 40­70 years.
At 12 week follow-up, subjects had lost an average of 15 lbs,
and monthly prescription costs for hypertension and diabetes
medications were $20, down from $63.30 at baseline. By 1 year
follow-up, subjects had lost an average of 20 lbs and average
monthly prescription costs were $32.40 (10). Dynamic mod-
eling of sustained 10% weight loss decreased lifetime health-
care expenditures due to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke by as much
as $2,200­$5,300 (11). Another simulation study aimed to pre-
dict the return on investment for workplace obesity interven-
tions. Annual savings due to medical costs and absenteeism
were estimated to be $90 per worker for those achieving at least
5% weight loss (12). In a follow-up study, Finkelstein et al.,
merged medical claims and absenteeism data for employees
from 17 North Carolina based colleges. In this study however,
overweight and obese participants with at least 5% weight loss
did not have lower medical expenditures or absenteeism at 12
or 24 months (13).
These studies have made important contributions by study-
ing weight loss and its relationship to health-care expenditures.
From these studies we know that obesity results in higher
health-care expenditures over a lifespan, that weight reduc-
tion can curb increases in areas such as medication costs and
the relationship between health-care expenditures and weight
depends on the amount of weight lost. Whereas, some authors
demonstrated this relationship in terms of absolute pounds
lost, others expressed weight loss in terms of relative per-
centages. Despite these differences, these studies have shown
that the changes in health-care expenditures resulting from
weight loss cannot be ignored. However, these studies have
limitations. Some have examined only changes in prescription
expenditures (9,10,14) some studies focused only on specific
conditions such as diabetes (9), while still others included only
selected populations (i.e., employees).
Given that the obesity epidemic is prevalent not just in the
general population, but with the elderly as well, it is important
to analyze the effect of weight loss in this population. Since
the elderly are particularly at risk for chronic conditions (15),
obesity may increase comorbid complications and contribute
to higher excess expenditures compared to the nonelderly. In
addition, studies that analyze all components of expenditures
within an elderly population, regardless of chronic conditions
can help providers, patients, and policy makers gain a pic-
ture of the overall financial impact of obesity with this group.
Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the
effects of changing BMI on a variety of health expenditures,
including total, in-patient, outpatient, medical, prescription,
dental, and other among the elderly, using a nationally repre-
sentative survey of Medicare beneficiaries.
Methods and Procedures
Data
The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) is a "nationally rep-
resentative sample of aged, disabled, and institutionalized Medicare
beneficiaries" (16). The MCBS data consists of two annually released
public use files: "access to care" and "cost and use". The "cost and use"
files contain information on personal health-care expenditures and
payment sources for all beneficiaries who were eligible for Medicare
at any time throughout the calendar year. Sources of information
on expenditures and utilization for health-care services include in-
person interviews conducted every 4 months as well as Medicare
claims. The two data files can be used separately or (for those enrolled
for the full year) in combination. The current project utilized the "cost
and use" files.
We analyzed merged data from multiple years of the MCBS; 2000­
2005. From these files, four longitudinal panels were created: (i) 2000­
2002, (ii) 2001­2003, (iii) 2002­2004 and (iv) 2003­2005. Each panel
contains a nationally representative sample of beneficiaries who were
interviewed 12 times to collect 3 complete years of utilization data. Each
panel consists of a unique set of beneficiaries, not present in any other
panel. In addition, variables chosen for analysis were coded consistently
across all years. For our analyses, the first year of each panel served as
the baseline (year 1) for that respective panel (i.e., 2000, 2001, 2002, and
2003). Year 2 and year 3 were defined as the two chronological years fol-
lowing each panel's baseline year.
To arrive at these panels, we only included those who were first inter-
viewed in the year of observation. For example, of the 13,051 individuals
interviewed in the year 2000, 4,547 were interviewed for the first time,
of which 3,663 were followed for 3 years of interviewing. Of the 12,864
individuals interviewed in the year 2001, 4,471 were interviewed for the
first time, of which 3,615 were followed for 3 years of interviewing. Of the
12,697 individuals interviewed in the year 2002, 4,308 were interviewed
for the first time, of which 3,402 were followed for 3 years of interview-
ing. Lastly, of the 12,486 individuals interviewed in the year 2003, 4,337
were interviewed for the first time, of which 3,452 were followed for three
years of interviewing.
Analytic sample: inclusion/exclusion criteria
The analytical sample included individuals: (i) who were commu-
nity dwelling and were followed for all 3 years, (ii) aged 65 years and
older, (iii) with full-year enrollment in Medicare parts A and B during
year 1 and (iv) had no missing BMI values for the years BMI changes
were measured. The following individuals were excluded: (i) individu-
als who were underweight, (ii) those who had extreme fluctuations in
weight such as those from a normal BMI to obese BMI and (iii) those
who changed weight from an obese BMI to normal BMI over the 2
year period of measurement. After exclusions, the analytical sample
consisted of 10,300 Medicare beneficiaries, with a similar distribution
across panels: 2000­2002 (n = 2,636); 2001­2003 (n = 2,645); 2002­
2004 (n = 2,478); and 2003­2005 (n = 2,541).
Dependent variable: changes in expenditures
Expenditure data consisted of payments made by third-party pay-
ers including Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare-Health Maintenance
Organizations (HMO), Veterans Affairs Health Insurance, private
HMO, individually purchased insurance, employer-sponsored insur-
ance, other payers and those paid by self or family. Expenditure types
include total, in-patient, outpatient, medical providers, prescription,
dental, and other. Other expenditures cover payments made for facil-
ity, home health, and institutional. The analyses presented here evalu-
ate changes in total, in-patient, outpatient, prescription, and medical

add to the sum of listed expenditures, the difference reflects excluded
dental and other expenditures. Medicare expenditures represent those
obtained from both the survey and administrative bills for Medicare
payments. To create an accurate picture of amounts paid, the files have
undergone a careful reconciliation process that identifies payments
recorded on the survey only, the Medicare bill only, or on both (17).
Expenditures from non-Medicare payers were obtained by self-report.
In all analyses expenditures were transformed to constant dollars and
represented in 2005 dollars using the annual consumer price index for
medical care services available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://
data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost, Accessed 30 August 2010). The Medical
consumer price index accounts for inflation across the following sec-
tors: professional services, hospital and related services, health insurance,
medicinal drugs, and medical equipment/supplies. We also transformed
expenditures to natural logarithm to enable us to fit a liner model and
improve normality in the expenditure data.
Key independent variable
BMI categories. BMI was calculated by BMI = weight (kg)/height
(m2). We used the following Centers for Disease Control's criterion to
categorize BMI groups: (i) underweight (BMI <18.5kg/m2); (ii) nor-
mal weight (18.5­24.9kg/m2); (iii) overweight (25­29.9kg/m2); (iv)
obese (BMI 30kg/m2) (www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/
adult_bmi/index.htm, Accessed December 2010). In each year, BMI
was calculated using baseline height.
Changes in BMI were measured between year 1 and year 2, and were
grouped into the following categories used to predict expenditures in year
3: (i) Stayed Normal: individuals with a normal BMI (18.5­24.9kg/m2) at
baseline and follow-up; (ii) Normal-Overweight: individuals with normal
BMI at baseline and overweight BMI (25­29.9kg/m2) at follow-up; (iii)
Overweight-Normal: individuals with overweight BMI at baseline and
normal BMI at follow-up; (iv) Stayed Overweight: individuals with over-
weight BMI at baseline and follow-up; (v) Overweight-Obese: individuals
with overweight BMI at baseline and obese BMI (30kg/m2) at follow-up;
(vi) Obese-Overweight: individuals with obese BMI at baseline and over-
weight BMI at follow-up; (vii) Stayed Obese: individuals with obese BMI
at baseline and follow-up. The following individuals were excluded: (i)
individuals who were underweight, (ii) those who changed weight from
normal BMI to obese BMI and (iii) those who changed weight from obese
BMI to normal BMI over the 2 year period of measurement.
Other independent variables
Demographic Variables consisted of gender (women, men), race/
ethnicity (white, African American, Latino, other), age marital status
(married, widowed, divorced/separated, never married), and metropol-
itan status (metro, nonmetro). Variables representing socioeconomic
status included education (less than high school, high school, greater
than high school), poverty status (as a percentage of the Federal Poverty
Level (FPL): < 200% FPL, >200% FPL), having supplemental private
insurance (yes, no), and dually enrolled in Medicaid (yes, no).
Statistical methods
The 2 test of independence was used to determine significance between
BMI change categories and subject characteristics. Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) models on logged year 3 expenditures were used to ana-
lyze changes in expenditures between BMI change categories. Models
were adjusted for the following independent variables: gender, race/
ethnicity, education, poverty status, Medicaid status, insurance type,
general health, smoking status, depression, and baseline expenditures.
All analyses controlled for the complex sample design of MCBS and
were conducted using Statistical Analysis System (SAS version 9.2; SAS,
Cary, North Carolina) using survey procedures.
Results
At baseline (year 1), the analytical sample (n = 10,300) was
mostly female (57%), white (81%), and more individuals were
of the age group 65­69 years (31%) (Table 1). Most individuals
were married (57%) and lived within a metro community
(77%). More individuals had only a high school education
(37%), with an even split between individuals living below
200% federal poverty (51%) and those above (49%). A third
of the sample reported having good physical health (33%),
and 10% were current smokers. History of chronic disease/ill-
ness formed the following distribution (data not presented in
tabular form); arthritis (59%), cancer (32%), diabetes (19%),
heart disease (35%), hypertension (58%), stroke (10%), respi-
ratory diseases (13%), osteoporosis (18%), any mental illness
(10%), and baseline depression (12%). In addition, at year 1,
based on BMI categories, 37% of the study sample was normal
weight (n = 3,946), 41% overweight (n = 4,206), and 22% obese
(n = 2,148).
Subgroup differences in BMI change categories:
bivariate analysis
The bivariate analysis between groups of BMI change catego-
ries showed significant differences between groups for all inde-
pendent variables tested (Table 2). Results showed that 35% of
the study sample Stayed Normal, 34% Stayed Overweight, 18%
Stayed Obese, 4% increased weight from normal BMI to over-
weight, 3% increased weight from overweight BMI to obese,
5% decreased weight from overweight BMI to normal, and 3%
decreased weight from obese BMI to overweight.
Unadjusted models of year 3 expenditures
Table 3 shows a comparison of year 3 expenditures by BMI
change categories. An unadjusted OLS model on logged year
3 expenditures was used to determine statistically significant
differences between BMI change categories and the reference
group, Stayed Normal. Based on the unadjusted model, total
expenditures were significantly higher for Stayed Obese and
Overweight-Normal BMI categories as compared to Stayed
Normal. Outpatient expenditures were significantly higher for
Stayed Overweight, Stayed Obese, and Overweight-Normal
BMI categories as compared to Stayed Normal. Prescription
expenditures were significantly higher for all BMI change cat-
egories when compared to Stayed Normal. Compared to Stayed
Normal, medical provider expenditures were significantly lower
for Stayed Obese, but significantly higher for Overweight-
Normal. Statistically significant differences were not seen
between BMI change categories for in-patient expenditures.
Fully adjusted models of year 3 expenditures
Table 4, presents the results of OLS models on logged expen-
ditures from year 3 adjusted for gender, race, education, pov-
erty status, Medicaid status, insurance type, general health
including depression, smoking status, and baseline expendi-
tures. Adjusted models revealed those who Stayed Obese had
increased expenditures across multiple expenditure types that
were significantly higher than Stayed Normal including total
(11%), outpatient (25%), prescription (9%), and medical pro-
vider (4%). Individuals who Stayed Overweight had outpa-
tient expenditures that were significantly higher than Stayed
Normal (19%).

Among those who experienced weight gain, 
medical provider
expenditureswere4%higherforthoseintheNormal-Overweight
category and 8% higher for those in the Overweight-Obese
category. Total expenditures were 26% higher for those in the
Overweight-Obese category. Among those who experienced
weight loss, significant increases were seen only for those
belonging to the Obese-Overweight category. Compared to
Stayed Normal, individuals in the Obese-Overweight category
had higher expenditures for total (26%), outpatient (52%),

prescription (31%), and 
medical provider (7%).
Fully adjusted models of year 3 expenditures
by age stratification
Due to the increased risk of complications due to advanced
age, obesity treatments such as bariatric surgery require spe-
cial consideration for those over the age of 65. Therefore, we
conducted a secondary analysis (data not presented in tabular
form) on the effects of BMI change categories on health-care
expenditures stratified by age (65­74 years and 75+ years).
Among individuals 65­74 years, total expenditures were 18%
(P < 0.01) higher for Stayed Obese, 37% (P < 0.01) higher for
Overweight-Obese and 37% (P < 0.001) higher for Obese-
Overweight as compared to Stayed Normal. Results were not
statistically significant for individuals over 75 years of age.

Based on community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries over age 65, followed for
3 years with no missing BMI values and were first included in the survey between
2000 and 2003. BMI categories were defined as follows: normal weight (BMI
18.5­24.9kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25­29.9kg/m2), and obese (BMI 30kg/m2).
Poverty categories indicate greater than or less than 200% of the Federal Poverty

Discussion
We analyzed changes in health-care expenditures subsequent
to short-term weight changes and found that individuals who
Stayed Obese had higher total, outpatient, prescription, and
medical provider expenditures compared to those who Stayed
Normal. These findings are consistent with both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies that have established increased health-
care expenditures due to overweight and obesity (8,18,19).
More specifically, the short-term effect of weight gain on health
expenditures has been demonstrated in persons with diabetes.
For example, Yu and colleagues modeled changes in total and
diabetes-related health expenditures 1 year after weight gain/
loss and showed a 1% increase in weight would result in an
increase in total health costs of 3.1% (20).
We found that obesity in either year 1 or year 2 was signifi-
cantly associated with greater total expenditures. For example,
individuals who gained weight and moved from overweight
to obese BMI and those who lost weight from obese to over-
weight BMI had total expenditures that were 26% higher than
Stayed Normal. We also found that weight gain in terms of
moving from normal to overweight and weight loss in terms
of moving from overweight to normal did not produce higher
total expenditures. Taken together, these two findings suggest
that over a short period of time obesity can affect health-care
expenditures to a greater extent than weight loss or gain.
Our findings have to be interpreted in the context of a short
time horizon and reflect changes in health-care expenditures
with recent changes in BMI (for persons aged 65 years and
older). However, there is evidence that BMI assessed during
young adulthood and middle age is significantly and positively
associated with cardiovascular-related medical care charges
in older age (21). Thus, the lack of association between lower
expenditures and weight loss could be due to the fact that obese
individuals may have been obese for any number of years prior.
It is possible that accumulation of negative obesity-related fac-
tors contributed to their present medical state and thus higher
total expenditures, despite having lost weight.
Although total expenditures were significantly influenced
by weight change categories, in-patient expenditures were
not. One retrospective cross-sectional analysis by Shen et al.
(2009), analyzed the effect of BMI on health-care expenditures
among elderly veterans with diabetes. Results showed that
persons of normal weight had higher total, in-patient and out-
patient expenditures than those who were obese or morbidly
obese (22). Our study findings are also consistent with one
longitudinal study, which followed individuals over a period
of 7 years and concluded that the average weight reductions of
16% did not reduce hospitalization costs over a 6 year period
(23). It was concluded that the lag-time between reduction in
risk factors induced by weight loss and the resultant impact on
in-patient use is unknown. The authors also concluded that the
lag-time could be longer than 6 years. We were unable to deter-
mine the BMI of individuals over a longer period because the
MCBS followed Medicare beneficiaries for up to 3 years. We
could additionally, speculate that the lack of association could
be the result of excluding those who would likely be severely
ill (i.e., underweight individuals), and thus incur lengthy
hospital stays. It could also mean that over a short period,

hospitalizations are more sensitive to acute illness and disease
than to changes in weight.
A noteworthy finding from our study is the age differences
in the association between short-term changes in BMI catego-
ries and health-care expenditures. In our secondary analyses
discussed above, we did find that BMI change categories were
associated with greater total health-care expenditures among
persons 65­74 years of age. However, this relationship was not
significant for Medicare beneficiaries older than 75 years. These
findings suggest that weight loss or gain in advanced age may
not produce significant effects on health-care expenditures.
Our study's findings have to be interpreted in the context of
its limitations. We have analyzed short-term changes in health-
care expenditures and changing BMI categories in a nation-
ally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. We do
not know, however, whether these changes were intentional.
Average BMI has been shown to decline with advanced age (8).
In addition, we know that weight loss can accompany severe
illnesses, such as cancer. Although we have shown that health-
careexpenditureschangealongwithchangesinBMIcategories,
we cannot distinguish between healthy or unhealthy weight
changes. In addition, use of the BMI measurement for elderly
populations has been questioned. One longitudinal study on
aging reported that from age 30 to 70 years, men and women
lose an average of 3 and 5cm in height, respectively. By age 80,
loses were 5cm for men and 8cm for women (24). The study
also estimated that by age 70, BMI would be artificially raised
by 0.7kg/m2 in men and 1.6kg/m2 in women. At 80 years of
age this increase would be 1.4 and 2.6kg/m2 respectively. Age-
adjusted measures of body mass have been suggested. Andres
et al., proposed age-adjusted weight standards by which ideal
weight could be derived (25). Despite these findings, both the
World Health Organization and National Heart, Lung, Blood
Institute regard BMI as the index of choice to define weight
categories in all adults (26,27). Some studies suggest that indi-
viduals may have to be followed for >6 years for evidence of
the linkage between weight loss and reduced expenditures. We
were unable to determine the BMI of individuals over a longer
period because the MCBS followed Medicare beneficiaries for
up to 3 years. We also could not adequately control for endog-
eneity bias; weight loss is a natural process of aging and higher
medical expenditures may be driven by weight changes associ-
ated with progress and advanced stages of chronic diseases.
Despite limitations, our study has contributed to the discus-
sion of whether weight changes can offset increased expendi-
tures due to obesity. We have also described the relationship
between weight loss or gain and health-care expenditures over
the short-term by analyzing total and component expenditures.
In addition, whereas, some authors demonstrated this relation-
ship in terms of absolute pounds lost, or as relative percent-
ages, we define weight loss using the clinically relevant BMI
measure. Our study findings highlight that over a relatively
short period, having a stable weight results in lower health-
care expenditures when compared to both weight gain or loss.
Collectively, the findings of this study point to the importance
of maintaining a normal BMI over time.
