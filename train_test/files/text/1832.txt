Objectives: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a disturbance of vaginal mi-
croflora, is a common cause of vaginal symptoms and is associated with
an increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections,
HIV, and with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We determined preva-
lence and associations with BV among a representative sample of
women of reproductive age in the United States.
Study Design: Women aged 14­49 years participating in the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001­2004 were
asked to submit a self-collected vaginal swab for Gram staining. BV,
determined using Nugent's score, was defined as a score of 7­10.
Results: The prevalence of BV was 29.2% (95% confidence interval
27.2%­31.3%) corresponding to 21 million women with BV; only
15.7% of the women with BV reported vaginal symptoms. Prevalence
was 51.4% among non-Hispanic blacks, 31.9% among Mexican Amer-
icans, and 23.2% among non-Hispanic whites (P <0.01 for each com-
parison). Although BV was also associated with poverty (P <0.01),
smoking (P <0.05), increasing body mass index (2 P <0.0001 for
trend), and having had a female sex partner (P <0.005), in the mul-
tivariate model, BV only remained positively associated with race/
ethnicity, increasing lifetime sex partners (2 P <0.001 for trend),
increasing douching frequency (2 P for trend <0.001), low educa-
tional attainment (P <0.01), and inversely associated with current use
of oral contraceptive pills (P <0.005).
Conclusion: BV is a common condition; 84% of women with BV
did not report symptoms. Because BV increases the risk of acquiring
sexually transmitted infections, BV could contribute to racial dispar-
ities in these infections.
BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS (BV), A COMMON cause of vaginal
symptoms among reproductive-aged women,1 is characterized by
the loss of normal vaginal flora, predominantly hydrogen peroxide-
producing Lactobacillus spp., and the increase in the number and
species of other bacteria in vaginal fluid.2 The decrease in lacto-
bacilli and increase in numerous facultative and anaerobic bacteria,
some of which have only been recently characterized,2 may lead to
changes in the characteristics of vaginal fluid, such as thin dis-
charge and odor. However, many women with BV do not have
symptoms.
The diagnosis of BV can be made using clinical criteria3 or in
the laboratory by scoring bacterial morphotypes from a Gram stain
of vaginal fluid.4 A score of 0­3 is defined as normal, 4­6 as
intermediate, and 7­10 as BV.4 Treatment is recommended for
symptomatic women,5 but 1 month after therapy only 80% of
women have regained normal flora; recurrences after 1 month are
also common.5
The changes in vaginal microflora of BV are associated with
numerous health problems.2,5 BV increases the risk of acquiring
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),6 and among HIV in-
fected women, BV increases HIV viral shedding.7,8 BV increases
the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (STI)
such as gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and herpes simplex virus type
2 (HSV-2).9,10 In pregnant women, BV increases the risk of
miscarriage,11 preterm labor, preterm delivery, and postpartum
complications such as endometritis and wound infections.5,12,13
BV is not a reportable condition in the United States. We
provide an in-depth examination of symptomatology and risk
factors for BV using the 2001­2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods
Study Population and Study Design
NHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability
sample design with unequal probabilities of selection to obtain a
nationally representative sample of the US civilian noninstitution-
alized population.14 Certain subgroups of people, such as adoles-
cents, blacks, and Mexican Americans, are oversampled. All
women aged 14­49 years selected for NHANES 2001­2004 were
eligible for participation in this study. In 2001­2004 a total of 4646
women aged 14­49 years were interviewed, 4474 (96.3%) were
examined in the mobile examination center, 3961 completed an

additional private interview using an audio computerized self-
interview (ACASI), and 3739 (80.5% of total or 83.6% of those
examined) completed the examination and specimen collection.
Specimen Collection and Processing
Participating women were given oral and written instructions on
using a cotton-tipped swab to collect their vaginal fluid while in a
private bathroom. They were instructed to insert the swab at least
1 inch into the vagina, turn the swab against the walls of the vagina
while counting to 10, and then put the swab into the collection
tube. NHANES personnel applied the swab to narrow range pH
paper to determine pH and then rolled the swab onto a glass slide
to air dry. Slides were Gram stained and read using Nugent's
criteria3 at one central laboratory where readers were blind to any
information about the women. As part of quality control, 2.5% of
the BV samples were reread. There was 100% agreement between
the two readings. For our analysis, a Gram stain score of 7­10 was
defined as BV. We also analyzed the proportion of women with a
Gram stain score of 7­10 and a vaginal pH of 4.5. Women were
notified of their results by a password-protected call-in system
used for STI.
Demographic and Behavioral Data
Race and ethnicity were self-reported and classified as non-
Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American.
Women not reporting one of these categories were classified as
"other." Poverty index ratio was calculated by dividing total family
income by the poverty threshold index adjusted for family size at
year of interview.15 Assessment of educational attainment was
limited to those aged 18 and older. Population estimates were
generated by multiplying 2002 census estimates of civilian non-
institutionalized women aged 14­49 by the weighted prevalence
estimate. Symptom and behavioral data were self-reported. Having
sex was explained to participants as including vaginal, oral, or anal
sex. Using the ACASI, participants were asked "Have you ever
had sex?" The date of onset of the most recent menstrual cycle and
the date of the exam were used to calculate day of menstrual
cycle.16
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.1,
SAS Institute, Cary NC) and SAS callable SUDAAN (RTI, Re-
search triangle Park NC), and account for the complex survey
design by incorporating the survey weights and using a Taylor
series linearization to calculate variance estimates. The 2001­2004
medical examination survey weights provided by NHANES were
used to account for the unequal probabilities of selection and
adjustment for nonresponse. A prevalence estimate was considered
unreliable if the relative standard error was 30% of the preva-
lence estimate and those estimates are not presented. The sampling
design for 2001­2004 yields 30 degrees of freedom for variance
estimation and model building.
Confidence intervals were calculated using a log transformation
with the standard error of the log prevalence based on the delta
method and applying SUDAAN estimated standard errors.17 Sig-
nificance tests for associations between BV and other variables
were based on a Wald 2 statistic. A 0.05 level was used to define
statistical significance.
For the multivariate model we used SUDAAN for logistic
regression and considered all variables that had a P value of less
than or equal to 0.10 in bivariate analysis. Because of missing data
in the poverty index ratio, we used a variable with more complete
data: family income greater than or equal to $20,000 or below
$20,000. Using a backwards elimination approach, we removed
variables in order of least statistical significance. When all vari-
ables in the model were statistically significant at 0.05 level, all
pairwise interactions in the model were explored. When an inter-
action was entered into the model the main effects variables were
always retained. A pairwise interaction was retained only if the
overall P value for the interaction was 0.05.
Results
The prevalence of BV was 29.2% (95% confidence interval
27.2%­31.3%); corresponding to 21.4 million women with BV.
The proportion of women with a Nugent's score of 7­10 and a pH
4.5 was 22.3% (95% CI 20.7%­24.1%). In general, for the
variables mentioned below, prevalence of BV decreased by 25%
when we added the criterion of pH 4.5. The sensitivity and
specificity of pH 4.5 for detecting BV was 76.7% (95% CI
71.4%­81.1%) and 70.3% (95% CI 67.9%­72.7%).
BV prevalence varied significantly by sociodemographic char-
acteristics, earlier initiation of sexual activity, increasing numbers
of sex partners, and a previous female sex partner (Table 1). There
was a significant association between increasing numbers of life-
time sex partners and BV among non-Hispanic whites and non-
Hispanic blacks, but not among Mexican Americans (Fig. 1).
Women who reported more than one sex partner in the previous 12
months (recent) and more than one lifetime sex partner had a
prevalence of 39.6%, those who reported no or one recent sex
partner and more than one lifetime partner had a prevalence of
29.1%, those who reported no or one sex partner in the last 12
months and one lifetime partner had a prevalence of 22.4%, and
those who reported never having had sex had a prevalence of
18.8% (P  0.0001). Among the 163 women with BV who
reported never having had sex, 90% were aged 14­19 years, two
were infected with Chlamydia trachomatis, one with Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, and four had serologic evidence of previous in-
fection with HSV-2. Fifty-six women with BV who reported
never having had sex were married or cohabitating. After ex-
cluding women with another STD and those who were married
or cohabiting, prevalence among 14­19 year-old women was
18.5% (95% CI 13.5%­25.5%).
BV was also associated with having had a prior pregnancy,
being single, smoking, and having a high BMI; current oral con-
traceptive use was inversely associated with BV prevalence (Table
1). Current pregnancy or day in menstrual cycle was not associated
with BV prevalence.
BV prevalence varied by use of douches and other over-the-counter
feminine hygiene products (Table 2). Overall, 22.0% (95% CI
19.5%­24.9%) of women had douched in the previous 6 months.
Race/ethnicity, age, education, smoking status, income, poverty, num-
ber of lifetime sex partners, young age at first sex, BMI, and being
born in the United States were all significantly associated with douch-
ing. However, interactions between these variables and douching
were not significantly associated with BV prevalence.
BV prevalence did not vary by vaginal symptoms (Table 2);
13.9% (95% CI 12.7­15.1) of all women, 15.7% (95% CI 13.1­
18.8) of women with BV, and 13.2% (95% CI 11.8­14.6) of
women without BV reported vaginal symptoms in the previous
month (P  0.11). The prevalence of symptomatic BV was 4.4%.
Among women reporting vaginal symptoms the overall prevalence
of BV was 32% (95% CI 27.3­37.1). Among these women, those
who douched had a prevalence of 38% (95% CI 29.8­47.0) and
those who did not douche had a prevalence of 28.5% (95% CI
22.4­35.5). (P  0.11). Among women reporting no vaginal
symptoms the overall prevalence of BV was 27.7% (95% CI

25.5­29.9). Among these women, the prevalence of BV was
higher among those who douched, 46.4% (95% CI 42.3­50.5)
versus 23.1% (95% CI 20.9­25.4). (P 0.0001).
In the multivariate model, independent risk factors for BV were
race/ethnicity, frequency of douching, number of lifetime sex
partners, birth control pill use, and educational attainment (Table
3) . There were no significant interactions between these variables.
Discussion
We found the prevalence of BV among 14 to 49-year-old US
women to be 29.2%, similar to another estimate.18 This corre-
sponds to 21.7 million women with BV; however, most (84%)
reported no symptoms. The proportion of women with a Nugent's
score of 7­10 and a pH 4.5 was 22.3%, (corresponding to 16.6
million women), and the prevalence of symptomatic BV was 4.4%
(3.3 million women). Reported BV prevalence varies by clinical
setting, from 17% to 19% in family planning clinics to 24%­47%
in sexually transmitted disease clinics.1,3,10 The two largest studies,
both among women in urban prenatal care, used Gram stain and
pH criteria and found prevalences of 34.4% (n  15,864)19 and
18.5% (n  13,747).20 Our estimate is similar to results obtained
from a population of young women entering the military.21
We also found substantial differences in BV prevalence by race
(for non-Hispanic blacks prevalence 51%, OR 2.75, 95% CI 2.2­
3.5) and ethnicity (for Mexican Americans prevalence 32%,
OR1.60, 95% CI 1.3­2.1), compared with non-Hispanic whites
(prevalence 23%), after controlling for other risk factors.19,20,21
One study that controlled for an extensive list of behavioral and
demographic risk factors found that women reporting black race
had an OR of 2.2 (95% CI 15­31)22 for BV or intermediate flora.

PREVALENCE OF BV IN THE UNITED STATES, 2001­2004
40% (Table 1) and among non-Hispanic blacks before sexual
activity of 28.7% (Fig. 1) suggests that there may be other factors
contributing to BV in addition to sexual activity.
The role of sexual activity in the acquisition of BV is not clear.
We found the BV prevalence among women who never reported
having had sex was 18.8%. Some women with BV who reported
never having had sex had evidence of other STI or were married or
cohabiting. Therefore, some women may have misstated their
previous sexual activity or misinterpreted the question about sex-
ual activity. Nonetheless, many women with BV who did not
report sexual activity had no other evidence indicating they had
had sex. These data do not support a uniquely causal role of sexual
activity. Few studies have reported BV prevalence, incidence, or
risk factors conducted among women who have never been sexu-
ally active. Our estimate corresponds with the prevalence found
among sexually naïve young women entering the military, 18%.21
Another study among school girls who reported never having had
sex found a prevalence of 12%23 using the criteria of four of the
following five for the definition of BV: vaginal pH 4.5; abnormal
discharge; clue cells; positive sniff test; or succinate/lactate ratio
greater than or equal to 0.4 on gas-liquid chromatography of a
vaginal specimen. These first four criteria ("Amsel" criteria3) may
underestimate the prevalence of BV.24
In support of a role of sexual transmission, previous studies have
found that multiple or new sex partners increased the risk of
acquiring BV by a factor of 1.6­2.5.16,21,22,23,25 These studies also
suggested that condom use may be protective. In our study, BV
prevalence increased with number of lifetime sexual partners
among non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women (Fig.
1), and increased by a factor of 1.4­2.4 with increasing numbers
of sex partners in multivariate analysis. However, the NHANES
questionnaire did not assess recent sex act-specific condom use, so
we were unable to assess the relationship between recent condom
use and BV prevalence. Also supporting sexual transmission are data
from a study among lesbian couples; BV was associated with sharing
of sex toys, and couples had greater than 90% concordance in BV
status26 suggesting transmission of an infectious agent. We found that
women who had ever had sexual activity with another woman had a
higher prevalence of BV. Ongoing research into novel bacteria may
shed light on the cause and transmission of BV.2
Many previous studies16,22,25 have found that douching was
associated with higher BV prevalence by a factor of 1.4­2.1. We
found increasing douching frequency was independently associ-
ated with BV prevalence. However, because this was a cross-
sectional study, we could not evaluate the temporal relationship, if
any, of symptoms, the menstrual cycle, and douching to BV. Our
data showed no differences in BV prevalence among symptomatic
women on the basis of douching status; however, among asymp-
tomatic women, those who douched were more likely to have BV
than those who did not. The interpretation of this observation is
unclear. We could not capture the dynamic nature of BV; it may
appear and resolve spontaneously over days to weeks16. Of note,
prevalence did not vary significantly by timing in menstrual cycle
in this sample of women.
Although the cause of BV remains unclear, BV has been asso-
ciated with numerous adverse health outcomes, such as increased
vaginal HIV shedding.7,8,27 In prospective studies, BV increased
the risk of acquiring HIV by a factor of 2,6,9 HSV-2 by 2,10
gonorrhea by 1.7,9 and trichomoniasis by 1.8.9 Increased suscep-
tibility to these STI may be related to the decrease in protective
lactobacilli,9 the increase in abnormal flora,9 and the reduction in
vaginal secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.28 In our study, the
prevalence of BV among non-Hispanic black women was more
than twice that of non-Hispanic white women. This higher prev-
alence may in part contribute to higher prevalence of HIV, HSV,
trichomoniasis, and gonorrhea among non-Hispanic black women.
A recent trial has shown that treating asymptomatic women who
have BV with a suppressive treatment regimen reduced the inci-
dence of acquiring a new sexually transmitted infection (Jane
Schwebke, MD, personal communication).
The higher prevalence of BV among non-Hispanic black women
may also relate to racial disparities in the rate of preterm birth.29 In
this sample, women who had delivered a preterm and low-birth
weight infant had a higher prevalence of BV than either women
who had not had these pregnancy outcomes or had never been
pregnant. BV in pregnant women is associated with preterm birth
and other complications.5,13­15 In this sample, women who had
delivered a preterm and low birth weight infant had a higher
prevalence of BV than women who had not had these pregnancy
outcomes or had never been pregnant. Racial disparities in the rate
of preterm birth29 may be related to the higher prevalence of BV
among non-Hispanic black women. An intervention targeting BV-
related preterm birth may play a role in reducing these disparities.
This study provides additional information on the correlates of BV
prevalence. Most women were asymptomatic. Current methods for
diagnosing BV do not discriminate between possibly different
polymicrobial2 vaginal syndromes that could have different clinical
outcomes. Further research should clarify the cause of and risk factors
for BV, therapies that have high and long-lasting effectiveness, meth-
ods to identify those at risk, and methods to reduce associated adverse
health outcomes.
The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the
authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the agency.
