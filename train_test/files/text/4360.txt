During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Barack Obama's
prior voting record in the Illinois state senate came under
scrutiny in both the Democratic primary and the general
election. Opponents cited his record of voting "Present"
129 times--an unusual voting pattern permitted in Illinois
that allows a legislator to sidestep an issue without having to
vote Yea or Nay. This type of nonvoting behavior differs
from a simple abstention, in which one does not cast a vote at
all, though both abstentions and Present votes are forms of
legislative nonvoting behavior more generally. Criticisms of
Obama's qualifications to be president were articulated by
former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the 2008
Republican Convention:
And nearly 130 times, he couldn't make a decision. He couldn't
figure out whether to vote "yes" or "no." It was too tough. He
voted--he voted "present." I didn't know about this vote
"present" when I was mayor of New York City. Sarah Palin
didn't have this vote "present" when she was mayor or governor.
You don't get "present." It doesn't work in an executive job. For
president of the United States, it's not good enough to be present.
This article examines the use of the Present vote in the
91st to 93rd Illinois state senate, the three GeneralAssemblies
in which Obama served as a state senator prior to winning his
seat in the U.S. Senate. The Illinois state senate is of interest
not only because of Obama's prior service in the chamber but
also because the mechanisms that drive Present votes in
Illinois can be isolated in ways that are difficult to do in other
legislatures. This allows us to model this behavior in ways
that other studies of legislative nonvoting cannot. I focus on
answering three questions. First, why do Illinois state sena-
tors vote Present? Second, is our answer to the first question
consistent with the spatial theory of voting? Finally, if
Present votes are indeed consistent with the spatial model of
voting, do estimates of the ideological positions of the legis-
lators change when this information is incorporated into our
models?
My analysis of roll call data from the Illinois state senate
suggests several conclusions. Consistent with much of the
prior literature on nonvoting behavior in the U.S. Congress,
I find that Present votes frequently occur in systematic ways.
In particular, I find evidence that the majority of Present
votes are cast as a strategy by the minority party to protest
legislation that will pass irrespective of the preferences of
minority party members. This answer suggests that there is
information contained in Present votes that is consistent with
the spatial model of voting. Incorporation of this information
into models that estimate legislative preferences can enhance
the efficiency of estimates considerably, but does little to
change the rank ordering for most legislators in Illinois,
including Obama. In contrast to the implicit claim made by
Giuliani above, I find little evidence that by voting Present
on difficult votes, Obama appears more moderate under an

Voting Present: Obama and the Illinois
Senate 1999-2004

Abstract
During his time as a state senator in Illinois, Barack Obama voted "Present" 129 times, a deliberate act of nonvoting that
subsequently became an important campaign issue during the 2008 presidential elections. In this article, I examine the use of
Present votes in the Illinois state senate. I find evidence that Present votes can largely be characterized as protest votes used
as a legislative tool by the minority party. Incorporating information from Present votes into a Bayesian polytomous item-
response model, I find that this information increases the efficiency of ideal point estimates by approximately 35%. There is
little evidence of significant moderation by Obama when Present votes are accounted for, though my results suggest that
Obama's voting record may have moderated significantly before his subsequent election to the U.S. Senate. My results also
suggest that because legislative nonvoting may occur for a variety of reasons, naive inclusion of nonvoting behavior into vote
choice models may lead to biased results.

ideal point model than he otherwise would if such votes were
instead ignored.1
While my substantive focus is the Illinois state senate, my
results provide a framework for examining nonvoting mech-
anisms more broadly in other settings. I begin by identifying
a set of reasons why legislators choose not to vote. My
broader theoretical claim is that by distinguishing between
deliberate and idiosyncratic reasons to not vote, the deliber-
ate decision (i.e., voting Present) can be spatially informative
under certain circumstances. While I identify one such
example in Illinois, the use of Present votes is prominent in
other legislatures as well. Examples include the Czech,
Ecuadorian, and Brazilian legislatures, each of which had
Present vote rates of 6.1%, 11.6%, and 26.1% in recent years
(Rosas & Shomer, 2008). Furthermore, there is strong anec-
dotal evidence that Present votes may sometimes admit a
spatial interpretation. For example, Voeten (2001) has noted
that states in the United Nations Security Council effectively
vote Present on resolutions they do not approve of, allowing
legislation to pass without expressions of explicit support.2
My methodological approach to this problem builds pri-
marily on the work of Poole and Rosenthal (1997) and Rosas
and Shomer (2008). Specifically, I aim to explicitly incorpo-
rate data on Present votes into an ideal point estimator to
determine the validity of Giuliani's claim. Explicit modeling
of this nature is typically difficult because the prior literature
on nonvoting behavior identifies multiple reasons why legis-
lators may choose to not vote, and each of these reasons
admits a different spatial interpretation (Rosas, Shomer, &
Haptonstahl, 2010). Pooling nonvoting behavior generated
by different nonresponse mechanisms naively can therefore
lead to badly biased ideal point estimates, a key point
explored in this article. I address this problem in two ways.
First, note that Present votes are positive acts whereby a leg-
islator affirms their explicit decision not to vote. By examin-
ing only Present votes rather than pooling all forms of
nonvoting behavior together, I am able to separate cases
where legislators do not vote for idiosyncratic reasons (i.e.,
illness) from those where legislators deliberately choose not
to vote. The use of explicit nonvotes is similar to the strategy
used in Noury's (2004) study of Present-Not-Voting votes in
the European Parliament, but I build on this strategy by
explicitly incorporating such votes in an ideal point model.
Second, I show that one particular nonresponse mechanism
accounts for the vast majority of present votes in the Illinois
state senate.
For legislative scholars more broadly, these findings have
several implications. First, this study explicitly examines
ways that one might incorporate nonvoting explicitly in esti-
mates of spatial models of voting such as NOMINATE
(Poole & Rosenthal, 1985) and IDEAL (Clinton, Jackman, &
Rivers, 2004a). I argue that one can do so in cases where pat-
terns of nonvoting can be explicitly isolated to particular
mechanisms that admit a spatial interpretation. The Illinois
state senate is thus of interest because it presents an unusual
case where this is true, and I demonstrate substantial gains in
the efficiency of estimates when taking Present votes into
account. However, I also demonstrate that this will not gen-
erally be true, and also provide evidence of attenuation bias
that can occur if one naively attempts to do so in cases
whether the requirement to isolate particular nonvoting
mechanisms is not met. Second, I build on a growing litera-
ture that exploits chamber-specific procedures to draw infer-
ences about legislative behavior. For example, Kellerman
(2012) uses early day motions in the U.K. parliament to esti-
mate ideal points, while Proksch and Slapin (2012) use leg-
islative speech to identify intraparty preference divergence.
Much like these studies, I argue that chamber-specific proce-
dures can provide useful information to help estimate com-
ponents of the spatial model--in particular, I find that
estimates using Present votes are estimated with greater pre-
cision than those that ignore this data.
I begin this article with a discussion of the prior literature
about strategic nonvoting in legislative settings. While this
literature is not directly comparable with the act of voting
Present, it is useful in elucidating the key point that in most
cases there is little spatial information that can be extracted
from an analysis of pooled nonvotes alone, because legisla-
tors may choose to not vote for a wide variety of reasons. I
proceed by discussing a simple ideal point model that esti-
mates legislator preferences while accounting for the spatial
information from Present votes. However, it is important to
emphasize that this model is specifically tailored to the non-
response mechanism that drives Present voting in Illinois
and may not be suitable in other contexts. Next, I discuss my
analysis of roll call data in the Illinois state senate. I find
strong evidence that Present votes are best characterized as
coordinated protests against legislation that are organized by
the minority party. I conclude with a discussion of the sig-
nificance of these findings and possible directions for future
research.
Causes of Strategic Vote Avoidance
Although this article specifically focuses on Present votes,
the theoretical literature on Present votes is limited. However,
this review of the literature focuses on nonvoting more
broadly for two reasons. First, I attempt to identify a set of
theoretical reasons why legislators may choose to not to
vote, either implicitly or explicitly. This provides us with set
of observable implications that one can apply in testing
potential causal mechanisms underlying Present votes using
data from the Illinois state senate. A second reason to do so is
to contrast the mechanisms underyling vote avoidance more
generally to those underlying the specific decision to vote
Present. This comparison justifies my subsequent argument
that while it may be reasonable to treat Present votes as spa-
tially informative legislative choices in a spatial model of
voting, doing so with nonvoting behavior more generally
may be somewhat less reasonable.
Lo 3
Why do legislators not vote? In addition to obvious idio-
syncratic reasons (i.e., illness, other meetings, etc.), I iden-
tify five reasons cited in the literature as systematic reasons
why legislators may deliberately choose not to vote. These
reasons include indifference, alienation, competing princi-
pals, timing, and avoidance. In identifying these different
nonresponse mechanisms, I have two goals. First, I wish to
identify the observable implications of each nonresponse
mechanism to check the Illinois roll call data for the presence
or absence of the mechanism in question. Second, I wish to
show that legislators may have very different reasons for
abstaining, and these reasons each suggest different spatial
interpretations for a missing vote. Finally, I discuss protest as
a sixth potential mechanism that has previously been ignored
in the literature.
Nonvoting by indifference implies that legislators choose
not to vote when the utility they receive between voting for
the alternative and the status quo are very close. In practice,
this concept has largely been operationalized in the prior lit-
erature as vote marginality--on lopsided votes where the out-
come is certain, the probability of being a decisive vote is
low. In such cases, legislators will be indifferent to voting
because their vote is unlikely to affect the final outcome.3
This mechanism receives empirical support in Cohen and
Noll's (1991) analysis of a series of roll call votes on the
Clinch River nuclear reactor. Cohen and Noll found that leg-
islators voting on Clinch River were more likely to vote when
the vote was close and the outcome uncertain. Their finding
was subsequently generalized in the work of Poole and
Rosenthal (1997), who examine nonvoting rates systemati-
cally across all U.S. Congresses and find small vote margins
to be systematically related to lower rates of nonvoting.4 The
impact of vote margin on rates of nonvoting is disputed by
Rothenberg and Sanders' (1999) analysis of the 104th House,
but there is general consensus that the use of vote margin as
an operationalization of indifference is reasonable.5
Related to the principle of indifference, alienation sug-
gests that legislators choose to not vote when the alternative
and status quo both lie far from their most preferred policy
(Downs, 1957; Riker & Ordeshook, 1968). Rather than tak-
ing vote marginality as the principal determinant of nonvot-
ing, alienation suggests that legislators at the extremes of the
ideological distribution are most likely to abstain because all
options presented to them are highly undesirable. While I am
unable to find any direct tests of the alienation hypothesis in
the literature on ideal point estimation, a related article that
points to its plausibility is Carroll, Lewis, Lo, Poole, and
Rosenthal (2013), who find evidence that normal utility
functions in ideal point models fit roll call data better than
quadratic utility functions in a wide variety of legislative
contexts.6 This has important implications for the possibility
of alienation because as alternatives move far away into the
tails of the normal distribution, utility differences shrink,
while the same shift under quadratic utility would lead to
greater utility differences. Stated differently, quadratic utility
is inconsistent with alienation because utility differences
increase when alternatives are moved far from a legislator's
ideal point.
Under the competing principals arguments articulated by
Carey (2007), legislators must balance concerns from multi-
ple party constituencies that exert control over their political
future. In their analysis of voting behavior in Argentina's
province-centric system, Jones and Hwang (2005) argue that
certain bills place legislators in a competing principals
dilemma across party factions. While the national leadership
maintains control of the party agenda, provincial leaders
exert tremendous influence over the careers and electoral
prospects of their provincial delegation. This leads to situa-
tions where legislators are forced to choose between the
national party position and the position of the provincial del-
egation--under these circumstances, legislators may choose
to abstain to ensure that their vote is not counted against the
party's majority. Evidence for the competing principals
hypothesis can be seen in the work of Rosas and Shomer
(2008), who estimate an ideal point model in which nonvotes
are recoded as minority votes in Argentina's Federal
Congress. Using the deviance information criteria (DIC) as
their fit statistic, they find that a model treating nonvotes as
minority votes achieves a DIC of 0.25 compared with a DIC
of 0.12 for a model treating nonvoting as ignorable.
Similar to the competing principals hypothesis, Jones
(2003) argues that legislators seek to avoid difficult votes.7
In contrast to the competing principals hypothesis where
issues divide party members internally, Jones focuses on the
impact of difficult votes on future electoral success. More
specifically, Jones finds that senators in districts with greater
ideological diversity in their constituency are more likely to
avoid taking positions--the implication is that position tak-
ing leads to electoral vulnerability. However, two additional
findings cast some doubt on the idea that position taking
makes legislators more vulnerable. First, Jones also finds
that the senators with the largest margin of victory are in fact
much more likely to avoid taking a position--in fact, those
with the largest margin of victory are 83.7% more likely to
avoid votes than those with the lowest margin.8 Second,
Rothenberg and Sanders (1999) find that legislators standing
for reelection vote more frequently than those who are retir-
ing. The implication of these contrary findings is that casting
roll call votes may actually help, rather than hinder those
seeking reelection.
Previous work on nonvoting has also identified the sched-
uling of votes as a potential factor influencing the propensity
of legislators to vote. In particular, Rothenberg and Sanders
(2000) argue that because legislators need to campaign in
their home constituency, the time and date that a vote is
scheduled can have an effect on the associated cost of voting.
Rothenberg and Sanders found that nonvoting was more fre-
quent on votes scheduled at the end of a session rather than at
the beginning, reflecting the fact that many legislators need to
campaign for reelection at the end of the legislative session.
4 SAGE Open
Furthermore, votes scheduled in the middle of the week
have higher attendance than those scheduled on Monday or
Friday, reflecting the desire of legislators to spend weekends
in their home districts. While this pattern is highly robust,
there is no obvious spatial interpretation for this behavior as
moderates and extremists alike will both abstain together for
this reason.
In a preview of my results, I discuss a sixth mechanism
that does not appear in my review of the literature on nonvot-
ing. The decision not to vote may in fact represent an alterna-
tive means of protesting legislation. This is similar to the
avoidance mechanism of Jones (2003), in the sense that leg-
islators torn by competing constituency interests are pro-
tected from casting controversial votes. It differs from Jones
in that those who unambiguously oppose a piece of legisla-
tion may choose to pool with those who are less certain. I
argue that this mechanism best characterizes the majority of
Present votes in the Illinois state senate.9 Furthermore, this
mechanism appears to occur at least occasionally in other
legislatures as well, particularly in legislatures that stipulate
quorum requirements. One notable example was an attempt
by Republicans to stall consideration of campaign finance
legislation in 1988 by exiting the Senate floor together so
that a quorum could not be achieved. In effect, Republican
senators abstained from consideration of the legislation in a
coordinated effort. The issue came to the national spotlight
when then-Senate majority leader Robert Byrd (D-WV)
offered and passed a motion ordering the Sergeant-at-Arms
to arrest and escort absent senators to the floor so that a quo-
rum could be reached.
Estimation
In this section, I propose a model that allows us to examine
the impact of Present votes on legislator ideal points. Ideal
point models in political science have contributed much to
our understanding of legislative voting patterns. Building on
the spatial theory of voting (Downs, 1957; Enelow & Hinich,
1984), these models posit that legislator ideal points can
each be represented on a unidimensional or multidimen-
sional space. Each vote is associated with a Yea and Nay
location in the same space. Utilities from a Yea or Nay vote
on each roll call for each legislator can then be calculated
through the use of some utility function and a measure of
distance between the legislator's bliss point and the bill
locations. Legislators are then assumed to maximize utility
given a random utility model with some random shock
(McFadden, 1973). Scaling software is concerned with the
estimation of these legislator and bill locations from roll call
data, and popular static implementations of these procedures
include NOMINATE (Poole & Rosenthal, 1985), Heckman-
Snyder scores (Heckman & Snyder, 1997), and IDEAL
(Clinton et al., 2004a).
It is well known in ideal point literature that the spatial
model of voting with two alternatives and quadratic utility is
simply a reparameterization of the traditional two-parameter
item-response model that is prominent in the educational
psychology literature (Clinton et al., 2004a). In this section,
I extend this finding to show that the same relationship also
holds true for the spatial model of voting with multiple alter-
natives and the polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT)
model (Andrich, 1978; Rasch, 1961) that is frequently used
to analyze Likert scales.10 This model allows us to model
Present votes under limited conditions that are discussed
later.
Let p denote the number of legislators (i = 1, . . . , p) and
q denote the number of roll call votes (j = 1,. . . , q). Each roll
call allows a set of at least r=2 choices, and k denotes the
choice (k = 1,. . . , r). In traditional ideal point models, the
r = 2 choices that are permitted are Yea and Nay votes--this
model, however, allows r to exceed two choices. Drawing on
the spatial model of voting, there are three parameters of
theoretical interest. The key parameter is each legislator i's
ideal point, denoted as xi . In the same space, each choice k
for each roll call j is located at  jk . Furthermore, each choice
carries a valence parameter,  jk , which measures the utility
a legislator receives from selecting that choice independent
of ideological concerns (Londregan, 1999).11 I assume a qua-
dratic utility function for legislators. Following the random
utility framework of McFadden (1973), legislator i's utility
on roll call j from outcome k is:
U u
ijy ijk ijk
= +  , (1)
where uijk represents the deterministic component of legis-
lator utility, and ijk represents the stochastic component.
ijk is assumed to follow a Type 1 extreme value distribu-
tion. The deterministic component of utility is composed of a
roll call valence utility  jk and a spatial component that
declines as a quadratic function of the distance between the
legislator i's ideal point and the location of outcome location
 jk . One can further express the deterministic component of
utility as follows:
u x x x
ijk jk i jk i jk jk i
= - - = - + +
   
( ) ,
2 2
(2)
where   
jk jk jk
= - 2
and  
jk jk
= 2 2 .
Decomposition of utility into these components simplifies
the estimation of the desired parameters. Following Dhrymes
(1978), this allows us to express the probability that legisla-
tor i votes for outcome m = k on roll call j as:

This is identical to the probability of choice under a poly-

In the form written above, the choice equation is unidenti-
fied. To facilitate model identification, I constrain  jk and
 jk to equal 0 for the first outcome of all bills and orient the
polarity of the recovered estimates by placing Democrats to
the left and Republicans to the right of the scale. Following
Poole and Rosenthal (1997), I also discard any bills in which
the losing side has less than 2.5% of the vote from analysis
because these bills are typically driven by noise rather than
spatial considerations. Finally, estimation is conducted using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo by simulating the posterior:
p X V p V X p X
( , , | ) ( | , , ) ( , , ),
     
 (5)
where priors are normally distributed and diffuse for all
parameters. The derivation presented here therefore shows
that the polytomous IRT model can be interpreted as a spatial
model of voting with more than one choice and valence
considerations.
At this point, it is helpful to compare this model with one
that is similar in spirit to the one presented here. Rosas and
Shomer (2008) also model nonvoting explicitly in an item-
response model, albeit under very different modeling assump-
tions. Specifically, Rosas and Shomer treat the propensity to
not vote as a second dimension, whereas this model treats
present votes as informative on the primary left-right dimen-
sion.12 Both approaches have merit depending on the nonre-
sponse process that is prevalent, but I provide justification for
the reasonableness of the model assumptions in the Illinois
senate when examining the data. However, the Rosas and
Shomer assumptions will be reasonable in many legislative
settings where these assumptions are not justified.
I test this model via Monte Carlo simulation. Using the
data generating mechanism shown here, I generated a set
of ideal point and bill parameters for p = 100 legislators,
q = 500 roll call votes, and r = 4 choices for each roll call. I
then use these parameters to generate a roll call matrix and
attempt to recover the true ideal points using the estimator.
The estimated ideal points x
i
correlate with the true ideal
points at r = .998, suggesting that the estimator successfully
recovers ideal points generated under this model.
While this test shows correct recovery of the latent trait of
interest under simulated conditions, it does not mean that the
assumptions underlying this model will always be reasonable
for modeling nonvoting. In fact, in most cases, this estimator
will yield highly biased estimates. Consider the effect of non-
voting by indifference on my estimates.13 This theory sug-
gests that the propensity of legislators to not vote is low when
outcomes are highly certain, since their chance of being the
pivotal legislator is high. However, when outcomes are cer-
tain, legislators who are both liberal and conservative are less
likely to vote--in other words, there is no spatial interpreta-
tion for nonvoting by indifference. By imposing a spatial
interpretation to nonvoting in a situation where no such inter-
pretation exists, the model will place the location of the non-
voting alternative near the middle of the ideological space,
since this location will minimize utility differences if legisla-
tors on both sides of the aisle are choosing it.14 The estimated
positions of legislators who abstain frequently with others
will attenuate to the middle of this distribution. This problem
becomes even more severe when nonvoting behavior occur-
ring through other nonresponse mechanisms are pooled
together with those caused by voting indifference.
In fact, this is exactly what occurs if one applies this
model to estimate ideal points using roll calls from the 109th
U.S. House. Figure 1 plots ideal points estimated under two
assumptions, the standard model where nonvotes are ignored
and the polytomous IRT model treating nonvotes as a third
choice. Not surprisingly, the estimates match up very closely
for the vast majority of legislators shown in gray. However,
estimates recovered for legislators who abstained more than
100 times are highlighted and are consistent with the
Figure 1. Ideal point estimates, 109th House: x-axis plots ideal
points recovered when treating non-votes as missing, while y-axis
plots the same ideal points under the assumption that nonvoting
is spatially informative. Dotted line is a 45° line, and dark points
represent estimates for legislators that abstained more than
100 times. In all cases, the estimated ideal point under the
assumption that nonvoting is spatially informative is more moderate
for frequent abstainers. This suggests that nonvotes occur for
multiple reasons, invalidating a simple spatial interpretation for
them in this particular application. The circled outlier on the right
is president George W. Bush, and the circled outlier on the right is
John Lewis (D-GA).

expectations outlined earlier. In all 13 cases, the ideal point
estimated under the assumption that abstentions can be mod-
eled as separate locations is more moderate than the one
recovered under the assumption that nonvotes are ignorable.
Two cases in the 109th House that are circled in Figure 1
highlight the dangers of pooling multiple causes of nonvot-
ing together. On the right of Figure 1, one can see an outlier
that represents the estimate of president George W. Bush's
ideal point, estimated using his administration's expressed
preferences on legislation from the House.15 Bush's ideal
point under the assumption of ignorable nonvoting lies
slightly to the right of the Republican median, an estimate
that is largely in line with other accounts.16 However, because
Bush does not express opinions on most pieces of House leg-
islation, his nonvoting count is extremely high. This causes
his estimated ideal point to attenuate all the way to zero when
nonvotes are modeled as separate locations. At this location,
Bush lies far to the left of even the most liberal Republican
Congressman, an estimate that is substantively implausible.
Distorted estimates of presidential ideal points are not
surprising because presidents do not actually vote in the
House. Nevertheless, similar results also appear for regular
House members as well. One such case is John Lewis
(D-GA), who is the frequent abstainer shown on the far left
of Figure 1. Under the standard model where nonvoting is
ignored, Lewis's ideal point is estimated to be -1.65, ranking
him as the 7th most liberal member of the House. In contrast,
his ideal point under the model where nonvoting is informa-
tive places him at -1.12, ranking him as the 108th most lib-
eral member of the House and slightly to the right of the
median Democrat.17 However, there is substantial evidence
that the first estimate is more accurate--Lewis is an outspo-
ken civil rights leader, and cites outspoken Florida liberal
and New Deal supporter Claude Pepper as the political col-
league that he admires most. Furthermore, there appears to
be little evidence of electoral pressure to moderate, as Lewis
has run unopposed since 2002. Finally, other ideal point esti-
mates are consistent with the more liberal estimate as well--
Poole's Optimal Classification technique (2000), which
estimates legislator locations nonparametrically, places
Lewis as the 11th most liberal member of the U.S. House of
Representatives.18
Summarizing the discussion to this point, my review of
the literature identified six mechanisms under which strate-
gic vote avoidance might occur. In this section, I propose
using the polytomous IRT model to study strategic vote
avoidance further, and justify its use by demonstrating that it
can be reparameterized as an ideal point model with qua-
dratic utility and more than two choices. However, I also
argue that because different mechanisms under which legis-
lators might strategically abstain imply very different spatial
interpretations, treating them as informative in a polytomous
IRT model is generally not appropriate. In most cases, doing
so will significantly moderate the ideal point estimates of
legislators who abstain frequently--in one instance,
changing the rank ordering of a legislator from the 7th to
108th most liberal member of the 109th U.S. House.
Present Votes in the 91st-93rd Illinois
State Senate
In this section, I examine the uses of Present votes in the
91st-93rd Illinois State Senate, which covers most of the
period that Obama served as a State Senator. Although
Obama also served in the 90th senate, voting records for this
period were difficult to access and are omitted from this
study.19 All voting data were obtained from the Illinois state
legislature website at http://www.ilga.gov. The Illinois State
Senate is comprised of 59 members, and was controlled by
Republicans during the 91st and 92nd Senate before chang-
ing control to the Democrats in the 93rd. There is no superma-
jority required for legislation to pass, and the filibuster does
not exist. In addition to standard Yea/Nay votes, the Illinois
Senate allows members to vote "Present" on any legislation.
Present votes are distinguished in the record from missing
votes, where the senator is not available to vote, so they are
unusual in that they indicate a deliberate decision not to vote
Yea or Nay. However, Present Votes are not inconsequential
because the Illinois Senate stipulates that all bills require the
assent of an absolute majority of the chamber (i.e., 30 votes),
rather than a simple plurality (i.e., more Yea than Nay votes).
Present votes therefore have the same legislative effect as a
No vote.
The decision to study Present votes rather than nonvoting
more generally thus immediately addresses two issues raised
earlier in my review of the literature. As deliberate acts of
nonvoting, Present votes largely eliminate the set of cases
where nonvoting occurs due to idiosyncratic reasons such as
illness from consideration.20 Present voting also eliminates
the impact of vote scheduling--while Rothenberg and
Sanders (2000) argue that legislators frequently abstain dur-
ing periods when they spend time in their home constituency
campaigning, these occasions would not be recorded as
Present votes because such votes require the legislator to be
on the Senate floor when the vote is cast.
Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics about general
voting patterns in the Illinois Senate. These descriptive sta-
tistics illustrate two important characteristics of the data.
First, many more roll calls were introduced in the 93rd
Senate after the Democratic takeover, a point that is impor-
tant to emphasize here because it affects the comparability of
the graphics that are presented later. The 93rd Senate not
only saw more roll calls, but the vast majority of those roll
calls were also nonlopsided roll calls in which the losing side
had more than 2.5% of the vote. Lopsided roll calls are typi-
cally uninteresting in the sense that they convey no spatial
information, so the remainder of this analysis focuses solely
on nonlopsided roll calls. Second, Present votes appear with
some frequency in the data. Approximately 40% of all non-
lopsided roll calls have at least one person voting Present,
Lo 7
and 3.2% to 6.3% of all votes were Present votes. The key
point here is that Present votes occur in sufficient frequency
that they could, under certain situations, affect ideal point
point estimates in a substantively significant manner.
Since Present votes have the same legislative effect as a
No vote, the competing principals hypothesis suggests that
senators might vote Present to kill legislation without having
to cast a No vote directly (Forgette & Sala, 1999). Table 2
examines the evidence for competing principals by tabulat-
ing failed and successful roll call votes, and four key points
emerge from this analysis. First, the vast majority of roll calls
pass, consistent with expectations of strong party discipline
(Cox & McCubbins, 2005). Second, I find little evidence in
support of the hypothesis that Present votes are used to kill
legislation. In examining the legislative impact of voting
Present, I define a "Pivotal Present Vote" as a bill that fails to
pass, but which would have passed if all senators voting
Present had switched their vote to Yea. Pivotal Present votes
thus define the set of roll calls where Present votes poten-
tially "matter" in defeating a piece of legislation. Only 18
roll calls were Pivotal Present votes, which suggest that vot-
ing Present was generally an ineffective tactic at killing leg-
islation. Third, I tabulate the total number of Present votes by
Obama on nonlopsided legislation, which total 55 Present
votes across all three Senates. Note that this figure is differ-
ent from the 129 total Present votes attributed to Obama, as
74 of those Present votes occurred either in the 90th Senate
or on legislation passing by lopsided margins.21 Finally,
Table 2 also shows how Obama's frequency of voting Present
ranked in the legislature. During the two Republican-
controlled senates, Obama's frequency of voting Present
ranked him in the upper tertile, while his frequency dropped
to the median during the Democrat-controlled 93rd senate.
Table 3 continues this analysis by examining the 18
Pivotal Present votes in greater detail. With the potential
exception of SB1704 (Pension Code Reform) and SB1963
(Consumer Protection Agency Act), none of the pivotal votes
could be described as major pieces of legislation.22 Present
votes therefore rarely appear to be decisive on major legisla-
tion. Of the 18 pivotal outcomes, Obama voted Present on
five of those occasions, yet even on these five occasions the
legislative impact of his Present votes appears to be minimal.
Obama's Present votes in the 92nd state senate occurred
on two pieces of legislation where large numbers of senators
(22 and 30 senators, respectively) joined him. In the 93rd
state senate, Obama voted Present on Election Code and
Pension Code reform bills that narrowly failed, but the mean-
ing of his votes here are unclear because they were votes
against concurring with a House Amendment to a bill (typi-
cally a conference report), rather than a vote against the bill
at third reading. The change to the Riverboat Gambling Act
appears to be the sole example of a piece of legislation where
Obama's Present vote clearly mattered, yet this appears to
have been a fairly minor piece of legislation.
A second version of the competing principals hypothesis
suggests that senators might vote Present as an indirect way
to oppose their party. If this is true, senators are likely to vote
Present on party line roll calls that are supported by their
party. I define a party line roll call as one where a majority of
Democrats vote differently from a majority of Republicans,
with Present votes excluded from the counts. Table 4 sum-
marizes Obama's voting patterns on party line votes, show-
ing large differences in voting behavior between senates.
Party line voting surged in Obama's final term, jumping from
34 party line votes in the Republican-controlled 91st and
92nd Senate to 535 party line votes in the Democrat-
controlled 93rd Senate. This increase was partly driven by
the increase in total legislation in the 93rd, but even account-
ing for the volume of legislation the 93rd Senate was much
more divided along partisan lines--38% of all roll calls in
the 93rd Senate were party line votes, compared with only
8% before that. Across all three legislatures, Obama largely
voted along party lines, siding with Democrats 92% of the
time. Notably, although there were no instances where
Obama voted Present on party line roll calls supported by
Democrats in either the 91st or 92nd Senate, this occurred 16

times in the 93rd Senate. There is therefore some evidence
that Obama used Present votes to indirectly oppose his party
while the Democrats controlled the Senate.
Nonvoting by indifference suggests that voting is most
likely to occur when the probability of affecting the final out-
come is high. If this is true, then Present votes likely to occur
when the Yea and Nay sides are closely matched on a vote.
Figure 2 examines the evidence for this claim by plotting the
Yea­Nay margin on each roll call against the number of
Present votes on each roll call, with Obama's Present votes
highlighted as darker points. While there are few votes that
are close (i.e., have a Yea­Nay margin near 0), there is no
evidence in any Congress that close votes are more likely to
have large numbers of senators voting Present. Instead,
Present votes occur most frequently when the Yea­Nay mar-
gin is around 35 votes. This trend is consistent with Obama's
pattern of voting Present in the 91st and 92nd Senate--
Obama largely votes Present only when a large number of
other senators are voting likewise. However, Obama's pro-
pensity to vote Present in the 93rd Senate seems largely
random.
Although the previous graphic suggests that senators who
vote Present frequently do so together, it provides little infor-
mation about who votes Present together. To examine this
issue, I first estimate ideal points for each Senate under the
traditional assumption that Present votes are missing data.

Figure 3 plots histograms of Present vote frequency by ideal
point estimate. The histograms suggest that Present votes
were largely used by the minority party--Democrats were
particularly likely to use them in the 91st and 92nd Senate,
while Republicans were likely to use them in the 93rd. Figure 3
also examines the evidence for the nonvoting by alienation
mechanism. If alienation accounts for a significant portion of
Present votes, one would expect to see large numbers of
Present votes at the two extremes of the ideal point distribu-
tion. However, this does not appear to be the case. Finally,
Figure 3 provides justification for the modeling assumption
that Present votes are partially informative on the left-right
dimension, since the majority of Present votes occurs along
partisan lines.
I also examine the evidence for Jones' (2003) hypothesis
that legislators seek to avoid position taking because votes
are regularly cited against them in campaigns. This finding
was disputed by Rothenberg and Sanders (1999), who instead
argue that voting aids electoral success. I find little evidence
that position avoidance helps reelection, as the 11 Republican
senators who lost their seat between the 92nd and 93rd
Senate averaged 3.73 Present votes compared with 3.85
Present votes for the entire Republican caucus. Electoral vul-
nerability therefore does not appear to explain the frequency
of Present votes.23
After rejecting alienation, indifference, electoral vulnera-
bility, vote timing, and competing principals as explanations
of Present votes, one is left with the conclusion that such
votes are best interpreted as minority votes against legisla-
tion. Under such a mechanism, Present votes are spatially
informative and can therefore be incorporated into models of
ideal point estimation. Ideal point models traditionally treat
Present votes as missing data. However, Present votes occur
with moderate frequency and in a nonrandom manner. I
therefore estimate ideal point models that incorporate Present
votes in two ways. First, I estimate a model that treats Present
votes as a third choice on each vote. I also estimate another
model where Present votes are treated as No votes, a model
motivated by the fact that Present and No votes have the
same legislative effect. Ideal points estimated under these
assumptions are then plotted against ideal points estimated
under the traditional assumption of Present votes as missing

data in Figure 4. Obama's specific ideal point estimates
under different assumptions are presented in Table 5. The
relationships are strongly linear, showing little variability in
the recovered ideal point estimates regardless of the model
estimated.
Notably, Obama was criticized during the campaign for
voting Present to appear moderate, yet there is little evidence
of moderation in his ideal point estimates under either model
of informative nonvoting presented in Table 5. The largest
shift that is observed occurs in the 92nd state senate, where
Obama is ranked as the 7th most liberal Illinois senator under
the traditional model and the 10th most liberal when Present
votes are considered as a separate choice. Note that a large
shift in rank order is entirely possible--under the nonvoting-
as-location model, John Lewis's (D-GA) estimated ideal
point changed his ranking from the 7th most liberal member
of the House of Representatives to the 108th. No shift of any
comparable magnitude occurs here. However, there is some
evidence that suggests Obama may have become more mod-
erate in the 93rd state senate, as his ideal point and ranking
both moderate considerably. However, the evidence is still
inconclusive because estimates across legislatures are not
comparably--inparticular,becausethe93rdhasaDemocratic
majority there are significantly more Democratic senator.24
Furthermore, there is some possibility of vote selection
effects that may arise as candidates campaign for higher
office (Clinton, Jackman, & Rivers, 2004b).
While rank orderings largely remain unchanged when
Present votes are incorporated into the model, the model
Lo 11
obtains significant improvements in the efficiency of the
estimates. Taking the 91st Senate as an example, Democrats
had a mean standard error of 0.19 in the traditional model
where Present votes are omitted. However, this drops to 0.13
in the model where Presents are counted as No votes, and
0.12 in the case where Presents are counted as a third loca-
tion. However, the increase in efficiency is marginal for
Republicans, who have a mean standard error of 0.16 under
the traditional model, but mean standard errors of 0.14 and
0.15, respectively, under the models where Present votes are
treated as no or separate votes, respectively. An obvious
hypothesis explaining this discrepancy is the large number of
Present votes cast by the minority party--this hypothesis
receives strong support from the fact that the pattern is
reversed in the 93rd Senate under a Democratic majority
when Republican legislators vote Present much more
frequently.
Summarizing the results presented here, the practice of
voting Present largely appears to be a tactic employed by the
minority party. When Present voting occurs, it is rarely deci-
sive in the sense that the outcome of the vote would have
changed regardless of how those who voted Present would
otherwise have voted. In the few cases where Present votes
are potentially decisive, the affected legislation is generally
minor. Present votes also do not appear to occur for particu-
larly controversial legislation where the Yea minus Nay mar-
gin is small--in fact, they are most likely to occur when the
margin is about 30 votes.
Obama's usage of Present votes was largely consistent
with these patterns--his use of Present votes was in the
upper tertile of legislators, but was not particularly unusual.
The majority of Obama's Present votes occurred on roll calls
where large numbers of Democrats voted Present with him,
particularly in the 91st and 92nd state senate. There is little
evidence that Obama was more likely to vote Present when
Present votes were potentially decisive, and little evidence
that Obama was more likely to vote Present when votes were
controversial. Some evidence suggests that Obama used
Present votes to oppose his party on party line votes during
the 93rd senate, but these votes were rarely decisive and had
little impact on estimates of his ideal point. Notably, the
incorporation of information from Present votes does not
make Obama's estimated ideal point more moderate. Obama
consistently appears as the 5th or 6th most liberal member of
the Illinois state senate in the 91st General Assembly, but he
becomes the 23rd or 24th most liberal senator by the 93rd as
he begins his campaign for the U.S. Senate.
Conclusion
In this article, I examine the use of Present votes in the
Illinois state senate. I find that Present votes are best charac-
terized as coordinated protest votes by minority party mem-
bers against the majority. Since these votes produce cutlines
that are consistent with the spatial model of voting, their
inclusion into ideal point models is justifiable. These condi-
tions are not true of nonvoting in legislatures such as the
109th House, which occurs for a wide variety of reasons with
different spatial interpretations. Under these circumstances,
the ideal point estimates of legislators who do not vote will
frequently be greatly attenuated. These results thus suggest
that because nonvoting more generally may occur for a vari-
ety of reasons, naive inclusion of nonvoting into vote choice
models may lead to biased results. However, in contrast to
the 109th House I find no significant attenuation of ideal
point estimates when accounting for Present votes, and the
efficiency of estimates improves by approximately 35% after
information from Present votes is incorporated into the
model. Furthermore, I find little evidence of significant mod-
eration by Obama when Present votes are accounted for,
though there is some evidence that Obama's voting record
moderated significantly before his subsequent election to the
U.S. Senate.
In examining directions for future research, it is important
to first compare and contrast this contribution to that of ear-
lier work on this subject. Early work on nonvoting (Cohen &
Noll, 1991; Poole & Rosenthal, 1997; Rothenberg & Sanders,
1999) examined rates of nonvoting, identifying multiple rea-
sons why legislators might strategically avoid votes.
However, these studies are limited by the fact that different
nonresponse mechanisms each imply different spatial inter-
pretations. In the context of this article, a central contribution
of this earlier literature is to emphasize what should not be
done--namely, pooling multiple sources of nonvoting into
an ideal point model naively in models similar to what was
shown earlier for the 109th House. Jones (2003) suggests
that one solution to this problem is to examine only cases
where legislators avoid taking positions, thereby eliminating
idiosyncratic reasons for nonvoting from consideration. This
approach facilitates a richer analysis of vote avoidance than
is otherwise possible, but still does not completely address
the pooling problem identified earlier in situations where one
wishes to incorporate such information into an ideal point
model.
My approach to the study of Present votes instead is simi-
lar to the working paper by Rosas et al. (2010), who attempt
to determine the conditions under which nonvoting is ignor-
able in roll call data analysis. Rosas et al. propose three vari-
ants of the IRT model designed to incorporate information
from nonvotes under the mechanisms of indifference, alien-
ation, and competing principals, and they demonstrate that
legislator ideal points can be recovered with greater accuracy
under two of the three models via Monte Carlo simulation. A
central theme of their paper is that vote avoidance can often
usefully be incorporated into ideal point models if the nonre-
sponse mechanism can be isolated and modeled.
Similar to Rosas et al. (2010), I begin by identifying a
nonresponse mechanism and developing an ideal point
model to capture the dynamics of nonresponse. However, I
build upon this model in significant ways, first by showing
12 SAGE Open
the relationship between the polytomous IRT model and a
multiple choice spatial model of voting, and also in showing
the attenuation bias that can occur when nonresponses result-
ing from different processes pool together. I then identify the
Illinois legislature as a case where a single nonresponse
mechanism appears to be particularly dominant in explaining
deliberate acts of nonvoting. This situation is especially
intriguing in light of its relevance to the 2008 U.S. presiden-
tial campaign. In contrast to claims that suggest otherwise, I
find little evidence that Present votes moderate estimates of
Obama's estimated ideal point in any way, but incorporation
of such votes improves the efficiency of estimates
considerably.
Moving forward, substantive applications of nonvoting
models to real legislatures is clearly an important and worth-
while endeavor, especially in light of Rosas et al.'s (2010)
claim that such mechanisms are not ignorable. Such applica-
tions are difficult to address in light of the pooling problems
discussed earlier. This research suggests that one way to
approach this problem is through cleaner identification,
whereby nonvoting behavior driven largely by a single non-
response mechanism can be isolated. This can be done not
only through careful selection of the legislature to be ana-
lyzed but can also potentially be accomplished by subsetting
particular votes or legislators. Careful selection of cases can
therefore permit theoretical expectations of nonresponse to
become more closely aligned with what is observed.

Notes
1. This does not rule out the possibility that the use of Present
votes made Obama appear more moderate to voters. However,
this article instead focuses on the legislative consequences of
Present votes, and I leave discussion of electoral consequences
for future research.
 2. In the United States, I am not aware of any other legislatures
that permit deliberate nonvoting other than Illinois. A partial
exception are "pairings" in the U.S. Congress, in which they
identify a Member absent during a vote with an opposing posi-
tion on the vote. Members can then place a statement in the
Congressional Record indicating how they would have voted,
but deliberately choose not to vote in a prearranged deal to
maintain the expected vote margin that would have occurred if
both of the paired legislators were present.
 3. An alternative way to operationalize indifference in an ideal
point model is to calculate voting utility using the estimated
legislator ideal points and bill locations. This can be ana-
lyzed after the ideal points are estimated, as in Rothenberg
and Sanders (1999), or it can be jointly estimated, as modeled
in Rosas, Shomer, and Haptonstahl (2010). In both cases, the
behavioral model implied is that legislators derive utility from
position taking rather than legislative outcomes. I do not adopt
the Rothenberg and Sanders approach because while cutlines
and ideal points are well identified, bill locations are not. For
proof that the location of the proposal and status quo locations
are not identified using voting data alone under reasonable
conditions, see Peress (2013).
 4. While both Cohen and Noll and Poole and Rosenthal find that
nonvoting rates increase when the outcome is certain, they jus-
tify their findings in different ways. For Cohen and Noll, non-
voting is driven by the desire of legislators to be reelected, and
voting is costly because the opportunity cost of voting is time
that could be better spent raising campaign money and provid-
ing constituent services. Poole and Rosenthal instead justify
nonvoting by arguing that legislators care about policy, so the
utility of voting increases as the probability of becoming the
pivotal vote increases.
5. Noury (2004) considers the possibility that nonvotes and
vote margin are endogenous by using an Expected Closeness
variable in his analysis of Present-Not-Voting votes in the
European Parliament, and finds that his results are unchanged
even when simultaneity bias is corrected for.
6. While the utility functions imply substantively different
behavior when choices lie at the extremes, the choice of util-
ity function has little effect on the rank ordering of the recov-
ered coordinates. See Carroll, Lewis, Lo, Poole, and Rosenthal
(2009) for a more detailed comparison of similarities and
differences.
7. A key distinction in Jones' study is the difference between
nonvoting and position taking. Jones measures position avoid-
ance as a roll call vote on which a member does not vote, pair,
or otherwise announce a position. In contrast, nonvoting more
generally includes cases where a legislator might announce a
position or pair with another legislator.
8. In contrast, the effect of constituency ideological diversity
from the least to most diverse district is only 26.6%.
 9. One well-known example of this behavior occurred during a
vote on an antiabortion bill in Illinois.Although Obama report-
edly opposed the bill and wanted to vote against it, Planned
Parenthood of Illinois convinced him and other Democrats to
vote Present in a concerted effort to protest the bill (Hernandez
& Drew, 2007).
10. This class of model is also known in the literature as a partial
credit model.
11. Note that in the absence of valence considerations (i.e.,
 jk = 0 ), estimation is unchanged, and one subsequently
recovers  
jk jk
= - 2 . The goal here is simply to show that
even in the presence of valence considerations across alterna-
tives, which will often be true, recovery of the primary esti-
mand of interest x
i is still possible.
Lo 13
12. In fact, Equation 3 of Rosas and Shomer, which specifies the
utility of a Yea vote, is identical to a two-dimensional item-
response model.
13. For an ideal-point model that captures the mechanism of indif-
ference more accurately, see Rosas et al. (2010)
14. A useful point to note here is that this model enjoys some pro-
tection from random error. In cases where nonvotes pool from
ideologically diverse sources infrequently, the presence of
valence will mitigate the pooling effects that are shown here.
15. Coding of presidential votes, and all roll call data, comes from
Keith Poole's Voteview website at www.voteview.com.
16. Treier (2010) argues that by including positions based on sign-
ing bills into law, presidential ideal point estimates for Bush
moderate significantly. However, the point estimate of this
moderating effect in the 109th House is less than 0.1, which
cannot account for the implausible shifts seen when Bush's
ideal point is estimated while treating nonvotes as informative
locations.
17. The Democrats controlled 201 seats at the start of the 109th
Congress.
18. Note that Optimal Classification also does not treat nonvoting
as informative. Nevertheless, the result is suggestive in dem-
onstrating that Lewis's ideal point ranking is largely insensi-
tive to the choice of utility function.
19. The website for the Illinois state legislature typically records
the result of each roll call separately, which allows them to be
scraped with custom Python scripts. However, these records
are not available for the 90th senate.
20. An exception to this is the possibility that legislators vote
Present in cases where there exists a conflict of interest.
However, there is little evidence that suggests that this occurs
frequently.
21. One notable example of this was a sex crimes bill that would
permit victims of sex crimes to petition judges to seal court
records of their cases. This bill passed unanimously in the
House and 58-0-1 in the Senate, with Obama casting the sole
Present vote based on his belief that the bill violated the First
Amendment.
22. Classification of legislation as "major" reflects only a subjec-
tive reading of the bill's content from Table 3.
23. Similar numbers appear for the six Democrats who lost their
seats during the same period. Losing Democrats voted Present
an average of 19.5 times, while the overall Democratic mean
was 21.1 Present votes during the 92nd Senate.
24. Using the posterior samples, the model estimate Obama's ideal
point in the 93rd Senate to be located to the right of Senators
Link, del Valle, and Cullerton with greater than 95% probability,
whereas he was estimated to the left of these Senators in the
92nd Senate. Nevertheless, this does not conclusively show that
Obama moderated his voting record because only relative dis-
tances are identified in an ideal point model--Hence, it is also
possible that the three senators listed here all shifted to the left
following the Democratic takeover of the Illinois state senate.
