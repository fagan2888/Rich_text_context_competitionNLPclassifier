Hagopian et al. (2018), the reply paper to Spagat and van
Weezel (2017) which is, in turn, our critique of Hagopian
et al. (2013), does not address either of our two central
points. These are as follows (Spagat and van Weezel, 2017).
First, any appropriate 95% uncertainty interval (UI) for non-
violent excess deaths is at least 500,000 deaths wide and
starts many tens of thousands of deaths below zero. Second,
we find no local spill over effects running from violence
levels to elevated non-violent death rates.1 Both these results
refute the `conservative' estimate of several hundred thou-
sand non-violent excess deaths given in Hagopian et al.
(2013). The fact that Hagopian et al. (2018) ignore these two
points suggests that the authors of that paper are unable to
respond.
The very long reply paper (Hagopian et al., 2018) focuses
exclusively on secondary points and ad hominem attacks.
We address below as many secondary points as possible,
subject to space constraints, while relegating further
responses to Michael Spagat's blog (https://mikespagat.
wordpress.com/).2 We follow the organization of Hagopian
et al. (2018), quoting their numbered points below.
`1. Conflating violent deaths with non-violent deaths in
making excess-death calculations'
We agree with Hagopian et al. (2018) that the human costs
of war go well beyond just deaths. However, we do not
consider that this observation provides a licence to exag-
gerate the number of deaths in war. We also agree that war
violence in Iraq has probably led indirectly to some non-
violent deaths. However, we maintain that the small sample
from the University Collaborative Iraq Mortality Study
(UCIMS) is inadequate with regard to shedding much light
on such deaths.
The authors profess confusion over our observation that
they conflate violent deaths with non-violent ones, so we
clarify this point in the next paragraph.
We do not argue that Hagopian et al. (2013) conflate vio-
lent deaths with non-violent deaths always and everywhere.
In fact, our own estimates rely on the fact that the UCIMS
dataset distinguishes between violent deaths and non-vio-
lent deaths. We also insist that any meaningful attempt to
understand the extent to which violence may cause non-
violent deaths must maintain separate accounts for the two
types of deaths as a prerequisite for analysing the relation-
ship between the two. Hagopian et al. (2013), however, mix
violent deaths interchangeably with non-violent deaths at
the core of their analysis. Indeed, this conflation is embed-
ded in the very definition of an excess death rate: the rate of
violent plus non-violent deaths during a war minus the rate
Terms and conditions still apply: A
rejoinder to Hagopian et al.

Abstract
Spagat and van Weezel have re-analysed the data of the University Collaborative Iraq Mortality Study (UCIMS) and found
fatal weaknesses in the headline-grabbing estimate of 500,000 excess deaths presented, in 2013, by Hagopian et al. The
authors of that 2013 paper now defend their estimate and this is our rejoinder to their reply which, it is contended here,
avoids the central points, addresses only secondary issues and makes ad hominem attacks. We use our narrow space
constraint to refute some of the reply's secondary points and indicate a few areas of agreement.

of violent plus nonviolent deaths before a war. The gargan-
tuan UI of Hagopian et al. (2013), running from 48,000 to
751,000 excess deaths (violent plus non-violent), is dragged
over the finish line of zero by more than 200,000 violent
deaths. Strip away this confounding element and the UI for
non-violent deaths shifts down to ­210,000 to 409,000, a
flimsy basis for confident claims of hundreds of thousands
of non-violent deaths caused by the Iraq war.
`2. Incorrectly ignoring the impact of stratification'and
`3.
Failing to use correct statistical technique'
combined
We have now digested the Galway et al. (2012) paper and
realize that the UCIMS sample was not conceived to be a
stratified one. Specifically, the number of clusters in each
governorate was not fixed in advance at the numbers given
in Table 1 of Hagopian et al. (2013) as much of our analysis
assumed. This is a point worth noting; however, for two
reasons set out in the next two paragraphs, it does not affect
our conclusions.
First, our Table A2 (Spagat and van Weezel, 2017) pro-
vides estimates both with and without stratification adjust-
ments. In particular, columns 1, 5, 7 and 9 of Table A2 all
have no stratification adjustment, yet each of these uncer-
tainty intervals for non-violent excess deaths is more than
500,000 deaths wide and begins tens of thousands of deaths
below zero. Moreover, our differences-in-differences esti-
mates, which Hagopian et al. (2018) ignore, do not use strati-
fication adjustments.
Second, there is a good case for applying a stratifica-
tion adjustment even though the UCIMS sampling
method would not necessitate one in a large enough sam-
ple. The UCIMS sampled only 100 clusters and the real-
ized vector of clusters per governorate diverges
substantially from population proportions in many gover-
norates. Indeed, the implied relative weights, which we
provide in our Table 1, range from 0.50 all the way up to
2.75. Although these relative weights should theoreti-
cally approach 1.0 in a large sample, they can and do turn
out highly imbalanced in a 100-cluster sample. Thus it
can make sense to stratify the UCIMS sample anyway, as
one might do if sampling a population known to be half
female after drawing a sample that turns out to contain
only 40% females.
`4. Not discounting deaths when a certificate was not
available'
Our two main points, stated above in our first paragraph,
are valid even if we accept all reported deaths regardless of
death certificate confirmation. In fact, our differences-
in-differences analysis assumes that all reported deaths are
real. Nevertheless, death certificates are still worth discuss-
ing, and so we do so briefly.
We never claimed that reported deaths without death
certificates should simply be ignored. We argued only that
death certificate status should play some role in mortality
estimation. Hagopian et al. (2018) themselves state that
`Because most households in Iraq secure a death certifi-
cate at the time of death, we added this additional con-
firmatory step'. We then have to ask, what is the point of
having a `confirmatory step' if we are to consider all
reported deaths as 100% confirmed regardless of whether
or not they clear this confirmatory hurdle? We do not pro-
pose a unique discount rate for reported deaths not con-
firmed by death certificates but, rather, offer a range of
estimates based on different treatments of the death cer-
tificate data the authors themselves collected but then
ignore in their estimation.
The only argument Hagopian et al. (2018) make for
accepting in full all reported deaths is that much of the lit-
erature does so; however, the correctness of this fully
accepting approach is a non-validated assumption, not an
established fact. It is naïve to assume that interviewees
invariably give truthful responses to their interviewers, par-
ticularly in conflict zones (Fujii, 2010).
`5. Overestimating the effects of migration on sup-
pressing mortality'
Here we expand on the brief paragraph in Spagat and van
Weezel (2017) that rejects the Hagopian et al. (2013) treat-
ment of refugees to inflate their excess deaths estimate
from 405,000 up to 500,000.
(a) First, the UCIMS is already a good survey with
an open dataset. Why contaminate this work with
a `back-of-an-envelope' calculation based on
closed data from another survey designed for
other purposes? This manoeuvre foists what is, at
best, an educated guess on top of a data-based
estimate.
(b) This guesstimated death rate, presented without a UI,
barely exceeds the UCIMS-based estimated pre-war
death rate and is lower than the UCIMS-based esti-
mated during-war death rate. It is not clear, therefore,
that accounting for refugees should even have much
of an effect on an excess deaths estimate in the first
place.
(c) The Hagopian et al. (2013) (UCIMS-based) excess
death estimate necessarily relies on official popula-
tion projections. This is because estimated excess
mortality rates must be multiplied by population
numbers to arrive at an excess-death number.
However, the annual population numbers that
Hagopian et al. (2013) use increase mechanically at
a rate of about 2.9% per year with no sign of deduc-
tions to account for an exodus of two million refu-
gees. Thus, in effect, the UCIMS-based excess
Spagat and Van Weezel 3
death estimate already covers refugees. Any migra-
tion adjustment can therefore only be based on the
difference between an estimated (and poorly meas-
ured, according to the argument in point a) excess
death rate for the refugee population and an esti-
mated excess death rate for the UCIMS population.
Point b implies that such a difference would be
negative, which suggests that accounting for ref-
uges should probably reduce, rather than increase,
the 405,000 estimate.
(d) Nevertheless, we recognize the point of Hagopian
et al. (2018), that the Hagopian et al. (2013) figure
of 56,000 is meant to be for violent deaths. These
could all potentially be viewed as excess since there
was little violence before the war. However,
Hagopian et al. (2013) offer no information on non-
violent death rates for refugees, and these may well
be lower than the UCIMS-measured rates; if so, this
would necessitate a reduction in an excess-death
estimate (point (c)). Overall, it is bad practice to
cobble together UCIMS-based excess deaths with
poorly measured and documented refugee violent
deaths while omitting information on refugee non-
violent deaths that are a necessary part of any stand-
ard excess-deaths calculation.
(e) Hagopian et al. (2013) add their dubious 56,000
refugee number to 405,000 and round up to the
headline-grabbing figure of 500,000 which is then
characterized as `conservative'. Hagopian et al.
(2018) excuse this inflationary rounding as neces-
sary to avoid conveying a false sense of precision.
However, Hagopian et al. (2013) repeatedly round
estimates to the nearest 1000.3 After routinely round-
ing to the nearest 1000, then having suddenly
claimed that even rounding to the nearest 10,000 is
too precise, Hagopian et al. (2013) round to the near-
est 100,000. Finally, after the move from 405,000 all
the way up to 500,000, this half-a-million estimate is
presented as `conservative' ­ largely because,
according to the authors, the refugee adjustment of
56,000 plus 39,000 of rounding is still too small.
To summarize, Hagopian et al. (2018) do not address our
main points set out in paragraph one above. Nevertheless,
we address some secondary points in our rejoinder and
refer readers to Michael Spagat's blog for more.
