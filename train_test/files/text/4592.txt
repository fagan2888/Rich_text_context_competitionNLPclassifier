Abstract
Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine the effect of age, femoral head
migration, and ambulatory status on radiographic outcomes after combined pelvic and femoral
reconstruction in children with cerebral palsy. The secondary aim was to evaluate the fate of the
opposite hip after unilateral reconstruction.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study design of consecutive patients from 1995­2009 was used.
The records were screened for patients who underwent varus derotational osteotomy and
modified Dega osteotomy.
Results: Eighty-five hips in 71 patients were included. The mean age was 8.4 Æ 3.2 years and the
mean follow-up was 6.6 Æ 3.1 years. The final measures were a mean migration index of
20% Æ 15.58%, centre edge angle of 28.45 Æ 15.98, and Sharp's angle of 40.75 Æ 8.5. Those
values were not correlated with age and the initial migration index. Nonambulatory status did not
negatively affect hip stability. Final measurements of the contralateral hips were similar to the
reconstructed hips, and the cumulative incidence for later reconstruction was 5.67%.
Conclusions: Regardless of age, preoperative displacement, and ambulation, the combined
procedure provides durable radiographic improvement. In unilateral cases, there is a low risk of
later deterioration of the opposite side.

Introduction
The overall prevalence of hip displacement
in patients with cerebral palsy ranges from
17% to 35%. In nonambulatory patients
with gross motor function classification
system (GMFCS) levels IV and V, the risk
of hip displacement is as high as 66%.1­3

Hip instability is a concern mainly because
of pain.4A reduced hip may ease handling
for caregivers.5 Over the last 2 decades, there
has been an increased interest in hip surveil-
lance with various protocols aiming to
increase early preventive soft tissue surgery
and minimise late osseous reconstructive
interventions.6,7
Indications, timing, and the exact nature
of the reconstructive procedures for hip
displacement vary among practising
groups. There is less controversy regarding
the indications for lengthening of contracted
adductor muscles and the iliopsoas tendon
to relieve the deforming forces. The main
indication for varus derotational osteotomy
(VDRO) is a migration index (MI) greater
than 40% to 60%.8­10 Eilert and MacEwen
suggested that the ``golden age'' for inter-
vention is between 4 and 8 years for minimal
varus remodelling and this has good poten-
tial for acetabular remodelling.11 Later
reports noted more recurrence of hip dis-
placement in patients aged younger than 4
years.12,13 Pelvic osteotomies have been
added to VDRO to address acetabular dys-
plasia and resubluxation in a staged fash-
ion.14,15 Additionally, other authors have
recommended single-staged combined pro-
cedures that include pelvic osteotomy with
VDRO.9,16 Besides a younger age, several
reports have indicated that a high initial
migration index and poor preoperative
mobility are detrimental to the longevity of
correction.17­19Moreover, recent studies
suggested a lower threshold for intervening
on the opposite side in this patient
population.20­22
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate
radiographic parameters after VDRO com-
bined with modified Dega osteotomy in
children with cerebral palsy, taking into
account age, femoral head migration, and
ambulatory status. The secondary objective
of this study was to examine progression of
the opposite hip after unilateral
reconstruction.
Patients and methods
Selection of patients
The institutional review board of the
Research Institute of the McGill University
Health Centre approved the study (Study
Code: 11-737-PED). We performed a retro-
spective review of consecutive patients who
underwent a single-staged VDRO and mod-
ified Dega osteotomy at Montreal
Children's Hospital and Montreal Shriners
Hospital for Children from May 1995 to
December 2009.
The inclusion criteria were hip displace-
ment due to cerebral palsy, combined single-
staged surgery, open triradiate cartilage,
absence of previous osseous intervention
around the hip, and a minimum follow-up
of 2 years.
Clinical parameters
The charts were reviewed for age, sex, side of
surgery, and the need for open reduction.
We also collected data related to the type of
cerebral palsy, as well as GMFCS level.
GMFCS levels II­III were called ambula-
tory and levels IV and V were nonambula-
tory. Postoperative adverse events were
reviewed, as well as any additional surgical
treatments. For observation of the contra-
lateral hip, we noted subsequent interven-
tions and whether they were planned from
the beginning or whether the decision was
made later, based on radiographic progres-
sion of the subluxation.
Radiographic measurements
Pre- and postoperative supine frontal pelvic
radiographs were reviewed for the standard
MI as described by Reimers.8 Pelvic obli-
quity (PO), which was the angle between the
acetabular tear drops and the horizontal
reference frame, was recorded from the
initial radiographs.23 Final radiographs
were examined for the MI, centre edge

angle (CEA), Sharp's angle, PO, the
presence of heterotopic ossification, and
avascular necrosis (AVN). We also applied
the Melbourne Cerebral Palsy Hip
Classification System (MCPHCS) to the
final follow-up radiographs. This system is
a reliable, six-grade, ordinal scale.24,25
For the opposite side, the preoperative,
postoperative, and follow-up MI, as well as
the follow-up Sharp's angle and CEA, were
recorded. We also documented if the patient
had spinal instrumentation. All of the meas-
urements were carried out by the first
author.
Surgical procedure
The indications for the combined procedure
in this study were subluxation to the MI
greater than 40% to 50% in patients older
than 5 years of age, and a MI greater than
60% to 70% in younger patients. These
indications were regardless of previous
treatments and ambulatory status. The sur-
gical protocol was similar in all of the
patients. First, the hip adductors and iliop-
soas tendons were released. Second, the hip
was assessed for reducibility. If concentric
reduction was not possible, a standard
anterior approach to the hip was used to
perform open reduction and capsulorrha-
phy. Third, VDRO was carried out through
a lateral approach. We avoided varus to
neck­shaft angles less than 100 and roughly
estimated the amount of varus required by
the degree of hip abduction required for a
concentric reduction. The implant that was
chosen for fixation of the VDRO was based
on the surgeon's preference. A modified
Dega osteotomy was performed as described
by Mubarak et al.9 Moulds were taken for
abduction brace measurements, and a hip
spica was applied for approximately 6
weeks, followed by physiotherapy and
night-time splinting. In unilateral cases, the
contralateral hip adductors and iliopsoas
were released if contracted.
Statistical analysis
Normality and equality of variances for
continuous data were assessed graphically.
Correlations were performed by Pearson's
method. Fisher's exact test was used for
count data. For parametric values, the
independent two-tailed t-test was used. For
nonparametric variables, the Mann­
Whitney­Wilcoxon test was applied. Two-
tailed p values of < 0.05 were considered
significant. We used R software for statis-
tical analysis, version 3.3.1 (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
From an initial 105 candidates, 34 were
excluded because of incomplete radio-
graphs. Therefore, a total of 71 patients
(85 hips) were included in the analysis, with
57 unilateral and 14 bilateral combined
procedures. There were 34 boys and 37
girls. A total of 38 hips were on the right
and 47 were on the left. The mean Æ SD age
at the time of the procedure was 8.4 Æ 3.2
years (19­201 months). The mean follow-up
was 6.6 Æ 3.1 years (24­177 months). There
were 66 (92.9%) patients with spastic cere-
bral palsy, four (5.63%) had the mixed type,
and one (1.4%) was hypotonic. Among the
patients, 50 (70.4%) were diagnosed with
quadriplegia, 17 were diplegic (23.9%),
three (4.2%) had hemiplegia, and one
(1.4%) was triplegic. There was GMFCS
level I in no patients, level II in seven (9.8%),
level III in 14 (19.7%), level IV in 11
(15.5%), and level V in 39 (54.9%).
The change in the MI over time is shown
in Figure 1. The final radiographic measures
were an MI of 20% Æ 15.58% (0%­71%),
CEA of 28.45 Æ 15.98 (À27to 68), and
Sharp's angle of 40.75 Æ 8.5 (14­58).
These measures were not associated with
age and the initial MI (Table 1). Although
preoperative displacement was greater in
nonambulatory patients, they did not have
Alassaf et al. 477
a higher amount of subluxation compared
with ambulatory patients (Table 2).
Moreover, PO did not improve, regardless
of subsequent fusion of scoliosis to the pelvis
and ambulatory status (Table 3). None of
the patients had instrumented fusion for
scoliosis before the combined procedure. At
the final follow-up, MCPHCS was grade 1 in
23 hips, grade 2 in 10 hips, grade 3 in 33 hips,
and grade 4 in 19 hips.

Of the 57 patients with unilateral com-
bined procedures, six had osseous interven-
tion either concomitantly or shortly
afterwards. Three of these six patients had
VDRO on the same day as the combined
procedure. Of these three patients, one
required revision of VDRO to a combined
procedure 1 year later. The fourth hip
underwent VDRO 1 year after the index
procedure. The fifth hip had an unplanned
combined procedure 3 years later. The sixth
hip underwent a shelf augmentation proced-
ure 2 years after the combined procedure on
the other hip. Therefore, 54 opposite hips
were available for radiographic review
(Figure 2). There were no significant
differences in the final measurements of
contralateral hips compared with recon-
structed hips. In contralateral hips, the
mean MI was 25.72% Æ 20.94% (p ¼ 0.29),
CEA was 22.63 Æ 27.04 (p ¼ 0.51), and
Sharp's angle was 42.1 Æ 7.1 (p ¼ 0.52).
Only three osseous hip interventions of 54
(5.67%) at risk were planned after the
combined procedure based on follow-up
radiographs.
There were seven unplanned trips to the
operating room, with a reoperation rate of
9.8% (Table 4). There were nine cases of
AVN. Six of 24 hips that required

Discussion
In approximately half of patients with cere-
bral palsy, hip instability is associated with
pain.4 Hip reconstruction reduces pain and
improves subjective measures, such as ease
of care and parental satisfaction. Up to 86%
of parents would recommend surgery to
another parent.26,27 Recently, DiFazio
et al.28 found a strong correlation between
the Child Health Index of Life with
Disabilities score and the MI.
Correction attained with the combined
procedure appears to be stable over time. In
our study, the mean final MI was
20% Æ 15.58%, which is comparable with
similar reports.9,23,29 The final mean CEA
and Sharp's angle were 28.45 Æ 15.98 and
40.75 Æ 8.5, respectively. The lowest
normal CEA of Wiberg reported by Tonnis
was 19, and Sharp considered measure-
ments between 39 and 42 to be within the
upper limit of normality.30,31
In a previous study, only one of the 18
hips that underwent the combined proced-
ure using a modified Dega osteotomy and
soft tissue lengthening developed sublux-
ation after a minimum follow-up of 3 years
and 8 months.9 McNerney et al.32 reported
104 hips in 92 patients who underwent a
single-stage combined procedure. In their
study, the mean follow-up was 6.9 years.
Pelvic osteotomy was mostly a modified
Dega osteotomy, but Pemberton and Salter
osteotomies were also used. A total of 31%
of patients required subsequent surgery to
maintain reduction. A total of 95% of the
hips remained reduced and there were no
redislocations. Braatz et al.33 reported the
outcomes after the combined procedure in
72 hips in patients with cerebral palsy. In
their study, at a mean follow-up of 7.7 years,
89% of hips had an MI less than 30%, which
is similar to a another previous report.29
We did not find a significant correlation
between the patients' age and the final
radiographic measurements. In a long-term
study by Brunner et al.13 the minimum
follow-up was 11 years, and there were
smaller CEAs in patients with cerebral
palsy who had femoral procedures before
the age of 4 years. The authors concluded
that femoral osteotomy alone did not main-
tain sufficient acetabular coverage. The MI
was not measured in Brunner et al.'s13 study.
Another femoral reconstruction only cohort
study was performed by Noonan et al.17,
with an average follow-up of 5.2 years.
Using the MI, the authors found less hip
subluxation in patients who were operated
on before 6 years old (18%) than in children
who were older (33%) at the time of recon-
struction. They also found a 28% overall
risk of later displacement. They concluded
that in older children, pelvic osteotomy
should be considered in addition to femoral
varus osteotomy and muscle balancing pro-
cedures. Recently, Mallet et al.29 found no
difference during skeletal maturity after the
combined procedure between patients who
were younger and older than 8 years at the
time of reconstruction, which is similar to a
finding by Settecerri et al.19 Rutz et al.27 did
not find an association in a multivariate
analysis between age at the time of surgery
and final MI in a long-term study of 168 hip
reconstructions that included transiliac
osteotomy.
Several studies have found worse long-
term outcomes in patients with more pre-
operative displacement.17,19,27 Only a few
patients in these reports had pelvic osteo-
tomies, and even fewer had modified Dega
osteotomies. In our study, there was no
association between the preoperative MI
and later displacement, which is similar to
a previous report on the combined proced-
ure.26 Moreover, in a study of 144 recon-
structed hips by Bayusentono et al.34,
nonambulatory patients had more deterior-
ation in the MI, but only 80 hips in the
cohort had pelvic osteotomy. Recently, in a
study of 57 hips reconstructed with femoral
and pelvic osteotomies, Reidy et al.35 did not
find a difference in the final MI between
Alassaf et al. 481
walkers and non-walkers. In the present
study, nonambulatory status was not asso-
ciated with poor radiographic results.
Additionally, there was no positive effect
on PO after the combined procedure. This
finding is similar to that by Abousamra
et al.36 who studied 12 unilateral hip dis-
placements treated with the combined pro-
cedure in ambulatory children.
Treatment of the opposite hip remains
controversial. Carr and Gage warned
against unilateral soft tissue hip surgery in
nonambulatory patients with cerebral palsy
because it may induce subluxation in the
contralateral hip.37 In another study, only
nine of 35 untreated hips remained nondis-
placed after 4.2 years of follow-up.20 In a
previous study, only two of 48 nonoperated
hips had femoral osteotomies for progres-
sive subluxation.19 Canavese et al.21 found a
44% risk of later bony reconstruction of
well-seated non-operated contralateral hips
in patients with GMFCS levels III­V when
reviewed at skeletal maturity. In a study of
35 unilateral hip reconstructions, Shukla
et al.38 noted progressive contralateral hip
subluxation in 17 patients, and it was less in
hips that had soft tissue release. In our
unilateral osseous reconstructions, spasticity
in the contralateral hip was addressed sur-
gically prior to or during the combined
procedure. We found that the incidence of
subsequent contralateral reconstruction
was 5.67%.
The probability of adverse events asso-
ciated with hip surgery in patients with
cerebral palsy is high.39-41 More than half
of the patients in our study had at least one
complication. Root et al.42 showed that the
risk of AVN was 22.9% after routine
capsulotomy. A total of 10.6% of hips
developed AVN in our study, and this rate
was higher after open reduction. A total of
9.7% of our patients indicated the presence
of hip pain at the final follow-up, which is
similar to a previous finding by Baraka
et al.43 and Braatz et al.44
This study was retrospective with no
comparison group. Radiographic measure-
ments were used as a surrogate for import-
ant outcome measures. Ideally, accurate
assessment of pain, function, and quality
of life is preferred. In conclusion, the
combined procedure provides predictable
radiographic results, regardless of age, pre-
operative hip migration, and ambulatory
status. In the unilateral combined pro-
cedure, there is a low risk for future dis-
placement on the contralateral
unreconstructed hip.
