ABSTRACT
ROS (reactive oxygen species) play an essential role in the
pathophysiology of diabetes, stroke and neurodegenerative
disorders. Hyperglycaemia associated with diabetes
enhances ROS production and causes oxidative stress in
vascular endothelial cells, but adverse effects of either
acute or chronic high-glucose environments on brain
parenchymal cells remain unclear. The PPP (pentose
phosphate pathway) and GSH participate in a major
defence mechanism against ROS in brain, and we explored
the role and regulation of the astroglial PPP in response to
acute and chronic high-glucose environments. PPP activity
was measured in cultured neurons and astroglia by deter-
mining the difference in rate of 14CO2
production from
[1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose. ROS production, mainly
H2
O2
, and GSH were also assessed. Acutely elevated glucose
concentrations in the culture media increased PPP activity
and GSH level in astroglia, decreasing ROS production.
Chronically elevated glucose environments also induced
PPP activation. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed
that chronic high-glucose environments induced ER
(endoplasmic reticulum) stress (presumably through
increased hexosamine biosynthetic pathway flux). Nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45
subunit-related factor 2), which regulates G6PDH (glycer-
aldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) by enhancing
transcription, was also observed in association with BiP
(immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein) expression.
Acute and chronic high-glucose environments activated
the PPP in astroglia, preventing ROS elevation. Therefore a
rapid decrease in glucose level seems to enhance ROS
toxicity, perhaps contributing to neural damage when
insulin levels given to diabetic patients are not properly
calibrated and plasma glucose levels are not adequately
maintained. These findings may also explain the lack of
evidence for clinical benefits from strict glycaemic control
during the acute phase of stroke.

INTRODUCTION
Brain function is exclusively dependent on the oxidative
metabolism of glucose (Clarke and Sokoloff, 1999; Dienel,
2009). Even though the theoretical ratio of the CMRoxy
(cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen) and the CMRglc
(cerebral
metabolic rate of glucose) for the complete oxidation of
glucose is 6, the values measured in the human brain during a
non-activated, steady state are always lower than 6 (5.0­5.5),
indicating that more glucose is consumed than oxidized. This
observation has been interpreted as reflecting glucose
utilization for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, cellular
structural components and release of small amounts of
lactate from brain (Clarke and Sokoloff, 1999; Dienel, 2009).
When activated, the local CMRglc
increases in distinct regions
of the brain and transient increases in lactate production
(Prichard et al., 1991) associated with the decrease in the
CMRoxy
/CMRglc
ratio are observed (Fox and Raichle, 1986; Fox
et al., 1988; Madsen et al., 1999), leading to the hypothesis
that activated brain utilizes glucose to produce ATP through

glycolysis, rather than oxidative phosphorylation (Fox and
Raichle, 1986; Fox et al., 1988). Another pathway that con-
tributes to increased glucose utilization without oxygen
consumption is the PPP (pentose phosphate pathway), which
involves oxidative decarboxylation of carbon one of glucose
to generate NADPH for management of oxidative stress; for
every six glucose molecules entering the PPP, one glucose
equivalent is released as CO2
.
Astroglia play a pivotal role in glucose metabolism for
energy production in the brain (Dienel and Hertz, 2005; Hertz
et al., 2007). At least one-half or more of the total glucose
utilization in the brain has been ascribed to astroglia (Itoh
et al., 2004; Nehlig et al., 2004; Hyder et al., 2006). Moreover,
a long-lasting debate exists regarding the ANLSH (astrocyte-
neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis) (Pellerin and Magistretti,
1994; Magistretti et al., 1999; Chih et al., 2001; Bouzier-Sore
et al., 2003; Chih and Roberts, 2003; Pellerin and Magistretti,
2003; Dienel and Cruz, 2004; Hertz, 2004; Hertz et al., 2007;
Pellerin et al., 2007; Jolivet et al., 2010), which proposes that
the sites of glucose consumption and lactate production
in the activated brain are located in astrocytes, irrespective of
the controversy regarding the site of the production and neu-
ronal utilization of lactate (Bak et al., 2009; Contreras and
Satrustegui, 2009; DiNuzzo et al., 2009; Mangia et al., 2009).
However, the benefit, if it exists, of such compartmentation
of glucose metabolism in neurons and astroglia remains un-
certain. These facts and controversy suggest that the excess
utilization of glucose compared with oxygen in the brain as a
whole may be clinically relevant to the disease pathology, and
that if the glycolytic metabolism of glucose predominates in
astrocytes, these cells may play important roles through their
glucose metabolism in the pathophysiology of metabolic
disorders of the brain, such as diabetic encephalopathy. Al-
though a possible role of glycolysis as a survival pathway
rather than an energy production pathway has been
postulated (Bolan
~os et al., 2010), glycolysis in astroglia has
not been extensively studied as in cultured neurons (Bolan
~os
et al., 2010).
As for neuronal energy production dependent on mito-
chondrial oxidative metabolism of glucose, ROS (reactive
oxygen species) derived from the mitochondria in neural cells
may play a harmful role in stroke (Mehta et al., 2007) and
aging of the brain (Kregel and Zhang, 2007), as well as
neurodegenerative disorders (Jomova et al., 2010).
Hyperglycaemia is well known to enhance ROS production
in vascular endothelial cells, resulting in vascular diseases
(Brownlee, 2001, 2005). Despite the fact that diabetes mel-
litus is a risk factor for dementia of either the vascular or
Alzheimer's type (Biessels et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2009),
whether the hyperglycaemic state causes direct neuronal cell
damage remains controversial (Sommerfield et al., 2004; Cox
et al., 2005; McCall, 2005; Ryan, 2006; Manschot et al., 2007;
Sima, 2010). Even though a hyperglycaemic state is harmful
to parenchymal cells (i.e. neurons and astroglia), the
deleterious effects of a hyperglycaemic state do not seem
to be as devastating as they are to vascular endothelial cells.
In a clinical setting, an elevation in the blood glucose con-
centration is often observed during the acute phase of stroke
in patients, regardless of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and is
associated with a poor prognosis (Capes et al., 2001). Despite
the potential harmful effects of hyperglycaemia on brain
parenchymal cells in animal studies (Macdougall and Muir,
2011), the beneficial effects of lowering the blood glucose
level during the acute phase of stroke have not been
confirmed by clinical trials (Quinn and Lees, 2009; Kruyt et al.,
2010; McCormick et al., 2010). Although hyperglycaemia is
now generally accepted to exacerbate ischaemic damage, a
recent survey of clinical studies suggests that mild hypergly-
caemia is actually beneficial in cases with lacunar infarction
(Uyttenboogaart et al., 2007). These facts may indicate that
an appropriate glucose content in the brain is necessary to
protect brain cells against ischaemic cell damage.
The PPP branches from the glycolytic pathway of glucose
at glucose 6-phosphate, and the activity of the rate-limiting
enzyme of the PPP, G6PDH (glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase), is regulated by NADPH, peroxynitrite and
other factors, as well as by transcriptional mechanisms
(Dringen et al., 2007; Wamelink et al., 2008). The PPP is
generally considered to be a minor pathway of glucose
metabolism in resting brain, but it can be markedly up-
regulated under various conditions (e.g. Appel and Parrot,
1970) to generate NADPH, which in turn increases GSH to
detoxify ROS in concert with glutathione peroxidase (Dringen
et al., 2007). `Resting' PPP rate and the magnitude of PPP
increase during activation are known to be higher in
astrocytes than in neurons, although they are not negligible
in neurons (Ben-Yoseph et al., 1996a, 1996b; Delgado-
Esteban et al., 2000; Garci
´a-Nogales et al., 2003; Vaughn and
Deshmukh, 2008; Herrero-Mendez et al., 2009). Gandhi et al.
(2010) reported increased oxidative stress in cultured
astrocytes grown in high glucose and in the brain of diabetic
rats, and we therefore hypothesized that acute and chronic
hyperglycaemic states activate the PPP in astroglia to protect
the brain. In the present study, we explored the mechanisms
that are activated to regulate PPP under acute and chronic
hyperglycaemic conditions, focusing on ER (endoplasmic
reticulum) stress and the Keap1 (Kelch-like enoyl-CoA
hydratase-associated protein 1)/Nrf2 (nuclear factor-eryth-
roid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2) system, which is a master
regulator of phase-2 detoxifying enzymes such as G6PDH
(Thimmulappa et al., 2002).

Preparation of cells
Primary astroglial cultures were prepared from the cerebral
cortex of rat pups 24­48 h after birth (Takahashi et al., 1995).
The dissociated cells from the frontoparietal cortices
(2.56105 cells/ml) were plated (15 ml/flask) in uncoated
75 cm2 culture flasks (Sumitomo Bakelite) and cultured in a
glucose-containing medium (final concentration, 12 mmol/l
of D-glucose) comprised of DMEM with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml)
at 37°C in humidified air containing 7% CO2
(day 0). The
culture medium was changed every 2 days until the cultures
reached confluence. On day 11, the adherent cells were
treated with trypsin/EDTA solution, suspended in fresh high
(12 mmol/l)-glucose medium, and placed in uncoated 12-
and 24-well culture plates (0.8 and 0.4 ml/well respectively)
(Nalge Nunc) or in 25 cm2 culture flasks (5 ml/flask) (Nalge
Nunc). For immunohistochemical staining, the cells were
plated (2 ml/dish) on 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes
(Matsunami Glass Industry) precoated with PLL (poly-L-
lysine). Some cells were grown on glass-bottomed 24-well
culture plates (EZView culture plate LB) for fluorimetric assay.
From the day after subculturing, the cells were cultured in
DMEM, fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin and
a final D-glucose concentration of 5, 12 or 23 mmol/l for
10 days. The culture medium was changed twice a week, and
the cells were used once they reached confluence (on day 21
in vitro).
The primary neuronal and mixed neuronal­astroglial cul-
tures were prepared from the cortex and striatum of fetal rats
on embryonic day 16, as described previously (Takahashi
et al., 1995). The mechanically dissociated cells were placed in
12- and 24-well culture plates (0.8 and 0.4 ml/well,
respectively) or 25 cm2 culture flasks (5 ml/flask) coated
with PLL (5 mg/ml). For the neuronal cultures, viable cells
(1.56106 cells per ml) that excluded Trypan Blue were placed
in the cultures and Ara-C (cytosine arabinoside; 10 mmol/l)
was added 72 h later to induce the mitotic arrest of the
astroglia. For mixed neuronal­astroglial cultures, 1.06106
cells per ml were placed in PLL-coated plates and no Ara-C
was added. The cells were cultured in a glucose medium (final
concentration, 12 mmol/l D-glucose) at 37°C in humidified air
containing 7% CO2
. In vitro assays were performed using
cultures that were 7 or 8 days old. The nutrient medium
remained untouched until the experiments were initiated.
When neurons were grown on astroglial culture, the astroglial
cultures were prepared as described above; on culture day 21,
the neuronal cells were seeded on the astroglial cell layer and
Ara-C was added 72 h later. The cells were used for the assay
7 days after the neurons had been seeded.
Experimental protocol
To assess the effects of acutely changing concentrations of
D-glucose (2, 10, 20 mmol/l) on glucose metabolism, ROS
production and immunohistochemistry, the nutrient medium
(12 mmol/l) was removed and the cells were washed twice
with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing no glucose and
the cells were incubated with DBSS (Dulbecco's balanced salt
solution) containing 110 mmol/l NaCl, 5.4 mmol/l KCl,
1.8 mmol/l CaCl2
, 0.8 mmol/l MgSO4
, 0.9 mmol/l NaH2
PO4
and 44 mmol/l NaHCO3
in addition to 2, 10 or 20 mmol/l of
D-glucose supplemented with 18, 10 or 0 mmol/l L-glucose
respectively. The L-glucose was added to the culture media so
the medium osmolarity was the same for each experimental
group. To assess the chronic effects of high-glucose
environments, astroglial cells were cultured with DMEM
containing 5 (low-glucose medium) or 23 (high-glucose
medium) mmol/l D-glucose for 10 days, as described above.
The glucose concentrations during the assay procedure were
2, 10 or 20 mmol/l. Specific assay conditions are indicated in
the Figure legends for each experiment.
When astroglial cells were exposed to sulforaphane
[1-isothiocyanato-(4R,S)-(methylsulfinyl)butane; 10 mmol/l]
­ an Nrf2 activator, thapsigargin (1 mmol/l) ­ an ER stress
inducer or D-glucosamine (1­10 mmol/l) ­ a precursor of
N-acetylglucosamine generated through the hexosamine
biosynthetic pathway (another minor pathway of glucose
metabolism), the nutrient medium (5 mmol/l D-glucose) was
replaced with fresh medium (5 mmol/l D-glucose) containing
drugs of the indicated concentrations or appropriate vehicles
for 15 h. To evaluate the effect of different glucose
environments, immunohistochemically, astroglial cells that
had been cultured in a low-glucose medium (5 mmol/l) for

10 days, were exposed to DBSS containing 2, 10 or 20 mmol/l
D-glucose for 15 h. To assess the effects of long-term
exposure to different glucose environments on ROS produc-
tion, cells were cultured with DMEM containing 5 or
23 mmol/l D-glucose for 10 days before ROS measurement.
Assay for [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation
The rates of glucose phosphorylation in astroglia were
evaluated using a modification (Takahashi et al., 1995;
Abe et al., 2006a) of the [14C]deoxyglucose method (Sokoloff
et al., 1977). The culture medium of a 12-well plate was
replaced with 0.4 ml of DBSS containing 2, 10 and 20 mmol/l
D-glucose supplemented with 18, 10 and 0 mmol/l L-glucose
respectively. To keep the specific activity of [14C]deoxy-
glucose constant as the concentration of D-glucose was
increased, 12.5, 62.5 or 125 ml/ml of [14C]deoxyglucose
(original concentration: 3.7 MBq/ml) was added to each assay
solution and incubation was continued for 60 min at 37°C
in 7% CO2
. At the end of the incubation period, the DBSS
was replaced with a fresh reaction mixture lacking
[14C]deoxyglucose and incubation was continued at 37°C
in 7% CO2
for 5 min to allow the efflux of residual
[14C]deoxyglucose from the cells (Takahashi et al., 1995;
Abe et al., 2006a). This procedure allows the evaluation of
glucose phosphorylation activity instead of simple glucose
uptake activity. The cell carpets were washed quickly three
times with ice-cold PBS and digested in 1.0 ml of 0.1 mM
NaOH at room temperature. The cell digests were then
assayed for protein content using the BCA (bicinchoninic
acid) method (Smith et al., 1985), and the 14C count was
measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb
3100TR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The rates of glucose
phosphorylation (pmol of glucose/mg of protein per 60 min)
based on the conversion from [14C]deoxyglucose phosphor-
ylation over 60 min were then calculated from the specific
activity of [14C]deoxyglucose (i.e. mBq of [14C]deoxyglucose/
mmol of glucose) in the reaction mixture.
Measurement of the rate of D-[1-14C]glucose
and D-[6-14C]glucose oxidation to 14CO2
The rate of [14C]glucose oxidation to 14CO2
was measured
using a modification of a previously described method (Abe
et al., 2006a). After cells cultured in 25 cm2 culture flasks had
been washed twice with PBS containing no glucose, the assay
solutions were added and the flasks were capped with rubber
stoppers containing a centre well and incubated at 37°C
for 60 min. The 14CO2
produced was trapped by a cotton
ball placed in the centre well containing 100 ml of hyamine
hydroxide 10-X. The reactions were terminated by the
injection of 250 ml of 60% HClO4
through the rubber
stopper, and the flasks were kept at 4°C overnight to trap the
14CO2
. The centre wells were then transferred to 20 ml glass
scintillation counter vials, and 500 ml of ethanol and 10 ml of
Insta-Fluor Plus were added. The 14C contents of the vials
were evaluated using a liquid scintillation counter. The assay
solutions consisted of 2.5 ml of DBSS containing 2, 10 or
20 mmol/l D-glucose supplemented with 18, 10 or 0 mmol/l
L-glucose respectively; these solutions were labelled by
adding 1.0, 5.0 or 20.0 ml/ml of D-[1-14C]glucose or D-
[6-14C]glucose (original concentrations: 3.7 MBq/ml) to keep
the specific activities constant.
Waniewski and Martin (2004) reported that substantial 14C
counts were obtained from a flask without cells. There-
fore the 14C counts obtained from a flask without cells in
which the reaction had been stopped at 60 min were
regarded as the background values and were subtracted in
our studies. The cell carpets remaining in the incubation
flasks after the removal of the reaction mixtures were then
digested with 5 ml of 0.1 M NaOH, and their protein contents
were determined. The rates of total glucose oxidation (pmol
of glucose/mg of protein per 60 min) based on the conversion
from [14C]glucose into 14CO2
over 60 min were measured.
Measurement of PPP activity in cultured
astroglia and neurons
PPP activity was measured using a modification of the
method described by Hothersall et al. (1979). Briefly, cells
were incubated with glucose with tracer doses of
[1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose for 60 min and PPP rate
calculated as the difference between the 14CO2
derived from
[1-14C]glucose (metabolized by both PPP and the tricar-
boxylic acid cycle) and that derived from [6-14C]glucose
(metabolized by only the tricarboxylic acid cycle) was thought
to be an indicator of the PPP activity. To confirm the validity
of this tracer assay, 15 h prior to and during the PPP assay,
6-AN (6-aminonicotinamide; 500 mmol/l), a competitive
inhibitor of G6PDH, was added to the nutrient medium and
assay solution, and the PPP activity was measured. PPP is
known to be active in proliferating cells because PPP yields
ribose 5-phosphate for nucleotide biosynthesis, leading to
DNA and RNA synthesis. To evaluate the effects of the
proliferation of astroglia on PPP activity, Ara-C (10 mmol/l)
was added to the astroglial culture medium 48 h prior to
the assay to arrest cell division and the PPP activity was
evaluated.
Measurement of ROS production
The production of ROS, mainly H2
O2
, in cells was assessed
using H2
DCFDA (Gomes et al., 2005) and semi-quantitative
fluorimetric measurements. Just prior to the assay, the
nutrient medium was removed and the cells were washed
twice with PBS without glucose. Then, DBSS containing 10­
30 mmol/l H2
DCFDA dissolved in DMSO (final volume of
DMSO: 0.1%) supplemented with 2 mmol/l glucose were
added and the cells were incubated at 37°C in humidified air
with 7% CO2
for 30 min. After loading the H2
DCFDA for
30 min, the cells were washed twice again with PBS without
glucose and DBSS containing 2, 10 or 20 mmol/l D-glucose

with 18, 10 or 0 mmol/l L-glucose added respectively. The
cells were further incubated for 60 min, and the fluorescence
level indicating intracellular ROS production was measured at
0 and 60 min using a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite
200 PRO; Tecan Japan, Kanagawa, Japan; or Cytofluor 4000J;
Applied Biosystems Japan) with lex
at 485 nm and lem
at
530 nm. As the fluorescence signals increased linearly for up
to 60 min (data not shown), the results were expressed as the
percentage increase in the fluorescence signal at 60 min
compared with that at 0 min.
Measurement of GSH content using a
fluorimetric method
The intracellular content of GSH in astroglia was assessed using
MCB which forms an adduct with GSH via an enzymatic
reaction catalysed by glutathione transferases (Chatterjee et
al., 1999). Cells were incubated with MCB (50 mmol/l) for
30 min. The intracellular formation of the GSH­MCB adduct
was assessed using a microplate reader with lex
at 360 nm and
lem
at 460 nm. The results were expressed as the percentage
increase in the fluorescence signal over 60 min.
Immunohistochemistry
BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein) express-
ion, an ER stress indicator, or the translocation of Nrf2 from
the cytosol to the nucleus was assessed using immuno-
histochemistry. For detection of AGEs (advanced glycation
end-products), immunostaining of Ne-(carboxyethyl)lysine
was performed. Astroglial cells that were grown on a glass-
bottomed, 35 mm dish were fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA
(paraformaldehyde) for 10 min on ice. Then the cells were
permebilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room
temperature, followed by post-fixation with 4% PFA for
5 min on ice. For immunostaining, the cells were washed
twice with PBS containing MgCl2
and CaCl2
, and non-specific
IgG binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells in PBS
containing 3% BSA and 3% normal goat serum for 30 min at
room temperature. Cells were incubated with the primary
antibodies (mouse anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody, 1:200;
anti-Nrf2 polyclonal antibody, 1:100 or mouse anti-Ne-
(carboxyethyl)lysine antibody, 1:100 for 2 h at room temper-
ature). Then, the cells were incubated with the secondary
antibodies (rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG anti-
body or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody) with
DAPI (49,6-diamino-2-phenylindole) for nuclear staining for
1 h. The cells were examined using a laser confocal microscopy
system (Leica TCS SP5; Leica Microsystems).
Statistical analyses
Statistical comparisons among the values obtained for each
group were performed using grouped t tests or a one-way
ANOVA followed by the Dunnett test for multiple compar-
isons. A P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Effects of acute and chronic exposure to
elevated extracellular glucose concentrations on
glucose phosphorylation in cultured astroglia
Normal brain glucose concentration is approximately 20­25%
that in arterial plasma and it generally falls within the range of
2­3 and 5­7 mmol/g in normal and diabetic rat brain respe-
ctively (Gandhi et al., 2010). When astrocytes were grown in
culture medium containing 5, 12 or 23 mmol/l glucose, then
assayed for rates of glucose utilization with tracer amounts
of [14C]deoxyglucose in the reaction mixture containing
2 mmol/l glucose, there were no differences among the
cultures in the rates of glucose phosphorylation (Figure 1A).
In contrast, when astrocytes were grown in 12 mmol/l
glucose and assayed for glucose utilization rate in 2, 10 or
20 mmol/l glucose, the rate of glucose phosphorylation fell
by approximately 20% when the glucose level in the assay
mixture was much lower than that of the culture medium
and it increased by approximately 15% when glucose level in
the assay medium was elevated; glucose phosphorylation rate
varied linearly with respect to D-glucose concentration in the
assay mixture (Figure 1B).
Higher rates of glucose utilization when assay glucose
levels exceeded 2 mmol/l were unexpected findings because
the Km
of brain hexokinase for glucose is approximately
0.05 mmol/l (Grossbard and Schimke, 1966), and as long as
the enzyme is saturated (.1 mmol/l glucose) the reaction
rate would not change. Differences in the rate of
[14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation can, however, arise from
changes in the value of the lumped constant of the
deoxyglucose method, the factor that accounts for differ-
ences in transport and phosphorylation of deoxyglucose and
glucose (Sokoloff et al., 1977). The value of the lumped
constant increases sharply in the hypoglycaemic range, but it
is relatively stable during hyperglycaemia (Orzi et al., 1988;
Schuier et al., 1990), decreasing by ,20% as brain glucose
level rises 2.5-fold from 2 to 5 mmol/g (Dienel et al., 1991).
Values for the lumped constant are not available for higher
brain glucose levels and have not been determined in
different brain cell types, so changes in its value were not
were not taken into account in the present study. However,
correction of measured [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation
rates for changes in the value of the lumped constant would
be expected to modestly increase the calculated glucose
phosphorylation rates (Figure 1B) determined in 10 and
20 mmol/l D-glucose compared with that in 2 mmol/l D-
glucose and to slightly increase the slope of the regression
line. Also, these effects are not due to osmotic changes in the
culture medium, because the total D-/L-glucose concentra-
tions were kept constant by adding L-glucose, a biologically
inactive form of glucose, when the D-glucose concentration
was reduced.

Note that the rates of glucose phosphorylation in Figure 1
were calculated using the specific activities of [14C]deoxy-
glucose in the assay mixtures and do not include the lumped
constant in the denominator. Actual glucose utilization rates
are therefore higher than the calculated rates because the
lumped constant accounts for the slightly higher transport
rate (approximately 1.4-fold) and the 3-fold lower rate of
phosphorylation rate for deoxyglucose compared with
glucose; for in vivo experiments, the lumped constant is
0.48 (Sokoloff et al., 1977), indicating that two glucose
molecules are phosphorylated for each deoxyglucose mole-
cule phosphorylated. The rates in Figure 1 are therefore not
directly comparable with rates of 14CO2
production from [1-
and 6-14C]glucose oxidation (see below). To summarize,
changes in glucose utilization rate with acute change in
glucose level from the culture medium to the assay mixture
arise mainly from unidentified effects that are unrelated to
the maximal rate of hexokinase or the lumped constant and
probably involve regulation of glucose metabolism at
downstream sites.
PPP rate in cultured astroglia exceeds that in
cultured neurons and is influenced by glucose
level in the PPP assay mixture and culture
medium
PPP rates were determined separately in cultured astroglia
and neurons as the difference (Figure 2C) between the rates
of 14CO2
production from oxidation of [1-14C]glucose
(Figure 2A) and [6-14C]glucose (Figure 2B). Glucose oxidation
via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (i.e. 14CO2
production from
[6-14C]glucose) was higher in neurons compared with
astrocytes (Figures 2A and 2B), but the PPP activity in
astroglia was approximately 4­5 times higher than in neurons
(Figure 2C), consistent with previous reports (e.g. Ben-Yoseph
et al., 1996a, 1996b; Garci
´a-Nogales et al., 2003).
Decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose by astroglia was almost
completely eliminated by pre-treatment with 6-AN, and PPP
activity was reduced to approximately 3% of control by 6-AN
(Table 1). As the PPP activity of the astroglia was unaffected
by Ara-C-induced mitotic arrest (Table 1), the higher PPP
activity measured in the cultured astroglia, compared with
that in neurons (Figure 2), cannot be ascribed to proliferative
activity.
When astrocytes were grown in 12 mmol/l glucose and PPP
activity assayed at different glucose concentrations, the rate
of decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose was lower or higher
when the glucose level in the assay medium was less than or
exceeded that in the culture medium respectively (Figure 3A).
On the other hand, the decarboxylation rate of [6-14C]glucose
was quite low and not altered by differences in glucose level
the assay compared with growth media (Figure 3B). Both
[1-14C]glucose decarboxylation and PPP rates were linearly
related to glucose level in the assay medium (Figures 3A­3C).
To summarize, acute changes in glucose concentration in the
assay medium compared with the culture medium cause
parallel changes in glucose utilization rate (Figure 1B) and
Figure 1 Effects of D-glucose concentration on rate of [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation in astroglia grown (A) or assayed (B) in
different concentrations of D-glucose
Glucose utilization rates were assayed with [14C]deoxyglucose in astrocytes chronically exposed to different glucose levels for 10
days, then assayed in 2 mmol/l D-glucose (A) or cultured in 12 mmol/l D-glucose for 10 days, then assayed at the indicated D-glucose
concentration (B). Increasing the glucose concentration in the assay medium elicited statistically significant increases in the rates of
glucose phosphorylation; the continuous line is the linear regression: y50.0463x+1.8575 (r250.991) (B). Note that rates of glucose
phosphorylation were calculated based on the specific activity of [14C]deoxyglucose (i.e. mBq of [14C]deoxyglucose/mmol of glucose)
in the assay medium and do not include a factor for the lumped constant, so the actual rates of glucose phosphorylation would be
higher than the calculated values (see the Results section). Values are means¡S.D. for four to six wells (numbers in parentheses);

PPP rate (Figure 3C). This finding has important implications
for interpretation of results of metabolic assays in cultured
cells because cells are often grown in higher glucose levels
than those used for in vitro assays using radiolabelled
substrates (i.e. to maximize the specific activity and
sensitivity of the assay), and large changes in glucose level
in the assay system can cause artifactual changes in glucose
utilization and pathway fluxes.
Cultured endothelial cells (Brownlee, 2001, 2005), astro-
cytes (Gandhi et al., 2010 and references cited therein) and
other cell types grown in media containing high glucose for
various periods of time ranging from 2­3 days to 3­4 weeks
are used as models for experimental diabetes mellitus. PPP
activity was, therefore compared in astroglia grown in media
containing 5 or 23 mmol/l glucose, and then assayed in
reaction mixtures containing 2 or 20 mmol/l glucose. When
astroglia were cultured in a high-glucose environment
(23 mmol/l glucose) for 10 days, PPP rates were statistically
significantly enhanced compared with cells grown in 5 mmol/
l glucose when measured in assay medium containing either
2 or 20 mmol/l glucose (Figure 4). The predominant ef-
fect increased rate of decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose,
with small, if any, changes in rates of decarboxylation of
[6-14C]glucose with chronic or acute differences in glucose
level (Figure 4). PPP rates were much higher when assayed
in 20 mmol/l compared with 2 mmol/l glucose, regardless of
the growth medium glucose level, and growth in high
glucose and assay in high glucose evoked the highest PPP
activity (Figure 4). Acute changes in glucose concentration
had a greater effect of PPP activity than prolonged ex-
posure to high glucose (Figure 4). These findings dem-
onstrate that acute upward or downward shifts in glucose
concentration cause PPP activity to fall or rise (Figures 3
and 4) in parallel with changes glucose phosphorylation
rate (Figure 1).
Influence of acute or chronic exposure of
astrocytes and neurons to different glucose
levels on ROS generation and on level of GSH in
astrocytes
Prolonged exposure of cultured astrocytes to 25 mmol/l
glucose increases ROS production (Gandhi et al., 2010), and
the present study evaluated ROS production in astrocytes
and neurons during acute changes in glucose concentration.
Astroglia and neurons were grown in 12 mmol/l glucose for
10 or 7­8 days respectively and then assayed for ROS
production in different glucose concentrations. In astroglia,
ROS production decreased by approximately 85% when
acutely exposed to 20 mmol/l glucose compared with
2 mmol/l glucose (Figure 5A). In contrast, ROS production
was higher in neurons than in astroglia and it increased as the
D-glucose concentration was elevated (100, 115 and 145% at
2, 10 and 20 mmol/l glucose respectively) (Figure 5B). Thus,
neurons are more sensitive to acute variations in glucose level
than astroglia, consistent with greater neuronal sensitivity to
other treatments that evoke oxidative stress (e.g. Ben-Yoseph
et al., 1996a, 1996b; Garci
´a-Nogales et al., 2003). Neither
mixed cultures of neurons and astroglia (Figure 6A) nor
neurons grown on an astroglial cell layer (Figure 6B) showed
statistically significant alterations in ROS production with
increased glucose level, despite the fact that neurons alone
responded to acutely increasing concentrations of D-glucose
by elevated ROS production. These results suggest that
astrocytes convey protection to neurons against acute high-
glucose-induced oxidative stress.
PPP activation by acute exposure to 20 mmol/l glucose
occurred in astrocytes grown in either 5 or 23 mmol/l, with a
higher PPP response in the cells grown in 23 mmol/l glucose
medium (Figure 4). In spite of the large differences in PPP
activities in the low- and high-glucose cultures, the ROS
levels assayed in the same glucose level were similar in the

astrocytes cultured in either 5 or 23 mmol/l glucose (Table 2).
In other words, ROS production in astroglia cultured in a
high-glucose medium did not show a significant reduction
compared with that in astroglia cultured in a low-glucose
medium, even though PPP activity was higher. These findings
are unexpected, because astroglia that had been cultured in
high-glucose environment (23 mmol/l) shows higher PPP
rates at 2 and 20 mmol/l (Figure 4). We speculated that
increases in AGE in astroglia that had been cultured in high-
glucose environment (23 mmol/l) might have opposing

influence on ROS production. Therefore we also performed
immunohistochemical analysis of Ne-(carboxyethyl)lysine, one of
major AGE, in astroglia (see Figure 11 and the Discussion section).
Acutely altering glucose concentrations also modulated the
GSH content in astroglia. There was a tendency for GSH to be
lower when assayed in 2 mmol/l glucose compared with
10 mmol/l and GSH was significantly higher when assayed in
20 mmol/l glucose compared with 2 mmol/l (Table 3). L-
buthionine sulfoximine reduces the synthesis of glutathione
by inhibiting c-glutamylcysteine synthase, and incubation
of astroglia with this drug for 48 h markedly reduced GSH
content, but the glucose concentration dependence of
GSH level was still evident (Table 3). These findings suggest
that the higher PPP activity regenerates GSH and can
maintain higher GSH levels even when oxidative stress is
higher. Taken together, all of the above findings indicate that
chronically elevated glucose levels enhance PPP activity, and
acute increases in glucose level stimulate both glucose
utilization and PPP activity to minimize ROS production and
sustain levels of GSH in astroglia that serve a protective role
for neurons exposed to acute glucose-evoked oxidative stress.
Chronic high-glucose environments induce ER
stress, trigger nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and
up-regulate PPP activity
PPP activity in astroglia is known to be regulated by the Nrf2-
mediated transcription of G6PDH (Thimmulappa et al., 2002),
so the underlying mechanisms that regulate PPP activity in
the presence of chronic high-glucose environments were
explored. First, the effect of sulforaphane, an Nrf2 activator,
on PPP activity in astroglia was examined to confirm that the
Nrf2-mediated regulatory system of the PPP was active in our
cultured astroglia. PPP activity doubled in astroglia after 15 h

of treatment with 10 mmol/l sulforaphane (Figure 7A).
Secondly, we examined whether ER stress induces PPP
activation. Nrf2 is reportedly a direct substrate of PERK
(double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER
kinase), an ER stress transducer protein kinase, and the pho-
sphorylation of Nrf2 facilitates its dissociation from the
adaptor protein Keap1 and its translocation to the nucleus
(Surh et al., 2008; Vargas and Johnson, 2009). Thapsigargin (1
mmol/l), a well-established inducer of ER stress (Rasheva and
Domingos, 2009), elicited PPP activation in astroglia after
15 h (Figure 7B). Sulforaphane increased decarboxylation of
[1-14C]glucose without altering glucose oxidation in the
tricarboxylic acid cycle (Figure 7A), whereas thapsigargin
increased decarboxylation of [1-14C]glucose and reduced that
of [6-14C]glucose (Figure 7B). Importantly, these two pathways
were not activated in neuronal cells. Sulforaphane (Figure 7C)
and thapsigargin (Figure 7D) reduced rates of oxidation of
[1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose and also suppressed PPP
activities in neurons without affecting the morphology of the
neurons after 15 h of exposure to these drugs (data not shown),
indicating that the lack of PPP activation was not due to gross
neuronal cell damage.
It is well known that high-glucose environments can induce
N-acetylglucosamine synthesis through an increased flux into
the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which leads to
abnormal glycosylation of proteins and triggers ER stress
(Brownlee, 2001, 2004). This pathway involves conversion of
the glycolytic intermediate fructose 6-phosphate into gluco-
samine 6-phosphate, followed by its acetylation to generate N-
acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate that subsequently enters the
glycosylation pathways. We hypothesized that the hexosamine
pathway plays an important role in the regulation of the PPP in
astroglia and measured the PPP activities after incubation for
15 h with D-glucosamine (1­10 mmol/l), a precursor of the
hexosamine pathway. D-glucosamine did, indeed, induce PPP
activation in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 8).
First, we examined the effects of sulforaphane, thapsigar-
gin and D-glucosamine on expression of BiP, an ER stress
marker, and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were assessed in
cultured astroglia. Fifteen hours of exposure to low-glucose
(5 mmol/l) medium plus sulforaphane caused the transloca-
tion of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nucleus without inducing
BiP expression (compare Figure 9B with control Figure 9A).
Both thapsigargin (Figure 9C) and D-glucosamine (Figure 9D)
induced BiP expression and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2.
Next, the influence of low- and high-glucose environments
on expression of BiP and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were
assessed in cultured astroglia. Elevation of D-glucose
concentration from 5 to 10 or 20 mmol/l for 15 h induced
Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus and increased BiP
expression at 10 and 20 mmol/l of glucose (Figure 10),
indicating that high glucose stimulates the pathway that
enhances G6PDH mRNA transcription and causes ER stress,
presumably via the hexosamine pathway. Because treatment
with sulforaphane and thapsigargin (Figures 7A and 7B) and
D-glucosamine (Figure 8) increased the PPP activity in
astroglia, ROS production rates were also assessed after
15 h of incubation with sulforaphane, thapsigargin and
D-glucosamine (Table 4). All treatments reduced ROS pro-
duction compared with control conditions and enhanced the
PPP activity (Table 4). Together, these findings indicate that
ROS production in astroglia is regulated by Keap1/Nrf2-
dependent PPP activation. We also observed that long-term
culture (6 weeks) in high-glucose medium (23 mmol/l)
enhanced immunostaining of AGEs as compared with short-
term culture (3 weeks) in high-glucose medium (23 mmol/l)
or in low-glucose medium (5 mmol/l) for both 3 and 6 weeks
(Figure 11).

DISCUSSION
The major findings of the present study are that both acute
and chronic exposure to high-glucose environments enhanced
the PPP activities, thereby controlling glucose-evoked ROS
production in cultured rat astroglia through different and co-
operative mechanisms. In contrast, ROS production rises in
cultured neurons under high-glucose conditions, and the PPP
in neurons does not respond to conditions that up-regulate
PPP in astrocytes. However, neurons are protected against
oxidative stress evoked by acute increases in glucose level by
co-culture with astrocytes. These actions of astroglia indicate a
potential protective role against oxidative stress in the brain
under the hyperglycaemic conditions associated with diabetes
mellitus. As shown in Figures 6(A) and 6(B), these roles of
astroglia seem to be independent of cultivation period (1 week
versus 4 weeks), developmental stage in vivo (embryonic day

16 versus newborn) or regions of the brain (striatum versus
cerebral cortex) in accordance with our previous report that
showed similar metabolic properties of glucose in cultured
astroglia prepared from striata of fetal rats on embryonic day
16 (Abe et al., 2006b). Notably, if astroglia are acutely shifted
to a lower glucose concentration compared with that in the
assay medium, the PPP rate is down-regulated and ROS levels
increase, suggesting increased vulnerability of brain cells to
oxidative stress during transient episodes of reduced glucose
level that are normally adequate to support brain function
(i.e. 2 mmol/l) or transitory hypoglycaemia that is commonly
experienced by diabetic patients.
In addition to their clinically relevant implications, the
results of this study reveal important issues related to in vitro
metabolic assays. The sensitivity of changes in astroglial
glucose metabolism, pathway fluxes and ROS generation in
response to extracellular glucose concentrations needs to be
taken into account when designing experimental procedures
for in vitro metabolic assays and assays that may be sensitive
to oxidative stress in cultured cells. Also, the consequences of
(i) cyclic changes of glucose concentrations as a result of perio-
dic change of culture media (i.e. feeding astroglial cells), (ii)
culture of astrocytes and neurons in media containing
extremely high glucose concentrations (.15­20 mmol/l) that
greatly exceed glucose levels in diabetic rat brain (5­7 mmol/g;
Gandhi et al., 2010) and (iii) the progressive depletion of
glucose from culture medium that is not changed in order to
minimize neuronal damage or death that can arise from
medium change need to be taken into account when inter-
preting results.
Acutely increasing concentrations of D-glucose increased
the glycolytic flux into the PPP, enhancing decarboxylation at
carbon 1 of D-glucose, as evidenced by the increase in
[1-14C]glucose-derived 14CO2
production. A slight but defi-
nite decrease in [6-14C]glucose-derived 14CO2
production
indicated that astroglial mitochondrial oxidative phos-
phorylation in the tricarboxylic acid cycle was suppressed
(Figure 3B), whereas glucose utilization increased, as assessed
by the rates of [14C]deoxyglucose phosphorylation
(Figure 1B). The overall rate of brain glucose utilization is
regulated in an integrated, complex manner by various
regulatory metabolites at many steps, including at the initial
step in glycolytic pathway, the phosphorylation of glucose
to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase, as well as at many
downstream sites, especially, phosphofructokinase (the major
regulatory enzyme), pyruvate kinase, PDH (pyruvate dehy-
drogenase) and tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenases. PPP
fluxes are governed by NADP availability due to consumption
of NADPH to regenerate GSH from GSSG as the cell manages
oxidative stress (Dringen et al., 2007). Nitric oxide and
peroxynitrite also strongly activate the PPP (Garci
´a-Nogales
et al., 2003), as do various neurotransmitters that are
metabolized by monoamine oxidase and generate H2
O2
(e.g. Appel and Parrot, 1970; Ben-Yoseph et al., 1996a,
1996b and cited references). Brain hexokinase has a low Km
value (approximately 0.05 mmol/l), compared with the
glucokinase with a high Km
that is typically found in the
liver and is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate, as is
hexokinase (Grossbard and Schimke, 1966). As a result,
hexokinase is saturated at glucose concentrations above
1 mmol/l, consistent with the fact that CMRglc
does not
increase in response to acute hyperglycaemia in vivo (Orzi
et al., 1988; Schuier et al., 1990). There is evidence for the
existence of glucokinase activity in the brain (Roncero et al.,
2000, 2004, 2009; Alvarez et al., 2002) and its presence in
cultured astrocytes is not ruled out.
Our previous report, showing that chronic high-glucose
environments reduced astroglial oxidative metabolism of
glucose (Abe et al., 2006a) might have some relevance to
results of the present study. Chronic high-glucose environ-
ments also increased PPP activities in astroglia, while glucose
utilization (as assessed using [14C]deoxyglucose phosphoryla-
tion measured at 2 mmol/l glucose) was not altered
(Figure 1A). Importantly, the PPP activities in astroglia that
had been cultured at 23 mmol/l glucose for 10 days were
higher than those in astroglia cultured at 5 mmol/l for
10 days measured at either 2 or 20 mmol/l glucose (Figure 4).
These results indicate that chronic high-glucose environ-
ments enhance PPP activities preserving the dependence of
PPP activities on glucose concentrations. Therefore some
additional mechanisms may act to elevate the PPP activities
at any concentration of D-glucose. To explore the underlying
mechanisms, we focused on the transcriptional regulation of
G6PDH, a rate-liming enzyme of the PPP.
The G6PDH gene is known to possess an antioxidant
response element and the Keap1/Nrf2 system stimulates
G6PDH transcription under stressed conditions and this
response is quite rapid (i.e. within 24 h) (Thimmulappa
et al., 2002). Nrf2 is a transcriptional factor that is kept in
the cytosol under unstressed conditions, forming a complex
with Keap1, an anchor protein bound to the cytoskeleton. The
Keap1­Nrf2 complex is constantly degraded by the protea-
some system; thus, the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 is
suppressed under normal physiological environments (Surh
et al., 2008; Vargas and Johnson, 2009). At least two different
triggers are known to facilitate Nrf2 translocation from the
cytosol to the nucleus to bind the antioxidant response
element. One trigger is a modification of thiol residues in the
Keap1­protein, typically as a result of an increase in ROS
(Surh et al., 2008; Vargas and Johnson, 2009). Sulforaphane, a
natural isothionate found in broccoli sprouts, is a potent
activator of Nrf2 (Danilov et al., 2009; Cheung and Kong,
2010; Guerrero-Beltra
´n et al., 2010) and may activate PPP via
this mechanism. Another mechanism is the phosphorylation
of serine residues in the Nrf2 protein (Surh et al., 2008;
Vargas and Johnson, 2009). Several kinases reportedly phos-
phorylate Nrf2 at Ser40 (Bloom, 2003; Surh et al., 2008;
Vargas and Johnson, 2009). Cullinan et al. (2003) reported
that Nrf2 is a direct substrate of PERK, a kinase that acts as a
transducer of ER stress (Rasheva and Domingos, 2009). Thus,
ER stress could trigger the Keap1/Nrf2 system-dependent
transcriptional regulation of type 2 detoxifying enzymes

(Cullinan, 2004; Cullinan and Diehl, 2006; Xu et al., 2010).
First, we confirmed that sulforaphane enhances PPP activity
and Nrf2 translocation without BiP expression, a well-known
ER stress marker (Rasheva and Domingos, 2009) in astroglia.
Secondly, we found that thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer
(Rasheva and Domingos, 2009) did, indeed, enhance BiP
expression, as well as the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, in
astroglia in association with the enhancement of PPP activity
in astroglia.
We found that the PPP activity in astroglia is approxi-
mately 4­5 times higher than that in neurons. The PPP is well
known to be active in proliferating cells because the PPP is
necessary for DNA synthesis (Wamelink et al., 2008). However,
the proliferating activity in astroglia was found to be of no
relevance to the high activity of the PPP observed in cultured
astroglia because mitotic arrest by Ara-C did not affect the
PPP activity. In addition to the measurement of the basal PPP
activity in neurons, we attempted to activate the neuronal
PPP activity using sulforaphane or thapsigargin. Neither of
these agents, however, altered the neuronal PPP activities. The
enhanced activity of PPP in astroglia did, indeed, decrea-
se the rates of ROS production in both astroglial and neuronal
cells when cultured together. Although the measured ROS
production in the fluorimetric system is the sum of the gene-
ration and elimination of the ROS, the observed decreases in
the rate of ROS production in the astroglia may reflect
enhanced elimination or decreased generation. The present
observation that acutely increasing glucose concentrations
elicited increases in GSH content and that these increases were
further suppressed by the addition of L-buthionine sulfox-
imine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis (Table 3) supports
the latter possibility.
In fact, the PPP has been reported to be more active in
astroglia than in neurons (e.g. Ben-Yoseph et al., 1996a,
1996b; Garci
´a-Nogales et al., 2003), as found in the present
study. As mitochondrial respiratory chain is an important
source of ROS in the brain, astroglial glutathione may play a
key role in protecting against neuronal damage caused by
ROS. GSH in astroglia is reportedly released into the
extracellular space to reduce ROS and is then transferred to
neurons for protection. Acute hyperglycaemia increases ROS
production in the endothelium (Nishikawa et al,. 2000;
Brownlee, 2001, 2005), and the neuronal cultures in our assay
also exhibited the enhanced production of ROS under acutely
increasing glucose concentrations. In contrast, the ROS
production in astroglia was reduced by increases in the
glucose concentrations. Interestingly, in mixed cultures of
neurons and astroglia, the ROS production remained constant
as glucose concentrations were elevated. We speculated that
increases in astroglial GSH may reduce neuronal ROS
production in our cultured system, as reported by Garci
´a-
Nogales et al. (2003). In fact, Asanuma et al. (2010)
demonstrated that zonisamide, which has been used clinically
as an anti-epileptic drug, augments astroglial GSH levels and
resultant increases in cysteine transfer to dopaminergic
neurons confer a novel protective mechanism against neuronal
degeneration through quenching ROS and dopamine quinone
in Parkinson's disease model in vivo.
Finally, we explored the regulatory mechanism of the PPP via
the Keap1/Nrf2 system in the presence of chronic hypergly-
caemia. We focused on hexosamine biosynthetic path-
way in astroglia (Matthews et al.. 2007), because this pathway
is known to produce ER stress (Kline et al., 2006; Sage et al.,
2010) under hyperglycaemic conditions (O
¨ zcan et al., 2004). In
the present study, an intermediate metabolite of the
hexosamine pathway, D-glucosamine, did indeed trigger both
ER stress and Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, and the PPP
activities were enhanced, as evidenced by the results of the
[14C]glucose assay. These actions of D-glucosamine were also
confirmed by dose-dependent decreases in ROS production in
astroglia. In addition, chronic hyperglycaemia induced BiP
expression and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, as evidenced
by the immunohistochemical analyses. Taken together, acute
and chronic hyperglycaemia enhanced the PPP activity using
different but co-operative pathways.
Many clinical observations show that long-term hypergly-
caemia causes vascular diseases (Brownlee, 2001, 2005).
However, the adverse effects of hyperglycaemia on the brain
per se, i.e. diabetic encephalopathy, remain controversial
(Sommerfield et al., 2004; Cox et al., 2005; McCall, 2005;
Ryan, 2006; Manschot et al., 2007; Sima, 2010). One possible
reason may be that the brain possesses a potent protective
mechanism against high-glucose-induced ROS. The present
study provides one possible mechanism by which primarily
the astroglia play a pivotal role in neuroprotection against
ROS under hyperglycaemic conditions. In addition, these
actions of astroglia are dependent on the existence of D-
glucose. These results imply that reducing the glucose
concentrations too rapidly or by too large an extent may
have detrimental effects on the astroglial protective system.
In fact, reducing the blood glucose level during the acute
phase of stroke does not necessarily have a beneficial effect
on stroke mortality and functional recovery. Moreover, the
fluctuation of blood glucose levels, rather than sustained
hyperglycaemia, is reported to be a more potent risk factor
for stroke (Monnier et al., 2006) and dementia, reflecting
brain parenchymal cell damage (Fowler and Vasudevan,
2010).
Astroglia always responds to acutely increasing glucose
concentrations by enhancing PPP rate irrespective of the
culture conditions, but basal PPP rate is higher when cells
were cultured in high glucose. For example, astroglia cultured
for 10 days in a high-glucose environment (23 mmol/l)
exhibited enhanced PPP rate at 2 or 20 mmol/l D-glucose as
compared with PPP rate measured at corresponding D-
glucose concentration in astroglia that had been cultured in a
low-glucose environment (5 mmol/l) (Figure 4). However, the
net production of ROS production by astroglia that had been
cultured in 5 or 23 mmol/l glucose did not differ at 2, 10 and
20 mmol/l respectively (Table 2). These apparently-conflicting
results imply that the enhancement of ROS generation is
overcome under high-glucose environments irrespective of

the enhanced activity of ROS elimination. We speculate that a
non-enzymatic reaction that produces methylglyoxal from
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, another minor pathway of
glucose metabolism, may be involved. Methylglyoxal gen-
erates AGEs that are well-known sources of ROS under a
chronic hyperglycaemic state (Dhar et al., 2008; Lo et al.,
2010). The increased production of methylglyoxal and
resultant increases in ROS production by AGEs in a hyper-
glycaemic state have been reported in the vascular system
(Dhar et al., 2008; Lo et al., 2010). If the adverse effects of
high-glucose environments overcome the astroglial intrinsic
protective mechanism in the long run, they may result in
brain damage. Recent findings that experimental diabetes
increases production of ROS­reactive nitrogen species and
inhibits astrocytic gap junctional communication in tissue
culture and brain slices from streptozotocin-diabetic rats
suggest that astroglial dysfunction does, indeed, occur after
longer period of disease duration irrespective of intrinsic self-
defence mechanisms (Gandhi et al., 2010; Ball et al., 2011).
Also, we observed increased immunostaining of Ne-(carbox-
yethyl)lysine, one of the major AGEs, in astroglia that had been
cultured in 23 mmol/l glucose for 6 weeks (Figure 11), sup-
porting the above possibility. Astroglial dysfunction could be
involved in the pathogenesis of dementia (Biessels et al., 2006;
Xu et al., 2009) or Parkinson's disease (Cereda et al., 2011;
Schernhammer et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011), which have
recently been found to be more common in diabetic patients.
In conclusion, astroglia play a neuroprotective role under acute
and chronic high-glucose conditions, extending the findings of
previous studies related to protective effects of the PPP against
oxidative stress induced by neurotransmitters and neuroregula-
tors and their metabolites. Both of these acute and chronic
conditions depend on an appropriate glucose content; thus,
maintaining glucose concentrations in the proper range is
relevant for the astroglial PPP as a neuroprotective mechanism.
