656 Cerebrovascular Disease Morbidity in the
United States, 1970-1983
Age, Sex, Region, and Vascular Surgery
RICHARD F. GILLUM, M.D.
SUMMARY Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey were reviewed to assess trends in hospital
discharge rates for cerebrovascular disease in the United States between 1970 and 1983. Hospital discharge
rates showed little consistent change during the 1970's but increased after 1979. Hospital case fatality
declined during the same period. Cerebrovascular disease discharge rates were higher among older per-
sons, men, and blacks. Hospital case fatality was higher in older persons and blacks. Rates of cerebral
arteriography and endarterectomy of vessels of the head and neck increased between 1979 and 1983.
Methodologk problems in monitoring cerebrovascular disease trends are reviewed and recommendations
for future research presented.

DEATH RATES for cerebrovascular disease have de-
clined in the United States since at least the 1940's.1'2
This decline continued through 1982 (fig. 1). Several
studies have attributed this to declining incidence with
little change in case fatality of acute stroke.34 Two
studies reported declines in hospitalization rate, an
indicator of stroke occurrence, during the 1970's.3'6 In
this report, data from the National Hospital Discharge
Survey for a ten-year period are presented. These data
show no consistent downward trend in hospital dis-
charge rates for cerebrovascular disease but suggest a
decline in case fatality rates between 1970 and 1983.
In addition, effects of age, sex, race and region are
presented and patterns of utilization of cerebral arteri-
ography and carotid endarterectomy are examined.
Methods
The National Hospital Discharge Survey. As pre-
viously described, the National Hospital Discharge
Survey encompasses patients discharged from nonin-
stitutional hospitals exclusive of Federal hospitals lo-
cated in the 50 States and the District of Columbia.7'8
Included in the list of eligible hospitals are those li-
censed hospitals with at least six beds where the aver-
age length of stay for all patients is less than 30 days.
Hospital discharges are selected for abstracting by a
multi-staged sampling procedure described in detail
elsewhere.7 From a universe of over 8,000 hospitals, a
sample of over 500 is selected each year, of which over
400 consent to participate and meet eligibility criteria.
Within hospitals, the daily listing sheet of discharges
was the frame from which subsamples of discharges
were selected. Probabilities of selection at each stage
of sampling are known so that estimates of national
statistics may be obtained. Depending on the study
procedure agreed on with the hospital administrator,
either hospital staffs orrepresentativesof the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) performed the

sample selection and the transcription of information
from the hospital record face sheet to abstract forms.
The medical information recorded on the sample pa-
tients' abstracts was coded centrally by NCHS staff.
Between 1970 and 1978, a maximum of five codes for
discharge diagnoses was assigned. Starting in 1979 a
maximum of seven codes was assigned. The Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases 9th Revision Clinical
Modification (ICD 9 CM) was the coding system used
for diagnoses starting in 1979. A modification of the
International Classification of Diseases Adapted
(ICDA), 8th Revision, was used from 1968 through
1978.
Less than 1 percent of the dischargerecordsfailed to
include age or sex of patient. However, race was not
stated for about 13 percent of all discharges. If the
hospital record did not state age or sex of patient, it was
imputed by assigning the patient age or sex consistent
with age or sex of other patients with the same diagnos-
tic codes. In 1981 only, a specific race was imputed for
those discharges for which race was not stated on the
medical record face sheet.8 Race was imputed using
both the distribution of race in the geographic area of
the hospital as reported by the Bureau of Census and
information on diagnosis and expected source of pay-
ment for those records for which race was imputed.
This procedure was not continued in 1982 and 1983
due to technical difficulties. Procedures for calculating
sampling errors are described in detail elsewhere. Rel-
ative standard errors for estimates calculated from Na-
tional Hospital Discharge Survey data have been pub-
lished in graph form.8
For patients aged 45 years or over, the following
discharge diagnoses were enumerated: cerebrovascu-
lar disease (ICD 430-438). In these analyses, the first-
listed (principal) diagnosis was used. This was done to
avoid counting the same hospitalization multiple times
since patients are given often more than one of the
codes from 430-438. Hospital discharge rates using
all-listed diagnoses are approximately twice as high as
rates using onlyfirst-listeddiagnoses. In addition, all-
listed discharges having cerebral arteriography (ICD 9
CM 88.41) or head and neck vessel endarterectomy
(ICD 9 CM 38.12) were enumerated for 1979-1983.

mates were taken from publications of the United
States Bureau of the Census or from estimates obtained
from the Bureau of the Census (1982 and 1983).'
Race-specific rates were computed for 1981 only. Be-
cause of the much larger percent of cases with missing
race than for other imputed variables, caution should
be used in drawing conclusions from the data by race.
Hospital case fatality was computed as follows: the
number of discharges with discharge status coded dead
was divided by the total number of discharges with
cerebrovascular disease. This is a conservative esti-
mate since those with discharge status coded "nonstat-
ed" are assumed to be alive at discharge. However, it
includes deaths from co-morbid conditions.
Results
Trends
No downward trends in rates of discharge of patients
with first-listed diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease
appeared during this period except for persons 65 years
and over between 1974 and 1978 (fig. 2). However,
when rates for 1970 to 1973 were considered, there
was no net change among older persons. In contrast to
the appearance of little change during the 1970's, a
definite upward trend in rates was seen between 1979
and 1983 for both young and old. Hospital case fatality
rates declined over the period (fig. 3). The change was
seen both among older and younger persons.
Several technical problems complicate the inter-
pretation of these trends. In 1979, the number of ab-
stracted diagnoses coded was increased from a maxi-
mum of 5 to 7. In addition, the comparability ratio
between ICDA (1970-1978) and ICD 9 (1979-1983)
for codes 43(M38 is (ICDA-8/ICD-9-CM) 0.93
(NCHS, unpublished data). This most likely explains
the upward discontinuity in discharge rates seen be-
tween 1979 and 1978 especially among older persons.
Hence trends should be examined within each ICD
time period. A further problem is that the universe of
hospitals sampled was updated and new hospitals were
added to the sample in 1972, 1975, 1977, 1979 and
1981 .* As a result, the estimated number of discharges
jumped in some of these years, tending to raise the
rates and offset any decline.
Age
Hospital discharge rates for persons 65 years and
over are over five times those for persons 45-64 years
(fig. 2). Hospital case fatality rates, however, were
about 50 percent higher in persons 65 years and over as
compared to persons under age 65 (fig. 3).
Sex
Men had somewhat higher cerebrovascular disease
hospitalization rates than women in both age groups
(fig. 2), the difference being greatest in those 45-64
years (sex ratio about 1.5). There were no substantial
sex differences in trends of hospital discharge rates.
Race
The age-adjusted hospital discharge rates by race
for persons 35-74 years of age in 1981 were: blacks,
652 per 100,000; whites, 483 per 100,000. Hence, the
rate for first-listed diagnoses for blacks was 1.3 times
that for whites. For persons over 75, there was little
difference between rates in blacks (3540 per 100,000)
and whites (3438 per 100,000). At ages 45-64, case
fatality was over twice as high for men and 60 percent
higher for women in blacks compared to whites. Over
65, the black excess fatality was 15 percent for men
and 27 percent for women. However, these fatality
data must be interpreted with caution because of the
small number of blacks in the sample and resulting
large standard error for subgroup estimates.
Region
Throughout the period the Midwest region had the
highest overall discharge rates for cerebrovascular dis-
65+ years

ease with the exception of 1977 and 1978 when the
South had slightly higher rates. The West region had
the lowest rates in all years except 1983 when the
Northeast region had slightly lower rates. Rates of the
Midwest region were generally about 20 percent high-
er than those of the west. These differences may vary
by age. In 1983, rates for persons 45-64 years were
highest in the Midwest (484 per 100,000), followed by
the South (427), West (379) and Northeast (353).
However, rates for persons 65 and over were highest in
the West (2,647) followed by the Midwest (2,432),
South (2,350) and Northeast (2,001). Lists of states in
each region are available in U.S. government publica-
tions.7' '
Cerebral Arteriography and Endarterectomy
Only ICD 9 CM permitted detailed examination of
both these procedures. Rates of cerebral arteriography
increased steadily between 1979 and 1983. For per-
sons 45-64 years of age, the rate of all-listed proce-
dures increased from 97 per 100,000 in 1979 to 130 per
100,000 in 1983 (34 percent). For persons 65 years of
age and over, rates increased from 123 per 100,000 to
259 per 100,000 (111 percent). Similar trends were
observed for endarterectomy of vessels of the head and
neck (carotid artery). Rates increased from 45 to 56 per
100,000 among persons 45-64 years (24 percent) and
from 131 to 252 per 100,000 among persons 65 years
and over (92 percent) between 1979 and 1983. Cere-
bral arteriography was about twice as common among
older persons whereas rates of endarterectomy were
more than three times higher among older persons as
compared to persons 45-64 years. Rates of both in
men were 30 to 50 percent higher than in women. In
1981, the age-adjusted rate of cerebral angiography
was equal in blacks and whites aged 35 to 74 years.
However, the rate of endarterectomy among blacks
was only 40 percent that of whites.
Discussion
In the National Hospital Discharge Survey, cerebro-
vascular disease hospitalization rates showed little
change during the 1970's but increased after 1979.
Hospital case fatality declined during the same period.
Cerebrovascular disease discharge rates were higher
among older persons, men, blacks and persons in the
Midwest region. Patterns by age and sex are consistent
with patterns of cerebrovascular disease mortality.
However, time trends are not consistent with the
marked downward trends in cerebrovascular disease
mortality.1 However, the absolute and relative rate of
mortality decline between 1979 and 1982 was less than
between 1971 and 1975. The black-to-white ratio of
hospitalization rates is somewhat lower than what
would be expected from mortality ratios.1 Further, the
very low rates of endarterectomy and the equivalent
rates of cerebral arteriography among blacks as com-
pared to whites are not consistent with patterns of
mortality or morbidity.1' 10~14 However, caution must
be used in interpreting the race-specific data due to the
large percent with race imputed. Mortality and preva-
lence data would lead one to expect the highest hospi-
talization rates in the South followed by the Midwest
region.14'l5
Other published studies of cerebrovascular disease
hospitalization and case fatality generally reported de-
clining hospitalization rates and stable case fatality for
initial stroke. The National Survey of Strokereporteda
14 percent decline in hospitalized initial stroke rates
for persons aged 35 to 74 but an increase in recurrent
stroke resulting in little change in overall rates in the
coterminous United States between 1971 and 1976.5

Rates of initial stroke for persons under 65 did not
decrease, consistent with the present results. Over the
period, 73.8 percent of patients had initial stroke and
26.2 percent had recurrent stroke. There were no
"gross secular changes in patient survival for the six
years study period."16 In the Minneapolis/St. Paul met-
ropolitan area, hospitalization rates for acute stroke
were lower in 1980 than in 1970 but there was no
significant difference in hospital case fatality except
for men 30-64 years of age.6 In Rochester, Minnesota,
incidence of a first stroke declined between 1970-74
and 1975-79 by 27 percent in persons aged 55-64
years and by 13 percent in persons aged 65-74 years.3
Almost no change in 30 day survivorship occurred
between these periods for all ages.4 A previous report
has documented the steady increase in the number of
endarterectomies for disease of the extracranial arter-
ies of the head and neck since 1971.17
The reasons for the apparent recent upturn in Na-
tional Hospital Discharge Survey hospitalization rates
and decline in hospital case fatality for cerebrovascular
disease are unclear. Decreasing incidence with stable
survivorship, as reported in other studies, should lead
to decreasing hospitalization rates and stable hospital
case fatality. However, detection of milder strokes by
computerized tomography and increased rates of elec-
tive hospitalization for cerebral angiography and en-
darterectomy might be contributing factors to in-
creased hospitalization and decreased fatality rates.
Increased hospitalization of recurrent acute strokes
would increase both hospitalization rates and case fa-
tality. Increased hospitalization of patients with chron-
ic cerebrovascular disease would increase hospitali-
zation rates with variable effect on case fatality.
Subgroups of codes used to indicate acute thrombotic
or hemorrhagic stroke in one published surveillance
study6 constituted about 80 percent of all cerebrovas-
cular disease (ICD 430-438) discharges for persons
45-64 years of age and about 90 percent of discharges
of persons 65 years and over in the National Hospital
Discharge Survey during 1979-1983, the period when
ICD 9 CM was used. The corresponding percentages
were about 75 percent of younger and about 85 percent
of older patients during 1974-1978, the period of
ICDA, suggesting little change in the proportion of
chronic cerebrovascular disease. No national data are
available that permit accurate assessment of trends in
cerebrovascular disease prevalence, a major determi-
nant of hospital utilization. However, data from the
U.S. Health Interview Survey suggest an increase in
prevalence of cerebrovascular disease reported in
health interviews for both sexes at ages 45-64 and 65
and over between 1972 and 1977. "·M-l8 This finding is
consistent with an effect of declining national case
fatality (fig. 3). Further studies are needed to deter-
mine how much of the apparent discrepancy in trends
between national discharge data and data from various
localities is due to methodologic considerations.
Several previous papers have discussed methodo-
logic problems in community surveillance of trends in
cerebrovascular disease, mortality and morbidity.19"23
Similar problems may affect both national and local
studies. These problems occur in studies regardless of
whether the sampling fractions of hospitals and of dis-
charges are 100 percent (as in many smaller studies) or
much less than 100 percent (as in the National Hospital
Discharge Survey). Cases of cerebrovascular disease
treated at home or in institutions cannot be detected
while those dying out of hospital may be detected by
death certificate.6 Estimation of acute cerebrovascular
disease hospitalization rates is made difficult by sever-
al problems. Noncooperation of hospitals selected to
be sampled is a significant problem. For example, the
sample of the National Hospital Discharge Survey for
1981 consisted of 550 hospitals. Of these, 71 refused
to participate and 51 were out of scope either because
the hospital had gone out of business or because it
failed to meet the definition of a short-stay hospital.8
To produce unbiased national estimates, an adjustment
for nonresponse was made as a component of the esti-
mation procedure. There is difficulty in establishing an
accurate sampling frame especially in retrospective
studies of years prior to 1979. Many hospitals have
closed or merged and may have changed record num-
bering systems, making sampling difficult. New hos-
pitals have opened during the period of interest. Thus
frequent updating of the hospital sample universe is
necessary.7 Although much less in recent years, vari-
ation in hospital systems of discharge data retrieval
may make sampling difficult because of lacking data
on age, residence, year of discharge, discharge status
or discharge codes in a form suitable for easy sam-
pling. Fortunately, most hospitals can provide data as
computer printouts or computer tapes rather than as file
cards or other difficult formats.
Other problems relate to the lack of reliability of
information on medical record discharge sheets. Stud-
ies by the Institute of Medicine have indicated that this
problem is considerable and varies greatly by dis-
charge diagnosis and type of data abstracted.24-26 There
is a substantial lack of reliability in the designation of a
diagnosis as principal and the assumption that the first-
listed diagnosis is the principal is fraught with difficul-
ty. It is clearly appropriate toreportwhether first-listed
(principal) or all-listed diagnoses is used in any pub-
lished reports. The introduction of diagnosis-related-
groups and prospective payment in 1983 may affect the
frequency of cerebrovascular disease codes, further
complicating the study of trends over time. For estima-
tion of rates of acute thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke
resulting from hypertension or arteriosclerosis, exactly
which of the codes 430-438 are most appropriate is not
clear.5'6 If resources are limited, one of the subsets of
codes used in two large published studies may be
adopted.56 Separation of initial acute stroke from re-
current admissions for acute stroke or for late compli-
cations of stroke is probably not possible based on
information on the discharge sheet alone. Even using
first-listed diagnosis, a single patient might be counted
more than once in a given year by the National Hospi-
tal Discharge Survey, if there were multiple discharges
with codes 430-438 from a sampled hospital. Once the

sample is finally selected, the desired charts may be
missing from the medical record room. Further, race
and other important demographic or other data may be
missing from the face sheet (or even from the chart as a
whole). This is a particularly severe problem in studies
like the National Hospital Discharge Survey in which
the protocol precludes searching the body of a chart for
information not listed on the discharge sheet. Such
problems may extend even to coding of discharge stat-
us as alive or dead.8
Another problem is the validity of discharge diag-
noses quite apart from the reliability of their abstract-
ing and coding.21"24 In the Nationwide Study of Stroke,
1846 (68.1 percent) of 2,710 cases with discharge
ICDA codes 430-438 and 436 could be confirmed as
acute stroke.5 Of the 864 not confirmed, 383 had prob-
able transient ischemic attack, 223 had old stroke and
106 were transferred to another hospital. In a Minneso-
ta study, about half of abstracted cases met strict crite-
ria for acute stroke.6 Even studies with the resources
needed to attempt validation of discharges through re-
view of hospital, clinical and laboratory data face con-
siderable problems in this regard. Even with detailed
review of medical records by trained nurses or clini-
cians, pertinent variables in the medical history, phys-
ical examination and laboratory examination including
computerized axial tomography, lumbar puncture, and
isotopic brain scans may be inconsistently obtained or
recorded on substantial proportions of the cases. Fur-
ther, the development and application of diagnostic
criteria suitable for such a data set is problematic.5'"
This is particularly true when trends over substantial
periods of time are assessed. Innovations in diagnostic
technology make it difficult to establish the compara-
bility of cases overtime. For example, the introduction
of computerized axial tomography (CAT scanning) in
the late 1970's may have resulted in more cases being
diagnosed as acute stroke as compared to earlier
times.3 The rate of CAT scans of the head among
patients discharged from U.S. hospitals tripled be-
tween 1979 and 1982.28 The detection of small infarcts
or hemorrhages would substantially alter the case mix
and hence the case fatality.4 This makes it difficult to
find a common set of criteria which can be uniformly
applied across long periods of time. A further problem
for studies which attempt to approximate incidence is
the unknown validity and reliability of the history of
previous cerebrovascular disease as abstracted from
the hospital record.
Much methodologic research is needed to improve
the methods for monitoring trends in cerebrovascular
disease mortality and morbidity. Further analysis of
data from ongoing3'6-w and past5' '·10 surveillance stud-
ies may provide much needed information. Despite
these problems researchers should routinely exploit
existing data resources such as those of the National
Center for Health Statistics and its National Hospital
Discharge Survey,7'8 National Institute of Neurologi-
cal and Communicative Disorders and Stroke,3'28 the
Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities,
the Health Care Financing Administration (Medicare),
and the Veterans Administration especially when plan-
ning epidemiologic studies. Regional or state planning
organizations and local professional standards review
organizations or hospital associations may also have
valuable data. In analysis of data and reporting of data
from these sources or from special studies, researchers
should examine age-, sex-and race- specific data.
To further elucidate the causes and effects of the
decline in stroke mortality, simultaneous monitoring
of stroke incidence, recurrence, prevalence and case
fatality rates adjusted for severity is needed. Long-
term survivorship after acute stroke should be as-
sessed. The few studies that have determined the prev-
alence and incidence of cerebrovascular disease in
black populations have found higher prevalence and
incidence in blacks than whites, especially among
women.10-'3'M Data is lacking on trends of stroke hos-
pitalization and case fatality in the black population.
Strategies are needed to reduce the percent of medical
records with missing race and introduce better tech-
niques for routine imputation of race in national data
sets. Studies should also be done to determine whether
blacks have access to diagnostic and therapeutic fa-
cilities for cerebrovascular disease appropriate for
their high incidence and mortality. Population-based
studies of vascular pathology of stroke in blacks com-
pared to whites are needed to confirm reports suggest-
ing that the low rates of carotid endarterectomy may be
due to a preponderance of intracranial occlusion in
blacks.10'3I-n Many methodologic problems remain to
be solved to facilitate such research. Meanwhile ef-
forts aimed at primary prevention of cerebrovascular
disease through hypertension control should be vigor-
ously continued.
