from food sources1­4

ABSTRACT
Background: Dietary supplement use is extensive in US adults. Some
reports suggested that supplement users had higher nutrient intakes
from the diet than did nonusers, but to our knowledge this finding has
not been examined in nationally representative survey data.
Objective: In this analysis, we examined mineral intakes from the
diet by supplement-use categories and how these supplements con-
tributed to meeting or exceeding Dietary Reference Intakes for
selected minerals.
Design: Data from adults (19 y of age; n = 8860) who participated
in NHANES 2003­2006, a nationally representative, cross-sectional
survey, were examined. Supplement use was defined as the partic-
ipant's self-reported use of a supplement that contained one or more
selected minerals.
Results: Dietary intakes of minerals from food sources were higher
for magnesium, copper, potassium, and selenium in male supplement
users than in nonusers. For women, dietary intakes of minerals from
food sources were higher for users than for nonusers for each mineral
examined except for selenium. In women, users of calcium-containing
dietary supplements were much more likely to meet the Estimated
Average Requirement (EAR) than were nonusers. Even after consid-
eration of supplement use, .14% of adults had inadequate intakes for
calcium and magnesium on the basis of the percentage of adults with
usual intakes less than the EAR. The prevalence of adults who ex-
ceeded the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for calcium, zinc, iron,
and magnesium was higher in users than in nonusers.
Conclusions: Individuals who used mineral-containing dietary
supplements had higher mineral intakes from food sources in the
diet than did nonusers. For all minerals examined, and particularly
for calcium and magnesium in men and women and iron in
women, supplement use decreased the prevalence of intake inad-
equacy for each respective mineral; however, supplements contrib-
uted to risk of potentially excessive intakes for calcium, iron, zinc,
and magnesium. Am J Clin Nutr 2011;94:1376­81.
INTRODUCTION
Dietary supplement use is pervasive in the United States, with
about one-half of adults and more than one-third of children and
adolescents who have reported the use of dietary supplement (1,
2). In adults, it has been well documented that older adults
consume more dietary supplements than do younger adults (1, 3,
4). Dietary supplement users also tend to be women (3, 5), less
likely to smoke (6, 7), leaner (3, 5), and more physically active (3,
7) than are nonusers. Furthermore, dietary supplement users have
higher levels of educational attainment and socioeconomic status
than do nonusers (5, 8). Dietary habits of supplement users may
also differ from those of nonusers; eg, supplement users have
higher intakes of fruit and vegetables (3, 6) and drink more wine
(5) than do nonusers.
Some (3, 9) but not all (10) reports suggested that adult users
have higher intakes of nutrients from their diets than do nonusers.
The prevalence of inadequate total micronutrient intakes (diet
plus supplements) is lower in adults who use supplements than in
adults who do not use supplements (9, 11, 12). However, total
micronutrient intakes of users of supplements may be in excess of
UL5 recommendations for certain nutrients because of the large
amounts of nutrients contributed by dietary supplements (5).
Very little is known about differences in mineral intakes of users
and nonusers of supplements in nationally representative survey
data (13). It is important for the development of public health
policy to understand whether individuals who take dietary
supplements have a need for them (eg, to avoid nutrient defi-
ciencies) and whether dietary supplements can be used to meet
nutrient requirements safely or if they contribute to risk of ex-
cess intakes and toxicity. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis
was to examine mineral intakes from the diet and to determine
how supplements contribute to meeting or exceeding the DRIs
for selected minerals in the NHANES 2003­2006.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population
The NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional
survey of noninstitutionalized, civilian US residents (14).
NHANES data are collected by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the CDC. Written informed consent was obtained for
all participants or proxies, and the survey protocol was approved
by the Research Ethics Review Board at the National Center for
Health Statistics. Data from NHANES 2003­2004 and 2005­
2006 were combined for these analyses (14). The combined
sample included 18,063 participants who had complete 24-h
dietary intake data. Subjects ,19 y of age (n = 7962) and
pregnant and/or lactating women (n = 1241) were excluded,
which left a final analytic sample of 8860 individuals.
Dietary intakes
Diet
NHANES participants were asked to complete an in-person
household interview and a health examination in a mobile ex-
amination center that included an in-person 24-h dietary recall. A
second 24-h dietary recall was collected via telephone ;3­10 d
after the mobile examination center exam. Both 24-h dietary
recalls used the USDA's Automated Multiple-Pass Method (15,
16).
Dietary supplements
Information on dietary supplement use over the past 30 d was
obtained as part of the dietary supplement questionnaire (17).
Information included the participant's use of vitamins, minerals,
herbs, and other dietary supplements. Detailed information, in-
cluding the type, consumption frequency, duration of use, and
amount taken, for each reported dietary supplement was ob-
tained. The average daily intake of nutrients from dietary sup-
plements was calculated for individuals by using the number of
days supplement use was reported, the reported amount taken per
day, and the serving size unit from the product label. Calcium
from antacids was collected as part of the NHANES non-
prescription drug questionnaire that participants self-completed
at the home interview and was included in supplemental intake
calculations.
Operational definitions
Nonusers of dietary supplements were defined as subjects who
did not report the consumption of a dietary supplement within the
past 30 d; thus, dietary intakes for nonusers were based on intakes
from foods alone. Users of dietary supplements were defined as
subjects who reported the consumption of a dietary supplement
that contained a given mineral within the past 30 d. For example,
a calcium user was someone who reported the use of calcium
regardless of the source; therefore, the calcium could be from
a multivitamin or mineral supplement, a calcium supplement (ie,
single nutrient supplement), or an antacid that contained calcium.
Dietary intakes (ie, from foods only) of users were compared with
those of nonusers. Total mineral intakes were defined for dietary
supplement users as mineral intakes from food sources plus
mineral intakes from dietary supplements.
The prevalence of inadequate dietary intakes of a group was
determined by using the EAR cutoff method for all minerals
except iron (18). The probability method and the cutoff method
are both approaches that require more than one 24-h dietary recall
to adjust for individual variation. The EAR cutoff method
assumes that there is no correlation between intakes and re-
quirements, the variance in intakes is greater than the variance of
requirements, and the distribution of requirements is symmetrical
around the EAR. If these assumptions are met, as was the case for
all nutrients examined in this study except iron, the number of
individuals with usual intakes below the EAR is proportionate to
the prevalence of the group with inadequate intakes. Because the
distribution of requirements for iron was skewed (ie, not sym-
metrical), the cutoff method was not appropriate, and the
probability method was applied (18). All analyses were kept at
the group level, and interpretation of results were restricted to
group-level differences.
Statistical analysis
The NCI method (19) was used to determine estimates of the
usual nutrient intake from the diet for nonusers and users of
dietary supplements. The usual total nutrient intake (from the diet
and supplements combined) was also estimated for users of
supplements with the NCI method. Covariates used in the NCI
model were as follows: 1) the sequence of the 24-h recall, 2) the
day of the week the 24-h recall was collected [dichotomized as
weekend (Friday­Sunday) or weekday (Monday­Thursday)],
and 3) dietary supplement use. Complete details of the NCI
method are shown elsewhere (19), and the SAS macros (SAS,
version 9; SAS Institute Inc) necessary to fit this model and to
perform the estimation of usual intake distributions are available
on the NCI website (20).
DRI age groups were used to compare estimates of mineral
intakes to EARs for minerals with established EARs. Potassium
does not have an established EAR, and thus, only mean estimates
were presented. Because the distribution of requirements was
skewed for iron, the probability method was used to determine the
prevalence of the population below the EAR (21). The percentage
of the population that exceeded the UL was also determined for
each of the minerals with an established UL (21­23).
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS software
(version 9; SAS Institute Inc). Sample weights were used to
account for differential nonresponse and noncoverage and to
adjust for the planned oversampling of some groups. Survey
weights were also used to generate nationally representative
estimates for the US population. We compared mean dietary
intakes of minerals between users and nonusers of dietary sup-
plements and the proportion that met the EAR and exceeded the
UL by computing a z statistic, which yielded the same result as
an unadjusted regression model (24). Significance was set at
a Bonferroni-corrected P , 0.003 to ensure that the significance
we showed was not due to chance.
RESULTS
Mean intakes by dietary supplement usage category
For men, dietary intakes from food sources of 4 minerals
(magnesium, copper, potassium, and selenium) were higher in

users than in nonusers of dietary supplements (Table 1). For
minerals that did not differ by supplement use (calcium, iron,
zinc, and phosphorus), total intakes (food plus supplements)
were significantly higher in supplement users than in nonusers.
Mineral-containing supplement use did not significantly in-
crease mean phosphorus, potassium, and selenium intakes from
intakes from diet alone. In women, dietary intakes of supple-
ment users were significantly higher than those of nonusers for all
of minerals examined with the exception of selenium. Phosphorus
and potassium supplement use by women did not significantly
increase total intakes over intakes from food alone.
Dietary calcium intakes were significantly higher in supple-
ment users than in nonusers across all age groups for women but
not for men (see supplemental Table 1 under "Supplemental
data" in the online issue for a presentation of mean dietary in-
takes by the DRI age and sex groupings of supplement users and
nonusers). Magnesium intakes from the diet were significantly
higher in male dietary supplement users than in nonusers at all
ages but not in women.
Prevalence of inadequate intakes from food sources
In men, when food sources were considered alone, supplement
users and nonusers differed only in the prevalence of inadequacy
for magnesium and copper (Table 2). No differences between
supplement users and nonusers were observed in the prevalence
of inadequate intakes from food sources alone for calcium, iron,
zinc, phosphorus, or selenium. The prevalence of inadequate
iron, phosphorus, and selenium intakes from food sources was
very low in men (ie, ,0.5%). For all minerals except selenium,
women who used dietary supplements had a significantly lower
prevalence of inadequate mineral intakes from food sources than
did nonusers (see supplemental Table 2 under "Supplemental
data" in the online issue for a presentation of age-group dif-
ferences in the prevalence of inadequate mineral intakes be-
tween supplement users and nonusers).
Prevalence of inadequate total intakes (diet and
supplements combined)
We examined mineral intakes from food sources alone in
supplement nonusers and compared these diet-only intakes to
total intakes (diet and supplements) of supplement users. As
expected, dietary supplement use lowered the prevalence of
inadequate total intakes for every mineral examined in adults
when sexes were combined (Figure 1). In men, dietary sup-
plement users had a significantly lower prevalence of inadequate
total mineral intakes for calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phos-
phorus, and copper but not for selenium (Table 2). The use of
dietary supplements lowered the prevalence of inadequate total
intakes for each mineral examined in women; the most notable
difference between supplement nonusers and users was for
calcium intakes. Supplement use dramatically decreased the
prevalence of inadequate calcium intake across all age groups of
women (Figure 2).
Prevalence of intakes above the UL
Mineral intakes from food alone that were above the UL were
shown in ,0.5% of the adults studied. Although the prevalence
of the total intake above the UL for minerals was close to zero
(data not shown) in dietary supplement users, the prevalence of
total intakes above the UL for calcium, iron, zinc, and magne-
sium was higher (Table 3). In the adult population of supple-
ment users (when sexes were combined), ;6% of subjects
exceeded the UL for calcium, ;9% of subjects exceeded the UL
for iron, ;9% of subjects exceeded the UL for zinc, and ;6% of
subjects exceeded the UL for magnesium (data not shown). In

the UL for calcium, ;12% of subjects exceeded the UL for iron,
;11% of subjects exceeded the UL for zinc, and ;4% of
subjects exceeded the UL for magnesium. Older men were more
likely than were younger men to exceed the ULs for iron, zinc,
and magnesium. About 7% of women who used dietary sup-
plements exceeded ULs for calcium, iron, zinc, and magnesium.
DISCUSSION
In general, dietary supplement users tended to have higher
usual mean intakes of minerals from their diets than did nonusers,
especially in women. In men, mean intakes of magnesium,
copper, potassium, and selenium from food sources were sig-
nificantly higher for users than for nonusers of supplements.
However, only the prevalence of inadequate intakes was lower for
magnesium and copper. In men, the difference between dietary
intakes in users and nonusers of supplements was most notable
for magnesium; a clear explanation of this finding was not ev-
ident. Stronger associations between higher mineral intakes from
foods and a lower prevalence of inadequate intakes were ob-
served in women. Women who used supplements were much less
likely to have inadequate magnesium and calcium intakes from
food sources than were nonusers. This finding was not surprising
because many experts recommend that adult women consume
and use supplemental calcium to lower risk of osteoporosis, and it
is likely that women who use supplements are making dietary
choices aligned with this recommendation.
Calcium is a nutrient of public health concern; recently, DRIs
were established on the strong evidence that calcium was related
to bone health and risk of falls and fractures, particularly in older
women (22). Calcium intakes of US adults remain below the
recommended intakes set forth by the DRI panel (22). For
women, the EAR and RDA are 1000 and 1200 mg Ca/d, re-
spectively, for individuals .51 y of age. For men, the EAR and
RDA is 800 and 1000 mg Ca/d, respectively, for individuals 51­
70 y of age, and the EAR and RDA is 1000 and 1200 mg Ca/d,
respectively, for individuals .70 y of age. Overall, 71% of
nonusers and 24% of users of supplements had intakes below the
EAR, including calcium intakes from the use of antacids and

calcium that are in the water supply. In subjects .51 y of age,
close to 90% of nonusers and ;30% of users did not meet the
EAR (Figure 1). Our data and those of others (9, 25) suggested
that the majority of older adults who do not use calcium-
containing dietary supplements are not meeting their needs
through the diet alone.
When total intakes (diet and supplements) of users were
compared with dietary intakes of nonusers, users had signifi-
cantly higher mean intakes than nonusers did across all age
groups and in both men and women. The use of dietary sup-
plements did not substantially contribute to intakes of phosphorus
and potassium, primarily because dietary supplements do not
typically contain large amounts of these minerals. In supplement
users, the prevalence of inadequate total intakes of calcium, iron,
magnesium, zinc, and copper was much lower than the preva-
lence of inadequate intakes from food alone. However, even in
users of supplements, ;20% of US adults reported intakes be-
low the EAR for calcium and magnesium.
Ervin and Kennedy-Stephenson (25) examined NHANES III
data (1988­1994) in older adults (60 y of age) by mineral
supplement use. For calcium, dietary intakes were significantly
different for both men and women by supplement-use catego-
ries, whereas we only showed differences in women. We could
not directly compare our findings to the earlier NHANES III
data because we used different age groupings; however, dietary
intakes of calcium in our current study were ;200­300 mg
higher than those of older adults in the NHANES III (25).
Ervin and Kennedy-Stephenson (25) also showed significant
differences in iron intake from the diet for male supplement users
compared with male nonusers, whereas we did not observe these
differences . Similar to the earlier report, we showed that dietary
zinc intakes in older women supplement users were higher than in
nonusers (see supplemental Table 1 under "Supplemental data"
in the online issue). In NHANES III and NHANES 2003­2006,
total dietary intakes were higher and the prevalence of in-
adequate intakes were lower in older adults who used supple-
ments than in older adults who did not use supplements.
Approximately 65% of adults who did use dietary supplements
reported magnesium intakes from food sources that were below
the EAR. Inadequate iron intakes were not an issue in men,
regardless of supplement use; however, 13­16% of adult women
in the United States reported intakes that do not meet the EAR
through the diet alone. For dietary supplement users, the prev-
alence of inadequate intakes was virtually nonexistent for iron,
zinc, phosphorus, copper, and selenium.
The finding that subjects who used mineral-containing
supplements already had higher mineral intakes from food
sources alone is of public health relevance for 2 important
reasons. First, dietary supplements may not be used by indi-
viduals with the greatest need (ie, people with lowest dietary
intakes). Conversely, supplement users represent a group who
may be at risk of exceeding the UL if their supplement intakes
greatly exceed RDA amounts. If other studies confirm this
finding, educational messages to limit total intakes to
RDA amounts may be in order. The use of supplements did not
greatly move the distribution of intakes above the UL for
phosphorus, copper, and selenium. However, the use of dietary
supplements did increase the prevalence of intakes above the UL
for calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc. High doses of calcium
and iron may pose problems. The adverse effects of chronic
exposure to high calcium intakes are an increase in the prevalence
of kidney stones and hypercalcemia (22). Chronic iron excess is
particularly problematic because it can accumulate in the tissues
and organs once storage sites are saturated (21). However, even at
the 90th percentile, users of iron-containing dietary supplements
were below the UL for iron (45 mg) for adults with the
exception of men 71 y of age, whose 90th percentile of total
usual iron intake was 75 mg (data not shown). The short-term
effects of high zinc intakes are primarily related to gastroin-
testinal distress, whereas chronic high intakes of zinc may
suppress the immune response, decrease HDL-cholesterol con-
centrations, and may reduce copper status (ie, a decrease in
erythrocyte copper-zinc superoxide dismutase). The UL for
magnesium was set from supplemental sources only; one
cannot exceed the UL from the diet alone. The adverse effects of
high intakes of magnesium are primarily related to gastroin-
testinal distress, such as cramping and diarrhea. It should be
noted that the prevalence of intakes above the UL reflects
a population perspective. It was not possible in this study to
determine whether two 24-h dietary recalls were sufficient to
identify individuals who exhibited clinical signs or symptoms of
excess.

Dietary supplement use increases with age, whereas most
mineral needs do not. Thus, older adults may be more likely to
have excessive total intakes for some minerals than do younger
persons. Overall, 6% of adults had total usual calcium intakes
above the UL; however, the prevalence increased to almost 16%
in 51­70-y-old women. In men aged 71 y who used mineral-
containing dietary supplements, the prevalence of usual intakes
above the UL for iron was almost 20%, and it was 16% for zinc.
The relatively high usual mineral intakes of these subgroups
raise some potential safety concerns.
A limitation of this report is that the estimates relied on self-
reported dietary data for both nutrient intakes from foods and
dietary supplements. The models that we applied also relied on
assumptions that reported nutrient intakes from food sources on
the 24-h recalls were unbiased, and the self-reported dietary
supplement intake reflected the true long-term supplement in-
take. Furthermore, estimates of minerals contributed by dietary
supplements depended on the label declarations rather than
analytic values. The data presented in this manuscript should be
interpreted with these limitations in mind.
Dietary supplement use is common, particularly in older adults.
The most commonly used dietary supplements in the United States
are multivitamin and mineral preparations. Ideally, formulations
and amounts of minerals in these types of supplements should be
used to help meet, but not exceed, DRI recommendations to best fit
the nutrient needs of adults (13). Our results confirmed previous
findings that individuals who use supplements tended to have
higher mineral intakes from diet alone, and they also had a lower
prevalence of inadequate intakes than individuals who did not
report the use of mineral supplements. Thus, people who use
mineral-containing supplements are, in many cases, already
obtaining more of these nutrients from food sources in their diets
than are nonusers of mineral-containing supplements. Less than
0.5% of US adults have dietary intakes above the UL recom-
mendations; however, the use of dietary supplements increased the
prevalence of total mineral intakes that were above the UL for
calcium, zinc, magnesium, and iron. These data support the
contention that diets of users of mineral-containing dietary sup-
plements are different from nonusers, and from a public health
standpoint, the intakes of users of mineral-containing dietary
supplements need to be examined separately to best assess the role
of nutrients on disease risk and health outcomes (26).
The authors' responsibilities were as follows--RLB and JTD: contributed
to concept development and manuscript preparation; DRK: created data files
for demographic data and for food and supplements for the NHANES; VLF:
completed analytical and statistical portions of this work; and all authors: read
and approved the final version of the manuscript. None of the authors had
a personal or financial conflict of interest.
