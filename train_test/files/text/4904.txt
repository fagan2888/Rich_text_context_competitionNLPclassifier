Introduction
Modern concepts of quality assessment and assurance of
school work are based on the professional autonomy of
schools and teachers. One of the main reasons for the need to
transfer greater responsibility and autonomy to the school in
the process of quality assurance is that increased organiza-
tional authority of schools enhances their flexibility, thus
enabling higher quality work adapted to the realities of the
job. Processes of quality assessment and assurance are
closely linked to research work: more specifically, to con-
ducting self-evaluation research (Podgornik & Mazgon,
2015). The idea that teachers should conduct research work,
and that they should be reflective practitioners, originates
from the English Ford Teaching Project (1973-1976), within
which teachers were trained to carry out action research and
self-evaluation of educational practice (Stenhouse, 1975).
Research work was addressed as an integral part of the daily
tasks of teachers, and the results served as a basis for further
planning of educational work (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015).
Many researchers (e.g., Berger, Boles, & Troen, 2005;
Ermenc Skubic & Mazgon, 2015; Grimmett, 2007; Moore,
2007; Smith & Sela, 2005; Vogrinc & Valencic Zuljan, 2009;
Wilson, 2000) have established that teachers' research work,
including self-evaluation, is an important factor of their pro-
fessional development, and of achieving quality educational
work. According to researchers, self-evaluation or research
work enables teachers to become more familiar with students,
the institution and themselves as teachers, resulting in changes

The Role of Headteachers, Teachers,
and School Counselors in the System of
Quality Assessment and Assurance of
School Work
Vesna Podgornik1 and Janez Vogrinc1
Abstract
In many countries in recent decades, great importance has been placed on the concept of quality assurance in education. In
Slovenian schools, quality assessment and assurance processes are based on a combination of self-evaluation and external
evaluation, although significantly more weight has been attached to self-evaluation than external evaluation lately. Efforts to
achieve the highest possible levels of quality and school work performance are based on the assumption that the concept
of quality should be developed at the level of the professional autonomy of schools and individual teachers. Our empirical
research, which was conducted on a sample of 1,530 teachers, counselors, and headteachers of primary and secondary
schools in Slovenia, showed that the majority of professional workers in education recognize the importance of conducting
self-evaluation for their profession. Using factor analysis, it was established that the frequency of conducting self-evaluation
in schools is most affected by the following factors: (a) the opinion of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors on the
positive effects of self-evaluation; (b) the school climate; (c) the attitude of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors
toward research; and (d) the attitude of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors toward their own professional
development. Multiple regression analysis of the obtained factors was made, and a model was designed to predict the
frequency of the performance of self-evaluation. It was established that the frequency of conducting self-evaluation is most
strongly affected by the attitude of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors toward their own professional development
and by their opinions on the positive effects of self-evaluation.

in their teaching practice in line with research findings.
Teachers consequently feel more competent and advance pro-
fessionally, they are able to better reflect on their classroom
work, they gain a deeper insight into the process of teaching
and educating, their research work facilitates the transfer of
their theoretical knowledge into practice, and so on.
Evaluation studies are focused primarily on changing the
existing status, with a fundamental objective of achieving
progress in practice. Based on the ongoing and final conclu-
sions of evaluation research, plans for further work are
developed that include the introduction of changes and
improvements directly into educational practice (Podgornik
& Mazgon, 2015). Evaluation in education is therefore a pro-
cess aimed at determining the extent and manner of achiev-
ing educational goals. It is the process of systematically
collecting information on the achievement of these goals,
with a view to resolving current issues directly in educational
practice. Factors that are proven to have a positive impact on
the achievement of the set goals are retained in the future,
while in areas where the set goals have not been achieved, it
is necessary to consider the reasons for this and to seek
improvement.
In general, evaluation is therefore the process of gathering
information (according to relevant criteria, with measure-
ments and corresponding analysis) to establish a rational
basis for assessment in decisive situations (Stufflebeam,
1985). Through evaluation, evidence and verifiable findings
are obtained regarding the quality of programs, projects, ser-
vices,organizations,andtheworkofindividuals(Stufflebeam
& Shinkfield, 2007).
Self-evaluation is not, however, a subjective, arbitrary
assessment of work by the individual school or teacher;
objective understanding is required. The basic sense of self-
evaluation is that the school and teachers assess their own
status by employing various research methods, data collec-
tion techniques and instruments that can be standardized or
designed for the needs of specific evaluation studies. Self-
evaluation is always associated with a tendency to provide
the highest quality of school work. There are, however, dif-
fering views on what actually constitutes the quality of
school work and which approaches are most appropriate to
quality assessment and assurance.
Principles and Approaches to Quality
Assessment and Assurance in
Education
Quality is an elusive concept, as it varies in space and time.
It depends on the context in which it appears, as well as on
the interests, values, beliefs, and so forth of the individual
society, or even of individuals. Quality in education must be
seen in the context of the respective cultural discourse
(Stronach, 1999). At the European level, quality in educa-
tion is perceived as a structured concept comprising 16 indi-
cators in four different fields of education: (a) attainment
(indicators: mathematics, reading, science, information and
communications technology (ICT), foreign languages,
learning to learn, civics), (b) success in the transition
between different levels (dropout rates, completion of sec-
ondary education, and preparation for tertiary education),
(c) monitoring of school education (evaluation and steering
of school education, parental participation), and (d)
resources and structures (education and training of teachers,
the level of participation in pre-primary education, the num-
ber of students per computer, and the educational expendi-
ture per student; cf. "Indicators on the Quality of School
Education," 2000).
According to Sallis (2002), the quality of school work is a
dynamic concept that cannot be specified, because quality
has many meanings. To define quality, the factors contribut-
ing to a good school must therefore be discussed. Sallis iden-
tifies four imperatives of quality: (a) the moral imperative,
which dictates that all "clients" or "users" (students, parents,
community, etc.) are entitled to the highest quality educa-
tional services; (b) the professional imperative, which is
closely linked to the moral imperative, that is, all institutions
are obliged to provide students with an educational process
that meets the highest professional standards; (c) the com-
petitive imperative, that is, the ability of educational organi-
zations to cope with the challenge of competition, with one
of the most effective approaches being constant care for
improving the quality of their services and processes; and (d)
the imperative of accountability, according to which educa-
tional organizations are part of their environment and are
expected to act responsibly toward the funders, which
includes ensuring a public demonstration of the high stan-
dards of the processes and services of the organization.
Within the process of quality assessment and assurance,
Sallis distinguishes three basic approaches1 to quality: (a)
quality control, (b) quality assurance, and (c) total quality
management.
Quality control includes the planned and systematic
supervision of the process and the status outcome, as well as
the necessary corrections of activities to fulfill the set require-
ments. It therefore includes the identification and elimination
of processes and services that do not meet the standards.
Quality assurance is a proactive approach whose main task is
to prevent errors or their repetition. This approach is adopted
internally by all employees, who aim for the quality improve-
ment of their work, with the standards and criteria being
established within the organization (Dahlgaard, Kristensen,
& Kanji, 2002; Sallis, 2002). Quality is therefore embedded
in the process of operation of an institution, aiming at ensur-
ing conditions for its operation that allow for the achieve-
ment of the pre-established goals. Total quality management
is a proactive approach that builds on approaches to quality
assurance. It is a conceptual approach that relies on internal
and ubiquitous quality improvement, focusing on the inte-
gration of all employees at all times and in all processes. The
philosophy behind it is never-ending, long-term quality
Podgornik and Vogrinc 3
improvement, undertaken step by step and focusing on the
needs of the user (Dahlgaard et al., 2002; Sallis, 2002).
Eurydice (2008) data show that the arrangements made
for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and
adopted in various countries can be classified into three
systems. The first system emphasizes the evaluation func-
tion of inspection bodies and the standardization of evalua-
tion criteria; the second system focuses on the role of the
national accountability structure in schools and includes the
development of national standards, while the evaluative
role is transferred to local authorities and the funders of
educational institutions; and the third system includes
countries that have not formally established the system of
accountability.
Assessment and Quality Assurance
Processes in Slovenian Primary and
Secondary Schools
In Slovenia, compulsory basic education (from now onwards
primary school)
lasts for nine years and is divided into three educational triads.
Children enter primary school at the age of 6. In the first
educational triad, pupils are taught by a class teacher. From Year
4 to Year 6, the number of subject teachers gradually increases,
so that pupils can get used to having several teachers. Subject
teachers teach exclusively in the third educational triad and in
upper-secondary schools. (Valencic Zuljan, Cotic, Fosnaric,
Peklaj, & Vogrinc, 2011, p. 296)
Primary schools provide a compulsory and extended cur-
riculum. The compulsory curriculum must be provided by
schools and studied by all pupils. It consists of compulsory
subjects, electives, home room periods, and activity days
(culture, science, sports, technology). School must provide
the optional elementary school curriculum, but pupils are
free to decide whether they will participate ("Educational
System in Slovenia," 2009). At the end Year 6 and Year 9,
pupils are assessed in national examinations in the mother
tongue and mathematics, in Year 6 also in a foreign lan-
guage, and in Year 9 in a subject determined by the Minister
(out of compulsory subjects from the Year 8 and 9). Results
do not affect pupils' grades; they are only an additional
information about their knowledge levels ("Assessment in
Single Structure Education," 2016).
Upper-secondary education is organised in general and
professional grammar schools (so-called gimnazije), with a
duration of four years, in technical and professional schools
(with a duration of four years), and in vocational schools (three
years, except for shorter vocational education courses, which
last for two years). The objectives of professional and technical
education and training are to develop key competences, skills
and vocational qualifications at an internationally comparable
level and to provide knowledge and skills for employment,
further education and lifelong learning. (Valencic Zuljan et al.,
2011, pp. 296-297)
Technical and professional schools end with a Vocational Matura
exam (exam in four subjects; the exams are prepared externally
and assessed internally). ("Educational System in Slovenia,"
2009, p. 2)
Gymnasia offer students four years of general education aimed
at upgrading and extending the knowledge gained during
compulsory education. Gymnasia ends with a Matura exam--an
externally prepared and assessed exam in 5 subjects, 3 of which
are compulsory and 2 which are elective. (Valencic Zuljan et al.,
2011, pp. 297-298)
All teachers and school counselors who would like to
work in primary and upper secondary schools are required
to complete a second-cycle study programme and attain a master's
degree (300 ECTS) in order to be able to enter the teaching
profession. Teacher education study programmes comprise the
study of the subject discipline, education sciences (included
Research in Education where they gain knowledge about self-
evaluation) and pedagogical training. School counsellors have to
complete a master study programme in psychology, pedagogy,
social pedagogy, special education, inclusive education or social
work. Teachers and school counsellors also have to pass the State
Teacher Certification Examination, a national exam, taken before
the National Examination Board for professional competency
examinations in the field of education, which is appointed by
the Minister of Education. (Valencic Zuljan et al., 2011,
pp. 299-302)
The State Teacher Certification Examination consists of
oral examination that includes the constitution of the
Republic of Slovenia, the constitution of the European Union
and its legal system, and regulations specifying human and
children's rights and basic privileges, legislation in the area
of education, and Slovenian written language (Valencic
Zuljan et al., 2011).
The weekly teaching load is up to 22 teaching hours for
teachers in primary school and up to 20 teaching hours for
teachers in secondary school. Rest of the time (till a 40-hr
weekly workload), teachers spent on lesson preparation,
assessment of pupils products, the implementation of self-
evaluation, care for their own professional development,
and so on. School counselors have a 40-hr weekly workload
and one of their main task is also self-evaluation of school
work. Teachers and school counselors that wish to gain new
knowledge can participate in in-service training throughout
their careers. They are enabled by their employer to partici-
pate "in programmes of professional education that are pub-
lished within the selection of programmes of further
education and training at least 5 days a year or at least 15
days in three years" (Valencic Zuljan et al., 2011, pp. 311-
312). However, there are also other programs or models
important for their professional development like: thematic
4 SAGE Open
conferences, study groups, professional staff networks,
research work, and so on.
The Organisation and Financing of Education Act (2008)
provides the formal and legal framework for quality assess-
ment and assurance in education, assigning the obligation to
assess and assure quality to the headteacher. As a type of
evaluation, the execution of self-evaluation is also the
responsibility of the headteacher. The school management is
obliged to produce an annual report on self-evaluation in the
school, which must be adopted by the School Council.
Furthermore, schools undertake an analysis of the implemen-
tation of the annual work plan. This can also be understood
as a form of self-evaluation and is a useful starting point for
the further planning of work.
In Slovenian primary and secondary schools, the pro-
cesses of quality assessment and assurance are based on a
combination of self-evaluation and external evaluation,
although lately significantly more weight has been attached
to self-evaluation. External evaluation is carried out by the
Ministry of Education within the scope of accreditation pro-
cesses, when determining the fulfillment of the basic require-
ments for the fundamental quality of work (verifying the
suitability of premises, staff, programs and other conditions).
A special form of external evaluation in Slovenia falls within
the tasks of the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for
Education and Sport (The School Inspection Act, 2005).
School inspection includes monitoring the implementation
of laws, other regulations, and acts governing the organiza-
tion and implementation of education and training provided
by kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools.
Thus, the principal task of school inspection is monitoring
the correct fulfillment of formal requirements, whereas peda-
gogical decisions (e.g., the choice of learning forms and
methods of work, the realization of the curriculum, etc.) are
within the domain of the individual teacher or school.
Other activities in the system of quality assessment and
assurance are based on the self-evaluation approach. Thus,
Slovenia has decided to move away from focusing on quality
assessment and assurance as a process of control over the
work of educational institutions and teaching staff (Podgornik
& Mazgon, 2015). Rather than emphasizing external verifi-
cation of the results achieved and planning processes to
ensure their improvement, there is a tendency to transfer the
care for the quality of education to the institutions and
teachers.
In Slovenia, the process of self-evaluation is supported by
various national projects for quality assurance. Most of these
projects are based on self-evaluation, with the data sources
being both objective (achievements that can be determined
relatively objectively) and subjective (opinions of various
participants, acquired in very different ways).
The use of different databases has even become an ele-
ment of quality assessment and assurance. Primary and sec-
ondary schools typically assess the learning performance of
their population in relation to national results (external
knowledge examinations in primary school and at the end of
secondary school), while teachers perform individual and
group reflection on the performance of their students in indi-
vidual subjects.
In Slovenia, data on the learning outcomes of students are
collected every year by the National Examinations Centre
through the compulsory National Assessment of Knowledge
(NAK) in Year 9 of primary school, and, since the 2013-2014
school year, also in Year 6 of primary school. At the second-
ary-school level, these data are collected through the school-
leaving exam taken at the end of grammar school (so-called
Matura) and secondary technical and vocational schools (so-
called Vocational Matura; The Matura Examination Act,
2007; The Primary School Act, 1996, 2006). The data
obtained can be combined with other data and used to evalu-
ate the national education system. In primary school, the
NAK has a formative role and students' knowledge is not
assessed, but the data are nonetheless collected to monitor
the progress of students in terms of meeting the set knowl-
edge standards.
Slovenia also participates in various international studies
(e.g., PISA, TIMSS, etc.) based on the comparison of learn-
ing outcomes of students from various countries in specific
areas (e.g., mathematics, science, literacy, etc.). If properly
analyzed and interpreted, this information provides the state
with an important element for assessing the international
comparability of the education system.
To accurately define the quality status of the education
system and to devise a plan that should lead to improvements
in this area, it is important to analyze and take into account
the data collected by external assessment (e.g., international
knowledge research, NAK), but findings from self-evalua-
tion research are also used in the interpretation of these data.
A single data source is not sufficient for a detailed analysis,
as each approach has its advantages and disadvantages.
External assessment enables more objective data collection,
ensuring greater objectivity of the produced, evaluated, and
interpreted results, and allowing for a comparison of the
achievements of the individual with his or her peers on the
national (i.e., NAK, Matura) or international level (e.g.,
TIMSS, PISA). This provides teachers with important addi-
tional (more objective) feedback on their students' knowl-
edge, and thus, indirectly, on their own work. The weakness
of external assessment is that the interpretation of results
does not take into account the characteristics of the individ-
ual institutions in which students learn and teachers work.
Such information is easier to obtain using a self-evaluation
survey implemented by teachers who are very familiar with
the institution in which they work. To interpret the data col-
lected by external assessment correctly, it is necessary to
consider the whole context: the sociocultural environment in
which the institution is located, the characteristics of the stu-
dents, the nature of cooperation between parents and teach-
ers, which professional development options are available to
teachers, how the institution is equipped, and so on. It is
Podgornik and Vogrinc 5
therefore important that external assessment data are com-
bined with data collected through self-evaluation studies,
and that on this basis measures are proposed that should lead
to higher quality educational work.
Purpose and Method of the Research
The research work of practitioners can be understood as an
attempt to link teaching and research so that they are no lon-
ger two separate tasks, instead becoming interrelated and
complementary activities (Cole & Knowles, 2004). It is cru-
cial that the research work of teachers is carried out by the
teachers themselves (possibly with the assistance of external
research experts), and that it follows the criteria of scientific
research and thus also the principles of research ethics.
In the present empirical research, the focus was on the
conducting of self-evaluation research in Slovenian primary
and secondary schools, based on the assumption that, if we
want the results of self-evaluation to form the basis for the
further planning of educational work, the concept of quality
needs to be developed at the level of the professional auton-
omy of the school and the individual teacher (Podgornik &
Mazgon, 2015).
The frequency of self-evaluation research depends on
many factors (e.g., the teacher's knowledge of conducting
self-evaluation research, etc.), with the views of headteachers,
teachers, and school counselors on the importance of conduct-
ing self-evaluation research being an important element. The
focus of the present empirical research was therefore the views
of respondents on research and the performance of self-evalu-
ation, as well as on their own professional development.
The empirical research established:
·
· Whether headteachers, teachers, and school counsel-
ors of primary and secondary schools differ in their
opinions on the importance of self-evaluation for their
profession;
·
· How pedagogical workers (headteachers, teachers,
and school counselors) at primary and secondary
schools rate their qualification to perform certain
activities within a self-evaluation survey (setting
goals or content planning, methodological planning,
designing instruments for data collection, etc.);
·
· How the following factors act as predictors of differ-
ences in the frequency of the performance of self-
evaluation: (a) the opinion of professionals on the
positive effects of self-evaluation, (b) the school cli-
mate, (c) the attitude of professionals toward research,
and (d) the attitude of professionals toward their own
professional development.
Basic Research Method
The basic research methods are the descriptive and causal
non-experimental methods of pedagogical research. The
study is based on the quantitative research paradigm.
Sample
The research involved 1,530 respondents. The sample was
selected systematically, with primary and secondary schools
from various geographical areas of Slovenia being included
in the survey. The sample is representative and is further
specified.
A total of 1,109 respondents from 107 primary schools
responded to the questionnaire on the performance of self-
evaluation in primary school. The overall responsiveness of
schools was 71.3%. (Table 1)
The questionnaire on the performance of self-evaluation
in secondary school was completed by 421 respondents. The
questionnaires were returned by 33 secondary schools. The
response rate was 66.0%. (Table 2)
Data Collection and Instrument
The data were collected using questionnaires designed for
primary and secondary-school headteachers, teachers, and
counselors. Six content-related questionnaires were com-
piled, each tailored to a specific group of respondents (e.g.,
the statement from the questionnaire for teachers "Teachers
must evaluate their work" was changed into "Headteachers
must evaluate their work" in the questionnaire for head-
teachers and into "School counselors must evaluate their
work" in the questionnaire for school counselors). When
drawing up the questionnaire, an analysis of the literature on
the performance of self-evaluation was considered, and the

empirical research already conducted in this area was
reviewed (e.g., Partnership of Faculties and Schools,
Research on Teaching Practice and Direct Application of the
Results in the Educational Work: Teacher-Researcher and
Inter-Subject Links; for more detail, see Krek & Vogrinc,
2007). The data were collected by a questionnaire, consist-
ing of seven rating scales (the rating scale of the areas of
subjected to the self-evaluation of teachers and counselors;
the rating scale of the reasons that affect the frequency of
self-evaluation; the rating scale of the approaches that could
contribute to the more effective implementation of self-
evaluation; the rating scale of the headteachers', teachers',
and school counselors' competence for the implementation
of the various stages of self-evaluation; the rating scale of
knowledge of national projects to identify and provide for
the quality of educational work; the rating scale of the char-
acteristics that the pedagogical staff attach to self-evalua-
tion; the rating scale of how much time the teachers of
primary and secondary schools devote to the reflection of
specific areas of their work) and of the Likert-type scale of
attitudes. In the article, only the data collected by the Likert-
type scale of attitudes, which was used to establish the atti-
tude of headteachers, teachers, and counselors to their
professional development, research, and the implementation
of self-evaluation (the Likert-type scale of attitudes com-
prised 22 items) and the data collected by the rating scale of
the headteachers', teachers', and school counselors' compe-
tence for the implementation of the various stages of self-
evaluation (the rating scale comprised eight items) shall be
presented.
The validity of the questionnaire was checked with factor
analysis--specifically, the percentage of variance explained
by the first factor--while the reliability of the questionnaire
was tested with Cronbach's coefficient alpha.
From the data presented (Table 3), it is evident that the
scales achieve sufficient reliability (Cronbach's  coefficient
 .60) and validity (more than 20% of the variance is
explained with the first factor).
An envelope was sent to each school containing one
questionnaire each for the headteacher and the counselor, as
well as 10 questionnaires for primary-school teachers and
15 questionnaires for secondary-school teachers. The head-
teachers were asked to distribute the questionnaires to teach-
ers in alphabetical order (regardless of the class they taught,
the subject they taught, the educational program they taught,
etc.). If a particular school employed more than one coun-
selor, it was requested that the questionnaire be completed
by the counselor with more years of work experience. The
headteacher appointed a person to collect the questionnaires
at the school and send them to the authors of the present
article.
Data Processing
The data from the questionnaires were processed using
descriptive and inferential statistics: frequency distribution
(f, f%) of attributive variables, basic descriptive statistics of
numerical variables (mean, standard deviation), the Kullback
2Î test (because the condition of the theoretical frequencies
for the chi-square test was not fulfilled), Levene's test for
equality of variances (F test), the t test. Factor analysis was
also undertaken: the major components method, Varimax
rotation, and multiple regression for analysis of the relation-
ship between a single dependent variable and multiple inde-
pendent variables, in which the method of least squares was
used and all of the selected variables were simultaneously
incorporated in the model (Enter method). The data are pre-
sented in tabular form. The percentages are calculated on

Results and Discussion
The major advantage of self-evaluation is that the school is
responsible for raising and maintaining its own quality inde-
pendently, exploiting its own strengths and resources. Over
time, good self-evaluation evolves in a continuous process of
improving operational and organizational quality and effi-
ciency, significantly affecting all aspects of the life and work
of the school. Furthermore, the research showed that the
majority of the respondents were aware of the importance of
the performance of self-evaluation. Although the responses
of different groups of respondents to this question showed a
statistically significant difference (2Î = 71.935, g = 20,  =
.000), the majority of the respondents replied that they per-
ceived conducting self-evaluation as important or very
important for their profession. In the present research, the
group with the largest proportion of respondents who believe
that conducting self-evaluation is important or very impor-
tant is primary-school headteachers (89.7%), followed by
secondary-school headteachers (86.2%), primary-school
counselors (80.5 %), and primary-school teachers (79.5%),
while the share of secondary-school counselors (66.7%) and
secondary-school teachers (66.4%) who share such opinions
is slightly lower (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015).
For headteachers, teachers, and school counselors to be
able to explore pedagogical practice and effectively carry out
self-evaluation, it is assumed that they possess appropriate
methodological knowledge in addition to knowledge of their
area of expertise. Headteachers, teachers, and school coun-
selors evaluated their ability to set the goals of self-evalua-
tion (content planning, what to evaluate), its methodological
design (research plan, sample, data collection process, etc.),
the development of instruments for data collection, data pro-
cessing, interpretation of the results, report writing, and
informing the public (teachers, parents, etc.) of findings, as
well as their ability to plan improvements of school practice
basedonthefindingsofself-evaluationresearch.Respondents
were asked to assess their ability to perform specific activi-
ties within self-evaluation process, with the Grade 5 indicat-
ing a very good level of qualification, and the Grade 1
reflecting a very poor level of qualification (Table 4).
Pedagogical workers from primary school gave the high-
est rating to their ability to write reports on the findings of
self-evaluation, followed by their ability to interpret results,
to inform the public (teachers, parents, etc.) about the find-
ings, to set goals and plan the content of the self-evaluation,
and to process the collected data. Pedagogical workers from
secondary school feel most qualified to interpret the results
and to set goals or plan the self-evaluation regarding content.
Both pedagogical workers from primary and secondary
school assigned the lowest rating to their ability to devise
instruments for data collection, and their ability to undertake
the methodological planning of self-evaluation (research
plan, sample, data collection process, etc.).
As professionals, teachers cannot be mere implementers
of decisions; they should participate actively in the formula-
tion and adoption of decisions, and in the evaluation of their
implementation (Niemi & Jakku-Sihvonen, 2006). The edu-
cation of teachers based on a culture of research follows
from the assumption that teachers should be trained to moni-
tor and critically evaluate new findings and achievements of
sciences that are important for their professional conduct as
well as for self-studying, developing and evaluating teach-
ing. According to MacBeath (2011), a paradigm shift from a
passive and subordinate role to an active role takes place,
with educators becoming the primary initiators of self-evalu-
ation and taking responsibility for their individual and col-
lective professional development.
Using factor analysis, the present study established which
factors affect the frequency of performing self-evaluation.
Some 22 variables were included in the factor analysis, that is,
22 statements with regard to which the respondents indicated
the extent of their agreement. The respondents were asked to
assess their opinions on a 5-point Likert-type scale, on which
by selecting the rating 5 the respondent strongly agrees with
the statement, whereas by selecting the rating 1 the respondent
strongly disagrees with the statement (Table 5).
The outcomes of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and
Bartlett's test showed the factorization to be reasonable and
justified (Table 6).
After the extraction of the factors, they were rotated
according to the Varimax (orthogonal rotation) and oblimin
(oblique rotation) methods. Based on Thurstone's simple
structure criteria, we decided that the Varimax rotation was
the better solution, as the structure is simpler and more trans-
parent according to this rotation.
Four factors account for 60.523% of the total variance:
31.970% of the variance was explained by the first factor,
14.037% by the second factor, 8.089% by the third factor,
and 6.427% by the fourth factor.
Four factors were obtained (Table 7). Based on the contex-
tual characteristics, they were named as follows: (a) positive
effects of self-evaluation (this factor comprises statements
showing the attitude of the respondents toward self-evalua-
tion and their opinions regarding the positive effects of carry-
ing out self-evaluation), (b) school climate (this factor consists
of statements relating to the climate in the institution, the atti-
tude of colleagues and the headteacher toward a teacher who
conducts surveys and takes part in research projects, etc.), (c)
the attitude of teachers toward research (this factor consists of
statements that relate to the attitude of the respondents toward
the survey, the publishing of articles in which they present the
findings of the empirical research to inform the wider profes-
sional public about their work, etc.), (d) the professional
development of teachers (the fourth factor consists of vari-
ables referring to the respondents' attitude toward their pro-
fessional development; it also comprises a variable that

indicates teachers' awareness of the impact of self-evaluation
research on their professional development).
The influence of these four factors (the opinion of profes-
sionals on the positive effects of self-evaluation, school climate,
the attitude of teachers toward research, and the attitude of
teachers toward their own professional development) as predic-
tors of differences in the frequency of carrying out self-
evaluation was also examined (Table 8). The frequency of
Podgornik and Vogrinc 9
self-evaluation was assessed on an annual basis, regardless of
the content area in which self-evaluation was carried out (e.g.,
the effectiveness of approaches to teaching, establishing the
classroom discipline, classroom climate, etc.).Amodel was for-
mulated with multiple regression analysis using the method of
least squares, with all of the variables being simultaneously
included in the model (the Enter method).
The determination coefficient (R2) shows that the obtained
regression model accounted for 7.4% of the variance. The
ANOVA value was statistically significant (F = 28.228,  =
.000), which means that the presented model significantly
improves the forecast of the frequency of carrying out self-
evaluation (Table 9).
The model shows (Table 10) that the frequency of per-
forming self-evaluation is statistically significantly influ-
enced by the following factors: the opinion of teachers on the
positive effects of self-evaluation, the school climate, and the
attitude of teachers toward their own professional develop-
ment. Based on the statistical significance of the t values, it
can be concluded that the frequency of performance of self-
evaluation is most strongly affected by the attitude of teach-
ers toward their professional development, followed by their
opinion on the positive effects of self-evaluation; the weak-
est, but still statistically significant, link is between the fre-
quency of the performance of self-evaluation and the opinion
of teachers on the school climate regarding the performance
of a self-evaluation.
Conclusion
The empirical research showed that among headteachers,
teachers, and counselors there are statistically significant dif-
ferences in their opinions on the importance of self-evalua-
tion for their profession. Despite the fact that all the groups
of respondents viewed conducting self-evaluation to be
important for their profession, the primary-school headteach-
ers (89.7%) were most convinced of its importance, whereas
the secondary-school teachers (66.4%) were least convinced
of its importance. Elementary and secondary pedagogical
workers estimate that during the various stages of the imple-
mentation of self-evaluation studies they are best qualified
for the interpretation of the results, for report writing, setting
the self-evaluation goals (content planning, what to evaluate)
and for informing the public (teachers, parents, etc.) of the
findings. The empirical research shows that the frequency of
performance of self-evaluation is most strongly affected by
the attitudes of headteachers, teachers, and school counselors
toward their professional development, followed by their
opinion on the positive effects of self-evaluation.
For teachers to perceive the performance of self-evalua-
tion as a permanent and important professional task that is a
prerequisite to successful quality assessment and assurance,
it is necessary to create the appropriate climate in schools,
enabling each pedagogical worker to pursue research work
and perform self-evaluation, and ultimately encouraging
them to do so. The key factors that influence the creation of
such a school climate are: mutual trust, understanding and
cooperation between the employed pedagogical workers,
personal assistance and professional support, and open com-
munication. In addition, it is important for teachers to feel
that their work is appreciated and that their proposals, ideas,
advice and the like are accepted in good faith and taken into
account by their colleagues. Teachers should also be able to
turn to their colleagues or the headteacher if needed. Based
on the findings of the present study, it can be concluded that
good conditions for research and the performance of self-
evaluation have been established in Slovenian schools: Most
of the respondents judge that their colleagues accept their
ideas, advice, and so on, that pedagogical workers cooperate
well at their school and help each other, that the professional
performance of teachers is appreciated in collective bodies,
and that a teacher wanting to introduce a specific innovation
in the teaching at their school can count on the moral support
of the headteacher.
Some authors (e.g., MacBeath, 2011; Vanhoof, Van
Petegem, Verhoeven, & Buvens, 2009) consider that school
should establish and develop a culture of learning, that is, a
"Learning Network," which involves cooperation, learning,
sharing of knowledge, views, experiences, and so on between
education practitioners. Teachers should be able to connect
and engage with their counterparts from other schools, with
external experts, and so on. It is also necessary to include
students and their parents in the processes of quality assess-
ment and assurance, as different views are appreciated in dis-
cussions on the findings of self-evaluation and on the
follow-up measures. This does not mean that representatives
of all stakeholders should be involved in making decisions
all the time, but they should be included where necessary and
appropriate (taking into account their knowledge, experi-
ence, possession of information, etc.). It is recommended
that a special team of teachers should be established to carry
out self-evaluation at school, with a core mission of planning
and carrying out self-evaluation within a specified time
period. On the basis of prior joint decisions (of all pedagogi-
cal workers) about the priorities and substantive areas of
self-evaluation, such a group should provide a self-evalua-
tion research plan and decide on the methodology of work,
the selection of predesigned instruments and/or the creation
of new instruments (for the needs of the specific research). It
should collect data, analyze and interpret data, and, when the
research is concluded, draw up a report on the research

example, with the faculties that educate future pedagogical
workers. External experts may provide professional assis-
tance and support (regarding content and methodology) to
the school in the process of carrying out self-evaluation.
Some authors (e.g., Lunenberg, Ponte, & Van de Ven, 2007;
Michalak, 2010; Somekh, 1995) emphasize the importance
of linking researchers and practitioners to achieve the com-
mon objective, that is, to establish a school system of the
highest possible quality.
Many authors (e.g., Burton & Bartlett, 2005; Cochran-
Smith & Demers, 2008; Cole & Knowles, 2004; Gore &
Gitlin, 2004; Krek & Vogrinc, 2007; Lunenberg et al.,
2007; Meijer, Oolbekkink, Meirink, & Lockhorst, 2013;
Michalak, 2010; Niemi, 2008; Niemi & Jakku-Sihvonen,
2006; Ponte, 2005; Seberová, 2010; Vogrinc, Valencic
Zuljan, & Krek, 2007; Zeichner & Noffke, 2001) believe
that the research work of teachers is a highly effective way
of promoting their professional development, while also
contributing to an improved reputation/status of the teach-
ing profession in public. Research promotes the develop-
ment of the critical and analytical abilities of teachers,
enabling them to critically reflect on their work, gain
knowledge and experience of research work, become
familiar with new insights into theory and practice, and so
on. The research work of teachers has a positive impact on
teaching and learning, and it is strongly associated with the
introduction of innovations and changes into teaching
practice. Teacher-researchers can also use their knowledge
and experience to help their colleagues and to contribute
significantly to the development of the school as a whole,
while practitioners' research contributes important new
insights into education.
Educators should also possess at least a basic knowledge
of methodology to be able to systematically monitor and ana-
lyze their own practice, as well as to use the lessons learned
in their future work. Learning content related to the method-
ological planning and carrying out of self-evaluation should
be integrated into courses dealing with the subject matter in
the field of research (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015). Learning
content pertaining to quality assessment and assurance in
education should be addressed in other subjects, as well.
In this respect, interdisciplinary seminars designed to help
students make sense of methodological knowledge, and to
connect research with the pursuit of other professional activi-
ties, can be of great benefit (Podgornik & Mazgon, 2015).
We believe that this should be taken into account when
designing study programs (in all three cycles: undergraduate,
master's, and doctoral studies) for future teachers and other
education professionals, as well as when formulating con-
tinuing education programs and training for education
professionals.
To achieve the highest possible level of quality of educa-
tional work, it is particularly important that all education
professionals in schools, especially headteachers, constantly
seek to establish and maintain a school climate that in its core
supports individual professional development and the devel-
opment of the school as a whole.
