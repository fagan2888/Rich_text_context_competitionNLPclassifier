Background. The association between the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and an increased
risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease remains unclear.
Methods. We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of the risk factors associated with metabolic
syndrome and cardiovascular disease among patients from an urban outpatient human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) clinic. Evaluation included laboratory data that were obtained after an overnight fast and a health survey
that assessed traditional risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, HIV-related factors, and comorbidities.
Data collected were compared with data files from a cohort from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES; 2001­2002) of persons who were seronegative for HIV infection who were matched for age,
sex, race, and tobacco use.
Results. Four hundred seventy-one HIV-infected subjects provided complete data. The overall prevalence of
metabolic syndrome was similar between the group HIV-infected patients and the group of persons who were
seronegative for HIV infection (25.5% vs. 26.5%, respectively), although the HIV-infected patients had a significantly
smaller waist circumference, lower body mass index, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, higher
triglyceride levels, and lower glucose levels, compared with the subjects from the NHANES cohort. Framingham
10-year risk scores were also similar between the 2 groups. HIV-infected patients with metabolic syndrome were
more likely to be diabetic, older, and white and have a high CD4 cell count and body mass index, compared with
patients without metabolic syndrome ( for all). The type or duration of antiretroviral therapy was not an
P ! .05
independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome.
Conclusions. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is high among HIV-infected persons, but not higher than
the prevalence among HIV-uninfected persons. Traditional risk factors play a more significant role in the devel-
opment of metabolic syndrome than do HIV treatment­associated factors.
HAART has resulted in sustained reductions of mor-
bidity and mortality associated with HIV infection [1,
2]. Unfortunately, HAART has also been associated
with metabolic complications that may increase pa-
tients' risk of cardiovascular disease [3­5]. Specific an-
tiretroviral therapies have been shown to increase

proatherogenic lipid levels and contribute to the de-
velopment of insulin resistance and visceral fat accu-
mulation [5­7]. These characteristics are components
of metabolic syndrome and are risk factors for diabetes
and cardiovascular disease in the general population
[8­10]. Protease inhibitors (PIs) in particular have been
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease [11­13], possibly in part because of their negative
effect on lipids [14].
Recent studies of HIV-infected persons have revealed
a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among pa-
tients receiving HAART [15, 16]. Reported prevalence
rates have been higher than rates reported for matched
HIV-infected populations, yet they are similar to or
even less than the 22%­24% rate of prevalence reported
HIV/AIDS · CID 2007:44 (1 March) · 727
recently for the general US population [9]. Other data suggest
that the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome among
HIV-infected persons may be more reflective of the burgeoning
epidemic of obesity than a predominant effect of HAART [17].
Currently, data are lacking on risk for development of metabolic
syndrome in HIV-infected persons, particularly in HIV-infected
women and minorities, who represent an increasing proportion
of the US and global HIV-infected population. HIV treatment
guidelines recommend screening patients for metabolic com-
plications and providing therapeutic interventions [18, 19].
Such measures may include intensified efforts to assess patients
for risk factors for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular dis-
ease as part of standard-of-care. For this study, the medical
records of HIV-infected patients were reviewed to obtain risk
factors for cardiovascular disease and laboratory data to (1)
determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among a di-
verse HIV-infected outpatient population; (2) compare the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome and diabetes with a contem-
porary US cohort of HIV-uninfected individuals who were
matched for age, sex, race, and tobacco use; and (3) determine
the risk factors for the development of metabolic syndrome
that are unique to HIV-infected patients.
METHODS
Design. This was a prospective, cross-sectional evaluation of
patients' risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and
cardiovascular disease. As part of standard-of-care, all HIV-
infected patients who attended the Washington University HIV
Clinic (St. Louis, MO) during January­July 2005 completed a
cardiovascular risk survey with their providers. The survey in-
cluded evaluations of traditional cardiac risk factors, HIV-
related factors (duration of HIV infection and HAART, current
medications, and nadir CD4 cell count), comorbid conditions,
and use of medications for hypertension and dyslipidemia. Pro-
viders reviewed all information with patients, verified fasting
status, and obtained lipid and glucose measurements, blood
pressure, height, weight, and waist circumference. Providers
obtained patients' waist circumference in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) standard protocol [20].
The most recent HIV RNA level and CD4 cell count (from
within 3 months of survey completion) were obtained from
the medical chart and used for analysis. Pregnant women were
excluded from the analysis. Traditional risk factors for meta-
bolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease were compared with
those obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES; 2001­2002) data files [21]. A
Framingham 10-year risk score was calculated for all patients
[22]. The study was reviewed and approved by the Washington
University Institutional Review Board.
Definitions. According to National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines [10],
metabolic syndrome was defined as having 3 of the following
criteria: abdominal obesity (waist circumference 102 cm for
men and 88 cm for women), fasting triglyceride levels 150
mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level !40
mg/dL for men and !50 mg/dL for women, fasting glucose
levels of 100­125 mg/dL, or hypertension (blood pressure
130/85 mm Hg or current receipt of medication for hyper-
tension). For both the NHANES cohort and the cohort of HIV-
infected patients, use of a lipid-lowering agent was defined as
use of a statin, fibrate, or niacin agent. An antihypertensive was
any drug used to treat high blood pressure. Obesity was defined
as a body mass index (BMI; calculated as the weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of height in meters) 30. HAART
was defined as the use of 2 nucleosides (NRTIs) and a non-
nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 2 NRTIs
and a PI, or an NNRTI and a PI. Patients receiving triple-
nucleoside therapy only were not included in this analysis.
Analysis. Data were analyzed using x2 or Fisher's exact tests
for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared
using Student's t test or the Mann-Whitney U test for normally
and nonnormally distributed variables. Partial correlationstest-
ing was used to test the strength of association between the
diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome and other clinical
variables for the cohort of HIV-infected patients. Significant
variables were entered stepwise into a multiple logistic regres-
sion model to determine the best multivariate model. NCEP
criteria for metabolic syndrome were not included in multi-
variate analyses. Instead, they were analyzed separately in a
subanalysis focused on determining the risk (OR) of individual
NCEP criterion for metabolic syndrome diagnosis. HIV RNA
levels were log-transformed. All P values were 2-tailed.
For comparisons between the cohorts of patients infected
with HIV and patients seronegative for HIV infection, HIV-
infected patients were randomly matched to subjects from the
NHANES (2001­2002) data files (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention Web site [21]). Subjects from the NHANES
cohort were randomly chosen from those who matched our
patients according to age (within 3 years), sex, race, and smok-
ing status. HIV testing was only performed for subjects in the
NHANES cohort who were !50 years of age; thus, we could
only be certain that subjects in the NHANES cohort who were
!50 years of age were not infected with HIV. However, the
number of patients in the cohort of HIV-infected patients who
were 50 years of age was generally low (16%), and the number
of HIV-infected persons in the NHANES cohort who were 50
years of age was likely quite low. For predictors that were sig-
nificantly different between the 2 cohorts, additional multiple
regression analyses were performed controlling for age, race,
sex, and BMI to determine predictors of individual NCEP cri-
terion. Data were analyzed with use of the SPSS software pack-
age, version 12.0 (SPSS).

RESULTS
A total of 601 patients (394 men [66%] and 207 women [34%])
completed the metabolic survey. Sixty-one percent were African
American, and 69% were currently receiving HAART; 10% were
HAART naive. The proportion of women and African Amer-
icans in our clinic population was similar to that of the HIV-
infected population in the United States [23]. The respective
waist circumference and BMI for the entire cohort were 90.1
cm and 25.8 for men and 93.3 cm and 29.9 for women (P !
). The mean current CD4 cell count was 449 cells/mm3.
.01
Seventy-seven percent of patients receiving HAART had an HIV
RNA level !400 copies/mL.
Of the patients who completed the survey, 471 had complete
laboratory data that were obtained during a period of fasting
and were thus evaluated for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome
(table 1). Among this subgroup, 120 patients (26%) had met-
abolic syndrome, and 381 patients (81%) met 1 of the criteria
for risk of metabolic syndrome. During a univariate analysis
that excluded the 5 NCEP criteria for metabolic syndrome,
HIV-infected patients with metabolic syndrome were more
likely to have a family history of cardiovascular disease or di-
abetes, be of white race and older age, have had a longer du-
ration of HIV infection, and have a higher low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) cholesterol level, a higher BMI, and a higher

CD4 cell count, compared with HIV-infected persons without
metabolic syndrome ( for all characteristics). Using
P  .05
multivariate analyses excluding the 5 NCEP criteria, significant
predictors of metabolic syndrome among HIV-infected patients
were older age, a higher CD4 cell count, white race, and a
higher BMI ( for all predictors). The comparison of
P ! .05
patients with and without metabolic syndrome revealed no sig-
nificant differences with respect to the use of HAART or the
type of HAART (figure 1).
A separate analysis was performed for the patients in the
HIV-infected cohort to identify the contribution of each in-
dividual NCEP criterion towards diagnosis of metabolic syn-
drome. Despite a high prevalence of a low HDL level and high
triglyceride levels, the presence of either an elevated fasting
glucose level or hypertension were the strongest contributors
to metabolic syndrome (OR, 11.4 [95% CI, 6.9­18.9] and 9.3
[95% CI, 5.8­14.9], respectively).
We also explored the finding of an increased CD4 cell count
as an independent predictor of the occurrence of metabolic
syndrome in HIV-infected patients. An increased CD4 cell
count was a strong predictor of 2 NCEP criteria (elevated tri-
glyceride and glucose levels; ) after controlling for age,
P ! .01
sex, race, and BMI. Likewise, an increased CD4 cell count cor-
related with the presence of an increased number of metabolic
syndrome criteria and an increased BMI ( for both; figure
P ! .01
2A and 2B). The change in CD4 cell count (from nadir to
current value) also tended to correlate with an increased num-
ber of metabolic syndrome criteria ( ).

Sex and HIV-infected patients. Among HIV-infected pa-
tients with metabolic syndrome, men were significantly older,
more likely to be white, have a family history of diabetes, and
be receiving HAART, compared with women (table 2). Among
the persons in this subgroup, men also had higher Framingham
scores and triglyceride levels and lower BMI and waist circum-
ference, compared with women ( for all).

waist circumference and BMI were significantly higher for
women, compared with men. However, African American men

tended to have higher levels of triglycerides and glucose and a
lower HDL cholesterol level, compared with African American
women. Overall, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the
patients in the HIV-infected cohort was not significantly dif-
ferent between men and women when stratified by race (22%
women vs. 21% men among African Americans subjects and
29% women vs. 32% men among white subjects).
The HIV-infected cohort vs. the NHANES cohort. The
overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the Framingham
scores were similar between the HIV-infected and NHANES
cohorts. However, individual metabolic parameters differedsig-
nificantly (table 3). HIV-infected patients with metabolic syn-
drome had smaller waist circumferences, lower BMIs, lower
HDL cholesterol levels, higher triglyceride levels, and lower
glucose levels, compared with patients in the NHANES cohort
with metabolic syndrome ( for all). Despite the higher
P ! .01
prevalence of dyslipidemia in the HIV-infected patients, com-
pared with the patients in the NHANES cohort, nearly twice
as many HIV-infected patients were already receiving lipid-
lowering therapy (9.3% vs. 4.9%; ).

The effects of HAART. During multivariate analyses that
controlled for age, sex, race, and BMI, current PI use was an

who had no history of stavudine use ( ). Stavudine use

was not associated with changes in BMI or waist circumference.
Current NNRTI use and lower HIV RNA levels were found to

significantly associated with lower HDL cholesterol levels
( ). Other HIV-related predictors, such as nadir CD4

nificantly associated with dyslipidemia or other risk factors for
metabolic syndrome during multivariate analyses. Our obser-
vations of the HIV-infected and NHANES cohorts combined
revealed that HIV infection was a significant independent pre-
dictor of both elevated triglyceride levels and low HDL cho-
lesterol level ( for both), after controlling for demo-

DISCUSSION
Among the patients of the urban, HIV-infected population, we
found a high prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome and its
associated risk factors. Nonetheless, the prevalence rate was
similar to a well-matched, current population of HIV-unin-
fected individuals. For the patients in the HIV-infected cohort
and excluding NCEP criteria, traditional factors (e.g., older age
and higher BMI), higher CD4 cell count, and white race were
the strongest predictors of the presence of metabolic syndrome.
Unexpectedly, the duration and type of HAART were not strong
predictors. Among the 5 NCEP criteria for metabolic syndrome,
the presence of elevated fasting glucose or hypertension in as-
sociation with HIV infection carried the highest risk of devel-
opment of metabolic syndrome. Most HIV-infected patients
with either of these diagnoses also tended to meet additional
NCEP criteria for metabolic syndrome. In summary, among
HIV-infected persons, traditional risk factors were more im-
portant predictors of metabolic syndrome than therapy-related
factors.
Among HIV-related factors, although a higher CD4 cell
count was an independent predictor of the development of
metabolic syndrome, a higher BMI accounted for a substantial
part of the CD4-attributable risk. Other studies have found a
lower CD4 cell count to be associated with metabolic syndrome
or increased cardiovascular risk [16, 24­26]. However, the cur-
rent findings are consistent with the expected increase of weight,
improved nutritional and immunologic status that occurs with
effective anti-HIV therapy, and prolonged survival. The mean-
ing of this finding is not clear, but it may reflect the physio-
logical changes (unknown mechanisms) that accompany im-
mune reconstitution or viral suppression. Better adherence to
HAART was an unlikely factor, because similar percentages of
patients with and without metabolic syndrome had an unde-
tectable viral load. These potential links need to be examined
further.
In the general US population, epidemic rates of obesity, in-
sulin resistance, hypertension, and associated complications [9,
27] have been noted during recent years. The current findings
suggest that HIV-infected persons treated with HAART are not
spared from this emerging epidemic, as demonstrated by their
high rates of obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dysli-
pidemia. These findings, along with a lack of independent ef-
fects of HAART on metabolic syndrome, support the notion
that these traditional risk factors (i.e., hypertension, hypergly-
732 · CID 2007:44 (1 March) · HIV/AIDS
cemia, and obesity) may be more important than HAART-
related factors for the prediction of metabolic syndrome and
cardiovascular disease risk. The prevalence of diabetes was sim-
ilar between the cohort of HIV-infected patients and the NHA-
NES cohort, and mean fasting glucose levels were significantly
lower in HIV-infected persons than in HIV-uninfected indi-
viduals. A recent study reported a high prevalence of diabetes
in men receiving HAART [28], but these findings may also
reflect the high prevalence of diabetes among US adults (es-
timated to be 9.6% for 2005) [29], which is comparable to the
prevalence of diabetes among our clinic population. The high
prevalence of hypertension among the patients in the HIV-
infected cohort was also similar to the NHANES sample pop-
ulation and was comparable to the reported prevalence rates
of hypertension for the general populations of North America
and Europe [30].
An important finding was the higher prevalence of dyslipi-
demia, despite the greater use of lipid-lowering therapy for
HIV-infected patients than for HIV-uninfected persons, al-
though these cohorts had similar prevalences of metabolic syn-
drome. HIV infection is associated with an increase in triglyc-
eride levels and a decrease in HDL level [31, 32]. Stavudine
and PI use may also contribute to hypertriglyceridemia [33],
which was consistent with our findings. Although dyslipidemia
was predominant in the patients in our HIV-infected cohort,
we found the presence of either hypertension or hyperglycemia
carried a significantly more likely association with metabolic
syndrome than the presence of high triglyceride levels, a low
HDL level, or an elevated waist circumference. These results
suggest that HIV and HAART-related dyslipidemia often occur
as lone phenomena, whereas other traditional risk factors (i.e.,
hypertension and obesity) may occur as a cluster and, thus,
carry higher risk for metabolic syndrome. Because use of lipid-
lowering therapy itself was not a criterion for having metabolic
syndrome, it is possible that our study underestimated the prev-
alence of metabolic syndrome. However, more HIV-infected
patients than subjects of the NHANES cohort still had dysli-
pidemia that met NCEP criteria. Standard pharmacologic treat-
ments for dyslipidemia in this HIV-infected cohort [19] were
likely suboptimal because of the concurrent adverse effects of
HIV infection and HAART.
Although numerous studies have implicated PIs as important
risk factors for cardiovascular disease [3­7, 11­14, 24, 25], the
use of PIs was not found to be an independent risk factor for
metabolic syndrome when controlling for other demographic
and traditional risk factors. Furthermore, when we compared
the effects of specific PIs on lipid parameters and metabolic
syndrome risk, we were unable to find any significant differ-
ences. However, nearly all of our patients who were receiving
a PI-based regimen were using pharmacokinetic boosting with
low-dose ritonavir therapy. Recent data have shown that even
the "lipid-friendly" PI atazanavir may cause a small but sig-
nificant elevation in triglyceride and total cholesterol levels
when boosted with low-dose ritonavir therapy [34]. Although
stavudine use has been associated with lipoatrophy, dyslipi-
demia, and insulin resistance [33, 35­37], only 24 patients who
were observed at our clinic were currently receiving this drug;
therefore, we likely did not have adequate power to detect any
significant effect of current stavudine use on the risk for met-
abolic syndrome.
Surprisingly, race and sex were not independent predictors
of metabolic syndrome in the patients in our HIV-infected
cohort. Among African Americans in the general US popula-
tion, women have a 57% higher prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome, compared with men [9]. Also, recent evidence indicates
that the prevalence of obesity is high (30%) for African Amer-
ican women [17]. We found an even higher prevalence of obe-
sity among the African American women (45%, compared with
16% of African American men) in our cohort. Among African
Americans, however, men had higher levels of triglycerides and
lower levels of HDL cholesterol than did women. These findings
help to explain the lack of difference in the prevalence of met-
abolic syndrome between men and women when stratified by
race. Additionally, these findings support the notion that HIV-
infected men and women may have different sex-specific risk
factors for the metabolic syndrome.
Our study had several limitations. First, the use of specific
antiretrovirals over a long period of time may have had long-
lasting, irreversible metabolic effects that were not captured in
this analysis. Given the large number of patients in our cohort,
it was difficult to obtain reliable, complete antiretroviral his-
tories with regard to the duration of the use of each antiret-
roviral drug. Also, the use of the fasting glucose level alone to
diagnose impaired glucose tolerance likely underestimated the
prevalence of insulin resistance, not only among the patients
of the HIV-infected cohort, but also among the subjects of the
NHANES cohort. Currently, oral glucose tolerance testing is
not routine, standard-of-care for HIV infection and can be
difficult to obtain, even from patients at risk for diabetes. Fi-
nally, an assumption has been made that HIV-infected persons
with metabolic syndrome are at similar cardiovascular risk,
compared with HIV-uninfected persons with metabolic syn-
drome, but the phenotype often differs between these 2 pop-
ulations. In particular, HIV-infected persons may have signif-
icant peripheral lipoatrophy that contributes to insulin
resistance and an elevated waist-to-hip ratio. Recent studies
suggest that HIV-infected persons receiving HAART have a
higher risk of acquiring diabetes [28] and, therefore, are likely
to have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease [11]. These
observations support the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in
HIV-infected persons as a likely predictor of higher risk for
HIV/AIDS · CID 2007:44 (1 March) · 733
diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and it may serve as a sim-
ple, useful screening tool for this patient population.
In conclusion, although we found a high prevalence of met-
abolic syndrome among HIV-infected patients, this diagnosis
was strongly associated with traditional cardiovascular risk fac-
tors rather than HAART-related effects. Additional longitudinal
studies are needed to determine whether metabolic syndrome
is equally predictive of future diabetes and heart disease in HIV-
infected persons compared with HIV-uninfected persons.
