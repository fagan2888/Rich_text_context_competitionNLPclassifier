Unemployment in Spain has reached striking levels; it is
now the highest in the EU-25. The Spanish unemployment
rate reached 22.2% in 2011, and forecasters predict that it
will be approximately 23% at the end of this year.
The pessimistic GDP forecasts, combined with a high
budget deficit and serious financial problems, do not seem to
augur the long-awaited employment recovery.
In this context, the new government has just enacted a
deep labor reform (the eighth since 1984) seeking to remove
labor rigidities, and they are devising a new self-employment
promotion program. These two elements are the primary pil-
lars for combating the dramatic increase in the level of
unemployment in an economy affected by the recession.
The logic of promoting self-employment as a way to combat
unemployment is quite simple. There are two ways in which
self-employment reduces unemployment: directly, by removing
a newly self-employed individual from the rolls of the unem-
ployed, and indirectly, because some of these new entrepreneurs
will contribute to job creation by hiring workers.
However, inadequate results have cast doubts on public
schemes that encourage the long-term unemployed to
become self-employed (Congregado, Golpe, & Carmona,
2010; Shane, 2009). The majority of persons participating in
the scheme were not qualified to run a business of their own
and instead decided to become self-employed as a last resort
(Rissman, 2003).
In recessions, lower factor prices (including capital) in com-
bination with lower opportunity costs of paid employment (due
to the low job offer arrival rate) tend to lead to an increase in
the number of self-employed.1 As Ghatak, Morelli, and
Sjöström (2007) note, the average quality of entrants decreases
during recessions, and this phenomenon may prolong the reces-
sion. Therefore, promoting entrepreneurship during recessions
will reinforce this process of entry into self-employment.
In any case, Lucas (1978) suggests that a large number of
these new entrepreneurs will return to paid employment in
booms. Thus, the promotion will have only a temporary effect.
In sum, promoting entrepreneurship may not be a panacea
forthelong-termredeploymentofunemployedpeople.However,
the key factor, at least in countries ravaged by unemployment
like Spain, is knowing whether the relationship between self-
employment and certain macroeconomic variables, such as GDP
or the unemployment rate, can help us better understand the pos-
sible role of entrepreneurship policies during recessions.
The relationship between self-employment and macro-
economic variables is at the heart of the debate about the

Comovement Between Self-Employment
and MacroeconomicVariables: Evidence
From Spain
Mónica Carmona1, Emilio Congregado1, and Antonio A. Golpe1
Abstract
The relationship between self-employment and certain macroeconomic variables is often at the heart of the debate about
the contributions of self-employment to employment and economic growth; examining this relationship is the aim of this
article.This article is devoted to the empirical exploration of the comovement and causality between entrepreneurship and
economic performance in both directions.This study searches for basic relationships between self-employment and certain
macroeconomic variables in Spain using quarterly data from 1980:1 to 2009:4.From this analysis,four key findings emerge: (a)
the relation between self-employment and the business cycle differs across two components of self-employment,that is,employers
and own-account workers;(b) the existence of a strong bidirectional causality between self-employment and unemployment and
GDP; (c) business cycles contain information valuable for predicting today's employers; and (d) entrepreneurship promotion
policies oriented to encourage the emergence of new job creators may be a cornerstone of a new strategy to combat
unemployment.These results should be kept in mind when designing entrepreneurship policies.

contribution of self-employment to economic development.
In particular, a better understanding of the dynamics of self-
employment over the cycle has become crucial for rethinking
entrepreneurship promotion policies during a crisis, when
policy makers are tempted to use self-employment promotion
as a countercyclical policy. The key contribution of this article
is to develop this understanding using an empirical basis to
clarify the correlation and causality relations between self-
employment and macroeconomic variables. In particular, we
investigate whether Spanish self-employment influences sub-
sequent economic performance, as suggested by some recent
research (e.g., Fritsch & Mueller, 2004; Koellinger & Thurik,
2009; Thurik, Carree, van Stel, & Audretsch, 2008) or as other
works claim (e.g., Carmona, Congregado, & Golpe, 2010;
Congregado, Golpe, & Parker, 2011), and whether empirical
evidence suggests the reverse effect, that is, business cycle
fluctuations have a greater effect on self-employment.
We analyze these relations using time-series analysis
techniques that allow us to distinguish the different causal
relations between self-employment and macroeconomic
performance.
From an empirical perspective, the available evidence
suggests that individual transitions into entrepreneurship are
more numerous in booming economies and lower in bad
ones. However, this evidence is usually based on estimates
of the sign of time dummies in individual-level studies of
occupational choice, rather than being derived from careful
analyses of time-series data.
Time-series data have been used to determine how multiple
aggregate variables covary over time. However, some stan-
dard regression analysis techniques can be vulnerable to the
emergence of "spurious" correlations. For this reason, it is cru-
cial to test the robustness of the empirical results via adequate
econometric techniques as well as via alternative approaches.
The contribution of this article to existing work on the
relation between self-employment and business cycles is
twofold. First, we apply time-series techniques to more care-
fully investigate the relation between self-employment and
business cycles. In particular, we apply these techniques to
high-frequency macrodatabases containing quarterly observa-
tions, which enables us to draw inferences on the causality of
the relation. This ability is important because stimulating
self-employment is justified only if self-employment causes
enhanced macroeconomic performance. Second, when inves-
tigating the relation between self-employment and the busi-
nesscycle,wedistinguishbetweenemployersandown-account
workers. We argue that previous entrepreneurship research
seems to have overlooked this distinction. Entrepreneurs who
hire external labor ("employers") could exhibit different cycli-
cal behavior compared with entrepreneurs who work on their
own ("own-account entrepreneurs"). In booming economies,
entrepreneurs can scale up production and expand employment,
bidding up wages, thereby drawing relatively low-value own-
account entrepreneurs out of entrepreneurship and into paid
employment (Lucas, 1978). Furthermore, we might expect
some own-account entrepreneurs to start hiring labor (Cowling,
Mitchell, & Taylor, 2004), in which case they switch from own
account to employer status. In light of this switching, one might
expect the number of employer entrepreneurs to increase rela-
tive to the number of own-account entrepreneurs, making
cyclical effects positive for employer entrepreneurs and nega-
tive for own-account entrepreneurs. Previous studies have
obviated this distinction. For this reason, previous results can
be biased because own-account workers are the more numer-
ous group within self-employment. Our empirical work will
take into account this possible source of bias.
As mentioned, this article takes a macroeconomic approach
and focuses as much on the short run as on the long run by
analyzing the comovement and the causality between our vari-
ables. The next section describes the data set and methods. We
begin with the study of comovement. This analysis involves
two different approaches: the traditional cross-correlations
approach (Burns & Mitchell, 1946) and the use of Vector
Autoregression (VAR) forecast errors (den Haan, 2000a). The
causality analysis is performed with the analysis of instanta-
neous and Granger causality. Concluding remarks are given in
the last section.
Method
Data andTime-Series Properties
The data used in this article are a sample of quarterly data on
nonagricultural2 employment by status --salaried workers
(W
t
) and self-employed workers (S
t
)--for Spain, covering
the period 1980:1-2009:4.3 Spanish aggregate statistics
allow the decomposition of self-employed workers in two
components: employers (E
t
) and own-account workers (O
t
).
Finally, the real GDP and unemployment rate are denoted,
respectively, by Y
t
and U
t
.
Self-employment data used in this article are seasonally
adjusted quarterly Spanish observations drawn from the Labour
Force Survey (LFS, Spanish National Statistics Institute). In
the Spanish LFS, workers are asked questions about their main
job or business, including, "Were you an employee or self-
employed?" If self-employed, the respondent is further asked
whether they had any employees. The self-employed in Spain
can then be classified as incorporated with or without employ-
ees or unincorporated with or without employees.
Finally, for the remainder of the data used in our empirical
work, the real GDP is taken from Quarterly National Account
database (INE).4 FigureA1 (in the appendix) plots the original
time-series data, which is seasonally adjusted, expressed in
logs. Time series are detrended using the Hodrick­Prescott
(HP) filter.5 Figure A1 represents original data and the cycles
of each variable using this filter.
Measuring Comovement
WithTraditional Statistics
This section analyzes comovements between self-employment,
real GDP, and unemployment, using the methodology
Carmona et al. 3
developed by Burns and Mitchell (1946). This method
uses the magnitude of the cross-correlation coefficient,
(j), as a measure of the degree of comovement between
each pair of series. In particular, the contemporaneous
cross-correlation coefficient (0)gives information on the
degree of contemporaneous comovement, whereas the
cross-correlation coefficient (j), j  {± 1, ± 2, ± 3, ± 4},
gives information on the phase shift of one series relative
to another (Kydland & Prescott, 1990). The comovement
between each pair of variables is defined as follows: Two
variables are said to commove in the same direction over
the cycle if the maximum value in absolute terms of the
estimated correlation coefficient is positive; they are said
to commove in opposite directions if it is negative, and
they are said to not commove if it is close to zero. A large
number in (absolute terms) appearing in column t + i(t ­ i)
indicates that the series lags (leads) the cycle by i quar-
ters. If the variable value of the cross-correlation is
highest at i = 0, then the variable is said to move contem-
poraneously with the cycle. The results are reported in
Tables 1 and 2.
Tables 1 and 2 reports the correlation between labor time
series and output (unemployment). We also report, the cor-
relations for the two components of self-employment
(employers and own-account workers), to test the existence
of "potential" opposite comovements between them over the
cycle. The critical value for the correlation coefficient--for
the whole sample--is .092.6 
x
represents the standard devia-
tion of the variable (in percentage terms), 
X
/
Y
is the stan-
dard deviation of each variable as a fraction of output
reflecting its relative variability, and 
T
is the first-order
autocorrelation coefficient, which measures persistence.7
Using GDP as a proxy for the business cycle, self-
employment and GDP show a peak correlation of .629 at a
lag of 0. This means that self-employment is procyclical and
adjusts contemporaneously with the GDP cycle.
The results are similar when distinguishing between the
two components of self-employment. The own-account
worker series shows procyclicality and adjusts contempora-
neously with the GDP; however, the correlation between the
GDP and employers peaks at .620 with a lag of one quarter.
Thus, the GDP leads employers.
To assess the robustness of these findings to the choice
of cyclical indicator, Table 2 reports the results of the same
exercise but uses unemployment in place of the GDP. In
this case, the correlation between self-employment and
unemployment achieves a peak correlation of -.660 at a
lag of 1, that is, self-employment is countercyclical and
adjusts with a lag in comparison with unemployment.
Employers and own-account workers are also countercy-
clical with unemployment. Whereas own-account workers
adjust contemporaneously, unemployment leads employ-
ers. In sum, self-employment in Spain seems to be contem-
poraneous with the cycle, whereas the business cycle leads
employers' cycles.
Measuring Comovement
WithVAR Forecast Errors
The previous approach is not the only way to analyze
comovements between variables. The comovement between
real activity or unemployment and employment series can be
also described using the correlation coefficients of forecast
errors from vector autoregresive systems at different forecast
horizons as proposed in den Haan (2000a). This procedure
has advantages over traditional statistics used in the previous
section. The previous method focused on only the uncondi-
tional correlation, losing valuable information about the
dynamic aspects of the comovements of variables. Moreover,
as the unconditional correlation coefficient is only defined
for stationary variables, the researcher has to transform the
data to render it stationary, and there are many ways of doing
this--that is, different detrending methods. Finally, this
method is suited for the discussion of short-term, medium-
term, and long-term correlations.
Following den Haan (2000a), we are going to calculate
correlation coefficients of forecast errors at different forecast
horizons, obtained from estimations of various specifica-
tions of the following VAR model:
X t t A X
t t t
t
l
= + + + +

where X

is the 2 × 1 vector containing the log of output or
the log of unemployment level, and the log of each employ-
ment series,8 , , and are N × 1 vectors of constants, A

are
fixed N × N coefficient matrices, 
t
is an N-dimensional
white noise process that is, E (

) = 0,
E ( 
t

t

, and E ( 
t

t
' ) = 0for s  t, and the total number
of lags included is equal to l.
Finally, we define the K-period ahead of the forecast error
of each variable X
t
as follows:
e X E X
t K
X
t K t t K
+ + +
= - . (2)
Then, we calculate the correlation between these K-period
forecast errors and denote it by Corr(K). Note that the use of
this approach in a particular horizon of K can be interpreted
as a cycle-trend decomposition, where the trend component
is given by E
t
X
t+K
and the cycle component is given by X
t+K,t
.
Therefore, when we analyze the VAR error forecast error
correlation at different horizons, we are studying the comove-
ment between the different cycle components of each pair of
variables. Applying this methodology, we must estimate 10
bivariate VARs (5 with regard to GDP and 5 with regard to
unemployment).9
The correlation coefficients are plotted in Figure 1. The
results confirm those of previous studies using traditional sta-
tistics. On one hand, as we can see from the figure, the coeffi-
cients are significantly positive at all horizons in relation with
4 SAGE Open
the GDP and significantly negative at all horizons in the unem-
ployment case. In both cases, the correlation coefficients tend
to become larger as the forecast horizon increases and then sta-
bilize, typically at forecast horizons of approximately 2 years.
Causality
If we interpret the presence of cross-correlation between out-
put (or unemployment) and self-employment, we should
conclude that unemployment and output transmit their cycles
to the self-employment cycle. Our objective is now to measure
the influence of the business cycle on the self-employment
cycle or vice versa, using the VAR's parameters. As they are
a transformation of the cross-correlation function, they allow
us to make inference about two types of causality: (a) Granger
causality and (b) instantaneous causality.
We start looking for Granger and instantaneous causality.
To carry out these causality tests, we need to perform the fol-
lowing VAR:

, (3)
where A
j
is the matrix of coefficients, c is a vector of deter-
ministic terms, and 
t
is the vector of innovations. At this
point, we are interested in the lag length selection of the
VAR. To determine the optimal number of lags, we estimate
an unrestricted VAR using the data in levels and then choose
the appropriate lag length using the Akaike, Schwarz, and
Hannan-Quinn information criteria. The lag length was set to
2 on the basis of Hannan-Quinn's and Schwartz's informa-
tion criteria for a multivariate system (see Table A1 in the
appendix).
One could argue that it would be interesting to study
whether the variable responds immediately to shocks in other
variables. To this end, we will use the concept of instanta-
neous causality. The instantaneous causality concept refers to
the possible instantaneous correlation between the cyclical
components of various variables. Roughly speaking, a vari-
able x
t
is said to be instantaneously causal for another time-
series variable z
t
if knowing the value of x
t
in the forecast
period helps to improve the forecasts of z
t
. In sum, if the inno-
vation to z
t
and the innovation to x
t
are correlated, then there
is instantaneous causality.10 The results of the instantaneous
causality tests are reported in Table 3. For self-employment
and own-account workers (but not the employers), our esti-
mates show an instantaneous causality with the GDP and
unemployment. However, the finding of instantaneous cor-
relation between two time series implies that causality can go

either way, that is, the concept of instantaneous causality is
fully symmetric, not specifying a causal direction.
To determine the direction of the causality relationship, we
use Granger causality. Applying this concept to our case
study suggests that the cyclical component of GDP, unem-
ployment, or paid employment does not cause, in a Granger
sense, the self-employment (employers or own-account
workers) cycle, if lagged cyclical components of GDP,
unemployment, or paid employment are not significant in the
VAR equation corresponding to cyclical self-employment. In
sum, testing for Granger causality between, for example, X
and Z consists of checking the significance of the coefficient
in the corresponding VAR equation. In other words, X does
not Granger-cause Z if the vector has no forecasting power.
Each equation represented is estimated separately in testing
for Granger causality, and the null hypothesis tested is "X
does not Granger-cause Z, and Z does not Granger-cause
X."11 The results of the Granger causality test are reported in
Table 3. Each element of the table shows the Granger causal-
ity test p value from column to row. The results confirm the
existence of a bidirectional causality between self-employment
and unemployment, whereas the GDP causes self-employment.
These results are consistent with some prior evidence of bidi-
rectionality between self-employment and unemployment
rates (Faria, Cuestas, & Gil-Alana, 2009; Faria, Cuestas, &
Mourelle, 2010; Thurik et al., 2008).
However, if we consider the two self-employment compo-
nents separately, the results are slightly different: on one hand,
the employers'cycle is Granger-caused by the rest of the cycles,
but the business cycle is not Granger-caused by the employers;
on the other hand, the own-account workers cycle is caused
only by unemployment and paid employment. Finally, the
employers' cycle is Granger-caused by own-account workers.
In sum, causality results reveal that the labor market situation
helps to forecast own-account workers, whereas the business
cycle phase (GDP or unemployment) contains valuable infor-
mation for predicting today's employers. Moreover, the results
point to the existence of a bidirectional causality between
employers and paid employment. Finally, employers appear
to adjust immediately in response only to shocks to the wage
earners, whereas own-account workers seem to respond
immediately to shocks to unemployment and the GDP.
Discussion
The objective of this article was to shed light on the interplay
of entrepreneurship and the business cycle, providing new
empirical evidence on the development of self-employment
over the business cycle to understand what may be expected of
public schemes encouraging people to become self-employed
in terms of scope and effectiveness. These public schemes are
a very highly contested policy issue because entrepreneurship
is considered to be a way to combat the current recession.
Our results identified a procyclical relationship with output
and unemployment driving cycles in self-employment cycles.
However, when we relaxed the assumption of common rela-
tionships between the two self-employment components, a
different picture emerged. In particular, the own-account
workers cycle is driven by the labor market situation, whereas
employers'cycle is driven by the business cycle phase and the
labor market situation.
From our results, one could argue that the added value of pro-
moting entrepreneurship is given only in terms of job creation
becauseitdoesnotcontributetoeconomicrecovery.Furthermore,
the promotion's effects are different for the different types of
self-employment. On one hand, the promotion of own-account
workers only leads to changes in employers'cycles, whereas on
the other hand, the promotion of job creators (employers) con-
tributes directly to job creation and reduces unemployment.
In sum, entrepreneurship policies will only have effects
on unemployment. However, it should be considered as use-
ful alternatives of active labor market policies.
Some tentative policy recommendations can be advanced
on the basis of our results. Countercyclical policies that
boost self-employment during economic downturns might
be a good complement to other active labor market policies
for combating unemployment, but positive effects on output
growth should not be expected. Only a promotion aimed at
employers could contribute to reduce unemployment; there
would be no effect on job creation if the promotion is only
targeted at the most numerous group of self-employed: the
own-account workers.

1. See the recession-push effect discussed by Storey (1994) or
the emergence of marginal worker cooperatives formed during
recessions, as Ben-Ner (1998) and Pérotin (2006) note.
2. Workers in the agricultural sector are excluded because this
sector is structurally different from the rest of the economy.
This exclusion is a common practice in the existing literature.
3. Self-employment statistics by sector were not available in
Spain until this quarter.
 4. They are expressed in 1995 prices and seasonally adjusted.
5. The Hodrick­Prescott (HP) filter is a standard method of
removing trend movements. The smoothing parameter  of
the filter, which penalizes acceleration in the trend relative to
the cycle component, needs to be specified. By using quar-
Carmona et al. 7
terly data, it is a common practice in the business cycle lit-
erature to use a value of 1,600, as the work of Hodrick and
Prescott (1997) suggests.
 6. See McCandless and Weber (1995) or Hoel (1954). The stan-
dard deviation of the correlation coefficient can be computed
as (n ­ 3)-1/2, where n is the sample size.
7. The measure of persistence is the cycle correlation with its
first lag (Campbell & Mankiw, 1987).
 8. Let us remember that these series are in logs and seasonally
adjusted.
 9. The lag length and the inclusion of linear and quadratic trends
are based on the Akaike information criterion. Ninety percent
confidence intervals are calculated by using bootstrap meth-
