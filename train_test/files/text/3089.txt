Dimensions of ageing
Reference to `ageing societies' conjures imageries that differ
sharply. In some cases they revolve around nearly bankrupt
pension or social security systems, or about families physically
and economically overburdened with responsibilities of simul-
taneously caring for very young children and the very old. In
others, they point to societies overloaded with unsatisfied
health care demands of the chronically ill, functionally disabled,
and the mentally and physically impaired. In yet others, refer-
ences to ageing evoke rumblings about stagnant economies,
sluggish increases in productivity, heavy taxation burdens,
conservative ideologies, and dismal mobility prospects for
younger generations. As is plain from reviews of the process in
general,1­15 each and every one of these issues, sharing a neg-
ative connotation, corresponds to a dimension of the ageing
process. In this paper we consider only two dimensions: demo-
graphic profile and health status. The demographic dimension
consists of conditions related to the relative size, rate of growth,
and composition of the elderly population. The health dimension
is a function of conditions that influence current and pros-
pective health status of the elderly population and their demand
for and actual use of health care.
Demographic dimension: dynamic
characteristics of the ageing process
The demographic momentum of ageing in the region is rooted
in patterns of population growth experienced over the last
50 years or so. These patterns have led to continuous increases
in the rate of increase of the elderly population (aged 60+), to
significant shifts in other indicators of ageing, such as the mean
ages of the population and, finally, to increases in the overall
speed of ageing in the region. This process is mainly attributable
to the sharp mortality declines experienced after 1940.
Although future trends fuelling ageing could conceivably
experience reversals due to sudden changes in vital events, the
most likely scenario is one where ageing will be reinforced as
fertility plummets toward lower levels in an irreversible process.
Thus, ageing in the region is driven by two forces: one is un-
changeable for it is the result of past demographic history,
and the other is unlikely to be malleable since it is the outcome
of large macro processes with a powerful momentum of their
own.
Indicators of ageing
Although there are other useful alternatives, we chose to focus
on three indicators of ageing, the proportion of the population
above age 60, C(t), the mean age of the population, A(t), and
an indicator of the availability of support among the younger
generations, L(t). The first indicator is a conventional measure
and needs little introduction. The second is also straightforward,
albeit much less used, but of extreme utility in understanding
patterns of growth of the elderly. The third, L(t), defined as
a ratio of adult to elderly population is a crude indicator of
kin availability and of constraints in the patterns of elderly
residential arrangements. Although these indicators are loosely
interrelated, the relation weakens when populations depart
from stable equilibrium. Altogether, these indicators suffice to
characterize the demographic nature of the growth of elderly
people.
Demographic regimes and indicators
of ageing
Populations with sustained high levels of fertility will have lower
values in C(t) and A(t) but higher values in L(t) than populations
with lower fertility levels. This is because in high fertility popu-
lations more recent cohorts are larger than the preceding ones,
thus biasing the age distribution toward younger ages. Higher fer-
tility levels imply both larger disparities in the size of successive
cohorts and stronger biases toward a younger age distribution.
Mortality has an ambiguous effect on all indicators. In
societies with high mortality levels, an improvement in survival
conditions leads to lower values of C(t) and A(t) and is some-
what neutral for L(t) because those who benefit most from the
improvements tend to be infants and young children, and much
less so adults and the elderly. In these societies lowering mortality
levels has the same effect as does an increase in fertility, namely,
it inflates the relative size of the cohorts who are younger than
5 years. However, in societies with lower levels of mortality,
improvements in survival tend to benefit more adults and elderly
people, thus tilting the age distribution in the other direction.
As a result, if we compare two societies with similar levels
of fertility but different levels of mortality, the one with a lower
level of mortality will have higher values of C(t) and A(t) and
lower values of L(t) than the society with higher mortality if and
when mortality levels are relatively high at the outset. When lower
levels of mortality prevail the contrast between one and the
other society will be reversed, and the one with lower mortality
will experience higher values in C(t) and A(t) and lower values
in L(t).16 As a consequence of these relations, the association
between all three indicators in populations with similar regimes
of mortality and fertility is tight. Indeed, in this comparative

static framework, knowledge of more than one indicator provides
redundant information. However, in societies with de-stabilized
demographic regimes where fertility or mortality or both have
been changing rapidly, the relation between indicators will not
always be as tidy and close, and examination of each of them
merits separate attention.
No country in the region belongs to a stabilized population
form. The actual regimes of de-stabilization are quite hetero-
geneous but admit a rather simple, though coarse, character-
ization.17,18 With a few exceptions (Argentina, Cuba, Puerto Rico,
and Uruguay), countries in Latin America and the Caribbean
experienced high levels of fertility until about 1965­1970,
when a precipitous decline began to spread in all but a handful
of nations (mostly in Central America, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru
and Ecuador). Unlike fertility, mortality began to decline prior
to 1950, although the bulk of gains in survival took place during
the Post-World War II era. In Argentina, Cuba, Puerto Rico and
Uruguay, pre-transitional fertility levels were lower than in the
rest of the region, and began to decline before 1945. As of 1990
the age structures of all countries in the region reflect de-
stabilized demographic regimes, mostly a combination of recent
sharp fertility reductions and of less recent but equally sharp
reductions in mortality.
Table 1 contains estimates of A(t), C(t), and L(t) for 1950­
1955 and 1990­1995, and projected values for 2020­2025 for
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The momentum of ageing in the region is evident in these
Tables as the empirical distributions for all the indicators
converge toward values associated with increased ageing.
Simultaneously, there is an increase in regional variance due to
heterogeneity in the timing of the mortality and fertility trans-
itions in the region. While C(t) was below 10­12% everywhere
in 1950, the latest statistics for 1990 indicate that Argentina,
Cuba, Barbados, Puerto Rico and Uruguay have all surpassed
that value, and projections for 2020­2025 suggest that only in
four countries will C(t) be contained below 12%. Elsewhere the
fraction of the population above 60 will increase sharply and
approach values similar to those reached by the US and Japan.
A(t) is highly sensitive to the specific trajectory toward older
age distributions. Whereas in 1950 most countries in the region
had values below 25 years, by 2020 all of them are expected to
exceed 25 years, and most of them will attain values surpassing
30 years. During the period 1990­2025 A(t) will increase on
average from 27.2 years to 33.3 years, a rate of increase of
about 22%. A comparison of trajectories of A(t) in the region
with those in northern Europe, US and Japan reveals that
countries in the region will experience higher rates of changes
in A(t) than what would be expected given their absolute
values of A(t).
Over long periods of time--long enough to cancel out irregu-
larities due to transient phenomena--the rate of change in A(t)
is an indicator of the speed of ageing inherent in a demographic

regime. In societies of the region where mortality and fertility
declines are packed in a few years, the speed of ageing is much
higher than that in areas such as western Europe and North
America, where mortality and fertility decline took place more
gradually over extended periods of time. The contrasts between
the speed of ageing in Latin America and the Caribbean, on the
one hand, and North America and western and northern
Europe, on the other, are startling.19 Indeed, they imply that
the speed of ageing in the region will be at least twice as high as
it was in other regions of the world for most of the time it takes
to complete the passage from a youthful to an older society. The
main implication of this regularity is that the transition toward
older societies in countries of the region gathers speed when
their age distributions are still relatively young.
Finally, L(t) is a telling indicator for it reflects the availability
of members of younger generations to elderly people. In many
societies the residential arrangements of the elderly and the
quality and quantity of transfers toward the elderly are strongly
influenced by the magnitude of L(t). During the period 1950­
2020 the median value of L(t) in the region drops from about
4.8 to 3.1 while its variance increases, reflecting inter-country
differentials in the timing of the transition toward an older
population. Barring reversals of fertility trends, the value of L(t)
will continue its steep decline and will approach rapidly levels
close to 1.5 or less.
As in the case of other indicators of ageing, relatively large
changes in L(t) are packed into a very short period of time.19
In north-western Europe and North America the transition
towards an older population involves changes from values not
exceeding 3.5 to values around 1.5. Instead, countries of the
region experience far more massive changes, as the reduction in
the absolute value of L(t) is almost twice as large, from values
around 5.5­6.0 to about 2.5. Second, if future trends conform
to projections, the change from levels of L(t) of about 3 to values
around 1.5 will occur over a period of time that is nearly half
as long as the period of time within which the same transition
took place in North America and north-western Europe. The
differences are striking, and suggest that the impact of ageing
in the region will be felt much more suddenly than ever
before.
Rate of growth of the elderly population
in the region
As in the case of total populations, an important characteristic
of the elderly population above age 60 is its rate of increase, R(t).
Table 2 displays values of R(t) for the same periods reviewed
before. To have a sense of magnitude, note that with a constant
rate increase of 0.020, the doubling time of a population is
of the order of 35 years, whereas a rate of increase of 0.040
produces a doubling time about half as long. Accordingly, the
population aged 60+ during the period 1980­2025 in the
region will, on average, experience at least one doubling
and, in more than half of the cases, a trebling before the year

2025. Two regularities associated with these patterns are
important:
Relative growth of the older population
The social and economic dimensions of the ageing process also
depend on the dynamics of the population younger than 60:
if this population grows as fast or faster than the population at
older ages then some issues, such as support of the elderly, may
be less pressing even though the absolute growth of the elderly
population has problematic consequences of its own. In this
view what matters is the relative growth of the two segments of
the population: to the extent that and for as long as the popu-
lation aged 60+ grows faster than the population below age 60,
there will be ageing. Upward pressure on the fraction of the
population aged 60+ will depend on R(t) and on the rate of
increase of the younger population. Note that increases in the
fraction of the population aged 60+, C(t), will proceed at a faster
pace the larger the differences between these rates of increase
are, and the longer the regime is maintained. A similar set of
factors account for the decrease in the value of L(t).
Since in all likelihood fertility in the region will continue to
fall toward very low values and mortality will also maintain
a downward though decelerating course,20 we will observe
steadily declining values of the overall rate of growth. Instead,
due to factors examined below, the values of R(t) will continue
to increase. The consequence of these two reinforcing trends
will be large increases in C(t) and large decreases in L(t). Table 2
shows that, with a few exceptions, the rates of increase of the
population 60+ during the more recent periods are higher than
the rate of increase of the total population. Furthermore, the
differences between rates of increase for the population above
age 60 and for the total population increase regularly during
the period of time examined. Once again, this shows that the
seeds of rapid ageing in the region have been present, though
unnoticed, for quite a long time.
Trajectory of the rate of increase of the older
population, R(t)
The rate of increase of the elderly population is a function of
three characteristics: (1) changes in past birth rates, (2) changes
in past mortality from age 0 until age 60 and (3) changes in
mortality above age 60. Since this has important implications
for the prospective health status of the elderly in the region
we show that current and future growth among elderly is due
to past mortality declines in the age group 0 to 60, not in the
improvement of mortality for elderly people (aged 60).
The characterization of past demographic trends in the region
suggested above and the most important factors determining
R(t) just outlined lead to two consequences. First, the popu-
lation who will attain their 60th birthday between 2000 and
2025 belong to birth cohorts inflated by a mild surge of fertility
in the years 1950­1965. Thus the rate of increase of the age
group 60+ will increase in part because of these transient spikes
in fertility levels. Second, and most importantly, these same
cohorts were the beneficiaries of unusually large improvements
in survival, particularly during early childhood. For example,
individuals born in 1960 experienced lower levels of early child
mortality than those born in 1955. This increases the size of the
cohort attaining age 60 in 2025 relative to the size of cohorts
that reach age 60 in the year 2020.
The key inference from these findings runs counter to popu-
lar beliefs: it is that the growth of current and future elderly
population is mostly a function of past developments in mortal-
ity (and less so in fertility), and depends to a much lesser extent
on mortality conditions at older ages.
To assess the magnitude of each of these factors we chose
three countries that roughly approximate the diversity of experi-
ences with mortality decline in the region. For each one of them
we estimate the profile of mortality decline over the period
1900­1990 and calculate projected life tables to assess future
changes during the period 1990­2020. We proceed then to
estimate the (absolute) magnitude of the contribution of
mortality changes to the rate of increase of the population in
several quinquennial age groups, starting with the age group
50­54, at various points in time starting with the year 2000.
Figure 1 displays the estimated magnitude of these changes
for age groups 50­54, 55­59, etc. for the year 2020 for these
three countries. We also include estimates for the US for com-
parison purposes. The vertical axis in each figure represents the
total cumulated change of mortality rates (per 1000) experienced
by cohorts reaching ages noted on the horizontal axis during
the year 2020. For example, compared to those who will be in
the preceding age group in 2020, Chileans who will be in the
age group 65­69 in the year 2020 will experience a cumulative
rate of reduction in mortality rates between birth and age 60
that amounts to 0.0125. For those who will be 70­74 in 2020
the rate of decrease is approximately 0.028. Since the bulk of
mortality decline, particularly during early childhood, occurred
during the post-World War II years, the peak of the graphs is
attained by cohorts born during those years (who will be aged
between 70 and 80 in 2020). Older cohorts also experience
mortality changes, but since they are not the beneficiaries of
the typically larger gains accruing to early childhood, the mag-
nitudes of the quantities are smaller. The estimates in the graph
suggest that improvements in mortality between 0 and 60
account for about 43% of the total rate of increase of the
Chilean population 60+ in the year 2020. In Mexico, the corres-
ponding values are slightly lower. The remainder is accounted
for by increases in the birth rate and, much less so, by improve-
ments in mortality at older ages. The graph also makes evident
that the contribution of mortality changes to the growth of
these cohorts is lower in Uruguay than in either Chile or Mexico,
as it should be given the earlier and more gradual nature of
changes there.
AGEING IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN 765
Figure 1 Cumulated changes in mortality; cohorts aged 60+ in 2020
Estimates for other countries in the region look very similar
to those in Figure 1. The only difference is that in cases where
the onset of the secular mortality decline is later than in Chile
or Mexico, the curves are displaced toward the left, with peaks
occurring among the younger cohorts.
A paradoxical implication: health status of
elderly is a function of past mortality regimes
The most important inference from this review is the following:
a substantial fraction of future increases in R(t) and, therefore, of the
ageing reflected in changes in C(t), L(t), and A(t), is attributable to
mortality changes experienced during the period 1930­1990. Further-
more, as shown elsewhere,21 about 70% of this change is due
to changes in mortality associated with infectious diseases in the
first 10 years of life. This is a revealing statistic: it suggests that
the relatively compressed schedule of ageing in the region can,
in part at least, be traced to the medical and public health
revolution that triggered the mortality decline nearly half a
century ago.
Why should this feature of the growth of the elderly popu-
lation be relevant? In what ways does it entail a legacy of the
past with implications for the future health and disability status
of the elderly? First, massive improvements in survival, particu-
larly those concentrated within a few years after birth, are likely
to induce important changes in the mean and variance of the
frailty distribution of the elderly population. It is well-known
that this fact alone could account for increases in the preva-
lence of morbid conditions as well as for slower improvements
in mortality at older ages than would otherwise be the
case.22,23
Second, a surging line of research is finding increasingly
credible evidence that exposure to and contracting illnesses or
deleterious conditions early in life may have enduring physio-
logical effects that could play out and have a strong influence in
adult life.24­26 From the foregoing considerations we know that
cohorts of elderly people who will reach 60 after the year 2000
are those who experienced the full benefits of the deployment
of novel medical technology introduced during the post-World
War II period. Their survival gains are less the outcome of
quantum leaps in standards of living and more the result of
successful reduction of exposure, better treatment, and speedier
recoveries.27,28 Might this combination of events enhance the
expression of negative effects of early exposure to deleterious
conditions and manifest itself in higher prevalence of later life
illnesses and disability? In other words, could it be that those
`saved' by innovative technologies bear the imprint of a clash
with early childhood illnesses that we would have never seen
had the new technology not been in place?
These considerations lead to the following conjecture: elderly
health status and functional limitations among the elderly in
Latin America--particularly among the cohorts reaching ages
60 in the period 2000­2020--are likely to have worse distribu-
tions of health status than those observed among elderly in
other places, even when relevant disparities in socioeconomic
conditions are controlled for. If this proves to be true--and we
show some evidence below that appears to confirm it--then the
ageing process in the region is characterized not just by unpre-
cedented speed and size, but also by large potential demand for
health services.
Mortality and health status of the elderly
One of the root causes of population ageing may also influence
the composition by health status of the elderly. To the extent
that early life conditions have an impact in later life, we should
expect important changes in the distribution of the elderly
population by disability and health status. Improvements in
survival during early life were largely the result of medical
innovations and were not always accompanied by changes
in standards of living. This may have altered the average
propensity to experience later life illnesses and disability. A
possible scenario is one where health and disability status
deteriorates progressively as the cohorts who experience the
bulk of mortality decline approach older ages. Since this process
has different effects across social strata and rural-urban
residence, we should also expect that social class differentials
in health status among the elderly will increase as ageing
progresses. This calls for careful evaluation and monitoring of
the progression of elderly health status and disability, as they
will exert disproportionate influence on demands for health
care services.
Ageing societies face important dilemmas but none of them is
as salient and consequential as those related to the health status
of the elderly. In developed countries at least, health care
expenditures are by far the largest component of transfers
toward the elderly.29 The level of these expenditures and their
projected trajectory in the near future are of paramount
significance for the adequate design of health policies and for
realistic appraisals of the strength and weaknesses of pension
and welfare programmes.29,30 The actual magnitude of these
expenditures will be a function of several variables, some of
which are simply beyond the control of policy makers. There is
some societal level of `desired welfare' or expected level of well-
being that, to some extent at least, all policies must reflect. This
is partially under the control of interest groups, and the private
and public sector. Given a desired level of well-being, health
costs and health expenditures will depend on the health profile
of the elderly and on the mix of technologies deployed to
maintain or improve health conditions. Of these two com-
ponents, the best known to us is the health status of the elderly.
The key factors affecting the health profile of the elderly are
incidence and timing of onset of chronic illnesses and disability,
magnitude of rates of recovery, and levels of mortality.19 What
do we know about each of these in the region? What do we
expect about their trajectory in the near future, in light of
the influence of past exposure and past behaviour, possible
innovations in treatment, and new prevention strategies? Are
these countries experiencing a compression31 or expansion22,23
of morbidity and mortality, or are they following some inter-
mediate route?32,33
Mortality above age 60
Figure 2 is a map of life expectancies at age 60, E(60), for 1950­
1955, 1990­1995 and 2020­2025. In virtually all countries the
values of E(60) for the period 1990­1995 are close to 20 years,
and compare favourably with estimates for Japan and the US.
Although it is unclear if, and to what extent, estimates of
E(60) are distorted by age-overstatement at older ages,34,35 the
time trends themselves (relative changes) are less likely to
766 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
be affected by errors. These trends imply that, barring future
increases in mortality, a newborn now will be expected to live
an average of about 20 years of life above age 60. In 1950­1955
the corresponding number was almost 10 years. Thus, changes
in mortality packed in the 50 or so years after World War II
translate into 10 extra years of life to be lived above age 60. As
implied by the 1990­1995 and 2020­2025 data, it is unlikely
that the same pace of improvements will be maintained until
2020. The main question is this: how healthy will these extra
years of life be? What kinds of health care costs are likely to be
associated with extra years of life to be lived above age 60?
If the elderly population is not only growing faster than ever
before, but is also living longer than ever before, to what extent
is the composite increase of person-years lived in old age
dominated by person-years lived in good health? Some
researchers have argued that increases in life expectancy
lead necessarily to increases in the proportion of time lived
with disability or ill-health.36,32 Others argue the opposite by
showing empirically that, in some countries at least, there has
been a gradual but very noticeable improvement in morbidity
and disability among the elderly37­39 or, alternatively, by point-
ing to the relativistic nature of notions of ill-health.40 The
foregoing review of factors accounting for the rapid increase of
the elderly population in the region suggests a more pessimistic
stance since, as we saw before, the new cohorts of elderly
people are likely to be more frail than average.
Although a convincing answer to these questions requires
information on trends in health status that are unavailable to
us, we can proceed indirectly by using preliminary results from
a newly available data base on elderly people in the region.
Current health status gauged via
self-reported health status and Activities
of Daily Living (ADL)/Instrumental
Activities of Daily Living (IADL)
A very recent source of information about health conditions
among the elderly is the data collected as part of the project
Health, Well-Being and Ageing in Latin America and the Carib-
bean (SABE). The project consists of a round of cross-sectional
surveys of representative samples of elderly populations living
in seven large cities of the region (Buenos Aires [Argentina],
Bridgetown [Barbados], San Paulo [Brazil], Santiago [Chile],
Havana [Cuba], Mexico City [Mexico], Montevideo [Uruguay]).
Each sample consisted of between 1500 and 2000 target indi-
viduals aged 60 and their surviving spouse.19 The survey elicited
information on a number of dimensions regarding health and
well-being of the elderly. One of the modules included exten-
sive questions on self-reported health status, self-reported chronic
conditions, and functional limitations (ADL and IADL). From
AGEING IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN 767
Figure 2 Maps of life expectancy at age 60 for the period 1950­2025
this module we calculate two indicators of health status: distri-
bution of self-reported health and distribution of ADL/IADL.
Self-reported health status
Table 3 displays the percentage of the population aged 60+
reporting their health in various categories in a continuum from
`bad' to `very good'. Although we do not discuss age patterns,
preliminary analyses reveal that they follow a `J-shaped' form
with sharp increases at the oldest ages of the fraction reporting
themselves in poor condition. The Table also includes com-
parable percentages calculated from the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) and Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest
Old (AHEAD), two of the most important data sources on
the elderly in the US. All estimates were calculated by gender
and, for the US, by ethnic group. Several remarks are in order.
First, to maximize comparability, we collapse the `very good'
and `excellent' categories used in both the SABE studies and the
HRS and AHEAD. The combined category is more comparable
across studies. We also assumed that the category `fair' used in
AHEAD and HRS is comparable with the middle category used
in SABE. Second, because in all countries the proportion report-
ing poor condition increases sharply after age 65 and the age
distribution in SABE countries is much younger than in the
AHEAD study, comparisons of the unstandardized proportions
self-reporting in ill-health will understate the US advantage
over SABE countries. By contrast, since the age distribution of
HRS is younger than in SABE countries, we would expect the
opposite pattern to prevail.
While self-reported health status is not an ideal indicator of
health conditions, it has been shown to be a remarkably accurate
predictor of subsequent ill-health and mortality.41­43 Three
features stand out in the Table. First, with the possible exception
of Argentina, the fraction that reports being in the `poor' or
`fair' categories is higher in countries of the regions than com-
parable figures for the White population in the AHEAD and
HRS studies. It should be remembered that the sample studied
in AHEAD corresponds to an older age bracket (70+), whereas
those of the HRS correspond to a slightly younger age bracket
(51­61). In the AHEAD the fraction of the White population
reported to be in poor/fair health condition is 33.5% among
males and 34.0% among females. In Argentina, the country in
the region with the best distribution, the corresponding num-
bers are 28.5% among males and 38.8% among females. In all
other countries the percentages are far worse than among the
White populations both in HRS and AHEAD and, in some cases,
even worse than the Black population in both US studies.
Second, the heterogeneity within the region is substantial
and is only weakly correlated with mortality levels. In fact, the
lowest percentage reported as being in poor or fair health con-
dition occurs in Argentina while the highest occurs in Mexico.
The highest and lowest life expectancies are in Cuba and Brazil,
respectively.
Third, there are very large gender disparities and they all
favour males. The differences can be as large as 12 percentage
points (in Uruguay) and as tenuous as 4 or 5 percentage points
(in Chile). This is in contrast with findings in the US and other
developed countries where the male-female differences are muted
or display the opposite pattern, namely, one whereby females
report themselves in better health conditions than males.44
If the observed gender differentials do indeed reflect latent
ill-health or limitations the patterns are ominous since elderly
women are at higher risk of experiencing worse economic
conditions than elderly males. The combination of worse health
status and lower standards of living for elderly females does not
bode well for countries where the gender disparity in survival
creates a large population of dependent elderly women.
What to make of these figures? First, one could argue that, in
addition to other problems, health self-reports may be contam-
inated by (unknown) biases which, in the region of Latin
America at least, would exaggerate bad health. This may be true,
and we need to await the results of further internal consistency
checks before passing definitive judgement on the validity of
the measures. However, in defence of self-reports as good valid
indicators of health status, one must note that these countries
represent a sample with substantial cultural heterogeneity--
some of these countries do not even share the same language
--but that, if one excludes Argentina, the within-region homo-
geneity in self-reports is fairly high.
Second, a counter argument is that the figures in Table 3 do
not take into account socioeconomic status and that countries

differ in terms of the distribution of elderly individuals by social
class. However, if social class differentials are as expected, stand-
ardization for social class will increase rather than decrease the
prevalence of those self-reporting poor health. Thus, the figures
in Table 3 are probably erring on the optimistic side, i.e. they
understate the prevalence of those reporting ill health in the
SABE countries.
Finally, without controls for relative socioeconomic status,
the comparison with the US may seem unjustified as observed
differences could be entirely due to lower average standards of
living in countries of the region. But if this were so the empirical
evidence would indeed support our main contention, namely,
that ageing in Latin America is occurring not only at faster
speed but with an unparalleled burden of ill-health.
In summary, although it remains to be confirmed, we believe
that these self-reports are not just ephemeral cultural constructs
but that they truly provide the first glimpse that something not
quite expected is afoot among the elderly in Latin America.
Prevalence of ADL and IADL
Table 4 displays the proportion of the elderly with at least one
ADL or one IADL by gender and by broad age groups. Total
prevalence of ADL and IADL reflect the same patterns as did
the figures for health self-reports: Argentina, Barbados and
Uruguay appear to be in a better position than the remaining
countries, particularly Chile (ADL), and Brazil and Chile (ADL
and IADL). Similarly, the contrasts by gender are as accentuated
as those observed for health self-reports because females appear
to experience prevalence rates that are markedly higher than
males. The patterns by age show a clear and expected increase
for the oldest group (75+). Note that, with the single exception
of Uruguay, more than a third of those 75+ experience at least
one IADL whereas the prevalence of ADL is slightly lower across
the board and lowest in Argentina, Barbados and Uruguay.
Against just about any standard, these are very high levels of
prevalence of ADL and IADL and point to needs that, in the
changing social and political contexts of these countries, may
well require practical solutions quite different from the
traditional ones.
Conclusion: fragile institutional contexts,
poverty, inequality and accelerated ageing
The region is ageing `prematurely', the composition by health
and disability status may take a turn for the worse and become
unfavourable sooner rather than later, and family and kin
networks are losing ground before societal mechanisms to effect
institutional transfers are securely in place. An important
difference between countries of the region and more developed
countries is the relation between the speed and size of the
momentum towards ageing, on the one hand, and the social
and economic contexts of the societies where the process is
taking place, on the other. The ageing process in developed
countries takes place long after they achieve high standards of
living, reduce social and economic inequalities, and implement
a number of mechanisms to offset the effects of residual inequal-
ities, at least in the area of access to health services. Social and
economic development in North America and northern and
western Europe are already in place when the demands of an
ageing society (and even the concerns about it) are recognized.
No country in the region is blessed with a similar institutional
history. Quite the contrary: in almost all cases a highly com-
pressed ageing process begins to take place in the midst of fragile
economies, rising poverty levels, expanding rather than con-
tracting social and economic equalities, and contracting rather
than expanding access to collectively financed services and
resources. Not long ago, the region was exposed to a drastic and
costly process of adjustment in response to a prolonged and
deep economic recession (`debt crisis`) that engulfed the
economies of virtually all countries. But this recession is only
the most visible part of a more entrenched, regular, and durable
process of economic deterioration.
In a bleak overview of conditions in the region, Kliksberg45
presents evidence suggesting that levels of poverty have
increased drastically since 1985 as have levels of economic in-
equality; that unemployment rates have increased, particularly
among the most youthful and poorest segment of the
population; that deficits in budgets associated with public health
have ballooned and, finally, that the informal sector of the

economy has expanded considerably. These aggregate trends
translate into strong effects at the individual level. In particular,
most subpopulations experience a sustained decreased in real
income, poorer access to health services and erosion of their
capacity to claim public sources for retirement and welfare.46,47
But the most vulnerable groups are the elderly and children and
it is in these groups where we will see the bulk of deleterious
effects.
