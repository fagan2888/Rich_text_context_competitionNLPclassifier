Introduction
The new form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) pervading
the dry zone of Sri Lanka constitutes a humanitarian tragedy
with vast implications for the society, economy, and the envi-
ronment.Firstdetectedintheearly1990sintheAnuradhapura
and the Polonnaruwa Districts in the dry zone agricultural
region in North Central Province (NCP), the disease is now
spreading to neighboring districts in the North Western,
Eastern, and Uva as well as the Central and Northern
Provinces. The CKD prevalent area covers approximately
17,000 km with a predominantly rural population of 2.5 mil-
lion (Figure 1; Chandrajith et al., 2010). CKD is the most
prevalent among male farmers in the 40 to 60 age group
engaged in rice cultivation, although lately, it has also been
detected among women, children, and even cattle (Centre for
Science and Environment [CSE], 2012).
There is scientific consensus that this fatal disease in Sri
Lanka is not related to known causes commonly identified
with kidney disease, such as, diabetes, hypertension, obesity,
or other factors such as snake bite (World Health Organization
[WHO] & Ministry of HealthCare and Nutrition,
Epidemiology Unit, Sri Lanka, 2009). The exact cause of this
disease is being determined. The WHO and the Sri Lankan
government continue to designate it as "Chronic Kidney
Disease of Unknown Etiology" (CKDu; WHO & Ministry of
Healthcare and Nutrition, 2009). This rare form of tubule-
interstitial disease involves slow, asymptomatic progressive
kidney damage over 3 or more months, making diagnosis
and treatment difficult. Nearly 80% of patients experience
total kidney failure within 2 years following diagnosis. Given
the inadequacy of medical services, the high cost of treat-
ment--dialysis and organ transplantation--and the poverty
of most victims, death becomes inevitable for most
(Handunnetti & Daniel, 2012).
A group of Sri Lankan doctors estimates that as many as
400,000 people in Sri Lanka's north central region may be
affected by the disease (Perera, 2012a). Some 22,000 people
have died from CKD over the past 2 decades in the NCP with
at least 5 or 6 out of 100 people there currently affected
(N. Gunawardena, 2012). In other words, more people in the
NCP have died from CKD than from the armed conflict in
Sri Lanka (Rathnasooriya, 2009). Some have speculated,
without any evidence, that given the proximity of the NCP to
the region claimed by Tamil secessionists, CKD could well
be the result of bioterrorism--calculated use of micro-organ-
isms to bring ill health or death to humans and the environ-
ment (Weerasekara, n.d.). In contrast to the bloody 30-year
secessionist war (which ended in May 2009) and post-con-
flict politics, which continue to draw national and interna-
tional attention, the structural violence of poverty and
environmental destruction underlying CKD has received
relatively little attention. The basic needs of poor farming

Political Economy of Epidemic Kidney
Disease in Sri Lanka
Asoka Bandarage1
Abstract
The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), taking the lives of thousands in poor farming communities in Sri Lanka, is commonly
seen as a problem peculiar to the island's north central dry zone agricultural region. The prevailing bio-medical focus is on
identifying one or more "environmental nephrotoxins." While delineating important controversies on the etiology of the
disease, this article seeks to broaden the discourse on the hitherto neglected political economy of CKD in Sri Lanka. In so
doing, it seeks to bring together the bio-medical debate on the impact of widespread and unregulated use of agrochemicals
on public health and kidney disease with broader global interdisciplinary perspectives on the industrialization of agriculture
and the consolidation of food production by transnational agribusiness corporations. The article concludes pointing out
environmentally sustainable and socially equitable development and organic agriculture as the long-term solutions to CKD
in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.

communities for affordable medical attention, safe water,
and food do not fall within the mainstream conflict resolu-
tion or human rights discourses (Meister, 2011)
Scientific researchers and government authorities are
overwhelmingly concerned with identifying one or more
"environmental nephrotoxins" to eradicate the disease
(Nanayakkara et al., 2012; Senevirathna et al., 2011;
Soderland, Lovekar, Weiner, Brooks, & Kaufman, 2010;
Wanigasuriya, Peris-John, & Wickremasinghe, 2011; WHO
& Ministry of Healthcare, Sri Lanka, 2009). This focus has
delayed action on immediate health and social needs of
patients and their families. It has also contributed to a rela-
tive neglect of the broader political-economic and social-
psychological dimensions of the problem; an exception is the
work of Chandani Liyanage and Ramanie Jayathilaka
(Liyanage & Jayathilaka, 2009). In Sri Lanka, CKD is com-
monly seen from a limited perspective as an isolated issue
particular to the island's dry zone agricultural region. Its
local designation is "Rajarata Kidney Disease," Rajarata
(country of the kings) being the ancient Sinhala name for the
dry zone agricultural civilization (Rathnasooriya, 2009).
CKD is not commonly found in other rural areas of the coun-
try that have rice cultivation practices and lifestyles similar
to the north central dry zone. Some researchers consider the
"unique hydrochemistry of the drinking water" in the
Rajarata to be the reason for the prevalence of CKD
(Chandrajith et al., 2011). Other researchers consider the
"hardness of the ground water" and the "heavy metal reten-
tion capacity" of the soil in the region to be the causative
factors (de Silva et al., 2013).
This article is based largely on a review of the literature
on CKD in Sri Lanka. While incorporating the findings of
bio-medical research, it seeks to provide a broader interdisci-
plinary and global approach to CKD. It draws on the theo-
retical perspectives of political economy, international
development, ecology, and environmental justice as well as
comparative information of spreading CKD in agricultural
regions in Nicaragua and India. The Sri Lankan case is
placed within the context of globalization and unsustainable
economic development, specifically industrialization of agri-
culture and the widespread use of controversial agrochemi-
cals. The article concludes emphasizing organic agriculture
and access to safe water and food as the long-term solutions
to CKD in Sri Lanka and related problems of public health
and environmental sustainability worldwide.
The literature review and theoretical approach of this
study are informed by many years of fieldwork. The study
has its origin in the late 1990s in the author's work in
Sri Lanka as a consultant to the Sarvodaya Women's
Movement (Sarvodaya is considered to be the largest village-
based NGO in the world) and its organic cultivation and
income generation program for women. The author's field
research and Report for Care International on Integrated Pest
Management in Sri Lanka in 1998 has greatly helped this
work (Bandarage, 1998). The author first came into contact
with kidney patients, kidney donors, and doctors in the
Kidney Unit of the Kandy hospital in Sri Lanka in 2005.
Since then, she has been investigating CKD through discus-
sions with kidney patients, donors, scientists, physicians, and
environmental and health rights activists in Sri Lanka
(Bandarage, 2005). The research has benefitted greatly from
communication with colleagues in activist organizations,
such as, the Center for Environmental Justice, an affiliate of
Friends of Earth International in Sri Lanka and the Kandy
Kidney Protection Society, an NGO that was organized
largely by volunteer doctors.
Spreading CKD
CKD is rising at an alarming rate in Sri Lanka, but the exact
extent is difficult to determine given that many people may
not be receiving hospital treatment. There is an estimated 2%
to 3% prevalence rate in all affected provinces with a 15%

prevalence rate in the 15 to 70 age group in the NCP and Uva
Province (Mendis, 2011). Between 1990 and 2007, hospital
admissions due to all diseases of the genitourinary system in
Sri Lanka doubled with hospital deaths due to such diseases
rising from 2.6 to 9.1 per 100,000 people. As the August
2012 Report from the CSE in New Delhi, India noted, "CKD
has been the predominant contributor to this rise in hospital
morbidity and mortality" (CSE, 2012)., According to the
estimates of some Sri Lankan physicians, 300 to 600 CKD
related deaths occur in hospitals annually. However, the total
number of deaths due to CKD could be as much as 1,400
annually nationwide because home deaths are not included
in death registries (Athuralia, Abeysekara, Amerasinghe,
Kumarasiri, & Dissanayake, 2009; A. Gunawardena, n.d.).
Sri Lanka has a relatively comprehensive and free public
state health care system but finds it difficult to keep pace
with the alarming rate of growth of CKD. Current dialysis
units can serve only a small proportion of patients and exist-
ing facilities are considered to be grossly inadequate. About
5% of the Annual Health Budget is spent on the management
of CKD patients (N. Gunawardena, 2012; Irin Asia, 2008;
WHO & Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition, 2009). Many
more dialysis machines and other equipment and services are
needed to meet the growing demand (N. Gunawardena,
2012). The Kandy Kidney Protection Society points out that
"awareness programs regarding prevention, screening pro-
grams for early diagnosis, provision of financial and other
support for needy patients, improvement of infrastructure
and promotion of kidney donations for transplant have to be
carried out in a well organized manner" (Kandy Kidney
Protection Society, n.d.)
In 2005, a kidney patient had to spend approximately
Rs. 10,000 (approximately USD 79) for dialysis and Rs.
800,000 (approximately USD 6,320) for a kidney transplant
(Gunatilleke, 2012). Lacking funds, patients pour into the
kidney units of the few public hospitals that provide free kid-
ney dialysis and transplants. The vast majority of the patients
who come there are so poor that many of them have to forego
some of the procedures and medications that require pay-
ment. The dialysis patients have to come several times a
week traveling great distances. Being too weak to travel
alone, they come with family members. Frequently after
dialysis, some of the patients and their families sleep together
on the hospital floors because there are not enough beds.
When a breadwinner develops kidney disease and can no
longer work, the entire family goes into financial ruin and
debt. In some cases, children have had to forego schooling to
find employment and women have had to engage in prostitu-
tion for economic survival (Bandarage, 2005).
Many patients wait years in pain and agony and many die
due to chronic shortage of kidneys (Bandarage, 2013b). Due
to the "frantic and sometimes futile search by desperate vic-
tims . . . to find a donor with a matching kidney," doctors in
the Kandy Teaching Hospital have initiated new efforts, such
as "double transplants" with four patients, two kidney donors
and two recipients side by side (Hettiarachchi, 2011).
According to the WHO, organ trafficking accounts for 5% to
10% of all kidney transplants in the world (Budiani-Saberi &
Delmonico, 2008). Kidney sales and all organ sales are ille-
gal in Sri Lanka. Until September 2010, kidney donations
were accepted only from relatives and members of the clergy.
The desperate need for kidneys led to the change in govern-
ment policy allowing kidney donations by non-relatives
(Tops.lk, 2010).
Buddhist monks, many of them young men and from rural
agricultural communities themselves, continue to be the pre-
dominant kidney donors. Like the patients, these monks have
hardly any money or material possessions; but their compas-
sion and generosity are enormous. As one mother whose son
was to receive a kidney said of his donor monk, "he is not
doing it for money. I can only bless him as I have nothing to
give." The donor monk responded, "I thought about the
impermanence of life and how our bodies will anyway
be absorbed to the soil one day. If one can make a sacrifice
when we are alive, one can gain some spiritual happiness"
(Chavkin, 2012b). Such selflessness is the most admirable,
but long-term solutions to CKD require attention to scientific
controversies and the political economy of the disease.
Identifying the Cause
Despite its emergence more than 20 years ago, the mystery
surrounding the Rajarata Kidney Disease has not yet been
resolved. People fear attending medical clinics due to the
stigma attached to being classified as a "kidney patient" car-
rying the dreaded CKD. This has contributed in part to delays
in understanding the origins and spread of CKD
(Kulatungaarachchi, 2011). The scientific community con-
tinues to be perplexed as to why CKD is peculiar to the north
central region and not the other rural areas of the country that
have similar rice cultivation practices and lifestyles includ-
ing extensive use of agrochemicals and aluminum utensils
for cooking and storing water (Chandrajith et al., 2011). A
study published in 2011 comparing three rural populations in
Medawachchciya in the NCP, Yatinuwara in the Central
Province (CP), and Hambantota in the Southern Province
(SP) concluded that while CKD of an "unknown etiology"
was prevalent in the NCP, known risk factors, notably diabe-
tes and long-standing hypertension were the main factors for
CKD in the other two provinces in Sri Lanka (Athuralia
et al., 2011). As the national controversy over the cause of
the Rajarata kidney disease expands, the disease's etiology
continues to be classified as "unidentified" (Mendis, 2012b).
A study by a team of Sri Lankan scientists published in
April 2009 attributed CKD to heavy metals from various
forms of fertilizers and agrochemicals entering the human
body through the food chain (Chandrajith et al., 2010).
Several other studies of the north central region revealed
CKD prevalence in areas where drinking water was drawn
from the ground from wells or pipelines and non-prevalence
4 SAGE Open
of CKD in areas where drinking water was obtained from
natural springs (CSE, 2012; Liyanage & Jayathilaka, 2009).
Another study published in January 2010 by a team of
Sri Lankan and Japanese scientists hypothesized that "the
unique hydrogeochemistry of the drinking water," specifi-
cally high levels of fluoride, to be the decisive factor in the
emergence of the disease in the north central region
(Chandrajith et al., 2011). Aluminum utensils used for cook-
ing and storing water, which enhance fluoride intake into the
body, and Cynotoxin that comes from blue green algae have
also been hypothesized as possible causes (CSE, 2012;
Desalegn et al., 2011; LankaJournal, 2011).
The high temperatures in the dry zone and the need to
consume higher volumes of water to regulate water balance
by farmers working long hours have also been postulated as
factors in CKD (Chandrajith et al., 2010). Global warming,
climate change, and increasing droughts and water shortages
in Sri Lanka's dry zone may not bode well for the eradication
of CKD. As a researcher from Sri Lanka's University of
Peradeniya who co-authored a 2011 Report on CKD put it,
"if the temperatures are going up, the situation is likely to
worsen" (Perera, 2012b). The Government Ministry of the
Environment has reported 1,400 droughts island wide
between 1985 and 2004, mostly in the dry zone with the most
severe ones in 2001, 2004, and 2012 (Perera, 2012b).
According to the Climate Change Unit of the Ministry, tem-
peratures in the island have risen by about 0.45° Celsius in
the past two decades (Perera, 2012c). In some of the CKD
prevalent areas, such as, the Polonnaruwa District, tempera-
tures have reached record levels of 34° to 35° Celsius (Perera,
2012b).
Research findings released in January 2011 by scientists
in the Medicine and Allied Science Faculty of the Rajarata
University in the NCP concluded that the "contamination of
water resources by extensive and continuous use of agro-
chemicals" that contain high percentages of arsenic and mer-
cury are the causes of CKD in the NCP (LankaJournal, 2011).
They also found the "total hardness of drinking water of
CKDue patients [in the region] to be very high" (CSE, 2012).
The calcium content in the hard water in the NCP when com-
bined with the arsenic in fertilizers and pesticides reportedly
forms calcium arsenic crystals. When transported to the kid-
neys, the calcium arsenate crystal "disturbs the antioxidant
defense system in the renal tissues" (CSE, 2012). Postmortem
tests have found deposits of arsenic in diseased kidneys of
CKD patients. Even a very tiny amount of arsenic is believed
tobetoxictotheenvironmentandhumanhealth(Jayasumana,
2012). A study conducted by a research team from the
Kelaniya University in Sri Lanka also found a "strong posi-
tive correlation between the arsenic content and ground
water hardness in CKDue prevalent areas" (CSE, 2012). Dr.
Priyani Paranagama of the Kelaniya Team reported finding
hyper-pigmentation and keratosis in the soles and palms of
CKD patients signifying chronic arsenic poisoning (de Silva
et al., 2013; Handunnetti & Daniel, 2012).
The above multi-factorial findings implicating agrochem-
icals and water quality soon became controversial given
wide media coverage of opposing perspectives. At a press
conference "Croplife Sri Lanka," an industry group repre-
senting 26 agrochemical companies criticized "dubious
research" of the Rajarata and Kelaniya University research-
ers asserting that there was no arsenic in the pesticides used
in Sri Lanka (AgroNews, 2011; ColomboPage, 2011). The
research was also subjected to media ridicule because
one researcher claimed that he derived the insights into the
cause of CKD through divine intervention (BBCSinhala.
com, 2011; Wansapura, 2011). A study by a team of Sri
Lankan and Japanese scientists published in June 2011 yet
again concluded that CKD was the "outcome of exposure to
an unknown nephrotoxin" (Nanayakkara et al., 2012). In
light of conflicting analyses and divergences, the Sri Lankan
Government Health Ministry announced that it would declare
the "real cause" of CKD by June 2012 after the release of a
specialist report "from a medical institution in Belgium"
(Gunatilleke, 2012).
The "real cause" has not yet been declared. The contro-
versy has only intensified taking attention away from the
broader political and economic and global context of the dis-
ease and the urgent health and survival needs of victims and
families. Recently, the debate has been focused on two
reports recently released to the media, one associated with
WHO and the other by a leading New Delhi­based NGO,
CSE. The WHO study was commissioned by Sri Lanka's
Health Ministry's epidemiological unit in 2008/2009 as an
extensive 10-part study to test "people and the environ-
ment--blood, urine, tissue samples and the region's food,
water and air" (Countercurrents.org, 2012). The CSE Study
was done in collaboration with the Sri Lankan Government's
Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the NGO,
the Center for Environmental Justice in Colombo
(N. Gunawardena, 2012). It tested drinking water as well as
soil and food in the affected and unaffected regions to deter-
mine the cause of CKDue (CSE, 2012).
While the WHO findings still remained classified, a group
of Sri Lankan doctors associated with the WHO study com-
missioned by Sri Lanka's Health Ministry's epidemiological
unit in 2008/2009 released a report on August 14, 2012.
According to that report, heavy metals in water caused by
"unregulated use of fertiliser and pesticides" is the main
cause of CKD (Perera, 2012a). Other progress reports from
the WHO Study also implicate heavy metal toxicity, particu-
larly Arsenic and Cadmium in either water or food as
reflected in raised levels of these found in urine samples of
patients (Perera, 2012a; Mendis, 2012a, 2012b). WHO prog-
ress reports claim that "drinking water is unlikely to be the
source of the Arsenic and Cadmium exposure that is causing
CKDu" (Mendis, 2011). WHO recommends "urgent action
to improve safe use and quality control of agrochemicals and
quality control of fertilizer" (Mendis, 2011). However, the
CSE Report released just 1 day later, on August 15, 2012,
Bandarage 5
ruled out Arsenic and heavy metals in food and water attrib-
uting CKD instead to poor water quality in the affected
region. Arguing that "the quality of drinking water is at the
base of all theories linked with CKDu," it called for improve-
ment of the quality of drinking water in the affected region
(CSE, 2012).
Divergent opinions highlight scientific gaps and the need
for better data collection and dissemination. Even more
importantly, it highlights the need for a multi-factorial and
integrated approach that goes beyond the fragmented search
for a single "real cause" of CKD. Instead of waiting to iden-
tify one bio-medical cause, the seemingly mysterious and
isolated Rajarata disease needs to be seen in the broader con-
text of unsustainable economic growth and the degradation
of the environment and public health. The controversy over
CKD in Sri Lanka also highlights a host of political issues
pertaining to transparency and accountability of government
authorities, international organizations, and agrochemical
corporations.
Local and international activists have accused the Sri
Lankan government for maintaining complete silence about
the findings of the 10-part WHO study commissioned by the
Health Ministry for 3 years despite "growing public pressure
and repeated promises of definitive answers" (Chavkin,
2012a). Dr. Channa Jayasumana, a member of the team of
doctors that released the earlier mentioned report to the
media in August 2012 has accused the authorities for failure
to make the WHO Report public and to take action based on
its results (Perera, 2012a). Local journalists and activists
were also asking why the findings of the WHO Report had
not yet been released (N. Gunawardena, 2012). As one jour-
nalist wrote: "We cannot afford bureaucratic apathy in a mat-
ter of such urgency and importance. The outcome of public
science must be shared with the public and media in the pub-
lic interest" (N. Gunawardena, 2012). In the CKD affected
Rajarata, there is growing frustration with seemingly endless
testing of people and their environment, bureaucratic apathy,
and the contradictory explanations given by outside experts.
No real progress is evident in eradicating the disease or
in improvement in people's lives. There is a sense that
because they are poor, they are being treated as "lab rats"
(N. Gunawardena, 2012). The local people who have lived in
the villages since birth have their own explanations of the
etiology, origin, and spread of the disease (Liyanage, 2011).
They have an experiential understanding that the "real cause"
of CKD does not lie in one isolated cause but the entire tra-
jectory of unsustainable social and economic development
set in motion in recent decades. A local Buddhist monk from
the NCP gives voice to the general consensus in the local vil-
lages when he says,
in the good old days none of these problems were evident.
Those days no chemicals were used to gain harvests. They
indulged in pure cultivation methods. Today the water content
that is used is not subjected to checks. This results in people
coming into contact with poisonous and harmful substances.
(Kulatungaarachchi, 2011, p. 13).
In certain CKD affected regions in the NCP in Sri Lanka,
the environment is extensively affected: Species of fish are
disappearing and cattle are affected with interstitial nephritis
(CSE, 2012). Pesticides are also contributing to the decline
of amphibians, such as, the common hourglass tree frog
(Jayawardena, et al., 2010). A bio-medical approach alone is
not sufficient for understanding the depth of environmental
and social destruction or long-term solutions. CKD has to be
demystified from a broader ecological and political-eco-
nomic perspective. The industrialization of agriculture and
the model of social and economic growth it represents need
exploration.
Industrialization of Agriculture
Rajarata, home to the CKD tragedy, was the seat of the
ancient hydraulic civilization and is still the "rice bowl" of
the island producing much of its staple food. A vast intercon-
nected irrigation system of reservoirs and canals formed
the basis of the prosperous economy and the Rajarata
culture (Bandarage, 1983). Even after the demise of the dry
zone civilization in 12 ad and the shift of populations to the
wet zone, the farmer remained the backbone of the society
and rice cultivation the occupation of the largest segment of
the population. However, now, CKD is decimating the bear-
ers of the noble occupation who amid enormous hardship
and suffering continue to till the land to feed the country.
Traditional agriculture in Sri Lanka, as in other parts of
the world, was characterized by ecologically sound practices
such as inter-cropping, crop rotation, use of compost and ani-
mal manure, and natural pesticides. Swidden (chena) cultiva-
tion, which complemented rice cultivation, was characterized
by diversified cultivation of millet, legumes, beans, and so
on and the abandonment of land after each season until re-
cultivation years later. Such practices helped maintain eco-
logical harmony including balance between crops and pests.
Unnatural increase in pests or contamination of water and
soil were not common problems (Thirugnanasuntharan,
1989). Labor-intensive traditional agriculture was also char-
acterized by well established collective labor sharing
arrangements with neighbors helping each other plant, safe-
guard, and harvest crops (Bandarage, 1983).
With European colonialism, a new form of export ori-
ented plantation agriculture was introduced in the wet zone
of the island. In the pre­World War II period, even this sector
relied on traditional methods, such as "cut and burn or bury"
for purposes of pest control (Thirugnanasuntharan, 1989).
The plantation sector became dominant taking land, labor,
and state support away from subsistence agriculture. The dry
zone rice cultivating areas were neglected and the rice or
paddy farmers were marginalized. As rice cultivation suf-
fered and as the population increased, the country became
6 SAGE Open
more and more dependent on imported rice and the vagaries
of the global market (Bandarage, 1983).
After 1948 in the post-independence period, the Sri Lankan
Government introduced massive projects to resuscitate rice
agriculture through irrigation schemes and settlement of
families from the populous wet zone areas to the sparsely
populated dry zone. Many of the people stricken with CKD
in the dry zone today are likely the descendants of those
who settled in projects aimed at improving farmer self-suf-
ficiency and prosperity. While a few farmers have pros-
pered, the long-term result has been political patronage,
class differentiation, and impoverishment of peasant rice
producers. The resettlement projects that could not repro-
duce traditional labor sharing arrangements and commu-
nity-based lifestyle, introduced a more competitive and
individualist approach to agriculture and social relations
(Bandarage, 1988; Udyanganie, Prasada, Kodithuwakku,
Weerahewa, & Little, 2006).
Given hypotheses implicating the hydrogeochemistry
and waterborne chemicals as causative factors for CKD in
Sri Lanka, the impact of the Mahaweli River Development
and Resettlement Program on the dry zone needs investiga-
tion. The controversial World Bank and other donor-funded
programs involving the diversion of the Mahaweli, the lon-
gest river in Sri Lanka, cover nearly 39% of the entire island.
This massive program was initially meant to be completed in
30 years but accelerated in 1977 to be completed in 6 years.
Researchers have stated that at least a third of the money for
the program was lost though graft. Faulty and hasty con-
struction of dams, reservoirs, and so on are believed to
threaten the ecological balance of the hill country where the
Mahaweli originates and the dry zone through which the
massive river flows into the ocean (Bandarage, 1988). As a
joint research study published in 2010 by Sri Lankan and
Japanese scientists pointed out, change in the hydrogeo-
chemistry and salinity in the CKD affected areas "could well
be caused by the large irrigation scheme that commenced
two decades ago" (Chandrajith et al., 2011).
The "Green Revolution" using "miracle" hybrid varieties
of seeds and dependent on extensive use of agrochemicals
including fertilizers, hormones, soil treatments, and pesti-
cideswasintroducedtoSriLankainthe1970s.Agrochemicals
that enhance crops began to be used extensively in
Sri Lanka's plantation and traditional agricultural sectors
with the introduction of the "Open Economy" and import lib-
eralization in 1977. Between 1983 and 1997, the quantities
of formulated pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, and fungi-
cides) imported increased tenfold (Sim, 1989; Taylor, 1999).
While imports leveled off in subsequent years, increasing
commoditization and industrialization of agriculture kept
pesticide use at high levels. Pesticide use has been particu-
larly heavy in the Mahaweli Development Program and the
NCP (Udyanganie et al., 2006). Graeme Taylor who con-
ducted a field study of pesticide use in the Mahaweli H area
in 1999 noted that 89% of paddy cultivated areas there were
chemically weeded. He described aspects of the industrial-
ization of agriculture:
. . . Usually the field is first treated with paraquat, and then
treated with two different herbicides. New strains of rice have
been produced that are more responsive than traditional varieties
to inputs of fertilizers, leading to improved yields. However,
increased fertilizer inputs will also result in increased weed
growth, so herbicides are commonly applied throughout the
crop cycle. (Taylor, 1999).
A study published in 2009 by Rohana Chandrajith and a
team of Sri Lankan scientists reported that paddy soils in
areas experiencing rapid economic development are polluted
with potentially toxic metals. The study observed widespread
application of phosphate fertilizers with uranium and other
elements known for their nephrotoxic effects:
The paddy soils in Sri Lanka are . . . highly modified by artificial
fertilizer applications. During the period of waterlogging in rice
cultivation, the chemical nature of the soil can be drastically
changed and pollutants can be leached easily into subsurface,
which eventually contaminate the ground water that rural people
use as a drinking water source. (Chandrajith et al., 2010)
In Sri Lanka, where rice is cultivated in two or some cases
three seasons per year, fertilizers tend to be applied 3 times
every season. Chandrajith et al explain that the recommended
amount of application is 270kg per hectare of fertilizers such
as urea, triple phosphate (TSP), and potash per season.
However, over the past few decades, their application has
increased by more than a factor of two exceeding the recom-
mended levels. They attributes this massive increase to fertil-
izer subsidies granted by the government and the use of
"very low quality" imported fertilizer due to "the unavail-
ability of a proper controlling mechanism" (Chandrajith
et al., 2010). The search for causes of the CKD epidemic
necessitates consideration of the bio-medical as well as the
ecological and political-economic dimensions of agrochemi-
cal use.
Agrochemicals
Chemical pesticides have their origin in modern warfare:
Nazi Germany experimented with them as weapons to be
used against human enemies. Malathion and Parathion were
originally developed as neurotoxins during World War II. It
was only later that they came to be applied against pests in
agriculture (Sasi, 1996). Pesticide pollution is one of the
most serious global environmental and health problems
today. Consumer agitation has led to banning and restricting
of some of the most dangerous pesticides and improving
safety standards in the global North. However, many danger-
ous pesticides banned in the North are still being "dumped"
in some countries in the South where regulation and safety
standards are far more lax (CorpWatch, 2002; Pellow, 2007).
Bandarage 7
Ultimately, however, the cycle of poison created by chemical
agriculture envelops all life on earth. The countries in the
North do not escape the poison: It comes back via pesticide-
laden food imported from the South and through the
ecosystem.
Hybrid seed varieties promoted by the Green Revolution
require large amounts of water from irrigation systems and
dams, which in turn aggravate pest problems. Populations of
harmful pests increase as they become resistant to chemical
inputs. As newer, stronger, and more serious insect diseases
and weed problems develop, even smallholders cultivating
tiny plots of land are caught in a "pesticide treadmill" that
they find difficult to escape (Bull, 1982). Excessive use of
chemical pesticides in Sri Lanka have introduced insects,
such as the brown planthopper, infecting rice crops as well as
weeds and diseases that were never problems previously. As
pesticide problems worsen, poor farmers have to buy expen-
sive and stronger varieties of pesticides before they could
earn any money from the harvest. Chemical pesticides kill
harmful pests, but they also kill beneficial life-forms disturb-
ing the delicate balance of ecosystems depleting soil of nutri-
ents and rendering lands unsuitable for cultivation. The
short-term approach leads to quick returns--high yields and
profits--but poses fundamental threats to environmental sus-
tainability, global food security, and human health (Bull,
1982; Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-Aligned
and Other Developing Countries, 2005).
A Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) study in
2005 reported more than 1,000 brand pesticide products reg-
istered marketed and/or handled by private sector organiza-
tions in Sri Lanka (Sumith, 2005). Due to "commercial
pressure and competition" between the agrochemical compa-
nies, credit facilities for purchase of pesticides are widely
available to Sri Lankan farmers (Taylor, 1999). Since the
1980s, synthetic pesticides have been "freely available over
the counter with no controls or restrictions on sales" and in
rural areas often sold "through general stores alongside food
stuffs and household goods." (Taylor, 1999).The sales-driven
promotional strategies of agrochemical firms seem to pay
little attention to farmer education of the toxicity and proper
use of pesticides. Studies have shown that some vegetable
farmers in Sri Lanka apply pesticides to their crops before
appearance of any pests as a measure of precaution (Bull,
1982; Chandrasekara, Wettasinghe, & Amarasiri, 1989). It is
also common among farmers to spray vegetable crops just
before harvesting and marketing. Most of the fruits and veg-
etables grown in Sri Lanka may thus be laden with chemicals
posing threats to producers and consumers locally and inter-
nationally (Sumith, 2005). Sociologists Ramanie Jayathilaka
and Chandani Liyanage who conducted field based research
in the Anuradhapura District report that the villagers they
interviewed believe that "all the food items including tank
fish available in their locality are not suitable for consump-
tion" because of chemical contamination and CKD risk
(Liyanage & Jayathilaka, 2009).
Even when Sri Lankan farmers are aware of the extreme
dangers of some of the agrochemicals, they lack the proper
equipment and protective gear for safe use or the facilities
for safe storage. As a result, occupational and accidental pes-
ticide poisoning is rampant. In the late 1970s, Sri Lanka had
the highest rate of pesticide poisoning in the world (Bull,
1982; Chandrajith et al., 2010; Taylor, 1999). According to
FAO figures in 1997, Sri Lanka still ranked "very high in the
Asia Pacific Region with regard to pesticide related health
hazards" with an annual total number of pesticide accidents
around 20,000 (Sumith, 2005). As David Bull noted in his
Oxfam sponsored study of pesticides and the Third World
poor,
Most of the victims of pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka are rice
and vegetable farmers. These are not rich farmers. Over 90% of
. . . paddy (rice) holdings are of 10 acres or less. It is among the
mass of the rural poor in this poor country that pesticides take
their toll. (Bull, 1982)
Minor pesticide poisoning contributes to nose bleeds,
depression, dizziness, and headaches, as well as long-term
health problems such as cancer and Parkinson's disease and
may be traceable to inhalation of the widely used herbicide
Paraquat (also known as Gramoxene) and other chemicals
(Taylor, 1999). The toxic effects are not limited to male
farmers. Entire communities are affected. Long-term repro-
ductive health problems associated with pesticides including
sterility, miscarriages, and birth defects are particularly high
in the Mahaweli areas (Care International, Sri Lanka, 1997;
International Water Management Institute, 2002). Purchase
of expensive pesticides has also put many farmers in debt
forcing some to sell their lands and become landless labor-
ers. As in India, suicide by pesticide poisoning is not uncom-
mon among indebted farmers in the agricultural regions in
Sri Lanka (Frontline, 2005).
Despite growing awareness of the risks of chemicals and
pesticides and possible link to the epidemic kidney disease,
farmers in the CKD affected regions are extremely reluctant
to give up the use of agrochemicals. They now have little
confidence in themselves and in the organic, traditional agri-
cultural methods of their ancestors. They have been made to
believe that the new chemical-industrial approach represents
progress and that chemical pesticides are indispensable for
their survival. As one farmer in the NCP put it,
It is difficult for us to earn our day to day living without using
chemicals for our cultivations. This is the stark truth. If we do
not use them our harvest will not be as bountiful as it is right
now. But then again we know the health hazards posed to us by
constant use of such products. This is the never-ending struggle
thatwearefacingandwehavenoalternative.(Kulatungaarachchi,
2011)
Recognizing the deep psychological conditioning of
farmers and difficulties they have giving up "addiction" to
8 SAGE Open
agrochemicals, village leaders are calling for strong govern-
mental action. As a Buddhist monk in the region, says,
There is no use in debating on the merits and demerits of such
products [agrochemicals] because no matter what we say these
people are beholden to these products . . . Officials must strictly
ban the use of products which imperils the lives of people. It is
only through such a measure that the government will be able to
save the lives of countless others who would otherwise succumb
to this dread in the years to come. (Kulatungaarachchi, 2011)
This, however, is not an easy task. The import of agro-
chemicals is financed by the Sri Lankan government.
Establishment of a definitive link between agrochemicals
and CKD may have significant implications for the corpo-
rate­state relationship (Chavkin, 2012a).
Battle Over Pesticides
Ten companies in the Global North now control 90% of the
44 billion dollar global pesticide market. Those consist of the
"Big Six"--Syngenta, Bayer, Monsanto, Dow, BASF, and
Du Pont--(ETC Group, 2011). Corporate control is not
restricted to pesticides; it extends to other agricultural inputs,
notably seeds and biotechnology. Fifty of the global seed
markets are dominated by 10 corporations many of whom
are also the top pesticide corporations (Pesticide Action
Network, 2013b). According to Robert Fraley, co-president,
Monsanto's Agricultural Sector (now Monsanto's executive
vice president and chief technology officer), "what you are
seeing is . . . a consolidation of the entire food chain"
(McCauley, 2013; Pesticide Action Network, 2013a). The
Pesticide Action Network points out that this consolidation is
achieved through the "revolving door" between government
and corporate sector employment and lobbying in
Washington, D.C., and other capitals around the world:
Many of the agrochemical industry's former executives, lawyers
and scientists serve in the government agencies that are charged
with keeping watch over their industries . . . The agricultural
input industry maintains an army of lobbyists in Washington
D.C., state capitals and countries worldwide to protect their
interests . . . agribusiness spends over $100 million a year
lobbying Congress. (Pesticide Action Network, 2013c)
Pesticide use is supported by governments and donor
agencies, which often require funds granted to the South to
be used to buy a pesticide of a specific origin. Pesticide use
has been growing at higher rates in the poor countries than in
the North in recent decades. In addition, no strict guidelines
exist in the United States to prevent a company from export-
ing banned pesticides (Environmental Protection Agency,
1992). The World Bank, which promotes export agriculture
in the Third World, has also earmarked large sums of money
specifically for pesticide purchases (Bandarage, 1997).
While practically all chemical pesticides were manufactured
abroad in the past, now, local formulation is increasingly
undertaken in the South by subsidiaries of Northern corpora-
tions (Bull, 1982).
In Sri Lanka, a handful of local firms--Hayleys, Harrisons
Chemical, Lankem, and CIC Crop Guard--and their subsid-
iaries sell base chemicals and patented products of transna-
tional corporations, such as Syngenta, Monsanto, DuPont,
Bayer, Ciba-Geigy, Shell Company, and F.M.C. Corporation
(de Alwis, 1989). Like the transnational corporations, some
of the leading local pesticide companies also control other
sectors of local food production--seed production, biotech-
nology, and food processing and packaging (Hayleys, n.d.)
The Capital Maharaja Organization, which acquired
Harrisons Chemical in 1989 and is considered to be the "sin-
gle largest group of private sector companies in Sri Lanka,"
also leads in the fields of communication, media, and infor-
mation technology in Sri Lanka (Capital Maharaja, n.d.).
The spread of pesticides throughout Sri Lanka is the result
of extremely effective marketing and distribution strategies
involving hundreds, if not thousands, of regional dealers and
sub-dealers. Agrochemical firms have large advertising bud-
gets, and they use attractive posters, radio, and television
advertisements and films to extol the benefits of agrochemi-
cals as the modern and practical way to high yields and
farmer prosperity (de Alwis, 1989). Long-term relationships
between the agrochemical firms and agricultural officials
(from the government's Department of Agriculture) working
at the field level help give legitimacy to pesticide use.
Cultivation of close relationships with farm leaders and local
pesticide dealers through economic incentives has also
proved to be a successful strategy for agrochemical firms
(de Alwis, 1989; Staring, 1989). The firms use well-educated,
professional marketing personnel and provide high achievers
in their dealer networks with lavish rewards and incentives.
CKD activists believe that media objectivity on the CKD may
also be compromised due to the heavy dependence of the
mainstream media on lucrative advertising in newspapers,
radio, and television by the agrochemical companies.1
Sri Lanka's powerful agrochemical industry disputes the
notion that its products are to be blamed for CKD. The
Secretary of Sri Lanka's National Agribusiness Council
claims that pesticides produced by many multinational and
international companies follow all the WHO and FAO guide-
lines and "those are not in harmful levels" (Chavkin, 2012a).
After tests revealed contamination with small amounts of
arsenic, Sri Lanka's Registrar of Pesticides briefly banned
several common pesticides containing the substances glypho-
sate and carbofuran in June 2011. However, a few months
later, the ban was lifted on grounds that "the arsenic levels
were too low to pose a serious threat" (Chavkin, 2012b).
Investigative reporter Sasha Chavkin of the international
NGO, Public Integrity points out that the ban was overturned
even when WHO's internal progress reports on CKDu in the
NCP in June 2011 called for stronger regulation of "nephro-
toxic agrochemicals" warning that any delay would cause
Bandarage 9
"further accumulation of toxic agents in the environment . . .
result[ing] in cumulative damage to the health of the people
living in these areas" (Chavkin, 2012b). An internal Progress
Report of June 2012 on CKDu in Sri Lanka by Dr. Shanthi
Mendis, Senior Advisor and Coordinator, Chronic Disease
Prevention and Management of the WHO in Geneva con-
cluded that "contamination of the soil appears to be mainly
from fertilizer and also from agrochemicals" (Mendis,
2012b). It recommended that the government
strengthen the regulatory framework to improve quality control
of imported agrochemicals, particularly with regard to
nephrotoxic agents such as cadmium and arsenic, i.e.
amendments to existing legislation, capacity strengthening for
implementation and monitoring. (Mendis, 2012b)
Anuraddha Padaniya, President of the Government Medical
Officers' Association voices the opinion of growing numbers
of Sri Lankans when he says that while tackling CKD "should
be a national priority," "vested interests" are "preventing strict
policing of agrochemicals" (Countercurrents.org, 2012). On
World Food Day, October 16, 2012, farmers from the NCP
staged a protest in front of the office of the United Nations
FAO in Colombo. The protest organized by the local NGO
Swarna Hansa Foundation claimed that CKD in Sri Lanka is
caused by chemical fertilizer use encouraged by the FAO,
which supports the multinational agribusiness. The protesters
demanded compensation for farmers suffering from CKD and
an official ban on imported agrochemicals "with immediate
effect" (H. Bandara, 2012).
In comparison with many other developing countries, the
Pesticide Registrar in Sri Lanka has been successful in regu-
lating pesticides. A regulatory mechanism was introduced in
1983 through the Control of Pesticide Act No. 33 of 1980
(Eddleton,Manuweera,&Roberts,2003;Wijegunawardhana,
2010). However, as Michael Eddleston (Centre for Tropical
Medicine, University of Oxford, United Kingdom), Gamini
Manuweera (Office of the Pesticide Registrar, Government
Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka), and Darren Roberts
(Division of Medicine, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Australia)
have written in The Lancet, global financial realities make
stricter regulation of agrochemicals difficult for the Sri
Lankan Government:
Industry resources dwarf those available to the government for
regulation of pesticides. The size of the marketing department of
one agrochemical company active in Sri Lanka is more than
three times the size of the whole government regulatory
department. It can be difficult to make big changes in complex
social issues quickly, especially in view of the financial
constraints faced by countries like Sri Lanka. (Eddleton et al.,
2003)
Given growing public outcry, the Sri Lanka's Ministry of
Health finally released the final WHO Report on CKDu in
early April 2013 (WHO, n.d.). Following recommendations
in the Report, the Ministry of Agriculture banned the impor-
tation of the pesticides--Carbofuran, Chlorpyrifos, Propanil
and Carbaryl--on April 8, 2013, and called for the reduction
of the use of triple super phosphate fertilizer (ColomboPage,
2013). However, the battle over agrochemicals is far from
over. The Registrar of Pesticides has not issued any "guide-
lines" on the issue and the banned pesticides are still avail-
able in the market and being used by farmers. Many of the
leading agrochemical companies are interpreting the ban
only as a "temporary measure" (Jayawardana, 2013). CKD
and the battle over pesticides are not restricted to Sri Lanka's
dry zone agricultural region. These are global problems
(Bandarage, 2013a).
A Global Problem
Like in Sri Lanka, today, the kidney disease epidemics in the
Pacific Coast of Nicaragua and in Uddanam in the remote
agricultural belt of Andhra Pradesh, India are also classified
as mysterious diseases of "unknown etiology." According to
the WHO, more than 16,000 men died of kidney failure in
Central America between 2005 and 2009 (Chavkin, 2012a;
Conner, 2013). In Uddanam as much as 24% to 37% of the
population in some villages are estimated to be affected by
the disease (Chavkin, 2012b). The CKD epidemics in Sri
Lanka, Nicaragua, and India have important features in com-
mon: The victims are farm workers; all suffer from "a rare
form of kidney damage known as tubule-interstitial disease,
consistent with severe dehydration and toxic poisoning"; few
suffer from diabetes and hypertension, common risk factors
for kidney disease (Chavkin, 2012b). CKD activists in
Nicaragua see the sugar industry where most of the victims
work as a root cause of the disease. According to the trade
group for Nicaragua's sugar companies, however, "the agri-
cultural sugar industry in Nicaragua has no responsibility
whatsoever for the spreading disease" (Aleman &
Wessenstein, 2012). In 2006, the International Finance
Group, the private sector arm of the World Bank, provided
more than US$100 million to two privately owned sugar
plantations in Nicaragua to promote sugar cultivation and
biofuel production (Aleman & Wessenstein, 2012; Sanders
& Seville, 2012). The workers at Ingenio San Antonio, one
of the plantations funded by the Bank, however, have been
protesting for close to a decade alleging that pesticide use
and labor practices of the plantation have caused the disease
(Chavkin, 2012a).
The search for causes and solutions to CKD whether in
Sri Lanka, Nicaragua, India, or elsewhere must go beyond
the bio-medical focus on the delineation of illness and treat-
ment. To understand root causes, it is imperative to consider
the industrialization of agriculture and the "consolidation of
the entire food chain" by transnational corporations (Pesticide
Action Network, 2013a). Through privatization of resources
and technological domination, corporate control is being
extended beyond the food chain to all of nature. The
10 SAGE Open
long-term result is not the promised progress and prosperity
for all but structural violence--environmental degradation,
poverty, ill health, and loss of livelihoods for the majority.
These issues are discussed in the author's book Sustainability
and Well-Being: The Middle Path to Environment, Society
and the Economy (Bandarage, 2013c).
In 1962, Rachel Carson warned in Silent Spring that "for
the first time in the history of the world, every human being
is now subjected to contact with dangerous chemicals from
the moment of conception until death" (Benson, 2011;
Carson, 1987). Today, the cycle of poison created by chemi-
cal agriculture envelops almost all life on earth--water, soil,
air, plants, and animals--threatening the very survival of
humans and the health of ecosystems. The Sri Lankan
Government's recent ban (August 2013) of imported milk
powder from New Zealand that was allegedly contaminated
with dicyandamide (DCD) is a case in point. An editorial in
the Sri Lankan newspaper, Daily Mirror, voices growing
public fear of poisoned food and drink when it says that
Hundreds of people may be silently dying due to a daily intake
of poisoned or polluted food. Even post-mortem examinations
may not reveal the root cause . . . the verdict will be recorded as
death due to natural causes. They are far from natural. In addition
to the use of agro-chemicals, trans-national companies have
invaded Sri Lanka with their genetically modified foods and
terminator technology . . . The long-term effect may be the
destruction of an agriculture system that has been part of our
civilisation and culture for thousands of years. The . . . solution
. . . is for the Government . . . to work out an effective national
policy on food and nutrition. (Daily Mirror, 2013)
Policies on food and nutrition at the national level are not
sufficient. The elimination of CKD and contamination of food
and water call for a transformation of consciousness and an
integrated global policy approach (Bandarage, 2013c). CKD
is a complex issue requiring multi-dimensional, short- and
long-term approaches. The struggle against toxic chemicals
represents a challenge to the dominant model of development
and its emphasis on economic growth and profits over envi-
ronmental sustainability and human well-being. It calls for a
fundamental shift from the dominant individualistic and com-
petitive approach toward a partnership approach to human
interaction with nature and with each other. The global move-
ment away from industrialized agriculture, imported and fast
foods toward organic agriculture, "food sovereignty," and
"slow food" are integral aspects of this shift (Amin, 2011;
International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements,
2013; Slow Food International, 2013)
Toward Sustainability and Well-Being
Unlike agribusiness, which pursues a fragmented, highly
techno-bureaucratic approach, organic agriculture is an inte-
grated approach that helps maintain an appropriate agroeco-
logical balance between the soil, water, people, animals, and
insects. It depends on the use of local inputs such as indige-
nous seed varieties, compost, animal manure, and the culti-
vation of a diversity of crops. Organic agriculture also relies
on the accumulated knowledge and skills of local farming
traditions but can be dynamic and adapted to changing needs
and circumstances (J. M. R. S. Bandara, 2009).
It may not be necessary to dismiss all aspects of industri-
alized agriculture or attempt to return to romanticized pre-
modern agriculture. A range of alternatives to the chemical
led approach to pest management can be considered. One is
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) encouraged by the well-
known international NGO, Care International in Sri Lanka
(Care International, 1997; Uggalla, 1997). IPM seeks to
maximize the use of safe, cheap, and simple pest control
techniques by including organic traditional methods with the
safest possible use of chemical pesticides where necessary.
Another is Effective Microorganism (EM), a multi-purpose
organic fertilizer and pesticide. It has been tried with much
success in IPM projects in Sri Lanka including control of the
brown hopper, which could not be contained by chemical
pesticides (Bandarage, 1998; Uggalla, 1997).
Given farmers' fear of economic survival and reluctance
to give up chemical inputs, the switch to organic fertilizers
and pesticides must involve a gradual process including
research, advocacy, and public education. It calls for partner-
ship among farmer producers, consumers, civil society
groups, the government, intergovernmental organizations,
such as the WHO and companies that are genuinely willing
to support sustainable agriculture. Sri Lankan companies can
play an important role in developing local organic alterna-
tives to imported agrochemicals and food products, such as
milk powder.
As shortages, prices, and contamination of food increases,
more and more people across the world are joining the sus-
tainable agriculture movement. In Sri Lanka, a number of
international, national, and local governmental and non-gov-
ernmental organizations are pursuing organic agricultural
ventures. Efforts are under way in CKD prevalent areas to
educate farming communities especially the youth on pesti-
cides, kidney disease, and the need to shift to organic agricul-
ture and safe use of water (Jayasumana, 2012). The concept
of "learning through doing" relies on farmers'ability to make
appropriate decisions about pest management based on their
own observations and discussions with each other and train-
ers (van den Berg, 2004). The objectives are to minimize use
of chemical pesticides, increase agricultural yields and
income of farmers, and restore their enthusiasm, self-confi-
dence, and self-respect. Indeed, efforts to eradicate CKD in
Sri Lanka and elsewhere are integral aspects of the global
social movement toward environmental sustainability and
human well-being.
