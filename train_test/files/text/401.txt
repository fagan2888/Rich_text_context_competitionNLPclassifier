Abstract--Recent data suggest that visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure is associated with stroke incidence. Correlates
of increased visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure and the relationship between variability and all-cause mortality
were examined using data on US adults 20 years of age from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (n956). Three consecutive blood pressure readings were taken during 3 separate study visits from 1988 to
1994. Based on the mean of the second and third measurements from each visit, visit-to-visit blood pressure variability
for each participant was defined using the standard deviation and coefficient of variation across visits. Mortality was
assessed through December 31, 2006 (median follow-up14 years; n240 deaths). The mean of the standard deviation
for systolic blood pressure across visits was 7.7 mm Hg. After multivariable adjustment, older age, female gender,
history of myocardial infarction, higher mean systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, and use of angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with higher standard deviation in systolic blood pressure. The
multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated with a standard deviation of systolic blood
pressure of 4.80 to 8.34 mm Hg and 8.35 mm Hg, versus 4.80 mm Hg, were 1.57 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.18) and 1.50
(95% CI, 1.03 to 2.18), respectively. Results were similar when coefficient of variation for systolic blood pressure was
evaluated. Visit-to-visit variability for diastolic blood pressure was not associated with mortality. In this population-
based study of US adults, higher levels of short-term visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure were associated
with increased all-cause mortality. (Hypertension. 2011;57:160-166.)  Online Data Supplement

The prognostic value of blood pressure is based mainly on
measurements obtained in a clinic setting, typically
averaged over several visits.1­3 Visit-to-visit variability of
blood pressure is often dismissed as random fluctuation
around a patient's true basal blood pressure and is thought to
be a limitation of measuring blood pressure in the office
setting.4,5 However, recent data suggest that visit-to-visit
variability of blood pressure is reproducible and not a random
phenomenon.6
The concept that variability in blood pressure has a
prognostic value for cardiovascular events is not new.7­10 In
1993, investigators demonstrated that higher diurnal variabil-
ity of blood pressure assessed by ambulatory monitoring over
24 hours was associated with an increased risk for left
ventricular hypertrophy during 7 years of follow-up.7 In
2010, secondary analyses of several randomized controlled
trials demonstrated a strong association between longer-term
variability in systolic blood pressure and stroke and coronary
heart disease risk.11 In these studies, blood pressure variabil-
ity was assessed across multiple visits (ie, visit-to-visit
variability) conducted over periods of 12 to 36 months.
Data on visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure have
been derived primarily from select populations, mostly sec-
ondary analyses of randomized controlled trials including
patients with or at high risk for vascular disease. Scarce data
are available on the correlates and prognostic significance
of higher visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure in the
general population. Therefore, we analyzed data from the
population-based Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) to determine factors
associated with higher visit-to-visit variability of blood
pressure. In addition, we examined the association between

mortality.
Methods
NHANES III was a stratified, multistage probability survey designed
to select a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized
US population.12 NHANES III consisted of an in-home interview
with blood pressure measurements and a visit to a mobile examina-
tion center for a medical evaluation including additional blood
pressure measurements. Overall, 18 825 adults 20 years of age
completed the NHANES III interview and examination between
1988 and 1994. A sample of 5% (n2174) of these participants
were selected to attend a third visit at the mobile examination center,
during which time the complete medical evaluation including blood
pressure measurements was repeated. We limited the current analy-
ses to NHANES III participants who were selected for the third study
visit and excluded 1040 participants without 3 blood pressure
measurements at each of the 3 NHANES III study visits. In addition,
178 participants whose blood pressure was not measured in the same
arm at all 3 visits were excluded. After these exclusions, a total of
956 NHANES III participants were included in the current analyses.
Among those selected to attend the third visit, participants included
(n956) versus excluded (n1143) in the current analyses had
similar mean systolic blood pressure levels during the in-home visit
(127.7 mm Hg and 127.5 mm Hg, respectively; P0.804) and
during the first visit to the mobile examination center (125.3 mm Hg
and 123.6 mm Hg, respectively; P0.061). The protocol for
NHANES III was approved by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention institu-
tional review board. All participants gave informed consent.
Baseline Data Collection
Demographic and health-related information was collected using a
standardized questionnaire during the in-home interview. The use of
antihypertensive medications was ascertained via self-report with
classes of antihypertensive medications determined through pill
bottle review. Antihypertensive medication classes considered for
analysis included angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide-type diuretics.
Other classes had too few individuals taking them to provide stable
results. During the medical evaluation, height and weight were
measured and body mass index was calculated. Blood and spot urine
specimens were obtained and processed for analysis. Diabetes
mellitus was defined as a fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL, a
nonfasting plasma glucose 200 mg/dL, or a self-reported history of
diabetes with concurrent use of antidiabetes medication. Serum
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels 2 mg/L were defined as elevated.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using
the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation,
and reduced eGFR was defined as levels 60 mL/min/1.73m2.13­15
Albuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin to urinary creatinine
ratio 30 mg/g.15
Blood Pressure Measurements
Blood pressure was measured 3 times during the in-home interview
and 3 additional times during each of the 2 visits to the mobile
examination center. The first visit to the mobile examination center
was scheduled within 1 month of the in-home interview, and the
second visit was scheduled on completion of the first visit. The
median duration between consecutive mobile examination center
visits was 17 days (minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 48 days).
The same standardized protocol and equipment were used for
measuring blood pressure during the in-home and mobile examina-
tion clinic visits. Blood pressure was measured by a trained research
assistant during the in-home visit and by a trained clinician during
the visit to the mobile examination clinic. Additional details regard-
ing blood pressure measurement and quality control procedures are
provided in the NHANES III manual of operations. For systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, separately, the second and third measure-
ments from each visit were averaged. Using the mean systolic blood
pressure from each visit, the standard deviation and coefficient of
variation of systolic blood pressure across study visits were calcu-
lated. The standard deviation and coefficient of variation of diastolic
blood pressure across study visits were also calculated.
Mortality Follow-Up
Adult NHANES III participants were followed for mortality through
December 31, 2006. Probabilistic matching was used to link
NHANES III participants with the National Death Index to ascertain
vital status. Matching was based on 12 identifiers for each participant
(eg, Social Security number, sex, and date of birth). Identical
matching methodology applied to the NHANES I Epidemiological
Follow-Up Study for validation purposes found that 96.1% of
deceased participants and 99.4% of living participants were correctly
classified.16
Statistical Analysis
Two sets of analyses were conducted, one for standard deviation of
systolic blood pressure across study visits and the second for
coefficient of variation. The analysis for standard deviation of
systolic blood pressure is described below with identical methods
used for the analysis of coefficient of variation of systolic blood
pressure. Baseline participant characteristics were calculated by
tertile of standard deviation of systolic blood pressure. Tests for
linear trend across tertiles were calculated by including the median of
each tertile as a continuous variable in linear or logistic regression
models. The association between participant characteristics with
standard deviation of systolic blood pressure was assessed using
linear regression. Characteristics investigated include age, sex, race­
ethnicity, physical inactivity, current smoking, body mass index,
total cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, reduced eGFR, albuminuria,
elevated CRP, history of myocardial infarction (MI), history of
stroke, mean systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, and antihy-
pertensive medication drug class. Initial regression models included
adjustment for age, sex, and race­ethnicity. A subsequent model
included all variables associated (P0.05) with the standard devia-
tion of systolic blood pressure in the age-, sex-, and race­ethnicity-
adjusted models.
Next, hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated with tertiles
of the standard deviation of systolic blood pressure, with the lowest
tertile serving as the referent, were initially calculated unadjusted
and after age, sex, and race­ethnicity adjustment. A subsequent
model included adjustment for age, sex, race, and variables associ-
ated with standard deviation of systolic blood pressure in the age-,
sex-, and race­ethnicity-adjusted models as described above. To
account for potential differences in blood pressure resulting from
measurements taken in the home versus clinic setting, as a sensitivity
analysis, a final regression model included adjustment for the
difference in mean systolic blood pressure between the in-home visit
and the first mobile examination clinic visit. In addition, secondary
analyses restricted to participants not taking antihypertensive medi-
cation were conducted. Too few participants were taking antihyper-
tensive medications (n170) to provide valid results among this
group.
The association of standard deviation of systolic blood pressure,
modeled as a continuous variable, with all-cause mortality was
evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models and restricted
quadratic splines with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of
the standard deviation (2.2 mm Hg, 6.4 mm Hg, and 15.1 mm Hg) of
systolic blood pressure distribution. For spline analysis, the 10th,
50th, and 90th percentiles of the coefficient of variation of systolic
blood pressure were 1.9%, 5.1%, and 12.0%, respectively.
Analyses were repeated for tertiles of standard deviation and
coefficient of variation of diastolic blood pressure with all-cause
mortality. The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models
was confirmed using Schoenfeld residuals. All analyses were con-
ducted without sampling weights as recommended for NHANES III
second examination data using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute).

Results
Correlates of Visit-to-Visit Variability in Systolic
Blood Pressure
The mean of the standard deviation and coefficient of
variation of systolic blood pressure across study visits was
7.7 mm Hg and 6.1%, respectively. Higher tertiles of the
standard deviation of systolic blood pressure across visits
were associated with older age, higher total cholesterol levels,
mean systolic blood pressure, and mean pulse pressure (Table
1). In addition, individuals in the higher tertiles of standard
deviation of systolic blood pressure across study visits were
more likely to be physically inactive, have diabetes, reduced
eGFR, albuminuria, elevated CRP, a history of MI or stroke,
and to use ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel
blockers, or thiazide-type diuretics. Characteristics of
NHANES III participants by tertile of coefficient of variation
of systolic blood pressure across study visits are provided in
Table I, available in an online supplement at http://hyper.
ahajournals.org.
The factors associated with standard deviation of systolic
blood pressure across visits after age, sex, and race­ethnicity
and multivariable adjustment are shown in Table 2. In a
multivariable model, older age, female sex, having a history
of MI, taking ACE inhibitors, and mean systolic blood
pressure and pulse pressure were associated with higher
standard deviation of systolic blood pressure across study
visits. Characteristics associated with higher coefficient of
variation of systolic blood pressure across study visits after
age, sex, and race­ethnicity and multivariable adjustment are
provided in Table II, available in an online supplement at
http://hyper.ahajournals.org.
Relationship Between Visit-to-Visit Variability in
Systolic Blood Pressure and All-Cause Mortality
Over a median of 14 years of follow-up, 240 (25.1%) of the
NHANES III sample included in this analysis died. The
unadjusted and age-, sex-, and race­ethnicity-adjusted hazard
ratios for all-cause mortality increased across tertiles for both
standard deviation and coefficient of variation of systolic
blood pressure (Table 3). After adjustment for age, sex,
race­ethnicity, history of MI, mean systolic blood pressure
and pulse pressure, and ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, calcium
channel blocker, and thiazide-type diuretic use, the hazard
ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.18)
and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.03 to 2.18) for the middle and highest
versus lowest tertile of standard deviation of systolic blood
pressure (P trend0.064), respectively, and 1.55 (95% CI,

and highest versus lowest tertiles of coefficient of variation of
systolic blood pressure (P trend0.040). After additional
adjustment for change in systolic blood pressure between the
in-home visit and the first clinic visit, the hazard ratios for
all-cause mortality were markedly similar (1.57 [95% CI,
1.07 to 2.30] and 1.55 [95% CI, 1.06 to 2.26] for the middle
and highest versus lowest tertile for standard deviation, respec-
tively, and 1.55 [95% CI, 1.09 to 2.22] and 1.54 [95% CI, 1.09
to 2.19], respectively, for the middle and highest versus lowest
tertile for the coefficient of variation). In addition, among
participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the hazard
ratios for all-cause mortality associated with the middle and
highest tertiles were 1.77 (95% CI, 1.13 to 2.77) and 1.56 (95%
CI, 1.00 to 2.44), respectively, for standard deviation, and 1.60
(95% CI, 1.04 to 2.45) and 1.40 (95% CI, 0.91 to 2.14),
respectively, for the coefficient of variation.
Modeled as a continuous variable, the multivariable adjusted
hazard ratio for all-cause mortality increased progressively from
0 to 10 mm Hg standard deviation of systolic blood pressure and
remained elevated, with wide CIs that included the null, at levels
10 mm Hg (Figure, top). The multivariable adjusted hazard
ratio for all-cause mortality increased continuously and linearly
across the full range of the coefficient of variation of systolic
blood pressure (Figure, bottom panel).
Relationship Between Visit-to-Visit Variability in
Diastolic Blood Pressure and All-Cause Mortality
The mean of the standard deviation and the coefficient of
variation across study visits for diastolic blood pressure were
5.8 mm Hg and 8.1%, respectively. The unadjusted hazard
ratios for mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.68 to 1.28) and 1.09
(95% CI, 0.93 to 1.27) for participants in the middle (3.70 to
6.49 mm Hg) and highest (6.50 mm Hg) versus the lowest
tertile (3.70 mm Hg) of standard deviation in diastolic
blood pressure (Table III, available in an online supplement at
http://hyper.ahajournals.org.). In addition, unadjusted hazard
ratios for mortality were 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.37) and 1.10
(95% CI, 0.94 to 1.28) for participants in the middle (5.1% to
8.7%) and highest (8.8%) versus the lowest tertile (5.1%)
of coefficient of variation in diastolic blood pressure. No
association between variability in diastolic blood pressure
and mortality was present after adjustment for age, sex,
race­ethnicity, or other potential confounders.
Discussion
In this population-based study of US adults, older age, female
sex, a history of MI, and ACE inhibitor use were associated
with higher variability of blood pressure across study visits.
In addition, higher visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood
pressure was associated with increased mortality risk over
14-year follow-up. A significant association was not present
for visit-to-visit variability in diastolic blood pressure.
Several hypotheses have been proposed for mechanisms
underlying higher levels of visit-to-visit variability in systolic
blood pressure.6,17,18 It has been suggested that arterial stiff-
ness may be one factor leading to higher blood pressure
variability.19 In the present study, pulse pressure and older
age (both directly associated with arterial stiffness) were
independently associated with greater visit-to-visit variability
in systolic blood pressure.20,21 Further, it has been suggested
that increased blood pressure variability may additionally be
a manifestation of baroreflex regulation of blood pressure.3,22
However, previous evidence indicates that decreased (not
increased) heart rate variability is associated with an in-
creased risk of mortality, suggesting that heart rate variability
does not play a role in the relationship between blood
pressure variability and mortality in the current study.23
Although some have suggested that higher blood pressure
variability might identify people with subclinical inflamma-
tion,24 elevated CRP was not associated with increased
visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure in the
current analysis. Because CRP was measured using a low-
sensitivity assay in NHANES III, this possible mechanism
warrants additional study.
Use of antihypertensive medications is a potential deter-
minant of variability in blood pressure. A recent meta-anal-
ysis of data from randomized trials comparing antihyperten-

sive regimens (with each other and with placebo) suggested
that use of calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuret-
ics leads to lower variability in blood pressure, whereas use of
ACE inhibitors and beta blockers leads to greater variability.25 In
the current study, after age, sex, and race­ethnicity adjust-
ment, taking antihypertensive medications (regardless of
class) was associated with higher visit-to-visit variability in
systolic blood pressure. Although ACE inhibitors were asso-
ciated with higher blood pressure variability after multivari-
able adjustment, no differences in visit-to-visit variability
were present for the other antihypertensive medication
classes. The limited sample size of participants taking anti-
hypertensive medication precluded a direct head-to-head
comparison of drug classes.
One possible factor to explain the link between antihyper-
tensive medication use and higher visit-to-visit blood pres-
sure variability is low medication adherence. In the current
study, an association between visit-to-visit variability and
increased risk for all-cause mortality was present among indi-
viduals not taking antihypertensive medication, suggesting ad-
herence is not responsible for this association. Nonetheless,
future studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms
underlying visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure
associated with antihypertensive medication use, different
classes of medication, and adherence.
Evidence suggests that visit-to-visit variability in blood
pressure is reproducible and not a random phenomenon. In
the UK-TIA study, the intraclass correlation coefficient for
the standard deviation of systolic blood pressure across the
first 4 visits and subsequent 4 visits was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.19
to 0.30).6 The intraclass correlation coefficient for the coef-
ficient of variation of systolic blood pressure was also found
to be reproducible (intraclass correlation coefficient0.14;
95% CI, 0.08 to 0.20; P0.001). Reproducibility in visit-to-
visit variability in systolic blood pressure was also present in
the European Carotid Surgery Trial.6 In these 2 previous
studies, blood pressure was based on a single measurement at
each visit. Having multiple blood pressure measurements at

each visit, as was available in the current study, should result
in a higher degree of reproducibility in the level of visit-to-
visit variability in blood pressure.
There is some previous evidence to suggest that visit-to-
visit variability in systolic blood pressure has prognostic
value, independent of average blood pressure.11,17,22,26 In a
study of 1433 men from the Honolulu Heart Program,
visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure was asso-
ciated with incident coronary heart disease events, even after
controlling for potential confounders including average sys-
tolic blood pressure across study visits.27 In a recent publi-
cation including the secondary analysis of several random-
ized controlled trials, higher visit-to-visit variability in
systolic blood pressure was associated with an increased
incidence of stroke in a cohort of subjects who had previously
experienced a transient ischemic attack.11 Higher visit-to-visit
variability in systolic blood pressure also was associated with
stroke and coronary events in treated hypertensive patients
enrolled in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial
Blood Pressure Lowering Arm.25 The results of the current
study are consistent with the findings from these previous
studies and extend them in several important ways. The
current study population included a multiethnic sample of
patients taking and not taking antihypertensive medications,
and, unlike most previous studies on visit-to-visit variability
in blood pressure, participants were not randomized to
interventions.
In the current study, no association was present between
visit-to-visit variability in diastolic blood pressure and all-
cause mortality. This is consistent with previous research.11,27
For example, in the Honolulu Heart Program, variance of
diastolic blood pressure across 4 visits was not associated
with subsequent coronary heart disease incidence.27 In addi-
tion, in the UK-TIA study, the visit-to-visit variability in
diastolic blood pressure was not associated with stroke, and
an association was present only in the highest deciles in the
Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial Blood Pressure
Lowering Arm.11
This study should be interpreted in the context of several
possible limitations. Most notably, the first set of blood
pressure measurements occurred during an in-home exami-
nation, whereas the latter 2 sets of measurements occurred in
a medical evaluation conducted in a mobile examination
center. In addition, the in-home blood pressure measurements
were obtained by a research assistant, whereas the clinic
measurements were obtained by a physician. However, the
study protocol and equipment used were identical for all
blood pressure measurements, and adjustment for the change
in blood pressure between measurements taken in the home
and clinic setting did not effect the association of visit-to-visit
variability with mortality. Another potential limitation is that
blood pressure measurements were available at only 3 time
points. It would be valuable to calculate variability, with
more visits occurring over a longer time period. Finally, only
a subsample of participants were asked to attend the second
clinic examination. Three blood pressure measurements were
available for only 956 of the 2174 participants who were
asked to complete the second clinic examination. The small
sample size prevented us from conducting subgroup analyses
and investigating cause-specific mortality. Given its strong
association with age, visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood
pressure may prove to have greater prognostic importance
among older adults. This should be addressed in future
studies.
Perspectives
Visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure can be
identified in clinical practice, and the natural assumption may
be that it is the result of measurement error. However, the
findings from the present study suggest that such variability is
associated with increased mortality. Additional research is
needed to confirm these results, identify the putative mech-
anisms involved in this association, and evaluate approaches
to reduce visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure and its
clinical sequelae.
