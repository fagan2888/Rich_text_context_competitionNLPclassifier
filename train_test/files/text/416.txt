OBJECTIVE -- We reported strong relations between serum concentrations of persistent
organic pollutants (POPs), especially organochlorine (OC) pesticides or nondioxin-like poly-
chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and prevalence of diabetes in a U.S population with background
exposure to POPs. Here, we investigated POPs and insulin resistance, a frequent pathogenic
precursor of type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Serum POPs and homeostasis model assess-
ment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were investigated cross-sectionally in 749 nondiabetic
participants aged 20 years. Nineteen POPs in five subclasses were selected, detectable in 60%
of participants.
RESULTS -- Among subclasses, OC pesticides were most strongly associated with HOMA-IR.
Adjusted geometric means of HOMA were 3.27, 3.36, 3.48, and 3.85 (P for trend 0.01) across
quartiles of OC pesticides. The relationship strengthened with increasing HOMA-IR percentile:
adjusted odds ratios comparing the highest versus lowest POPs quartile were 1.8 for being
50th percentile of HOMA-IR, 4.4 for being 75th percentile, and 7.5 for being 90th per-
centile. Associations with elevated HOMA-IR appeared to be specific to oxychlordane and
trans-nonachlor but also were found for two nondioxin-like PCBs. No HOMA-IR associations
were seen in the other three POP subclasses. The association between OC pesticides and
HOMA-IR tended to strengthen as waist circumference increased, with no apparent association
in the lowest quartile of OC pesticide concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS -- These findings, coupled with those concerning diabetes prevalence,
suggest that OC pesticides and nondioxin-like PCBs may be associated with type 2 diabetes risk
by increasing insulin resistance, and POPs may interact with obesity to increase the risk of type
2 diabetes.

Recently, we reported striking dose-
response relations between serum
concentrations of persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) and prevalence of dia-
betes in a random sample of the U.S pop-
ulation with background environmental
exposure to POPs (1). Even though all six
POPs (detectable among at least 80% of
study subjects) were associated positively
with diabetes, the POPs belonging to sub-
classes organochlorine (OC) pesticides
(trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane) or
nondioxin-like polychlorinated biphe-
nyls (PCBs) (PCB153) were most strongly
associated with diabetes, with odds ratios
(ORs) for prevalent diabetes for those in
the top decile of detectables compared
with nondetectables of 11.5, 6.5, and 6.8,
respectively. Furthermore, the prevalence
of diabetes was quite low among subjects
in the lowest category of POPs, even in
subjects with BMI 30 kg/m2 (1), sug-
gesting that POPs stored in adipose tissue
may contribute strongly to the pathogen-
esis of diabetes (2,3).
Virtually all patients with type 2 dia-
betes are insulin resistant (4), and in-
creased insulin resistance normally
precedes the onset of diabetes by one to
two decades (5,6). Thus, if the strong as-
sociations of POPs with diabetes shown in
our previous study were causal, it would
be reasonable to expect similar relations
between POPs and insulin resistance,
even in the pre-diabetic stage, as we re-
ported for POPs and diabetes prevalence.
Thus, we investigated the relation of se-
rum concentrations of POPs with insulin
resistance among nondiabetic subjects
using the same dataset as in our previous
study (1).

plex, multistage probability sample. De-
tails of the NHANES protocol and all
testing procedures are available elsewhere
(7,8). Serum concentrations of biologi-
cally important various POPs or their me-
tabolites were measured in subsamples of
the NHANES 1999­2002 surveys (9).
The NHANES standardized home in-
terview was followed by a detailed physi-
cal examination in a mobile evaluation
clinic or the participant's home. Venous
blood samples were collected and shipped
weekly at 20°C. POPs were measured by
high-resolution gas chromatography/high-
resolution mass spectrometry using iso-
tope dilution for quantification. All these
analytes were measured in 5 ml of se-
rum using a modification of the method of
Turner et al. (10). The POPs were re-
ported on a lipid-adjusted basis using
concentrations of serum total cholesterol
and triglycerides. Plasma glucose was
measured with a hexokinase enzymatic
reference method (COBAS MIRA; Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and serum
insulin by means of a radioimmunoassay
(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Swe-
den). Insulin resistance was estimated us-
ing the homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA) method calculated by the fol-
lowing equation: (fasting insulin [mU/l]
 fasting glucose [mmol/l]/22.5).
Although 49 POPs were measured in
both NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­
2002, to avoid bias in estimation among
those below the limit of detection (LOD),
we selected the 19 POPs for which at least
60% of study subjects had concentrations
more than the LOD: three polychlori-
nated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), three
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs),
four dioxin-like PCBs, five nondioxin-like
PCBs, and four OC pesticides. There were
852 study participants aged 20 years
with information on both fasting morning
samples and serum concentrations of the
19 selected POPs. After excluding 103
subjects who had diabetes, the final sam-
ple size was 749.
For each POP, subjects with serum
concentrations under the LOD were re-
garded as the reference group and subjects
with detectable values were categorized
by cutoff points of 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentile values. To yield a cumulative
measure of three PCDDs, we summed the
ranks of the three POPs that belong to the
PCDDs. The summary values were cate-
gorized by cutoff points of 25th, 50th,
and 75th percentile values. We assigned
and cumulated POP subclasses similarly
for the three PCDFs, the four dioxin-like
PCBs, the five nondioxin-like PCBs, and
the four OC pesticides.
In the previous study (1), we selected
the six POPs that were detected among
80% of study subjects because the selec-
tion of a true reference group with truly
low levels of POPs would be very impor-
tant to get valid risk estimates. As all six
POPs were positively associated with dia-
betes, we combined the ranks of the six
POPs to calculate a summary marker of
six POPs. However, it would be more rea-
sonable to summarize only POPs with
similar physical and chemical properties
(i.e., specific POPs belonging to the same
subclasses of POPs). For this purpose, we
selected 19 POPs that were detected
among at least 60% of study subjects and
examined the associations of POPs and
HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
within five POP subclasses. As a last step,
we analyzed specific POPs belonging to
those subclasses of POPs that were signif-
icantly associated with HOMA-IR.
It is important to note that subjects
with serum concentrations under the
LOD of a specific POP do not necessarily
have zero values. They were nondetect-
able due to limited amounts of serum
used for POP measurement. If sufficient
amounts of serum were used, POPs
would be detectable in almost all humans.
However, as it is unlikely that the amount
of serum used for POP measurement dif-
fers depending on their actual serum lev-
els of POPs, we could assume that on
average true serum concentrations of
POPs among subjects with nondetectable
POPs were lower than those among sub-
jects with detectable POPs.
First, the associations of categories of
POPs with HOMA were analyzed using
linear regression with continuous loga-
rithmic-transformed HOMA-IR values.
Next, we assessed whether HOMA-IR dif-
ferences across POP categories expanded
at the higher percentiles of HOMA-IR. To
do this, we estimated the OR of having
HOMA-IR above a series of cut points
across categories of POPs. The HOMA-IR
cut points considered were the 50th per-
centile (2.34), the 75th percentile
(3.53), and the 90th percentile (5.06).
The use of several cutoffs allowed us to
look at whether the HOMA-IR/POP associ-
ation got stronger as HOMA-IR increased.
Potential confounders were age, sex,
race/ethnicity, poverty income ratio, BMI,
waist circumference, cigarette smoking
(never, former, or current), cotinine con-
centrations (ng/ml), alcohol consumption
(g/day), and leisure time physical activity
(vigorous, moderate, or none). We substi-
tuted median values of study subjects for
missing poverty income ratio, BMI, waist
circumference, cotinine concentrations,
or alcohol consumption in 111 subjects;
exclusion of these individuals did not
change any conclusions.
All statistical analyses were per-
formed with SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 9.0.
Estimates of the main results were calcu-
lated accounting for stratification and
clustering (11), adjusting for age, race and
ethnicity, and poverty income ratio in-
stead of using sample weights; this adjust-
ment has been regarded as a good
compromise between efficiency and bias
(11,12). As results were very similar with
SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 9.0, we present the
results based on SAS 9.1.
RESULTS -- The sample of 749 partic-
ipants included 46.3% men and 49.7%
white. Mean  SD for age was 48.2  18.9
years (range 20­85). Age was the stron-
gest and most important correlate of se-
rum concentrations of all five subclasses
of POPs with correlation coefficients from
0.46 to 0.76. After adjusting for age, there
were positive pairwise correlations
among serum concentrations of the five
subclasses of POPs with correlation coef-
ficients from 0.24 to 0.74. Men had low
serum concentrations of PCDDs and di-
oxin-like PCBs. White subjects had lower
concentrations of OC pesticides but
higher concentrations of PCDFs or PCBs.
Those with higher income had lower con-
centrations of OC pesticides but higher
PCBs. Current smokers tended to have
lower concentrations of most POPs. Alco-
hol consumption was associated posi-
tively with PCBs, while exercise was
inversely associated with OC pesticides.
OC pesticides were positively associated
with BMI, while nondioxin-like PCBs
showed an inverse association with BMI.
Within the whole sample, arithmetic
means and SDs of fasting plasma glucose,
insulin, and HOMA-IR were 95.0  10.9
mg/dl, 12.0  8.7 mU/l, and 2.86  2.17
mU/l  mmol/l, respectively. Among five
subclasses of POPs, only OC pesticides
were strongly associated with HOMA-IR
amongthesenondiabeticsubjects(Table1).
Adjusted geometric means of HOMA-IR
were 3.27, 3.36, 3.48, and 3.85 (P for trend
0.01) across quartiles of OC pesticides.
Table 2 shows adjusted ORs of having
higher HOMA-IR associated with quar-
tiles of five subclasses of POPs. OC pesti-
cides were strongly associated with the
increased risk for being above the 90th

percentile of HOMA-IR; adjusted ORs
were 1.0, 1.4, 2.9, and 7.5 (P for trend
0.01). Among other POPs, both PCDDs
and nondioxin-like PCBs showed positive
trends even though they failed to reach
statistical significances. When we used
lower cutoff points of HOMA-IR, such as
75th percentile or 50th percentile, only
OC pesticides were significantly associ-
ated with HOMA-IR, but the strengths of
associations tended to be weaker than
those of 90th percentile. When all five
subclasses of POPs were included in one
model, only OC pesticides were significant.
Among four specific POPs belonging
to OC pesticides, both oxychlordane and
trans-nonachlor were most strongly asso-
ciated with the risk of elevated HOMA-IR
(Table 3). When we further investigated
eight POPs belonging to nondioxin-like
PCBs or PCDDs (which showed nonsig-
nificant positive trends with the outcome
of HOMA-IR 90th percentile), both
PCB170 and PCB187 were significantly
associated with HOMA-IR. On the other
hand, three specific POPs (PCB153,
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin, and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorod-
ibenzo-p-dioxin) positively associated
with diabetes in a previous study (1) were
not significantly associated with HOMA-IR.
In all analyses, we further considered
self-reported weight loss in the 1 or 10
years before examination as possible con-
founders because weight loss was a strong
confounder in the associations between
POPs and diabetes in our previous study
(13). However, the adjustment for weight
loss did not change the results (data not
shown).
We examined the interaction be-
tween POPs and waist circumference on
the risk for insulin resistance, which was
motivated by an apparent interaction be-
tween POPs and BMI on the risk of prev-
alent diabetes in our previous study (1).
Similar to those findings, Fig. 1 shows
that the association between serum con-
centrations of OC pesticides and the risk
of higher HOMA-IR tended to be stronger
as waist circumference increased even
though the P for interaction was not sig-
nificant (P for interaction  0.58). Inter-
estingly, waist circumference was not
associated with elevated HOMA-IR
among subjects with low concentrations
of OC pesticides.
CONCLUSIONS -- Using a cross-
sectional design, the present study found
serum concentrations of OC pesticides to
be strongly and positively associated with
insulin resistance among nondiabetic
subjects. Coupled with the findings of our
previous study on the associations be-
tween POPs and diabetes (1), the current
results suggest that the background envi-
ronmental exposure to some POPs, espe-
cially OC pesticides, may be critically
involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes
through a pathway involving insulin re-
sistance. Among several OC pesticides,
both oxychlordane (metabolites of chlor-
dane) and trans-nonachlor (impurity of
chlordane) were most strongly associated
with insulin resistance. On the other
hand, other classes of POPs, such as
PCDDs, PCDF, or PCBs, were not
strongly associated with insulin resistance
among nondiabetic subjects. However,
when specific individual POPs were ex-
amined, some POPs belonging to non-
dioxin-like PCBs were associated with
higher values of HOMA-IR.
In our previous study on the associa-
tion between POPs and diabetes (1), we
reported strong dose-response relations
of diabetes with all six POPs studied,
which included members of the sub-
classes of PCDDs, nondioxin-like PCBs,
and OC pesticides. Serum concentrations
of most POPs in the general population
are highly correlated each other. Thus, we
cautioned that the six specific POPs that
were strongly associated with diabetes
may not be themselves causally related to
diabetes, but we thought it was likely that
either these six POPs or others highly cor-
related with them could be causally asso-
ciated with diabetes (1). Although it was
not stated in our previous study (1), it is
interesting to note that trans-nonachlor
was most strongly associated with diabe-

cluded in one model.
Synthesizing epidemiological find-
ings from our previous (1,13) and current
studies, we hypothesize that chlordane
may be the most important POP involved
in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by
influencing insulin resistance, although
there has been no experimental study on
the possible biological mechanism(s).
Chlordane, a mixture of 26 com-
pounds, was used as an agricultural pes-
ticide on home lawns and gardens and
against termites (14). Chlordane was
banned in the U.S. in the1980s; however,

breakdown products of chlordane still
persist in the tissue of fish, birds, and
mammals and are found in breast milk
(15). Chlordane is rapidly metabolized in
organisms into oxychlordane and
-chlordane or into impurities such as
trans-nonachlor or cis-nonachlor (14).
Most studies focusing on temporal trends
of POPs have identified a decreasing trend
since severe restriction on POPs from
1970s to 1990s, but since 1990 the re-
duction of POPs was gradual (15,16). In
addition, no reduction of chlordane was
observed in some studies (16,17), and
time trends of POPs are likely to vary for
different POPs in different areas (18). Pes-
ticides banned for over two decades in the
U.S., such as chlordane or dichloro-
diphenyl-trichloroethane, continue to be
present at significant levels in the food
supply (19).
In our previous study, subjects with
very low concentrations of POPs, includ-
ing those who were obese (1), surpris-
ingly experienced a low prevalence of
diabetes. This suggests that POPs con-
tained in the adipose tissue interact with
obesity in contributing to diabetes risk
(2,3). Some of our previous findings may
be criticized due to the cross-sectional de-
sign, but the lack of association between
obesity and diabetes among subjects with
very low concentrations of POPs is un-
likely to be a cross-sectional bias. In this
study, we observed a similar interaction
pattern between OC pesticides and ele-

*Adjusted for age, sex, race, poverty income ratio, BMI, waist circumference, cigarette smoking, serum cotinine, alcohol consumption, and exercise. Detectable
values of each POP were individually ranked, and the rank orders of the individual POPs in each subclass were summed to arrive at the subclass value. All not
detectable values were ranked as zero. The summary values were categorized by cutoff points of 25th, 50th, and 75th values of the sum of ranks.

vated HOMA-IR even among nondiabetic
subjects. The association between serum
concentration of OC pesticides and ele-
vated HOMA-IR tended to strengthen as
waist circumference increased, such that
there was no association among subjects
with low concentrations of OC pesticides,
while waist circumference was strongly
associated with HOMA-IR among sub-
jects with high concentrations of OC pes-
ticides. The consistency of the patterns is
thought provoking, even though the for-
mal tests for interaction were not signifi-
cant; the pattern leads to our hypothesis
that the toxicity of POPs related to the risk
of both insulin resistance and diabetes
may substantially increase as people get
fatter. Additionally, they suggest (but do
not prove) that obesity may not be a suf-
ficient cause of type 2 diabetes.
Among limitations, the cross-
sectional study design in the NHANES
does not allow inferences regarding the
temporality of events and the causality be-
tween POPs and insulin resistance. Sec-
ond, misclassification bias is possible for
subjects whose POPs would have been
detectable with a higher sample volume.
Such misclassification would be nondif-
ferential if sample volume is unrelated to
HOMA-IR. Third, HOMA-IR is a surro-
gate but is highly correlated with insulin
resistance measured using the euglyce-
mic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method
(20). Finally, inferences should be made
cautiously in light of the multiple com-
parisons made, even given the strong
agreement between the present findings
and those related to prevalent type 2 dia-
betes (1).
In summary, along with our previous
finding on the association between POPs
and diabetes, our current study raises par-
ticular suspicion that OC pesticides and
nondioxin-like PCBs may be involved in
the pathogenesis of insulin resistance,
which may explain part of the excess risk
for diabetes, associated with POPs more
generally. Especially, the interaction be-
tween OC pesticides and obesity on the
risk of insulin resistance and diabetes sug-
gests that POPs stored in adipose tissue
may play a role in the current epidemic of
type 2 diabetes.
