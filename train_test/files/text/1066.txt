Childhood Overweight and Parent- and
Teacher-Reported Behavior Problems
Evidence From a Prospective Study of Kindergartners
Ashlesha Datar, PhD; Roland Sturm, PhD
Objectives: To determine if there is a relationship be-
tween overweight and behavior problems among chil-
dren as young as 5 years old by studying the association
between overweight and behavioral health at entry into
kindergarten and to determine whether overweight sta-
tus is a risk factor for the onset of new behavior prob-
lems during the first 2 years in school.
Design: We use data from a nationally representative
sample of kindergartners in the United States--the Early
Childhood Longitudinal Study­Kindergarten class. Data
on height, weight, and parent- and teacher-reported be-
havior problems were collected 3 times during their first
2 years in school for 9949 children. We use a multivar-
iate regression analysis that controls for sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, parent-child interaction, birth
weight, and mother's mental health.
Results: Among girls, but not boys, there is a signifi-
cant association between overweight and teacher-
reported externalizing behavior problems (odds ratio
[OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-2.68),
teacher-reported internalizing behavior problems (OR,
1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.17), and parent-reported internal-
izing behavior problems (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.06)
at the beginning of kindergarten. However, overweight
status was not a risk factor for the onset of new behav-
ior problems over time for either girls (teacher-
reported externalizing behavior problems: OR, 0.58
[95% CI, 0.25-1.33]; teacher-reported internalizing
behavior problems: OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.88-2.03]; and
parent-reported internalizing behavior problems: OR,
1.29 [95% CI, 0.82-2.01]) or boys (teacher-reported
externalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.67-
1.57]; teacher-reported internalizing behavior prob-
lems: OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.68-1.52]; and parent-
reported internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.42 [95%
CI, 0.94-2.15]), whereas low family income and mater-
nal depression were strong predictors of such problems.
Conclusions: Childhood overweight is already associ-
ated with behavior problems when girls start school, but
not boys. In contrast to common belief, overweight sta-
tus does not predict the onset of new internalizing or ex-
ternalizing behavior problems during the first 2 years of
school.

PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS
have been hypothesized to
be among the most serious
consequences of childhood
overweight.1,2 Overweight
children and adolescents may be teased
and ridiculed or may experience social
marginalization, leading to low self-
esteem.3-7 Most data on the relationship
between overweight and mental health
have focused on adolescents or adults,
and, to our knowledge, no nationally
representative data have been published
for younger children. Erickson et al,8
using a sample from 13 schools in north-
ern California, report a significant cross-
sectional association between depressive
symptoms and body mass index among
third-grade girls, but not among third-
grade boys.
In this study, we use data from a na-
tional probability sample of kindergart-
ners in the United States to examine
whether overweight children are at a
higher risk for parent- and teacher-
reported internalizing and externalizing
behavior problems. This study helps us ex-
amine whether the association found by
Erickson et al8 in northern California
schools holds across the nation. Specifi-
cally, we examine the following: (1)
whether overweight status is associated
with greater behavior problems at the be-
ginning of kindergarten and (2) whether
overweight status at the beginning of kin-
dergarten is a significant predictor of be-
havior problems after 2 years in school
among children with no significant be-
havior problems when they entered kin-
dergarten.

METHODS
SAMPLE
We analyze data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study­
Kindergarten (ECLS-K) class. The ECLS-K surveyed a nation-
ally representative cohort of kindergartners from about 1000
kindergarten programs in the United States in the fall and spring
of the 1998-1999 school year. This sample will be followed up
through grade 5, with data collection on the full sample in the
spring of grades 1, 3, and 5. At this point, the first 2 years of
data are available. The ECLS-K sample was collected using a
dual-frame multistage sampling design with oversampling of
Asians and children with a disability. The National Center for
Educational Statistics9 has more information on the survey de-
sign and instruments.
We use data collected in the fall of kindergarten and the
spring of first grade in our analysis. The behavior problem vari-
ables came from the parent and teacher questionnaires. Typi-
cally, the respondent for parent interviews was the child's
mother. If the mother was not available, then the next selected
respondent was another parent or guardian, followed by an-
other household member. The response rates for the fall kin-
dergarten teacher and parent questionnaires were 91.4% and
85.3%, respectively. There were no significant differences in
the characteristics (race, sex, mother's educational level, and
family income) of children with and without teacher data, al-
though nonresponse on the parent questionnaire was more
prevalent among nonwhites. However, nonresponse on the
teacher and parent questionnaires was not associated with child's
overweight status. Follow-up data in the spring of first grade
on behavior problems were only available for 82.1% of these
children. Children with no follow-up data between kindergar-
ten and first grade were those who changed schools. The ECLS-K
followed up all movers from a random 50% of schools in the
sample. Therefore, most of the children with no follow-up data
were those randomly selected for no follow-up and would be
unlikely to bias the results. Our analysis sample consists of 9949
kindergartners with data on parent- and teacher-reported be-
havior problems in the fall of kindergarten and the spring of
first grade. Because our study uses public use data, it has been
exempted from institutional review board approval.
MEASURES
The key variables in this study are child overweight status and
teacher- and parent-reported behavior problems. The ECLS-K
includes 3 behavior problem scales based on the teacher- or
parent-reported Social Rating Scale (SRS), which we use to con-
struct our outcome measures. These scales were adapted from
the Social Skills Rating System instrument developed by Gre-
sham and Elliot.10 The Social Skills Rating System is a well-
established and useful tool for assessing and targeting social
skills deficits and competing problem behaviors.
Teacher-Reported Behavior Problems
The teacher SRS is a self-administered questionnaire and pro-
vides 2 scales--externalizing and internalizing behavior prob-
lems. The externalizing scale includes information on the act-
ing out behaviors of children and is based on 5 items that rate
the frequency with which a child argues, fights, gets angry, acts
impulsively, and disturbs ongoing activities. The internalizing
scale consists of 4 items that ask about the apparent presence
of anxiety, loneliness, low self-esteem, and sadness in the child.
Teachers used a response scale to report how often the child
demonstrated the behavior described: 1, never; 2, occasion-
ally or sometimes; 3, regularly, but not all the time; and 4, most
of the time. The scores on both scales are the mean rating on
the items included in the scale. The split half reliabilities for
the teacher SRS are high: 0.90 for externalizing problems and
0.80 for internalizing problems. We create dichotomous vari-
ables for externalizing and internalizing problems to simplify
the presentation. Children who scored at the 95th percentile
or higher on each scale were classified as having substantial be-
havior problems. The scales are not fully continuous and, there-
fore, slightly more than 5% of children will be identified as hav-
ing either substantial internalizing or substantial externalizing
problems. These scales do not provide clinical diagnoses, and
the choice of a cut point on a scale is always somewhat arbi-
trary. By using the 95th percentile on each scale, we can be con-
fident that children classified as having substantial problems
are sufficiently symptomatic to warrant at least a psychologi-
cal examination. To put these numbers into perspective, the
treated prevalence of mental health disorders based on pedi-
atric primary care diagnosis tends to be in the 5% range.11 The
exact cut points and their interpretation are not central to our
analysis because we only want to compare the relative preva-
lence in different populations, not provide an absolute esti-
mate of need. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used the 90th
and 97.5th percentile points as alternate cutoff points.
Parent-Reported Internalizing Behavior Problems
This scale is derived from the parent SRS and consists of 4 items
that ask parents about children's problems with being ac-
cepted and liked by others, sadness, loneliness, and low self-
esteem. Parents used the same 4-point response scale used in
the teacher SRS previously described. The reliability for the par-
ent SRS is lower than those for the teacher SRS (0.60). We di-
chotomize the scale similarly. Because of the way responses are
clustered on this scale, about 7% of the children display the
same or more symptoms as the child at the 95th percentile. Par-
ents were also asked about externalizing behavior problems in
their children. The reliability of this scale was rather low (0.47),
and we, therefore, did not include it in our analysis.
Overweight Status
We use the body mass index to classify children. Height and
weight were measured twice in the ECLS-K study at each pe-
riod. Children who had a body mass index, calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, at the
95th percentile or higher for their age and sex were classified
as overweight.12,13
Other Explanatory Variables
Additional explanatory variables included in the multivariate
regression models included race-ethnicity, annual family in-
come, whether the child belongs to a single-parent house-
hold, maternal depression, parent-child interaction, and child's
birth weight. These variables are discussed in detail in the "Data
Analysis" subsection of the "Methods" section.
DATA ANALYSIS
We first study the association between overweight status and
behavior problems cross-sectionally at the beginning of kin-
dergarten. We provide descriptive statistics and associations ad-
justed for potentially confounding factors that may be corre-
lated with childhood overweight and children's mental health.
For the multivariate analysis, we estimate a logit model
with behavior problem as the dependent variable and baseline
overweight status as the right-hand side predictor variable. The
first set of variables to control for confounding effects are stan-

dard sociodemographic variables: race-ethnicity (white, black,
Hispanic, Asian, and others), mother's educational level (high
school diploma, high school diploma, some college, bach-
elor's degree, and a bachelor's degree), annual family in-
come, whether the child belongs to a single-parent family, and
the number of siblings. The second set includes measures that
may be directly related to psychological functioning: parent-
child interaction, birth weight, and maternal depressive symp-
toms. The ECLS-K asked parents how often they participated
in 8 different activities with their child, such as reading books
to their children, telling stories, playing sports, and singing songs.
Our measure of parent-child interaction is defined as the num-
ber of activities that the parent participates in with the child at
least once a week. We include the child's birth weight because
there is evidence that low-birth-weight children may be at a
greater risk for psychological problems.14-16 In addition, paren-
tal depression has been shown to be a strong predictor of chil-
dren's psychological problems.17-21 The ECLS-K asked the par-
ent respondent 12 items from the Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale.22 The full Center for Epidemiologi-
cal Studies Depression Scale consists of 20 items, with scores
ranging between 0 and 60, on which scoring at 16 or higher is
considered to indicate elevated levels of depression. However,
because the ECLS-K survey did not consist of all 20 items, we
were unable to use the suggested cutoff. Instead, we use a con-
tinuous depression scale with scores from 0 to 36, with higher
scores indicating more depressive symptoms. We convert the
raw scores into standardized scores by dividing them by the
standard deviation (5.31) of these scores.
Our second analysis approach exploits the longitudinal na-
ture of the ECLS-K data to examine whether overweight sta-
tus at baseline is an important predictor of the onset of behav-
ior problems during the first 2 years in school. This prospective
design allows us to examine the direction of the relationship
between overweight and behavior problems. A logit regres-
sion model is estimated, in which the dependent variable is the
presence of behavior problems at the end of first grade. We used
the subset of children who were not described as having any
substantial behavior problems by the mother or teacher at base-
line. We estimate separate regression models for the 3 behav-
ior problem measures. We also estimate separate models for
boys and girls, using the same explanatory variables as in the
cross-sectional analysis.
Standard errors are corrected using the Huber-White cor-
rection to account for the correlation between children from
the same school.
RESULTS
The ECLS-K data show that about 1 in 10 kindergart-
ners (11.1%) was overweight when he or she entered kin-
dergarten in 1998; the percentage was slightly higher
among boys (11.7%) compared with girls (10.6%). De-
scriptively, the prevalence of teacher-reported substan-
tial externalizing behavior problems was more than twice
as high among boys (8.3%) compared with girls (3.5%).
The prevalence of substantial internalizing behavior prob-
lems did not differ significantly for boys vs girls (5.8%
vs 5.5% for teacher report [P=.48] and 7.0% vs 6.3% for
parent report [P=.17]).
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for boys and
girls separately, by overweight status. Overweight boys
were no more likely to have parent- or teacher-reported
behavior problems in the beginning of kindergarten com-
pared with boys who were not overweight. However, over-
weight girls were significantly more likely to have any
behavior problems at the beginning of kindergarten com-
pared with girls who were not overweight. These de-
scriptive statistics obviously include the effect of other

cates that overweight girls were less likely to be white
and more likely to have a family annual income of less
than $25000, mothers with a high school diploma or less,
fewer siblings, come from single-parent families, and a
higher birth weight compared with their peers who were
not overweight.
CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS AT BASELINE
Table 2 shows the odds ratio of behavior problems be-
tween overweight and non-overweight children, ad-
justed for sociodemographic characteristics, parent-
child interaction, birth weight, and maternal depression.
Overweight girls have about 81% greater odds of having
substantial teacher-reported externalizing behavior prob-
lems, 54% greater odds of having teacher-reported in-
ternalizing behavior problems, and 49% greater odds of
having parent-reported internalizing behavior prob-
lems compared with girls who are not overweight. In con-
trast to girls, Table 3 shows no significant differences
between overweight and non-overweight boys. In fact,

ent-child interaction, birth weight, and maternal depres-

slightly lower among overweight boys, but none of these
differences are close to significance.
RISK FACTORS FOR THE ONSET
OF BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS
For the longitudinal analysis, we restricted our sample
to only those children who did not exhibit substantial
behavior problems in the fall of kindergarten (81.9%
among boys and 86.3% among girls). The outcome vari-
able is whether a child displays substantial behavior
problems at the end of first grade. Results from adjusted
models are reported in Table 4 for girls and in
Table 5 for boys. There is no evidence that overweight
is a risk factor for developing behavior problems for
girls and boys. In contrast, low family income and
maternal depression are much stronger predictors of

the onset of behavior problems over time. For example,
the odds of developing externalizing behavior problems
during the first 2 years in school are more than 3 times
greater for girls in the lowest income quartile compared
with girls in the highest income quartile. Not surpris-
ingly, maternal depression had the strongest association
with parent-reported internalizing behavior problems,
but it may not be a reliable indicator of child health.
Maternal educational level was not a significant predic-
tor of the onset of behavior problems, with one excep-
tion. Boys with mothers who have a bachelor's degree
or more have about half the odds of developing teacher-
reported externalizing behavior problems compared
with boys with mothers who have a high school
diploma or less. We also tested whether there are inter-
actions of overweight status with race-ethnicity, but
found no significant effects. In addition, the results
from unadjusted models are similar to those from the
adjusted regression models.
In addition, boys and girls whose mothers scored 1
SD higher on the maternal depression scale were 15% and
14% more likely to exhibit teacher-reported internaliz-
ing behavior problems, respectively.
COMMENT
While there is much concern about a possible relation-
ship between overweight status and mental health prob-
lems, especially if the latter affects readiness to learn, there
are few data for younger children. The ECLS-K is the first
large and nationally representative data set to study chil-
dren in kindergarten and first grade. Beginning elemen-
tary schoolchildren are an important group because ad-
verse events could permanently lower educational
achievement. At the same time, elementary school is the
first time all children are exposed to possible interven-
tions or to screening for health risks that could precipi-
tate referrals to health care.
Our cross-sectional results confirm the findings of
one cross-sectional study8 of third-grade students in north-
ern California that associated overweight status with in-
creased depressive symptoms among girls, but not among
boys, after controlling for socioeconomic differences.
These findings suggest that overweight girls start school
with significant parent- and teacher-reported behavior
problems. In addition, the longitudinal aspect of the
ECLS-K data allowed us to identify risk factors for the
onset of behavior problems during the first 2 years of el-
ementary school among children who did not exhibit any
behavior problems at baseline. The longitudinal analy-
sis is important for understanding cause-effect relation-
ships between these 2 factors, and we are not aware of
any similar published data. In light of the literature em-
phasizing the adverse psychosocial effects of obesity, we
have focused on the temporal effects from overweight to
the onset of new (previously not reported) behavior prob-
lems. While family income and maternal depression were
strong predictors of the onset of behavior problems for
girls and boys, we found no evidence that overweight sta-
tus is a risk factor. These findings are similar to those in
one recent study23 among adolescents that found base-
line obesity was not a predictor of follow-up depres-
sion.
We also conducted sensitivity analyses by using
different cut points (90th and 97.5th percentiles) on
the behavior problem scales or by determining over-
weight status relative to a child's classmates rather
than using a national (age- and sex-specific) cut point.
However, none of the conclusions about the associa-
tions between overweight status and behavior prob-
lems are affected.
Our study findings should be interpreted in light of
several caveats. First, we focused on the onset of new sig-
nificant behavior problems, but there may also be dete-
rioration of emotional health among overweight chil-
dren who already had significant problems at baseline.
Second, including measures of parent-child interaction,
birth weight, and maternal depression in our multivar-
iate regression analyses may overcontrol for differences
between overweight and not overweight children if the
purpose is to identify children at risk of developing be-
havior problems. Finally, overweight status measured at
one point may not be a significant risk factor for subse-
quent behavior problems among children, but persis-
tent or long-term overweight may result in later mental
health problems, as suggested by one study.24 Future
waves of the ECLS-K data will provide opportunities to
test this hypothesis.
We also do not show results for the opposite causal
pathway, namely, that behavior problems predict later
weight gain. Recent data23,25,26 for adolescents suggest an
association between depression and later obesity, espe-
cially among women. The same pattern seems to hold in
these data. Among overweight girls, the presence of in-
ternalizing behavior problems predicted large addi-
tional body mass index gains, but no similar effects ex-
isted for boys. Further exploration of these preliminary
findings is recommended for future research.
There has been considerable attention on over-
weight status recently, often under the assumption that
this can cause psychosocial problems for children and
prevent learning. However, our results show that over-
weight girls already have more behavior problems be-
fore kindergarten; therefore, focusing on mental health
and overweight is important in the early years.
What This Study Adds
To our knowledge, there are no nationally representa-
tive data on the association between overweight and men-
tal health outcomes among young children despite grow-
ing concerns regarding increasing obesity and its likely
psychosocial effects.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to exam-
ine this relationship prospectively among a large sample
of kindergartners in the United States. We confirm that
there exists a significant association between over-
weight and behavioral health problems as early as start-
ing kindergarten. However, we find no evidence that over-
weight status at the beginning of kindergarten is a risk
factor for behavior problems after 2 years in school among
children with no behavior problems at baseline.
