Adeepening schism between conservatives and liberals since
the 1970s has implications for scientific research and policy
that alarm many scholars, policy makers, and members of the
public. Increasing ideological polarization and scientific
politicization affect political elites and ordinary citizens
(Abramowitz & Saunders, 2005; Gauchat, 2012; Layman,
Carsey, & Horowitz, 2006; Levendusky, 2009; Mann &
Ornstein, 2012; McCarty, Poole, & Rosenthal, 2006; Shapiro
& Bloch-Elkon, 2008; Treier & Hillygus, 2009).
Issues of particular concern include global warming and
climate change (Hindman, 2009; Ladwig, 2010; McCright &
Dunlap, 2011), stem cell research (Ho, Brossard, &
Scheufele, 2008), sexuality, sexual abstinence, AIDS
research (Burack, 2008; Hindman & Yan, 2012; Smith,
2001), health care (Hindman, 2012), and Darwinian evolu-
tion (Ladwig, 2010; Miller, Scott, & Okamoto, 2006;
Mooney, 2005). In fact, public trust in science itself has
waned among conservatives but not liberals or moderates in
the past four decades (Gauchat, 2012). Ideological divisions
also exist for other issues, such as the existence in Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction, numbers of casualties in the
Iraq war, Social Security, economic inequality, welfare
issues, and national economic conditions (Abramowitz &
Saunders, 2005; Bartels, 2002; Blake & Culley, 2011; Daves,
White, & Everett, 2011; Shapiro & Bloch-Elkon, 2008).
Some observers have thought that improving public
understanding of science would increase public acceptance
of scientific findings; however, this is not the case (e.g.,
Gauchat, 2012; Miller et al., 2006). Gauchat (2012) found
greater distrust of science in educated conservatives than in
less-educated conservatives and concluded,
Taken together, these results highlight a perplexing issue: cross-
nationally, more highly educated societies trust science more;
yet, within advanced societies the expansion of public education
over time has not brought about greater public trust. One
possible interpretation, supported by a growing number of
studies, is that social factors such as race/ethnicity, income,
religiosity, social capital, and political identifications are at
least as important as knowledge and education in predicting
trust in science (Gauchat, 2008, 2010; Sturgis & Allum, 2004;
Yearley, 2005). (pp. 169-170, italics added)
The objective of this article is to explore relationships of
variables relevant to ideology that may contribute to greater
understanding of these results, especially in light of recent
work on "belief gaps." Ideology is defined here as a philoso-
phy or body of ideas that forms the basis of a political, eco-
nomic, social, or other system, reflects its needs and interests,
and provides blueprints for action.1 Political conservatives

Components of the Belief Gap: Ideology
and Education
Cecilie Gaziano1
Abstract
Knowledge gap research focuses on education as an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES). Belief gap research centers
on ideology as potentially more powerful than education in comparing sociopolitical groups with scientifically established
knowledge and groups with opposing beliefs accepted on faith. This study examined the relationship between education
and ideology to understand belief gaps better. The study used 2008 American National Election Study (ANES) data to
compare conservatives, moderates, and liberals by education on religiosity, child rearing values, opinionation, need for
cognition, orientation toward politics, and mass media access and use. Although liberals tended to be more educated than
conservatives overall, better-educated conservatives had the highest household incomes and were a much larger group. No
known knowledge gap studies have reported results on one group characterized by high education and an opposing group
distinguished by a different indicator of SES. Reformulations of the belief gap hypothesis are offered.

respect for traditional institutions, distrust of government
activism, and opposition to sudden change in the established
order."2 In contrast, political liberalism supports reform,
openness to new ideas, tolerance, broad-mindedness, and
questioning of tradition.3 Political moderates occupy a mid-
dle ground between liberals and conservatives.
Belief Gaps Based on Ideology and
Knowledge Gaps Based on Education
Hindman (2009) introduced a "belief gap" hypothesis that
extended the "knowledge gap" hypothesis by offering beliefs
as the dependent variable instead of knowledge and by eval-
uating ideology and education as independent variables.
Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) proposed the knowl-
edge gap hypothesis as follows:
As the infusion of mass media information into a social system
increases, segments of the population with higher
socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a
faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in
knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather
than decrease. (pp. 159-160)
Although the knowledge gap hypothesis refers to socio-
economic status (SES), education frequently is used as the
indicator of SES in knowledge gap research, and knowledge
frequently is positively correlated with level of education
(Gaziano, 1997; Gaziano & Gaziano, 2009; Hwang & Jeong,
2009, 2010; Viswanath & Finnegan, 1996). SES indicators,
such as education, income, and occupation, tend to be inter-
correlated. Hindman (2009) theorized, however, that ideol-
ogy would be a better predictor than education of beliefs
about scientific evidence for global warming over time under
the conditions of increasing controversy, media coverage,
and activities of elites and interest groups on this issue. An
important contributory factor is an increasingly acrimonious
political environment. He emphasized that his review of the
knowledge gap hypothesis came
. . .within a broader social climate of rising political partisanship:
a time in which issues with public policy implications are
increasingly subject to political dispute and partisan polarization.
Of particular interest are heavily publicized issues in which the
scientific community plays a key role in defining the problem
and its causes. (Hindman, 2009, p. 790)
A growing gap over time between liberals and conserva-
tives was supported for beliefs about scientific evidence that
global warming is occurring, but it was not statistically sig-
nificant for beliefs that human activity causes global warm-
ing (Hindman, 2009).4 Education and ideology, however,
were related to beliefs in global warming as a consequence
of human activity. Liberals and the more educated were more
likely to perceive the actions of humans as causes of the
problem, compared with conservatives and the less educated.
Hindman (2009) expressed concern that conservatives
brushed aside scientifically supported data because of their
religious beliefs. He defined knowledge as empirically sup-
ported facts and beliefs as convictions accepted as true with-
out proof.
Other reports have relevant information. For example,
education played a role in belief that global warming is tak-
ing place, but it was not related to beliefs about the human
cause of the problem (McCright & Dunlap, 2011). McCright
and Dunlap did not differentiate knowledge from belief.
Their focus was beliefs about global warming that are con-
sistent with the scientific consensus and beliefs that are not.
They noted several studies reporting negative correlations
between education and concern about global warming and
one study that found a positive relationship between educa-
tion and concern. They stated, in particular, ". . . the effects
of educational attainment and self-reported understanding on
beliefs about climate science and personal concern about
global warming are positive for liberals and Democrats, but
are weaker or negative for conservatives and Republicans"
(McCright & Dunlap, 2011, p. 175, italics in original).
Controlling for other major variables did not change the find-
ings. Liberals tended to champion the view that scientific
consensus shows global warming to be a real issue, stem-
ming from human activity, and a threat to society.
Conservatives tended to challenge the scientific consensus
and defend the industrial capitalist system.
The proportions of the American public who believed that
global warming was a real phenomenon grew between 2001
and 2010, but declined sharply in 2010 (McCright & Dunlap,
2011). The proportion of people who believed that human
activities were responsible for global warming decreased
somewhat. The Pew Research Center for the People & the
Press (2011) reported similar findings. The proportions who
were very concerned about the implications of global warm-
ing tended to increase, with some fluctuations. Overall,
McCright and Dunlap (2011) found evidence of ideological
and political partisan polarization.
The results of Hindman (2009) and McCright and Dunlap
(2011) indicate that a more detailed look at the relation
between education and ideology may increase our under-
standing of any potential tension between them. The first
hypothesis, therefore, is,
Hypothesis 1: Higher education will be positively related
to greater liberalism, and conversely, lower education will
be related to greater conservatism.
Research Question 1 (RQ1): Are there other demo-
graphic differences that distinguish conservatives from
liberals?
Religious Value Predispositions
Religiosity is frequently identified as a value predisposition
that can be antithetical to science (Brossard, Scheufele, Kim,
Gaziano 3
& Lewenstein, 2009; Gauchat, 2008, 2010, 2012; Ho et al.,
2008; Ladwig, 2010; Sturgis & Allum, 2004; Yearley, 2005).
Religiosity influences people, in part, through childhood
socialization, interpersonal networks, and information sources.
Ho et al. (2008) examined the public's attitudes toward
another controversial scientific issue, stem cell research.
They concluded that the public makes sense of this issue by
using value predispositions and heuristic cues received from
news media. The public's beliefs about stem cell research
were conditioned by three value predispositions in particu-
lar: religiosity, ideology, and deference to scientific author-
ity. Education was positively related to support for human
embryonic stem cell research, although the relationship
attenuated after other variables were controlled. While this
study was not highly similar to Hindman's (2009), the ten-
dency of many in the public to rely on non-scientific means
to shape their views is of interest.
Religious beliefs played an indirect role in public support
for funding nanotechnology, in addition to influences such as
science media and knowledge (Brossard et al., 2009).
Religious value predispositions tempered factual knowledge
about nanotechnology.
Ladwig (2010) compared ideology and religiosity as
value predispositions that predict (a) controversial science
knowledge (about human evolution and the big bang theory
of the origin of the universe) and (b) non-controversial
science (the very hot center of the earth, radioactivity,5 lasers,
electrons, antibiotics,6 and continental drift), measured at
one point in time.Although he did not directly test Hindman's
hypotheses, his results suggest support. Liberals with high
non-controversial knowledge scores also scored highly on
controversial knowledge. This occurred for conservatives,
too, but to a lesser degree. Liberals also scored higher than
conservatives on self-perceived knowledge of scientific
study. The value predispositions of religiosity and ideology
were significant and explained almost 12% of the variance in
the model. (Greater scores on a socioeconomic index that
accounted for education, income, and occupation were sig-
nificantly related to non-controversial science knowledge,
even when all other major variables were accounted for.)
The next hypothesis proposed, therefore, is,
Hypothesis 2: Religiosity will be positively related to
conservatism.
Child Rearing Value Predispositions
People may be predisposed to understand ideology and appro-
priate government­citizen relations in terms of the earliest
examples to which they are exposed--the parent­child rela-
tionship (Barker & Tinnick, 2006; Lakoff, 2002). Some see
the social construction of ideology based on perceptions of
parent­child relations as either nurturance (related to liberal-
ism) or discipline (related to conservatism). Those who lean
toward the nurturant model are more likely to stress egalitarian
and compassionate values; those inclined toward the discipli-
narian model tend to emphasize political individualism and
traditionalism (Barker & Tinnick, 2006; Lakoff, 2002).
Lakoff's (2002) nurturant model emphasizes parent­child
discussion with explanations for rules and with give and
take, even to the extent of allowing conflict and disagree-
ment. Parental supervision of children relies on persuasion
rather than punishment. The goals are empathy, social
responsibility, and cooperation (Barker & Tinnick, 2006).
Lakoff's "strict father," or disciplinarian, model seeks to pro-
tect children from a dangerous and difficult world by empha-
sizingstrictadherencetoauthority,punishmentforinfractions
of rules, and competition with the goals of personal respon-
sibility, self-discipline, and strong morals. Of course, many
families fall in between these polar opposites. (For earlier
work on these concepts, see Baumrind, 1968, 1971; Gaziano,
2001; Maccoby & Martin, 1983.)
Barker and Tinnick (2006; also see Feldman & Stenner,
1997) used data from the 2000 American National Election
Study (ANES) to test Lakoff's theory, using an index of
items concerning the qualities that children should have.
Child rearing values scores related to the two models of nur-
turance and discipline strongly predicted attitudes toward a
variety of issues, including conservatism or liberalism, as
hypothesized.
Social structure influences people's child rearing behav-
iors through the mechanisms of occupation and parents'child
rearing values. Kohn's (1969/1989, 1976) and others'research
(Kohn, Slomczynski, & Schoenbach, 1986; Weininger &
Lareau, 2009) showed that middle-class parents tend to stress
self-direction as a value and that working class parents tend to
emphasize conformity to external standards and to exhibit
more authoritarianism. "Middle class" in the United States is
"the socioeconomic class between the working class and the
upper class, usually including professionals, highly skilled
laborers, and lower and middle management."7 The "working
class" in the United States is "the socioeconomic class con-
sisting of people who work for wages, especially low wages,
including unskilled and semiskilled laborers and their
families."8
Middle-class occupations tend to be concerned with the
manipulation of interpersonal relations, ideas, and symbols;
working-class occupations tend to be oriented toward things.
Middle-class occupations often entail more self-direction,
less close supervision, and less conformity to rules and
authority than working-class occupations do. Level of educa-
tion underlies these differences as a key variable in entry into
occupations, having direct and indirect impact on people.9
Hypothesis 3a: Conservative ideology will be positively
related to more disciplinarian, or authoritarian, child rear-
ing values, and liberal ideology will be negatively related
to authoritarian child rearing values.
Hypothesis 3b: Education will be negatively related to
more authoritarian child rearing values.

Opinionation
Another moderating influence may be having strong opin-
ions. Having stronger opinions about political issues is asso-
ciated with being more knowledgeable about politics and
public affairs, greater participation, and greater news media
use (Garramone, 1983; Kim, Scheufele, & Shanahan, 2005;
Milbrath & Goel, 1982; Scheufele, Shanahan, & Kim, 2002;
Stamm, Emig, & Hesse, 1997; Zaller, 1992). It may be that
conservatives and liberals are more attuned to political issues
and feel more passionately about them; thus, the next hypoth-
esis is,
Hypothesis 4: Conservatives and liberals will be equally
opinionated.
Research Question 2 (RQ2): Will education moderate
the relationship of ideology and opinionation?
Need for Cognition
One moderating variable may be differences in the way peo-
ple think, not only cognitive skills but also other cognitive
styles, which can vary by education and ideology. Higher
education and advantages provided by higher SES allow
greater development of cognitive skills (Eveland &
Scheufele, 2000; Gaziano, 2012; Hackman & Farah, 2009;
Neuman, 2006; Park & Kosicki, 1995; Tichenor et al., 1970),
as well as perceptions of a greater need for cognition (Liu &
Eveland, 2005).
Need for cognition is a person's tendency to engage in and
enjoy thinking, including whether one prefers complex prob-
lem solving or simplicity of tasks (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982).
Cacioppo and Petty (1982) investigated a potential relation-
ship between dogmatism and need for cognition because
Rokeach (1960) had found that highly dogmatic persons val-
ued social recognition, salvation, and obedience, whereas
those lower in dogmatism placed greater value on equality,
freedom, and being broad-minded. Dogmatism (rigid asser-
tion of opinions, ideas, whether empirically supported or
not) is a construct related to authoritarianism (obedience to
authority, maintaining control of a parent/governing body
over others). Because greater open-mindedness overlaps
somewhat with need for cognition, they expected to find
dogmatism and need for cognition weakly and negatively
correlated, which they did. In addition, higher American
College Test scores in their college student sample were
related to lower dogmatism.
Furthermore, research on the brain has uncovered differ-
ences between conservatives and liberals (Amodio, Jost,
Master, & Yee, 2007). Results were considered to be consis-
tent with previous research showing liberals to be more
adaptable to information complexity, ambiguity, and novelty,
while conservatives were more responsive to more struc-
tured, orderly, and predictable situations. A meta-analysis of
data from 12 countries showed how three categories of
social-cognitive motives act on political conservatism (Jost,
Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003). The following
hypotheses are offered:
Hypothesis 5a: Conservatives and liberals will differ in
their needs for cognition.
Hypothesis 5b: Education will be positively related to
greater need for cognition.
Orientation Toward Politics
If liberals and conservatives are expected to be more opin-
ionated than moderates, this could include higher levels of
interpersonal discussion about political issues, greater politi-
cal interest, and more political activities. Others have shown
the importance of these behaviors and their interrelatedness
in the political process (e.g., Eveland & Scheufele, 2000;
Gaziano, 1997, Liu & Eveland, 2005; Peterson, Duncan, &
Pang, 2002; Scheufele, 2000; Scheufele, Nisbet, Brossard, &
Nisbet, 2004; Viswanath & Finnegan, 1996). Research ques-
tions on these points are as follows:
Research Question 3a (RQ3a): Will conservatives and lib-
erals discuss the presidential election equally frequently?
Research Question 3b (RQ3b): Will education make a
difference in their discussion behavior?
Research Question 4a (RQ4a): Will liberals and conser-
vatives be equally interested in the campaign?
Research Question 4b (RQ4b): Will education play a
role in political interest?
Research Question 5a (RQ5a): Will conservatives and
liberals be equally politically active?
Research Question 5b (RQ5b): Will education make a
difference in their political activities?
Mass Media Access and Use
Access to information circulating in the environment is an
important variable in belief (Hindman, 2009) and knowledge
gaps (Gaziano, 2010; Jerit, Barabas, & Bolsen, 2006;Tichenor
et al., 1970; Viswanath & Finnegan, 1996). Although the
present study does not focus on knowledge gaps per se, a rea-
sonable assumption is that liberals and conservatives who are
opinionated and cognitively sophisticated are likely to have
access to the largest information environments and to attend
to media content more closely.
The more educated may have larger print environments
and the less educated may have larger broadcast media envi-
ronments because increased print media coverage of political
issues tends to strengthen the relation between education and
knowledge but increased television coverage does not tend
to improve the relationship. It may be that print is more cog-
nitively demanding and broadcast is more accessible to the
less educated but also more superficial in coverage (Gandy
& El Waylly, 1985; Kleinnijenhuis, 1991).
Gaziano 5
The dataset used in the present study does not include
measures of use of specific news channels such as CNN,
NBC, CBS, or Fox, or online blogs. Other research, how-
ever, has shown that conservatives and Republicans are
likely to perceive content on conservative talk shows and
television channels as more truthful and sources and con-
tent favoring Democrats and liberals as untruthful (Jamieson
& Cappella, 2009). Conservatives have tended to view
mainstream news media with distrust and to prefer outlets
that share their views; however, their knowledge and beliefs
about certain issues such as the number of American casu-
alties in the War in Iraq, the Occupy Wall Street movement,
or abstinence-only sex education have tended to be inac-
curate when conservative news outlets such as Fox are their
main news sources (Jamieson & Cappella, 2009; Johansen
& Joslyn, 2008; Hindman & Yan, 2012; Morris, 2005;
Young & Brewer, 2012). Similarly, Democrats and liberals
tended to find CNN and NPR as more honest. Partisan
weblogs may have magnified these kinds of effects on
polarization (Baum & Groeling, 2008; Eveland & Dylko,
2007; Johnson & Kaye, 2004). CNN, MSNBC, and other
sources potentially seen as more liberal have not seemed to
be as partisan.
Fragmented or more insular information environments
can contribute to lower understanding of political views con-
trary to one's own and to lower tolerance for conflicting
viewpoints (Baum & Groeling, 2008; Iyengar & Hahn, 2009;
Shapiro & Bloch-Elkon, 2008; Tewkesbury, 2005). Increased
exposure to "likeminded" partisan news appears to lead to
decreased tolerance of a diversity of views, decreased under-
standing of other groups, and decreased accuracy of issue
knowledge, especially among more partisan groups who may
be among the easiest to mobilize to support political candi-
dates for office (Dilliplane, 2011). Gauchat (2012, p. 171)
stated,
Studies of the conservative movement in the United States
have also focused on its cultural dimensions and, particularly,
the [New Right's] media empire. Beginning with radio and
book publishing houses and then extending into cable
television, think tanks, and Internet social networking sites,
the NR has created an intellectual apparatus that promotes the
conservative agenda and articulates a conservative cultural
identity. This intellectual base represents an alternative to
academic locations and the scientific community and is often
socially distinguished and reinforced through its criticism of
"liberal" bias in these cultural spheres (Blee & Creasap, 2010;
Gross et al., 2011; Nash, [2006]). For example, Jacques,
Dunlap, and Freeman (2008) have identified an elite-driven
movement that is culturally located in conservative think tanks
and media outlets and often disputes scientific conclusions to
advance ideological or financial goals. (see also Oreskes and
Conway, 2010)
The following research questions and hypothesis derive
from these findings:
Research Question 6a (RQ6a): Will conservatives and
liberals have equivalent use and attention to major mass
media about the presidential election?
Research Question 6b (RQ6b): Will education make a
difference in the media behavior of liberals and
conservatives?
Hypothesis 6: Conservatives will be more distrustful of
mainstream media than liberals.
Political Party Identification
While some argue that political partisanship is the concept
that people can identify with more easily than ideology
(Levendusky, 2009), ideology is the focus here because ide-
ology and anti-science political stances are frequently identi-
fied as important public policy issues (e.g., Gauchat, 2012;
Hindman, 2009; McCright & Dunlap, 2011). Ideology and
partisanship appear to be increasingly correlated over time,
however (Abramowitz & Saunders, 2005; McCright &
Dunlap, 2011; Shapiro & Bloch-Elkon, 2008; Veenstra,
Hossain, & Lyons, in press).
Method
Data are from the 2008 ANES, which conducted face-to-face
interviews.10 Pre-election interviews (n = 2,322) averaged
73 min and were carried out September 2 through November
3, 2008. Post-election interviews (n = 2,102) averaged
91 min and were conducted November 5 through December 30,
2008. The pre-election maximum response rate11 was 78.2%,
and the post-election maximum response rate was 57.7%.12
The data were weighted to adjust for age, education, non-
response, and attrition. The survey used randomization by a
computer-assisted interviewing procedure, used for selection
of half-samples to reduce overall interview length, and for
question order within batteries. The number of cases for the
present analyses was less than the total because respondents
who did not think of themselves in ideological terms were
omitted from the analysis.
Demographics.Besides education, demographics frequently
identified as characteristics important to citizenship and
understanding of political and scientific issues are age (being
older), family income (higher), and gender (male; Bennett,
1989; Brossard et al., 2009; Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1996;
Eveland & Scheufele, 2000; Ho et al., 2008; Kwak, 1999;
McCright & Dunlap, 2011). Furthermore, Caucasians have
had more advantages, knowledge, and access to relevant
information sources (Gaziano & Horowitz, 2001; Williams
& Collins, 1995). Respondents were asked the grade of
school or year of college they had completed (recorded as
categories); the month, day, and year of their birth; race; and
household income (recorded as categories). Interviewers
observed gender.
6 SAGE Open
Ideology.Ideology was measured on a 7-point scale on
which the political views that people might hold were
arranged from extremely liberal (=1) to extremely conserva-
tive (=7). Respondents were asked, "Where would you place
yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought much about
this? (Political party identification was measured on a
7-point scale, ranging from strong Democrat [= 0] to strong
Republican [= 6].)
Religious value predispositions.
Respondents were asked
whether they considered religion to be an important part of
their lives, how much guidance it gave them, how often they
prayed, and how often they attended religious services. In
addition, people were asked whether they thought the Bible
is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, whether
it is the word of God but not everything in it should be taken
literally, or whether the Bible is a book written by men and is
not the word of God. If they were Christian, they were asked,
"Would you call yourself a born-again Christian, that is, have
you personally had a conversion experience related to Jesus
Christ?" In addition, a religiosity score was constructed by
summing responses to amount of guidance, frequency of
praying, and frequency of attending religious services (Cron-
bach's  = .83).
In the United States, the principal religions represented
are Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, although Christians
considerably outnumber Jews. Respondents who attended
other types of religious services or thought of themselves as
part of some other religious denomination were just a frac-
tion of the total. For instance, less than 2% attended non-
Judeo-Christianservices,andabout6%thoughtofthemselves
as Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or other non-Judeo-Christian
religion, regardless of attendance at services.
Child rearing value predispositions.A 4-point scale of child
rearing values was constructed, ranging from low to high
authoritarianism, following Feldman and Stenner (1997).
Respondents were asked to choose between four word pairs
describing desirable qualities for children to have. Each pair
contained one "authoritarian" word and one "non-authori-
tarian" (self-direction) word. Authoritarian responses were
scored 1, non-authoritarian responses were scored 0, and
responses that neither or both were important (or not cer-
tain) were scored 0.5. The child rearing values score summed
up responses for each of the four questions, ranging from
0 to 4. (Barker & Tinnick, 2006), used only three of these
word pairs.) The wording was, "Although there are a num-
ber of qualities that people feel that children should have,
every person thinks that some are more important than oth-
ers. I am going to read you pairs of desirable qualities. For
each pair please tell me which one you think is more impor-
tant for a child to have: [`Both' should be volunteered.] 1.
Independence or respect for elders, 2. Obedience or self-
reliance, 3. Curiosity or good manners, and 4. Being consid-
erate or well behaved." [The authoritarian response is
italicized.] Cronbach's  = .60. This compares with .49
(Kuder-Richardson) for Barker and Tinnick (2006) and .66
(Cronbach) for Feldman and Stenner (1997).
Opinionation.
Three questions measured opinionation:
(a) "Would you say you have opinions about almost every-
thing, about many things, about some things, or about very
few things? (rescaled from low to high); (b) "If you wanted
to defend an opinion of yours, how successfully do you think
you could do that?" using a 5-point scale, rescaled from low
to high; and, (c) "Of the situations when you see two people
disagreeing with one another, in how many of them can you
see how both people could be right?" using a 5-point scale,
from low to high.
Need for cognition. Participants were asked, "Do you like hav-
ing responsibility for handling situations that require a lot of
thinking, do you dislike it, or do you neither like it nor dislike
it?" (after follow-up questions: 5-point scale dislike it a lot =

Orientation toward politics. Respondents were asked the num-
ber of days in a week they discussed politics with their fam-
ily or friends, and they were asked how interested they were
in politics and government on a 5-point scale, rescaled from
low to high.13 An 8-point political participation scale (0-7)
was created by summing the number of positive answers to
questions about actions such as trying to persuade others to
vote for a particular party or candidate; attending any gather-
ings in support of a candidate; displaying a campaign button,
a car bumper campaign sticker, or a sign on their property,
working for parties or candidates; and giving money to polit-
ical groups.
Mass media access and use. Participants were asked whether
they watched any programs about the presidential campaign
on television, read about it in any magazines or any newspa-
pers, heard any speeches or discussions about it on the radio,
or accessed information about it on the Internet. If they had,
they also were asked about frequency of use and amount of
attention paid to content.14 Because exposure and attention
were highly correlated, ranging from .75 to .93 and some
researchers recommend combining them (e.g., Cacciatore,
Scheufele, & Corley, 2012; Eveland & Scheufele, 2000), fre-
quency and level of attention were standardized and com-
bined into one variable for each medium. Intercorrelations
ranged from .09 (Internet and newspapers) to .39 (magazines
and newspapers), with most in the .2 range. In addition,
respondents were asked, "How much of the time do you
think you can trust the media to report the news fairly?--Just
about always, most of the time, only some of the time, or
almost never?" (recoded from low to high).

Analysis
First, respondents were divided into high (some college or
more education) and low (high school degree or less) educa-
tion groups, and they were also divided into conservatives,
moderates, and liberals. These groups were cross-tabulated
to form six groups. Key variables were examined according
to these groups. Then, a hierarchical ordinary least squares
regression was conducted with the dependent variable, ideol-
ogy, regressed on the independent variables, entered in
blocks to determine the best predictors. The demographic
variables were entered first, then religiosity, child rearing
values, and opinion and cognitive variables, followed by
political discussion, political interest, political participation,
and media use variables, in a likely causal order. Four
interaction variables followed, for education by each of the
following: (a) religiosity, (b) child rearing values, (c) opin-
ionation, and (d) need for cognition. These variables were
first centered before being multiplied to create interaction
terms to reduce potential multicollinearity between the terms
and their components. (Similarly, these variables were
regressed on political party identification separately, because
partisanship and ideology were expected to be highly
correlated.)
Results
Support for the hypotheses will be examined for each con-
ceptual group of variables and then re-examined in light of
the regression on ideology.
Education and ideology.Roughly one fourth of the citizens
interviewed were liberals, more than one fourth were moder-
ates, and fewer than one half were conservatives (Table 1).
The first hypothesis predicted that higher education would
be positively related to greater liberalism and conversely,
lower education would be related to greater conservatism.
About three fourths of liberals had been to college, com-
pared with somewhat more than half of moderates and two
thirds of conservatives. Hypothesis 1, which expected educa-
tion and ideology to be inversely related, was weakly sup-
ported; however, the pattern was somewhat unexpected
because more conservatives and liberals than moderates had
been to college. One of the most notable results, however,
was that better-educated conservatives constituted the largest
of the 6 groups, nearly 3 in 10 respondents, compared with
about 2 in 10 who were better-educated liberals. There also
were more than twice as many less-educated conservatives
as less-educated liberals. Further results for education will be
examined later.
RQ1 asked whether there were other demographic differ-
ences between conservatives and liberals. Table 1 indicates
many differences. As a group, better-educated liberals and
moderates were younger (see Table 2 for results on age) and
more likely to be single or to be female than other groups
(Table 1). Less-educated conservatives were disproportion-
ately more likely to be male. Most notably, although liberals
had an advantage over others in education, better-educated
conservatives were the wealthiest group. Less-educated lib-
erals were very different from more-educated liberals in
race, incomes, work status, and disability status. More-
educated conservatives were disproportionately more likely
to be White and to be married. Well-educated liberals were
especially likely to be working. More students were found
among well-educated moderates. Better-educated liberals
were much more willing than other groups to identify them-
selves as homosexual or bisexual. Less-educated moderates
and conservatives were more likely than others to have
served or to be serving in the military, and more-educated
liberals were the least likely to have military service. As
would be expected, liberals tended to be Democrats, regard-
less of educational level. Conservatives tended to be
Republicans, particularly more-educated conservatives.
Moderates were inclined to be Independents, as would be
expected; very few of them were Republicans.
Religious value predispositions.The second hypothesis stated
that religiosity would be positively related to conservatism.
More than 8 in 10 conservatives said that religion was an
important part of their lives, regardless of education (Table 3).
Fewer than 6 in 10 well-educated liberals said this. Other
groups fell in between. Less-educated liberals and all conser-
vatives tended to agree that religion provided a great deal of
guidance in day-to-day living. Better-educated liberals
tended to say that it gave them "some guidance" than to say
"a great deal of guidance." Better-educated conservatives
were well above the average in reporting attendance at reli-
gious services, and all conservatives were above average in
how often they prayed (Table 2). Although more of the well-
educated liberals said that they attended services than said
they did not, those saying they did not ever attend services
were the largest proportion of all the groups who said this.
Overall religiosity was the highest in conservatives, espe-
cially those who were highly educated. It was the lowest
among highly educated liberals but not as low in less-edu-
cated liberals. Roughly half of all the more-educated groups
agreed that the Bible is God's word but not all of it should be
interpreted literally (Table 3). Nearly 4 in 10 liberals per-
ceived it as a book written by people only, considerably more
than other groups. Six in 10 less-educated conservatives and
nearly 5 in 10 less-educated moderates believed that the
Bible is literally the word of God. Approximately two thirds
of all conservatives reported born-again experiences as
Christians, compared with one third of well-educated liber-
als. In general, Hypothesis 2 was supported.
Child rearing value predispositions.Hypothesis 3a stated that
conservatives would have more authoritarian child rearing
values than liberals. Hypothesis 3b proposed that higher edu-
cation would be related to less authoritarian child rearing

values. More-educated liberals scored lower on this measure
than others, while less-educated liberals scored above the
mean, giving only partial support to Hypothesis 3a (Table 2).
Although conservatives tended to give an authoritarian
response, less-educated conservatives scored higher on this
than more-educated conservatives did. Hypothesis 3b was
supported only for better-educated liberals; better-educated
moderates and conservatives tended to be average in authori-
tarian child rearing values.
Opinionation. Hypothesis 4 stated that conservatives and lib-
erals would be equally opinionated. The more-educated lib-
erals and conservatives tended to say that they had more
opinions than others, which lends some support to the
hypothesis (Table 2). Less-educated liberals were nearly as
likely to report being opinionated as more-educated liberals.
Results, therefore, did not provide a clear answer to RQ2
about the role of education in moderating the relation of ide-
ology and opinionation. Responses to two other questions
about opinions were examined. Respondents were asked
how successfully they thought they could defend their opin-
ions. Better-educated liberals felt the most confident of
standing up for their opinions, and less-educated moderates
and conservatives showed the least confidence. The partici-
pants were also asked, of situations when they see two peo-
ple disagreeing with each other, in how many they could see
that both could be right. More-educated moderates and liber-
als were the most able to do this, and less-educated conserva-
tives tended to be the least able to perceive this.
Need for cognition.Hypothesis 5a expected that conserva-
tives and liberals would differ in need for cognition but
received mixed support in this initial look at results. Hypoth-
esis 5b stated that education would moderate this relation-
ship but did not receive clear-cut support. Well-educated
conservatives and liberals tended to prefer responsibility for
handling a lot of thinking, closely followed by well-educated
moderates (Table 2). Nearly two thirds of well-educated lib-
erals favored complex problems over simple ones, compared
with about half of better-educated conservatives (data not
shown). Well-educated moderates fell in between. All the
less-educated groups chose simple problems over complex
ones.
Orientation toward politics.RQ3a asked whether conserva-
tives and liberals would discuss the presidential election
equally frequently. RQ4a enquired about ideology and inter-
est in politics and public affairs. RQ5a concerned whether
liberals and conservatives were equally politically active.
RQ3b, RQ4b, and RQ5b asked whether education would
make a difference in these political orientation variables.
Conservatives did not talk about the election with others or

participate as often as liberals did, and education did not
diminish these differences very much (Table 2). Highly edu-
cated liberals and conservatives had the highest interest
levels.
Mass media access and use. RQ6a asked whether conserva-
tives and liberals would have equivalent access, use, and
attention to major mass media about the presidential elec-
tion, and RQ6b asked whether education would influence
their media behaviors. Access to television did not differ
among them (Table 4). Radio speeches and discussions about
the campaign and newspapers reached better-educated liber-
als and conservatives in fairly similar numbers. Among the
less-educated groups, conservatives accessed radio the most
often. Education did not affect newspaper access very much,
although well-educated political moderates stood out as
newspaper readers; however, more-educated liberals had
considerably greater access to magazines and the Internet
than more-educated conservatives and moderates.
Hypothesis 6 expected conservatives to be more skeptical
of mainstream media. It was supported particularly by results
for the more-educated conservatives (Table 2). Less-educated
conservatives were also mistrustful but not as strongly.
Liberals found the media the most credible, especially those
with less education.
Regression on ideology. Demographics, religiosity, authoritar-
ian child rearing values, opinionation, need for cognition,
orientation toward politics, and mass media variables were
entered in blocks and regressed on ideology to examine these
relationships more fully when controls were added (Table 5).
Political party identification was not entered because of
the high relationship between ideology and party (r = .61,
p  .001). For comparison, however, a separate regression on
partisanship with the same independent variables was
performed.
The first hypothesis expected that higher education would
be positively related to greater liberalism, and conversely,
lower education would be related to greater conservatism.
The hypothesis was supported even when other variables
were controlled. Interestingly, the relation of household
income, another indicator of SES, was opposite of the results
for education. RQ1 asked whether demographics besides
education were of importance, as mentioned earlier. Lower
education, higher household incomes, being male, and being
White were of the greatest importance because they remained
significant in the final model, while age was no longer sig-
nificant. The demographic variables explained 6.9% of the
variance in ideology.
Hypothesis 2 expected religiosity and conservatism to be
positively related, and Hypothesis 3 expected authoritarian
child rearing values to be positively related to conservatism.
Both of these were supported when controls were added.
Three variables relevant to opinions were included. They
were not highly interrelated, indicating that they measured
different things. These were being opinionated, believing
one could successfully defend one's opinions, and being able
to see two disagreeing parties as potentially being right at

times. Although all three were correlated initially with ideol-
ogy, only the third played a significant role. The sign was
negative, meaning that inability to see two sides to an argu-
ment being right sometimes was related to greater conserva-
tism. Results relevant to Hypothesis 4 showed that
opinionation did not characterize one ideological group more
than another. Need for cognition was not a significant predic-
tor, pertinent to Hypothesis 5a, suggesting that this variable
did not set conservatives and liberals apart from each other.
Value predisposition, opinion, and cognitive variables
explained 11.3% of the variance in ideology.
RQ3a, RQ4a, and RQ5a concerned ideology and orienta-
tion to politics (discussion, interest, and participation, respec-
tively), and RQ3b, RQ4b, and RQ5b asked about the role of
education in these relations. They were not significant and
scarcely explained any variance.
RQ6a asked whether conservatives and liberals would
have equivalent mass media use and attention concerning
the presidential election. The negative sign for the zero-
order relation of these variables suggested that lower fre-
quency of use and attention to mass media were predictors
of conservatism, but none of these relationships was sig-
nificant when controls were added. Hypothesis 6 indicated
that conservatives would be more distrustful of mainstream
media than liberals, and distrust of media to report news
fairly was significant. Media variables explained 4.4% of
the variance, nearly all of which came from lack of media
trust.
Interactions with education were examined with respect
to four variables: religious value predispositions, authoritar-
ian child rearing value dispositions, opinionation, and need
for cognition. The first three were positive and significant;
need for cognition was negative and significant. They
explained 1% of the variance. These interactions further
address support for Hypothesis 3b (concerning authoritarian
child rearing values and education), RQ2 (concerning the
moderating role of education on opinion), and Hypothesis 5b
(about education and need for cognition). Higher education
was related to lower conservatism when levels of religiosity,
authoritarian values, and opinionation were lower; however,
when conservatism was higher, the more educated also
tended to be higher in religiosity, authoritarian child rearing
values, and opinionation. Second, higher education was
related to lower conservatism when participants had higher
need for cognition; conversely, higher education correlated
with higher conservatism when need for cognition was lower.
The overall regression model explained almost 25% of
the variance in ideology (23.4% adjusted R2).
Because ideology and partisanship were highly corre-
lated, a separate regression on political partisanship (high
scores = Republican) was conducted. It produced a some-
what similar pattern of results (not shown). Education was
not very important when demographics were controlled nor
was being able to see two sides of an argument. Greater polit-
ical participation and lower magazine use and attention were
predictors. The patterns of interactions were similar, but only

Limitations
The study was based on secondary data and therefore was
limited to the questions available, and questions measuring

sources such as CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, and so on were not
included. It used cross-sectional data and was not able to use
the panel design. More needs to be known about changes in
ideological differentials over time. It may be that belief gaps
due to ideology open and close fluidly over time as some
research indicates that knowledge gaps do (Viswanath,
Finnegan, Hannan, & Luepker, 1991), or as Hindman (2009)
hypothesizes, may widen over time. The purpose of the
study, however, was to examine the relation between educa-
tion and ideology, and the results contribute insights into

ways in which liberals and conservatives differ, especially
with regard to education and income. A number of available
questions concerned key concepts examined in the present
study: religious value predispositions, child rearing value
predispositions, opinionation, need for cognition, orientation
toward politics, and media access and use.
Discussion and Conclusion
This study sought to examine the relationship between edu-
cation and ideology to better understand belief gaps between
conservatives and liberals. The study used 2008 ANES data
to compare conservatives, moderates, and liberals by educa-
tion on several characteristics, values, and actions. Liberalism
was related to higher education, and conversely, conserva-
tism was related to lower education. When respondents were
divided by low and high education and by liberal, moderate,
or conservative philosophy, however, well-educated conser-
vatives were the largest group. The group of better-educated
liberals was less than three fourths that size. Well-educated
liberals, on the whole, were more likely than conservatives to
have graduate work beyond college and were not as affluent
as well-educated conservatives. They also tended to be
younger and were less likely to be married.
Authoritarianism and its kindred constructs are related to
lower public affairs knowledge (McLeod & Perse, 1994;
Mutz, 1987; Peterson et al., 2002; Simmons & Garda, 1982).
This may occur even when authoritarians hold strong opin-
ions about political matters (Peterson et al., 2002). Others
have found that education tends to have a negative relation
with authoritarianism (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson,
& Sanford, 1950; Marcus, Sullivan, Theiss-Morse, & Wood,
1995; Stone, Lederer, & Christie, 1993). Formal schooling
may have a liberalizing effect on authoritarian attitudes
because of increased cognitive development, sophistication,
and abstract thinking; increased opportunity to meet people
of varied backgrounds; augmented political expertise, and
understanding of the importance of democratic principles;
and improved self-esteem (Altemeyer, 1988; Marcus et al.,
1995; Stone et al., 1993; Templeton, 1966). These character-
istics are related to exposure to information, receptiveness to
new ideas and experiences, and general curiosity (McCrae,
1996; Peterson et al., 2002; Peterson, Smirles, & Wentworth,
1997).
In many respects, the characteristics of more-educated
liberals contrasted sharply with those of more-educated con-
servatives and evoked the picture of divergent cultures.
More-educated liberals differed from all the other groups in
a number of ways, including a greater tendency to be younger,
female, non-White, employed, less religious, more oriented
toward thinking and complex problem solving, and more
opinionated than others. They varied markedly from other
groups in their child rearing values. They tended more than
others to have encountered the 2008 presidential campaign
in magazines and on the Internet, to not have military
service, and to be willing to self-identify as homosexual or
bisexual.
The regression analysis on ideology produced an image of
stronger conservatives as being well-to-do White males who
are more religious, inclined to interpret the Bible literally,
and more authoritarian in their views on child rearing. They
tend to have difficulty in seeing the viewpoints of others,
distrust the media, and may possibly have more constricted
information environments than others (although results that
could have supported this latter assertion did not attain statis-
tical significance).
Other research has shown that conservatives appear to
live in increasingly insular environments, further segregated
by influences of the media of the New Right. Not trusting the
major media to cover news fairly was a predictor of conser-
vatism. This echoes the finding that conservatives, especially
if more educated, tend to have lower trust in science (Gauchat,
2012) and greater skepticism about President Barack
Obama's having been born in the United States, especially
with higher attentiveness to conservative media outlets
(Blake & Chen, 2012).
The portrait of diverging cultures based on differences in
ideology supports the "belief-knowledge" gap hypothesis
offered by Gaziano and Gaziano (1999):
As the infusion of mass media information into society
increases, certain groups will tend to acquire this information at
a faster rate than other groups, so that the gap in knowledge
between these groups tends to increase because of differences
in their social construction of knowledge--that is, their cultures.
(p. 130)
Such a conceptualization recalls recent writings describ-
ing "culture wars" based on ideological differences (Fiorina,
Abrams, & Pope, 2011; Hunter, 1992; Thomson, 2010;
Zimmerman, 2002). When issues are controversial, which
groups will prevail in defining what constitutes knowledge,
depends in part, on their access to, and influence by, elite and
powerful organizations, factions, and other groups.
While many knowledge gap studies and some belief gap
studies have focused on education as an indicator of SES,
none has considered situations in which education and
income might define opposing groups, because education,
income, and occupation tend to be related. The results for
household income suggest that when knowledge or belief
gaps based on differences in ideology occur, one of the most
powerful underlying explanations is income, as Gauchat
(2012) has proposed. Larger household incomes may be
more important than education in creating ideology gaps. A
comparison of correlations of ideology with education and
income in several polls in Table 6 shows this pattern, includ-
ing three of five from Hindman's (2009) study that reported
significant results for income. Results for only one poll out
of nine polls depart from this pattern (note that results dis-
play the more stringent two-tailed significance values).
14 SAGE Open
It appears that income, combined with conservatism, may
now come to play an unexpected and complicating part in
defining beliefs about the facts of issues or interpretations of
the facts. High incomes may trump high education in boost-
ing some groups' social influence, including access to pow-
erful interest groups. These findings suggest a reformulation
of the belief gap hypothesis as follows:
Under the condition of increasing social conflict, as the infusion
of mass media information into a social system increases, groups
with greater social power will tend to define the meaning of
information in ways that benefit them, so that the gap in
interpretation of what constitutes knowledge tends to increase
rather than decrease between groups with greater and lesser
social power.
The relationship of ideology and income may strengthen
over time if the relationship of ideology and partisanship is
increasingly correlated, as some observe (Abramowitz &
Saunders, 2005; McCright & Dunlap, 2011). Dissimilarity in
religious and child rearing values may further reinforce the
differences between better-educated liberals and other groups
in the future as their children come of age. Perhaps differ-
ences between liberals and conservatives in sheer numbers,
culture, marital status, number of children, education,
incomes, and access to influential interest groups may play a
role in amassing social power, as well.

 9. Self-direction becomes the antecedent and consequent variable
in perceptions of opportunity, openness to innovation, efficacy,
tolerance of dissent and differences, trust in others, and reli-
ance on internal processes. In contrast, an orientation toward
conformity tends to relate to attitudes of intolerance, alien-
ation, fatalism, and distrust, as well as reliance on perceived
external consequences of actions and attitudes--an orientation
toward obedience to authority often provides some structure
and meaning to situations and forces that appear beyond one's
control or comprehension.
