Abstract
A preference for smooth curvature, as opposed to angularity, is a well-established finding for lines,
two-dimensional shapes, and complex objects, but little is known about individual differences.
We used two-dimensional black-and-white shapes--randomly generated irregular polygons, and
arrays of circles and hexagons--and measured many individual differences, including artistic
expertise, personality, and cognitive style. As expected, people preferred curved over angular
stimuli, and people's degree of curvature preference correlated across the two sets of shapes.
Multilevel models showed varying patterns of interaction between shape and individual differences.
For the irregular polygons, people higher in artistic expertise or openness to experience showed a
greater preference for curvature. This pattern was not evident for the arrays of circles and
hexagons. We discuss the results in relation to the nature of the stimuli, and we conclude that
individual differences do play a role in moderating the preference for smooth curvature.

Introduction
People show a small but consistent preference for the round over the sharp, for the curvy over
the pointy, when judging lines, shapes, abstract objects, and artifacts. This overall preference
for curvature is now firmly established (Go
´ mez-Puerto, Munar, & Nadal, 2015; for its
historical context, see Bertamini & Palumbo, 2015) but not well understood. In the present
research, we sought to illuminate this effect by examining individual differences in curvature
preferences. Whether people differ in their preferences for curvature has been explored in only
a handful of studies (e.g., Silvia & Barona, 2009), and the findings so far are inconsistent.
Examining the role of individual differences in these preferences will thus extend research to
date and inform the broader question of why people prefer curved over angular objects.
The Robustness of Curvature Preferences
The notion that curved lines and objects are more pleasing has a long history in writings on
aesthetics (e.g., Hogarth, 1753) and in empirical research. In early studies, curved lines were
seen as quiet and lazy (Lundholm, 1921; Poffenberger & Barrows, 1924) or graceful and
playful (Hevner, 1935), while angular lines were seen as agitating (Lundholm, 1921;
Poffenberger & Barrows, 1924), harsh (Poffenberger & Barrows, 1924), or dignified
(Hevner, 1935). Similar patterns were found when fonts were adjusted to be more rounded
or angular (Kastl & Child, 1968).
During the past decade, researchers have revisited this issue of angularity and preference
and have consistently found that people prefer curved things. This holds true for lines
(Bertamini, Palumbo, Gheorges, & Galatsidas, 2016; Salgado-Montejo, Tapia Leon, Elliot,
Salgado, & Spence, 2015), abstract novel shapes (Bar & Neta, 2006; Bertamini et al., 2016;
Silvia & Barona, 2009; Velasco et al., 2016), common objects (Bar & Neta, 2006; Westerman
et al., 2012), car interiors (Leder & Carbon, 2005), and interior architectural environments
(Dazkir & Read, 2012; van Oel & van den Berkhof, 2013; Vartanian et al., 2013). Even
infants (Jadva, Hines, & Golombok, 2010; Quinn, Brown, & Streppa, 1997) and great apes
(Munar, Go
´ mez-Puerto, Call, & Nadal, 2015) demonstrate this preference. The effect appears
to stem from an appealing quality of curved things that motivates approach (Bertamini et al.,
2016; Palumbo, Ruta, & Bertamini, 2015) instead of a threatening quality of angular, sharp
things (Bar & Neta, 2006, 2007) that motivates avoidance.
Despite consistent evidence pointing to a preference for smooth curvature, however, the
history of art suggests that preference for shapes is a complex phenomenon. Hogarth (1753),
in his treatise on beauty, pronounced a wavy line as the line of beauty, but culture and artistic
canons seem to matter as well. For instance, abstract plasticism is a style associated with Piet
Mondrian (1872­1944) and characterized by simple straight lines and a complete absence of
curves. This can be contrasted with abstract expressionism, associated with Jackson Pollock
(1912­1956). In Pollock's case, the paintings include splatters of paints that have an organic
aspect and therefore include smooth curves reminiscent of those present in the natural
environment (Taylor, Micolich, & Jonas, 1999; Taylor, Spehar, Van Donkelaar, &
Hagerhall, 2011).
What Moderates Curvature Preferences?
Aspects of Stimuli and Tasks
On the one hand, the preference for curvature is solid and consistent, but on the other
hand, it is necessary to study its boundary conditions, moderators, and mechanisms.
2 i-Perception
Several within-person factors--aspects of the stimuli themselves--affect these preferences.
For example, when semantic knowledge of the objects is relevant--such as curvy bombs and
pointy teddy bears (Leder, Tinio, & Bar, 2011)--it can wash out the effects of low-level
features like angularity. Likewise, cultural trends in product design can shape the
background against which objects are evaluated (Carbon, 2010).
One factor worth examining is the kind of emotional response measured in studies of
curvature. To date, the overwhelming focus has been on preference: The positively
valenced appeal of curvy things, measured with self-report items associated with pleasing,
likeable, and positive and with behavioral measures of choice and approach. Aesthetics
research, for good reason, focuses heavily on positive feelings of liking and preference
(Silvia, 2012). Nevertheless, pleasure and interest are distinct responses, and many pleasing
things are not interesting (Graf & Landwehr, 2015). Many studies, from Berlyne's (1971)
early work to the present (Markovic
´ , 2012; Silvia & Kashdan, in press), show that liking and
interest respond differently to low-level features like complexity and familiarity. It is possible
that angular objects are less pleasing but more interesting, consistent with greater interest in
objects that are complex, variable, and heterogeneous (Silvia, 2006).
Aspects of People
At the between-person level--factors that differ between participants--little is known about
variables that affect curvature preferences. Thus far, expertise in the arts has received the most
attention. Compared with novices, people with training in the visual arts see, think about, and
appreciate art differently (Parsons, 1987; Smith & Smith, 2006). In particular, a common finding
is that experts are less affected by low-level, superficial features of a work (e.g., whether it depicts
objects and colors people like) and more sensitive to compositional and historical features (e.g.,
Cleeremans, Ginsburgh, Klein, & Noury, 2016; Locher, 1996; Lundy, 2010; Parsons, 1987;
Silvia, 2013). Because they think about art in deeper, more complex ways, art experts might
be less affected by low-level visual features that appeal to novices. In two studies, Silvia and
Barona (2009) found puzzling effects of expertise. In one study, novices showed stronger
curvature preferences; in another, experts showed stronger curvature preferences.
Individual differences beyond expertise have not been explored. An obvious candidate is
openness to experience, a trait that pops up throughout the psychology of aesthetics and
creativity (Oleynick et al., 2017). People high in openness to experience are more engaged
with the arts: They are more likely to find the arts interesting and valuable, have much
more knowledge about art, and have formal or informal training in the fine and performing
arts (McCrae, 1996; Silvia, 2007). More generally, people high in openness to experience are
more imaginative, creative, unconventional, and sensitive to subtle emotions (Kaufman, 2013;
McCrae & Sutin, 2009). Unlike art expertise, which develops over many years and is positively
skewed, openness to experience is apparent early in life. Personality traits like openness to
experience do develop, of course, but they are considered universal features of people (Nettle,
2009) rather than domains of acquired knowledge that some people choose to pursue.
The Present Research
The present research delves deeper into preference for smooth curvature by exploring
moderators, with an emphasis on individual differences. Our primary aim was to examine
whether some people have stronger curvature preferences and to characterize the traits
associated with such preferences. Variation in curvature preferences is an intriguing issue
that, ideally, can inform theorizing about the basic mechanisms behind the preferences.
Cotter et al. 3
In the present study, a sample of young adults viewed and rated a set of randomly
generated irregular polygons that varied in complexity (Bertamini et al., 2016). In
addition, they also viewed and rated a set of arrays containing circles and hexagons that
varied in degree of balance within a frame (Silvia & Barona, 2009). This second set was used
to replicate past work and to see if curvature preferences were consistent across the sets. If
preference for curvature is partly due to stable between-person factors, they should be
consistent: People's degree of curvature preferences should correlate across the tasks.
Finally, we collected ratings of both liking and interest and measured viewing times to see
if curved objects are more pleasing but less interesting and if curvature predicts how long
people viewed an image. We expected, based on past work, to find an overall increase in
liking for curved objects.
We included a wide range of measures of individual differences. Our approach was guided
by past research on important factors in aesthetic judgment and preference. We focused on
three classes of factors. First, we measured art expertise, a major moderator of aesthetic
preferences and processes that had inconsistent effects on curvature preference in past work
(Silvia & Barona, 2009). Second, we measured openness to experience, another major trait
involved in people's engagement with the arts and aesthetic preferences. We measured
openness to experience with a cluster of scales that emphasize its different aspects
(Oleynick et al., 2017). Finally, we measured a cluster of traits associated with systematic
or deliberate versus heuristic or intuitive processing styles, such as need for cognition
(Cacioppo, Petty, & Feng, 1984) and types of intuitive thinking (Pretz et al., 2014). This
family of traits has not been widely studied in arts and aesthetics research, so these scales
were included for essentially exploratory reasons.
Method
Participants
Participants were 132 undergraduate students enrolled in psychology classes who volunteered
as part of a class research participation option. Thirteen people were excluded from the
analyses due to exceeding the cutoff for inattentive responses (more than two) on an
infrequency scale (see Maniaci & Rogge, 2014; McKibben & Silvia, in press, 2016). This
resulted in a final sample size of 119 people, which is the basis of the following analyses. The
final sample of 119 was primarily female (61%) and diverse in self-reported race and ethnicity
(people could select more than one category): European American (48%), African-American
(41%), Asian-American (10%), Hispanic (5%), and Native American (5%). On average,
participants were 18.92 years old (SD ¼ 1.28). The university has popular programs related
to the fine and performing arts, and 12% of the participants had majors or minors in some
area of the arts (primarily fine art, art history, dance, theatre, and music; see Silvia &
Nusbaum, 2012).
Procedure
Participants completed the study in small groups in a lab setting. Once participants provided
informed consent, the researcher explained the broad purpose of the study. Participants then
began the experiment, which was administered on individual computers using MediaLab. All
participants viewed and rated the irregular polygons at the start of the study, followed by the
arrays of circles and hexagons. All measures of individual differences were taken afterward.
The study took around 45 minutes to complete.

Materials
Irregular polygons. Our stimulus set was a subset of randomly generated polygons created by
Bertamini et al. (2016) and Palumbo and Bertamini (2016). By design they had some degree
of complexity (so that they differed visibly one from the other) but they did not resemble any
familiar object, nor were they composed of simple geometric parts (i.e., they could not be
described, for instance, as two circles or a square and a hexagon). Figure 1 shows examples,
and the full set is available on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/vrjyp/). The stimuli
were created by selecting locations along a circle, and by varying the length of the radius
(between a minimum and a maximum value). This process created polygons with 10, 18, or 26
vertices. Next, polygons were altered to generate curved variants. To do so, a smooth curve
was created by using a cubic spline applied to the original polygon. Complexity was also
varied by using two values of the range of the radius used (i.e., the difference between the
minimum and the maximum radius values). There were two levels of range, and they
produced a difference in the amplitude of the indentations. The combination of factors
(number of vertices ¼ 3, range ¼ 2, curvature ¼ 2) gives 12 types of shapes. We used two
sets for a total of 24 images. The images appeared in a random order. The participants
could view each image for as long as they wished, but the images stayed on screen for at
least 2 seconds. People clicked the mouse or space bar to advance to the ratings, and the
viewing time was recorded by the software.
After each image, participants gave ratings of pleasantness (How PLEASANT is this
image? 1 ¼ Not at all pleasant, 7 ¼ Very pleasant), interest (How INTERESTING is this
image? 1 ¼ Not at all interesting, 7 ¼ Very interesting), and complexity (How COMPLEX
is this image? 1 ¼ Not at all complex, 7 ¼ Very complex). The ratings appeared in the same
fixed order for all items and participants.
Preference for Balance Test. The Preference for Balance Test (Wilson & Chatterjee, 2005) was
included to attempt to replicate past research (Silvia & Barona, 2009) and to evaluate if
curvature preferences were consistent across different kinds of images. The Preference for
Balance Test consists of arrays of circles (curved) and hexagons (angular). Eighteen images
were presented: nine containing circles and nine containing hexagons. For each set of nine
images, there were three images for each of three levels of imbalance (low, medium, and
high). Sample stimuli are shown in Figure 2; all 18 images are available at Open Science
Framework (https://osf.io/vrjyp/). This set was used in our past research (Silvia & Barona,
2009, Study 1). The images appeared in a random order. People clicked the mouse or space
bar to advance to the ratings, and the viewing time was recorded by the software.
After each image, participants gave ratings of pleasantness (How PLEASANT is this
image? 1 ¼ Not at all pleasant, 7 ¼ Very pleasant) and interest (How INTERESTING is
this image? 1 ¼ Not at all interesting, 7 ¼ Very interesting). The ratings appeared in the
same fixed order for all items and participants.
Measures of Individual Differences
Aesthetic fluency scale. This scale was used to assess artistic expertise (Smith & Smith, 2006).
Ten people or ideas from art history (e.g., impressionism and fauvism) were presented, and
the participants rated how familiar they were with each one on a scale from 0 (I have never
heard of this artist or term) to 4 (I can talk intelligently about this artist or idea in art).
Cotter et al. 5
This scale has been used in many past studies as a brief measure of people's knowledge of the
arts (e.g., Silvia, 2007, 2013; Swami, 2013).
HEXACO 100 Personality Inventory­Revised. This inventory consisted of 100 items measuring six
domains of personality: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality (Neuroticism), eXtraversion,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience (Lee & Ashton, 2004).
Each item was rated on a scale of 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). We were
primarily interested in openness to experience and its facets--aesthetic appreciation,
inquisitiveness, creativity, and unconventionality--so only these scales were included in the
analyses.
NEO-Five-Factor Inventory. This 60-item scale measures five domains of personality:
Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness
(Costa & McCrae, 1992). Each item was rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly Agree) to

in the number of sides (three levels) and in their range (two levels).

5 (Strongly Disagree). As our interest was in openness to experience, we examined only this
domain in our analyses.
Big Five Aspects Scale. We used the Openness or Intellect subscale of the Big Five Aspects Scale
(BFAS; DeYoung, Quilty, & Peterson, 2007). This 20-item subscale measures two aspects of
openness to experience: Openness and Intellect. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (Strongly
Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
Need for Cognition. This 18-item questionnaire was used to assess how much people engage in
and enjoy thinking (Cacioppo et al., 1984). Each statement was rated on a scale from 1
(Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Sample items include ``I only think as hard as
I have to'' and ``I feel relief rather than satisfaction after completing a task that required a lot
of mental effort.''
Types of Intuition Scale. This scale was used to examine the ways in which people make
decisions and solve problems (Pretz et al., 2014). Twenty-three statements (e.g., ``I would
rather think in terms of theories than facts''; ``There is a logical justification for most of
my intuitive judgments'') were rated on a scale from 1 (Definitely False) to 5 (Definitely
True). These statements are grouped into four subscales: Holistic Abstract (thinking
about a problem in abstract terms), Holistic Big Picture (focusing on the entire problem
rather than details of the situation), Inferential (making decisions based on automatic,
analytic processes), and Affective (making decisions by relying on emotional reactions to a
situation).

stimuli had three levels of imbalance: low (left), medium (middle), and high imbalance (right).

Results
Multilevel Analysis
The design had both within-person factors (e.g., curved vs. angular images) as well as
between-person factors (e.g., art expertise and openness to experience; see Table 1). The
data were thus analyzed with multilevel models, which can flexibly model such designs.
The analyses were run with maximum likelihood and robust standard errors in Mplus 7.4.
The slopes and intercepts were random.
In this design, individual differences were factors that varied between people (Level 2), and
aspects of the images (their curvature, complexity, and imbalance) were factors that varied
within people (Level 1). For the irregular polygons, curvature was coded as 0 (angular) and 1
(curved), number of sides was coded as 0 (low), 1 (medium), and 2 (high), and range was
coded as 0 (low) or 1 (high). Similarly, for the preference for balance arrays, curvature was
coded as 0 (hexagons) and 1 (circles), and imbalance was coded as 0 (low), 1 (medium),
and 2 (high imbalance). The Level 2 predictors (e.g., scales measuring art expertise and
personality traits) were standardized, which centers them at 0 (the sample mean) and
places them on the same standard deviation scale. Unless noted otherwise, all the
regression coefficients are unstandardized. The intraclass correlations (ICCs) showed that
around 40% of the variance in ratings of pleasantness (ICCs ¼ .40 for the polygons, .47
for the circle or hexagon arrays) and interest (ICCs ¼ .39 for the polygons, .42 for the
circle or hexagon arrays) was at Level 2.
Did People Prefer Curved Objects?
Based on past work, we expected that participants would prefer the curved objects more than
the angular ones (see Figure 3). For the irregular polygons, participants reported liking the
curved polygons more than the angular ones (b ¼ .27, SE ¼ .10, p ¼ .005). Additionally,
people liked polygons with more sides (b ¼ .11, SE ¼ .05, p ¼ .036), which replicates the
classic effect of complexity on preference (e.g., Berlyne, 1971).1

For the imbalanced arrays of circles and hexagons, people again showed a preference for
curvature. Ratings of pleasantness were higher for the arrays of curved circles than the
angular hexagons (b ¼ .19, SE ¼ .10, p ¼ .070), although the effect was weaker than for the
irregular polygons. Neither the level of imbalance nor the interaction between curvature and
imbalance significantly predicted liking.
Was Curvature Preference Consistent?
There was an overall preference for curvature for both irregular polygons and arrays of
simple circles and hexagons. To see if there were individual differences in the tendency to
prefer curved forms, we estimated the correlation between curvature preference for the
irregular polygons and for the imbalanced arrays of circles and hexagons. For each set, a
difference score was computed that reflected the difference in liking between the curved and
the angular images. The correlation between curvature preference for the irregular polygons

circles and hexagons (bottom). Error bars represent standard errors.

and for the circle and hexagon arrays was significant (r ¼ .32 [.15, .50], p < .001) and medium
in effect size (Cumming, 2012).
It thus appears that there were consistent between-person differences in curvature
preference: People who preferred curved objects in one stimulus set were likely to prefer
the curved objects in the other stimulus set.
What Moderated Preference for Curvature?
The remaining question is to explore predictors of these between-person differences in
preferences for curvature. We thus conducted multilevel models that examined between-
person factors, such as personality traits and art expertise, to see if some factors predicted
stronger curvature preferences. For simplicity, the irregular polygons and circle-hexagon
arrays were analyzed separately, and only the main effect of curvature was included in the
model (i.e., imbalance, complexity, and range were omitted). Note that because the between-
person predictors are standardized, the coefficients represent the predicted change in the
difference between curved and angular images for each 1 SD change in the predictor.
Irregular polygons. The first column of Table 2 shows the moderating effects of the between-
person variables on curvature preferences. Some of the traits did significantly moderate
preference. First, art expertise significantly enhanced the curvature effect: People who had
higher scores on the aesthetic fluency scale showed a stronger preference for the curved over
the angular polygons (b ¼ .21, SE¼ .09, p ¼ .021). Second, several of the scales measuring
openness to experience showed similar effects. Curvature preferences were significantly greater
for people scoring higher on the NEO openness to experience scale (b ¼ .25, SE¼ .08, p ¼ .002)
and the HEXACO unconventionality facet (b ¼ .41, SE¼ .10, p < .001); the increase was

marginal for the overall HEXACO Openness to Experience scale (b ¼ .16, SE¼ .09, p ¼ .083)
and the BFAS Openness scale (b ¼ .15, SE ¼ .08, p ¼ .077). Finally, the Holistic Abstract
subscale of the Types of Intuition Scale significantly moderated curvature preference: People
who like thinking in abstract terms preferred the curved polygons more (b ¼ .21, SE¼ .08,
p ¼ .008). None of the other individual differences we investigated was significant (see Table
2). Overall, then, a consistent profile appeared for the irregular polygons.
Circles and hexagons. For the arrays of circles and hexagons, however, only one moderator was
significant and another was marginal. As scores on the BFAS Intellect (b ¼ À.15, SE ¼ .08,
p ¼ .040) and the need for cognition (b ¼ À.17, SE ¼ .09, p ¼ .068) scales increased, people
tended to prefer the angular hexagons relatively more than the round circles. Otherwise, the
effects for art expertise and openness to experience that appeared for the irregular polygons
did not appear for the arrays (see Table 2).
Does Curvature Affect Interest?
Our secondary aim was to investigate whether interest was influenced by curvature (see
Figure 3). Angularity did not influence interest in the irregular polygon stimulus set
(b ¼ À.07, SE ¼ .10, p ¼ .463). Both the number of sides and range, however, affected
interest. Shapes with more sides (b ¼ .56, SE ¼ .06, p < .001) and a higher range (b ¼ .33,
SE ¼ .09, p < .001) were associated with increased interest ratings, consistent with a large
body of work on complexity and interest (Silvia, 2006). The two-way interaction and the
three-way interaction were not significant.
Similarly, in the circle and hexagons stimulus set, interest was not influenced by curvature
(b ¼ À.14, SE ¼ .11, p ¼ .21). The level of imbalance and the two-way interaction did not
significantly affect interest ratings. In short, curved objects were pleasing, but angular objects
did not appear to be more interesting.
Did Curvature Affect Viewing Time?
Finally, we explored how curvature affected viewing time. As noted earlier, people could view
each image as long as they wished with a minimum of 2 seconds. On average, people viewed
the images for around 3.6 seconds (M ¼ 3.57, SD ¼ 1.66 for the irregular polygons; M ¼ 3.65,
SD ¼ 1.90 for the circles and hexagons).
For the irregular polygons, there was a significant main effect of curvature (b ¼ À.30,
SE ¼ .10, p ¼ .002): People spent more time looking at the angular polygons than the
rounded ones. There was also a main effect of the number of sides (b ¼ .13, SE ¼ .07,
p ¼ .048): Viewing time increased as the number of sides increased, a finding that replicates
many studies from the Berlyne tradition of experimental aesthetics (e.g., Berlyne, 1974).
Finally, there was a significant interaction between curvature and range (b ¼ .30, SE ¼ .14,
p ¼ .034): People spent more time viewing curved objects with a larger range.
For the arrays of circles and hexagons, there was no main effect of curvature on viewing
time (b ¼ À.06, SE ¼ .12, p ¼ .640). The only significant effect was a main effect of imbalance
(b ¼ À.14, SE ¼ .05, p ¼ .009): People spent more time viewing the more balanced arrays.
Discussion
Among the many low-level features that affect aesthetic preference, curvature stands out as
having an unusually strong evidence base. Preference for curved over angular forms has been
Cotter et al. 11
demonstrated across decades, age-groups, cultures, and species (see Go
´ mez-Puerto et al.,
2015). When a main effect has been firmly established, a natural next step is to explore
moderators. Marking the boundaries of an effect can illuminate its nature. Such
illumination would be particularly welcome in the case of curvature preferences, which are
robust yet mysterious--the effect is clearly there, but it is not obvious why adults, babies, and
great apes would prefer the curved to the angular.
The present research examined individual differences in relation to curvature preferences.
First, a preference for curved objects was found in both a set of irregular polygons and in
arrays of circles and hexagons, replicating much past research. Second, we found evidence for
individual differences in curvature preference itself. People's liking for curved over angular
shapes was consistent across the two stimulus sets, with a medium effect size. The consistency
of people's preferences across the types of shapes suggests the presence of individual
differences that influence how much people prefer curved over angular forms.
The evidence for moderating traits, however, was a bit vexing. For one stimulus set--
the irregular polygons generated and studied by Bertamini et al. (2016)--the evidence for
moderation was plentiful and consistent. People with more knowledge about the arts,
measured with the aesthetic fluency scale, showed greater curvature preferences, as did people
higher in openness to experience, measured with the NEO, HEXACO, and BFAS. Thus, the
participants who were more interested and knowledgeable showed a stronger relative preference
for curved over angular polygons. Unlike other low-level factors that appear largely among
novices, such as preferences for realistic over abstract images (Parsons, 1987), curvature
preference was heightened among people with greater knowledge and interest in art, at least
for this set of images. But for the other stimulus set--the arrays of circles and hexagons
developed to study pictorial imbalance (Wilson & Chatterjee, 2005)--only a handful of
effects appeared, and none were the same as in the set of irregular polygons.
Preference for curvature has been reported before for abstract stimuli (Bertamini et al.,
2016) and for circles and hexagons (Silvia & Barona, 2009). Our study shows that beyond
this similarity, the nature of the stimuli can be moderated differently by individual
differences. For the irregular polygons, artistic expertise and openness to experience were
significant predictors of preference for curvature. This was not visible for circles and
hexagons. The irregular polygons were novel, whereas circles and hexagons are familiar
objects. For instance, people possess linguistic labels for circles and hexagons, which come
with a set of established semantic associations, such as between a circle and a ball, or
between a hexagon and a beehive. It is likely that these stimuli already possess valence. It
has been shown that valence can take precedence over curvature, and that in such cases,
preferences for smooth curvature may be secondary (Leder et al., 2011). We conclude that
there is a strong case for studying preference for shape properties using shapes that are
novel and unfamiliar and that vary from trial to trial (i.e., they have a range of shapes,
rather than just two).
Viewing time, along with pleasingness and interestingness, is one of the classic outcomes in
experimental aesthetics research. To date, research on curvature has used a wide range of
image exposures, such as under 100 ms (Bar & Neta, 2006; Munar et al., 2015) to 3 seconds
(Vartanian et al., 2013), or has used free viewing without recording viewing times (e.g.,
Bertamini et al., 2016; Silvia & Barona, 2009, Study 2). In the present study, viewing time
was influenced by some classic predictors, such as complexity and imbalance. In addition,
for the irregular polygons, people spent more time viewing the angular shapes. The reason for
this effect is unclear, but it does rule out a simple exposure explanation for the preference
for curved objects. People overall preferred curved objects but did not spend more time
viewing them, so preference is not merely due to exposure time.
12 i-Perception
Future work could vary presentation times to clarify why art expertise and openness to
experience moderate people's preference for curved objects. It is surprising that people with
more expertise show greater curvature preferences because experts are often less affected by
low-level aesthetic factors and more affected by formal training and domain knowledge (e.g.,
Haertel & Carbon, 2014; Parsons, 1987). It is possible that the free-viewing format allowed
time for the effects of past experience and conceptual knowledge to materialize, so it would be
worth varying presentation times and evaluating if traits like art expertise moderate
preferences only at long viewing intervals. In addition, it would be worth greatly
expanding the number of stimuli. We used relatively few in the current study to expand
the time available for two tasks and many self-report questionnaires. Increasing the
number of images could increase power for within-person effects.
A secondary question was whether curvature had different effects on liking and interest. It
seemed possible that angular forms would seem more intriguing and interesting, given the
large literature on how features associated with complexity, tension, and variety affect
interest (Berlyne, 1971; Silvia, 2006). No evidence was found for effects on interest. The
curved polygons and circle arrays were more pleasing, but the angular polygons and
hexagon arrays were not any more or less interesting.
In sum, the present study found evidence for individual differences in curvature
preferences. Some people showed stronger preference for curvature, and this preference
was consistent for two very different types of shapes. The degree to which individual-
difference factors moderated these preferences varied as a function of the type of shapes,
suggesting that the familiarity of the shapes may be an important moderator of curvature
preferences to examine in future research.

Note
1. Range was of secondary interest, but it did have some notable interactions. Range did not have a
significant main effect on preference ratings (b ¼ .02, SE ¼ .08, p ¼ .772). The two-way interaction
Cotter et al. 13
between curvature and range, however, was significant (b ¼ .44, SE ¼ .12, p < .001): Participants
liked the polygons more when both curvature and range were high. The two-way interactions
between curvature and number of sides, and range and number of sides were not significant. A
three-way interaction indicated that when curvature, number of sides, and range were high,
participants liked the polygons less (b ¼ À.24, SE ¼ .08, p ¼ .004).
