Abstract
Objective: To assess the association between the 2184A/G polymorphism in the advanced
glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER) gene and the susceptibility to diabetic
retinopathy (DR) in Han Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods: This cross-sectional genotyping study included patients with T2DM with and without
DR. Genotype and allele frequencies of the 2184A/G polymorphism were detected using
polymerase chain reaction­restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis.
Results: This study included 943 patients with T2DM (285 with DR [DR group] and 658 without
DR [NDR group]). There were no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, total
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diastolic
blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, postprandial 2-hour blood
glucose, and triglycerides between the two groups. The duration of T2DM and systolic blood
pressure were significantly increased in the DR group compared with the NDR group. No
significant differences were found in allele (A and G) and genotype (AA, AG and GG) frequencies of
the 2184A/G polymorphism between the two groups.

Introduction
The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) in China is a cause for
concern, with approximately 92.4 million
adults aged !20 years reported to be
affected in 2010 according to the Chinese
Diabetes Society.1,2 Diabetic retinopathy
(DR) is a common microvascular complica-
tion of diabetes mellitus; occurring in
approximately 35.7% of patients with
T2DM in China and being the principal
cause of vision loss and blindness in the
adult population.3
Hyperglycaemia results in the formation
and accumulation of advanced glycation
end-products (AGEs) as well as upregulated
expression of their cellular receptor (RAGE)
in the diabetic vasculature.4­6 The AGE/
RAGE interaction plays an important role
in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascu-
lar complications,7 including retinal capil-
lary degeneration, which is a characteristic
of retinopathy in diabetic animal models
and patients.8 Retinal capillaries are the
targets of AGE-induced toxicity,9 including
the induction of retinal pericyte apoptosis
and the osteoblastic differentiation and cal-
cification of pericytes.10,11 The AGE/RAGE
interaction in retinal microvascular endo-
thelial cells results in cellular activation,
including: (i) the activation of nuclear
factor-kB;4 (ii) increased expression of cyto-
kines, such as vascular endothelial growth
factor, which is associated with blood­
retinal barrier dysfunction;12 (iii) upregula-
tion of adhesion molecules, such as intercel-
lular adhesion molecule, which mediates
retinal capillary leukocyte adherence and
inner blood­retinal barrier breakdown;13
and (iv) the induction of oxidative stress;6
all of which are involved in the pathogenesis
of DR.14­16 Furthermore, the inhibition of
RAGE blocks the development of DR
lesions.15
Genetic polymorphisms in the advanced
glycosylation end product-specific receptor
(AGER) gene may alter its activity following
AGE binding, which in turn might influence
the development of diabetic vascular com-
plications. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) protein
is a naturally occurring competitive inhibi-
tor of the pathological effects induced by
RAGE; it is produced by alternative splicing
of the RAGE mRNA, which involves the
regions between intron 7 and 9.17,18 The
2184A/G polymorphism, which is located
on intron 8 of the AGER gene, has been
postulated to be involved in the regulation
of sRAGE production.18 The 2184A/G
polymorphism was reported to be associated
with antioxidant status.19 It was also
reported to be associated with diabetes-
associated microvascular dermatoses in
patients with T2DM.20
In light of the strong association between
DR and retinal oxidant status and micro-
vascular lesions,8,9 it can be hypothesized
that the 2184A/G polymorphism may con-
tribute to the pathogenesis of DR by
Li et al. 521
influencing the AGE­sRAGE balance. The
aim of this present study was to investigate
the association between the 2184A/G poly-
morphism and DR in Han Chinese patients
with T2DM. This information will be
important in understanding the influence
of ethnic background on the association
between AGER gene polymorphisms and
DR, which might provide a basis for under-
standing the mechanism by which RAGE
contributes to DR.
Patients and methods
Study population
This cross-sectional genotyping study
enrolled consecutive Han Chinese patients
with T2DM in the Department of
Endocrinology and Metabolism, First
Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang
University, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province,
China between June 2010 and December
2012. Family trees were used to ensure their
Han Chinese ethnic background. T2DM
was diagnosed according to the 2003
American Diabetes Association diagnostic
criteria for diabetes,21 based on a fasting
blood glucose (FBG) >7 mmol/l, a causal
blood glucose >11.1 mmol/l, or a postpran-
dial 2-h blood glucose (2hBG) >11.1 mmol/l
following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test,
or a history of therapy for diabetes. All
patients underwent a complete eye examin-
ation that included dilated retinal examin-
ation and fundus photography or fundus
fluorescein angiography using a TRC-
50DX Mydriatic Retinal Camera (Topcon
Medical Systems, Oakland, NJ, USA), and
DR was diagnosed as previously reported.22
The patients with T2DM were divided into
two subgroups: those with retinopathy
(DR) and those without retinopathy
(NDR). Demographic and clinical data
including age, sex, body mass index, dur-
ation of T2DM, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure were recorded for each study
participant.
The exclusion criteria were: (i) those aged
<20 or >40 years; (ii) patients with type 1
diabetes mellitus, acute infection, the acute
stage of a chronic infectious disease, inflam-
matory disease, uterine disorders, severe
liver or renal disease; (iii) patients with eye
diseases, spontaneous miscarriages or
embryo transplant failures on more than
three occasions; (iv) patients taking drugs or
therapies that might affect reproductive or
metabolic functions; (v) patients with endo-
metrial thickness <7 mm on the secretory
transformation day; (vi) patients who were
unable to comply with the study protocol.
The reproductive system-related exclusion
criteria were necessary because fundus fluor-
escein angiography is contraindicated in
pregnant women.
This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of
Nanchang University, Nanchang (no.
CDYFY2010029) and written informed
consent was obtained from all study partici-
pants. This study was performed in adher-
ence to the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Biochemical analyses
Venous blood samples were drawn from
each patient by venipuncture after at least an
8-h fast for routine blood biochemical ana-
lyses that included total triglycerides (TG),
total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood
glucose, and glycosylated haemoglobin
(HbA1c
). TG (intra- and inter-assay coeffi-
cients of variation [CVs] of <8% and <9%,
respectively), TC (intra- and inter-assay CVs
of <6% and <9%, respectively), HDL-C
(intra- and inter-assay CVs of <9% and
<11%, respectively), LDL-C (intra- and
inter-assay CVs of <12% and <14%,
respectively) and fasting blood glucose
(intra- and inter-assay CVs of <10% and
<12%, respectively) were analysed using an
522 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
automated Olympus AU5421 high-volume
chemistry immuno analyser (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. HbA1c
(intra- and inter-
assay CVs of <6% and <9%, respectively)
was measured using a Bio-Rad D-10TM
haemoglobin analyser (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). All biochemical analyses were
carried out in triplicate.
Genotyping
For genotyping analysis, genomic DNA was
extracted from 5 ml of peripheral blood
collected in 1.5 mg/ml ethylenediaminete-
tra-acetic acid using a DNA isolation kit
(Bioteke, Beijing, China) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The genomic
DNA was subjected to polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) with the following primers:
forward primer: 50-TAATTTCCTGCCCC
ATTCTG-30, reverse primer: 50-CATCGCA
ATCTATGCCTCCT-30 (Shanghai Sangon
Biological Engineering Technology &
Service, Shanghai, China). The PCR was
performed in a 10 ml reaction volume con-
taining 150 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 mmol/l
of forward and reverse primers, 0.225 U Taq
DNA polymerase (Nearshore Protein
Technology, Shanghai, China), 200 mmol/l
of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate
(Nearshore Protein Technology), and
2.0 mmol/l Mg2þ using an Applied
Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The amplification protocol consisted
of preliminary denaturation at 94C for
5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94C for 20 s, annealing at 58C for 30 s,
and elongation at 72C for 30 s, followed by
a final elongation step at 72C for 5 min.
For restriction fragment-length poly-
morphism analysis, the PCR products were
digested with BsmF1 (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA, USA) for 2 h at 65C.
Digestion products were resolved on a
2.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis at
220 V for 30 min. The 2184G minor allele
mutation introduces a BsmF1 restriction site
into the gene;23 therefore, diagnostic BsmF1
digestion produced fragments of 160 base
pairs (bp) and 236 bp for the mutated minor
allele 2184G, while the wild-type major
allele 2184A, which does not contain this
restriction site, produced a single fragment
of 396 bp in length. Four representative
samples from each genotype were further
sequenced to confirm the overall genotyping
results.
Statistical analyses
The sample size in this study was established
based on a pilot study, which demonstrated
genotype frequencies of 2184AGþGG of
0.20 and 0.17 for the NDR and DR groups,
respectively. With a sample size ratio
between the NDR and DR groups of 2:1,
it was calculated that the total number of
patients needed to achieve 80% power with
a significance level a (two-sided a error) of
0.05 was 862.
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Normally distributed continu-
ous variables are presented as mean Æ SD
and compared with the independent samples
t-test. Variables that were not normally
distributed are presented as median (inter-
quartile range) and compared with the
Mann­Whitney U-test. Categorical vari-
ables and the Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium
were analysed using 2-test. Intergroup
comparisons of genotype and allele distri-
bution were analysed using Fisher's exact
test and 2-test, respectively. A two-sided P-
value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 943 patients with T2DM were
enrolled in the study, including 285 patients
Li et al. 523
in the DR group and 658 in the NDR group,
which was an adequate sample size based on
the power calculation. The demographic
and clinical characteristics for the DR and
NDR groups are shown in Table 1. There
were no significant differences in age, sex
distribution, body mass index, TC, DBP,
HbA1c
, FBG, 2hBG, TG, LDL-C, and
HDL-C between the two groups. The dur-
ation of T2DM and systolic blood pressure
were significantly increased in the DR group
compared with the NDR group (P < 0.05
for both comparisons).
The genotype frequencies of the
2184A/G polymorphism in the DR and
NDR groups were in Hardy­Weinberg equi-
librium. Table 2 shows the allele and geno-
type frequency distribution of the 2184A/G
polymorphism in the NDR and DR groups.
There were no significant differences in the
allele (A and G) and genotype (AA, AG,
and GG) frequencies of the 2184A/G poly-
morphism between the DR and NDR
groups.
Discussion
A number of single nucleotide polymorph-
isms (SNPs) have been identified in the
coding and noncoding regions of the
AGER gene.24 Many studies have investi-
gated the association between various SNPs
in the AGER gene with DR, but the results
of these association studies have been incon-
sistent or even directly conflicting. For
example, some studies suggested that the
AGER polymorphisms À429 T/C, À374 T/
A, Gly82Ser, 1704G/T, and 2245G/A are
associated with DR,16,25­30 while other stu-
dies, including a previous study from our
group, did not support a significant associ-
ation between these polymorphisms

and DR.31­37 These studies also suggested
that these AGER gene polymorphisms have
different distributions in different ethnic
populations, which may be associated with
the different contributions of these muta-
tions against different ethnic back-
grounds.35,36 A significant association
between the Gly82Ser polymorphism in the
AGER gene with DR has been reported in
Asian Indians38,39 and Asian Chinese29 with
T2DM. In contrast, an absence of a signifi-
cant association between the Gly82Ser,
1704G/T, and 2184A/G AGER gene poly-
morphisms and DR has been reported in
Malaysian32 and Japanese37 populations.
For the 2184A/G polymorphism, a few
studies reported that 2184A/G polymorph-
isms were not associated with DR in patients
with T2DM.31,32,40 Of note, a recent report
even showed no association between 2184A/
G polymorphisms and DR in a Chinese
population.40 As the diverse nationalities
within the very large Chinese population
might bring about complexity in the analysis,
this present study performed a cross-sectional
analysis to observe the correlation between
2184A/G polymorphisms and DR in a Han
Chinese population that is representative of
the majority of the Chinese population.
In this present study, there were no stat-
istically significant differences in the genotype
and allele frequencies of the 2184A/G poly-
morphism among the DR and NDR groups,
indicating that the 2184A/G polymorphism
in the AGER gene is not associated with DR
in Han Chinese patients with T2DM. The
results of this present study were similar to
those previously reported.31,32,40 Two
important differences exist between this pre-
sent study and a previous study that also
reported on a Chinese population:40 (i) this
present study exclusively assessed a Han
Chinese population, while the previous
study evaluated a general Chinese popula-
tion; and (ii) the present study used polymer-
ase chain reaction­restriction fragment-
length polymorphism, while the previous
study utilized chip-based matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry for genotypic analysis.
Furthermore, another study reported that the
2184A/G polymorphism in the AGER gene
was associated with diabetes-associated
microvascular dermatoses in patients with
T2DM.20 This finding and that of the present
study suggest that there is heterogeneity in
the genetic susceptibility to diabetes-asso-
ciated microvascular complications among
different organs.
The present study had some limitations.
First, it did not measure the serum levels of
RAGE protein, so it was not able to deter-
mine if the serum levels of RAGE protein
changed concomitantly with the presence of
the 2184A/G polymorphism in the AGER
gene. Secondly, because of the limited sample
size, it was not possible to classify the patients
with DR into non-proliferative retinopathy
and proliferative retinopathy for further
subgroup investigations. Thirdly, as this

was a cross-sectional study, it was not pos-
sible to investigate the progression of DR.
Further prospective studies are necessary to
confirm the association between the 2184A/G
polymorphism in the AGER gene and the
serum levels of RAGE protein with the
presence of DR in patients with T2DM.
In conclusion, the findings of this present
study suggest that the 2184A/G polymorph-
ism in the AGER gene is not associated
with diabetic retinopathy in Han Chinese
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
