Background. Drug-related adverse events are an underappreciated consequence of antibiotic use, and the
national magnitude and scope of these events have not been studied. Our objective was to estimate and compare
the numbers and rates of emergency department (ED) visits for drug-related adverse events associated with systemic
antibiotics in the United States by drug class, individual drug, and event type.
Methods. We analyzed drug-related adverse events from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System­
Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project (2004­2006) and outpatient prescriptions from national
sample surveys of ambulatory care practices, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2004­2005).
Results. On the basis of 6614 cases, an estimated 142,505 visits (95% confidence interval [CI], 116,506­168,504
visits) annually were made to US EDs for drug-related adverse events attributable to systemic antibiotics. Antibiotics
were implicated in 19.3% of all ED visits for drug-related adverse events. Most ED visits for antibiotic-associated
adverse events were for allergic reactions (78.7% of visits; 95% CI, 75.3%­82.1% of visits). One-half of the estimated
ED visits were attributable to penicillins (36.9% of visits; 95% CI, 34.7%­39.2% of visits) and cephalosporins
(12.2%; 95% CI, 10.9%­13.5%). Among commonly prescribed antibiotics, sulfonamides and clindamycin were
associated with the highest rate of ED visits (18.9 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits [95% CI,
13.1­24.7 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits] and 18.5 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription
visits [95% CI, 12.1­25.0 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits], respectively). Compared with all
other antibiotic classes, sulfonamides were associated with a significantly higher rate of moderate-to-severe allergic
reactions (4.3% [95% CI, 2.9%­5.8%] vs. 1.9 % [95% CI, 1.5%­2.3%]), and sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones
were associated with a significantly higher rate of neurologic or psychiatric disturbances (1.4% [95% CI, 1.0%­
1.7%] vs. 0.5% [95% CI, 0.4%­0.6%]).
Conclusions. Antibiotic-associated adverse events lead to many ED visits, and allergic reactions are the most
common events. Minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use by even a small percentage could significantly reduce the
immediate and direct risks of drug-related adverse events in individual patients.
Antibiotics are among the most frequently used med-
ications in the United States. Annually, antibiotics are
prescribed to an estimated 16% of patients during am-
bulatory care visits [1], and pharmaceutical manufac-
turers spend 1$1 billion promoting antibiotics [2]. An-

tibiotic resistance resulting from excessive and
injudicious use of antibiotics is perceived to be a serious
threat to public health [3­5]. Consequently, efforts to
promote judicious antibiotic use have focused largely
on the long-term societal impact of antibiotic resistance
[5­7]. The more immediate risks of antibiotic use in
the community--namely, adverse effects--are generally
considered to be infrequent and mild. National cam-
paigns and communication strategies aimed at reducing
inappropriate antibiotic use have not traditionally in-
corporated messages that address these more direct and
short-term risks of antibiotic use [8, 9]. To better char-
acterize the scope and burden of serious antibiotic-
associated adverse events, we used nationally represen-
tative surveillance data from the United States to
736 · CID 2008:47 (15 September) · Shehab et al.
describe the frequency, rate, and nature of emergency depart-
ment (ED) visits for adverse events caused by systemic
antibiotics.
METHODS
National estimates of the number of ED visits for drug-related
adverse events were based on data from the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System­Cooperative Adverse Drug Event
Surveillance (NEISS-CADES) project, a national stratified prob-
ability sample of 63 hospitals with a minimum of 6 beds and
a 24-h ED in the United States and its territories [10­12]. The
NEISS-CADES project, which has been described in detail else-
where, is a joint effort of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, and
the US Food and Drug Administration [11, 12]. In brief, trained
coders located at each participating hospital review clinical re-
cords of every ED visit to identify physician-diagnosed drug-
related adverse events, to report up to 2 medications implicated
in each adverse event, and to record narrative descriptions of
the incident. We defined a drug-related adverse event as an
incident ED visit by a patient from 1 January 2004 through 31
December 2006 for a condition that the treating physician ex-
plicitly attributed to the use of an antibiotic or for an antibiotic-
specific adverse effect. Topical antibiotics (i.e., dermatologic,
ophthalmic, otic, or vaginal formulations) were excluded. Ad-
verse events were categorized as adverse effects (defined as un-
desirable pharmacologic or idiosyncratic effects, such as diar-
rhea, dizziness, and headache, while a patient was receiving
therapy at recommended doses), allergic reactions (defined as
immunologically mediated effects, such as rash and anaphy-
laxis), unintentional overdoses (defined as toxic effects asso-
ciated with excess dose, such as effects attributable to uninten-
tionally ingesting more than the prescribed dose), unintentional
exposures (defined as unintentional ingestion of a medication,
such as a child finding and ingesting an antibiotic), and other
effects (defined as adverse events not attributable to allergic
reactions, adverse effects, or unintentional overdoses, such as
injection site reactions and choking). On the basis of the di-
agnoses and symptoms provided for each case and with use of
methods described elsewhere [12], the manifestations associ-
ated with each adverse event were categorized into various con-
ditions. For simplification of presentation, adverse event con-
ditions were assigned in mutually exclusive and hierarchical
fashion.
National estimates of the number of outpatient prescription
visits (i.e., ambulatory care visits during which an antibiotic
was prescribed) were based on the National Ambulatory Med-
ical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Am-
bulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) [13­16]. The
NAMCS and NHAMCS are national sample surveys that pro-
vide information about the provision and use of ambulatory
medical care services, including physician office, hospital out-
patient department, and ED visits, in the United States and
have been used previously for estimates of the frequency of
antibiotic prescribing [17­20]. We used public-use data from
the period 2004­2005 (the most recent years available) to iden-
tify ambulatory care visits at which treatment with a systemic
antibiotic was either started or continued by using a combi-
nation of the 4-digit National Drug Code Directory class, brand
name, generic name (for single-ingredient drug products), and
individual active ingredients (for multi-ingredient drug prod-
ucts). We estimated the number of outpatient prescription visits
from NAMCS and NHAMCS for all systemic antibiotics that
were implicated in an ED visit for a drug-related adverse event
in the NEISS-CADES project from 2004 through 2006.
Each NEISS-CADES, NAMCS, and NHAMCS visit was as-
signed a sample weight on the basis of the inverse probability
of selection, adjusted for nonresponse, population changes, and
in NAMCS and NHAMCS, weight smoothing (i.e., adjustments
for extremes in final weights of visits) [10, 21, 22]. We calculated
national estimates of the frequency of ED and prescription visits
and corresponding 95% CIs using the Surveymeans procedure
in SAS, version 9.1 (SAS), to account for the sample weights
and complex sample designs. We divided frequency estimates
and 95% CIs by 3 for the period 2004­2006 (NEISS-CADES)
and by 2 for the period 2004­2005 (NAMCS, NHAMCS), to
obtain annual estimated frequencies. Estimates based on small
numbers of cases (!20 cases for NEISS-CADES and !30 cases
for NAMCS and NHAMCS) or with a coefficient of variation
130% were considered to be statistically unstable and are not
presented here.
We calculated rates by dividing the estimated number of ED
visits for drug-related adverse events (from NEISS-CADES) by
the estimated number of outpatient visits at which that anti-
biotic or antibiotic class was prescribed (from NAMCS and
NHAMCS). The 95% CI for each rate incorporated variance
estimates for both numerator and denominator components
of the corresponding rate estimate [23]. Because these com-
ponents were calculated from separate surveillance systems,
they were treated as independent and as having zero covariance
[23].
RESULTS
On the basis of 6614 cases, an estimated 142,505 ED visits (95%
CI, 116,506-168,504 visits) annually occurred because of an-
tibiotic-associated adverse events from 2004 through 2006 (ta-
ble 1). Systemic antibiotics were implicated in 19.3% of all ED
visits for drug-related adverse events. Persons aged 15­44 years
accounted for an estimated 41.2% of ED visits. Infants (age,
!1 year) accounted for only an estimated 6.3% of ED visits;
however, after accounting for prescription frequency, the es-
timated rate of ED visits for adverse events attributable to an-

a Adverse effects refer to undesirable pharmacologic or idiosyncratic effects that occur while the patient is
receiving therapy at recommended doses (e.g., diarrhea, dizziness, and headache); allergic reactions refer to
immunologically mediated effects (e.g., rash and anaphylaxis); unintentional overdoses refer to toxic effects linked
to excess dose (e.g., because of unintentionally ingesting more than the prescribed dose); unintentional exposures
(e.g., unintentional ingestion of a medication, such as a child finding and ingesting an antibiotic); and other effects
refer to adverse events not associated with allergic reactions, adverse effects, or unintentional overdoses (e.g.,
injection site reactions and choking).
tibiotics was highest in this age group (15.9 ED visits per 10,000
outpatient prescription visits; 95% CI, 10.6­21.1 ED visits per
10,000 outpatient prescription visits). More than two-thirds of
estimated ED visits for antibiotic-associated adverse events were
by female patients, and the estimated rate of ED visits was
significantly higher among female patients than among male
patients (12.5 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits
[95% CI, 9.9­15.1 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription
visits] vs. 7.9 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits
[95% CI, 6.3­9.5 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription
visits]). An estimated 78.7% of drug-related adverse events were
attributed to allergic reactions; 6.1% of drug-related adverse
events led to hospitalization.
Together, penicillins and cephalosporins were implicated in
one-half of the estimated ED visits for antibiotic-associated
adverse events (36.9% and 12.2% of visits, respectively) (table
2). Among antibiotics commonly used in the community, the
estimated rates of ED visits for drug-related adverse events were

visits are based on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(2004­2005). Individual drugs are shown in the table only if they were implicated in 0.5% of estimated emergency
department visits for antibiotic-associated adverse events. For example, cefaclor was counted under cephalosporins but
was implicated in only 18 patients (estimated percentage of ED visits, 0.4% ) and, therefore, is not shown.
a Penicillin includes penicillin V and penicillin G salts.

c Sulfonamides include sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulfisoxazole, and sulfisoxazole-erythromycin.
d For ED visits for adverse events, "other" antibiotics include imipenem-cilastatin (3 cases), ertapenem (1 case),
gentamicin (3 cases), tobramycin (1 case), and daptomycin (1 case). For outpatient prescription visits, "other" antibiotics
include carbapenems, aminoglycosides (excluding neomycin sulfate), and daptomycin.

highest for sulfonamides (18.9 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient
prescription visits) and clindamycin (18.5 ED visits per 10,000
outpatient prescription visits). Within most antibiotic classes,
the rates of ED visits for adverse events attributable to indi-
vidual drugs were similar. However, the rate of ED visits for
adverse events attributable to amoxicillin or penicillin was sig-
nificantly higher than that for adverse events attributable to
amoxicillin-clavulanate (15.5 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient
prescription visits [95% CI, 12.3­18.7 ED visits per 10,000
outpatient prescription visits] vs. 7.8 ED visits per 10,000 out-
patient prescription visits [95% CI, 5.5­10.2 ED visits per
10,000 outpatient prescription visits]), and the rate of ED visits
for adverse events attributable to moxifloxacin was significantly
higher than that for adverse events attributable to any other
fluoroquinolone (table 2). Overall, the rate of ED visits for
antibiotic-associated adverse events was 10.5 ED visits per
10,000 outpatient prescription visits (95% CI, 8.3­12.6 ED visits
per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits).
Among ED visits for adverse events attributed only to 1
antibiotic or 2 antibiotics from the same class, the most com-
mon drug-related adverse event conditions were allergic reac-
tions (table 3). Sulfonamides were associated with a significantly
higher rate of moderate-to-severe allergic reactions, compared
with all other antibiotic classes combined (4.3% [95% CI,
2.9%­5.8%] vs. 1.9% [95% CI, 1.5%­2.3%]). The rate of mild
allergic reactions was significantly higher with penicillins, sul-
fonamides, and clindamycin than with all other antibiotic clas-
ses combined (7.8% [95% CI, 6.2%­9.3%] vs. 2.8% [95% CI,
2.2%­3.4%]). The rate of gastrointestinal disturbances was
highest with clindamycin (3.0%; 95% CI, 1.5%­4.6%), but this
rate was not significantly different from the rate with all other
antibiotic classes. Sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were as-
sociated with significantly higher rates of neurologic or psy-
chiatric effects than were all other antibiotic classes combined
(1.4% [95% CI, 1.0%­1.7%] vs. 0.5% [95% CI, 0.4%­0.6%]).
Sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones were also associated with
the highest rates of hospitalization (1.0% [95% CI, 0.5%­1.6%]
and 0.9% [95% CI, 0.5%­1.2%]), but rates of hospitalization
were not significantly different among classes.
DISCUSSION
This investigation was the first that we are aware of to use
timely, nationally representative surveillance data to estimate
and compare the numbers and rates of adverse events attrib-
utable to systemic antibiotics by drug class, individual drug,
and event type. We estimated that adverse events attributable
to antibiotics caused 1142,000 ED visits per year, and nearly
four-fifths of these events were allergic reactions. The overall
rate of ED visits for antibiotic-associated adverse events (10.5
ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits) was higher
than expected. The rate of ED visits for antibiotic-associated
adverse events is one-half of the rate of ED visits for adverse
events attributable to "high-risk" medications, such as warfarin,
insulin, and digoxin (20.6 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient pre-
scription visits); however, the rate of ED visits for antibiotic-
associated adverse events is 3 times higher than that for adverse
events attributable to some anticoagulant and antiplatelet
agents (e.g., aspirin and clopidogrel), oral hypoglycemics (e.g.,
metformin), and some narrow therapeutic index agents (e.g.,
phenytoin and lithium; rate for all of these drug classes com-
bined, 3.3 ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits)
[24].
Previous studies using NAMCS, NHAMCS, and NEISS-
CADES data have estimated that antibiotics cause 19% of
ambulatory care visits [25] and 18% of ED visits [12] for drug-
related adverse events. However, these studies did not provide
detailed comparisons among antibiotic classes and drugs, ac-
count for antibiotic prescribing frequency, or describe the na-
ture of antibiotic-associated adverse events. More-detailed stud-
ies of antibiotic-associated adverse events have been largely
limited to studies involving hospitalized patients, spontaneous
reports of adverse drug reactions attributable to a single an-
tibiotic or antibiotic class, or studies of specific adverse events
[26­30].
We found that nearly 80% of ED visits for antibiotic-asso-
ciated adverse events among patients receiving ambulatory care
were the result of allergic reactions. This finding is in contrast
to those for other medication classes that cause many ED visits
for drug-related adverse events (e.g., anticoagulants, antidi-
abetics, and anticonvulsants), which primarily result from med-
ication errors and overdoses [12, 24]. Although medication
errors and overdoses can be prevented by improving admin-
istration and monitoring, most allergic reactions can only be
prevented by avoiding exposure to a drug. We could not assess
the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing from these data;
however, more than one-half of the estimated 100 million an-
tibiotic prescriptions written in the community each year for
respiratory tract infections may be unnecessary [17, 18, 31].
Although the risk of an ED visit for an antibiotic-associated
adverse event is small for an individual patient, when antibiotics
are commonly prescribed for indications for which they have
no benefit, the burden of preventable adverse events in the
population is great. Thus, efforts to mitigate the burden of
untoward effects of antibiotics should focus on minimizing
excessive use of antibiotics, because decreasing inappropriate
antibiotic use by even a small percentage could substantially
reduce the number of patients who experience antibiotic-as-
sociated adverse events.
Previous studies have found that, when both infectious dis-
eases specialists and general physicians prescribe broad-spec-
trum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, they often cite per-
ceived advantages of these agents in terms of their safety profiles

NOTE. Estimates of the number of adverse events are based on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System­Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project (2004­2006). Estimates
of the number of outpatient prescription visits (OPV) are based on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2004­2005). Adverse events
were categorized into 1 condition. Adverse event conditions are mutually exclusive and were assigned hierarchically (left to right). For example, a case in which a patient experienced both a severe
allergic reaction and gastrointestinal effects would be categorized as a moderate-to-severe allergic reaction.
a Only cases in which drugs from a single systemic antibiotic class were implicated in the adverse event are included (5802 cases). Estimates with coefficient of variation 130% or based on !20
cases were not calculated.
b Includes anaphylaxis, angioedema, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, facial-pharyngeal-genital edema, hypersensitivity vasculitis, red man syndrome, respiratory distress or arrest, serum
sickness, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
c Includes dermatitis, drug eruption, erythema, flushing, localized edema, pruritus, rash, rash morbilliform, and urticaria.
d Includes metronidazole, nitrofurans, vancomycin, linezolid, unspecified, and other antibiotic classes.

[32, 33]. Although the rate of ED visits for adverse events
attributable to fluoroquinolones was lower than the rates of
ED visits for adverse events attributable to sulfonamides and
clindamycin, it was higher than the rates of ED visits for adverse
events attributable to cephalosporins, macrolides, and tetra-
cyclines. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with the
second highest rates of neurologic or psychiatric effects and
hospitalization. The significantly higher rate of adverse events
attributable to moxifloxacin, compared with fluoroquinolones,
is similar to findings from clinical trials and studies based on
spontaneous reporting [28, 34] and is contrary to the percep-
tion that "newer" antibiotics have superior adverse effect pro-
files [32, 33].
Adverse event data cannot be used in isolation to dictate the
decision as to whether to prescribe antibiotics or to determine
optimal antibiotic selection for individual patients. However,
these national surveillance data can be used by clinicians to
help assess the validity of their perceptions of the safety profile
of various antibiotics and antibiotic classes. These population-
based findings are also important, because adverse event data
from spontaneous reports cannot provide population rates, and
safety data from clinical trials largely reflect adverse events
among a small number of highly selected persons relative to
those eventually exposed to antibiotics in the community [35].
The infectious diseases and public health communities have
long argued for judicious antibiotic use by physicians because
of the lack of effectiveness for treating certain conditions (e.g.,
upper respiratory tract infection caused by a virus) and the
threat of antibiotic resistance [5­9]. Nevertheless, unnecessary
prescribing of antibiotics in the community remains common
[18, 19, 36­38]. In qualitative studies of antibiotic prescribing
practices, physicians reported difficulty with communicating
information on antibiotic effectiveness and resistance and ex-
pressed concerns about the time required for such explanations
[39, 40]. Physicians often perceived antibiotic resistance as a
societal problem, identified the interests of their individual pa-
tients as being more important, and prescribed antibiotics to
patients who they believed expected to receive antibiotics [32,
33, 39­41]. National data quantifying the risks of clinically
relevant antibiotic-associated adverse events (i.e., those result-
ing in ED visits) can support a simpler argument for using
antibiotics judiciously and one that directly addresses the in-
dividual patient and the physician's primary responsibility, pri-
mum non nocere, first do no harm.
National antibiotic-associated adverse event data can also be
used by campaigns targeted at changing patient expectations
of antibiotic therapy. In studies that assessed patients' percep-
tions of the harmful consequences of antibiotic use, the as-
sociation between antibiotics and adverse effects (e.g., rash)
was almost always mentioned, but the association between an-
tibiotics and resistance was rarely mentioned [39]. Similar re-
search has demonstrated that patients frequently do not un-
derstand that antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections
[42]. Thus, communicating the risk of serious antibiotic-
associated adverse events to patients can add to their existing
perceptions of risks of antibiotic therapy and may reduce the
amount of requests for antibiotic therapy more than by trying
to convey information on antibiotic effectiveness or resistance
alone [32, 33, 39, 40]. Because one-quarter of all estimated ED
visits for antibiotic-associated adverse events (37,000 visits)
were by children aged !15 years and the highest rate of ED
visits was among infants, this message could be targeted at
parents of pediatric patients, in particular.
Antibiotic use guidelines are beginning to recognize that the
risk of adverse effects in individual patients can outweigh the
benefits of antibiotics for certain prophylactic indications. Re-
cently, infective endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines were re-
vised, at least in part, on the basis of the assessment that the
risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events exceeds the benefits
of prophylactic use for many patients [43, 44]. Future antibiotic
use guidelines should incorporate the best available evidence
on risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events in individual
patients in ways that can be integrated in clinical practice [32,
35, 40].
This investigation focused on drug-related adverse events
diagnosed in EDs, and thus, the numbers and rates do not
reflect all antibiotic-associated adverse events. Although our
data describe clinically relevant drug-related adverse events that
warranted medical attention and contributed to health care
resource use, we could not account for unreported events and
events identified in other health care settings, such as physi-
cians' offices. Because case identification in the NEISS-CADES
project relies on the presence of a physician-diagnosed drug-
related adverse event in the ED, rare and less well-recognized
events and events with subacute onset are less likely to be
captured. We limited our analysis of drug-related adverse event
conditions and outcomes (table 3) to cases in which only drugs
from a single antibiotic class were implicated in the adverse
event, to describe only the events that were attributed to an-
tibiotics and not to other types of drugs. In doing so, we may
have neglected to describe certain adverse events, such as those
resulting from drug-drug interactions (e.g., hemorrhage in a
patient receiving warfarin and a fluoroquinolone) [45]. Phy-
sicians may also be more likely to recognize certain adverse
event conditions associated with a particular antibiotic class
than those associated with other classes (e.g., they are more
likely to identify allergic reactions associated with b-lactam an-
tibiotics than allergic reactions associated with fluoroquino-
lones), thus influencing the spectrum of adverse events de-
scribed in association with each antibiotic class. Similar to most
previous studies on antibiotic prescribing [17­20], we used
NAMCS and NHAMCS for estimates of the frequency of out-
742 · CID 2008:47 (15 September) · Shehab et al.
patient antibiotic prescribing. Our estimates of the frequency
of outpatient antibiotic prescribing are similar to those pre-
viously reported using NAMCS and NHAMCS [1, 20]. How-
ever, different prescription databases may have yielded different
estimates of the frequency of outpatient antibiotic prescribing
[46], and the frequency of outpatient antibiotic prescribing,
when based on NAMCS and NHAMCS, is likely to be under-
estimated, because these databases exclude telephone and e-
mail contacts, antibiotics prescribed in nursing homes or am-
bulatory surgery centers, and antibiotic courses initiated during
hospitalization or provided at hospital discharge.
Antibiotic-associated adverse events lead to many ED visits,
and allergic reactions are the most common events. Commu-
nicating the risks of antibiotic-associated adverse events can
become an important strategy in efforts to promote judicious
antibiotic use. Avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use reduces not
only the public health threat of antibiotic resistance but also
the risk of drug-related adverse events in individual patients.
