Abstract
In response to the five commentaries on our paper `Comparative approaches to gentrification: lessons from
the rural', we open up more `windows' on rural gentrification and its urban counterpart. First, we highlight
the issues of metrocentricity and urbanormativity within gentrification studies, highlighting their employ-
ment by our commentators. Second, we consider the issue of displacement and its operation within rural
space, as well as gentrification as a coping strategy for neoliberal existence and connections to more-than-
human natures. Finally, we consider questions of scale, highlighting the need to avoid naturalistic concep-
tions of scale and arguing that attention could be paid to the role of material practices, symbolizations and
lived experiences in producing scaled geographies of rural and urban gentrification.
Keywords
comparative ruralism, displacement, rural gentrification, rurality, scale, urbanity
Introduction
Our article aimed to stimulate discussion of how
framings other than the urban might contribute to
comparative studies of gentrification, as well as
considering the impact of comparative research on
conceptualizations of gentrification. Our interlocu-
tors provide positive commentary, noting we have
opened a `window into a wider (than English speak-
ing) world' (Bernt, 2018: 2) as well as making crit-
ical points. Here, we respond to these latter
comments, through clarifying our original argu-
ments and using the comments to develop some
further arguments, which we have structured around
three themes.
Rurality and urbanity
The two urban scholars raise questions about the
significance of our paper for studies of urban gen-
trification, suggesting that we failed to produce
`much lessons' for this research (Bernt, 2018: 3),
and questioning whether conceptualizations of rural
gentrification `nurture important ongoing debates
related to the expansion of cities and urbanization

processes' (Lo
´pez-Morales, 2018: 4). Bernt further
argues that we `play it too safe' and fail to `make use
of the ammunition collected' to `directly name'
what we view as `false projections and misled con-
ceptualisations'. While rather sceptical that such
language creates the `fresh atmosphere' that Bernt
desires, we begin this response by reiterating that a
key argument of our article was that gentrification
studies have tended to employ a `metropolitan cen-
tricity', not only through privileging a narrow range
of cities in the Global North but also through setting
up the urban as a privileged viewpoint through
which to interpret the world.
Thomas et al.'s (2011) concept of `urbanorma-
tivity' is useful in elaborating this argument, as it
refers to the practice of taking urban space, or, par-
ticular subsets of it, as constituting the `normal'
space of operation of social processes, while alter-
native locations are `othered' as spaces of absence
or abnormality. Such arguments can be applied to
gentrification studies, where a range of `other geo-
graphies of gentrification' (Phillips, 2004) have
been identified. Moreover, we would argue that the
commentaries of Bernt, Lo
´pez-Morales and Nelson
provide enactments of metrocentricity/urbanorma-
tivity. Bernt, for example, appears to identify New
Age professionals as an urban phenomenon, an
argument that neglects the significance of rurality
in many forms of `new-ageism' (e.g. Chevalier,
1981; Halfacree, 1995). More generally, Bernt
(2018: 4) suggests that rural changes should be con-
ceptualized as `part of the re-configuration of the
urban', a viewpoint that gives no scope for agency
to emerge from within rural areas. Nelson also
seems to view rural gentrification as a process ori-
ginating in the urban, albeit one that has moved
down the urban hierarchy into rural locations in
countries such as the United Kingdom and United
States, a diffusionist claim we explicitly contested
in our article, both empirically for its neglect of sites
of rural gentrification dated soon after coinage of
the term by Glass (1964) and more theoretically
through the concept of genetic comparisons.
Lo
´pez-Morales develops very similar claims to
Bernt and Nelson, drawing explicitly on the notion
of planetary urbanization that has informed his work
(Lees et al., 2016; Lo
´pez-Morales et al., 2016), to
suggest that rural/urban divisions may not make
sense `in a world where everything is essentially
urban' (Lo
´pez-Morales, 2018: 4). Both Lo
´pez-
Morales and ourselves make reference to the work
of Brenner and Schmidt, although we do as an illus-
tration of how the urban is often elevated to a privi-
leged position. While there is value in their work,
we agree with Walker's (2015: 188) argument that
planetary urbanization `effectively erase the rural'
via constructing spaces that may be identified as
`rural' as completely entwined with the dynamics
of urbanization, a perspective which he claims is
problematic as `the rural "Other" has not been fully
internalized by the urban' (see also Roy, 2016).
Walker adds that recognizing rural otherness
does not imply such spaces are disconnected from
the urban, but rather that the presence of relational
connections does not reduce localities to urbanity.
Such arguments have a long history in rural studies,
where there have not only been repeated calls to
recognize encompassing relations with urban spaces
(e.g. Cloke, 1989; Hoggart, 1990) but also recurrent
arguments about the need to recognize the specifi-
cities of rural spaces and places. Here, connections
can be made to Hines' (2018) favouring of particu-
larist ethnographies, although his desire to identify
recurrent stories invokes universalistic or generic
elements. Reference might also have been made to
calls for multisite or global ethnographies (Marcus
1995; Burawoy 2001), which enact relational com-
parisons. Comparative strategies, hence, cannot be
equated to the adoption of particular methodologies.
Lo
´pez-Morales' (2018: 4) comment that our
paper exhibited a `lack of sensitiveness regarding
the challenging different geographies and analytical
categories a properly comparative reflection should
present' also raises questions concerning the con-
duct of comparative research. His assessment seems
to be based on a privileging of North­South com-
parisons over all other comparisons. We were there-
fore heartened by Bernt's (2018: 2) assessment that
our paper `productively demonstrate that a North­
South binary which has become customary in much
of the urban studies world is neither necessary, nor
sufficient for making comparison work as a strat-
egy'. This is not to say that North­South compar-
isons are unimportant, with rural scholars asking
52 Dialogues in Human Geography 8(1)
many of the same questions that Lo
´pez-Morales
raises concerning the applicability of conceptions
of space and transformation produced in the Global
North to the Global South (e.g. Korf and Oughton
2006; Murray 2008). We would argue that there is a
need for a `comparative ruralism' that, like its urban
counterpart, extends its focus across the Global
North and South, although would also point to the
significance of other forms of spatial differentiation.
Lo
´pez-Morales himself has raised the issue of
regional differentiation in his discussions of `Latin
American gentrification' (Lo
´pez-Morales et al.,
2016) and the `Global East' (Shin et al., 2016).
There is research on rural gentrification in each of
these contexts (e.g. Jokisch, 2002; Qian et al., 2013),
and we ourselves are exploring gentrification in the
context of the Global East (Phillips, 2016; Smith,
2017). Having said this, we would suggest that there
is value and challenge in comparisons even within
the Global North, not least in relation to the issue of
language raised by Gkartzios (2013) and discussed
by Halfacree (2018).
Halfacree's commentary also provides an illus-
tration of how arguments over rural specificity may
be enacted within gentrification studies, remarking
that a simple appropriation of gentrification from
urban studies might be viewed as a `colonizing'
attitude towards the rural. As we noted in our article,
many studies of rural gentrification include caution-
ary remarks about direct transfer of the concept of
gentrification from urban to rural contexts. We sus-
pect that many rural scholars refrain from employ-
ing the concept because of its perceived connections
to urban space.
Halfacree also argued that rural population
change needed to have been mapped before
researchers began to engage with the concept of
rural gentrification. This is an interesting claim, par-
ticularly given Nelson et al.'s (2010) view that there
is `scant understanding of the extent of rural gentri-
fication at a more macroscale'. We would, however,
argue that mapping is itself conditioned concep-
tually, and, hence, by the associated circulatory
sociologies of translation. We would also point to
references to rural gentrification prior to the study of
Phillips (1993) (e.g. Cloke, 1979; Parsons, 1980;
Fitchen, 1991) as well as the `feet on the ground'
recognition of `class-based "up-scaling"' made
without reference to gentrification outlined by Half-
acree (2018: 2). For us, it is important to not only
recognize the presence of rural gentrification where
the term is not employed but also consider reasons
as to why the term was not employed.
Rural gentrification and questions of
displacement
Halfacree provides arguments as to why the term
might have been resisted by rural researchers, sug-
gesting that reservations might stem from uncertain-
ties relating to the presence of displacement as well
as the concept's perceived connections to urban
space discussed above, and the postmodern and cul-
tural turns discussed in our paper. Specifically,
Halfacree argues that working class displacement
preceded the arrival of middle class residents, and
hence these were not causally related as implied in
gentrification. These are important issues to con-
sider and Halfacree may well be right to signal these
as possible barriers to the incorporation of gentrifi-
cation into rural studies.
Displacement has, indeed, been a facet of gentri-
fication that has been rather neglected within rural
studies, despite claims as to its critical significance
to the overall concept of gentrification (Slater, 2006,
2008). Having said this, it is important to note that
the points Halfacree makes could be seen to have
relevance to both urban and rural space and, hence,
arguably do little to explain differences between
urban and rural scholars. Many accounts of urban
gentrification, for instance, have pointed to the
abandonment of areas prior to gentrification, with
Marcuse (1985) providing an insightful discussion
of the extent of abandonment in New York and its
relationship to gentrification and displacement. In
line with Halfacree's (2018: 4) remarks about the
need to situate discussions of demographic change
within a wider framing of `ongoing renewal of class
polarisation within society as a whole', Marcuse
presents abandonment and gentrification as distinct
manifestations of class restructuring, whereby there
was a decline in working class employment oppor-
tunities and associated effective demand for hous-
ing, which led to property abandonment in some
Phillips and Smith 53
neighbourhoods, alongside growth of professional
service employment that led to demands for office
development and gentrified properties. While Half-
acree points to the presence of a different, and in
many instances, earlier phase of restructuring linked
to reductions in agricultural work, Marcuse high-
lights how gentrification may occur alongside aban-
donment and, indeed, may involve replacement in
areas that have been abandoned. As discussed in
Phillips (2005), abandonment can be seen as one
way that spaces are `made ready for gentrification',
not least because it indicates the devalorization of
properties that can constitute the emergence of a
rent gap that comes to be closed through
gentrification.
Marcuse also discusses how displacement may
occur in a range of forms. We feel this discussion
might be of value to rural studies, pointing to how
displacement may operate both over time and in far
from direct ways. Marcuse, for instance, notes how
residents can be displaced quite immediately and
directly, through combinations of physical force,
material neglect and economic pricing ­ or what
he identifies as `direct last-resident displacement'
(Marcuse, 1985: 206). Work on the cessation of tied
housing (e.g. Newby, 1977; Bowler and Lewis,
1987) as well as the outbidding of `local people'
in housing markets (e.g. Shucksmith, 1991; Liu and
Roberts, 2013) might be viewed as illustrative of the
presence of this form of displacement. Marcuse
adds, however, that displacement can occur across
a series of residents, with several residents leaving
prior to the departure of the final non-gentrifier resi-
dent. Such a concept has not, to our knowledge,
been applied to rural gentrification but would seem
to be of potential relevance. Cloke et al. (1995), for
instance, make reference to people accessing rural
areas through `marginalised channels of entry'
including staying with family and friends (see also
Cloke et al., 2000), and many of these `rural resi-
dents' appear likely to move away from these places
of residence and hence could be viewed as dis-
placed. There is also clear evidence that some off-
spring of contemporary rural residents are unable to
access housing in these localities and move away in
search of affordable homes. Hence, while in many
villages, there may currently be a continuing
`working-class' presence, this may not continue into
the future. This connects to a third form of displace-
ment identified by Marcuse (1985: 206), namely,
`exclusionary displacement', focused on how the
gentrification of properties prevents replacement
of non-gentrifier households by other non-
gentrifier households. There may even in some
instances not be any direct displacement, but there
is exclusion of certain forms of in-migration, a
description that might be applicable not only to the
`re-filled emptied' rural space of Halfacree's com-
mentary but also to the brownfield sites of urban
new-build gentrification, where authors such as
Davidson and Lees (2005, 2010) have explicitly
employed Marcuse's notion of exclusionary gentri-
fication as well as his fourth form of displacement,
`displacement pressure'. This relates to the chang-
ing character of places and how this can result in a
location becoming `less and less liveable' (Marcuse,
1985: 206) for a group of existing residents. This
declining liveability may be quite material in form,
such as, for instance, when the loss of bus services
prevents rural residents accessing work, retail or
welfare services. It also takes more experiential and
affective dimensions, whereby people come to feel
that they do not belong to a place.
We feel that a series of `new windows' between
urban and rural studies could be opened-up through
these notions of displacement. The notion of `dis-
placement pressure' quite directly connects to the
ethnographic perspective outlined by Hines (2018),
which, in turn, exhibits parallels to Halfacree's
(2018: 4) call for gentrification to be viewed as a
`coping strategy' to deal with contemporary `neo-
liberal existence', albeit conjoined with recognition
of their impacts on other people, a call that has
strong resonances with the work of Schlichtman
et al. (2017). The concept of displacement pressure
also highlights how displacement does not necessa-
rily involve movement of people, an argument that
could be considered in relation to the literature on
both `new-build' and `green'/`ecological'/`low-car-
bon' gentrification. The latter forms of gentrifica-
tion are mentioned by Bernt in relation to
elaborating an argument about a blurring of rural
and urban spatial distinctions, although his argu-
ment in our view reduces rurality to a space of
54 Dialogues in Human Geography 8(1)
nature. While we have both argued that notions of
nature and the natural may be important constituents
of symbolizations and senses of rurality (Phillips
et al., 2008; Smith and Phillips, 2001), both nature
and rurality are complexly and variously con-
structed and apprehended (Phillips, 2014). Just as
we have argued that attention could usefully be
paid to the significance of different rural land-
scapes in processes of gentrification (Phillips and
Smith, 2018: 20; see also Smith et al., 2018), so we
would argue that the presence and differences in
`more-than-human' natures or environments need
to be recognized. The restored natures of formerly
polluted `brownfield' sites exhibit differences, as
well as similarities, with the natures of public
parks, intensive agriculture and wilderness, and
these are probably poorly served by dualistic con-
structions of rurality and urbanity. Furthermore, as
argued in Phillips (2010b: 51), if arguments over
displacement are extended to include the more-
than-human, even new-build developments of land
not previously used for residential use could be
viewed as creating displacement, of both direct and
in-direct kinds, in that spaces are rarely uninhab-
ited by `plants, animals and other forms of biodi-
versity'. Such spaces of nature, as well as the
environments of buildings, are often the focus of
experiential and affective attachments and hence
can be the foci of `displacement pressure' linked
to the transformation of place, or as Davidson
(2009: 227) puts it, drawing on the work of Hei-
degger and Lefebvre, the `transformation of lived
space' (see also Phillips, 2002).
Scaled geographies of gentrification
Nelson (2018: 2) argues that a `sensitivity to scale
can expand our understandings of gentrification'.
Scale is, however, a highly contested concept, with
calls to both do away with the concept (Marston
et al., 2005) and reconceptualize it (Smith, 1992;
Howitt, 1998; Marston, 2000). In both cases, criti-
cisms are made about scale being `naturalized' as a
conceptual pregiven. We were, therefore, surprised
that Nelson's commentary contained little reflection
on the meaning and construction of scale, as well as
being uncertain about some claims made about the
employment of scale within gentrification studies.
For instance, there seems to be a suggestion that
Zukin (1989) and Ley (1996) both conduct their
analysis at the interurban scale of `a system of cities'
(Nelson, 2018: 3), although we would apply this
phrase only to the latter study. We would also ques-
tion Nelson's illustration of how scale can inform
understandings of the `geography of the concept of
rural gentrification', which implies that the presence
of studies of gentrification within London acted to
produce `heightened awareness' of gentrification in
the surrounding urban and rural areas, while in the
United States scholars preferred to make use of con-
cepts such as `"counterurbanization" or "amenity
migration"' (Nelson, 2018: 4­5). However, not only
have conceptions of counterurbanization been more
widely adopted in the United Kingdom than rural
gentrification (Phillips, 2010a), but early references
to rural gentrification emerged in areas of the United
Kingdom quite distant to London, such as Devon
and Warwickshire (Cloke, 1979), Nottinghamshire
(Parsons, 1980), and Gower, Wales (Phillips, 1993).
Likewise, the claim that studies of rural gentrifica-
tion in the United States had to travel greater dis-
tances from their urban centres might be questioned
both through reference to the work of Fitchen (1991)
in New York state and Frieberger (1996) in Texas,
and by asking why the concept of gentrification
seemingly travelled so strongly to spaces remote
from urban centres without being applied to spaces
more proximate to urban areas. More generally, we
would caution against too direct a reading of the
geography of rural gentrification from the geogra-
phy of rural gentrification scholarship.
There also seemed in Nelson's commentary to be
a sense that scale is constitutive of different senses
of rurality. This is a further interesting new `win-
dow' through which researchers might usefully
peer. Having said this, we are mindful of Brenner's
(2001) comments about the unreflective conflation
of conceptions of scale with concepts such as space
and place, and would argue that scale is not strongly
constitutive of all senses of rurality, and that in con-
sidering its significance, attention needs to be paid
as to how scale is being viewed.
Nelson's discussion of scale is, we would sug-
gest, very Cartesian in tone, making repeated
Phillips and Smith 55
references to measures of travel times and distances,
as well as settlement size. Such a sense of scale is
consistent with what Lefebvre (1991) has described
as `abstract space', which Dimendberg (1998: 24)
argues can be viewed as a representation of space in
which material spatial practices and lived spaces of
representation `recede in importance'. Much of the
critique of naturalized conceptions of scale has
focused on detailing the material practices and rela-
tions through which scales come to be socially con-
structed, and it may be that Nelson's discussion of
production-side and demand-side interpretations of
gentrification could connect to such perspectives.
Personally, we find the differentiation of interpreta-
tions into such sides overly dualistic and also do not
consider that particular forms of comparison are tied
to particular scales of analysis as Nelson seems to
imply. There are, however, scalar dimensions to the
remarks made in our paper about metrics within com-
parative studies that we should have highlighted:
many instances of gentrification may go unrecog-
nized because indicative material is obscured within
data sets constructed at a greater spatial scale than
gentrification is being realized at within a locality.
We would also argue that in any scaling of gen-
trification studies, attention needs to be paid to the
presence of a range of scalar representations, includ-
ing ones that that take less abstracted forms, and also
to lived experiences of scale. We have recently
made use of indices of low-population density and
low-connectivity to urban centres of employment to
identify areas of wilderness gentrification (Smith
et al., 2018), stressing that while these indices con-
nect to popular representations of wilderness as
places devoid both of the presence of and connec-
tions to centres of large scale human settlement,
these locations are symbolized in a range of ways
and people can find wilderness experiences in areas
relatively proximate in abstract space. Howitt's
(2002) argument that consideration of scale needs
to connect to studies of lived experiences would
seem to be of clear significance here, with a further
window of opportunity being to inject scale into
discussions of lived space and representations of
space that have emerged in gentrification studies
(e.g Phillips, 2002; Davidson, 2009; Davidson and
Lees, 2010).
Concluding comments
We have sought to open up more windows on rural
gentrification to bring, to borrow Bernt's phraseol-
ogy, some `fresh air' into this subject of study, and
its urban counterpart. Our first window highlighted
issues of metrocentricity and urbanormativity
within gentrification studies, as well as discussing
the spatial framings of comparative study and argu-
ing for the development of a comparative ruralism.
Through the second window, we examined displa-
cement and its operation within rural space as well
as considered gentrification as a coping strategy for
neoliberal existence and gentrification and more-
than-human natures. The final window related to
questions of scale, highlighting debates about the
significance and meaning of the concept of scale,
as well as considering the role of scale in the forma-
tion of rurality and gentrification. We thank our
interlocutors for their comments and stimulating
us to think about further areas of exploration.
