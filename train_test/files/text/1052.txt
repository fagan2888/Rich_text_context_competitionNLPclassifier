ABSTRACT The 1982­1994 National Long-Term Care
Surveys indicate an accelerating decline in disability among
the U.S. elderly population, suggesting that a 1.5% annual
decline in chronic disability for elderly persons is achievable.
Furthermore, many risk factors for chronic diseases show
improvements, many linked to education, from 1910 to the
present. Projections indicate the proportion of persons aged
85­89 with less than 8 years of education will decline from 65%
in 1980 to 15% in 2015. Health and socioeconomic status
trends are not directly represented in Medicare Trust Fund
and Social Security Administration beneficiary projections.
Thus, they may have different economic implications from
projections directly accounting for health trends. A 1.5%
annual disability decline keeps the support ratio (ratio of
economically active persons aged 20­64 to the number of
chronically disabled persons aged 65) above its 1994 value,
22:1, when the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was in fiscal
balance, to 2070. With no changes in disability, projections
indicate a support ratio in 2070 of 8:1--63% below a cash flow
balance.
The changing health status of the U.S. elderly population is
likely to, and should, have a substantial impact on the future
demand for health services. This, in turn, has major implica-
tions for the formulation of both public and private health
insurance programs, generally, and the future dynamics of
Medicare policy and legislation, in particular. Indeed, the
ongoing controversy and uncertainty about the long-term
solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and total Medicare costs
can be linked directly to the variation among projections about
the future distributions of chronic diseases and disability in a
rapidly growing U.S. elderly population.
Current Medicare Trust Fund and Social Security Admin-
istration (SSA) projections--despite their broad utiliza-
tion--do not explicitly incorporate population health trends
or, as a consequence, the possibility of cost savings accruing to
them. Furthermore, ongoing and likely future biotechnology
innovations, together with a wide range of primary prevention
and health-promoting programs (many of which are designed
using data and statistical information from biomedical and
epidemiological research) are playing, and will likely continue
to play, a major role in determining the number of disability-
free life years experienced by future U.S. elderly populations
(1­3). The efficacy of these technologically based curative and
preventive health strategies, and of an increasing number of
formal and informal behaviorallifestyle health maintenance
programs, is a result of the cumulation of products of a long
history of basic biomedical and epidemiological research of
chronic health problems in the U.S. (refs. 4­6; K.G.M. and
K. C. Land, unpublished results). Nevertheless, these features,
which are core ingredients in determining the future demand
for health services, and correlatively the fiscal basis and
actuarial soundness of public and private health insurance and
pension programs lie outside of the forecasting methodology
that currently is used to help formulate Medicare legislation
and financing.
The purpose of this paper is to present alternative projec-
tions to those currently put forth by SSA and the Medicare
Trustees--these alternate projections that directly reflect the
effects of specific monitored health trends--and to identify the
population-level interventions that would be needed to con-
tinue those positive health trends in the future. These alternate
health-based projections imply a substantial downward revi-
sion in estimates of the size of the elderly population with
chronic disability and, thus, with high, long-term, cumulating
health costs. There necessarily also is implied a corresponding
revision in the level and structure of projected health service
demand. We also present evidence supporting the roles of a
range of primary prevention and curative medical interven-
tions in promoting extant declines in disability among the
elderly. We are interested, in particular, in prevention and
curative strategies and medical treatments that will transform
chronic disease processes requiring chronic care into acute
disease events by medically truncating the disease process (e.g.,
ref. 7). Finally, we will delineate the future longitudinal data
sources that will be needed to monitor, and make more
informed assessments of, U.S. health status dynamics. These
data, and better forecasting models, will make possible more
detailed and defensible projections of the complete long-term
economic consequences of U.S. health status dynamics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data from the 1982, 1984, 1989, and 1994 National
Long-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS). These are nationally
representative longitudinal surveys of the U.S. population
(both community and institutional residents) aged 65 at each
date. The survey instruments used in all four waves concen-
trate on chronic impairments and morbidities. Those sets of
questions were unchanged across the four survey waves.
To be defined as chronically disabled when initially selected
for a detailed interview, a sample person had to have at least
one disability in an activity of daily living (ADL; ref. 8) or
instrumental activity of daily living (IADL; ref. 9), and such
disability had to have lasted, or was expected to last, at least
90 days. Chronic disability was grouped into five categories,
i.e., those with one or more IADLs impaired (but no ADL
impaired), those with 1­2, 3­4, or 5­6 ADLs impaired (with
or without IADL impairments), or persons residing in chronic
care institutions who report being chronically disabled. All
other persons were defined as not being chronically disabled.

Response rates were uniformly high (95%) in all four
surveys. Mortality follow-up is virtually 100% because report-
ing of deaths is required by the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) and is computerized in Medicare data
systems. Samples of approximately 20,000 persons were drawn
in each survey year from Medicare enrollment lists of persons
aged 65. Overall, in the four surveys, there were 35,848
distinct individuals. Roughly 17,000 deaths occurred from 1982
to 1996. To track both positive and negative changes in
disability, in each year persons who were chronically disabled
or institutionalized in prior survey years were automatically
selected for detailed community or institutional interviews. In
addition, roughly 14,000 persons in each survey year were
screened for incident disability. Longitudinal samples were
supplemented to ensure representation of all persons in the
U.S. aged 65 and older by drawing new Medicare list samples
of roughly 5,000 beneficiaries who passed age 65 between any
two interview dates.
Estimates of the range of potential effects of early inter-
ventions on risk factor processes (10) on disability were based
on multivariate analyses of longitudinal risk factor, morbidity,
and mortality data from the Framingham Heart Study (11).
Initiated in 1950, with 2,336 males and 2,873 females aged
29­62, the Framingham Study included biennial assessments
of the following risk factors for chronic diseases, which we
analyzed by using a multivariate, stochastic process model of
state variable dynamics: diastolic blood pressure, pulse pres-
sure, serum cholesterol, vital capacity index, hemoglobin,
hematocrit, smoking, body mass index, blood sugar, ventricular
(heart) rate, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The fundamen-
tal relation of risk factors to chronic morbidity, disability, and
mortality was estimated from the 34-year follow-up data from
Framingham by using a stochastic process model of risk factor
dynamics coupled to a hazard function for morbiditymortality
that was an age-dependent quadratic form in the risk factor
variables. For details about the parametric structure of this
model and details of its estimation, see ref. 12. Although risk
factor mean levels and their variances and covariances will vary
across populations, it is assumed that the basic model param-
eters estimated from the longitudinally followed Framingham
study population represent physiological mechanisms intrinsic
to the temporally evolving relation of risk factors to chronic
disease risks in humans.
Age-specific disability rates for persons in 5-year categories
from ages 65 to 69, 90 to 94, and 95 were calculated from the
1982 and 1994 NLTCS. The two sets of age-specific disability
rates were direct-age-standardized to U.S. population projec-
tions for 1994­2070 (13). This differs from the usual demo-
graphic application of the age standardization of populations
in which two or more sets of age-specific rates are compared
using one select population as a standard. Here we have only
two sets of age-specific rates but 76 different standard popu-
lations (i.e., for each year 1994­2070) to which we apply those
rates. The years for which the detailed calculations are re-
ported were 1982, 1994, and 2010 [before the World War II
(WWII) baby boom cohorts pass age 65], 2030 (after the last
WWII baby boom cohort passes age 65), and 2060 and 2070
(two dates near the end of the projection to see which effects
the later non-WWII baby boom cohorts have on Medicare
expenditures). Furthermore, the 1994 disability rates were
reduced by 1.5% for each year since 1994--consistent with the
most recent (1989­1994) annual disability rates of decline (1).
The 1982 disability rates were held constant. Thus, both sets of
age-standardized chronic disability rates changed because of
projected changes in the age distribution of the elderly pop-
ulation.
Projections of the number of chronically disabled elderly
persons were produced by applying the age-specific disability
or institutionalized rates observed for 1982 and 1994--
assuming a 1.5% per annum decline after 1994--to three
alternate population projections produced in 1996 by the U.S.
SSA (14) and an approximation of the ``low-cost'' projection
developed in 1996 for the Federal Hospital Insurance (Medi-
care Part A) Trust Fund (17). Life tables (18) were, in a
separate set of calculations, combined with age-specific dis-
ability rate estimates to show the changes in the period-specific
age relation of disability and mortality in 1994 and as it is
projected for 2070.
An alternative life expectancy scenario was based on pop-
ulation projections for the years 2010, 2030, 2060, and 2070
constrained by estimates based on alternative risk factor
distributions (means and variances) and altered risk factor
dynamics (both deterministic and stochastic process compo-
nents) from the Framingham Heart Study. To assess the upper
range of life expectancy that was biologically feasible, it was
assumed that, beginning in 2010, major risk factor interven-
tions were possible. We assumed that risk factor means could
be set to ``optimal'' levels (12) and that risk factor variances
were reduced by 75% initially, with the variance reduction
increasing to 100% 20 years after initiation of the interven-
tions. Not surprisingly, this produced much higher life expect-
ancy projections than the official series of projections put forth
by the SSA and HCFA. Details of the analytical and statistical
strategy used to generate the risk factor-related mortality
changes and life expectancy forecasts are reported in ref. 4.
RESULTS
To understand what the changes in the chronically disabled
population aged 65 meant in terms of the payroll tax burden
on the U.S. population aged 20­64, we calculated a health-
adjusted support ratio--i.e., the ratio of the number of persons
in the U.S. population aged 20­64 to the number of chronically
disabled persons aged 65. This differs from standard eco-
nomic ``support ratio'' calculations made for SSA by being
adjusted for changes in the prevalence of chronic disability in
the elderly population--an important determinant of health
costs. A non-health-adjusted support ratio may be more ap-
propriate for Social Security Trust Fund calculations in which
all survivors aged 65, regardless of health, receive a pension.
The health-adjusted support ratio assumes that the average
health care costs for persons aged 65 are a function of the
population prevalence of chronic disability. Chronic disability
is a good predictor of health care costs because chronically
disabled persons generally have much higher medical expenses
than nondisabled persons and have them for more prolonged
periods of time (17).
The prevalence of chronic disability also can be viewed as a
``leading'' indicator of health changes in the elderly population.
This is supported by the fact that the observed declines in the
proportion of the U.S. elderly population chronically disabled
over time make it plausible that the proportion of the popu-
lation aged 65 with chronic morbidity, before the onset of
disability, also has been declining (as discussed in ref. 5 and
K.G.M. and K. C. Land, unpublished results). Thus, the
proportion of the elderly population chronically disabled is a
good index of the population ill-health burden. It foreshadows
most shifts in the total distribution of acute and chronic health
care costs among the U.S. elderly population. It is of interest
that the differentials in certain major health cost components
(e.g., home health care use) because of disability have in-
creased significantly from 1982 to 1994.
Disability-adjusted support ratios, calculated for each of
eight population growth scenarios, are shown in Fig. 1. Six
scenarios are based on population forecasts (I*, II*, and III*)
made by SSA in 1996. I* assumes high mortality, fertility, and
immigration; III* assumes low mortality, fertility, and immi-
gration; and II* assumes intermediate levels on all three
components (14). These projections provide the demographic
basis for the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund projections.

Two more alternatives, A and A*, are an interpretation of the
``low-cost'' projections used in the HI Trust Fund report where
life expectancy is assumed to peak at the values (73.0 years for
males; 79.3 years for females) projected by SSA (12) for their
alternate projection I for the year 2000.
Three of the four projections with the 1.5% per annum
disability decline keep the support ratio above its 1994 value
(i.e., 22 economically active persons aged 25­64 for each
chronically disabled person aged 65) in all years for which the
ratio is calculated. In contrast, when no changes in disability
are assumed, the support ratio rapidly drops below the 22:1
ratio observed in 1994, when the HI Trust Fund was in
approximate cash flow balance. The support ratio of 8:1
projected for the intermediate SSA assumptions with no
changes in disability is, in 2070, 63% below the observed ratio
for 1994. The calculations assume that the unemployment- and
disability-dependent proportions of the population aged
20­64 remain, on average, at their 1994 levels, when program
income and costs were roughly in balance.
In addition to these scenarios it is important to consider that
there is more uncertainty about future projections of U.S.
population size than SSA recognizes (15, 16). Projections
implying longer life expectancy than in SSA scenarios could
lead to problems with HI Trust Fund balances even with the
continuation of 1.5% annual disability declines. Achieving a
balance between program income and costs then might require
a somewhat higher rate of disability decline andor longer
active working life for the aged 65 population.
To indicate what plausibly might be accomplished by early-
in-life major interventions on multiple risk factors, Fig. 2
displays the probabilities of not being disabled and survival
probabilities for specific ages under different forecasting sce-
narios.
Curve A represents the age-specific survival probabilities in
1994. As an alternative, curve C represents age-specific sur-
vival probabilities in 2070, projected by using the stochastic
process model of risk factor dynamics (12) calibrated on
Framingham data and assuming major interventions in mul-
tiple risk factors as of 2010. The total area under this curve is
the risk factor-adjusted projected life expectancy in 2070, i.e.,
98 years, far exceeding any of the current SSA or HCFA life
expectancy projections. Curve B represents the age-specific
probabilities of being free of chronic disability in 1994. Curve
D represents the age curves corresponding to the probabilities
of not being disabled in 2070, assuming a 1.5% per annum
decline after 1994. The area between curves A and B (compare
with the relation of C and D) represents the expected number
of years spent chronically disabled under the respective sce-
narios. The key point is that the area between C and D in 2070
indicates that about 3 years is expected to be lived in a
chronically impaired state. This is less than the difference
between A and B, which suggests about 6 years of chronically
impaired life expectancy. That is, even with the much greater
overall life expectancy forecast for 2070, there are fewer years
expected to be lived by individuals, absolutely and relatively, in
chronically disabled states.
Since health costs are a function of both the duration and
intensity of medical problems, this suggests that the projected
declines in chronic disability could have a large effect on future
health costs. Although disability is assumed to decline to ages
95, the largest absolute number of persons with disability
prevented by 2070 would be aged 65­90.
Additional calculations done for the above scenarios indi-
cate that the differences in 2070 in the number of persons
chronically disabled who are older than 65, assuming a 1.5%
per annum reduction in disability, vs. an assumption of no
disability change is about 20 million persons. Furthermore,
16.2 million (82.7%) of the total 19.6 million cases of chronic
disability projected to be avoided in 2070 if disability rates
declined 1.5% per annum are in the age range of 65­89. Thus,
most of the projected disability decline would occur at rela-
tively young old ages for which we already have significant
clinical experience in reducing disability (20, 21) or in treating
many chronic medical problems (22, 23).
DISCUSSION
Our calculations assumed that chronic disability could, with
the appropriate public health programs and sufficient biomed-
ical research investments, decline by 1.5% per annum for each
year in the 75-year period, 1995­2070. Achievement of declines
of this magnitude would require large-scale adoption of pre-
ventive strategies, broad dissemination of the existing ``best''
and new medical technologies to the U.S. elderly population,
and significant new investment in biomedical research to
continue, and increase, the current rate of biotechnology
innovations. Several lines of evidence suggest that this rate of
improvement (i.e., 1.5% per annum) with the appropriate
interventions is a plausible average rate of decline to maintain
for a prolonged period of time with a well developed multi-
dimensional national strategic health program.
The 1982­1994 NLTCS already shows that a 1.5% rate of
decline in chronic disability above age 65 is achievable, and
other data even suggest that the rate of disability decline may
be further accelerating. Furthermore, other evidence suggests
that sizable declines in chronic disease prevalence and related
disabilities have been occurring in the U.S. for more than 75
years without the benefit of major health research programs.
Fogel (23) found that chronic disease prevalence in males
declined 6% per decade from 1910 to 1985--roughly a 0.62%

per annum decline in chronic disease risks for the 75-year
period. These declines were achieved largely because of un-
planned interventions, with relatively primitive medical and
public health technologies, when relatively little was known
about the mechanisms of chronic disease processes occurring
at relatively advanced ages. For example, one major source of
the decline was a reduction in congestive heart failure appar-
ently due to declines in rheumatic heart disease at younger ages
over time.
New data suggest that nutritional factors affecting maternal
health and fetal development help explain why chronic disease
risks declined from 1910 to 1985 (2). Maternal nutritional
deficiencies (e.g., for the 1910 elderly Civil War veteran
cohorts, who were born in 1825­1844, whose mothers would
have such nutritional deficiencies up to 30 years earlier) could
have affected maternal pelvic development and increased
subsequent late-age risks for cerebrovascular disease in the
child (24). Maternal nutritional deficiency during pregnancy
may impact the development of the pancreas and liver in the
fetus, which may alter risks of diabetes and heart disease in the
child as he or she ages (24).
In addition, environmental factors almost certainly altered
chronic disease risks between 1910 and 1985. For example, in
the 1920s and 1930s, changes in food preservation, thermal
preparation, and storage that affected microbial food contam-
inants, salt intake, and changes in water quality (e.g., reducing
the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infections) could have
affected a wide range of chronic diseases including stroke,
hypertension, gastric and other cancer, and gastric ulcers (25,
26). Thus, it is of further interest that Perutz (27) recently
found a similar temporal pattern implied by the time rate of
growth of the British centenarian population. Up until the
1940s it grew 1% per year. After the 1940s (i.e., centenarians
born after the 1840s) the growth rate was nearer 6%. Thus, in
Britain, as well as the U.S., there appeared to be major
socioeconomic and nutritional changes affecting the health
and survival of the post-1840 birth cohorts.
If unplanned nutritional and environmental changes with
primitive medical technologies produced a 0.62% per annum
decrease in chronic morbidity from 1910 to 1985, it seems that
the 1.5% per annum decrease in chronic disability observed in
recent years might be maintained in a cost-effective fashion by
appropriate investment in biomedical and epidemiological
research, rapid promulgation of new biotechnologies, more
aggressive efforts at public health intervention (e.g., smoking
cessation, promotion of physical activity, behavioral changes in
dietary consumption), and, in the more complete population,
dissemination of the highest-quality health care.
There are currently many diseases for which known inter-
ventions have been proved cost-effective but for which, for a
variety of reasons, the full-population health benefit of the
intervention has not been experienced. For example, coronary
revascularization procedures in U.S. African Americans ap-
pear underutilized. In patients for whom the procedure was
most likely to be effective (i.e., for whom the extension of life
was expected to be greater than 1 year), there were signifi-
cantly fewer Blacks (42%) than Whites (61%) being treated
(28). It has been estimated that adjunctive drug therapy after
acute myocardial infarction may reduce mortality by 5­30%.
Such therapies, if fully utilized, thus could prevent large
numbers of premature deaths (29).
Concerning prevention per se, there is a substantial and
growing body of literature documenting the protective effects
of regular, vigorous physical exercise (30, 31), appropriate
dietary supplementation of vitamins B6
, B12
, E, and folate (32),
and reductions in fat intake. For example, supplementation
with B vitamins could reduce circulatory disease deaths by
more than 50,000 per year (32). It has been estimated (6) that
a nationwide reduction in fat intake could defer approximately
2% of deaths in U.S. adults each year and increase total U.S.
life expectancy by 3­4 months. A recent study (33) showed that
persons with lower health risks (defined in terms of smoking,
body-mass index, and exercise) have less incident disability at
older ages and lower levels of cumulative disability and dis-
ability at any given age than do persons with higher health risks
from the above set. They showed that, while life expectancy
increased because of health interventions, the years lived in an
active state also increased. A recent longitudinal study (34)
showed that better risk-factor profiles were associated with
reduced Medicare Part A spending.
Adoption of protective behavioral and lifestyle practices
often depends on a person's level of education and consequent
compliance. Changes in the educational level of the elderly
population could help sustain a decline of 1.5% per annum in
chronic disability for at least another 35 years. Preston (3)
projected that the proportion of persons aged 85­89 with less
than 8 years of education would decline from about 65% in
1980 to about 15% in 2015. A projection assuming all persons
aged 65 had 8 or more years of education in 1990 suggests
that disability could decline to 2025 (when the 1990 cohorts
aged 65 reach ages 100) by 2.1­2.2% per annum (35,
36)--nearly 40% faster than the rates assumed in the projec-
tions presented above.
More informed assessments of health status dynamics and
defensible projections of their economic consequences would
be greatly facilitated by relatively modest amendments to the
design and conduct of future NLTCS. It would be important
to enroll younger cohorts with lifestyle, behavioral, and phys-
iologic risk-factor assessments to allow for prospective evalu-
ation of the population adoption of preventive interventions
and later-life incident disability in individuals. More extensive
assessment of the range of daily physical and social activities
of the elderly would allow for documentation of leisure
activities and expenditures for them. We view this latter
addendum to current data collection efforts to be particularly
important to accurately assess national health trends at the
individual level, for developing a more comprehensive eco-
nomic analysis of the impact of high-technology preventive and
curative interventions (e.g., which chronic diseases are cured
or truncated to acute events; ref. 38), and to assess the
long-term economic returns to basic biomedical research
investment.
Much of the extant health economics literature (38, 39)
views the future availability of such high-technology interven-
tions as directly linked to an increase in demand for them and,
hence, substantial increases in health insurance costs. One of
the elements neglected in such analyses is the simultaneous
consideration of the positive economic benefit of a vastly
expanded leisuresportsvacationhealth-fitness industry con-
sequential to significantly increased disability-free life years
(40). Another factor possibly not given sufficient weight is the
effect of ``postinnovation innovation'' (41), or the maturation
of a therapy or technology after its introduction (e.g., CAT
scanners), where efficacy and indication for use can greatly
expand. Furthermore, with the extant fertility declines leading
to relatively smaller future cohorts of working-age people--an
additional 5 years of productive disability-free working life for
persons aged 65 could have a very positive benefit in terms
of SSA and Medicare Trust Fund balances. The 1.5% per
annum reduction in chronic disability would provide 3 of those
5 years without any changes in U.S. life expectancy. To the
extent that such disability reduction extends active life expect-
ancy the benefit could be far more than 5 years. A compre-
hensive economic analysis incorporating these various eco-
nomic, health, and technological dynamics lies in the future.
