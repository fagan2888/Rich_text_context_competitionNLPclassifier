Introduction
In the wake of the "Great Recession," employers' attempts
to cut labor costs have often involved controlling workers'
time. Wal-Mart's automated system alerts managers when
workers approach 40 hours, so those managers can send
workers home before they would qualify for either full-
time benefits or overtime (Negrey, 2012). At the same time,
more and more workers are classified as "exempt" from
overtime pay and are pushed to work longer hours without
additional compensation (Negrey, 2012). As the American
economy becomes increasingly bifurcated into these two
kinds of employment, an ever-growing proportion of workers
face diminishing control over their work time. This loss of
control is of particular concern because control over one's
working environment is associated with both physical and
mental health--critical elements of well-functioning econ-
omies and societies (Marmot, Bosma, Hemingway, Brunner,
& Stansfeld, 1997).
Controlling work hours has long been a point of conten-
tion between workers and employers. Economic conditions
since the beginning of the "Great Recession" have only made
disputes over work time more intense. Although both those
who struggle to find sufficient hours and those who contend
with long hours and overwork feel economically trapped and
socially coerced, the nature of these disputes vary across a
segmented labor force (Glenn, 2002; Jacobs & Gerson, 2004;
Negrey, 2012; Uttal & Tuominen, 1999). It is these differ-
ences in the ways differently situated workers are impacted
by different kinds of struggles for worktime control (WTC)
that are the focus of this article. I investigate how the lives of
workers in a stratified labor market are differently affected
by varying distributions and kinds of control over their work
time. The simultaneous examination of the effects of different
kinds of control on different kinds of workers will contribute
to our understanding of how processes related to WTC are
implicated in maintaining social inequality.

The Impacts of Worktime Control
in Context: A Comparison Across
Occupations in the U.S. Health Care
Industry
Jackie Stein1
Abstract
This article examines the relationships between workers' control over their working time and their well-being, looking at
how these relationships differ across a set of health care occupations that are stratified by class, gender, and race (physicians,
nurses, emergency medical technicians [EMTs], and certified nursing assistants [CNAs]). Across occupations, workers' ability
to control their schedules decreases their job-related stress. The results show that different dimensions of worktime control
(WTC) affect workers in different occupations in distinctive ways, offering a corrective to prior work that combines workers
who occupy different locations in the system of social stratification. Among nursing assistants--the most socially marginalized
group in the study--the relationships between particular aspects of WTC and job stress were distinct from those associations
among the other three occupations, reinforcing the importance of examining these relationships in occupationally specific
contexts. This kind of comparative perspective illuminates the ways distributions of intangible resources such as WTC both
emerge from and reinforce existing patterns of social stratification. The implications of these differences for research and
policy are discussed.

This study is grounded by JoanAcker's concept of inequal-
ity regimes. Acker (2009) holds that persistent inequalities
are created, maintained, and reproduced through "the every-
day practices of organization participants" (p. 213). The
workers in this study are all from the health care industry,
working under conditions of unpredictable demands in a
24-hr cycle of care, where navigating control over working
time is a central "everyday practice." Drawing upon Acker,
the driving question underlying this article is as follows: In
what ways is the availability and distribution of WTC impli-
cated in the processes of stratification? More concretely, this
study was guided by three research questions:
Research Question 1: What are the relationships between
various dimensions of WTC and job-related stress?
Research Question 2: How do these relationships differ
across health care occupations differentiated by class,
gender, and race?
Research Question 3: What do these different relation-
ships reveal about the role of WTC in organizational
processes of stratification?
I expect that worker control over work time is an impor-
tant predictor of worker distress across occupations, net the
total number of hours worked. Furthermore, I argue that the
character of this relationship between WTC and distress
varies across these occupations in ways that reflect the gen-
der, class, and race systems that shape these occupations.
Because control over work time, like other social resources,
is distributed based on systems of social stratification, its
consequences for worker health and well-being arguably
perpetuate this societal stratification. The distribution of
these material consequences can impact workers' lives in a
way that shapes their paths in the labor market and their life
courses, more broadly.
Background: Stratification Within the
U.S. Health Care Industry
In the United States, the health care industry provides a par-
ticularly appropriate setting in which to study variations in
control over work time. It is an industry known for its 24/7
schedule and thus the continuous temporal demands it places
on its workers. The industry is also rapidly growing, both in
workers and in cost. It was one of the largest industry sectors
in 2013, providing more than 15.8 million jobs (Henderson,
2012; Torpey, 2014). Furthermore, the health care and social
services sector is projected to have both the largest and the
fastest growth between 2012 and 2022, with more than 4 mil-
lion new jobs expected during that time (Torpey, 2014).
Health care spending is projected to comprise more than
25% of the total federal budget in fiscal year 2015 (National
Priorities Project, 2015). With this kind of growth, and due to
widespread publicity over the recently enacted health care
law (the Affordable Care Act), the health care industry is
under increasing budgetary scrutiny. This scrutiny, in turn,
puts pressure on health care­providing organizations to
lower costs--among which worker pay features prominently.
Importantly, in addition to being increasingly dominant
forces in the landscape of work, these organizations in the
health care industry are also places of visible segmentation
by gender, race, and class, making them crucial sites for
studying the processes that maintain inequality.
This study focuses on four occupations within this indus-
try: physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians
(EMTs), and certified nursing assistants (CNAs)--jobs that
are highly stratified by gender, class, and race (Glazer, 1991;
Glenn, 1992; Hine, 1989; Scherzer, 2003). Nationally, almost
all registered nurses and CNAs are women (about 90% of
each), while women make up 36% of physicians and sur-
geons and 39% of EMTs (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013a).
The annual median wage nationally for family- and general-
practice physicians (who are among the lower paid physi-
cians) was US$176,530 in 2012, more than 2.5 times that of
registered nurses (US$66,220), more than 5 times that of
EMTs (US$31,270), and 7 times the annual median wage for
CNAs (US$24,890; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013b). In
our data, more than 30% of nurses and EMTs have bache-
lor's degrees, compared with fewer than 4% of CNAs.
Moreover, all physicians have master's degrees plus addi-
tional graduate-level education, the minimum required by
the American Medical Association to practice (American
Medical Association, 2012). Thus, in their gender, education,
and income profiles, these occupations are quite distinct.
CNAs are particularly distinct from the other three occu-
pations. In addition to being predominantly female and hav-
ing the lowest incomes and educations, CNAs are the only
occupation of the four that is not majority White. Whites
make up fewer than half of these workers, nationally, and
African Americans about 36%. By contrast, 83% of EMTs
are White. Nurses and physicians fall in between with 75%
and 68% of these occupations, respectively, represented by
Whites (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013a). Of the 25%
racial minority representation among nurses, African
Americans make up about half, whereas among physicians
the predominant minority race is Asian (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2013a). In health care, as in other industries, peo-
ple of color (especially African Americans and Latina/os) are
disproportionately represented in the lowest paid jobs (Slack
& Jensen, 2011).
The distinct social locations of these occupations within
the same industry--and in some cases, within the same orga-
nizations--provide a unique opportunity for comparison. The
literature about work time suggests that the same societal
hierarchies that divide these occupations are also manifested
in distinct patterns of work hours and schedules for each of
these groups of workers (Clawson & Gerstel, 2014; Clawson,
Gerstel, & Crocker, 2008; Jacobs & Gerson, 2004; Negrey,
2012; Presser, 2003). All of these occupations present useful
comparisons with one another. CNAs are in a particularly
Stein 3
disadvantaged position compared with the other occupations
in facing race, class, and gender marginalization, and thus we
expect this group might have a unique pattern in the relation-
ship between WTC and worker outcomes.
Using this comparative lens across occupations, this study
extends the current literature by looking specifically at how
access to control over work hours and schedules impacts
differently-situated workers, net the total hours themselves.
It also explores the implications for workers of this differen-
tial access to WTC--both as a reflection of worker power
and as a mechanism reinforcing the processes that maintain
occupational stratification.
Literature Review
Control Over Work Time
Control over the conditions of work has long been associated
with worker stress and distress outcomes. Theories generally
hold that greater control over one's job reduces worker
stress (Collins, Karasek, & Costas, 2005; Hausser, Mojzisch,
Niesel, & Schulz-Hardt, 2010; Marmot et al., 1997; Steptoe
& Willemsen, 2004). Control over the time one spends work-
ing is integral to a sense of control at work and, over the past
decade, scholars have begun to separate out, theoretically,
workers' control over working time from control over other
work conditions. Employee control over work time or WTC
gauges the discretion individual workers feel in determining
the amount and scheduling of their working time (Beckers,
Kompier, Kecklund, & Härmä, 2012; Berg, Appelbaum,
Bailey, & Kalleberg, 2004; Härmä, Kompier, & Vahtera,
2006; Moen, Kelly, & Huang, 2008).Aspects of WTC include
control over starting and ending times, break times, vacation
or time off, distribution of workdays over the week, quantity
of hours, and whether and when to work overtime (Geurts,
Beckers, Taris, Kompier, & Smulders, 2008; Moen et al.,
2008; Nijp, Beckers, Geurts, Tucker, & Kompier, 2012).
Several long-standing theories tie WTC to worker well-
being. Effort-recovery theory suggests that WTC enables
workers to balance effort with recovery, whether through the
control of break times while at work or recuperation through
control of time spent away from work (Meijman & Mulder,
1998). Looking at WTC as a subdimension of general auton-
omy, self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), the job
characteristic model (Hackman & Oldham, 1976), and the
demands-control model (Karasek, 1979; Karasek & Theorell,
1991), all suggest that increased WTC may stimulate worker
motivation, improve health and performance, and prevent
stress. These effects of greater WTC are proposed to derive
from at least two processes: utilization, where workers actu-
ally change their working time, or through perception, where
the opportunity to self-determine work hours helps workers,
regardless of an actual change in amount of working time
(Beckers et al., 2012). Finally, theories of work­home interac-
tion suggest that greater WTC might improve work/nonwork
balance (and thus prevent stress) through workers' ability to
adjust working time to meet the needs and obligations of their
nonwork lives (Beckers et al., 2012; Geurts et al., 2008; Geurts
& Demerouti, 2003).
A broad literature in fields ranging from applied ergo-
nomics to management to public health and sociology offers
evidence to support these theories, suggesting a positive rela-
tionship between workers'control over the timing and length
of their work hours and their well-being. Outcomes related to
increased WTC include reduced physical and psychological
distress (Costa, Sartori, & Åkerstedt, 2006; de Jonge,
Vegchel, Shimazu, Schaufeli, & Dormann, 2010; D'Souza,
Strazdins, Lim, Broom, & Rodgers, 2003; Takahashi et al.,
2011), reduced sense of work­family conflict (Fenwick &
Tausig, 2004; Geurts et al., 2008; Golden, Wiens-Tuers,
Lambert, & Henly, 2011; Hughes & Parkes, 2007; Moen
et al., 2008), a greater feeling of income adequacy (Moen
et al., 2008), increased job commitment (Halpern, 2005), and
reduced rates of sickness-related absence from work (Ala-
Mursula et al., 2006; Ala-Mursula, Vahtera, Linna, Pentti, &
Kivimäki, 2005).
Despite the myriad ways WTC seems to benefit workers,
a recent systematic review of the literature suggests that
there are still important gaps in our understanding of the rela-
tionship between WTC and worker well-being (Nijp et al.,
2012). Indeed, a recent study of hospital employees across
European countries found no effect of worktime autonomy
on workers' health (Pisljar, van der Lippe, & den Dulk,
2011). Recent reviews suggest that prior research did not
specify the particular subdimensions of WTC and worker
well-being nor did it consider the differential benefits to
workers in different social positions (Hausser et al., 2010;
Nijp et al., 2012). These reviews suggest that teasing apart
the different aspects of control over work time would further
our attempts to understand the buffering effects of WTC on
worker well-being. This study begins to fill this gap in the
literature by looking at the effects of different aspects of
WTC on workers in different occupations.
Occupational Differences in Worktime
Experiences
The effects of various aspects of WTC on well-being likely
depend on workers' different social positions (Nijp et al.,
2012). In particular, the social stratification of power across
occupations means schedule control is likely more available
to workers in some jobs than others (Negrey, 2012). Recently,
cross-country comparative studies have begun to explore the
impacts of social and institutional context on the relationship
between WTC and worker well-being (Berg et al., 2004;
Lyness, Gornick, Stone, & Grotto, 2012; Pisljar et al., 2011),
but comparison across social contexts within a society is still
rare. When they are taken into account, these intrasocietal
social contexts, such as occupation, are often added to a
model as control variables, rather than a lens through which
4 SAGE Open
to look at the relationship between WTC and worker well-
being outcomes (see, for example, Pisljar et al., 2011). In one
exception the buffering effects of worker job control (includ-
ing WTC) on worker well-being were examined across
different occupational sectors in the Netherlands (de Jonge,
Dollard, Dormann, Le Blanc, & Houtman, 2000). They
found that the interactive relationship between job demands
and job control depended on the occupational sector,
suggesting that looking at occupational context might
improve our understanding of specific WTC­worker well-
being relationships.
Few studies explicitly compare the effects of WTC across
occupational contexts differentiated by gender, class, and
race. However, some studies do compare the relationship
between WTC and worker well-being at an individual
level--across individuals with different positions in these
social systems. For example, Takahashi et al. (2011) find that
most of the effects of WTC (control over daily working hours
and days off) on well-being outcomes were the same regard-
less of an individual's gender. In the exception, insomnia
symptoms decreased with control over daily working hours
for men, but not for women. Lyness et al. (2012) find that
lack of control over work hours has greater negative conse-
quences for women than for men. However, their analysis of
the relationship between schedule control and a particular set
of worker consequences (work­family conflict, job satisfac-
tion, and organizational commitment) suggests that this rela-
tionship might not vary by workers' social class (Lyness
et al., 2012). Nevertheless, low-wage or lower class workers
tend to have less schedule control than workers in higher
social class positions, both in the United States and cross-
nationally (Clawson & Gerstel, 2014; Lambert, 2008; Lyness
et al., 2012; Watson & Swanberg, 2011).
Looking at gender and class at an occupational level
rather than an individual level is practically and analytically
important because those compositions shape organizational
policies as well as the practices and responses of both
employers and employees (Acker, 2006; Lorber, 2005;
Ridgeway, 2011; Wright, 2008). Systems of class, gender,
and race do not simply serve as characteristics of individuals
but also as operating principles that shape the social ecolo-
gies of occupations. Thus, rather than examining either a het-
erogeneous collection of individuals scattered across a range
of occupations or comparing men and women in the same
occupation, this study's design takes as its central point of
comparison occupations that are segregated by race, gender,
and class.
According to both theory and empirical research, not only
is the class location of an occupation associated with varied
work conditions, but an occupation where workers are pre-
dominantly women tends to have a mode of operation that
differs from an overwhelmingly male occupation and differs
as well from one that is closer to gender balanced; so, too, an
occupation that is racially segregated differs from one that is
racially balanced or integrated (Acker, 2006; Glenn, 2009,
2010; Lorber, 2005; Ridgeway, 2011; Ridgeway & Fisk,
2012). This study's design maximizes the ability to explore
differences in workers' experiences across these occupa-
tional ecologies, thereby extending the models that are
currently used to understand the relationship between WTC
and worker well-being.
This occupational perspective also reflects a focus on the
organizational processes shaping workers' lives. These pro-
cesses sort jobs into types according to class, gender, and
race through everyday management practices that racialize
and sexualize definitions of "good" job performance and
"skill" (Acker, 2006). Such definitions are then used to jus-
tify pay and other job characteristics, such as level of worker
control or autonomy (Acker, 2006). Thus, the activities asso-
ciated with each occupation are bound up with larger social
and organizational processes and we look at occupations as
ecologies shaped by these processes instead of controlling
for job characteristics individually. In other words, by
comparing experiences across occupations, rather than indi-
viduals, this project focuses on the consequences of these
sorting and tracking processes, specifically those related to
control over work time.
Health Care Occupations and WTC
This article looks specifically at health care occupations that
vary in their gender, class, and racial composition. Health
care occupations are similar in that they generally require the
physical presence of the worker, which presents a set of
unique scheduling demands. However, even among these
occupations that require a physical presence, challenges to
schedule control differ due to the gendered expectations of
the workers, the resources available to workers in different
occupations, and the power balance between workers and
employers. Comparing occupations in health care can help
us understand how workers in different social contexts and
locations are affected by WTC.
Gendered expectations of workers can compound differ-
ences in material resources among workers and these can
translate into different scheduling needs. For example,
predominantly male physicians are often able to enact a
"breadwinner" paradigm. As salaried workers, they struggle
against the constant pressure to work more hours (Jacobs &
Gerson, 2004), but they earn high enough wages that they
can either pay someone else to take care of their obligations
outside of work--such as child care or cleaning--or have
spouses who can manage the household because they often
do not work for wages or work part-time.
However, predominantly female nurses, despite earning
moderate wages and being employed full-time, face gen-
dered expectations to manage their children and household
life in addition to working for pay. Because their spouses
also typically work full-time, nurses often balance the cost of
services and the negotiation of work schedules so that they
can take care of home and care obligations themselves.
Stein 5
CNAs--who are low-wage, predominantly female, and often
women of color--frequently cannot afford to pay someone
to take care of their obligations outside of work and also can-
not afford the loss of wages that would come with cutting
down on work time to take care of those obligations them-
selves. They are often forced to choose between handling
family emergencies--such as picking up a sick child from
school--and losing wages or possibly their job. In these
ways and others, gender and class forces interact to create
not only different levels of schedule control but also different
needs for control among different health care workers
(Gerstel & Clawson, 2014).
In addition to being caught between the imperatives of
family and wages, low-wage care workers, such as CNAs,
also continue to have the least access to policies that would
give them greater control over their schedules (Bond &
Galinsky, 2006; Clawson & Gerstel, 2014; Lambert & Henly,
2009). This lack of access to schedule control is of particular
concern for these workers who already have less control over
other aspects of their jobs. As well as being paid less, nursing
assistants are often marginalized by gendered and racialized
occupational segregation into the "dirty work"--bearing the
primary responsibility for the "dirtiest" and most physically
challenging aspects of caregiving such as bathing, dressing,
feeding, and changing briefs and bedpans (Duffy, 2007;
Glenn, 1992). Nurses' work, by contrast, typically involves
more managerial and less hands-on work: developing and
managing nursing care plans, controlling and delivering
medicine, and assisting physicians during treatments and
exams. With their physically demanding work, nursing assis-
tants have some of the highest nonfatal injuries and illness
rates for all U.S. occupations, the fourth highest in 2012
(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013c). These factors all suggest
that the relationship between WTC and well-being for CNAs
might be unique among the four occupations.
Worker Characteristics Affecting WTC
This study grounds itself in the perspective that workers'
needs for schedule control will differ across occupations that
are divided in their gender and class compositions. We sug-
gest that occupations themselves are systems sufficiently
stratified by gender, race, and class that workers'experiences
across these occupations will reflect these dominant social
divisions, thus obviating the need to measure these as indi-
vidual worker characteristics. However, the literature also
suggests accounting for other worker characteristics that
affect access to WTC. A worker's age and marital and family
status are often associated with use of "flexible" worktime
policies. Younger workers seem to use flexible scheduling
more than older workers (Allen, Herst, Bruck, & Sutton,
2000; Tausig & Fenwick, 2001). Unmarried workers tend to
have less control over the timing of their work than married
workers, but the causal direction of this relationship is
unclear because the effect seems largely attributable to the
higher schedule control found among workers with young
children at home (especially women with preschool­aged
children; Golden, 2001, 2008; Presser, 1989; Sharpe,
Hermsen, & Billings, 2002). Single parenthood, as might be
expected, leads to much greater competition between work
time and family time than partnered parenthood (Kendig &
Bianchi, 2008).
Beyond partnership and parental status, some other work-
ing conditions seem likely to affect workers'access to sched-
ule control and the consequences of such control on worker
well-being. Unionized workers may have greater access to
schedule control because they are likely to have better infor-
mation about policies regulating such control than nonunion-
ized workers (Budd & Mumford, 2006). Workers whose
hours include weekend work may have more stress associ-
ated with lack of WTC because weekend hours have been
found to be particularly stressful for workers in general
(Clawson & Gerstel, 2014). Finally, workers whose paid
work hours come from more than one job (more than 60% of
the EMTs in this study) might be expected to have a different
relationship between WTC and well-being. We account for
each of these factors in our analysis.
Research Agenda
As this review argues, an emerging wave of research has
focused on the effects that worker control over working
hours has on worker quality of life, but this research is just
beginning to look comparatively across intrasocietal occupa-
tional contexts and to tease apart the effects of particular sub-
dimensions of WTC. The present study contributes a unique
perspective to this emerging body of comparative work by
looking within the same country and industry at differences
in worker experiences across occupational locations that are
marked by gender and class stratification. Furthermore, this
study differentiates several dimensions of WTC, uniquely
creating an opportunity to examine how workers in specific
social locations have both different needs and differential
access to particular manifestations of WTC.
Method
Data
The data for this project come from a mail survey of CNAs,
nurses, physicians, and EMTs conducted in 2004 (for meth-
odological discussion, see Clawson & Gerstel, 2014; Gerstel,
Clawson, & Huyser, 2007). Since the survey was conducted,
time and money pressure on the health care industry and on
workers have only become more intense, and thus the find-
ings from these data likely represent a conservative estimate
of the relationships we explore. The sample was drawn from
Massachusetts, chosen to be demographically representative
of the national population but also within easy driving dis-
tance of the investigators' location (for the interview portion
6 SAGE Open
of the larger project of which this survey is a part). Because
the state requires workers in these occupations to register to
maintain legal certification, the sample frame was a current
list of all those legally certified for each occupation, allow-
ing the selection of a true random sample. Three waves of the
survey were sent out. Of the 800 surveys, only 9.6% were
returned as not having accurate addresses, indicating that the
lists were current and well maintained. Of the delivered
surveys, the overall response rate was an excellent 64.5%
(464 out of 719); for every group, the response rate was
greater than 50%; for CNAs, it was 53.9% (n = 89), for
physicians 57.6% (n = 102), for EMTs 64.7% (n = 119), and
for nurses 78.2% (n = 154).
Descriptive statistics are in Table 1. In their income, edu-
cation, and gender, participants' characteristics generally
reflected the national populations of these workers. Racially,
a higher proportion of all the occupations among the survey
participants were White than nationally, but this is represen-
tative of the New England region. EMTs in this sample also
had slightly higher annual incomes than nationally. This may
be due to the high rate of second-job holding among EMTs,
for whom we report total income from all jobs.
Having a second job meant significantly higher total work
hours among CNAs and EMTs, but not for physicians and
nurses. CNAs who had second jobs worked an average of 19
hr more per week than those who did not. EMTs with second
jobs worked an average of 14 hr more per week than those
without. CNAs with second jobs averaged 35 hr per week at
their main jobs and 23 hr per week at their second jobs.
EMTs with second jobs averaged 43 hr per week at their
main jobs and 18 hr per week at their second jobs.
As discussed, this study uses occupations as the lens of
comparison, treating them as organizational ecologies, shaped
by the gender, class, and race of the workers who predominate
in that occupation. To illustrate this stratification to the reader,
indicators of gender, race, and income are included in the
descriptive statistics. However, because of the study's design,
the regression models do not contain indicators of individual
respondents'class, gender, or race status. Instead, models were
run either within each occupation or including an occupation
variable as indicator of a particular social location.
Dependent Variable: Worker Job-Related Stress
Following the WTC literature, reduced job stress is used to
indicate increased worker well-being. Job stress was opera-
tionalized as the response to the statement, "My job really
wears me out." Responses were captured on a 5-point Likert-
type scale (from strongly disagree to strongly agree).
Independent Variables
WTC variables
Control over work time.Informed by the major theories
tying WTC to worker well-being, four survey items measure
different subdimensions of the central explanatory concept:
perceived control over work time. The first three measures
are responses to various statements about work hours and
schedules. On the survey, the following instructions intro-
duced these items:
Some people can choose their work hours and schedules and
some can't. Please rate the following statements on the following
scale from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree based on your
main job as a [occupation].
To measure workers' perceived ability to alter their
work schedules, the analysis includes responses to the
statement, "I can change my schedule when I need to, even
on short notice." A second item measures workers' ability
to adjust working time to meet the needs and obligations of
their nonwork lives, using responses to "I can always work
extra hours when I want to," which touches on both time
and monetary needs. To measure workers' sense of their
ability to self-determine their schedules, responses to "My
supervisor pressures me to work additional hours" are
included. Each of these measures is coded such that higher
numbers indicate increased agreement with the statement,
so a higher number on the "I can change my schedule"
variable indicates greater control, whereas a higher number
on the "my supervisor pressures me" indicates less control.
These items were standardized (M = 0, SD = 1) for easier
comparison.
To measure control over the amount of time spent away
from work (a dimension of WTC associated with Effort-
Recovery theory) and ability to balance work/ nonwork
time, a fourth measure compares workers' preferred quantity
of hours with their actual reported work hours. This con-
cept is sometimes called "hours mismatch" (Golden, 1996;
Reynolds, 2003). Unlike the other three measures of WTC,
which asked somewhat explicitly for workers' perceptions
of their own control over their work hours and schedules,
this variable attempts to capture workers' control over the
quantity of hours they work in a more implicit way, based
on the differences between their realities and their prefer-
ences. The variable was constructed by combining two
separate self-reports of work hours. First, respondents
reported the number of hours of paid employment they
would prefer to work each week. Several pages later, they
reported the number of hours they worked last week (or
usually). Using these two responses, we constructed a
dichotomous dummy variable to differentiate those respon-
dents who want to work fewer hours than they currently
work (coded 1) from those who want to work the same or
more hours than they currently work (coded 0).
Each of these items captures different manifestations of
WTC, which may have different relationships to distress.
Factor analysis confirmed that these items tapped different
concepts, as they did not form a single scale. Thus, each is
included in the model individually.

Worktime variables
Total work hours. This measures self-reported total hours
worked either in the previous week or in a typical week
(including second jobs).
Number of weekends worked.This measures number of
weekends worked in the past month to capture the timing
of work. .
Demographic variables. The analysis includes items measuring
respondents'age, union status, whether or not the respondent
has a second job, and their partnership and parental status.
Based on previous research indicating the intertwined effects
of partnership and parental status, I have combined these two
factors into a single measure with four values. Thus, single
parents of young children (<6 years old) are compared with
married or partnered parents of young children, married or
partnered individuals who do not have young children, and
single individuals who do not have young children.
Interaction variables
Interaction terms.To examine the different relationships
between WTC and worker stress in different occupations,
I created a set of multiplicative interaction terms, crossing
each of the four occupations with each of the four main time
control variables.
Statistical Methods
The baseline model for each occupation predicts worker job
stress based on weekly work hours, controlling for some
worker personal characteristics (Table2). This allows for an
evaluation of the main effects of work hours on worker
job stress. To this model for each occupation, I added WTC
variables to evaluate their effects on job stress and on the
main effect of work hours.
In addition, I ran an interactive model for each of the sub-
dimensions of WTC (Table 3). These models include all four
occupations, with dummy variables for each occupation and
interaction variables between each occupation and each
WTC variable, to allow me to explore the differentiated
effects of WTC on worker stress for different occupations. In
this kind of multiplicative interaction analysis, an "omitted"
or base category forms the basis for comparison (CNAs in
Models 9-11 and physicians in Model 12). Thus, the coeffi-
cient for the WTC variable that is included in the interaction
term (e.g., supervisor pressure in Model 9) reflects the effect
of this variable on job stress only for the base occupation
(e.g., in Model 9, the coefficient of 0.227 reflects the rela-
tionship between supervisor pressure and job stress only
among CNAs). The coefficients for the interaction terms
(e.g., "Supervisor pressure × EMT") reflect the difference in
coefficient between the base occupation and the occupation
in the interaction term. A positive and significant interaction
term indicates a significantly stronger relationship between
that WTC variable and job stress for the occupation in that
interaction term than for the base occupation (e.g., in Model
9, nurses have a significantly stronger relationship between
supervisor pressure and job stress than do CNAs).
Worker job stress is an ordered categorical variable with-
out a fixed distance between categories. Thus, following
Long (2004), I used ordinal logistic regression, the recom-
mended model for this kind of variable (similar results were
found when the models were run as ordinary least squares
[OLS] regressions). To maintain sample size and statistical
power, I used multiple imputation (via chained equations; the
ICE command in Stata 12) to impute values for those that
were missing on several variables. To confirm that ordinal
logistic regression would be appropriate for the dependent
variable, I verified that the data do not violate the propor-
tional odds assumption using a likelihood ratio test (omodel
in Stata), which was nonsignificant (Institute for Digital
Research and Education, n.d.).
Results
These results show that WTC does have a significant impact
on worker well-being. Importantly, the findings also show
that different dimensions of WTC affect the four occupations
in distinctive ways, offering a corrective to prior work that
does not distinguish between workers who occupy different
locations in the system of social stratification.
Two WTC measures significantly affected all groups
except the CNAs: Feeling supervisor pressure to work more
hours significantly increased stress, whereas workers' per-
ceived ability to change their work schedules significantly
decreased stress among physicians, nurses, and EMTs
(Table 2). Some dimensions, however, affected only one
occupational group: Wanting to work fewer hours signifi-
cantly increased job-related stress only among CNAs,
whereas feeling able to "always" work extra hours signifi-
cantly increased job-related stress only among physicians.
When tested with an interaction model, this variation by occu-
pation was statistically significant only in the cases of the rela-
tionships between work-related stress and either supervisor
pressure or wanting fewer hours (see next section).
In the base model without WTC variables, partnership
and parental status was significantly associated with job
stress among CNAs and physicians. For CNAs, being a sin-
gle parent of young children was associated with the most
job stress of any of the partnership/parental status combina-
tions. CNA single parents' level of job stress was signifi-
cantly higher than that of CNAs who were single and had no
children or had older children. Among physicians, those who
were married or partnered with young children reported sig-
nificantly less job stress than single physicians with either no
children or older children. Interestingly, when WTC vari-
ables are added to the model, the significant effect of partner-
ship and parental status disappears for CNAs but intensifies
for physicians.

Occupation-Specific Relationships
The two significant results in Table 3 (Models 9 and 10)
reveal the unique circumstances of CNAs. One shows no
relationship for CNAs between one aspect of WTC (supervi-
sor pressure) and job stress where the other occupations did,
and another result shows a significant relationship for CNAs
between job stress and a different aspect of WTC (hours mis-
match) where other occupations did not. Table 3 contains
four models with interaction terms--one for each WTC vari-
able. Only the first two (Models 9 and 10) show statistically
significant differences between occupations in the WTC­job
stress relationship.
Supervisor pressure (Model 9).CNAs are the only occupa-
tional group for whom there is not a significant relationship
between increasing supervisor pressure to work more hours
and job stress (Table 2, Model 2; Table 3, Model 9). The
positive and significant interaction term for nurses in Model
9 indicates that, for them, supervisor pressure has a signifi-
cantly stronger relationship to job stress than for CNAs.
Figure 1 illustrates these different relationships using pre-
dicted probabilities of a worker agreeing that their job causes
them stress for varying levels of supervisor pressure. As
supervisor pressure to work more hours increases, so does
the probability of workers agreeing that their job wears them
out for all occupations except for CNAs. The difference
between CNAs and the other occupations in the relationship
between supervisor pressure and job stress can be seen in the
relative flatness of the slope of the CNA line compared with
those of the three other occupations.
Worker expectations for autonomy might be one possible
explanation for this finding. This variable captured workers'
perceived ability to self-determine their schedules. As the
least powerful occupation out of the four studied, CNAs may
have lower expectations than the other three occupations
for their level of discretion at their workplace and thus not
experience greater stress when pressured by a supervisor.
Alternatively, the chronic underemployment of CNAs--who
are often seeking additional hours to have the income to pay
their bills--might make supervisor pressure to work more
hours a lesser source of job stress than, say, supervisor
pressure to cut hours (Kahn, 2006).
Hours mismatch (Model 10).Among CNAs, there was a
uniquely significant relationship between wanting to work
fewer hours and job stress, different from all the other three
occupations. CNAs who want to work fewer hours than they
currently work reported significantly more job stress than
those CNAs who wanted the same or more hours than they
were working. This association was small and nonsignificant
for the other three occupations (Table 2). The negative and
significant interaction terms in Model 10 (Table 3) show that
the relationship between wanting fewer hours and increased

job stress was significantly weaker among the other three
occupations than for CNAs. Figure 2 presents a visual illus-
tration of these differences. The line marking the drop in
stress between workers who want to work fewer hours and
those who want the same or more hours is markedly steeper
for CNAs than for any of the other occupations.
Hours mismatch captures an aspect of WTC related to
workers' ability to recover from work through time away
from work and their ability to balance work and nonwork
obligations--related to both time and money. Workers across
class social locations report hours mismatches in the litera-
ture, but higher status and lower status workers tend to lack
control over this aspect of scheduling in opposite ways.
Middle- and upper-class workers tend to report excessive
hours whereas lower-class workers tend to report deficient
hours (Lyness et al., 2012). Thus, for higher wage workers, a
sense of control is often more closely tied to being able to
limit one's hours, whereas for lower wage workers, a sense
of control might emerge instead from being able to acquire
enough hours to meet financial needs.
The unique salience of hours mismatches for CNAs may
be due to their unique position of marginalization compared
with the other occupations. Physicians and EMTs who want
to cut back on their hours might be buffered from the stress
of overwork by other mechanisms, such as the satisfaction of
fitting in with the social norm of breadwinning. Nurses--
who face similarly gendered time demands as CNAs--may
also have greater material resources (because of their own
wages and those of their partners) with which to deal with
excessive work hours. Although more research is needed to
investigate this unique relationship among CNAs, the find-
ings here suggest that these workers' exceptionally draining
work experience results from a combination of an inability to
cut back on hours of strenuous, low-paid work and having
little social or financial buffer with which to cope with this
lack of control.
Discussion and Conclusion
This study analyzes the relationship between WTC and
worker well-being in the context of specific occupations that
are shaped by class, gender, and race. It teases apart both the
different relationships between control and distress across
occupational ecologies and the different aspects of WTC that
might be relevant in each of those settings. The results sug-
gest that the buffering effects of WTC depend on a match
between the specific aspect of control and the kinds of
demands workers face, both of which depend on occupa-
tional context. Importantly, this project's results also cor-
roborate previous work that finds beneficial effects for
worker well-being of worker-controlled scheduling flexibility
(e.g., the ability to leave work early to pick up a sick child),
rather than the kind of employer-controlled flexibility (e.g.,
calling people in or sending them home on short notice) that
often creates unpredictability in workers'schedules (e.g., see

This study's findings of the unique time control needs
among CNAs illustrate why attention to particular aspects of
WTC in specific occupational contexts is important. CNAs
are the most socially marginal group of workers examined in
this study. They are the lowest paid, are predominantly
female, and have an overrepresentation of women of color.
At this intersection of race and gender, workers are dispro-
portionately likely to be employed in low-wage work (Jensen
& Slack, 2003) and thus more likely than those in higher
wage occupations to seek additional work hours to meet
basic family financial needs (Geiger-Brown, Muntaner,
Lipscomb, & Trinkoff, 2004; Jacobs & Gerson, 2004). These
financial pressures may be especially acute for CNAs, many
of whom are single parents or the sole or primary earners in
their households (Kahn, 2006; Rakovski & Price-Glynn,
2009). Attention to occupational context is critical to illumi-
nating how the struggles of socially marginalized workers,
such as CNAs, are compounded by the limited control this
article elucidates.
The financial exigencies that go into work hours calcula-
tions for CNAs are emphasized by our finding that (a) for
these workers alone, the desire to cut back on hours was a
significant predictor of stress but (b) supervisor pressure to
work additional hours had no relationship with job stress. In
other words, something other than supervisor pressure keeps
CNAs who are overworked in that situation. In interviews
from the larger study of which this article is a part, CNAs
were torn between the trade-off between time and money
embedded in this kind of hours mismatch. They simultane-
ously worried about not working enough to support their
families financiallyand also about not spending enough time
with their families. Unlike nurses, their wages were not suf-
ficient to make them comfortable choosing family time over
additional income. Although many workers struggle with
overwork, it seems that CNA's experience is exacerbated by
this sense of ambivalence and the limited resources they
might use to buffer themselves.
From this angle, looking at the case of CNAs suggests
some relatively straightforward--albeit politically charged--
solutions to improve conditions for these workers. Their fun-
damental bind is that their wages are too low to meet their
families' needs, but the very insufficiency of those wages
increases those needs, by requiring CNAs to maintain longer
paid work hours instead of having the time to, for example,
provide their own child care. When combined with employer-
controlled scheduling, these low wages leave CNAs in a par-
ticularly vulnerable position. CNAs report being regularly
assigned fewer weekly hours than they would prefer, leaving
them in a constant search for extra hours to add to their
schedules (Clawson & Gerstel, 2014). Employers save
money through this kind of lean staffing. Furthermore, by
keeping weekly hours low, employers create a pool of work-
ers eager for more hours--workers they can call in whenever
they need extra labor, but who will not earn overtime wages
when they pick up these extra shifts (Henly et al., 2006).
Raising wages, providing subsidized child care, and giv-
ing workers paid sick leave are solutions that would benefit
not only these health care workers but also those for whom
these workers are providing care (Gornick & Meyers, 2008).
Kahn (2006) reports that strict attendance requirements at
nursing homes lead some CNAs to "report to work when
they themselves are ill, sometimes with contagious illnesses,
in order to conserve possible discipline-incurring absences
for the occasions when they have sick children" (p. 105). In
the larger study, we found the same patterns (Clawson &
Gerstel, 2014). Despite the danger to patients, management
not only permitted this practice of showing up to work sick
but even indirectly encouraged it because it might save
money (Kahn, 2006). Thus, giving workers more control
over their time in the form of paid leave for "routine and non-
routine caregiving" (Gornick & Meyers, 2008) is not only
the right thing to do for low-wage workers, it also benefits
the people for whom these workers care.
In addition to paid family leave, free or subsidized child
care and preschool would help all workers, especially those
who are forced to choose between time to earn money (often
used to pay for child care) and time to spend with their chil-
dren. Because these workers are often women, such policies
would particularly help to address gender- and class-based
inequalities in terms of work time (Gornick & Meyers, 2008;
Williams, 2010). The United States, we should note, is shock-
ingly behind in this regard; ranking below most other devel-
oped nations in the provision of subsidized child care and pay
for care workers(Heymann, 2001; Kelly &Kalev, 2006).
Ultimately, worktime scheduling is a way that workers bal-
ance many competing demands in their lives. Thus, policy
can and should address not only workers' control over work
time itself but also the pulls of those competing demands such
as child care that are experienced by all workers.
Despite a political and economic climate that might seem
hostile to these worker-friendly policies, recent evidence
suggests cautious optimism. For example, although national
legislation on paid sick leave has proved elusive, states and
cities have recently begun to take action on the issue. In
2014, California and Massachusetts passed statewide paid
sick days laws, joining Connecticut (which passed the only
other statewide measure in 2011) and more than a dozen cit-
ies with such legislation (Ness, 2014). Movements toward a
higher minimum wage have also received widespread atten-
tion in recent years. In 2014, President Obama supported a
US$10.10 national minimum wage. In 2013 and 2014, 13
states increased their minimum wages, as did 10 city and
county governments. Seattle voted to raise its citywide mini-
mum to US$15 an hour by 2018 and the mayors of New
York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have all backed a US$13
wage floor. These actions are relevant to CNAs, whose
national median wage was US$11.73/hr in 2012 (Bureau of
Labor Statistics, 2014).
Many forms of worker organizinghave played a critical
role in advancing these demands for wages and benefits, and
14 SAGE Open
such organizing might be the most promising route to imple-
menting the kinds of changes in worktime policy outlined
here. Unions--such as Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) United Healthcare Workers--continue to
organize CNAs despite the obstacles created by employer
resistance to collective bargaining and a climate of relatively
high unemployment in the United States. Unionized CNAs
earn higher wages than their nonunionized counterparts
(Wicks-Lim, 2009). The faster-than-average job growth for
nursing assistants and the consequent shortage of skilled
long-term care workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014;
Stone & Harahan, 2010) would seem to put CNAs in a stron-
ger position to collectively organize; however, CNAs who
are members of a union remain a minority--only about 14%
of nursing assistants, nationally (Wicks-Lim, 2009).
Nevertheless, collective actions by low-wage workers
both inside and outside of union models have intensified and
gained national attention in recent years--most famously
among fast-food workers. Home health care workers (who
have roles similar to that of CNAs, but do not have the for-
mal training) have begun to join fast-food workers in these
widespread strikes and the only-slightly-less-marginal CNAs
might find inspiration in these kinds of actions. The case for
better working conditions for CNAs is bolstered by evidence
that nursing home resident well-being is greater where CNA
job satisfaction is higher (Bishop et al., 2008).
An alternative form of worker organization--worker-
owned businesses--also offers promise in terms of improv-
ing working conditions for workers such as CNAs by creating
structures that give workers control over the institutions that
affect their lives (Majee & Hoyt, 2010). The intimate nature
of their jobs leads care workers to feel a strong emotional
attachment to the work they do (Dodson & Zincavage, 2007;
Rakovski & Price-Glynn, 2009). Rather than allowing
employers to exploit this attachment as a means to motivate
an undercompensated workforce (Dodson & Zincavage,
2007), worker-owned care businesses can transform this
attachment into mutually-beneficial, patient-worker, busi-
ness models. Indeed, the worker-owner model for home
health care has been found to benefit both workers and cli-
ents (Majee & Hoyt, 2010). Further evidence of the potential
of worker-owned home health care cooperatives comes from
Bologna, Italy, where as much as 60% of home health care
services are provided by employee cooperatives (Logue,
2006). A handful of successful examples exist in the United
States (including Bronx-Based Cooperative Home Care
Associates, Home Care Associates in Philadelphia, and
Partners in Personal Assistance in Ann Arbor) and this prom-
ising model would benefit from additional research and
policy that supports funding and incubation.
Researchers concerned with the consequences of workers'
control over their work time must acknowledge long-
standing patterns of occupational segregation that leave
workers in different social locations with very different
needs and also very different resources on which to draw to
meet those needs. The variation found in this study in the
relationships between specific elements of WTC in specific
occupational contexts remind us that bringing an awareness
of stratification patterns into our research designs can create
opportunities to better understand workers' experiences.
Research has already begun to move in the direction of
disentangling subdimensions of WTC but could pay more
attention to the ways these aspects have different valences
across occupational ecologies.
Policymakers, too, should account for the ways work-
scheduling policies can have different implications for dif-
ferently situated workers. The contrasting pulls of overwork
felt by salaried workers and underemployment by hourly
workers suggest that maintaining such a system benefits
employers at the expense of all workers. Nevertheless,
choices between income and time are much more constrained
for some. Recently, a prominent worktime scholar (Schor,
2010) argued for distributing time in the labor market more
evenly--reducing labor market time for high-hours workers
to increase income for low-hours workers. Demands to redis-
tribute work time as a way of countering unemployment
and sharing the available wages arose during the Great
Depression, but such solutions have yet to be broached in the
current economic recovery (Negrey, 2012).
The negative impact that a lack of WTC can have on
workers' health and well-being should give us new impetus
to consider alternative and innovative solutions to worktime
regulation. Control, like other resources in society, is not dis-
tributed evenly across social locations. For the least powerful
workers, challenges to health and well-being due to a lack of
WTC promise to compound the disadvantages of their social
location and reinforce, even bolster, existing inequalities.
Limitations
Although this study makes important contributions to the
study of WTC and its consequences, it also has several
limitations. The cross-sectional, nonexperimental design
does not allow for causal conclusions. Reverse causality is a
possibility--that feeling control over work time is a result of
feeling less job-related stress. In their review, Hausser et al.
(2010) find that longitudinal studies showed weaker support
for the job-demand control model predicting job-related
well-being than did cross-sectional studies. Incorporating an
occupationally comparative model into future longitudinal
and experimental research designs might be a fruitful avenue
of research. A small sample size within each occupation also
limited statistical power in making comparisons. In addition,
although some might consider using single-item measures as
a limitation, it also leads to useful insights regarding the
different aspects of WTC that would otherwise be concealed
by combining these items into a scale.
Another limitation is that class and race are clearly entan-
gled in this study, as they are in American society. Without a
low-wage, predominantly female, and predominantly White
comparison group, I can only speculate about the ways
CNAs' racial composition contributes to the distinct
Stein 15
outcomes for that group. Also, as noted, Massachusetts has a
higher proportion of Whites in the workplace than the
national average. The results might have been different if
the study was based in a state with a higher population of
people of color.
EMTs and CNAs held second jobs at much higher rates
than physicians and nurses and worked significantly more
hours in those jobs than the other two occupations. Stress
levels in these second jobs are likely tied to stress levels in
primary jobs, and lacking a measure of "second job stress" is
a limitation of this study. However, holding a second job was
not a significant predictor of worker stress in our models.
The self-report nature of the data could also be seen as
problematic. But, as I was interested in workers' perceptions
of their own control and their own well-being, I felt that a
self-report measure was appropriate, especially because the
same measure was used across occupations. However,
the self-report nature of these measures raises some ques-
tions for future research. For example, to what degree do
worker expectations of control differentially impact their
self-assessment of stress? Also, how does attitude about
one's work affect that self-assessment? In other words, does
a sense of "doing good" buffer workers from feeling stressed
about a lack of control over their work time?
