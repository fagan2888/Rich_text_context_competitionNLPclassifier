Homocysteine levels are associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in observational studies. Lead and
cadmium are risk factors for PAD that affect thiol metabolism, and they may partly explain the association of
homocysteine with PAD. To evaluate the roles of lead and cadmium exposure in confounding the association
between homocysteine and PAD, the authors performed a cross-sectional study among 4,447 persons aged 40
years who participated in the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). PAD was
defined as an ankle-brachial blood pressure index less than 0.90 in at least one leg. After adjustment for socio-
demographic variables, the odds ratio for PAD in the highest quintile of homocysteine compared with the lowest
was 1.92 (ptrend
¼ 0.004). Adjusting for blood lead and cadmium levels reduced this odds ratio to 1.37 (ptrend
¼
0.13), and further adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking reduced it to 0.89 (ptrend
¼ 0.87).
Adjustment for other risk factors did not affect this association. In the general population, the association of
homocysteine level with PAD can be completely explained by confounding due to smoking, increased blood lead
and cadmium levels, and impaired renal function. The association of lead and cadmium with PAD risk deserves
further investigation.

In observational studies, elevated homocysteine levels are
associated with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (1­4), of-
ten more strongly than with other cardiovascular disease
endpoints (1). As a consequence, the possibility of prevent-
ing PAD through homocysteine-lowering interventions has
received substantial attention, based on the assumption that
the association between homocysteine and PAD is causal
and not just a marker of the effect of other etiologic agents.
Randomized trials, however, have shown no effect of homo-
cysteine-lowering interventions on cardiovascular outcomes
(5, 6). Although these trials did not assess PAD specifically,
they suggest the possibility that previously unidentified con-
founders may account for the association of homocysteine
with PAD.
Elevated lead and cadmium levels are risk factors for
PAD (7) and other cardiovascular disease endpoints (8, 9).
Lead and cadmium are divalent cations with high affinity for
thiol groups (10­13), an action that could affect homocys-
teine metabolism. Schafer et al. (14) recently identified an
association between homocysteine level and blood lead
level among participants in the Baltimore Memory Study.
These findings prompted us to evaluate the associations

between lead, cadmium, and homocysteine as a potential
explanation for the results of observational studies of homo-
cysteine and PAD.
We used 1999­2002 data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to systematically
evaluate the roles of traditional and nontraditional risk fac-
tors, including lead and cadmium exposure, in confounding
the association between homocysteine and reduced ankle-
brachial blood pressure index, a specific marker of PAD
commonly used in epidemiologic studies (15, 16).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
NHANES is a series of cross-sectional surveys that have
been conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
since the 1960s to obtain health and nutrition data in sam-
ples selected to represent the civilian, noninstitutionalized
US population. In 1999, NHANES became a continuous
survey, and the National Center for Health Statistics started
to measure ankle-brachial index in men and women aged
40 years (17, 18). The response rate for the physical ex-
amination component of NHANES 1999­2002 was 76 per-
cent. In the present analysis, we used data from NHANES
1999­2002 participants who were eligible for measurement
of ankle-brachial index (n ¼ 5,965). We restricted our study
to the 4,874 participants with valid measures of ankle-
brachial index, plasma homocysteine level, and blood lead
and cadmium levels (81.7 percent of eligible participants).
We further excluded 23 subjects with an ankle-brachial
index value greater than 1.5 (often related to calcified,
noncompressible vessels in the legs (15)) and 404 partici-
pants (8.2 percent) with missing information on at least one
covariate of interest. This left 4,447 persons in the study
sample.
Variables
Plasma homocysteine. Blood was drawn and processed
in NHANES mobile examination centers according to stan-
dard protocols (17, 18). Plasma samples were frozen in the
field, shipped on dry ice, and stored at ÿ70°C. Total homo-
cysteine concentration in plasma was measured using a fully
automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Abbott
Homocysteine Assay; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
Illinois) at the NHANES Central Laboratory (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia). Plasma
levels were calculated using a machine-stored calibration
curve (Abbott IMx analyzer in 1999­2001 and Abbott
AxSYM analyzer starting in 2002; Abbott Laboratories). The
fluorescence polarization immunoassay method is equiva-
lent to high performance liquid chromatography (19). The
analytical laboratory followed extensive quality control pro-
cedures (17, 18). Since standard reference materials are not
available for homocysteine assays, bench quality control
pools with low, medium, and high levels of homocysteine
were prepared at the NHANES Central Laboratory. The
pools were analyzed in duplicate during each run and used
for calibration and calibration verification procedures. The
interassay coefficients of variation ranged from 2.7 percent
to 3.4 percent.
Blood lead and cadmium. Blood for lead and cadmium
measurements was collected in ordinary tubes after confir-
mation of no background contamination in all collection and
storage materials. Lead and cadmium levels in whole blood
were measured with a PerkinElmer model SIMAA 6000
simultaneous multielement atomic absorption spectrometer
(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Wellesley,
Massachusetts) with Zeeman background correction (17,
18). The detection limits were 0.3 lg/dl for lead and 0.3
lg/liter for cadmium. There were 11 participants with levels
below the detection limit for lead and 731 (16 percent) with
levels below the limit for cadmium. For these participants,
we imputed a level equal to the detection limit divided by
the square root of 2 (20). National Institute of Standards and
Technology whole-blood standard reference materials were
used for external calibration. The interassay coefficients of
variation ranged from 3.1 percent to 4.0 percent for lead and
from 4.1 percent to 7.3 percent for cadmium.
Peripheral arterial disease. A specific protocol was used
to measure ankle-brachial index in NHANES 1999­2002
(17, 18). The measurements of blood pressure used for ankle-
brachial index were different from the measurements of
blood pressure used to define hypertension. Supine systolic
blood pressure was measured on the right arm (brachial
artery) and on both ankles (posterior tibial arteries) using
a Doppler device (Parks Mini-Lab IV, model 3100; Parks
Medical Electronics, Aloha, Oregon). If the participant had
a condition that would interfere with blood pressure reading
in the right arm, the left arm was used. Systolic blood pres-
sure was measured twice at each site for participants aged
40­59 years and once at each site for participants aged
60 years or more. Measurements for left and right ankle-
brachial index were obtained by dividing the mean ankle
systolic blood pressure on each side by the mean bra-
chial systolic blood pressure. PAD was defined as an ankle-
brachial index less than 0.90 in at least one leg.
Other variables. Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education, smoking, and alcohol consumption was based
on self-report. Body mass index was calculated by divid-
ing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Hy-
pertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure
140 mmHg, mean diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg,
a self-reported physician diagnosis, or self-reported medica-
tion use. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as total choles-
terol level 240 mg/dl (6.2 mmol/liter), a self-reported
physician diagnosis, or medication use. Diabetes was de-
fined as fasting glucose level 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/liter),
nonfasting glucose level 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter),
a self-reported physician diagnosis, or self-reported medi-
cation use.
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using
a Dade Behring Nephelometer II analyzer (Dade Behring,
Inc., Deerfield, Illinois). Serum creatinine concentration was
measured by means of the modified kinetic method of
Jaffe
´ (21), using a Hitachi model 704 multichannel analyzer
(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana).
Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated from

creatinine, age, sex, and race/ethnicity using the Modifica-
tion of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula (21). Serum
folate and vitamin B12
levels were measured at the NHANES
Central Laboratory using the Bio-Rad Quantaphase II folate/
vitamin B12
radioassay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
California) (17).
Statistical analysis
We performed all statistical analyses using the survey
weights and the svy commands in Stata, version 8.0 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas) to account for the com-
plex sampling design and weighting in NHANES 1999­2002
and to obtain appropriate standard errors for all estimates.
Data on homocysteine, lead, and cadmium levels were right-
skewed and were log-transformed for statistical analyses.
Quintile cutoffs were based on weighted distributions in the
whole study sample.
First we investigated the association of homocysteine with
lead and cadmium levels in a linear model with log homo-
cysteine used as the dependent variable and quintiles of lead
or cadmium used as independent variables. These models
estimate the adjusted ratio of the geometric mean homo-
cysteine value for a given quintile to the reference quintile.
We obtained p values for linear trend by including log-
transformed levels of homocysteine, lead, and cadmium as
continuous variables in the regression models. Restricted
cubic splines were also used to estimate nonlinear dose-
response relations between levels of homocysteine and lev-
els of lead and cadmium.
Second, we investigated the association between ho-
mocysteine and the prevalence of PAD using logistic regres-
sion. The primary objective of this analysis was to assess
whether this association could be explained by confounding
due to lead, cadmium, or other cardiovascular risk factors.
We used four levels of adjustment: Model 1 adjusted for
sociodemographic variables; model 2 further adjusted for
body mass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, dia-
betes, C-reactive protein, and serum folate and vitamin B12
.
Model 3 additionally adjusted for lead and cadmium, and
model 4 additionally adjusted for smoking and estimated
glomerular filtration rate. The impact of adjusting for lead,
cadmium, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and smoking
was also assessed by adding each variable and each com-
bination of variables to model 2. We obtained p values for
linear trend by including log-transformed variables as con-
tinuous variables in the regression models.
RESULTS
The geometric mean levels of homocysteine, lead, and
cadmium were 8.41 lmol/liter, 1.94 lg/dl, and 0.47 lg/liter,
respectively. Men had higher homocysteine and lead levels
than women. Homocysteine, lead, and cadmium levels all
increased with age. Compared with Whites, Blacks and
Mexican Americans had higher lead levels and Mexican
Americans had lower homocysteine levels. Lead and cad-
mium were also lower with higher education. Compared
with never smokers, current smokers had higher levels of
homocysteine, lead, and cadmium (data not shown).

Lead and cadmium were positively associated with
homocysteine (table 1). After adjustment for demographic
variables, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index,
C-reactive protein, serum folate, serum vitamin B12
, and
blood cadmium, participants in the highest quintile of lead
had 12 percent higher homocysteine levels than partici-
pants in the lowest quintile (ptrend
< 0.001). Similarly, par-
ticipants in the highest quintile of cadmium had 9 percent
higher homocysteine levels than those in the lowest quintile
(ptrend
< 0.001). In dose-response analysis, the associations
of homocysteine with lead and cadmium were progressive
throughout the range of exposure (figure 1).
The weighted prevalence of PAD in the study sample was
4.8 percent (standard error, 0.3 percent). Homocysteine was
significantly higher in PAD cases than in noncases (geomet-
ric mean values were 10.1 lmol/liter and 8.3 lmol/liter, re-
spectively; p < 0.001 (table 2)). After adjustment for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, and education, therewas a progressive
increase in PAD prevalence across quintiles of homocysteine
(table 3, model 1). The odds ratio for PAD in the highest
quintile of homocysteine as compared with the lowest quin-
tile was 1.92 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.95,
3.88). Adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholes-
terolemia, body mass index, C-reactive protein, alcohol in-
take, and serum folate and vitamin B12
did not materially
affect this association (table 3, model 2). In contrast, adjust-
ment for lead and cadmium reduced the adjusted odds ratio
for PAD in the highest homocysteine quintile versus the
lowest to 1.37 (95 percent CI: 0.58, 3.21) (table 3, model 3).
After adjustment for smoking and estimated glomerular
filtration rate, the odds ratio for PAD in the highest quintile
of homocysteine compared with the lowest quintile de-
creased further to 0.89 (95 percent CI: 0.35, 2.26) (table 3,
model 4). After adjustment, homocysteine was not associ-
ated with PAD in any subgroup of participants (figure 2).
When estimated glomerular filtration rate and smoking
were each added individually to model 2, the respective
odds ratios for PAD in the highest homocysteine quintile
versus the lowest were 1.27 (95 percent CI: 0.50, 3.23)
and 1.65 (95 percent CI: 0.71, 1.75), respectively. After
adjustment for metals and estimated glomerular filtration
rate, this odds ratio was 0.92 (95 percent CI: 0.36, 2.35),
very similar to the results from model 4.
The association of lead or cadmium with PAD, however,
was only modestly affected by adjustment for homocysteine
(table 3, model 3). Adjusting for homocysteine changed the
odds ratio for PAD in the highest quintile of lead compared
with the lowest from 2.36 (ptrend
< 0.001) to 2.20 (ptrend
¼
0.002). For cadmium, the odds ratio changed from 2.93
(ptrend
< 0.001) to 2.77 (ptrend
< 0.001). After further adjust-
ment for smoking and estimated glomerular filtration rate,
the PAD odds ratio for the highest quintile versus the lowest
was 1.65 for lead (ptrend
¼ 0.045) and 1.86 for cadmium
(ptrend
¼ 0.085).
DISCUSSION
In this large cross-sectional study in the general popula-
tion, homocysteine, lead, and cadmium were each associ-
ated with the prevalence of PAD in a dose-response fashion.
However, adjustment for blood lead and cadmium, esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate, and smoking completely
eliminated the association of homocysteine with PAD, while

the association of lead and cadmium with PAD persisted
after adjustment for homocysteine. The associations of lead
and cadmium with homocysteine and PAD are remarkable,
since they occurred at low levels of both metals, well below
current regulatory standards. For instance, only 54 partici-
pants (1.2 percent) had blood lead levels above 10 lg/dl
(23), and only two participants had levels above the Occu-
pational Safety and Health Administration standard (<40
lg/dl) (24). Similarly, only four participants had cadmium
levels above the Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration standard (<5 lg/liter) (25).
Lead and cadmium are widespread environmental toxi-
cants. Since the ban on leaded gasoline was instituted over
two decades ago, lead exposure in the United States has de-
clined substantially (26), but it still occurs in many occupa-
tional and environmental settings. People can be exposed to
lead through industrial and combustion sources, contact with
lead dusts and soils, certain foods, smoking, and sometimes
drinking water (27). Exposure to cadmium in the general
population results from exposure to cigarette smoke, inha-
lation of ambient air near coal-fired power plants and mu-
nicipal waste incinerators, and consumption of some foods
(the highest levels are found in shellfish, liver, kidney meats,
and crops grown in cadmium-rich soils) (28).
The association of lead and cadmium with homocysteine
that we observed in NHANES 1999­2002 confirms the find-
ings of the Baltimore Memory Study (14). The association
was independent of well-known determinants of homocys-
teine level, including folate and vitamin B12
. Because our
study was cross-sectional, it does not provide information
on the mechanisms involved in the association of homocys-
teine with lead and cadmium, and we can only speculate as
to the causes. Lead and cadmium induce changes in gluta-
thione metabolism (12, 29), which may result in increased
demand for cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid in the bio-
synthesis of glutathione. Lead also inhibits heme synthesis
(12), which is essential to the activity of cystathionine-b-
synthase, the rate-limiting step in the conversion of ho-
mocysteine to cysteine. In addition, lead and cadmium can
affect absorption, carrier protein binding, and tissue distri-
bution of iron and zinc--important metals needed for the
metabolism of homocysteine (30).
Lead and cadmium were associated with PAD in this
study even after adjustment for homocysteine level. Many
investigators have reported that small elevations in blood
lead are associated with increased blood pressure, particu-
larly at low lead levels (31­33), and elevated blood lead has
also been associated with cardiovascular endpoints in pro-
spective studies (8, 9). Cadmium, although less well studied,
has been associated with myocardial infarction (34, 35).
Both metals increase oxidative stress (11), deplete glutathi-
one and protein-bound thiol groups (11), and induce the

production of inflammatory cytokines (36) and endothelial
dysfunction (37), but the precise mechanisms responsible
for their cardiovascular effects at the low doses observed
in this study are unknown. Mechanistic studies at low levels
of exposure and prospective studies in humans using appro-
priate biomarkers of chronic exposure are needed to further
characterize the role of metals in atherosclerosis.
A key causal issue is whether the association of lead or
cadmium with PAD is itself a reflection of confounding by
impaired renal function. The evidence indicates that in-
creased levels of lead and cadmium are the cause, rather than
the consequence, of declining renal function (38, 39). In
several studies, patients with chronic kidney disease or
end-stage renal disease of known etiology did not have in-
creased levels of blood lead (40, 41), bone lead (40­42), or
bone cadmium (42). In contrast, increased body lead bur-
den has been associated with impaired renal function and
nephropathy in subjects with occupational lead exposure
(43­45), childhood lead poisoning (46, 47), gout (41, 48),
and essential hypertension (40, 41) and in middle-aged and
elderly men without previously known heavy lead exposure
(49). In one study, high-normal levels of chelatable lead
predicted renal function decline in patients with chronic
renal insufficiency (50). Furthermore, chelation therapy
improved renal function in these patients and slowed the
progression of renal insufficiency (50). Thus, impaired renal
function is likely to be an intermediate variable, rather
than a confounder, for the association of lead or cadmium
with PAD.
Smoking and impaired renal function are established
causes of PAD and of increased homocysteine levels (51­
53). Although adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration
rate and smoking substantially reduced the association be-
tween homocysteine and PAD, additional adjustment for
lead and cadmium further reduced this association. The im-
portance of each of these confounders may differ across
populations as a function of their prevalence. While previ-
ous studies of homocysteine and PAD have adjusted for
smoking, few have adjusted for markers of renal function,
and none (to our knowledge) have adjusted for lead or cad-
mium levels.
The hypothesis that homocysteine is a cardiovascular
disease risk factor originated from the clinical observa-
tion that patients with genetic defects leading to very high

Lead, Homocysteine, and Peripheral Arterial Disease 705
Am J Epidemiol 2006;163:700­708
homocysteine levels in blood and homocystinuria had pre-
mature atherosclerosis. Our study does not contradict the
possibility that high homocysteine concentrations contribute
to atherosclerosis, but in our general population sample,
homocysteine levels were low (the 90th percentile of homo-
cysteine in the NHANES sample was 12.4 lmol/liter). In
this context, our findings indicate that the homocysteine ele-
vations observed among PAD cases were more likely to be
a consequence of their association with lead and cadmium
exposure, impaired renal function, and smoking rather than
a cause of PAD. Thus, adjustment for these variables is
needed in order to avoid confounding of the association be-
tween homocysteine level and PAD.
Perhaps the most significant limitation of our study is the
cross-sectional nature of NHANES data. However, most
studies of homocysteine and PAD are either cross-sectional
or case-control in nature and share common design lim-
itations with our study. Furthermore, cross-sectional and
retrospective designs, if anything, tend to overestimate the
association of homocysteine with cardiovascular endpoints
(54). It is thus unlikely that the lack of association of homo-
cysteine with PAD after multivariate adjustment is due to
biases in cross-sectional study designs.
Interpretation of our findings is limited by a lack of un-
derstanding of the mechanism underlying the association of
lead or cadmium with homocysteine. While lead and cad-
mium may affect homocysteine levels, it is also possible that
homocysteine affects blood lead or cadmium levels. Homo-
cysteine has a thiol group and is similar in structure to pen-
icillamine and dimercaptosuccinic acid (55), two chelating
agents used to enhance urinary excretion of lead. Homo-
cysteine could shift the equilibrium of heavy metals across
different compartments by such binding, and this could re-
sult in an association between serum homocysteine and
blood lead. In fact, high metal concentrations in blood, hair,
and urine have been observed in homocystinuric patients
(56), although the relevance of this finding to the much
lower homocysteine levels observed in the general popula-
tion is unknown.
The strengths of our study include the rigorous sampling
design and quality control of NHANES, the representative
nature of the study sample, the large sample size, and the use
of standardized measures of ankle-brachial index.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that previous studies
may have overestimated the association between homocys-
teine and PAD because of confounding by lead and cad-
mium exposure. Even more important, our results agree
with an increasing body of evidence indicating that expo-
sure to even low concentrations of these metals may have
important cardiovascular effects. Because of the widespread
exposure to lead and cadmium at the levels that were as-
sociated with PAD in our study, identifying the precise
mechanisms of effect and determining their role in other
cardiovascular outcomes should be a research priority.
