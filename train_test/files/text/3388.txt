Journal of Police Emergency Response - Original Manuscript
Introduction
In addition to the ever-present threat of external traumatic events
and violence on the street, there is a secondary, less recognized
psychological threat, and invisible assassin, that can be just as
deadly for peace officers; traumatic stress. (Capt. Greg Davis,

The Unique Job of First Responders:
Oscillating Between Life Threat and
Ethics of Care
Most people, if asked about the actual work involved in
being a police officer, firefighter, or an emergency medical
services (EMS) worker, would probably suggest that police
work mainly focuses on crime investigations, patrol, and
arrest of criminals; that a firefighter's work is primarily
related to extinguishing fires; and that the EMS worker's job
is aimed at providing first aid services. Nevertheless, the
reality of what first responders' work entails is more com-
plex than many people may presume. Undeniably, police
officers are often crime fighters and, as such, they are sworn
and mandated to respond to virulent crimes (i.e., terrorism
attacks, murders) and arrest the criminal(s) (Haugen, Evces,
& Weiss, 2012). Similarly, firefighters are mandated to
respond, among other things, to residential and commercial
fires, explosions, spills, and large-scale natural disasters (Del
Ben, Scotti, Chen, & Fortson, 2006). Analogously, EMS
workers are trained to respond to a variety of emergency situ-
ations, medical crises, and community disasters, to name but

Examining the Psychophysiological
Efficacy of CBT Treatment for First
Responders Diagnosed With PTSD: An
Understudied Topic
Konstantinos Papazoglou1
Abstract
First responders are often exposed to multiple potentially traumatic incidents over the course of their career. However,
scientific research showed that first responders are more resilient compared with the general population. In addition,
experience of life-threatening situations and acute stress may lead first responders to the development of posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) or posttraumatic stress symptoms. Current clinical research and practice has developed evidence-
based treatments shown to be effective in helping first responders ameliorate their PTSD symptoms and perform their
duties effectively. Literature showed that cognitive­behavioral therapy (CBT) entails multiple evidence-based techniques
that lead those suffering from PTSD toward symptom improvement and trauma recovery. The current article aims to (a)
provide readers with rigorous information about stress and trauma experienced by first responders, (b) present PTSD
symptomatology as well as risk and protective PTSD factors prevalent among first responders, (c) provide information about
the psychophysiology of PTSD, and (d) explore the efficacy of CBT treatment for first responders diagnosed with PTSD. The
author highlights the necessity for psychophysiological measurement of CBT treatment efficacy for first responders diagnosed
with PTSD; also, potential gaps in the current scientific literature regarding this issue are highlighted. Recommendations for
future research and clinical practice are discussed so that health professionals and researchers continue to serve those who
serve our communities.

a few of the critical situations in which they may find them-
selves (Corneil, Beaton, Murphy, Johnson, & Pike, 1999;
Van der Ploeg & Kleber, 2003).Apart from the importance of
their own bodily survival on the street, the value of "hero-
ism" in the first responders'subcultures is salient, because its
members are expected to approach situations and be pre-
pared to sacrifice their lives where average individuals would
have escaped (Lucas & Kline, 2008). For instance, during
the 9/11 terrorist attacks, firefighters and police officers,
risking their own lives, entered in and stayed in the ready-to-
collapse buildings to save civilians who were otherwise
unable to escape; they remained in the buildings saving civil-
ians until the buildings collapsed on them (Dwyer &
O'Donnell, 2005).
Notwithstanding, the other side of the coin reveals that
first responders often support victims of crimes (i.e., abused
children, battered women) as well as victims of natural disas-
ters and accidents, being more often among the first respond-
ers present at the crime scene (Andersen, Papazoglou,
Arnetz, & Collins, 2015; May & Wisco, 2016). For instance,
when the mass school shooting occurred in Newtown,
Connecticut, first responders were the first present at the
scene (Draznin, 2013). As a result, they were the ones hold-
ing the wounded children and providing them with first aid
as well as psychological support. What many may--con-
sciously or unconsciously--ignore, is that first responders
are exposed to a plethora of life-threatening and potentially
traumatic situations--over the course of their careers.
Therefore, what makes first responders' work unique is that
they are expected to diligently maintain a dual role, oscillat-
ing between "critical incident responder" and "social service
worker" (Manzella & Papazoglou, 2014). Some police psy-
chologists and scholars have argued that first responders may
encounter--not surprisingly--hundreds of potentially trau-
matic events during their careers (Rudofossi, 2009).
Psychological Trauma Among First
Responders
Psychological trauma refers to any sudden, uncontrollable,
and disruptive incident that negatively affects one's physical,
emotional, behavioral, and cognitive processes, and conse-
quently, that may beget various forms of psychopathology
(i.e., posttraumatic stress reaction, major depression; Van der
Kolk, 2003). The origin of the term trauma can be traced back
to the Greek word "" or "" which literally
means "to wound" (Oxford English Online Dictionary, 2015).
In the area of psychological trauma, the etymology of the
verb "to wound" insinuates the "psychological wounds" that
may emanate from exposure to any traumatic incident.
Psychological research of the impact of trauma on police offi-
cers has shown that the experience of trauma may be debili-
tating for first responders' physical (i.e., high blood pressure,
cardiovascular diseases) and psychological health (i.e., anxi-
ety disorder, depression) over the course of their careers
(Miller, 2000; Stephens, Long, & Miller, 1997; Violanti et al.,
2006). Furthermore, exposure to traumatic incidents may
aversely affect first responders' behavior (i.e., impatience,
anger outbursts), cognitive processes (i.e., memory, informa-
tion processing), and emotional reactivity to daily life (i.e.,
sadness, feeling like a failure; Andersen et al., 2015). As
aforementioned, trauma experience by first responders is
cumulative, long term, and complex (Papazoglou, 2013,
2016). The complexity of first responders' trauma refers to
the fact that first responders may experience trauma directly
(i.e., loss of a partner) or indirectly (i.e., by asking a victim of
abuse to describe what happened; May & Wisco, 2016).
Among first responders, trauma is often experienced through
some or all the human senses. For instance, a life-threatening
situation (i.e., shooting) experienced by a police officer in the
line of duty, may involve the following senses: sight (officer
was at the incident), sound (officer listened to the sounds of
shots being fired), smell (officer smelt the smoke of the firing
bullet), and touch (officer held the weapon during the inci-
dent). It is possible that either direct or indirect exposure to
potentially traumatic incidents may lead first responders to
the experience of many incapacitating mental and physical
health-related conditions (Marmar et al., 2006; May & Wisco,
2016; Pietrzak et al., 2014). Furthermore, exposure to poten-
tially traumatic incidents may lead to the onset of PTSD
(Donnelly, 2011; May & Wisco, 2016).
In the scholarly literature, it is appeared that trauma expe-
rienced between first responders and military personnel has
certain commonalities as well as distinctions. Both first
responders and military personnel are exposed to numerous
potentially traumatic incidents during their career on the
grounds that they often respond to violent incidents, and are
even prepared to sacrifice their own lives for social welfare
and freedom. Furthermore, both military personnel and first
responders may vicariously experience trauma and loss
when, for instance, their comrades (or colleagues) are
wounded or even die; also, they may often support civilians
who have been wounded or lost family members and friends
by deplorable actions (e.g., terrorist attacks, crimes; Walker,
McKune, Ferguson, Pyne, & Rattray, 2016). Nevertheless,
there are some distinct differences between military and first
responders' trauma. Military personnel may be exposed to
horrific incidents in the combat zone; however, exposure to
such incidents is expected to end upon completion of deploy-
ment and return to their home country. However, first
responders serve for almost three decades, and exposure to
potentially traumatic incidents (even though as intense as in
the combat zone) may occur any time until retirement
(Papazoglou, 2013, 2016). In addition, experience of death,
killings, and violent situations is more prominent and fre-
quent among military personnel who are deployed in the
combat zone (Litz et al., 2009; Shay, 2014). In contrast, first
responders are mandated to maintain peace and order in the
communities they serve and may often experience satisfac-
tion in the line of duty by supporting traumatized individuals

The Enemy Within the "Fortress":
PTSD Among First Responders
PTSD Diagnosis and Symptomatology
The scientific literature emphasizes the complex nature of
PTSD among first responders following exposure to traumatic
incidents (Donnelly, 2011; Fushimi, 2012; MacDonald,
Colotla, Flamer, & Karlinsky, 2003; Skogstad et al., 2013).
The complexity of PTSD among first responders derives from
the fact that first responders may experience multiple trau-
matic incidents over the course of their careers (Papazoglou,
2013, 2016; Papazoglou & Andersen, 2014). These incidents
may vary in terms of their intensity, frequency, and level of life
threat that may entail against first responders. For instance,
Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) officers may be exposed
to hundreds of potentially life-threatening situations over the
course of their career. Also, an officer who serves in a child
exploitation unit is probably exposed to a plethora of cases of
abused children over a calendar year. The author posits that
what renders first responders' trauma idiosyncratic compared
with the general public who may or may not experience trauma
is the exposure to a myriad of life-threatening situations that
may be present (e.g., violent criminal shoots a cop) or eminent
(e.g., officers respond to a domestic violence call). However,
researchers found that increased number of deployment tours
of military personnel in the combat zone is related to higher
risk of PTSD development because exposure to potentially
traumatic incidents is accumulated over multiple deployments
(Conard & Sauls, 2014; Reger, Gahm, Swanson, & Duma,
2009). The American Psychiatric Association (APA; 1980)
defined trauma as a horrific event that is beyond the scope of
the normal human experience. More specifically, a person
experiencing trauma is likely to perceive the incident as life
threatening, leading to the experience of helplessness, fear,
horror, or disgust. However, one needs to consider certain
parameters to define an event as traumatic (Greenwald, 2007;
Weathers, Marx, Friedman, & Schnurr, 2014). The severity
and personal impact of the event appear to be the most impor-
tant factors in the consideration of an event as traumatic. For
instance, during the Holocaust, millions of people were killed
(severity of event) and many survivors lost their family mem-
bers and their friends (personal impact of the event). Other
parameters may also be related to the proximity of the experi-
ence and the after-event impact (Greenwald, 2007; Weathers
et al., 2014). For instance, a family may have experienced a
natural catastrophe (i.e., earthquake) and, as a result of the
natural catastrophe, find themselves homeless (after-event
impact). In addition, first responders may experience trauma
directly or indirectly. In the first case, an officer, for instance,
may experience a life-threatening situation (e.g., shooting) in
the line of duty. In the second case, first responders may
experience trauma indirectly when, for instance, they respond
to critical incidents and they support traumatized individuals.
This type of indirect traumatization among frontline profes-
sionals has received considerable attention in research. To this
end, Figley (1995, 2002) has coined the term "compassion
fatigue" to put emphasis on the indirect trauma experienced by
caregiving professionals who often support traumatized indi-
viduals (e.g., victims of crimes, survivors of natural disasters)
in the line of duty. A concise description of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5;APA,
2013) diagnostic criteria for PTSD is as follows: (a) experi-
ence of the stressor (e.g., direct or indirect exposure), (b) intru-
sive symptoms (e.g., intense or prolonged distress), (c)
avoidance (e.g., trauma-related external reminders), (d) nega-
tive alterations in cognition and mood (e.g., persistent dis-
torted blame of self or others), and (e) alterations in arousal
and reactivity (e.g., hypervigilance, sleep disturbance). These
symptoms need to have persisted for more than a month to
qualify as diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
It is estimated that the prevalence of PTSD among the
general population is 1.5% to 5.5% (Frans, Rimmö, Åberg,
& Fredrikson, 2005; Helzer, Robins, & McEvoy, 1987).
Unlike the general population, the prevalence of PTSD
among first responders is reported as follows: 7% to 19%
among police officers (Haugen et al., 2012), 14.6% among
EMS workers (Streb, Haller, & Michael, 2014), and 6.5% to
37% among firefighters (Del Ben et al., 2006). It should be
noted that the these numbers are not conclusive but rather
suggestive, considering that different researchers estimated
different PTSD prevalence rates among first responders;
however, their estimated PTSD prevalence rates for first
responders approximate the above-mentioned PTSD preva-
lence rates' ranges. For instance, Skogstad and colleagues
contended that PTSD prevalence among police officers is
less than 10% as opposed to a rate of 20% among firefighters
and EMS workers. In her article published in the issue on
"Diagnostic Cracks" in the journal of the National Center for
PTSD, Schnurr (2014) emphasized that although many cli-
ents appear to have multiple PTSD-related symptoms, clini-
cians are yet unable to diagnose them with PTSD on the
grounds that these clients lack the required symptoms to sat-
isfy the diagnostic criteria for a full PTSD diagnosis.
Considering the abovementioned issue, Schnurr (2014)
pointed out the catalytic role of "partial," "subthreshold," or
"subsyndromal" PTSD in helping in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of individuals with PTSD-related symptoms who did
not meet all the PTSD diagnostic criteria.
The Relationship Between PTSD, Suicide Risk,
and Alcohol Consumption
Apart from the psychiatric diagnostic criteria, research
showed that PTSD has a profound impact on first respond-
ers'psychosocial and professional lives. Specifically, in their
systematic review of the literature, Stergiopoulos, Cimo,
4 SAGE Open
Cheng, Bonato, and Dewa (2011) found that work-related
PTSD resulted in increased sick leave and had further mali-
cious effects on workers'productivity, leading in many cases
to burnout and even unemployment (Van der Ploeg & Kleber,
2003). In addition, there is a myriad of studies in the scien-
tific literature that emphasize on the relationship between
PTSD, alcohol consumption, and suicide risk among first
responders (e.g., Chopko, Palmieri, & Facemire, 2014;
Debell et al., 2014; Stanley, Hom, & Joiner, 2016). In their
study with police officers (n = 1,734) in Finland, Leino,
Eskelinen, Summala, and Virtanen (2012) inferred that
increased alcohol consumption, psychological distress, and
fear for future retraumatization were prevalent among those
who experienced work-related violence and injury.
Furthermore, Violanti and his colleagues (2011) found that
significantly more male officers compared with female offi-
cers were more at risk of higher levels of hazardous alcohol
use. Researchers in this study highlighted the officers' haz-
ardous alcohol use was not related to police work stress per
se; however, it was found to be significantly related to offi-
cers' personal life stressors (e.g., divorce, separation) and
believed that personal and family life stressors are related to
police work-related stressors' impact on officers' personal
and family lives. Even though some studies showed that
police officers' alcohol consumption is not significantly
higher than that of the general population (Lindsay, Taylor,
& Shelley, 2008; Weir, Stewart, & Morris, 2012), other stud-
ies found that exposure to critical incidents is associated with
increased PTSD symptomatology as well as alcohol con-
sumption among police officers (Ménard & Arter, 2013). To
this end, many researchers emphasized on the strong associa-
tion between PTSD and increased alcohol consumption
(Chopko, Palmieri, & Adams, 2013). Moreover, PTSD
symptomatology was found to mediate the relationship
between alcohol dependence and suicide risk among fire-
fighters (C. E. Martin et al., 2017). In his research with a U.S.
national police sample, Violanti, Robinson, and Shen (2013)
concluded that police officers indicated significantly higher
suicide risk compared with the general population. In addi-
tion, in another empirical study with police officers (n =
934), Violanti (2004) found that the combined impact of
PTSD and increased alcohol use appeared to increase the
odds of suicide ideation approximately 10 times. In addition,
Violanti's (2010) findings in this area of research revealed
that police suicides outnumbered police homicides by 2.36
times. Analogous findings in research with firefighters
revealed the association between PTSD and suicide risk
(Henderson, Van Hasselt, LeDuc, & Couwels, 2016).
PTSD: Risk and Protective Factors
Scientific research has extensively explored factors that play
a salient role in leading first responders to PTSD or prevent-
ing them from the onset of it (i.e., Kehl, Knuth, Hulse, &
Schmidt, 2015; MacDonald et al., 2003). Kehl and colleagues
(2015) argued that risk factors for PTSD are distinguished in
two categories: objective factors (i.e., tension of incident,
fatalities) and subjective ones (i.e., perceived life threats,
peritraumatic distress). Furthermore, researchers have
attempted to distinguish predictors of PTSD by establishing
three categories: pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttrau-
matic (Marchand, Nadeau, Beaulieu-Prevost, Boyer, &
Martin, 2015). However, it seems that the aforementioned
factors often overlap within the abovementioned categories.
For instance, prior psychopathology (i.e., depressive symp-
toms), poor communication among peers, and poor emotional
coping strategies, may be pre- and posttraumatic risk factors
for PTSD (Armstrong, Shakespeare-Finch, & Shochet, 2014;
Asmundson & Stapleton, 2008; Marchand et al., 2015). In
their systematic review of the literature (n = 4,301 articles),
Skogstad and colleagues concluded that first responders often
experience work-related PTSD, and they further found that
mental health problems prior to traumatic incident exposure
as well as lack of social support are factors that may increase
the risk of PTSD. What is noteworthy is that lack of social
support and poor communication within the organization rel-
ative to the traumatic experience were argued by many
researchers as risk factors associated with the onset of PTSD
among first responders (Armstrong et al., 2014; Stephens &
Long, 2000; Van der Ploeg & Kleber, 2003). Nonetheless,
what seems to be effective (protective factor) in terms of
social support and communication, specifically, is humor and
nonjudgmental and empathic listening between first respond-
ers and their supervisors (M. Martin, Marchand, Boyer, &
Martin, 2009; Stephens & Long, 2000) as well as emotional
expression between first responders and their family mem-
bers (Evans, Pistrang, & Billings, 2013). Furthermore, lack of
resources (i.e., psychological services) and the peritraumatic
sense of uncontrollability and unpredictability were also
found to be risk factors that may lead to the onset of PTSD
among first responders (Armstrong et al., 2014; Regambal
et al., 2015). In addition, peritraumatic dissociation (e.g.,
emotional numbness, derealization, depersonalization, lack
of awareness in one's surroundings) has been found to be one
of the risk factors that may trigger PTSD symptoms (M.
Martin et al., 2009).
From the organizational perspective, elevated organiza-
tional and operational stress among first responders may
trigger or deteriorate the PTSD symptoms (Armstrong et al.,
2014; Kehl et al., 2015). Conversely, low levels of opera-
tional and organizational stress and a strong sense of confi-
dence in their cognitive processing of a traumatic incident as
challenging (vs. threatening) were found to be protective fac-
tors against the onset of PTSD among first responders
(Armstrong et al., 2014; Streb et al., 2014). In their study on
firefighters (n = 397), Pinto and colleagues found that per-
ceived threats relative to the critical incident significantly
predicted PTSD symptomatology. Moreover, the intensity of
the traumatic incident and prior psychopathology (i.e., anxi-
ety or depressive symptoms) and/or previous exposure to a
Papazoglou 5
traumatic incident seem to be integral in the later onset of
PTSD (Armstrong et al., 2014; Asmundson & Stapleton,
2008; Luce, Firth-Cozens, Midgley, & Burges, 2002). More
specifically, in their phenomenological study with EMS
workers (n = 77) and firefighters (n = 103), de Soir and col-
leagues (2012) noted that the death of a colleague, the
involvement of a family member or friend in the incident,
and the pain and screaming of burned victims were major
characteristics of a traumatic incident that profoundly
affected both EMS personnel and firefighters.
PTSD and Psychophysiology: Heart Rate (HR)
Reactivity
A synthetic approach of the voluminous research work in the
psychophysiology of PTSD has indicated the close relation-
ship between PTSD and HR. In their theoretical analysis of
heart­brain interactions and psychophysiological coherence,
McCraty,Atkinson, Lipsenthal, andArguelles (2009) pointed
out that the natural fluctuations in HR ("so-called heart rate
variability [HRV]") emanate from the heart­brain interac-
tions as well as the interplay of the sympathetic and the para-
sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system
(ANS). Therefore, any fluctuation in psychological pro-
cesses--as occurs in negative emotions such as sadness--
was found to be directly associated with changes in HR
reactivity because the human body tends to maintain or
restore a harmonious state (Buckley, Holohan, Greif, Bedard,
& Suvak, 2004; McCraty et al., 2009; Norte et al., 2013).
Analogously, dysregulation of the ANS--increased sympa-
thetic and decreased parasympathetic activity--resulting
from a traumatic experience is often caused by depressed--
or maladaptive--HRV, indicating trauma survivors' reduced
capacity to regulate PTSD symptomatology (i.e., emotional
arousal, hypervigilance, stress; Tan et al., 2009). It is argued
that PTSD is akin to survivor's inability to restore the afore-
mentioned harmony due to the intense psychophysiological
reactivity to the traumatic experience; hence, survivors of
trauma diagnosed with PTSD manifest an elevated HR when
examined in their resting baseline levels, compared with
non-PTSD­diagnosed individuals (Buckley et al., 2004;
Norte et al., 2013).
Nevertheless, although research findings in measuring the
psychophysiology of PTSD showed that HRV was less
adaptable among veterans diagnosed with PTSD, HRV was
increased and PTSD symptoms reduced at the end of the
PTSD biofeedback treatment (Tan, Dao, Farmer, Sutherland,
& Gevirtz, 2011; Tan et al., 2009). Analogously, in their
study with individuals (n = 19) with PTSD diagnosis, Norte
and colleagues (2013) found that individuals diagnosed with
PTSD experienced persistently elevated HR and lowered
HRV during and after the reexperiencing of the traumatic
incident (researchers employed traumatic incident cues). In
similar ways, observational studies with veterans diagnosed
with PTSD indicated the relationship between PTSD and
elevated baseline resting HR (found 6.63 increased beats per
minute--BPM; Buckley et al., 2004) as well as depressed
HRV (Tan et al., 2009). What is also noteworthy is that indi-
viduals exposed to a traumatic event had elevated HR
(greater than one standard deviation above the age and sex
mean) 24 hr following exposure to trauma, and were signifi-
cantly more likely to experience PTSD symptoms in the
aftermath (6 months) of their traumatic experience (De
Young, Kenardy, & Spence, 2007).
Based on the previously discussed findings relative to the
direct association between PTSD and HR reactivity, many
researchers have suggested that HR reactivity be employed
as a way to predict the onset of PTSD following exposure to
a traumatic incident (De Young et al., 2007; Keane, Long,
Schmidt, Mincemoyer, & Garner, 1998; Kendall et al., 1998),
as well as to measure the reduction of PTSD symptomatol-
ogy following PTSD treatment (Rothbaum, Ruef, Litz, Han,
& Hodges, 2003; Tan et al., 2011). Furthermore, the employ-
ment of physiological measures in addition to the extant psy-
chological scales may endorse accuracy and reliability in the
assessment of PTSD among first responders (Orr & Roth,
2000). Analytically, Bauer and colleagues (2013) employed
physiological measures (HR, skin conductance, and electro-
myogram) and contrasted them with the Clinician-
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) in assessing a group of
participants (n = 46) diagnosed with PTSD at the beginning
of treatment and 6 months posttreatment. Their results indi-
cated a significant association between physiological mea-
sures and CAPS.
PTSD and Psychophysiology: Cortisol Hormone
Research indicated that hypothalamus­pituitary­adrenal
(HPA) axis dysregulation--hence cortisol secretion abnor-
mality--is associated with numerous psychological disorders
(Johnson, Kamilaris, Chrousos, & Gold, 1992; Tsigos &
Chrousos, 1996). Furthermore, chronic fatigue syndrome,
PTSD, and depressive symptomatology were found to be
related to cortisol level dysregulation (Morgan et al., 2000;
Tsigos & Chrousos, 1996); that is, cortisol dysregulation is
indicative of what McEwen (2000) referred to as "allostatic
load," a condition that manifests as a maladaptive response to
trauma exposure. In this direction, other research findings
suggested that cortisol secretion abnormality is also associ-
ated with immune system dysregulation, which increases the
risk of a number of diseases (i.e., vulnerability to influenza
virus and infectious illnesses; Padgett & Glaser, 2003; Wirth
et al., 2011). In their systematic review article, Chida and
Steptoe (2009) found that the cortisol awakening response
(CAR) phenomenon was positively associated with job stress
and general life stress. Therefore, individuals occupied in
highly stressful professions (i.e., elite athletes, soldiers;
Morgan et al., 2001; Skoluda, Dettenborn, Stalder, &
Kirschbaum, 2012) and specific population groups who expe-
rience extreme stress and trauma (i.e., veterans; Baker et al.,
6 SAGE Open
2005) have elevated CAR values compared with the general
population. Various stressors over one's daily life may induce
elevated cortisol levels (Chida and Steptoe, 2009; Dickerson
& Kemeny, 2004), that is, stress reactivity cortisol levels.
Analytically, when an individual perceives a stressor--either
physical or psychological--the hypothalamus produces the
corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which then leads to
the synthesis of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
by the pituitary gland, which, in turn, stimulates the adrenal
cortex to release cortisol (Shalev et al., 2009).
Research with PTSD-diagnosed individuals inferred that
cortisol dysregulation and PTSD are closely associated (Dekel,
Ein-Dor, Gordon, Rosen, & Bonanno, 2013; McFarlane,
Barton, Yehuda, & Wittert, 2011; Weems & Carrion, 2007);
specifically, PTSD-diagnosed individuals manifested sup-
pressed diurnal cortisol levels (Yehuda, Halligan, Golier,
Grossman, & Bierer, 2004). The inexorable relationship
between cortisol dysregulation and PTSD is emphasized by
Yehuda and Golier (2009) who argued that
it is often stated that cortisol-related alternations in PTSD are
"controversial." It is perhaps more accurate to conclude that
such alterations have not always been detected; perhaps
reflecting that cortisol levels are dynamic and subject to a large
degree of measurement error and individual variation. (p. 1113)
Observational studies with first responders (Witteveen et al.,
2010) and veterans (Lauc et al., 2004) diagnosed with PTSD
showed that both first responders and veterans who partici-
pated in the studies had "flat-like" diurnal cortisol patterns
compared with the regular ones. Analogously, Neylan and
colleagues (2005) studied police officers (n = 30) exposed to
a traumatic incident, and their findings showed the significant
relationship between elevated CAR and PTSD. Conversely,
in their study with police officers (n = 100) diagnosed with
PTSD (mild, moderate, and severe type of PTSD), Violanti
and colleagues (2007) contended that an association between
PTSD and cortisol dysregulation existed among their study
participants. They also found that officers diagnosed with
severe PTSD symptomatology manifested elevated CAR.
Their findings come in contradiction with other studies in this
area; however, Violanti and colleagues (2007) interpreted
their findings on the grounds that police trauma--as opposed
to other traumatized groups previously studied--is multifac-
eted, chronic, and complex; yet, research knowledge of the
biological impact of trauma or threat on police officers is still
limited. However, it is argued that HPA axis dysregulation--
prior to trauma exposure--seems to be a predictor in the
pathogenesis of PTSD following traumatic experience
(Inslicht et al., 2011; Pineles et al., 2013). Longitudinal stud-
ies with police officers demonstrated that short-term after-
noon or night shift employment is associated with lower CAR
(Wirth et al., 2011); in addition, lower CAR before exposure
to a potentially traumatic incident was associated with post-
trauma negative moods, anxiety symptoms, and physiological
reactivity (HR and skin conductance) among police officers
and firefighters (Pineles et al., 2013). Randomized clinical tri-
als (RCTs) with individuals diagnosed with PTSD--and also
with those who manifested lower cortisol levels before treat-
ment--indicated that PTSD psychotherapy treatment (brief
eclectic) was effective in increasing cortisol levels among
those who received the treatment (Olff, de Vries, Güzelcan,
Assies, & Gersons, 2007). Analogous outcomes (RCT) were
found with mindfulness-based treatment delivered to veterans
diagnosed with PTSD compared with those who participated
in the control group (Bergen-Cico, Possemato, & Pigeon,
2014). However, Gerardi, Rothbaum, Astin, and Kelley
(2010) reported that prolonged exposure therapy or eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) treat-
ment significantly reduced elevated cortisol levels among
rape victims diagnosed with PTSD. The aforementioned
research findings indicate the effectiveness of PTSD evi-
dence-based treatment in significantly reducing HPA (and
cortisol) dysregulation.
Cognitive­Behavioral Therapy (CBT):
An Overview
CBT was developed as a psychotherapeutic approach in the
late 1950s by Albert Ellis, who developed the rational-emo-
tive therapy (RET), and Aaron Beck, who developed cogni-
tive therapy (CT; Corey, 2008). Ellis argued that the
philosophic origins of RET can be traced back to the writ-
ings of Stoic philosophers and, more specifically, the work
of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius who believed that indi-
viduals are not disturbed by events per se but by the way
they view the events around them (Corey, 2008). Based on
the previously mentioned assumptions of CBT, clients are
encouraged to identify, dispute, and constructively change
any thoughts, beliefs, assumptions, and emotions that seem
to cause distress in their lives (Rector, 2010). Such dis-
torted assumptions or core beliefs may be related--but not
limited--to all-or-nothing thinking (e.g., if she calls me she
loves me or if she does not she hates me), overgeneraliza-
tion (e.g., the world is against me), and catastrophizing
(e.g., there is no future for me). The major role of the CBT
therapist is to help her or his client target and evaluate the
distorted automatic thoughts or core beliefs related to cer-
tain incidents (Rector, 2010). As Ellis (1994) argued,
human beings are often trapped in the horrific context of
the irrational "shoulds" and "musts" ("Must-arbation"),
and the therapist's role is to dispute the client's irrational
beliefs and help them transform irrational beliefs into ratio-
nal ones. Taking into consideration that distorted beliefs
about specific situations are associated with (negative)
emotions and behavioral patterns, any positive change of
the distorted beliefs may lead to positive emotional and
adaptive behavioral patterns within a subjectively "prob-
lematic" situation for the client (Corey, 2008). Therefore,
Papazoglou 7
CBT sets a goal-oriented, teleological, problem-focused,
well-structured--in the here and now--approach, which
also focuses on therapeutic alliance and rapport between
the CBT therapist and the client (Rector, 2010).
CBT: An Evidence-Based PTSD Treatment
A simple search on Google Scholar about the CBT treatment
for PTSD leads to more than 18,800 results for published
articles, training materials, and commentaries related to the
topic. In PTSD treatment, CBT has been identified as one of
the most effective approaches (Koucky, Dickstein, & Chard,
2013) and is argued by many to complement pharmacother-
apy for PTSD symptomatology reduction (Ramirez-Basco,
Glickman, Weatherford, & Ryser, 2000). In their systematic
review of the literature on the efficacy of the CBT treatment
for PTSD, Harvey, Bryant, and Tarrier (2003) found that
CBT proved to be effective in helping individuals who had
survived traumatic situations (assault, terrorism, traffic acci-
dents, refugees, child abuse) as well as in helping survivors
struggling with multiple PTSD symptoms: improved social
adjustment, decreased catastrophic cognitions, reduced
avoidance, better quality of sleep, decreased muscle tension,
and decreased hypersensitivity. Trauma-focused CBT (or
CBT-PTSD) can be alternatively delivered in the form of
web-based therapy and/or telemedicine to clients residing in
remote areas with limited access to a CBT therapist (Foa,
Gillihan, & Bryant, 2013).Analogously, research has showed
that returning veterans were amenable to PTSD treatment
and achieved PTSD symptoms' reduction after the delivery
of a brief CBT intervention (one session) via telephone
(Stecker, McHugo, Xie, Whyman, & Jones, 2014). Another
study examined the effectiveness of CBT group therapy (6
weeks) in helping military personnel (n = 496) suffering
from PTSD; the study outcomes demonstrated that PTSD
symptomatology reduction was effective during follow-up
assessments (3, 6, and 12 months postintake; Khoo, Dent, &
Oei, 2011). The trauma-focused CBT approach has been
effectively applied to different victims/survivors of trauma,
such as rape survivors (Jaycox, Zoellner, & Foa, 2002), New
York City Transit employees (Lowinger & Rombom, 2012),
psychotic patients who have experienced PTSD (Callcott,
Standart, & Turkington, 2004; Ehlers, 2004), interpersonal
violence trauma survivors (Iverson et al., 2011), and survi-
vors of the 2005 London bombings (Wilson, d'Ardenne,
Scott, Fine, & Priebe, 2012). From an international perspec-
tive, Kagoo, Suh, and Naidoo (2004) reported that all their
participants considered CBT as an appropriate treatment for
their traumatized clients in their training work with South
African trauma therapists.
In their RCT with adult female survivors of childhood
sexual abuse (n = 74), McDonagh et al. (2005) randomized
their participants in CBT, into present-centered therapy
(PCT), and wait-listed (WL) condition. In their 6-month fol-
low-up assessment with the CAPS, they found that 76.5% of
the CBT group participants had no PTSD symptomatology
and that the CBT group was superior to the WL group. In
another RCT with patients who experienced PTSD due to
severe motor vehicle crash, Wu, Li, and Cho (2014) random-
ized their participants (n = 60) in a CBT and self-help pro-
gram (SHP) group. In a 6-month follow-up, they found that
the patients from the CBT group had significantly decreased
their anxiety symptoms, their depressive symptoms, their
intrusive thoughts, and their hyperarousal compared with the
SHP group patients. Similar results have been found with
other RCTs with veterans who experienced military sexual
trauma (CBT group vs. PCT group), showing the high effec-
tiveness of CBT trauma-focused treatment compared with
other treatments (Surís, Link-Malcolm, Chard, Ahn, &
North, 2013). Furthermore, an RCT of CBT-PTSD treatment
for severely mentally ill patients showed that the CBT group
was more effective compared with the control group in
CAPS score (PTSD symptomatology) and depressive symp-
toms reduction.
From an international perspective, an RCT for war-
affected Congolese boys (n = 50) showed that the CBT group
had a significant PTSD symptomatology reduction--com-
pared with the control group--at the end of the treatment pro-
gram (McMullen, O'Callaghan, Shannon, Black, & Eakin,
2013). In a very similar study with war-affected Congolese
girls, researchers found significant reduction in trauma symp-
toms between the CBT and the WL group (O'Callaghan,
McMullen, Shannon, Rafferty, & Black, 2013). Other RCT
studies showed significant effectiveness of CBT-PTSD treat-
mentwithregardtothefollowingminoritygroups:Cambodian
refugees (Hinton, Hofmann, Pollack, & Otto, 2009), Latino
women (Hinton, Hofmann, Rivera, Otto, & Pollack, 2011),
Vietnamese refugees (Hinton et al., 2004), and Black females
diagnosed with PTSD (Otto, 2000).
Discussion: What Is Missing?
In a study conducted by Becker et al. (2009) with first
responders (n = 379) from a southern state of the United
States, participants were asked to identify their preference
for psychotherapeutic treatment in a potential situation from
which they might experience PTSD. What is interesting is
that almost 90% of the participants chose CBT as their first
or second most preferred treatment compared with other
offered treatments (e.g., pharmacological, brief eclectic,
EMDR). Nevertheless, as Flannery (2015) argued, "research
on the treatment interventions of first responders has been
limited" (p. 261). Literature in the area of CBT-PTSD treat-
ment for first responders is sparse; researchers have con-
ducted case studies examining the effectiveness of CBT
treatment in one police officer diagnosed with PTSD (Tolin
& Foa, 1999) and chronic PTSD (Cornelius & Kenyon-
Jump, 2007). What is noteworthy is that there are almost no
RCTs of CBT treatments for PTSD among first responders
and, hence, the effectiveness of CBT in reducing PTSD
8 SAGE Open
symptomatology among first responders is unknown (Harvey
et al., 2003; Stergiopoulos et al., 2011). Indeed, in their sys-
tematic review of the literature, Haugen et al. (2012)
attempted to identify RCTs for PTSD among first respond-
ers; researchers inferred that from the 845 peer-reviewed
articles found, only two--equal to 0.002% of all the stud-
ies--were RCTs of PTSD treatment among first responders.
Following the abovementioned systematic review, from
those two RCTs found, the first (Gersons, Carlier, Lamberts,
& van der Kolk, 2000) examined the effectiveness of brief
eclectic therapy (EBT) delivered to police officers (n = 42)
and the second one (Difede et al., 2007) explored the effec-
tiveness of a 12-week CBT treatment program delivered to
disaster workers who responded to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
To date, there are no RCTs to study the effectiveness of CBT-
PTSD treatment for first responders using psychophysiologi-
cal assessment. In this direction, Lindauer and colleagues
(2006) have attempted to psychophysiologically assess the
efficacy of script-driven imagery for individuals diagnosed
with PTSD. However, a considerable limitation of their study
is that police officer participants (n = 15) were only exam-
ined in the pretest phase because they all discontinued their
research participation.
Nevertheless, some scholars and professionals may argue
that police and military tasks are quite overlapping. For
instance, in both fields, military personnel as well as first
responders are mandated to respond to critical incident situa-
tions and most--if not all--of the times the danger against
their own lives is omnipresent. Thereby, one may contend that
the evidence-based outcomes of CBT-PTSD treatment among
military soldiers and veterans may give us enough evidence
that the effectiveness of CBT-PTSD treatment is also perva-
sive among first responders. At this point, the author posits
that first responders' work is unique and in many ways dis-
tinct from military mission. CBT-PTSD treatment may be
effective for--most--first responders and, hence, after the
successful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment, they may not
experience any PTSD-related symptomatology. Nonetheless,
the author contends that what distinguishes first responders
from military personnel and other populations is that first
responders may have significant elevated risk to relapse to
PTSD after successful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment.
The last assumption is emanated from the fact that first
responders'work is singular and distinct from that of military.
After successful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment, first
responders are expected to return to the line of duty and,
hence, they are mandated to respond to critical incident situa-
tions. Undeniably, some of those critical incident situations
are expected to be life-threatening ones. The challenging--
and even iconoclastic for the traditional PTSD treatment tra-
ditions--query may be the following: Is CBT-PTSD treatment
sufficient enough so that it effectively prevents PTSD relapse
among first responders, who returned to the line of duty after
successful completion of CBT-PTSD treatment? In addition,
is PTSD psychosocial assessment a sufficient indicator of
first responders' readiness to return to the line of duty after
completion of CBT-PTSD treatment? Currently, there is no
evidence-based finding that would provide us with substan-
tial answer to the previous questions. For instance, Longmore
and Worrell (2007) highlighted the scarcity of data that cogni-
tive change in CBT treatment is the one that leads to symp-
tomatic improvement. This last challenging perspective
(cognitive change during CBT treatment) may be even more
pervasive among first responders because their cognitive
functioning in the line of duty is incumbent to the rationale of
being alert and well-prepared to respond. Literature showed
that various populations (i.e., incarcerated women, veterans)
who successfully completed CBT-PTSD treatment relapsed
in a certain period of time after completion of treatment
(Stecker et al., 2014; Zlotnick, Johnson, & Najavits, 2009). In
their systematic review of the efficacy of prolonged exposure
therapy among anxiety disorder­diagnosed clients, Craske
and colleagues (2008) emphasized the salient role of measur-
ing physiological reactivity as a way to assess efficacy of
treatment outcomes. What is also essential is that Craske and
colleagues (2008) contended that physiological measurement
should not be restricted to one variable specifically (e.g.,
HR); instead, it should include more than one physiological
reactivity variables (e.g., HRV, skin conductance, cortisol), so
that researchers employ a more holistic approach in the way
they measure the psychophysiological efficacy of prolonged
exposure treatment in clients diagnosed with anxiety-related
disorders. Consequently, it is paramount that we study the
psychophysiology of those first responders who may not be
treated successfully by CBT-PTSD treatment as well as those
first responders who--even though completed CBT-PTSD
treatment successfully--have relapsed to PTSD symptom-
atology after return to the line of duty.
Conclusion: Recommendations for
Future Research
The introductory section illustrates the complexity and
cumulative form of trauma experienced by first responders in
the line of duty. As it was mentioned, trauma exposure may
lead first responders to the onset of PTSD, among other
severe mental and physical health issues. Nevertheless,
police organizations invest millions of dollars to make sure
that first responders receive the highest quality of training,
advanced technological equipment, and other necessary
means to efficiently maintain peace and order in the com-
munities they serve (Andersen et al., 2015). However, first
responders' efficacy in the workplace may be thwarted by
complex mental health issues, such as PTSD. To this end,
many scholars have emphasized on the efficacy of trauma
prevention and resilience promotion programs that may sup-
port first responders' mental preparedness in the face of
adversities (e.g., Andersen et al., 2015; Skeffington, Rees,
Mazzucchelli, & Kane, 2016). That is, it is essential that
most organizations invest on first responders' training and
Papazoglou 9
equipment; however, author suggests that organizational
investment with additional funds and resources for first
responders' mental preparedness (e.g., trauma preventative
training) should also be prioritized as a way to equip first
responders against the risk to develop PTSD and other
comorbid disorders.
One of the challenges that should be highlighted is first
responders'reintegration back into the operational units after
CBT-PTSD treatment completion. The author suggests that
future research should also emphasize on first responders'
reintegration procedures and develop evidence-based prac-
tices that can facilitate first responders' reintegration in their
agencies. For instance, would a police detective be ready to
return to his previous tasks right after successful completion
of CBT-PTSD treatment? Perhaps, this kind of reintegration
procedure needs to occur gradually until both health profes-
sionals and high-ranking managers feel confident that detec-
tive is fully prepared to return to the previous position. That
is, mental health professionals (e.g., psychiatrists, psycholo-
gists, mental health counselors) are expected to work closely
with agencies' high-ranking managers to facilitate reintegra-
tion procedures (e.g., assessments on a systematic basis)
through a multidisciplinary collaboration. The Israeli mili-
tary has developed exemplary policy programs that assist
soldiers who experience PTSD to attend adequate treatment
programs and then return back to their service successfully
(Cobb, 2013). Toward this direction, Israeli military has
developed army-based psychoeducation programs to destig-
matize the experience of PTSD in the military and also estab-
lished "mental health gyms" that allow mental health
professionals to be present in the military training arenas and
units so that resilience promotion prioritized (Cobb, 2013).
Furthermore, research with U.S. combat veterans indicated
that awareness of PTSD-related early help seeking might
prevent the incapacitating impact of PTSD on veterans'
health (Mittal et al., 2013). Such practices may be transferred
and applied to first responders' agencies. For instance, men-
tal health professionals may train high-ranking managers as
well as first responders to identify cues that indicate the pres-
ence of PTSD symptomatology. That way, help seeking can
be better coordinated and CBT-PTSD treatment be more effi-
cient if provided in early stages of PTSD development
(Adler, Bliese, McGurk, Hoge, & Castro, 2009; Ehlers et al.,
2003).
However, if first responders diagnosed with PTSD remain
untreated, they will be unable to properly provide their ser-
vices and the government's expenditures for first responders'
preparedness and training will be in vain; that is, PTSD pre-
cludes them from properly providing their services. Even
though CBT has been proved to be effective in treating
PTSD, research--especially RCTs--in examining the effi-
cacy of CBT in ameliorating PTSD symptomatology among
first responders is sparse. The current article aimed to intro-
duce an innovative idea: Specifically, it attempted to discuss
a synthesis of psychological and physiological measures so
that the CBT-PTSD effectiveness among first responders is
examined and justified via empirical research. Finally, the
author hopes that the present article will draw attention to the
necessity of future empirical research in relation to psycho-
physiological improvement among first responders who
receive CBT-PTSD treatment.

officers suffering from trauma and stress-related issues. He has
published more than 35 scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals
and book chapters. In addition, he presented his research work
(more than 100 presentations) in many scientific venues (e.g.,
