abstract
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the epidemiology of injuries associated
with nursery products among young children treated in US emergency departments.
METHODS: Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were retrospectively
analyzed for patients aged <3 years who sustained an injury associated with a nursery
product from 1991 through 2011.
RESULTS: An estimated 1391844 (95% confidence interval, 1169489­1614199) nursery
product­related injuries among children aged <3 years were treated in US emergency
departments during the 21-year study period, averaging 56.29 injuries per 10000 children.
The annual injury rate decreased significantly by 33.9% from 1991 to 2003, followed by a
significant increase of 23.7% from 2003 to 2011. The decrease was driven by a significant
decline in baby walker/jumper/exerciser-related injuries; the increase was driven by a
significant increase in concussions and closed head injuries. Nursery product­related
injuries were most commonly associated with baby carriers (19.5%), cribs/mattresses
(18.6%), strollers/carriages (16.5%), or baby walkers/jumpers/exercisers (16.2%). The
most common mechanism of injury was a self-precipitated fall (80.0%), and the most
frequently injured body region was the head or neck (47.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although successful injury prevention efforts with baby walkers led to a decline
in nursery product­related injuries from 1991 to 2003, the number and rate of these
injuries have been increasing since 2003. Greater efforts are warranted to prevent injuries
associated with other nursery products, especially baby carriers, cribs, and strollers.
Prevention of falls and concussions/closed head injuries associated with nursery products
also deserves special attention.

What's Known on This Subject: Previous
studies have described the epidemiology of injuries
associated with specific nursery products, such as
cribs and baby walkers. No study has attempted to
examine and compare classes of nursery products
by using a nationally representative sample.
What This Study Adds: This study is the first to
use nationally representative data to investigate the
epidemiology of injuries associated with a broad
range of nursery products among young children.
The rise in these injuries since 2003 warrants
increased injury prevention efforts.
Gaw et al
Nearly every household in the United
States with a newborn or young child
uses nursery products, which include
infant furniture, barriers, walkers,
devices, and equipment used for
transporting, bathing, or caring for
a child. These products are intended
to help parents raise their children.
However, nursery products can pose
a threat to the well-being of young
children, especially if the products do
not meet current safety standards.
From 2009 to 2012, nursery
products were the leading category
of children's products recalled in the
United State,
1
­
4 and they account
for millions of dangerous products
found in US households.5,

6 Nursery
products are known to be a source
of child injuries7 and deaths.8,

9 In
2014, there were 69300 emergency
department (ED) visits by children <5
years old attributable to nursery
products.10
Few studies have evaluated injuries
associated with multiple classes of
nursery products among infants and
children, including 1 small study in a
non-US population.11 Most previous
epidemiologic studies focus on
injuries associated with 1 or several
products in a single product class,
such as strollers,
12
­
14 cribs,
15 baby
walkers,
16
­20 and baby bottles,
21
using both regional and national data.
Nursery product safety is a critical
yet challenging issue in injury
prevention, complicated by the
rapid anatomic, motor, and cognitive
development of young children as
well as injury profiles unique to
specific products based on their
design and use.15,

22 Identification of
injury characteristics and patterns
associated with nursery products is
therefore essential in pinpointing
areas of greatest concern for
caregivers, health care providers,
manufacturers, and policy makers.
The objective of the present study
was to determine the epidemiology of
injuries associated with a wide array
of nursery products among young
children treated in US EDs. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to
comprehensively investigate nursery
product­related injuries by using a
nationally representative sample.
Methods
Data Source
The National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System (NEISS),
23 which
is operated by the US Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC),
monitors consumer product­related
and sports and recreational activity­
related injuries treated in US EDs.24
Approximately 100 hospitals,
including 8 children's hospitals,
contribute to the NEISS, which
represents a stratified probability
sample of >5300 hospitals with a
24-hour ED with at least 6 beds in the
United States and its territories.25,

26
Professional NEISS coders abstract
information from ED medical records,
including patient demographic
characteristics, the consumer product
involved, injury diagnosis, affected
body region, disposition from the ED,
and a brief narrative regarding the
circumstances of the incident.27
Nursery product­related injuries
among children aged <3 years
reported through the NEISS
from 1991 through 2011 were
retrospectively analyzed. Nursery
product­related injuries were
identified by using 39 discrete
NEISS consumer product codes
(Supplemental Information),
24
which were based on the product
codes included in the CPSC annual
report on nursery product­related
injuries and deaths.10 Each case
narrative was then examined, and
cases were excluded if the injury
did not involve a nursery product
or involved a motor vehicle crash,
diaper rash, animal bite, dermatitis,
or conjunctivitis. The final data set
contained 48653 actual cases.
Study Variables
NEISS case narratives were
individually reviewed to identify
the mechanism of injury, which
was classified as follows: (1) fell
spontaneously or due to actions of
the patient; (2) fell due to actions
of another person; (3) collision
with or while using the product; (4)
breathing related; (5) entrapment;
(6) product failure, which includes
product collapse or malfunction; (7)
ingestion; (8) nonfatal submersion;
and (9) other. In instances in which
mechanisms of injury overlapped, the
initial event in a sequence of events
was considered the mechanism of
injury. NEISS consumer product
codes were regrouped into 12 major
categories of nursery products,
similar to categories used by the
CPSC (Supplemental Information).10
The NEISS variable for age was
regrouped into 0 to 5 months, 6 to
11 months, 12 to 17 months, 18 to
23 months, and 24 to 35 months.
Injury diagnosis was categorized as
follows: (1) ingestion; (2) aspiration;
(3) burn; (4) laceration (including
the NEISS categories of amputation,
laceration, puncture, and nondental
avulsion); (5) concussion/closed
head injury (CHI), including internal
organ injury to the head; (6) soft
tissue injury, including crushing,
contusion/abrasion, hematoma,
and strain/sprain; (7) anoxia/
submersion; (8) fracture; (9) dental
injury; or (10) other, including
dislocation, foreign body, nerve
damage, hemorrhage, electric shock,
poisoning, internal organ injury to
non-head body regions, and other.
Body region was grouped into: (1)
upper extremity, including shoulder,
elbow, upper arm, lower arm,
wrist, hand, and finger; (2) lower
extremity, including knee, upper
leg, lower leg, ankle, foot, and toe;
(3) trunk, including upper trunk,
lower trunk, and pubic region;
(4) head/neck; (5) face, including
face, eye, mouth, and ear; and (6)
other, including injury to >25%
of the body. Disposition from the
ED was categorized as: (1) treated
and released; (2) hospitalized,
2
PEDIATRICS Volume 139, number 4, April 2017
including NEISS categories of
treated and transferred, treated and
admitted, and held for <24 hours for
observation; (3) left against medical
advice; and (4) fatality. Location
of injury was grouped into home
(including home, apartment/condo,
and manufactured/mobile home) and
other. Additional variables analyzed
included sex and year.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed by using SPSS
version 20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics,
IBM Corporation) and SAS 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) statistical
software. National injury estimates
were calculated by using sample
weights provided by the CPSC.25,

26,

28
All data reported in the present
article are stable national estimates
unless otherwise noted. An estimate is
considered unstable if the estimate
is <1200 cases, the sample size
is <20 cases, or the coefficient of
variation is >30%. US Census Bureau
July 1 intercensal and postcensal
population estimates from 1991
to 2011 were used to calculate
injury rates.29­
31 Piecewise linear
regression models were used to
analyze the trends. Trends involving
all nursery products (Fig 1) or baby
walkers/jumpers/exercisers (Fig 2)
were analyzed by using 2003 as a
breakpoint, whereas concussion/CHI
(Fig 3) trends were analyzed by using
2005 as a breakpoint. The estimated
annual rate of change from the
regression model, denoted by
"m,
" was reported along with the
P value associated with the t test used
to test for its statistical significance.
Other analyses included the Rao-
Scott 2 test for association, and
calculation of relative risk (RR) with
a 95% confidence interval (CI). The
level of significance for all statistical
tests was  = 0.05. This study was
approved by the institutional review
board of The Research Institute at
Nationwide Children's Hospital.

or 56.29 (95% CI, 47.30­65.29)
injuries per 10000 children. More
than one-half (58.7%) of all injuries
occurred during the first year of
life, with infants 6 to 11 months old
(35.5%) accounting for the highest
proportion of injuries (Table 1).
The median age of patients was 9.3
months (interquartile range, 5.3­15.3
months). More boys (54.9%) were
injured than girls, and a majority of
injuries occurred at home (87.9%).
Injury Trends
There was a significant decline in
both the annual number of nursery
product­related injuries (­33.0%;
m = ­2323; P < .001) and the injury
rate per 10000 children <3 years
old (­33.9%; m = ­2.00; P < .001)
from 1991 through 2003, after which
both the number and rate increased
significantly through 2011 by 23.5%
(m = 2147; P < .001) and 23.7%
(m = 1.52; P < .001), respectively
(Fig 1). The main contributing factor
to the decline was the decrease in
the number of baby walker/jumper/
exerciser-related injuries, which
decreased significantly by 86.0%
(m = ­2051; P < .001) from 1991 to
2003, before leveling off (­8.9%;
m = 114; P = .299) from 2003 through
2011 (Figs 1 and 2). Although
several nursery product categories
contributed to the overall increase
observed after 2003 (Fig 2), there
was no specific product category
responsible for the trend. An increase
in a diagnosis category (concussion/
CHI), rather than a product category,
was the main contributor to the
observed increase in injuries during
the latter part of the study period.
The annual number (­12.9%;
m = ­113; P = .157) and rate (­14.2%;
m = ­0.12; P = .070) of nursery
product­related concussions/CHIs
did not decrease significantly from
1991 to 2005, and both the number
(114.0%; m = 2667; P < .001) and
rate (114.8%; m = 2.17; P < .001)
increased significantly by >100%
from 2005 through 2011 (Fig 3).
Injury Mechanism and Nursery
Product Involved
A self-precipitated fall was the
most common mechanism of injury
(80.0%) (Table 2). Patients <6
months old were more likely to suffer
injuries from a breathing-related
mechanism (RR, 4.41 [95% CI,
3.48­5.60]), caregiver-related falls
(RR, 5.98 [95% CI, 5.16­6.92), and
product failure (RR, 3.02 [95% CI,
2.33­3.91]) than older patients. One-
and two-year-old patients were more
likely (RR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.16­2.94])
to be injured from being entrapped in
a product than patients <1 year old.
Nursery product­related injuries
were most commonly associated
with baby carriers (19.5%), cribs/
mattresses (18.6%), strollers/
carriages (16.5%), and baby walkers/
jumpers/exercisers (16.2%) (Table 2).
These groups of nursery products
also accounted for 86.1% of the
injuries caused by self-precipitated
falls. Baby carriers accounted for
54.0% of injuries among children <6
months old, and baby walkers/
jumpers/exercisers accounted for
36.4% of injuries among children
aged 6 to 11 months. Baby carriers
were 5.52 times (95% CI, 4.61­6.60;
7.9% vs 1.4%) more likely to be
related to a caregiver fall compared
with other product groups, and they
accounted for more than one-half
(57.3%) of caregiver-related falls.
Strollers/carriages (RR, 1.68 [95%
CI, 1.35­2.08]; 3.6% vs 2.1%) and
cribs/mattresses (RR, 3.18 [95%
CI, 2.68­3.77]; 5.3% vs 1.7%) were
associated with a greater risk of
entrapment compared with other

product categories. Product failure
accounted for 0.9% of injuries, and
almost one-half were associated with
baby carriers (29.9%) or strollers/
carriages (19.3%).
Body Region and Diagnosis
The head/neck was the most
common body region injured
(47.1%), followed by the face
(34.0%) (Table 1). The proportion
of head/neck injuries decreased
with increasing age, whereas the
proportion of upper and lower
extremity injuries increased with
increasing age. Patients <1 year old
were more likely (RR, 1.63 [95% CI,
1.57­1.70]) to sustain an injury to the
head/neck, and patients aged
1 year were more likely (RR, 3.33
[95% CI, 3.00­3.71]) to sustain
an injury to the upper extremity
compared with the other age group.
The body region injured was not only
associated with patient age but also
with nursery product category and
injury mechanism. Baby carriers,
changing tables, portable baby
swings, and baby bouncer seats
combined were more likely (RR,
1.47 [95% CI, 1.41­1.54]; 61.6%
vs 41.8%) to be associated with
injuries to the head/neck compared
with the other product groups.
Strollers/carriages (RR, 1.34 [95%
CI, 1.27­1.41]; 43.0% vs 32.1%) and
baby bottles/warmers/sterilizers
(RR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.78­2.07];
63.2% vs 32.9%) were more likely
to be associated with facial injuries
compared with other product groups.
Entrapment was 6.70 (95% CI, 6.15­
7.31; 56.6% vs 8.5%) times more
likely to cause an upper extremity
injury than other injury mechanisms.
Soft tissue injury (38.0%) and
concussion/CHI (26.3%) were the
most common diagnoses (Table 1).
The proportion of injuries accounted
for by concussion/CHI increased
during the study period from
18.6% in 1991 to 41.9% in 2011.
The proportion of concussions/
CHIs decreased with increasing age,
and the proportion of lacerations
increased with increasing age.
Patients 18 months old (RR, 2.17
[95% CI, 1.92­2.46]) were more
likely to be diagnosed with a fracture,
whereas patients <18 months old
(RR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.62­1.87]) were
more likely to be diagnosed with
a concussion/CHI compared with
the other age group. The face was
7.00 (95% CI, 6.25­7.85; 38.2% vs
5.4%) times more likely to sustain
a laceration; the upper and lower
extremities (RR, 13.75 [95% CI,
11.91­15.87]; 34.0% vs 2.5%)
combined were more likely to sustain
a fracture compared with other body
regions.
Disposition From EDs and Fatalities
Most (95.1%) children presenting
to an ED with a nursery product­
related injury were treated and
released (Table 1). Of the patients
admitted to the hospital (4.0%),
73.7% were <1 year old. Patients
<6 months old were 2.11 times
(95% CI, 1.81­2.46) more likely to
be hospitalized than patients 6
months old. Baby carriers (25.8%),
cribs/mattresses (19.5%), and baby
walkers/jumpers/exercisers (18.7%)
were most commonly associated with
injuries requiring hospital admission.
The breathing-related and nonfatal
submersion mechanisms of injury
combined were 6.56 (95% CI, 5.03­
8.55; 24.9% vs 3.8%) times more
likely to lead to hospitalization than
the other mechanisms.
Of the 0.2% of injuries that resulted
in death, 80.2% were among
patients <1 year old, 86.9% were
associated with the breathing-
related mechanism, and 73.4% were
associated with cribs/mattresses.
Baby carriers were associated with
an additional 10.1% of deaths.
Discussion
On average, >66000 nursery
product­related injuries were treated
in the US EDs annually from 1991
through 2011. Despite the significant
decline in both the number and rate
of nursery product­related injuries
from 1991through 2003, primarily
attributable to the decline in baby
walker/jumper/exerciser-related
injuries, both the number and rate
of injuries increased significantly
from 2003 through 2011. Part of this
increase was driven by an increase in
the number and rate of concussions/
CHIs, which is likely attributable
to multiple factors, including
heightened awareness about
concussions during recent years
among parents, child caregivers,
and health professionals. These
findings agree with a recent study,
which reported a >200% increase
in traumatic brain injuries among
children aged <5 years occurring
in the home from 1991 to 2012.32
Further research is needed to better
define the factors contributing to the
observed increase in concussions/
CHIs.
From 2009 to 2012, nursery products
were the leading children's product
category recalled in the United
States,
1
­
4 and it is estimated that
up to 80% of recalled children's
products remain in consumer
households after a recall.6 Since
enactment of the Consumer Product
Safety Improvement Act of 2008,
which (among other requirements)
mandated safety standards for all
durable infant or toddler products,
33
product recalls have begun to
decline.6 However, components of the
law are continuing to be phased-in,
and its effects on nursery product­
related injuries is unlikely to be
reflected in the results of the present
study. Future research is warranted
to assess the effects of this important
consumer product legislation on
nursery product­related injuries to
children.
Given the success of interventions
to prevent injuries associated
with baby walkers, including
strengthened safety standards and
new safer product design,
18,

efforts should be used to address
injuries associated with other
nursery products, especially the top
contributors to pediatric morbidity
in this study: baby carriers, cribs/
mattresses, and strollers/carriages.
Baby carriers were the leading
source of nursery product­related
injuries and hospital admissions.
Baby carrier­related falls involving
caregivers may lead to more severe
injuries due to factors such as
the caregiver falling on top of the
child or propelling the child with
additional momentum during a fall.34
To reduce the likelihood of these
injuries, caregivers should attempt
to keep living spaces free of objects
that pose a tripping hazard. Child
caregivers using a carrier should
minimize the use of stairs and
refrain from carrying other objects
while on the stairs, using the free
hand to grasp the handrail.35 Infants
should be matched to carriers that
are appropriate for their size and
weight.36
Nearly one-third of product failures
were associated with baby carriers,
which included instances of handle
detachment and product collapse.
Baby carrier seats, especially
detachable car seats, should be
carefully inspected before infant
transport. Any supporting devices
and carrier handles should be
locked into position before moving
an infant or child.37 Carrier seats also
pose an additional hazard of injuries
due to unattended falls, which
are associated with placement
of seats on elevated surfaces.34,

38
Infants in carrier seats should
always be secured using the safety
harness straps provided, and carriers
should be equipped with nonskid
undersides. Caregivers should
not place carrier seats on slippery
surfaces, such as glass tables, or on
soft surfaces, such as beds, where a
tip over could lead to suffocation.37
Cribs/mattresses were the second
most common source of injury and
were associated with the majority of
nursery product­related fatalities.
Previous literature provides evidence
that cribs are a leading nursery
product associated with infant
mortality.15,

22,

39 It is likely that
sudden unexpected infant death
accounted for many of these fatalities
in our study as well as in others.
Sleep environment hazards play a
key role in infant injury, especially
sudden unexpected infant death,
and health care practitioners should
counsel caregivers to not place
bumper pads or soft objects, such
as blankets or pillows, in the crib
because of the risk of strangulation,
entrapment, and suffocation.36,37
Caregivers should only use the firm,
snugly fitting mattress designed
for their crib and never use
supplemental mattresses, which may
increase the risk of entrapment and
suffocation.
Crib bumper pads have been
marketed as protective barriers to
reduce entrapment injuries, and
some organizations, such as the
Juvenile Products Manufacturers
Association, maintain that bumper
pads are safe.40 However, multiple
fatalities attributable to bumper pad­
related suffocation or strangulation
have been reported.41,

42 Since 2011,
the American Academy of Pediatrics
has recommended against bumper
pad use due to the risk of injury.43,44
The city of Chicago45 and the state
of Maryland46 have taken these
recommendations further, banning
the sale of bumper pads. Despite
these public policy efforts, bumper
pads can still be found in Chicago,
47
and more needs to be done at the
national level to limit the sale and use
of crib bumper pads.
Strollers/carriages were the
third-leading source of nursery
product­related injuries. Tip overs
and falls involving strollers have
been described as the predominant
mechanism of injury in the
literature,
12,

48,

49 underscoring the
need for caregivers to avoid taking
strollers on stairs, hanging objects
on stroller handles, and allowing
other children to play with or
hang onto a stroller while a child
is inside.36 These measures should
be combined with safety belt use,
which previous studies suggest is low
among injured children.49 In a report
describing stroller-related injuries in
Queensland, Australia, researchers
noted that 8% of fall injuries were
due to the stroller rolling away
from the caregiver.48 The injury risk
from stroller-roll-away could be
mitigated through the installation of
a "dead man brake,
" similar to those
on airport trolleys. Manufacturers
should be encouraged to place these
conditional braking systems on child
strollers and carriages.
Almost 90% of injuries occurred at
home, and 80% of injuries were due
to a fall. Therefore, prevention efforts
should focus on fall prevention in
the home setting. Strategies for
preventing falls include the following:
(1) use of products' safety devices,
such as a strap or harness; (2)
appropriate adult supervision; and
(3) proper assembly/installation and
use of products, such as adjusting the
mattress height in a crib to prevent
a child from climbing out. We also
found that young children were more
likely to injure their head and neck or
be diagnosed with a concussion/CHI,
whereas older children were more
likely to injure an upper extremity or
be diagnosed with a laceration. This
finding is most like due to children's
developmental changes and how
this development specifically affects
how they fall. Young children have
disproportionately large heads,
which provides a larger target for
injury and also raises their center
of gravity. These children tend to
lead with their head when they fall
and are unable to break their fall
with their arms because of lack of
coordination and strength. As they
get older, they use their arms more
effectively to protect their heads but
have more upper extremity injuries
as a result.32

PEDIATRICS Volume 139, number 4, April 2017
Several limitations exist in this study.
The number of nursery product­
related injuries was underestimated
because only cases treated in EDs
were included. Injuries treated
in urgent care centers and other
non-ED medical facilities are not
captured by the NEISS. Fatalities
are also underreported in the
NEISS because prehospital deaths
may not be transported to an ED,
and fatal patient outcomes after
hospital admission are not captured
in the NEISS database. The findings
of this study, therefore, may not
be representative of all nursery
product­related injuries. In addition,
NEISS case narratives are limited by
the amount of detail included in ED
medical records. Narratives may not
consistently provide information
about injury mechanism, factors
contributing to the injury event,
and which product was primarily
involved in the injury if multiple
products were listed. Information
regarding socioeconomic status was
unavailable. It is possible that some
of these injuries were the result
of child maltreatment. Because
multivariate analyses were not
performed, our results do not reflect
the potential influence of covariates
on the relationships examined.
Despite these limitations, the
strength of this study lies in its use
of a large, nationally representative
sample over a period of 21 years
that includes product-specific
information.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this study
is the first to use a nationally
representative database to examine
pediatric injuries associated with
a wide array of nursery products.
Although nursery product­related
injuries declined from 1991 to
2003, primarily due to successful
injury prevention efforts with baby
walkers, these injuries increased
during the final 8 years of the study
(2003­2011). Greater efforts are
warranted to prevent injuries
associated with other nursery
products, especially baby carriers,
cribs, and strollers. Prevention of falls
and concussions/CHIs associated
with nursery products also deserves
special attention. Future studies that
further examine the circumstances of
nursery product­related injuries and
evaluate current safety interventions
are needed to help inform the
development of effective prevention
strategies.
