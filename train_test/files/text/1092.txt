OUTPATIENT USE OF DRUG
therapies in the United
States is common and may
confer serious risks along
with substantial therapeutic ben-
efits.1,2 Historically, the public health
burden of adverse events from thera-
peutic drug use among community-
dwelling, nonhospitalized patients has
been difficult to estimate, but the prob-
lem is large and can be expected to in-
crease.3-5 In 2004, 82% of the US popu-
lation reported using at least 1
prescription medication, over-the-
counter medication, or dietary supple-
ment in the previous week and 30% re-
ported using 5 or more of these drugs.1
Outpatient drug use will likely in-
crease due to an aging population, the
trend toward outpatient service deliv-
ery, the development of new prescrip-
tion medications, the transition of
prescription medications to over-the-
counter availability, and the increas-
ing use of drugs for chemoprevention.
The recent implementation of the new
Medicare prescription drug coverage
benefit is designed to provide benefi-
ciaries with additional financial sup-
port to help ensure their continued ac-
cess to drug treatments,6 which may
further increase outpatient drug use.
These trends underscore the need for
ongoing surveillance of outpatient drug
safety. Although much attention and ef-
fort have been directed to measuring,
understanding, and preventing ad-
verse drug events (ADEs) in hospital-
ized patients,7,8 less attention has been
focused on ADEs occurring outside of
health care facilities. This is due in part
to the difficulty of obtaining timely, na-
tionally representative surveillance data
on outpatient ADEs.9

tient drug safety, the Centers for Dis-

Context Adverse drug events are common and often preventable causes of medical
injuries. However, timely, nationally representative information on outpatient ad-
verse drug events is limited.
Objective To describe the frequency and characteristics of adverse drug events that
lead to emergency department visits in the United States.
Design, Setting, and Participants Active surveillance from January 1, 2004, through
December 31, 2005, through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System­
Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project.
Main Outcome Measures National estimates of the numbers, population rates,
and severity (measured by hospitalization) of individuals with adverse drug events treated
in emergency departments.
Results Over the 2-year study period, 21 298 adverse drug event cases were reported,
producing weighted annual estimates of 701 547 individuals (95% confidence interval
[CI], 509 642-893 452) or 2.4 individuals per 1000 population (95% CI, 1.7-3.0) treated
in emergency departments. Of these cases, 3487 individuals required hospitalization
(annual estimate, 117 318 [16.7%]; 95% CI, 13.1%-20.3%). Adverse drug events ac-
counted for 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.1%) of estimated emergency department visits for
all unintentional injuries and 6.7% (95% CI, 4.7%-8.7%) of those leading to hospi-
talizationandaccountedfor0.6%ofestimatedemergencydepartmentvisitsforallcauses.
Individuals aged 65 years or older were more likely than younger individuals to sustain
adverse drug events (annual estimate, 4.9 vs 2.0 per 1000; rate ratio [RR], 2.4; 95% CI,
1.8-3.0)andmorelikelytorequirehospitalization(annualestimate,1.6vs0.23per1000;
RR, 6.8; 95% CI, 4.3-9.2). Drugs for which regular outpatient monitoring is used to pre-
ventacutetoxicityaccountedfor41.5%ofestimatedhospitalizationsoverall(1381cases;
95% CI, 30.9%-52.1%) and 54.4% of estimated hospitalizations among individuals
aged 65 years or older (829 cases; 95% CI, 45.0%-63.7%).
Conclusions Adverse drug events among outpatients that lead to emergency de-
partment visits are an important cause of morbidity in the United States, particularly
among individuals aged 65 years or older. Ongoing, population-based surveillance can
help monitor these events and target prevention strategies.

Administration(FDA)developedtheNa-
tionalElectronicInjurySurveillanceSys-
tem­Cooperative Adverse Drug Event
Surveillance project (NEISS-CADES).
We report data from the first 2 years of
NEISS-CADES to estimate and describe
the national burden of ADEs that led to
emergency department (ED) visits.
METHODS
Setting and Population
The 63 hospitals participating in the Na-
tionalElectronicInjurySurveillanceSys-
tem­AllInjuryProgram(NEISS-AIP)are
a nationally representative, stratified
probability sample of all hospitals (ex-
cluding psychiatric and penal institu-
tions) in the United States and its terri-
tories, with a minimum of 6 beds and a
24-hour ED.10 There are 4 size strata
(very large, large, medium, and small)
based on the number of annual ED vis-
its and 1 children's hospital stratum.
The CPSC and CDC jointly train cod-
ers located at each hospital who review
clinical records of every ED visit to iden-
tify all initial visits for injuries, poison-
ings, and ADEs. Approximately 500000
injury-related ED visits are reported to
NEISS-AIP each year. Participation by
hospitals in NEISS-AIP is voluntary and
confidentiality of all data is ensured by
theConsumerProductSafetyAct.11 Data
collection, management, quality assur-
ance, and analyses were determined to
be public health surveillance activities
by CDC and FDA human subjects over-
sight bodies and therefore did not re-
quire human subject review or institu-
tional review board approval.
Case Definition
and Data Collection
FortheCooperativeAdverseDrugEvent
Surveillance (CADES) component of
NEISS-AIP, an adverse drug event case
is defined as an incident ED visit for a
condition that the treating physician ex-
plicitly attributed to the use of a drug or
a drug-specific effect. Coders are in-
structed to examine the physician diag-
noses recorded in the clinical record. If
aconditionisspecificallylinkedtoadrug
in this section, then the case is in-
cluded. If a diagnosis describes a condi-
tion commonly related to drug effects
(eg, bleeding, hypoglycemia) coders ex-
amine other sections of the clinical rec-
ord for evidence that the condition is, in
fact, drug-related (eg, documentation of
supratherapeutic international normal-
ized ratio [INR] in a patient taking an-
ticoagulants, documentation of insulin
use in a patient with hypoglycemia).
Drugs include prescription or over-
the-counter (OTC) medications; vac-
cines; and vitamins, dietary supple-
ments, and herbal products. (In its
organizations, operations, and regula-
tions, the FDA distinguishes drug prod-
uctsfromvaccines,vitamins,anddietary
supplements.Drugsandvaccinesrequire
FDA approval before they can be sold;
vitamins and dietary supplements do
not.)Alcoholicbeverages,tobaccoprod-
ucts,andillicitsubstancesareexcluded.
Adverse events include allergic re-
actions (immunologically mediated
effects)12; adverse effects (undesirable
pharmacologic or idiosyncratic effects at
recommended doses)12; unintentional
overdoses (toxic effects linked to ex-
cessdoseorimpairedexcretion)12;orsec-
ondary effects (eg, falls, choking). In-
tentionalself-harm(eg,suicideattempts),
drug therapeutic failures, drug with-
drawal,anddrugabuseareexcluded.Ad-
verse drug events that occur as a result
ofmedicaltreatmentreceivedduringthe
ED visit are excluded. Follow-up visits
for an ADE previously diagnosed and
treated are also excluded.
After identifying ADE cases,
NEISS-AIP coders transcribe physician
diagnoses and abstract from the clinical
record the reason for visit, diagnostic
tests, therapies administered, and the
name,dose,route,frequency,anddura-
tion of use for up to 2 drugs associated
with the adverse event. Coders also rec-
ord up to 10 concomitant drugs as well
ascoreNEISS-AIPdataelementssuchas
patient demographics and a narrative
description of the incident. NEISS-AIP
coders use a computer-based data entry
system to transmit case reports to CPSC

Outcome Measures
In this study, an ED visit for an ADE
was the primary outcome measure. A
secondary clinical outcome was ADE
severity as measured by the need for
hospitalization following ED evalua-
tion. Hospitalization includes admis-
sion to an inpatient unit of that facil-
ity, admission to the ED for observation,
or transfer to another facility for acute
medical care. NEISS data, including
ADE data, are not used for national es-
timates of deaths. Details about event
circumstances are often lacking when
patients are dead on arrival or die soon
after arrival in the ED, and such cases
are incompletely captured across ED
record systems. Therefore, deaths from
ADEs occurring in the out-of-hospital
setting, in the ED, or after hospital ad-
mission are not reported.

range:insulins,oralhypoglycemicagents,
warfarin, digitalis glycosides, pheny-
toin,carbamazepine,divalproex,primi-
done, lithium, and theophylline.
Statistical Analysis
Each NEISS-AIP case is assigned a
sample weight based on the inverse
probability of selection.10 These weights
were summed and the sum divided by
2 to determine annual national esti-
mates of ADEs in the period 2004-
2005. Population ADE rates were cal-
culated using 2004 and 2005 US
population estimates from the US Cen-
sus Bureau17,18 and were considered free
of sampling error. Estimates and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calcu-
lated using the surveymeans proce-
dure in SAS version 9.1 to account for
the sample weights and complex sample
design (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Estimates of less than 1200 individu-
als, based on fewer than 20 cases, or
with coefficients of variation (CVs)
greater than 30% may be unstable19 and
are indicated in the tables.
RESULTS
Based on 21 298 ADE cases reported,
we estimated that 701 547 US patients
(95%CI,509642-893452)weretreated
annually for ADEs in EDs in 2004 and
2005. Of these, 3487 case patients were
hospitalized (annual estimate, 117 318
[16.7%]; 95% CI, 13.1%-20.3%). The
hospitalized cases included 2932 ad-
mitted to an inpatient unit of the facil-
ity (annual estimate, 13.8%; 95% CI,
10.5%-17.1%), 385 held in the ED as
observation admissions (annual esti-
mate, 1.9%; 95% CI, 0.5%-3.4%), and
170 transferred to another health care
facility (annual estimate, 1.0%; 95% CI,
0.7%-1.3%).
Based on 922 196 unintentional in-
jury and ADE cases reported to
NEISS-AIP, 2.5% (95% CI, 2.0%-
3.1%) of estimated ED visits were due
to ADEs and 6.7% (95% CI, 4.7%-
8.7%) of estimated hospitalizations for
unintentionalinjurieswereduetoADEs
(TABLE 1). Patients aged 65 years or
older comprised 10.8% of all esti-
mated unintentional injury visits (95%
CI, 9.6%-12.1%) but 25.3% of esti-
mated ADE visits (95% CI, 20.2%-
30.4%). Patients aged 65 years or older
accounted for 37.0% of estimated un-
intentional injury visits requiring hos-
pitalization (95% CI, 31.8%-42.2%) but
48.9% of estimated ADE visits requir-
ing hospitalization (95% CI, 40.0%-
57.8%). While most ED visits for un-
intentional injuries overall were among

men (annual estimate, 54.6%; 95% CI,
53.7%-55.5%), most ED visits for ADEs
were among women (annual estimate,
60.6%; 95% CI, 59.1%-62.1%). Based
on 4 451 726 total ED visits reported to
NEISS (annual estimate, 120 490 979
visits), ADEs led to 0.6% of estimated
ED visits for all causes.
The estimated annual population rate
of ADEs treated in EDs was 2.4 per 1000
individuals (95% CI, 1.7-3.0). In in-
fants and children younger than 5 years,
the estimated annual rate of ADEs (4.3
per 1000; 95% CI, 3.1-5.4) was higher
than the estimated annual rate for the
general population rate but dropped
among children aged 5 through 9 years
(1.0 per 1000; 95% CI, 0.7-1.3)
(FIGURE). The estimated annual rate of
ADEs began to exceed the general
population rate again in adults aged 60
through 64 years (2.9 per 1000; 95%
CI, 1.9-3.9) and continued to increase
with age until peaking at 6.8 per 1000
for adults aged 85 years or older (95%
CI, 3.6-10.1). The estimated annual rate
of ADEs for individuals aged 65 years
or older was more than twice the rate
for those younger than 65 years (4.9 per
1000; 95% CI, 2.7-7.0 vs 2.0 per 1000;
95% CI, 1.6-2.5) (rate ratio [RR], 2.4;
95% CI, 1.8-3.0). Overall, the esti-
mated annual population rate of ADEs
requiring subsequent hospitalization
was 0.4 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.2-0.6). For
persons aged 65 years or older, the es-
timated annual population rate of ADEs
requiring hospitalization was nearly 7
times the rate for persons younger than
65 years (1.6 per 1000; 95% CI, 0.7-
2.5 vs 0.23 per 1000; 95% CI, 0.15-
0.31) (RR, 6.8; 95% CI, 4.3-9.2).
The most common conditions caused
byADEsweredermatologic,gastrointes-
tinal, and neurological conditions
(TABLE 2). Most adverse events mani-
fested as a single type of condition
(14 137 cases; annual estimate, 64.1%;
95% CI, 61.0%-67.4%). A quarter of ad-
verse events involved 2 types of condi-
tions (5353 cases; annual estimate,
26.6%; 95% CI, 25.0%-28.2%). Fewer
adverse events involved 3 or more con-
ditions (1808 cases; annual estimate,
9.3%; 95% CI, 7.0%-11.7%).
One third of estimated ED visits were
attributed to allergic reactions (33.5%;
95% CI, 28.6%-38.4%), and one third
were attributed to unintentional over-
doses (32.1%; 95% CI, 28.6%-35.7%)
(TABLE 3). Most of the estimated hos-
pitalizations were attributed to unin-

tentional overdoses (53.4%; 95% CI,
46.9%-59.9%), while allergic reac-
tions accounted for 11.3% (95% CI,
6.1%-16.4%). The estimated propor-
tion of patients hospitalized following
unintentional overdoses (27.8%; 95%
CI, 22.3%-33.3%) was 5 times greater
than the estimated proportion hospi-
talized due to allergic reactions (5.6%;
95% CI, 3.5%-7.7%).
Drugs that commonly require regu-
lar outpatient monitoring to prevent
acute toxicity (antidiabetic agents, war-
farin, several anticonvulsants, digitalis
glycosides, theophylline, and lithium)
were involved in most unintentional
overdoses (3387 cases; annual esti-

These drugs were implicated in 66.0%
of estimated overdoses requiring hospi-

years or older, these drugs that com-
monly require regular monitoring were

Eighteen drugs were implicated alone
or in combination with other drugs in
1% or more of estimated ADEs
(TABLE 5). Insulins or warfarin, drugs
that typically require ongoing monitor-
ing to prevent overdose or toxicity, were
implicated in 1 in every 7 estimated
ADEs treated in EDs (14.1%; 95% CI,
9.6%-18.6%). Seven of these drugs were
antibiotics, and together these antibiot-
ics were implicated in 1 in every 8 esti-
mated ADE treated in EDs (13.0%; 95%

cated in more than one quarter of all
estimated hospitalizations (871 cases;
95% CI, 17.3%-35.2%) while the 7 an-
tibiotics were implicated in only 3.8%
of hospitalizations (121 cases; 95% CI,
2.7%-5.0%). Among patients aged 65
years or older, 3 drugs that typically re-
quire ongoing monitoring (insulin, war-
farin, and digoxin) were implicated in
1 in every 3 estimated ADEs treated in
EDs(1592cases;33.3%;95%CI,27.8%-
38.7%) and 41.5% of estimated hospi-
talizations (646 cases; 95% CI, 32.4%-
50.6%).
COMMENT
Based on data from a nationally repre-
sentative surveillance system, we esti-
mate that more than 700 000 patients
were treated for ADEs in US EDs an-
nually in 2004 and 2005, and 1 of ev-
ery 6 required subsequent hospital ad-
mission, transfer to another health care
facility, or ED observation admission.
Individuals aged 65 years or older were
more than twice as likely to be treated
in EDs for an ADE and nearly 7 times
as likely to require hospitalization as in-
dividuals younger than 65 years.
Among all patients who were hospital-
ized, most ADEs were due to uninten-
tional overdoses and two thirds of these
were due to toxicity from a relatively
small set of drugs for which regular
monitoring is commonly required to
prevent acute toxicity. Sixteen of the 18
drugs most commonly causing ADEs
have been in clinical use for more than
20 years.20
These population-based surveil-
lance data help define the national scope
of the outpatient ADE problem, under-
score the need for intensified preven-
tion efforts, and identify areas in which
to focus interventions for the greatest
public health impact. The finding
that individuals aged 65 years or older
(12% of the US population) ac-
counted for one quarter of ADEs over-
all and half of adverse events requir-
ing hospitalization highlights the
importance of directing ADE preven-
tion efforts to this vulnerable popula-
tion. Emergency department visits for
ADEs in this age group were nearly as
common as those for motor vehicle oc-
cupant injuries.21
Important underlying factors con-
tribute to the disproportionate effect of
ADEs on individuals aged 65 years or
older (eg, greater frequency and num-
ber of drugs used by this age group, age-
related physiologic changes). How-
ever, the finding that just 3 drugs
(warfarin, insulin, and digoxin), with
narrow therapeutic index and high risk
of overdose or toxicity, caused nearly
one third of ED-treated ADEs in pa-
tients aged 65 years or older provides
further focus for prevention efforts. A
recent study found that high propor-
tions of ambulatory patients taking
drugs with a narrow therapeutic range
had no serum concentration monitor-

interventions designed to prevent these
specific ADEs, such as patient educa-
tion programs, patient self-manage-
ment, and specialist management, have
long been available but use of these in-
terventions varies.23 The data from our
study emphasize the national scope of
the adverse health outcomes due to out-
patient ADEs that could be addressed
through targeted implementation of
current safety interventions.
WecomparedthemagnitudeofADEs

tional injuries because an injury-

framework for understanding and pre-
ventingawiderangeofharmfulevents.24

outpatient ADEs as an interaction of an
agent(drug),ahost(patient),andtheen-
vironment(physicalandsocial)canhelp
conceptualize injury-based approaches
for preventing or ameliorating outpa-
tient ADEs.29
The population-based surveillance
data we report are consistent with find-
ings from studies in single institu-
tions,30,31 studies in Medicare enroll-
ees,23 and contention of drug safety
analysts that a large proportion of the
public health burden of ADEs is attrib-
utable to "older drugs, used poorly."32
Direct comparisons between surveil-
lance data from NEISS-CADES and pre-
vious reports on outpatient ADEs are
limited by differences in case defini-
tions and outcomes evaluated. For ex-
ample, some ED-based studies have in-
cluded drug abuse, suicide attempts,
noncomplianceornonadherence,thera-
peutic failures of drugs or inadequate
drug therapy, and adverse events from
drugs given during ED visits.33 Other
studies of outpatient ADEs have mea-
sured a range of outcomes including pa-
tient self-reported symptoms,34 poten-
tial ADEs,35 and assessments of
severity.31 Nevertheless,studiesofsingle
EDs30 and studies of ADEs in a local
Medicare population36 have found simi-
lar types of adverse effects and impli-
cated many of the same drugs and drug
classes. Zhan et al37 recently analyzed
data from one source of nationally rep-
resentative outpatient ADE data, the
National Hospital Ambulatory Medi-
cal Care Survey (NHAMCS), and re-
ported a similar rate of ED visits for
ADEs (1.9 to 2.8 per 1000 for 1995
through 2001). However, this analy-
sis was limited to pooled data for a
6-year study period to describe pa-
tient characteristics and broad drug cat-
egories based on International Classifi-
cation of Diseases coding.
NEISS-CADES has several advan-
tages compared with other sources
of ADE information. Because
NEISS-CADES collects data from a
nationally representative sample of
hospital EDs, data are not subject to
the questions of generalizability as
are data collected from single institu-
tions or single geographic areas.30
Moreover, compared with many
research studies and population sur-
veys, NEISS-CADES data collection
is timely, with preliminary data typi-
cally available within several weeks
of the ED visit.13 NEISS-CADES data
collection is ongoing, enabling trend
monitoring and evaluation of
national safety interventions not pos-
sible with research studies that typi-
cally have defined study periods. In
addition, although NEISS-CADES
recently began operation, it will
likely be less susceptible than volun-
tary reporting systems to variations
in reporting rates over time,38 just as
the parent surveillance system,
NEISS, has produced stable estimates
of consumer product-related injuries
for more than 3 decades.19,39
Adverse drug event surveillance with
NEISS-CADES has several limitations
that likely result in an underestimate
of the outpatient ADE burden. First,
NEISS-CADES is restricted to ED pa-
tients. Cases of ADEs diagnosed and
treated in other settings (eg, primary
care offices, non­hospital-based ur-
gent care centers, or directly admitted
to hospitals) or not treated in any health
care facility will not be captured.
Second, some ADEs that lead to ED
visits, such as effects of chronic drug
exposure, adverse effects manifested by
the gradual onset of symptoms, and un-
common adverse effects, may be un-
recognized by ED physicians and there-
fore may be undetected.
Third, because NEISS-CADES re-
lies on documentation of ADEs by the
treating physician, it is likely less sen-
sitive than research studies involving
chart review by specially trained phar-
macists or physicians, computer-
generated signals, patient interview, or
combination approaches to identify un-
diagnosed or unreported ADEs.40
Fourth, NEISS-CADES could be bi-
ased toward detecting acute, well-

known drug effects or effects for which
testing is available in the ED, such as
hypoglycemia from insulin overdose or
hypocoagulability due to warfarin.
However, in an evaluation of 6
NEISS-CADES hospitals, these events
were found to be underreported rather
than overreported. Excluding these
events improved the sensitivity of ADE
identification from 33% to 45%.14 How-
ever, the weighted positive predictive
value in this evaluation for coder-
reported ADEs was 92%.14 Although
this estimate of sensitivity for 6 of the
participating hospitals may appear low,
it is considerably higher than volun-
tary reporting, which often captures less
than1%ofseriousadversereactionsand
rarely captures more than 10%.38 Ef-
forts to improve the sensitivity of ADE
identification are part of the ongoing
NEISS-CADES quality assurance pro-
cess, and reassessments of ADE iden-
tification are planned.
And fifth, while ADE surveillance
with NEISS-CADES provides informa-
tion on outpatient ADEs treated in
EDs, the NEISS-CADES data are insuf-
ficient to provide a complete perspec-
tive on outpatient ADEs. For instance,
we did not estimate the total number
of fatalities from outpatient ADEs
because NEISS-CADES does not cap-
ture prehospital deaths or deaths in
the ED. Moreover, although calculat-
ing the proportion of ADEs relative to
that drug's use can provide informa-
tion on relative risks for comparison
with other drugs, we did not report
such calculations because estimates of
national outpatient drug use are not
available from NEISS-CADES data. In
addition, we did not attempt to cat-
egorize ADEs by "preventability" or
the presence of a medication "error" in
this investigation. Further examina-
tion of the data collected through this
ED-based public health surveillance
system is needed to determine if the
clinical details are available for such
categorization.
We expected national estimates of
uncommon events (eg, estimates of
1200 per year or estimates based on
fewer than 20 cases) to have CVs
greater than 30%; however, several
national estimates of ADE estimates
were based on relatively large num-
bers of cases but also had CVs greater
than 30% (eg, warfarin with 1234
cases, CV=32.5%). This situation can
occur for estimates generated from a
probability sample, such as NEISS,
when the underlying distribution of
the condition under surveillance is not
evenly distributed across the popula-
tion. For example, NEISS estimates of
ED visits for snow-skiing injuries have
elevated CVs because hospitals in
mountainous northern states have
high numbers of visits for these inju-
ries while hospitals in coastal southern
states have low numbers of visits.
Drug selection,41-43 disease monitor-
ing,44,45 therapeutic outcomes,46 and
adverse outcomes47 have all been
shown to vary by hospital and geo-
graphic area. These variations in clini-
cal practice likely contribute to varia-
tion in the number of ADEs treated at
NEISS hospitals, resulting in CVs
greater than 30% for some estimates
presented in this study. A recent sys-
tematic review reported that antico-
agulation control varied extensively
among study settings,48 so it is not
unreasonable that adverse events from
anticoagulants might vary among the
catchment areas served by NEISS hos-
pitals. Other possible explanations for
elevated CVs include variability in the
level of detail in clinical documenta-
tion or variability in data collection
across NEISS hospitals. Because ADEs
are typically underdocumented,40 and
an evaluation of NEISS-CADES data
collection found a high positive pre-
dictive value,14 variability due to docu-
mentation or data collection practices
would likely increase these national
estimates.
Efforts to reduce the burden of out-
patient ADEs have been hampered by
sparse data, except in selected health
care systems or settings.3 Ongoing data
collection in NEISS-CADES will en-
able more detailed examination of the
epidemiology of ED-treated outpa-
tient ADEs, focusing on specific pa-
tient populations, drug classes, condi-
tions, and circumstances. Identifying
appropriate measures of drug expo-
sure and evaluating drug risks in rela-
tion to drug benefits remain impor-
tant challenges in improving the quality
of outpatient drug therapy. In the fu-
ture, data from electronic health records
may provide national, real-time data on
outpatient drug safety.40 Until then, le-
veraging existing public health surveil-
lance systems provides a feasible, cost-
efficient way to monitor the national
health burden of outpatient drug safety
problems and helps target prevention
strategies tailored to the specific events
of greatest population burden.
