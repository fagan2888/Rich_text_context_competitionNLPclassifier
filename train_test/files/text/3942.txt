Jing Liu1, Hai-Ying Cao2 and Wei Fu1,3
Abstract
Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of lung ultrasonography for neonatal meconium
aspiration syndrome (MAS).
Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients diagnosed with MAS based on
medical history, clinical manifestations and chest X-ray and control newborns without MAS. During
ultrasonography, each lung was divided into three regions (front, lateral, and back), using anterior
and posterior axillary lines as the boundary. While scanning each region of the lungs, the hand piece
was perpendicular or parallel to the ribs.
Results: This study enrolled 117 newborns with MAS and 100 controls. The main lung
ultrasonographic findings in patients with MAS were: (i) pulmonary consolidation with air
bronchogram was found in all patients; (ii) pleural line anomalies and the disappearance of the
A-line was found in all patients; (iii) atelectasis was found in 19 (16.2%) severe cases, who
demonstrated severe massive atelectasis and visible lung pulse; (iv) pleural effusion was found in
16 patients (13.7%); and (v) alveolar-interstitial syndrome or B-line in the non-consolidation area
was found in all patients with MAS.
Conclusion: Ultrasonography can be used routinely to diagnose MAS in an accurate, reliable,
convenient, and non-invasive manner.

Introduction
Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a
common cause of severe respiratory distress
in neonates especially in full-term or post-
term infants, with an associated highly
variable morbidity and mortality.1 MAS
accounts for about 10% of all cases of
respiratory failure with a 39% mortality
rate in developing and newly industrialized
countries.1 Early diagnosis and early treat-
ment are important for improving the prog-
nosis.2­4 Historically, MAS has been mainly
diagnosed based on medical history, clinical
manifestations, and chest X-ray, and ultra-
sonography has not been used as a diag-
nostic tool. In recent years, however,
ultrasonography has been used successfully
to diagnose many types of lung diseases,
such as neonatal respiratory distress syn-
drome (RDS), transient tachypnoea of the
newborn, pneumonia, and atelectasis.5­9
This previous experience showed that lung
ultrasonography is an accurate and reliable
method for the early diagnosis and identifi-
cation of neonatal lung diseases. This pre-
sent study investigated the diagnostic value
of lung ultrasonography for MAS, as well as
presenting the ultrasonographic characteris-
tics of MAS.
Patients and methods
Patients
This prospective observational study
enrolled consecutive patients who were
admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit, Bayi Children's Hospital, the Army
General Hospital of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, Beijing, China and diag-
nosed with MAS based on medical history,
clinical manifestations, arterial blood gas
analysis and chest X-ray between January
2014 and August 2015. Those patients with
MAS and the complications of pneumo-
thorax and/or pneumomediastinum were
excluded from the study. The diagnostic
criteria for MAS were as follows:1,10
(i) respiratory distress with elevated oxygen
dependence; (ii) presence of meconium in the
amniotic fluid; (iii) the classic radiographic
findings in MAS, which are overexpansion
of the lungs with widespread coarse, massive
bilateral patchy infiltrates with or without
pleural fluid; and (iv) abnormal blood gas
analysis results. A group of newborns with-
out lung and heart disease who were hospi-
talized at Bayi Children's Hospital during
the same time period and who underwent
lung ultrasonography were used as the con-
trol subjects.
This study obtained approval from
the Ethics Committee of the Army General
Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (no. 2011-LC-Ped-01). The parents of
the patients and control subjects participat-
ing in the study provided verbal informed
consent.
Ultrasonography methods
A VolusonTM E8 or a LOGICTM C9
ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used with a
hand piece frequency of 10­14 MHz.
Newborns were placed in a supine, lateral
or prone position while at rest. During
ultrasonography, each lung was divided
into three regions (front, lateral and back),
using anterior and posterior axillary lines as
the boundary. While scanning each region of
the lungs, the hand piece was perpendicular
or parallel to the ribs. The lung ultrasonog-
raphy examinations were performed by one
physician (J.L.), while the clinical data were
collected by different physicians, and the
ultrasound operator was blinded to the
clinical condition of the neonates. The lung
ultrasound for MAS patients was performed
on admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care
Unit or within 2 h after receiving mechanical
ventilation. The lung ultrasound for control
newborns was performed by the same phys-
ician (J.L.) on admission to hospital.

Observational indices
The observational indices included pleural
lines, lung sliding, A-lines, B-lines, intersti-
tial syndrome, white lung, lung consoli-
dation with air bronchogram or fluid
bronchogram, double lung point, and
pleural effusion.11­15
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Fisher's exact test was used to
compare the rate of positive neonatal ultra-
sound findings between the two groups. The
specificity and sensitivity of the primary
examination results for diagnosing MAS
were calculated based on this test. A
P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
A total of 117 paediatric patients diagnosed
with MAS based on typical medical history,
clinical manifestations, abnormal blood gas
analysis results and chest X-ray findings
were enrolled in this study and underwent
lung ultrasonography. Their gestational age
ranged from 35þ5 to 42þ3 weeks (including
seven late preterm newborns); 69 were male,
and 48 were female. Sixty-six newborns were
delivered vaginally, and 51 were delivered
via caesarean section. Their birth weight
ranged from 2280 to 5010 g. A total of 100
newborns with no lung diseases were
included in the control group; 59 were
male, and 41 were female. Among the
controls, 57 were delivered vaginally, and
43 were delivered via caesarean section.
Their gestational age ranged from 35þ2 to
41þ5 weeks and their birth weight ranged
from 2550 to 4780 g, which were similar to
those of the MAS patients.
In normal lung tissue, the pleural line and
A-line were clear, parallel and equally spaced,
with smooth, clear and regular high echoes.
The lung sliding was clearly present, with no
or a few B-lines. B-lines were found in 25 of
the 100 newborns; and at follow-up at 2­3
weeks after birth, five of them still had
significant B-lines. There was no pleural
effusion or lung consolidation (Figure 1).
In this study, the main lung ultrasono-
graphic findings in MAS patients were as
follows: (i) lung consolidation with air
bronchogram was found in all patients,
usually with a large consolidation area
with irregular edges (Figures 2 and 3). The
lung consolidation area varied between the
lungs, and different sizes of consolidation
area were present in the same lung (Figures 4
and 5); (ii) pleural line anomalies and the
Figure 1. Normal neonatal lung ultrasonographic
appearance of the right lung of a newborn in the
control group. In normal newborns without lung
disease, the lungs were hypoechoic; the pleural line
and A-line were hyperechoic, clear, smooth, regular,
and parallel and equally spaced, and the echoes
gradually became weaker and eventually dis-
appeared as the pleural line and the A-line extended
deep into the lungs.

amniotic fluid, asphyxia at birth, and difficulty breathing after resuscitation. Lung ultrasonography showed
large areas of pulmonary consolidation with air bronchogram and irregular edges in the lungs, especially in the
right lung. The pleural line was abnormal, and the A-line disappeared in the consolidation area. Chest X-ray
showed patchy and cloudy shadows that were consistent with MAS.

newborn was delivered at 39þ6 weeks of gestation via a vaginal birth, weighted 3350 g and presented with fetal
distress, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, and decreased amniotic fluid. At 37 weeks, the umbilical cord
was wrapped twice around the feet and was twisted. Apgar scores at birth were 7, 10, and 10 points at 1, 5,
and 10 min, respectively, and heart rate was < 80 beats per min. There was no premature rupture of the fetal
membranes according to the patient's family. The newborn had difficulty breathing after birth. The patient
was transferred to our hospital with endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation. Lung
ultrasonography showed large areas of pulmonary consolidation with irregular edges in the lungs, especially
in the right lung.

patient had large areas of pulmonary consolidation with air bronchogram shown on lung ultrasonography; two
consolidation areas of different sizes are shown in the right lung, the pleural line blurred or disappeared, and
the A-line disappeared.

disappearance of the A-line was found in all
patients. Pleural line anomalies presented as
the disappearance of the pleural line or as
thickened and blurred pleural lines in the
lesions (Figures 1­4); (iii) atelectasis is a
manifestation of severe lung consolidation
that was found in 19 severe cases (16.2%) in
this study (Figure 6). These patients showed
severe massive atelectasis and visible lung
pulse. All of the patients with atelectasis had
an absence of lung sliding; (iv) pleural
effusion was found in 16 patients (13.7%)
in this study (Figure 6); (v) alveolar-inter-
stitial syndrome (AIS) or B-line in the non-
consolidation area was found in all patients
with MAS (Table 1).
Based on the results of this study, lung
consolidation with irregular margins were
the common and specific ultrasound find-
ings of MAS. Therefore, this study used the
presence of lung consolidation with irregular
margins as a parameter for calculating the
sensitivity (a/aþc) and specificity (d/b þ d)
of ultrasonography for diagnosing MAS.
The results indicate this sign exhibited both
a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in
diagnosing MAS (Table 2).
Discussion
The incidence of meconium staining of the
amniotic fluid (MSAF) increases with ges-
tational age. For example, the overall inci-
dence of MSAF is approximately 12%,
while the incidence is 30% at gestational
ages of >42 weeks; < 2% at gestational ages
of <37 weeks; and rare at gestational ages
of <34 weeks.16,17 Meconium excretion is a
naturally occurring sign of the development
of the gastrointestinal tract. For fetuses with
mature nervous systems, umbilical cord
compression may cause transient parasym-
pathetic excitement and ensuing meconium
excretion. Fetal distress may also trigger
meconium excretion. After the baby is born
and starts to breathe on their own, they may
inhale meconium particles into the distal
airways. Should a large amount of thick

meconium be inhaled, the newborn may
develop severe difficulty breathing within
hours of birth, which may manifest as
cyanosis, nasal flaring, signs of three depres-
sions and shortness of breath and expiratory
groaning; and in severe cases, the baby may
die before birth or shortly after birth.
Therefore, early diagnosis is important for
guiding treatment and improving the
patient's prognosis. In the past, MAS was
mainly diagnosed based on typical medical
history, clinical manifestations, arterial
blood gas analysis, and X-ray. However,
many cases of MAS were misdiagnosed or
had delayed diagnoses.18,19
A previous study had described the lung
ultrasound signs in six patients with MAS,
which included: (i) B-pattern coalescent or
sparse; (ii) consolidations; (iii) atelectasis;
and (iv) bronchograms.20 The authors
reported that the lung ultrasound images
corresponded well with the X-ray findings.20
This present study demonstrated that lung
ultrasonography was accurate and reliable
for the diagnosis of MAS. Based on the
results of this study, the main ultrasono-
graphic characteristics of MAS were as
follows: (i) lung consolidation with air
bronchogram was found in all patients,
usually with a large consolidation area
with irregular edges. According to this pre-
sent study, the signs of lung consolidation
with irregular margins on ultrasonography
had a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity
for diagnosing MAS; (ii) there was variation
in the nature and extent of pulmonary
lesions between lungs or in the same lung.
The area of lung consolidation varied

between the lungs, and different sizes of
consolidated areas were present in the same
lung. A large consolidation was often seen in
severely affected patients, while small con-
solidations and confluent B-lines were often
seen in patients with less severe MAS;
(iii) atelectasis was found in a few (16.2%)
severe cases in this present study. Lung pulse
was observed in severe cases (8.5%). There
was an absence of lung sliding in all patients
with atelectasis; (iv) pleural line anomalies
were seen, including the disappearance of
the pleural line or thickened and blurred
pleural lines in the lesions; (v) the disappear-
ance of the A-line was observed; (vi) the
B-line or AIS was observed in the non-
consolidation area; (vii) pleural effusion was
found in 13.7% of patients in this present
study. However, these ultrasonographic
findings are also observed in lung diseases
such as RDS, pneumonia and atelectasis, so
they are not specific to MAS.5­7 In particu-
lar, large areas of pulmonary consolidation
with irregular edges are also observed on
lung ultrasonography in cases of pneumo-
nia,6 which is useful for differentiating
between MAS and other diseases. MAS
and pneumonia may be differentiated
because varying degrees of pulmonary con-
solidation are usually observed in both lungs
in MAS but only in one lung in pneumonia.
Previous research suggests that in normal
newborns a few B-lines may be present
within 24­36 hours of birth but should
disappear 48­72 hours after birth.14
However, this present study found that
B-lines may still be present in healthy new-
borns after 3 days, and even 2­3 weeks after
birth. This suggests that our knowledge and
understanding of lung ultrasonography, a
new technology, will deepen with more
in-depth research and clinical experience.
In conclusion, lung ultrasonography
appears to be an accurate, reliable, simple
and non-invasive technology for the diagno-
sis of MAS, which can be performed at the
bedside. Moreover, lung ultrasonography
can be readily performed and is suitable
for dynamic monitoring, and it can provide
timely and valuable medical information
when clinicians need to determine the
causes of sudden changes in the patient's
condition. In particular, lung ultrasonog-
raphy does not use radiation and thus
prevents radiation-related injury in the
patient, other patients in the same ward
and the medical staff.21 In addition, it is very
easy to distinguish MAS from other lung
diseases, such as transient tachypnoea of the
newborn, RDS, pneumonia, atelactesis, by
using lung ultrasound.5­8 Lung ultrasonog-
raphy could replace X-rays for the diagnosis
and differential diagnosis of common lung
diseases.22,23 In order for this new technol-
ogy to be used more effectively, medical staff
will require proper training in lung
ultrasonography.
