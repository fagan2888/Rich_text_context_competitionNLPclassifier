Objectives. Research has been oriented toward elucidating the links between religion and mental health. The pur-
pose of this article is to further our knowledge in this area by examining the effect of religious activity on depressive
symptomatology among community-dwelling elderly persons with cancer. We also test whether these effects differ be-
tween Blacks and Whites.
Methods. We use two waves of data collected from a community-dwelling sample of elderly persons living in North
Carolina. Depressive symptomatology is measured using four subscales from the CES-D 20 scale: somatic-retarded ac-
tivity, depressed affect, positive affect, and interpersonal relations. Measures of religious activity include service atten-
dance, religious devotion, and watching or listening to religious programs.
Results. The findings indicate that among Blacks with cancer, religious activity is related to lower levels of depres-
sive symptomatology; no such relationship is found for respondents with other illnesses or no illness. Further, the ef-
fects of religious activity are stronger among Blacks than Whites.
Discussion. The analyses lend support to the hypothesis that religious activity is a strong predictor of depression in
elderly adults with cancer. This finding, however, is not as strong as we had anticipated.
RESEARCH has explored the links between religion
. and mental health (Ellison, 1991; Koenig et al., 1992;
Pollner, 1989; Williams, Larson, Buckler, Heckmann, &
Pyle, 1991), physical and functional health (Idler, 1987;
Idler & Kasl, 1997; Mclntosh & Spilka, 1990), subjective
health (Broyles & Drenovsky, 1992; St. George & McNa-
mara, 1984), and mortality (Idler & Kasl, 1992; Oxman,
Freeman, & Manheimer, 1995). A subset of this research
has focused on the way religion functions for people who
are ill or functionally impaired (Idler, 1995).
The purpose of this article is to expand upon the extant
research that has focused on the function of religion among
individuals with cancer. Drawing on previous work in this
area, we develop and test several hypotheses using a large
sample of community-dwelling elderly people. We also go
beyond earlier research in two ways. First, we include a
number of measures that may influence the relationship be-
tween religion and cancer. Second, using a sample of Black
and White elderly persons, we examine the relationships
among religion, cancer, and mental health and how they
differ by race. Given the importance of religion among el-
derly Blacks (Chatters & Taylor, 1994), these differences
may prove substantial.
THEORETICAL OVERVIEW
Cancer as a Life Stress
Researchers have examined the links between religion
and cancer because of the stress that often accompanies a
cancer diagnosis. In a study of women with breast cancer,
Johnson and Spilka (1991) noted some problems associated
with cancer:
Perhaps nowhere is misery greater than when an individual
contracts cancer. Potential terminality immediately becomes
a salient issue, along with expectations of pain, anguish, and
suffering. Physical problems are compounded with a host
of psychological difficulties, not the least of which are feel-
ings of isolation, separation, dependency, and helplessness
(P- 21).
In these few sentences, the authors mention a number of
stressors for persons with cancer. First and foremost is the
possibility of death. An abundant body of literature has ex-
amined the stresses and coping mechanisms associated with
death and dying (e.g., Conrad, 1985; Koenig, 1988; Thorson
& Powell, 1990). Perhaps a worse stressor than approaching
death, however, is an uncertain prognosis following a can-
cer diagnosis. The uncertainty associated with cancer may
force patients to change or postpone their goals and expec-
tations for the future (Rowland, 1989). Moreover, because
the course of cancer can be unpredictable, normal methods
of active coping may prove maladaptive (Hilton, 1989).
Even in remission the cancer patient faces considerable un-
certainty and the attendant stress. As one author notes, "The
remission phase, then, is a process of adapting, not to a ter-
minal disease but to uncertainty" (Nathan, 1990, p. 225).
Johnson and Spilka (1991) also note fears associated
S218
CANCER, RELIGION, AND DEPRESSION S219
with pain and suffering. Not only do many cancer patients
suffer discomfort and pain from the disease itself, but they
may also suffer side effects from the cancer treatments. For
many, chemotherapy causes vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea,
alopecia, and other physical problems (Holland & Lesko,
1989). Radiation therapy may produce similar symptoms as
well as bring about significant changes in the appearance of
the patient (Holland, 1989).
Cancer patients also face significant stressors in their so-
cial lives. One problem is the potential inability to fulfill
normal role expectations in the workplace, in the commu-
nity, or at home. Parsons (1951) defined persons with an ill-
ness as being in the "sick role" and as such are exempt
from the expectations of normal role functioning. However,
this exemption does not necessarily mean that cancer pa-
tients will not despair over their inability to attend to daily
tasks or fulfill social obligations.
Cancer patients may also feel tension due to their need of
assistance from others. Cancer patients who need assistance
on a regular basis may begin to feel helpless or dependent.
These feelings may, in turn, affect their self-image and
bring about more feelings of despair. This problem is espe-
cially acute among elderly persons who need assistance
tending to household tasks, getting to the hospital for treat-
ment, or doing chores outside the home, such as shopping
for groceries. In short, cancer patients may suffer acute so-
cial stresses as a result of their disease.
Religion and Cancer Patients
Cancer patients may use a variety of mechanisms to cope
with and adapt to the disease. Few coping strategies, how-
ever, are as beneficial to the patient as religion. Religion
can benefit individuals with cancer by providing beliefs re-
lated to death and suffering as well as support from clergy
or fellow church members. Indeed, recent research suggests
that religion is an effective means of coping with cancer. In
the remainder of this section we will review some of this
research.
Private Religious Activities
Cohen and Lazarus (1983) argued that cognitive ap-
praisal of a situation is important for deciding what coping
strategies are best used in that situation. From their per-
spective, there exist two types of appraisals of a potentially
stressful situation. The first, primary appraisal, refers to a
judgment of whether the condition or event poses a signifi-
cant danger. Secondary appraisal refers to the process by
which an individual decides what resources are available to
cope with a problem.
Individuals can make three types of primary appraisals:
that the event will have no effect on them, that the effect
will be beneficial, or that the effect will be harmful. In
terms of making an appraisal, religion may provide individ-
uals with a framework through which they are less likely to
see their disease as harmful. Numerous stories in the Bible
testify to the importance of strong faith in times of adver-
sity and to the rewards that come to those who stand with
God in the worst of times. Further, because the Christian
faith places importance upon life after death, religious peo-
ple facing death may be more at ease under those circum-
stances. Rather than seeing death as an unknown, individu-
als with strong religious beliefs may instead look forward
to an afterlife that is better than their current situation.
Studies have shown that elderly persons who engage in de-
votional activities experience less fear of death. For exam-
ple, drawing on a sample of community-dwelling elderly,
Koenig (1988) found that those elders who reported more
frequent prayer activity during times of stress were more
likely to report little or no fear of death.
Religion may also benefit the cancer patient in terms of
the secondary appraisal. Religious people may see their ties
with God as a source of power and strength that is best used
in times of trouble. A number of authors have noted the ef-
ficacy of devotional activities or feeling close to God for in-
creased mental well-being (e.g., Ellison, 1991; Pollner,
1989). Many of these findings result from nationally repre-
sentative samples drawing on relatively healthy popula-
tions. For the individual with cancer, the beneficial effects
of private religiosity may be even greater. Jenkins and
Pargament (1988) showed that among cancer patients,
those who believed that God was in control of their situa-
tion had better self-esteem and less psychological distur-
bance. A number of other studies have shown that cancer
patients often rely upon private religious activities to cope
with their illness. For example, using a sample of hospital-
ized cancer patients, Sodestrom and Martinson (1987)
found that patients most frequently relied on prayer to cope
with their illness. Similarly, Halstead and Fernsler (1994)
reported that in a sample of long-term cancer survivors,
prayer was the most commonly cited coping strategy. Other
studies of women with breast cancer also have documented
the importance of prayer for coping with illness (Johnson &
Spilka, 1991; Mickley, Soeken, & Belcher, 1992).
Public Religious Activities
Individuals with cancer may also benefit from public re-
ligious activity, such as attending church services. Re-
searchers in religion and health often refer to the relation-
ship between public religious activities and health as the
social cohesiveness hypothesis (Idler, 1987). From this per-
spective, it is commonly thought that involvement in a reli-
gious community may be beneficial for a number of rea-
sons. First, as Berger (1967) argued, regular fellowship
with others of similar beliefs is important for maintaining
one's own beliefs. During stressful times when religious
faith may waiver, the spiritual support and fellowship pro-
vided by other congregants are especially important for the
maintenance of religious beliefs.
The ability to maintain religious faith is important in two
ways. First, as previously noted, religious beliefs can pro-
vide comfort and hope in the face of severe circumstances.
Second, another sort of religious belief, theodicy, may also
be important for persons with cancer. In essence, a religious
theodicy provides a framework through which individuals
can find meaning and understanding in suffering (Berger,
1967; Weber, 1946). By drawing on religious theodicies,
cancer patients can better come to terms with their disease
and, in so doing, find comfort.
The second way in which participation in church activi-
ties could be beneficial for those with cancer is that the
S220 MUSICKETAL
church provides an avenue through which patients can find
others to pray with and for them. Although Sodestrom and
Martinson (1987) cited prayer as the most common coping
strategy of their sample of cancer patients, the next two
most cited strategies were praying with others and having
others pray on their behalf. In their study of breast cancer
patients, Johnson and Spilka (1991) showed the importance
of interaction with the clergy and intercessory prayer for
the well-being of the women. They argued that the prayers
of others show concern and provide the women with a
greater sense of self-worth. Moreover, the prayers of others
may also reinforce the belief that God is in control of the
situation.
Third, interaction with a religious community may also
be an important avenue through which patients receive in-
strumental and emotional support. Researchers have shown
that social support is an important resource for helping peo-
ple cope with stressful situations (Cohen & Wills, 1985;
Lin & Ensel, 1989). Church members may visit patients in
the hospital or in their homes to provide companionship,
bring needed items, or help perform necessary chores. Sim-
ilarly, Ellison and George (1994) showed that persons ac-
tive in a religious group had higher levels of non-kin net-
work ties, received support, and quality of support. Bradley
(1995) found similar results using a nationally representa-
tive sample. In a recent article using data collected from a
sample of elderly persons, Idler and Kasl (1997) showed
that respondents who attend church regularly report having
more close friends and more contact with friends and kin.
The Importance of Religionfor African Americans
Researchers have documented the importance of splitting
samples according to race when analyzing the relationship
between religion and well-being (Ellison, 1995; Ferraro &
Koch, 1994; Musick, 1996; St. George & McNamara,
1984; Thomas & Holmes, 1992). As such, in these analy-
ses, we split the sample by race into groups of Blacks and
Whites. There are two reasons often cited for splitting sam-
ples according to race (see a review by Chatters & Taylor,
1994). First, several studies have attested that African
Americans report higher rates of public religious participa-
tion than do Whites (Roof & McKinney, 1987; Levin, Tay-
lor, & Chatters, 1994; Taylor, Chatters, Jayakody, & Levin,
1996) and are more likely to report that religion is impor-
tant to them (Moore, 1991; Taylor et al., 1996). For south-
ern Blacks, Ellison and Sherkat (1995) have termed the
church a "semi-involuntary institution" given such high
rates of participation in that segment of the population.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, researchers have
argued that the effect of religious activity on health should
be stronger for Blacks than for Whites. Several reasons are
posited to account for this relationship. First, because Blacks
face greater discrimination and barriers to institutions (e.g.,
health care) and status (e.g., high-paying employment) that
are beneficial for health and well-being, they must find alter-
nate avenues to success and well-being (Hummer, 1996;
Levin, 1984; Mirowsky & Ross, 1980). One such alternate
avenue for Black Americans is the church. A number of au-
thors have pointed to the importance of the church in the his-
tory of Black America; it has served as a source of commu-
nity empowerment (Lincoln & Mamiya, 1990; Moore, 1991)
and of help to those in the congregation and community
(Caldwell, Greene, & Billingsley, 1994; Chang, Williams,
Griffith, & Young, 1994; Eng & Hatch 1992; Taylor & Chat-
ters, 1986, 1988; Williams, Griffith, Young, Collins, & Dod-
son, in press), and as a facilitator of social and health inter-
ventions for parishioners (Levin, 1984, 1986; Williams et al.,
in press). In a study that compared Black and White church
congregations, Chaves and Higgins (1992) showed that
Black congregations are more active on civil rights issues
and in helping community members who face economic
hardship.
Another possible explanation for the stronger relation-
ship between religion and health for Blacks is the actual ac-
tivity that takes place within religious settings in Black
churches. Gilkes (1980) argued that several activities that
take place in those churches are unique and can be modified
to have therapeutic value. The practices she mentions are
speaking and singing about suffering, discussing problems
presented by persecutors, providing a safe place to "act
out," and giving validation to the experiences of fellow
congregants. Griffith, English, and May field (1980) pro-
vided evidence for the therapeutic value of Black churches
through their ethnographic study of Wednesday night
prayer meetings in a Black church. There is ample warrant
to believe that church and religious activities serve a spe-
cial place in the lives of African Americans. For that rea-
son, religious activity should have a greater effect for them
than for Whites.
Limitations of Earlier Research
Previous research on religious behavior among cancer
patients must be commended for its depth and ability to
elicit sensitive information from a very ill population.
However, the scope of these studies is also somewhat of a
weakness. That is, to obtain the information they did, most
of the researchers relied on small samples of patients in ad-
vanced stages of the disease (e.g., Yates, Chalmer, St.
James, Follansbee, & McKegney, 1981). Further, some of
the studies, (e.g., Johnson & Spilka, 1991; Mickley &
Soeken, 1993) relied only upon women for their research.
Although the studies have provided important insights into
the role of religion for those with cancer, the results are
hard to generalize at the community level. Further, because
the sample sizes have been small, previous researchers
were unable to make distinctions based on the importance
of religion in different social contexts. Using a large sample
of community-dwelling elderly adults, we reexamine the
relationship between religion and cancer on a broader scale,
incorporating the findings of previous research and drawing
on the previous theoretical discussion.
Hypotheses
In this article we address four primary questions. First,
do respondents diagnosed with cancer report more religious
activity than their counterparts without the disease? Sec-
ond, do respondents with cancer benefit in terms of depres-
sive symptomatology from their religious activity? Third,
are the effects of religious activity on depressive symp-
tomatology greater for the portion of the sample with can-
CANCER, RELIGION, AND DEPRESSION S221
cer compared to those without the disease? And finally,
given prior research and theory on race, religion, and well-
being, do the hypothesized relationships differ between
Blacks and Whites? Based on these questions we offer the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Both Blacks and Whites with cancer will
report more frequent religious activity
across time compared to those without the
disease.
Hypothesis 2: Among Blacks and Whites with cancer,
more frequent religious activity predicts
decreases in depressive symptomatology.
Hypothesis 3: The effect of religious activity on changes
in depressive symptomatology will be
greater for Blacks and Whites with cancer
than for those without the disease.
Hypothesis 4: The relationship between religious activ-
ity and depressive symptomatology will
be greater for Blacks than for Whites.
METHODS
Sample
Data for this study come from the Duke Established Pop-
ulations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE).
In addition to the North Carolina site, where these data
were collected, three other sites make up the research pro-
gram initiated by the National Institute on Aging: the Uni-
versity of Iowa, Yale University, and Harvard University.
For the North Carolina sample, the data were collected
from five contiguous counties in northern central North
Carolina, four rural and one urban. The entire sample size
is 4,162 persons; approximately half come from the urban
county and the other half are dispersed between the four
rural counties. Detailed explanations of the sample and
sampling procedure can be found elsewhere (Cornoni-
Huntley et al., 1990).
One of the primary missions of the Duke EPESE is the
examination of differences between Blacks and Whites in
health-related variables. Blacks were oversampled with the
intent that 55% of the survey population be Black. Sample
weights were then developed to adjust sample distributions
for probability of selection within households of varying
sizes, to adjust for differential nonresponse, and to match the
demographic characteristics of the five-county area, as esti-
mated by the U.S. Bureau of Census. These weights are es-
pecially important in that they redistributed responses ac-
cording to the racial distribution of the population, which is
36% Black and 64% non-Black. The fact that the weighted
data are based on a stratified oversample, however, renders
estimates for Blacks more precise than they would otherwise
be. Results presented in this article are based on weighted
data in order to permit population estimates. Sample and
subgroup sizes, however, are reported in unweighted form.
The 4,162 persons interviewed were drawn from a total
eligible sample of 5,223, yielding an 80% response rate.
The first and fourth waves of data were collected in 1986
and 1989 through personal interviews. Two telephone
waves of data were collected in 1987 and 1988; however,
we use data only from the first and fourth waves. The sam-
ple size in our analyses is 3,007, down from 4,162 due to
attrition by the fourth wave. We use weighted data to cor-
rect for the nonresponse bias occurring due to attrition.
Table 1 displays mean levels of the variables used in the
analyses, by race.
Measurement
Depressive symptomatology.--Depression was measured
using four subsets of the 20-item CES-D scale: somatic-
retarded activity (7 items, e.g., "I did not feel like eating;
my appetite was poor," "I could not get going"; a = .71),
depressed affect (5 items, e.g., "I felt depressed," "I felt
lonely"; a = .72), positive affect (3 items: "I felt hopeful
about the future," "I was happy," "I enjoyed life"; a = .53),
and interpersonal relations (2 items: "People were un-
friendly," "I felt that people disliked me"; a = .67). For
each item, respondents were asked whether they had felt
that way during the past week; each subscale was con-
structed by summing the number of affirmative responses.
We examined these four different dimensions of depression
because religious behavior may have differential effects de-
pending upon the facet of depression being studied. Earlier
research and our own factor analyses (not shown) showed
that the four dimensions of depression listed here are the
primary factors that make up the scale (Ensel, 1986;
Radloff, 1977). Higher scores for all the scales indicate
worse outcomes, but for positive affect higher scores indi-
cate better outcomes.
Cancer.--During each of the four waves, respondents
were asked whether they had been told by a doctor that

they had cancer. If respondents reported having cancer, or
were suspected of having cancer, they were then asked
what type of cancer they had. The types of cancer included
in the survey were lung, breast, colon, lymphoma, leuke-
mia, melanoma, other skin cancer, and all other cancers. If
respondents reported having cancer they were coded one
and all others were coded zero. We also coded respondents
who reported having skin cancer other than melanoma in
the zero category in order to prevent the inclusion of per-
sons with non-life-threatening illnesses. Because the num-
ber of respondents who had cancer only was low (73 in the
first wave), we chose to include in this group those respon-
dents who reported having cancer and another illness.
However, since we made comparisons with a "pure" other
illness group, any differences we observed should have
been due either to the cancer itself or some combination of
cancer and other illness. Regardless of which of these op-
tions is correct, the driving force behind the difference will
be cancer. There was also the possibility of contamination
in that respondents may have been diagnosed with cancer
or another illness between the first and second in-person
waves. To ensure the purity of the groups, we eliminated
from the analyses all those respondents who were diag-
nosed with cancer between these two waves (n = 92). This
made us certain that our comparisons were between respon-
dents diagnosed with cancer and all others without cancer.
Because we were not particularly interested in the other ill-
ness group, we did not eliminate those respondents who
contracted another illness between the waves. The sample
sizes for the three illness groups were cancer, 251; other ill-
ness, 1,770; and no illness, 894.
Other illness.--To test whether the relationship between
cancer, religion, and mental health is actually a function of
having cancer as opposed to some other chronic illness, we
included in our analyses an indicator of other illnesses. For
this measure, if respondents reported having high blood
pressure, diabetes, a heart attack, or stroke, but did not re-
port having cancer, they were coded one and others were
coded zero. Further, a no illness group was created for
which those with no illness were coded one and others zero.
Functional impairment.--In order to determine whether
the relationship between religion and cancer might be due to
physical functioning, we included a measure of impairment
in our analyses: the total Rosow-Breslau (1966) scale of ac-
tivity limitation. The scale consists of three items that mea-
sure whether the respondent can (a) do heavy work, (b)
walk up a flight of stairs, and (c) walk a half mile. Variables
were coded zero if respondents could do the activity and one
if they could not; higher scores indicate greater impairment.
Service attendance.--Respondents were asked, "About
how often do you go to religious meetings or services?" The
six response categories were (a) never/almost never, (b) once
or twice a year, (c) every few months, (d) once or twice a
month, (e) once a week, and (f) more than once a week.
Religious media.--Respondents were asked, "About how
often do you watch religious services or religious programs
on T.V. or listen to them on the radio?" This item used the
same response categories as service attendance.
Religious devotion.--Respondents were asked, "How
often do you spend time in private religious activities, such
as prayer, meditation, or Bible study?" The five response
categories used were (a) rarely or never, (b) a few times a
month, (c) once a week, (d) two or more times a week, and
(e) daily.
Social interaction.--Because some of the benefits re-
ceived from church attendance are due to social resources,
we included social relationship measures. The first such
scale consisted of five items measuring amounts of social
interaction. The five items were number of (a) children, (b)
other relatives, and (c) friends respondents see during a
month; (d) how often respondents talked on the phone in
the past week; and (e) whether respondents were members
of a church, club, or other organization. For the first three
items, scores ranged from zero to ten or more and for the
phone item scores ranged from zero to seven or more. The
scale was created by summing the number scores for each
variable.
Social interaction satisfaction (a = .43; r = .31).--This
two-item scale measures respondents' satisfaction with the
amount of time they see friends and relatives. Responses
include wanting to see others more often, the same amount,
or less often; higher scores indicate greater satisfaction. The
measures of social interaction and social interaction satis-
faction were taken from the Duke Social Support Inventory
(Landerman, 1994) and have been used in previous studies
of religion and well-being (e.g., Musick, 1996).
Sociodemographics.--We controlled for several back-
ground characteristics: sex (0 = male, 1 = female), age (in
years), education (years of schooling), and marital status (0
= not married, 1 = married).
Analytical Strategy
Because we had two waves of data, we used conditional
change analysis (Finkel, 1995). That is, the dependent vari-
able in the models was the Wave 2 measure of the outcome,
whereas the independent variables, including the baseline
measure of the dependent variable, were measured in Wave
1. Regression coefficients indicated a change in the out-
come across waves. Using this method helps to disentangle
difficulties with causal ordering.
We employed two types of regression analysis given the
nature of the outcome variables. Because the religious activ-
ity items were measured using an ordinal scale, we used
polytomous logistic regression, also called ordered logit
modeling, to estimate effects. However, the depressive symp-
tomatology outcomes were measured using an interval scale,
and as such, we were able to use ordinary least squares re-
gression to estimate those effects.
To make comparisons between the cancer and noncancer
subsamples, we computed these analyses for two compari-
son groups, those with a noncancer chronic illness and
those reporting no chronic illness. Using these coefficients,
CANCER, RELIGION, AND DEPRESSION S223
we performed a two-tailed t test (Clogg & Eliason, 1986) to
determine whether there were significant differences in the
effects of religious activity across the illness groups. A two-
tailed t test was also used to determine whether there were
differences in effects between the two racial subsamples.
RESULTS
Analysis of Religious Activity
Table 2 displays the results of the analysis concerning
cancer and religious activity. Because the omitted category
in these models is having cancer, a positive coefficient indi-
cates that respondents in the cancer group engage in less re-
ligious activity than the relevant comparison group. Note
also that these estimates are adjusted for sex, age, education,
marital status, and functional ability. For the Wave 1 reli-
gious activity outcomes, there is no difference in levels of
religious activity between the cancer and noncancer groups
for either race. However, estimates for the second in-person
wave outcomes are somewhat different. Among Blacks, re-
spondents with cancer are more likely to report an increase
in religious devotion than both the other illness and no ill-
ness groups; however, this difference is only significant for
the other illness group. In terms of religious media, Blacks
with cancer are also more likely to report an increase in ac-
tivity. In contrast, Blacks with cancer are less likely to report
increases in service attendance compared to the other illness
or no illness groups. This overall pattern for the White sub-
sample is similar; however, significant differences between
illness groups occur only for changes in religious media.
Comparing effects between races, we find significant dif-
ferences. First, Blacks and Whites differ in the effect of
cancer versus other illness on religious devotion in the
panel analyses (t = 2.79, p < .01). Second, in the panel anal-
yses on service attendance, the effect of cancer versus other
illness and no illness differs between Blacks and Whites
(other illness: / = 3.33, p < .001; no illness: t = 3.89, p <
.001). In all three situations, the results support our expec-
tations. The relationship between religious activity and can-
cer is stronger for Blacks than for Whites.
Table 3 shows the results of the analyses linking reli-
gious activity to depressive symptomatology among re-
spondents with cancer. For each group of depressive symp-
toms the table lists two columns. The first shows the
coefficient for the correlation between that religious activity
and the second wave symptom group, and the second dis-
plays the religious activity regression coefficients for two
regression models. The first model includes all of the reli-
gious activity measures as well as the first wave outcome.
The second model includes the aforementioned variables
plus other controls, thereby providing the most rigorous test
of the hypothesis.
In the Black subsample, only service attendance has ben-
eficial effects on depressive symptomatology such that re-
spondents who attend more often report fewer somatic-
retarded symptoms, less depressed affect, and more positive
affect. However, service attendance is significantly related
to symptomatology outcomes in the most rigorous test (full
multivariate regression model) only for positive affect.
In contrast to Blacks, Whites show no pattern of associa-
tion between religious activity and depressive symptoma-
tology. To determine whether the observed difference in ef-
fects for service attendance between Whites and Blacks is
significant, we performed a t test on the differences in coef-
ficients. The results of these calculations indicate that only
the service attendance coefficients for positive affect are
significantly different (t = 2.30; p < .05).
The final part of our analysis focuses on whether the ef-
fects we find for religious activity among respondents with
cancer are unique to that group. Due to the small number of
significant findings in this portion of the analysis, we did
not display these results in tabular form; they are, however,
available in that form upon request from the authors. The
analyses show that in the African American subsample, the

effect of service attendance on positive affect for those with
cancer is significantly different from the effects of service
attendance on that outcome in both of the other illness
groups (other illness b = -.002, difference t = 3.242; no ill-
ness b = .020, difference t = 2.727). There are also several
significant effects for religious activity in the no illness and
other illness groups for other outcomes. However, none of
these effects are significantly different from the correspond-
ing effects in the other groups.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this article is to improve upon the extant
literature on religion and cancer. In so doing, we have at-
tempted to answer four questions concerning this relation-
ship. This section is devoted to discussing each of these
questions in the context of our findings. We conclude the
section by discussing some implications for future research.
First, did respondents with cancer report higher levels of
religious activity than respondents without cancer? Al-
though we found no significant differences in the cross-
sectional analyses, we found that the cancer and noncancer
groups differ in levels of change in religious activity across
the waves. In most cases, having cancer predicts greater re-
ligious activity over time compared to having another or no
illness. Among Blacks, we found that having cancer pre-
dicts less service attendance over time compared to the
other illness groups.
The second question we examined was whether religious
activity decreased depressive symptomatology among re-
spondents with cancer. We found such an effect only for
service attendance among Blacks; more frequent service at-
tendance is related to higher levels of positive affect. Ser-
vice attendance is also related to lower levels of depressed
affect among Blacks, but this result is not significant in the
final model.
Earlier research on religion and cancer has tended to fo-
cus on the importance of private religious activity. This
focus was sometimes a necessity given that samples were
institutionalized and could not easily participate in public
religious activities. However, their findings coincide with
ours because they found that visits by clergy and interces-
sory prayer (e.g., Johnson & Spilka, 1991) were important
to maintaining hope and optimism. As we mentioned previ-
ously, one possible mechanism underlying our findings and
those of others has been referred to as "social cohesive-
ness" (Idler, 1987). According to this perspective, religion
best helps individuals by providing access to others who
may provide support, both instrumental and emotional, in
times of need. For terminally ill patients, such support
would necessarily come through visits by clergy and other
parishioners. However, for persons with cancer in the com-
munity, such interaction may be more dependent upon indi-
viduals' active participation in the religious group.
We also addressed the question of whether the relation-
ship between religion and depression is unique to the can-
cer group. Because earlier researchers relied on samples of
CANCER, RELIGION, AND DEPRESSION S225
cancer patients, they were unable to determine whether the
effects they observed were limited to those patients or
whether they were true of others as well. Interestingly, we
found that the positive effects of service attendance among
Blacks is unique to the cancer group. Moreover, the analy-
ses showed that having another chronic illness does not
tend to moderate the effect of religious activity on depres-
sive symptomatology. Cancer may be associated with a
unique set of circumstances, in terms of uncontrollability,
stress, discomfort, and uncertainty, such that public reli-
gious activity will have its greatest effects for those with
the disease.
Finally, the fact that the effect of service attendance is
stronger among Blacks should not be surprising given ear-
lier research on religion and life satisfaction that showed
similar trends (St. George & McNamara, 1984; Thomas &
Holmes, 1992). Other studies that focused solely on African
Americans have shown similarly strong results for that
group (Levin, Chatters, & Taylor, 1995). The "support
bank" concept (Antonucci, 1985) may be partially responsi-
ble for our finding that the effects of service attendance on
positive affect are strongest among Blacks. That is, the
strong historical and contemporary presence of the Black
church may instill in parishioners the idea that if they do
the work of the church while able (e.g., attend services,
visit and help those in need), the church will respond when
they are in need. Taylor and Chatters (1988) found that the
church is an important source of informal support for many
African Americans. For elderly southern Blacks, the church
may be one of few resources mat they can expect help from
when their need is greatest. For those cancer patients facing
considerable uncertainty regarding the disease, such an ex-
pectation may be very beneficial.
Limitations
Given the previous evidence on the ties between mental
well-being and religion, it is interesting that we do not find
stronger effects in this study. This lack of findings may be
due to the limitations of our data. First, as we have indi-
cated, earlier studies of this sort focused on very ill popula-
tions. In many cases the sample consisted of terminal can-
cer patients, and as such, the investigators were certain
about what stage of the disease they were covering. In con-
trast, our measures of cancer do not distinguish those who
are terminal from those who are in remission or currently in
therapy. Therefore, to some degree, our cancer group may
be too heterogeneous to find all the anticipated effects.
Second, a lack of religious heterogeneity in our sample
may affect the expected relationships. As we have noted,
our data were drawn from a sample of elderly adults living
in the southeastern portion of the United States. That region
of the country is largely Protestant and has high overall lev-
els of religious activity (Roof & McKinney, 1987), espe-
cially among Blacks (Ellison & Sherkat, 1995). This lack
of variation in the measures of religious activity might have
attenuated our findings.
Implications
Given our findings and the limitations of our data, what
are the possible avenues for future research? First, future
research should address religious activity, cancer, and men-
tal health using a different, more religiously heterogeneous
sample. The sample should be community-based and longi-
tudinal in nature to improve upon our knowledge of these
processes as they occur outside of institutional settings.
Such research should also be attuned to the fine-grained na-
ture of religious activity; that is, measures of public and
private religious activity should be much more specific. For
instance, if future studies wished to explore the possibility
of a support bank located in the church, then measures
should include whether the respondent visits others in need
or volunteers for church group activities. In contrast, if the
researcher expects that public religious activity will be im-
portant because members in need receive support from
other congregants, then help received specifically from
church members should be measured.
Moreover, future measures of religion should also try to
tap thefunction of religious activity for individuals. That is,
not only should researchers try to measure what people do
with regard to religion, but also what purpose that serves in
their lives. In their work on social support in the church,
Taylor and Chatters (1986) have indicated what types of
support are received from church members. Other studies
(e.g., Griffith et al., 1980; Levin, 1986) have examined the
specific role of the pastor and church group in the mainte-
nance of individual well-being. We have noted also that re-
ligion can provide hope or freedom from death anxiety for
those with severe illness (Koenig, 1994). Future studies
should determine whether indeed the hope, optimism, or
freedom from worry that is provided by religious teachings
or fellowship with other church members mediate any asso-
ciations we find between religion and well-being.
Third, future research should begin to take into account
the moderating effect of stress and other social factors on
the relationship between religion and mental health. If can-
cer can be perceived of as a stress (net of its physical ef-
fects), then we have shown that a significant stressor can
substantially moderate the effect of religious activity on de-
pressive symptomatology. Indeed, if religion's true effect is
to provide comfort, either in terms of support or beliefs,
then we should expect that religion will be most powerful
for those in stressful circumstances (Glock, Ringer, and
Babbie, 1967). Several authors have provided evidence to
support this conclusion (Idler, 1995; Idler & Kasl, 1992;
Maton, 1989; Musick, 1996; Williams et al., 1991). Further,
by splitting the sample by race and finding significant ef-
fects mostly for Blacks, we have underscored the impor-
tance of in the relationship between religion and health.
Other social contexts, like socioeconomic status and gen-
der, could affect this relationship in similar ways and
should be addressed in future research.
