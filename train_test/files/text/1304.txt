The dietary guidelines developed for adults have been extended to children, but the role of serum cholesterol in
the neurodevelopment of children is poorly understood. In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1988­1994), serum total cholesterol was measured in 4,852 children aged 6­16 years. Psychosocial
development was evaluated by interviewing the mother regarding the child's history of school suspension or
expulsion and difficulty in getting along with others. After adjustment for family socioeconomic status, maternal
marital status and education, children's nutrition, and academic performance, the odds ratios of children with
various concentrations of total cholesterol showed the children to be equally comfortable in their own peer
subculture and not to be different in the proportion that had seen a mental health professional. However, non-
African-American children with a serum total cholesterol concentration below the 25th percentile (<145 mg/dl)
were almost threefold more likely to have been suspended or expelled from schools than their peers with total
cholesterol at or above the 25th percentile (odds ratio ¼ 2.96, 95% confidence interval: 1.55, 5.64). The authors
concluded that, among non-African-American children, low total cholesterol is associated with school suspension
or expulsion and that low total cholesterol may be a risk factor for aggression or a risk marker for other biologic
variables that predispose to aggression.

Evidence from several large epidemiology and postmor-
tem studies (1) reveals that serum cholesterol predicts
coronary disease incidence and mortality. Therefore, a num-
ber of professional organizations endorsed recommendations
restricting dietary intake of fat and cholesterol for children
aged 2 years and up in order to keep cholesterol levels low
from an early age and to prevent the development of
arteriosclerosis in adulthood (2). However, the role of serum
cholesterol in the neurodevelopment of children is uncertain,
and associations between low serum cholesterol levels and
negative mood, decrements in cognitive function, and
various types of aggressive behavior have been noted in
adults and nonhuman primates (3­8). Cholesterol is now
thought to be required for synaptic growth (9), and genetic
disorders of cholesterol synthesis are associated with mental
retardation and suicidality (10, 11). Such issues and concerns
have tended (12­15) to hamper implementation of the fat
recommendations to children in the general population.

Intervention Project (STRIP) (17, 18), and others (19, 20)
have suggested that a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet
decreases the concentration of serum low density lipopro-
tein cholesterol in children without detrimental effects on
growth and psychosocial health. However, certain limita-
tions in these studies constrain the validity of these
conclusions as well as their generalizability to a broader
population. All study subjects in STRIP were younger than
5 years of age; minor neurodevelopment deficits are difficult
to recognize during the first few years of life. The subjects in
DISC were children with hyperlipemia (low density lipo-
protein cholesterol levels greater than the 80th percentile of
children in the general population). Both STRIP and DISC
were conducted in select volunteer samples under intensive
surveillance and lowered serum cholesterol by no more than
5 percent compared with control subjects (21). Population-
wide longitudinal studies about the effects of blood
cholesterol on neurodevelopment in children would be
highly informative, but such data are unlikely to be available
in the near future because of prohibitive logistics and cost
(22). Therefore, we examined the associations between
serum cholesterol concentrations and psychosocial devel-
opment of noninstitutionalized school-age children and
adolescents using data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The NHANES III is a cross-sectional survey of the US
civilian noninstitutionalized population living in house-
holds, conducted from 1988 to 1994. The sampling scheme
was a stratified, multistage probability design with over-
sampling of African Americans and Mexican Americans to
allow more precise estimates for these subpopulations.
Detailed descriptions of the survey have been published
elsewhere (23). The NHANES III included medical and
cognitive examinations and interviews conducted with
survey children and proxy respondents. The sample for
Household Youth Questionnaires and Youth and Proxy
Questionnaires consists of 7,961 children aged 6­16 years.
Of these children, 1,540 were excluded since validated
hematologic data were not available. Proxy reports from
someone other than the child's mother may not be as valid
as, or comparable with, a mother's report; therefore, an
additional 791 children were further excluded because the
proxy respondents were not their mothers. Because the
behavioral problems and school experience of mentally or
physically handicapped children are likely different from
those of other children, we excluded 757 children who
attended special schools or classes as a result of impairment
(including learning disabilities) or health problems, such as
cerebral palsy, epilepsy/fit/convulsion, mental retardation,
or muscle weakness (n ¼ 185), or who had trouble seeing
with one or both eyes even when wearing glasses or con-
tact lenses or had trouble hearing with one or both ears
(n ¼ 572). We analyzed the data from the remaining 4,852
children and adolescents.
Measurements and variable definitions
Serum cholesterol. Total cholesterol was measured en-
zymatically (measurement of triglycerides and the calcula-
tion of low density lipoprotein cholesterol require use of
fasting samples, whereas less than half of the children were
fasting at the time of phlebotomy). Initial exploratory
analyses indicated that a linear or U- or J-shaped association
did not exist and that using a single cutoff to dichotomize
the total cholesterol concentration was able to present the
association sufficiently. We examined various cutoffs of the
total cholesterol concentration and observed that the 25th
percentile (145 mg/dl) of the total cholesterol distribution
among the weighted study population was the optimal one.
Psychosocial development. During the Youth and Proxy
Questionnaires interview, mothers were asked a series of
questions about their children's behaviors and social skills.
Psychosocial development was measured by four dichoto-
mous variables constructed from the mothers' answers to
these questions: 1) whether the child had ever seen
a psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychoanalyst about any
emotional, mental, or behavioral problems (affirmed
answer: n ¼ 296); 2) whether the child had ever been
suspended, excluded, or expelled from school (n ¼ 341); 3)
whether the child was somewhat shy and slow to make
a new friend (n ¼ 949); and 4) whether the child had
difficulties in getting along with others (n ¼ 907).
Major covariates. The covariates were selected from the
literature (24­30) and included the following: the child's
ethnicity as reported by the mother, maternal education
(high school or below vs. above high school), number of
times the family had moved (three or more vs. less than
three), crowded dwelling (more than one person per room),
and rural/urban classification of residence area (central or
fringe counties of metropolitan areas of 1 million population
or more vs. other counties). Since there were only 171 non-
White, non-African-American children and since the
majority of the characteristics examined were similar
between these children and the White children, we collapsed
these 171 children with the White children into one group
(non-African-American children). Maternal marital status
was collapsed into two categories: single-parent household
(included mothers who were married but their spouses were
not living in the household, widowed, divorced, separated,
or never married) and married mothers with their spouses
living in the household. Total family income for the previous
12 months was reported for categories ranging from less
than $1,000 to $80,000 and over, in $1,000 increments at or
below $19,999 and in $5,000 increments between $20,000
and $79,999. A poverty index ratio was then calculated by
comparing the midpoint for the category and the child's
family sizewith the federal poverty line (poverty index ratio ¼
1). These analyses used a three-level variable of poverty
status: low income (poverty index ratio < 1.30, the federal
cutpoint for eligibility for the Food Stamp Program); middle
income (poverty index ratio ¼ 1.30­2.99); and high
income (poverty index ratio  3.0) (25). A child was
classified as food insufficient if the mother reported that the
family either sometimes or often did not get enough food
to eat.

Mothers rated their children's health as excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor. A dichotomous variable was used in
the analyses, comparing children in fair or poor health with
children with excellent, very good, or good health. During
Household Family and Household Youth Questionnaires
interviews, the children were asked a series of questions
about their own substance abuse behaviors. Children were
classified as substance abusers (n ¼ 220) if they answered
affirmatively to at least one of these questions: 1) Have you
ever used marijuana? (n ¼ 139); 2) have you ever used crack
or cocaine in any form? (n ¼ 11); 3) have you smoked at least
100 cigarettes during your entire life? (n ¼ 66); 4) in the past
12 months did you have at least 12 drinks of any kind of
alcoholic beverage? (n ¼ 141). We used standing height (in
meters) measured at the time of the examination as an
indicator of past nutrition status and z scores of age-adjusted
body mass index as a surrogate variable of body image. Daily
dietary energy intake was obtained from a 24-hour dietary
recall performed by mothers. Other nutrition covariates were
serum albumin and total proteins. Data on these two variables
were available for children older than 11 years only and were
used in the secondary analysis.
The Arithmetic and Reading subtests of the Wide Range
Achievement Test, Revised (WRAT-R), and the Block
Design and Digit Span subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children, Revised, were administered to all
subjects (23). The WRAT-R Arithmetic Subtest consists of
oral and written problems ranging from simple addition to
calculus, while the Reading Subtest assesses letter recogni-
tion and word reading skills. In the Block Design Subtest, the
child replicates two-dimensional geometric patterns using
a set of three-dimensional cubes; this subtest is a measure of
nonverbal reasoning. The Digit Span Subtest assesses short-
term and working memory by asking the child to repeat
a series of increasingly long number sequences forward and
then backward. The WRAT-R Arithmetic and Reading test
scores were age standardized to a mean of 100 (standard
deviation: 15), while the Block Design and Digit Span test
scores of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children,
Revised, were age standardized to a mean of 10 (standard
deviation: 3).
Statistical methods
As recommended by the National Center for Health
Statistics, we used SUDAAN software (31) (SAS version
7.5; SAS Institute, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina) with appropriate weighting and nesting variables.
We used logistic regression to estimate multivariable-
adjusted odds ratios of a negative psychosocial indicator
and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals. Before
multivariable modeling, we examined the age-adjusted as-
sociation between each psychosocial indicator and each
covariate. For illustration purposes only, all continuous
variables were categorized using quartiles or clinically rec-
ommended cutoffs, if available. A multivariable model was
generated in a stepwise fashion for each psychosocial
indicator. In the first step, the main effect and covariates,
for which the overall p values of age-adjusted odds ratios
were less than 0.25, were entered into the model. In the
second step, the covariates with a p value greater than 0.10
were dropped, and the interactions among main effect and
gender, urbanization of residence area, and ethnicity were
tested. We kept the covariates with p values of regression
coefficients less than 0.05 (two sided) in multivariable
models. However, to avoid overadjusting and to increase
the precision of estimates, we removed any covariate whose
addition to the multivariable model changed the odds ratio
of interest by less than 10 percent. Because preliminary
analysis indicated that a strong interaction ( p < 0.01) existed
between serum total cholesterol and race for the history of
school suspension, we present the results of multivariable-
adjusted logistic regression for the entire sample as well as
by race. At the final stage of the analysis, we conducted
secondary regression analyses including the following: 1)
daily energy intakes (with or without log transformation) in
children 8­16 years of age and 2) serum albumin and total
protein measurements in children 12­16 years of age to
examine whether inclusion of these variables altered the
findings. Regressions on all subjects who had valid data on
serum cholesterol were also performed to examine potential
biases caused by exclusion of a large portion of the subjects
due to learning disability or other health problems.
RESULTS
Among the 4,852 children included in the analyses, the
weighted average age was 10.0 (standard error: 0.1) years,
51.3 (standard error: 1.4) percent were boys (table 1), and
15.5 (standard error: 1.3) percent were African Americans.
Of these children, 22.7 (standard error: 1.3) percent were
living with single mothers, 5.7 (standard error: 0.6) percent
did not have enough food to eat sometimes, and 8.4
(standard error: 0.9) percent had ever been suspended from
school. Children excluded from analyses differed from those
included in several respects. Compared with the participants
included, those excluded were less healthy and more likely
to live below the federal poverty line. As expected, the
children and adolescents excluded were more likely to have
seen a mental health professional for emotional or behav-
ioral problems, and they were more likely to have been
suspended or expelled from school.
Of the four psychosocial indicators, a history of school
suspension or expulsion was associated with most of the
covariates analyzed (table 2), including low socioeconomic
status, being male, being African American, reporting
substance abuse, having poor health, and living with a single
mother. Having seen a psychiatrist or psychologist was
associated with male gender, food insufficiency, and mater-
nal marital status (single). Feeling shy or being slow to
make friends was significantly associated with living with
a single mother, low maternal education, and being African
American. Substance abuse was associated with increased
odds of a history of school suspension and having seen
a psychologist or psychiatrist but with reduced odds of
feeling shy or being slow to make new friends.
After adjustment for age and gender (table 3), children
having low serum cholesterol levels did not differ from other
children in whether or not they had ever seen a psychologist

or psychiatrist, in their mother-rated social skills with peers,
and in their level of comfort in their own peer subculture.
However, children with low serum total cholesterol levels
were more likely than other children to have been suspended
or expelled from school. When subjects were separated by
race, this association held specifically for non-African-
American children. For the children with high total
cholesterol levels, the suspension prevalence among non-
African Americans was much lower than that of African
Americans. Among children with low total cholesterol
levels, suspension prevalence did not differ by race (table 3).
These analyses were repeated with adjustment of addi-
tional psychosocial covariates (table 4). No new findings
emerged, and the association between a low serum choles-
terol level and a history of school suspension or expulsion
tended to strengthen. Among non-African Americans,
a history of school suspension or expulsion was approxi-
mately threefold higher for children with total cholesterol
below the 25th percentile than for children with total
cholesterol at or above the 25th percentile. All the estimates
for children aged 6­16 years remained essentially the same
when including daily energy intakes (with or without log
transformation) from children aged 8­16 years, serum total
protein, and albumin from children aged 12­16 years as
additional variables in supplementary analyses (data not
shown). Estimates from the regression on all subjects who

DISCUSSION
From a large national sample of children and adolescents,
we observed that, of four psychosocial development indica-
tors, a history of school suspension was significantly associ-
ated with low serum total cholesterol and that this association
existed among non-African-American children only. These
results are important because they are the first to demonstrate
a statistically significant, ethnicity-dependent association
between serum total cholesterol and aggressive behaviors
from a national sample of noninstitutionalized, school-age
children. This association persists even after adjustment for
many other factors, including cognitive and academic perfor-
mance and nutrition status, which are known to place child-
ren's emotional and behavioral development at risk.
The behaviors that lead to school suspension have been
seen as ``red flags'' to identify students with serious
behavioral problems. Prior studies reveal that over two thirds
of school suspensions and expulsions are ordered in response
to acts of physical aggression (27, 30). Therefore, the results
of the current study are consistent with the majority of
previous studies examining the associations between low
serum cholesterol and various forms of aggression in adults.
With few exceptions (32), significant associations have been
observed from cross-sectional studies (7, 33), cohort samples
(5), general population studies (5), psychiatric patients and
criminals (13­15), and controlled dietary studies conducted
in nonhuman primates (34). In particular, low total choles-
terol has been associated with the onset of conduct disorder
during childhood among male criminals (7). The current
study extends prior literature by showing an ethnicity-
dependent association among children and adolescents. Re-
search across the age spectrum and including other ethnic-
ities might be helpful in disentangling the mystery of the
association between serum cholesterol and violence. As of
today, almost all studies examining the association between
serum cholesterol levels and violencewere carriedout among
Caucasian adults. Researchers have speculated that the
observed association of low cholesterol with violence may
be a product of confounding. However, it is unlikely that
confounding effects from occult factors would selectively
affect non-African-American children only.
From prior literature on adults, it is unclear whether there
is a temporal association between serum cholesterol and
violent behavior. By showing a statistically significant
association from children and adolescents, the current study
provides indirect evidence that a low serum cholesterol level
precedes aggressive behaviors. This study used school
suspension as a marker of early aggression. Early aggression
has been identified as one of the strongest predictors of later
aggression and criminal involvement (35, 36). Children who

exhibited aggressive behavior at age 8 years were more likely
to report higher levels of physical aggression, to have more
criminal convictions as adults, and to engage in more serious
criminal acts (28). Almost half of those who initiated violent
behavior between 10 and 12 years of age eventually became
chronic violent offenders (37). However, temporality is just
one of Hill's criteria for a causal connection as described by
Golomb (4), and a putative cause-effect relation between low
serum cholesterol and violence awaits further study. Low
total cholesterol may represent a biologic marker rather than
a risk factor for childhood-onset conduct disorder and violent
behavior. Cholesterol and aggressive behavior may not be
causally related to one another.
It is possible that at least part of the association of low
total cholesterol with school suspension is explainable by
a reverse causation. School suspension appears to have
serious negative psychiatric consequences, including ele-
vated depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disor-
der (38). Post-traumatic stress disorder may result in a fall in
cholesterol concentration, and depressed cholesterol may
persist for years in chronic medical conditions (39). Low or
lowered cholesterol has been linked to other biologic factors
that predispose to nonatherosclerotic diseases (40). Low
total cholesterol or lipoprotein concentrations may result in
impaired delivery of lipids and fat-soluble nutrients to cells
that are activated during the immune response and involved
in tissue repair, thus possibly impairing defense against
endotoxins and viruses (41­43). In any case, both psycho-
logical and biologic consequences (38) of school suspension
or expulsion on children and adolescents deserve further
examination.
Many biologic mechanisms have been postulated to
explain the association between serum lipids and violence.
Cholesterol and fats have many physiologic roles and may
influence brain function and behavior through modification
of membranes and through effects on production, reuptake,
or metabolism of neurotransmitters. Several studies in
nonhuman primates and humans suggest a specific connec-
tion between low or lowered fats or cholesterol levels and
low or lowered serotonin activity (44, 45). In humans, the
association between decreased serotonin and impulsivity
and aggression is well documented (45, 46). Researchers

* Serum total cholesterol of 145 mg/dl (e.g., at or above the 25th percentile of the weighted population) was used as the referent level. The
medians were 168.73 (standard error: 0.83) mg/dl and 132.46 (standard error: 1.06) mg/dl, respectively, for the high and low levels of serum total
cholesterol.
y The percentage of African-American children among the unweighted study sample was 34.7% (1,685/4,852); however, the percentage
among the weighted study population was 15.5% (table 1). This discrepancy was due to an oversampling of African Americans required by the
complex multistage sample design used in the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey.

therefore speculated that low cholesterol might increase
impulsivity by lowering serotonin activity (47). Most
children and adolescents suspended from school indeed
attributed their infractions to a lack of self-control, rather
than blaming others (30). This study, however, is unable to
clarify whether the association of total cholesterol and
aggression is a reflection of genetic covariance or a direct
causal association. Though a difference in the association
by race/ethnicity was found in the current study, we are
not able to rule out the possibility that this difference was
due to basal prevalence. The prevalence of school suspen-
sion is already high among African-American children, so
the marginal impact from lower total cholesterol, if any,
would be relatively small compared with that on non-
African-American children, among whom the basal preva-
lence of school suspension is low.
The results of the current study should be viewed with
caution. As in all research using self-report measures, the
psychosocial indicators used in the current study represented
the perceptions of therespondents or proxies (30).The survey
format is subject to multiple biases, including social de-
sirability. In addition, because the responses to the survey
items were collapsed or originally designed as dichotomized
variables, the range of possible responses was restricted,
possibly resulting in misclassifications. For example, school
suspension or expulsion is a highly contextualized decision,
and the severity of rule violations leading to a school
suspension varies case by case (29). The heterogeneity of
measurement may lead to measurement errors, resulting
in an attenuation of the true relations. Depressive symptoms
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are two major
reasons for children and adolescents to see psychiatrists or
psychologists (48, 49). Because depressive symptoms and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder differ etiologically,
grouping children with depressive symptoms, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or other developmental-
behavioral problems together might account for the failure
to identify an association between serum cholesterol and a
history of seeing psychiatrists or psychologists.
This study has several other limitations. First, the findings
were based on a cross-sectional survey. The duration of
exposure to abnormal levels of serum cholesterol is un-
known. Second, although the richness of NHANES III allows
us to delineate the relation between serum cholesterol and
psychosocial development after adjustment for many factors,
we were unable to adjust for other important potential
confounders, such as duration of poverty, maternal mental
health, serum essential fatty acids, or long chain poly-
unsaturated fatty acids, which have been demonstrated to
be associated with behavioral development (50). However, it
was unlikely that these unmeasured factors selectively
confounded the association for non-African-American chil-
dren only. Finally, the samples of the current study may
represent only minor offenders. Institutionalized children
and children in special classes were excluded. Therefore, the
ability to identify a strong association between total choles-
terol and aggression may have been constrained by not
sampling those who may have been institutionalized in the
juvenile justice system because of serious violent offending.
The current study has several unique strengths as well.
Existing data suggest that social skills are associated with
micro- and macronutrients in animal or human adults (51).
Many of these associations, however, are difficult to assess
in infants or toddlers with the degree of reliability and
precision that is possible in older children (52). Thus, if any,
the relation of serum cholesterols and neurobehaviors in
school-age children may be more cogent. Children of the
NHANES III were randomly selected from the noninstitu-
tionalized US population; therefore, our results should be
fairly generalizable to children in the United States.
In summary, this study reports a statistically significant
association between school suspension or expulsion and low
total cholesterol among non-African-American children and
adolescents from a multiethnic national sample. The finding
corroborates and extends the existing literature linking low
total cholesterol and aggressive behaviors in adults. Low
cholesterol may be a risk factor for aggressive behavior,
a risk marker for other biologic substances or genotypes that
