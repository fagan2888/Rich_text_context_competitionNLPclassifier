Abstract
Objective: To explore mean food group intakes associated with central obesity
anthropometry among children and adolescents enrolled in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Setting: Representative sampling of the US population (1998­2002).
Subjects: Subjects were 3761 children (5­11 years) and 1803 adolescents (12­16
years) with single 24 h dietary recalls and anthropometric measures of central
body fat (waist circumference and sum of subscapular and suprailiac skinfold
thicknesses).
Results: Results were controlled for confounding by age, height, race/ethnicity,
Tanner stage, television viewing and parental education. In younger children,
there was no relationship between central adiposity and mean intakes of dairy,
fruit, vegetables or grains, while a positive association with meat intake was
found among boys. In adolescent boys and girls, central body fat measures were
inversely associated with mean dairy and grain intakes. Adolescent boys in the
highest quartile of central adiposity consumed less fruit and fewer vegetables;
those in the lowest central adiposity quartile consumed less meat. Finally, ado-
lescents who met the criteria for central obesity (waist circumference $85th
percentile for age and sex) reported consuming significantly less total dairy (as
well as milk and cheese separately), total grains (whole and refined) and total
fruit and vegetables. There was no association with meat consumption. To test the
stability of these findings, the final analysis was replicated in 2541 same-aged
adolescents from NHANES 1999­2002; the results were very similar.
Conclusions: These cross-sectional analyses suggest that intakes of dairy, grains
and total fruits and vegetables are inversely associated with central obesity among
adolescents.

Central obesity is a key component of the metabolic
syndrome(1), which is associated with increased risks
of CVD and diabetes(2­4). Intra-abdominal visceral fat is
particularly reactive to lipolytic stimuli and is believed to
affect glucose homeostasis through its effect on circulat-
ing adiponectin levels(5). As central obesity is more
strongly associated with visceral fat than BMI, waist cir-
cumference (WC) has been proposed as the more sensi-
tive measure of relative CVD risk(6,7).
The metabolic syndrome has been identified in chil-
dren and adolescents(8) as well as adults and appears to
persist from childhood into adulthood(9). Trends of
increasing overweight(10) and central obesity(11) among
children and adolescents are well documented. Some
studies indicate that central adiposity among children
may be increasing independent of weight(12,13). As a
surrogate measure of central body fat, WC has been
suggested as an important early marker for the develop-
ment of chronic diseases(14,15) as well as a practical
screening tool for identifying children at risk for meta-
bolic syndrome(16,17).
Although some studies have considered the role of
dietary patterns in the development of central obesity
among adults(18­21), data related to the role of food group
intake in the development of central obesity at younger
ages is very limited. The US Department of Agriculture's
(USDA) Food Guide Pyramid and Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (issued every five years) provide food-based
intake guidelines for children and adults(22). Unfortu-
nately, there is little direct scientific evidence to support

specific dietary recommendations for the prevention of
childhood obesity, particularly central obesity. The con-
sumption of different amounts and types of foods may
impact adiposity in a variety of direct and indirect ways.
For example, different foods may impact satiety through
volumetric differences, effects on gastric emptying or
energy content. Other foods are theorized to affect body
weight through their impact on such factors as energy
metabolism or storage, lipogenesis or insulin sensitivity.
The goal of the current analyses was to explore the
relationship of mean food group intake and anthropo-
metric measures of central obesity in children (aged 5­11
years) and adolescents (aged 12­16 years) using cross-
sectional data from the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994).
Methods
Study population
NHANES have been conducted regularly since 1960 to
assess the health and dietary status of the civilian non-
institutionalized US population aged 2 months and older.
The surveys randomly select subjects using a stratified,
multistage probability cluster design and oversample
certain groups including young children, non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican-Americans. Details of the design and
sampling methods as well procedures for obtaining
informed consent have been described elsewhere(23). The
current secondary analyses were conducted with the
approval of the Boston University Institutional Review
Board. Since dietary habits may change particularly dur-
ing late adolescence, we restricted the analyses to sub-
jects who were less than 17 years of age in order to
reduce the likelihood that true changes in diet would
impact the estimates of usual intake(24).
The primary analyses include subjects who were 5­16
years of age and in one of three categories of racial or
ethnic origin: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican-Americans. A total of 4329 children aged
5­11 years children (or their parents) and 2079 adoles-
cents aged 12­16 years completed interviews and an
examination. The number of subjects (n 99) in the other
racial/ethnic groups was insufficient to provide stable
estimates of association, so these subjects were excluded
from the analyses as has been recommended by the
NHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines(25). Sub-
jects with dietary data designated as missing or unreliable
(n 317) by the study nutritionist or with extremes of
energy intake (the upper and lower 2 % of the distribution
of energy intake; n 227) were excluded, as were those
who were pregnant or breast-feeding (n 18), taking dia-
betes medication (n 8), had missing data for WC cir-
cumference (n 128) or had potential confounders of
interest to the study (n 47). This resulted in a final sample
size of 3761 children aged 5­11 years and 1803 adolescents
aged 12­16 years. Skinfold measurement data were
missing for an additional 112 subjects who were therefore
excluded from any sub-analyses related to that outcome.
Similar exclusion criteria were used for the 1999­2002
NHANES study population of 12- to 16-year-olds, leaving
2541 available for the analysis.
Assessment of dietary intake
Dietary intake in both NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2002 was assessed through a single 24 h recall using
an automated, microcomputer-based interview(26). Prior
to age 12, the recall was completed jointly by the subject
and a proxy respondent. Dietary recalls were analysed
for nutrient composition using USDA nutrient files
appropriate to the time period.
Food Pyramid servings of the five major food groups
(i.e. dairy, fruit, vegetables, grains and meats/other pro-
teins) were calculated from intake of both simple foods
(e.g. glass of milk) and mixed dishes (e.g. lasagne) as
defined by the USDA Dietary Guidelines(27,28). One dairy
serving was defined as 1 cup of milk or yoghurt, 1?5 oz of
natural cheese or 2 oz of processed cheese. A fruit serving
equalled 1 medium fruit (e.g. apple, banana, orange), 1/2
cup of chopped, cooked or canned fruit, or 3/4 cup of
fruit juice. Total fruit (whole or as juice) was also divided
into two subgroups: (i) citrus, melons and berries; and (ii)
other fruits. One vegetable serving comprised 1 cup of
raw leafy vegetables, 1/2 cup of cut-up raw or cooked
other vegetables, or 3/4 cup of vegetable juice. There
were several vegetable subgroups including dark-green
vegetables, deep-yellow vegetables, white potatoes, other
starchy vegetables (including legumes), tomatoes and
other vegetables. French fries were included with pota-
toes but the added fat from frying was counted as ser-
vings of discretionary fat (see below). A grain serving
(whole and refined) was represented by 1 slice of bread,
1 cup of dry cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked rice, pasta or
cereal. Finally, the meat/protein group included all forms
of meat, fish, poultry, eggs, soyabean products, nuts and
seeds. For the purposes of estimating intake, servings in
the meat/other protein group were expressed as ounce
equivalents and included items such as 1 oz of lean meat,
fish or poultry, 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, an egg, or 2
tablespoons of peanut butter(29). Discretionary fats refer-
red to fat in food that is above the amount that would be
expected in a lean, low-fat or fat-free form of the food.
Assessment of anthropometric measures of
central obesity
WC served as the main measure of central adiposity in
these analyses, while the sum of suprailiac and sub-
scapular skinfold thicknesses served as a secondary
measure. Waist measurements were taken on a horizontal
line at the high point of the iliac crest. The measurement
was made at minimal respiration to the nearest 0?1 cm.
Skinfold thickness measurements were taken using a

Holtain skinfold calliper following a standard protocol
and recorded to the nearest 0?1 mm. For NHANES
1999­2002, only WC was examined as an outcome (the
sum of the two skinfolds was not available).
Assessment of potential confounders
Parental education (classified as less than high school,
high school and more than high school) was used as an
indicator of socio-economic status (SES). Income was
assessed as a secondary measure of SES in these analyses
using a dichotomous classification of ,$20 000 v. $20 000
or more (since nearly 10 % of NHANES III subjects failed
to provide more precise data on annual income). In the
NHANES III sample, parental education was retained in
the final models as it confounded the main results. Since
this variable was not available in the 1999­2002 surveys,
parental income was used instead. The three categories
of race/ethnicity as defined by NHANES included non-
Hispanic blacks, Hispanic (specifically Mexican-American)
and non-Hispanic whites.
Pubertal development was assessed during the physical
examination by physicians who were given standardized
training in the use of Tanner stage classification(30,31). For
the purpose of the present analyses, the original 5-stage
Tanner scale was collapsed into three categories: (i) stage
1 or 2; (ii) stage 3; and (iii) stage 4 or 5. Tanner stage
classification was not available for NHANES 1999­2002.
Television watching was assessed in both surveys by
questioning the child (or parent, depending on age)
about the number of hours of television watched the
previous day. Weight and standing height were measured
according to a standardized protocol and BMI was cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in metres (kg/m2).
Physical activity was assessed among children aged 8
years and above by questionnaire. We examined it as a
potential confounder in the models for adolescents but
later dropped it as it led to no change in the results.
Statistical methods
Given the cross-sectional study design, both the anthro-
pometry measures and the dietary intakes were measured
at the same time. In these analyses, we examined the
adjusted mean dietary intakes associated with age- and
sex-specific quartiles of WC (and the sum of subscapular
and suprailiac skinfold measures). The adjusted mean
level of intake in each quartile of central body fat was
estimated using analysis of covariance modelling with
PROC GLM in the SAS statistical software package version
9?1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
In addition to the use of quartiles for categorizing the
distributions of central adiposity, we also examined the
association between the mean intakes in each of the five
major food groups and related subgroups and the pre-
valence of central obesity. Since there are no specific cut-
off points for defining an abnormal waist size in children,
we chose to explore both the 85th and the 90th age- and
sex-specific percentiles. Although the 90th percentile of
waist size has been used in some guidelines for defining
the metabolic syndrome in children(32), we found that the
associations between food intake and waist size using the
85th yielded very similar results and greater statistical
power and so we present only that analysis. To allow for
the comparison of the analysis results from the 1999­2002
surveys with those from NHANES III, we used the same
age- and sex-specific cut points of WC (derived from the
NHANES III distributions) to define children with ($85th
percentile) and without (,85th percentile) central obesity.
The potential confounders retained in the final models
were those that led to meaningful changes in the adjusted
mean dietary intakes, including age, race/ethnicity,
height, number of hours of daily television viewing,
Tanner stage of pubertal development and parental
education or income level. For the approximately 1?5 % of
subjects who had missing data on parental education, we
used a dummy variable to substitute missing education
information. Analyses were conducted including and
excluding the dummy variable for education and the
results were nearly identical, leading us to conclude that
the inclusion of these subjects was unbiased.
Results
Descriptive characteristics for the 3761 children aged 5­11
years and the 1803 adolescents aged 12­16 years are
shown in Table 1. On average, the 5- to 11-year-olds were
slightly less than 8 years of age while the adolescents
were about 14 years of age. Boys in both age groups
consumed more dairy, vegetables, grains and meats/other
non-dairy proteins than did girls. While there were no
apparent gender-related differences in WC at these ages,
girls did have higher levels of subcutaneous fat as asses-
sed by the sum of subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds
(P , 0?05 for all).
Tables 2 and 3 show adjusted mean food group intakes
according to the age- and sex-specific quartiles of WC and
sum of two skinfolds. At 5­11 years of age (Table 2) there
were few differences in food intake associated with cate-
gory of central body fat, although boys in the lowest
quartile of WC or sum of two skinfolds consumed about
half a serving less of meat/other protein than those in the
highest quartile (e.g. 3?61 servings/d v. 4?14 servings/d for
WC quartiles 1 and 4, respectively; P for trend50?025).
Among 12- to 16-year-old male and female adolescents
(Table 3), intakes of dairy products and total grains
were inversely associated with both measures of central
body fat. For example, those in the lowest quartile of WC
consumed nearly half a serving more of dairy per day
than those in the highest quartile (P for trend 5 0?001 and
0?015 for girls and boys, respectively). Similarly, those
in the smallest WC quartile consumed more than one

additional serving of grain per day than those in the
highest quartile (P for trend 5 0?0003 and 0?011 for girls
and boys, respectively). Neither fruit nor vegetable intake
was associated with central adiposity in girls. However,
adolescent boys with the largest waist (and skinfold)
measures consumed the least amount of fruit (P for
trend 5 0?016 and 0?012 for WC and skinfolds, respec-
tively) and the fewest vegetables (P for trend 5 0?016 for
WC). Finally, there was also a tendency for adolescent
boys in the lowest quartile of WC to consume less meat (P
for trend 5 0?047).
Table 4 examines the association between food intake
and central obesity by classifying those with WC at or
above the age- and sex-specific 85th percentile as having
central obesity. We conducted the analyses in both
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002. The analyses in
Table 4 are restricted to adolescents. Identical analyses
were carried out among 5- to 11-year-old children (not
shown) but, as was found in Table 2, there were no
meaningful or statistically significant differences in the
major food group intakes associated with WC. In both
surveys, adolescents with central obesity (WC $ 85th
percentile) consumed less dairy and fewer grains and had
lower intakes of total fruit and vegetables (P 5 0?0002,
P , 0?0001 and P 5 0?045, respectively, in NHANES III;
P 5 0?0009, P 5 0?0002 and P 5 0?062, respectively, in
NHANES 1999­2002). While the majority of the dairy
consumed was in the form of milk, both milk (P 5 0?004)
and cheese intakes (P 5 0?020) were inversely associated
with central obesity in NHANES III while only the asso-
ciation with milk consumption was significantly different
(P 5 0?0008) in the later NHANES sample; too few sub-
jects consumed yoghurt to evaluate its effect separately.
Central obesity was similarly related to whole and refined
grain intakes (P 5 0?002 and P 5 0?001, respectively, in
NHANES III; P 5 0?006 and P 5 0?003, respectively, in
NHANES 1999­2002). There was no consistent association
between central obesity and the intake of meat and meat
equivalents. Finally, we compared the discretionary fat
intakes of children with and without central obesity, and
found that children without central obesity reported
consuming more discretionary fat than children with
central obesity (P , 0?0001 in NHANES III; P 5 0?003 in
NHANES 1999­2002).
Discussion
The present paper explores the relationship between
food group intake and central obesity among children
and adolescents. The results suggest that intakes of dairy
and grains as well as the combined intakes of fruit and

vegetables are associated with lower levels of central
body fat, particularly among adolescents.
The literature related to dietary intake and central obesity
in children is very limited. These results are consistent with a
report from the National Growth and Health Study which
found that adolescent white females following a `healthy
dietary pattern' (i.e. higher intakes of dairy, fruits, vegetables
and grains) had smaller increases in WC over 10 years(33). A
larger number of studies have examined the relationship of
food group intake and overall adiposity among children.
Regarding dairy, for instance, some data indicate that higher
dairy intakes are associated with significantly lower body fat
levels through childhood(34­36), although a review of the
evidence in 2005 concluded that there was insufficient evi-
dence at that time to draw firm conclusions regarding the
effect of Ca or dairy intake on body fat(37).
While higher fruit and vegetable consumption is thought
to be associated with a healthy body weight in children, a
recent review concluded that more evidence is needed to
support this conclusion(38) and it has been suggested that
the methods of preparation (e.g. frying) and serving (e.g.
with sauce) may account for the apparent inconsistent
protective effect. Data on the relationship of grains and
weight in children are limited. One prospective study
demonstrated smaller annual weight change in relation to
each additional serving of breads/grains(39) and another(40)
found that cereal consumption was related to lower BMI;
neither of these studies distinguished between refined
and whole grains. In the current cross-sectional study, we
saw that adolescents whose waist circumference was
above the 85th percentile reported consuming less dis-
cretionary fat than those with less central body fat. There
are several possible explanations for this finding. First,
reporting bias is a possibility, with more under-reporting
of added fat among children with more central adiposity.
It could be, however, that more overweight adolescents are
in fact consuming less added fat. For example, in our own
observations (ML Singer and LL Moore, unpublished
results), we found that overweight children and adolescents
more often consumed low-fat dairy products than those
who are of normal weight. Finally, we note that discre-
tionary fat does not necessarily reflect the total fat load of

the diet. The correlations between discretionary fat and
percentage of energy from total fat were 0?56 and 0?58 in
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 samples, respectively.
Several studies have examined food group intake and
central obesity among adults. One such cross-sectional
study of middle-aged adults found an inverse relationship
between a dietary pattern characterized by frequent
intake of raw and salad vegetables and seasonal fruits
(and low intakes of fried foods including potatoes) and
central obesity(18). One prospective study found that a
pattern characterized by high intakes of fruit, vegetables,
reduced-fat dairy and whole grains and low intakes of red
and processed meat was associated with smaller gains in
central obesity(18), while another found an inverse asso-
ciation between a dietary pattern of high fruits and
vegetables and low-fat dairy and WC among women(41).
The CARDIA study identified an inverse association
between higher dairy intake and lower waist:hip ratio
among young adults(42) and at least one small trial found
dairy to be inversely related to central fat loss among
obese subjects(43). Similar results have been found for
whole grain consumption and cereal fibre(44,45). In terms
of meat intake, high intakes of both red and processed
meat have been shown to be positively related to the
likelihood of central weight gain over a 10-year period in
several studies(46,47).
A number of possible explanations exist for the find-
ings of these studies. Dairy foods have been hypothesized
to be associated with lower levels of body fat through the
effects of their Ca content on lipogenesis(48). Dairy is also
an important source of protein and protein-rich diets have
been shown to promote satiety(49). The dairy protein,
whey, is also a rich source of the essential amino acid
leucine that is involved in the partitioning of dietary
energy(50). The effects of whole grains on obesity are
believed to relate to their soluble fibre content, which is
associated with increased satiety, delayed gastric empty-
ing and enhanced insulin sensitivity(51,52). Fruits and
vegetables are also important sources of fibre and may
have similar effects on satiety and satiation(53).
The limitations of our exploratory study must be
acknowledged. As with any self-reported dietary record,
there is the real possibility of misrepresentation of dietary
intake. Subjects for whom weight or body proportions are
of concern may certainly tend to understate aspects of
their intake. The cross-sectional design of NHANES also
prevents any conclusions related to cause and effect.
The availability of a single day's dietary recall limits the
precision of the estimated dietary intakes of individuals.
However, a single 24 h dietary recall provides accurate
estimates of mean dietary intake within groups(54). Thus,
the recalls used in NHANES are appropriate for quanti-
fying mean food intakes associated with quartiles of
central body fat.
The NHANES data set offers important strengths as
well. The large, randomly selected group of children and
adolescents provides sufficient power to explore a broad
range of intake levels in different food groups. The
availability of data from each of the USDA Food Pyramid
groups, including information from single food sources
and mixed dishes, is a strength of the study. Most studies
of food effects on health outcomes have relied on intakes
from FFQ, which yield less precise estimates of food
servings from all sources. For example, it is not possible
to extract the actual number of grain servings from all
sources in an FFQ since many of the servings would be
derived from composite foods such as pizza or lasagne.
In summary, the current cross-sectional study demon-
strates an association between the patterns of food intake
during adolescence and the prevalence of excess central
body fat. The intakes of dairy and grains, especially
whole grains, as well as total fruits and vegetables were
inversely associated with central obesity among these
adolescents. These associations were not fully explained
by total body fat as measured by BMI.
The USDA provides food-based dietary guidelines that
are specific to age, sex and physical activity level. Pro-
spective studies are needed to test the effects of these
recommendations on the development of central obesity
in children and adolescents. The present study is an
important first step towards such future work.
