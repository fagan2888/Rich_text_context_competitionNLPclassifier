IMPORTANCE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among US adolescents, and
in-home firearm access is an independent risk factor for suicide. Given recommendations to
limit firearm access by those with mental health risk factors for suicide, we hypothesized that
adolescents with such risk factors would be less likely to report in-home firearm access.
OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of self-reported in-home firearm access among US
adolescents, to quantify the lifetime prevalence of mental illness and suicidality (ie, suicidal
ideation, planning, or attempt) among adolescents living with a firearm in the home, and to
compare the prevalence of in-home firearm access between adolescents with and without
specific mental health risk factors for suicide.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis of data from the National
Comorbidity Survey­Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative survey of 10 123 US
adolescents (age range, 13-18 years) who were interviewed between February 2001 and
January 2004 (response rate 82.9%).
EXPOSURES Risk factors for suicide, including a history of any mental health disorder,
suicidality, or any combination of the 2.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported access to a firearm in the home.
RESULTS One in three respondents (2778 [29.1%]) of the weighted survey sample reported
living in a home with a firearm and responded to a question about firearm access; 1089
(40.9%) of those adolescents reported easy access to and the ability to shoot that firearm.
Among adolescents with a firearm in home, those with access were significantly more likely
to be older (15.6 vs 15.1 years), male (70.1% vs 50.9%), of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity
(86.6% vs 78.3%), and living in high-income households (40.0% vs 31.8%), and in rural areas
(28.1% vs 22.6%) (P < .05 for all). Adolescents with firearm access also had a higher lifetime
prevalence of alcohol abuse (10.1% vs 3.8%, P < .001) and drug abuse (11.4% vs 6.9%, P < .01)
compared with those without firearm access. In multivariable analyses, adolescents with a
history of mental illness without a history of suicidality (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.13; 95% CI,
0.98-1.29) and adolescents with a history of suicidality with or without a history of mental
illness (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.96-1.51) were as likely to report in-home firearm access as those
without such histories.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents with risk factors for suicide were just as likely to
report in-home firearm access as those without such risk factors. Given that firearms are the
second most common means of suicide among adolescents, further attention to developing
and implementing evidence-based strategies to decrease firearm access in this age group is
warranted.

In 2010, suicide was the second leading cause of death
among adolescents 13 to 18 years old in the United States
(5.38 deaths per 100 000).1 Approximately 12% of adoles-
cents report a history of suicidal ideation, and 4% have at-
tempted suicide.2 Firearms account for almost half of all sui-
cides among this age group1,3 and are the most lethal manner
by which suicide is attempted.3 Approximately 90% of sui-
cide attempts by firearm result in death.3,4
The presence of a firearm in the home is an important risk
factor for suicide.5 Individuals living in households with fire-
armsaremorelikelytomakesuicideplansinvolvingafirearm,6
and in case-control studies7-13 the presence of a firearm in the
home was consistently associated with suicide deaths, espe-
cially among adolescents. In areas where firearm ownership
rates are high, suicide rates are also high.14,15
Psychiatricriskfactorsforadolescentsuicide,includingsub-
stanceusedisorders,mooddisorders(eg,majordepression),and
a history of suicidal behavior, are well established.16,17 How-
ever, firearm availability may increase the risk of suicide above
baseline psychiatric risk.18,19
Safe firearm storage practices (eg, storing firearms un-
loaded, locked, and separate from locked ammunition) to de-
crease firearm access by adolescents are also important. Sui-
cide attempts are often impulsive acts20 and frequently occur
after an acute stressor (eg, an interpersonal dispute).21 Twenty-
four percent of 153 adolescents and young adults who sur-
vived an almost lethal suicide attempt reported that less than
5minuteselapsedfromthetimewhentheydecidedtoendtheir
life and when they attempted suicide.20 Therefore, safe stor-
age practices may decrease suicide risk by reducing immedi-
ate access to lethal means. In fact, investigators have ob-
served a lower suicide risk in households where safe storage
practices exist than in those where firearms are stored un-
locked or loaded.5,12,22,23
In the United States, approximately 1 in 3 adolescents lives
inahomewithafirearm.24-26 Resultsfromsurveysofadultfire-
armownershavesuggestedthatalargeproportionofthosefire-
arms are stored unlocked or loaded,25,27,28 and a study29 based
on 1995 data found that almost 25% of adolescents have ac-
cess to a firearm in the home.
Given the association between firearm access and the risk
of injury and suicide among adolescents, professional orga-
nizations such as the American Psychological Association and
the American Academy of Pediatrics have long recom-
mended addressing safe storage practices with families, par-
ticularly those with at-risk youth in the home.30-33 If these rec-
ommendations are effectively implemented, the prevalence
of firearm access should be lower among adolescents at risk
of suicide. While the relationship between mental health and
in-home firearm access has been studied in adults,34 little in-
formation exists regarding firearm access among adolescents
with mental health disorders, arguably the group most at risk
of self-inflicted firearm injuries. Understanding the preva-
lence of in-home firearm access among adolescents with and
without mental illness is important for informing public policy
and designing interventions. Aims of this study were (1) to es-
timate the prevalence of self-reported in-home firearm ac-
cess among a 2001 to 2004 nationally representative sample
of US adolescents, (2) to quantify the lifetime prevalence of
mental illness and suicidality among adolescents living with
a firearm in the home, and (3) to compare among adolescents
with a firearm in the home the prevalence of in-home firearm
access between adolescents with and without specific men-
tal health risk factors for suicide.
Methods
Data Source
The human subjects committees of Harvard Medical School,
Boston, Massachusetts, and the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, approved all original National Comorbidity Survey­
Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) procedures. Participants' par-
ents or guardians provided written informed consent, and par-
ticipants provided written assent. This analysis of deidentified
data did not require institutional review board approval by the
University of Washington Human Subjects Division.
The NCS-A35 is a nationally representative survey of 10 123
adolescents (age range, 13-18 years) who were interviewed be-
tween February 2001 and January 2004. The survey used a
dual-frame sampling strategy to recruit participants from Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication36 households (n = 879)
and from schools located in counties representative of those
in the replication survey (n = 9244). The overall response rate
was 82.9%. Poststratification weights were applied to ad-
dress within-household probability of selection and differ-
encesinrespondentcharacteristicscomparedwiththoseofthe
US population. Survey weighting and methods have been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere.35
Sociodemographic Variables
We abstracted the following sociodemographic variables for
each respondent: age, sex, ratio of family income to the fed-
eralpovertylevel,parentaleducation,numberofbiologicalpar-
ents living in the home, level of urbanicity, and US census re-
gion. We also abstracted self-reported race/ethnicity because
firearm ownership and storage patterns vary by this
characteristic.37 Race/ethnicity classifications initially de-
fined by the NCS-A were categorized as non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, or other.
Mental Health Disorders
The NCS-A assessed participants' mental health histories using
a modified version of the World Health Organization Compos-
ite International Diagnostic Interview.38 The Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview was validated among adoles-
cents, and diagnoses are based on the DSM-IV.39 We used
diagnostic hierarchy rules to identify specific lifetime and re-
cent (preceding 12 months) mental health disorders, includ-
ing mood, anxiety, behavioral, and substance use disorders.40
We also quantified the total number of lifetime mental health
disorders for each participant (0, 1, 2, or more).
Suicidality
The NCS-A assessed any history of suicidal thoughts and be-
haviors using a modified version of the suicidal behavior mod-

ule of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.38,41
We identified lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation using the
question"[Haveyou]everseriouslythoughtaboutkillingyour-
self?" Of those who reported suicidal ideation, we identified
lifetime suicide planning and attempts using the questions
"[Have you] made a plan for killing yourself" and "[Have you]
tried to kill yourself?" We identified recent suicidal ideation,
planning, and attempts using similar questions specific to the
preceding 12 months.
Firearm Access
We identified the presence of 1 or more functioning firearms
in the home using the question "How many guns that are in
working condition do you have in your house, including hand-
guns, rifles, and shotguns?" Among those with at least 1 fire-
arm in the home, we assessed firearm access using the ques-
tion "Could you get [the gun/one of the guns] and shoot it right
now if you wanted to? Or is either the gun or the ammunition
put away where you can't get it?" Potential responses were
"could get it," "could not get it," and "could maybe get it with
great effort." We defined access to a firearm in the home as yes
(ie,couldgetit)orno(ie,couldnotgetit)andcategorizedthose
who answered "could maybe get it with great effort" as miss-
ing (n = 135).
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the proportion of US adolescents with in-home
firearm access using the full, weighted NCS-A sample. We then
describedsociodemographiccharacteristicsandmentalhealth
histories of respondents who reported at least 1 functioning
firearm in the home and answered the firearm access ques-
tion (yes or no). We defined our outcome of interest as self-
reported in-home firearm (yes or no) and used t tests and 2
teststocomparedifferencesincontinuousandcategoricalvari-
ables,respectively,betweenadolescentswithandwithoutfire-
arm access. The exposures of interest were a lifetime history
of any mental health disorder, a lifetime history of suicidality
(ie, suicidal ideation, planning, or attempt), or any combina-
tion of the 2. We used Poisson regression with robust SE of the
variance to obtain prevalence ratio estimates and correspond-
ing CIs, and we compared the prevalence of in-home firearm
access between adolescents without suicide risk factors (ie, no
lifetime mental health disorders or suicidality) and adoles-
centswith(1)alifetimehistoryofamentalhealthdisorderwith-
out a history of suicidality and (2) a lifetime history of suicid-
ality with or without a history of a mental health disorder. In
each model, we included the following covariables based on
their a priori relevance: age, sex, race/ethnicity, ratio of fam-
ily income to the federal poverty level, level of urbanicity, and
US census region.
To determine whether the relationship between suicide
risk and firearm access differed by age or sex, we analyzed 2
separate multivariable models. These included the following
interaction terms: (1) age (continuous variable) and suicide risk
category and (2) sex and suicide risk category.
To determine whether the relationship between suicide
risk and firearm access was dependent on proximity or sever-
ity of mental illness, we performed 2 subgroup analyses. First,
we repeated our main analyses using only 12-month histories
of mental health disorders and suicidality. Second, we com-
pared the prevalence of in-home firearm access between ado-
lescentswithnolifetimehistoryofsuicideriskfactorsandado-
lescents who reported a suicide attempt in the preceding
12 months. We used STATA statistical software (version 12.0;
StataCorp LP) for all analyses.
Results
Overall, 2921 (30.7%) of the weighted NCS-A sample reported
1 or more functioning firearms in the home and 2778 (29.1%)
reported 1 or more functioning firearms in the home and re-
sponded to the firearm access question. Of those, 1089 (40.9%)
reported easy access to and the ability to shoot that firearm
(Table 1).
Sociodemographic Characteristics
The mean age of the weighted study sample was 15.3 years;
58.7% were male, 81.7% were of non-Hispanic white race/
ethnicity, 34.3% lived in major metropolitan areas, and 44.5%
lived in the South (Table 1). Compared with adolescents with-
out firearm access, those with access were significantly more
likely to be older (15.6 vs 15.1 years), male (70.1% vs 50.9%), of
non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (86.6% vs 78.3%), and liv-
ing in high-income households (40.0% vs 31.8%) and in rural
areas (28.1% vs 22.6%) (P < .05 for all).
Mental Health Disorders
Fifty-one percent of the weighted study sample met criteria
for at least 1 lifetime mental health disorder, and 28.9% met
criteriaforatleast2lifetimedisorders(Table2).Comparedwith
adolescents without firearm access, a greater proportion of
those with firearm access met criteria for 1 or more lifetime
mental health disorders (53.6% vs 49.2%, P = .04). Compared
with adolescents without firearm access, a greater propor-
tion of those with access had a recent history of alcohol abuse
(8.2% vs 2.9%), a lifetime history of alcohol abuse (10.1% vs
3.8%), and a lifetime history of drug abuse (11.4% vs 6.9%), and
a smaller proportion had a lifetime history of panic disorder
(0.7% vs 3.0%) (P < .01 for all).
Suicidality
Thirteen percent of the weighted study sample reported a life-
time history of suicidal ideation, and 4.1% reported a lifetime
history of suicide attempt (Table 2). Recent suicidal ideation
and attempts were reported by 5.8% and 1.8% of the sample,
respectively.Nostatisticallysignificantdifferenceswerefound
in recent or lifetime suicidal ideation, planning, or attempts
between adolescents with and without firearm access.
Suicide Risk Factors and Firearm Access
In unadjusted and multivariable analyses, there were no sta-
tistically significant differences in firearm access between ado-
lescents without suicide risk factors (ie, lifetime mental health
disorder or suicidality) and either those with a lifetime his-
tory of a mental health disorder without suicidality or those

with a lifetime history of suicidality with or without a history
ofmentalhealthdisorder(Table3).Insummary,olderage,male
sex, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, and residence in a non-
metropolitan location were independently associated with in-
creased likelihood of reporting in-home firearm access (eTable
in the Supplement). No statistically significant interactions
were found between age or sex and suicide risk categories in
their effect on firearm access.
In subgroup analyses limited to recent (preceding 12
months) mental health disorders and suicidality, there were
no statistically significant differences in firearm access be-
tween adolescents with and without suicide risk factors. There
was no statistically significant difference in firearm access be-
tweenadolescentswithoutalifetimehistoryofamentalhealth
disorder or suicidality and adolescents who reported a recent
suicide attempt.

Our estimate of firearm prevalence among households
with adolescents is consistent with estimates reported
elsewhere.25,26 In addition, our estimate of adolescent in-
home firearm access is similar to estimates based on storage
practices reported by adult firearm owners in other national
samples.25,26,42 To our knowledge, the most recent estimate
of adolescent-reported firearm access is from a study29 of 1995
data finding that 24.3% of US adolescents reported in-home
firearm access, almost double our estimate. Reasons for this
discrepancyareunclear.TheNCS-Amayhaveidentifiedamore
specific subset of adolescents by asking about both immedi-
ate access (ie, "right now") and the ability to shoot the fire-
arm. Regardless, our study confirms that a large proportion of
US adolescents have in-home firearm access.
This study makes several important contributions to the
firearm access literature. Most studies25,26,28 have focused on
parentorguardianreportofstoragepracticesasaproxyforado-
lescent firearm access (eg, storing a firearm unlocked). How-
ever, such reports tell us little about whether adolescents can
access the firearm and, perhaps more important, whether ado-
lescents are aware that they can access the firearm. By focus-
ing exclusively on adult storage practices, prior studies25,26,28
fail to address an important aspect of firearm access: adoles-
cents may be able to access and shoot a firearm even if that
firearm is stored locked, unloaded, and separate from locked
ammunition.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehen-
sively describe the burden of mental illness among adoles-
centswithfirearmaccess.Wefoundthattheprevalenceofmost
mental health disorders and suicidality was similar between
adolescents with and without firearm access and, most im-
portant, was similar to previously reported estimates of these
disorders among the general US adolescent population.2,40
However, those with access were more likely to endorse a his-
tory of alcohol and drug abuse, findings that are particularly
concerning given prior research demonstrating greater odds
of substance abuse and firearm access among suicide
decedents.43,44 This is consistent with previous studies find-
ingthat10%ofUSadolescentshaveaccesstobothfirearmsand
alcohol in the home29 and that parents with substance abuse
problems were more likely to report storing a firearm un-
safely than parents without such problems.45 Given that alco-
hol and drug­related disorders cluster within families,46 these
findings may help explain the increased firearm access among
adolescents with substance abuse histories.
Becauseofrecommendationstolimitfirearmaccessamong
adolescents with suicide risk factors,31,33 we hypothesized that
such adolescents would be less likely to report firearm access
than those without suicide risk factors. However, we ob-
servednodifferenceinfirearmaccessbetweenriskgroupseven
in subgroup analyses limited to adolescents who had recent
mental health disorders or those who reported a recent sui-
cide attempt compared with adolescents who had no lifetime
risk factors. This suggests that many parents or guardians of
adolescents with suicide risk factors and a firearm in the home
may not be aware or convinced that (1) their child has access
to the firearm,47 (2) firearm access is a risk to their child, or (3)
limiting firearm access may mitigate the risk of having a fire-
arm in the home. The prevalence estimates of DSM-IV disor-
ders obtained by the NCS-A do not represent formal clinical
diagnoses. Therefore, these findings may also represent un-
recognized mental health risk factors among US adolescents.
Although the objective of this study was to address fire-
arm access among adolescents at risk of suicide, these find-
ings have several other important implications. First, adoles-
cents and adults living in homes with firearms, particularly
loaded or unlocked firearms, are disproportionately at risk of
other firearm-related injuries, including unintentional shoot-
ings and homicide.22,48 Second, we estimated that almost 1 in
4 adolescents living in a home with a firearm has a lifetime be-
havioral disorder such as intermittent explosive disorder or
conduct disorder. Several of these illnesses are associated with
increased risk of personal injury or violent behavior.49,50 The
implications of firearm access among this population are un-
clear. Third, these analyses are based on data collected from
2001 to 2004. That we have identified a high prevalence of fire-
arm access among adolescents with suicide risk factors un-
derscores the importance of reassessing this issue among the
present US adolescent population.
These findings present an area for intervention by policy
makers,healthcaresystems,healthcareprofessionals,andpar-
ents. Safe storage practices may reduce the likelihood of fire-
arm injuries among adolescents,12,22,51 are recommended by
professional organizations,31,33 and are a focus of the Insti-
tute of Medicine's recommendations for firearm injury
prevention.52 The limited literature on this subject demon-
strates that most parents are unlikely to comply with health
care professionals' recommendations to remove firearms from
their home.53,54 However, studies55,56 have shown that health
care professional and clinic­based firearm interventions to im-
prove firearm storage practices are acceptable to parents, and
a growing body of evidence suggests that brief interventions
delivered in clinical settings can decrease adolescent firearm
risk behaviors, including alcohol use problems and weapon
carrying.57,58 In fact, community and clinic­based random-
ized interventions have demonstrated efficacy in improving
safe storage practices among firearm owners, including par-
ents with children in the home.54,59-63

This study has several limitations. First, these analyses are
based on data collected from 2001 to 2004 and do not reflect
changes in firearm ownership or access since that time. Sec-
ond, we defined adolescents at risk of suicide using any his-
tory of a mental health disorder or suicidality. Most important,
someadolescentshavecompletedsuicidewithoutidentifiedhis-
toriesofmentalillness.7 Third,theseestimatesarebasedonado-
lescent reporting of firearm access and are subject to misclas-
sification bias if adolescents incorrectly believe that they do or
do not have access to a firearm. Fourth, parent report of ado-
lescent mental health disorders has been shown to improve di-
agnostic accuracy in the NCS-A sample, particularly for behav-
ioral diagnoses. Although lack of parent report may have led to
underestimates of some disorders, it is unlikely that differen-
tialmisclassificationbetweenadolescentswithandwithoutfire-
arm access biased these results.
Conclusions
In summary, a substantial proportion of US adolescents re-
ported in-home firearm access, and those with suicide risk fac-
tors were just as likely to report access as adolescents without
such risk factors. Given the significant morbidity and mortal-
ityassociatedwithfirearminjuriesamongthispopulation,par-
ticularly by self-directed violence, further attention to devel-
opingandimplementingevidence-basedstrategiestodecrease
firearm access among adolescents is warranted.
