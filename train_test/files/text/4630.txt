Introduction
Older adults experiencing hip fractures may find their lives
irrevocably changed. The estimated number of new cases of
hip fracture in Japan was 117,900 in 2002, doubling from
the 53,000 cases reported in 1987. Hip fracture is the third
leading cause of becoming bedridden following stroke and
frailty due to advanced old age in Japan (Ministry of Health
Labour and Welfare, 2005). Furthermore, the risk of mortal-
ity increases due to the severe injury and complications
after hip fracture (Hasegawa, Suzuki, & Wingstrand, 2007).
Even in cases of successful recovery, increased needs for
extensive care and institutionalization are often reported
(Alexander, Rivara, & Wolf, 1992; Yoshimura, Suzuki,
Hosoi, & Orimo, 2005).
Preventing hip fracture is a public health priority in the
Japanese society given the ongoing transition to the super-
aging society. By 2050, the population age 65 years and older
is expected to reach 40% of the total Japanese population
(Cabinet Office, 2007). Even if the age-specific incidence
rates of hip fractures stay constant, the total number of
individuals experiencing hip fracture is likely to follow the
number of older adults (Cummings & Melton, 2002). Hip
fracture is known to be an expensive injury due to intensive
medical treatment and follow-up care (Cummings & Melton,
2002; Rizzo et al., 1998). In addition to the current pension
budget crisis, further medical expense would be tremendous
burden on the Japanese society (Kunieda, 2002).
More than 90% of hip fractures are attributable to falls in
the older population (Youm, Koval, Kummer, & Zuckerman,
1999). Constructing hip fracture prevention strategies
requires an understanding of the risk factors for falls. Thus,
sources of potential risk factors for hip fracture will be
identified from the literature about falls risk factors. Many
studies have identified risk factors of hip fracture in Western
countries (Otaka, Riu, Uzawa, & Chino, 2003). Given the
known gender differences in hip fracture risk factors
(Cummings et al., 1995), this study conducts analyses of risk
factors separately for women and men. Although some
Japanese studies investigated risk factors of hip fracture
using the large samples (Suzuki et al., 1997), further popula-
tion-level research is necessary for developing higher quality
intervention programs from public health perspectives. The
purpose of this study is to identify the risk factors of hip
fracture in the relatively understudied population of Japanese
older adults using nationally representative data.

Risk Factors for Hip Fracture in
Japanese Older Adults
TakashiYamashita1 and A. John Bailer2
Abstract
Risk factors for hip fracture in Japanese older populations are understudied compared withWestern countries arguably due to
the relatively lower prevalence rates in Japan.Nationally representative data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal
Study of Aging were analyzed using logistic regression to examine possible risk factors of hip fractures, separately for older
women (n = 2,859) and older men (n = 2,108).Results showed that older Japanese women with difficulty bending their knees
(OR = 1.9), with diabetes (OR = 1.7 times), and/or with more activity of daily living limitations (OR = 1.1) had higher risks of
hip fracture. Older Japanese men with difficulty bending their knees (OR = 2.6), who use more external prescription drugs
(OR = 1.9), and with cancer (OR = 2.0 times) had higher risks of hip fracture. Further considerations of gender- and culture-
specific factors along with the identified risk factors may provide insights into future intervention programs for hip fracture
in Japanese older populations.

initiated by the Nihon University Center for Information
Networking in 1999. NUJLSOA used a multistage probabil-
ity sampling method to collect nationally representative
data of Japanese older adults age 65 and older. Trained
interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews using a
structured questionnaire. Those who were 75 years and
older were oversampled for the purpose of detailed analysis
of the oldest old population. The NUJLSOAsurvey included
a wide range of questions such as demographic information,
socioeconomic status, medical history, lifestyle, and health/
disability status of Japanese older adults. For this study,
only community-dwelling older adults (N = 4,967) were
analyzed after excluding those who were institutionalized
(n = 30).
ResponseVariable
The respondents who answered yes to the question, "Have
you ever experienced or are currently experiencing fractures
fissures (femur, hips)?" were coded 1 and others were coded
0 for the variable hip fracture.
PredictorVariables
Risk factors of falls and hip fracture were selected as pre-
dictor variables. A collection of potential risk factors along
with relevant references are displayed in Table 1. Potentially
related factors and available variables in the NUJLSOA
Wave 1 including demographic and socioeconomic factors,
medical conditions, functional limitations and physical
health, and environmental factors are also identified in this
table.
Demographic and socioeconomic factors. Age and education
were included in the analyses. Age is a continuous variable.
Education was reported as the respondent's last education
level completed and has six levels: (a) junior high school, (b)
high school, (c) schools for specialized studies, (d) junior
college, (e) university, and (f) graduate school. The educa-
tion variables were dichotomized into (0) less than high
school or (1) higher than high school education due to the
highly skewed distribution showing that the majority of
respondents had high school or less education completed.
Medical conditions and history. The indicators of demen-
tia, heart problem, cancer, diabetes, cataracts, glaucoma,
arthritis, osteoporosis, and back pain were included in the
analysis. Each variable was coded whether the respondents
had the condition (1) or not (0). For medication use, the
total number of internal prescribed medications and non-
prescribed medications used were separately taken into
account. The external prescribed medications variable was
dichotomized into the respondents who used at least one
external prescribed medication (1) and those who did not
(0) given the highly skewed distribution. When female
respondents gave birth to more than five children, they
were coded 1 and others 0.
Functional limitation and physical health characteristic.
Activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activity of
daily living (IADL) were included as variables to assess
functional limitations. The ADL variable corresponded to
the number of ADL problems associated with eating, dress-
ing, showering, getting out of bed, walking across room,
going outside of house, and toileting experienced by an
individual. The IADL variable corresponded to the number
of IADL problems, including difficulty with preparing
meals, shopping, taking care of bills, using telephone, clean-
ing, taking a bus, and managing medications. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. The
variable height (cm) was also taken into account. Variables
measuring physical ability included walking 200 to 300 m;
grasping with fingers and bending knee were coded 1 if the
respondents had difficulty performing or 0 if they did not,
respectively. A self-rated variable of overall health was
coded 1 if the respondents reported positive health as very
healthy, healthier than average, or average health, and the
other was coded 0.
Environmental factor. The variable rural was coded 1 if the
respondents reported living in farming or fishing village and
was coded 0 if they reported living in city or suburb areas.
This variable accounts for the geographical difference in
diet. Japanese people living in rural areas are more likely to
have higher salt intake than those in urban areas (Yamagu-
chi, 1995). Higher salt intake is associated with lower bone
density among postmenopausal women (Devine, Criddle,
Dick, Kerr, & Prince, 1995); therefore, it may be a relevant
factor of hip fracture (Suzuki et al., 1997).
Statistical Methods
Summary statistics for the predictor variables were com-
puted for the respondents with hip fracture and those without
hip fracture, separately for women and men. Means and
standard deviations for continuous variables, and percent-
ages for dichotomous variables were computed. Independent
t tests were used to assess differences in means between
those with hip fracture and those without for continuous
variables, and chi-square tests were used to assess differ-
ences for categorical variables. Logistic regression was used
to model the odds of hip fracture on demographic and socio-
economic factors, medical condition, functional limitation
and physical health, lifestyle, and environmental factors
(Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2004). All analyses were performed
with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Results
Table 2 shows a comparison of predictor variables between
individuals with and without hip fracture stratified by gen-
der: women (n = 2,859) and men (n = 2,108). Overall, 349
out of 4,967 or 7% of the respondents had at least one hip
Yamashita and Bailer 3
fracture. The respondents with hip fracture were, on average,
1 year older than individuals not experiencing a hip fracture
(76.6 vs. 75.3), and their prevalence rates of diabetes (13%
vs. 8%), osteoporosis (13% vs. 7%), the number of internal
prescription drugs (2.5 vs. 2.1), and use of external prescrip-
tion drugs (37% vs. 25%) were higher compared with those
without. In addition, the respondents with hip fracture
reported more difficulty bending their knee (45% vs. 24%),
higher mean number of difficulty with ADLs (1.0 vs. 0.4) or
IADLs (1.4 vs. 0.90), and lower self-rated health (54% vs.
67% for positive self-rated health) compared with those
without, respectively.

Among older women, those with hip fracture were older
(77.4 vs. 75.8) and reported higher prevalence of diabetes
(15% vs. 7%), back pain (25% vs. 17%), osteoporosis (20%
vs. 11%), higher average number of internal (2.7 vs. 2.1)
prescription drugs, and more use of external prescription
drugs (42% vs. 29%) than those without. In addition,
women who had a hip fracture were more likely to report
difficulty with grasping with fingers (9% vs. 5%), bending
their knee (54% vs. 29%), along with more ADL (1.3 vs.
0.5) and IADL (1.7 vs. 0.9) difficulties, and lower self-
rated health (46% vs. 65%) compared with those without,
respectively.
Among older men, those who had hip fracture were older
(75.6 vs. 74.5) and had higher prevalence rates of cancer
(13% vs. 8%) and use of external prescribed drugs (32% vs.
19%) when compared with those men without hip fracture.
In addition, older men who had a hip fracture were more
likely to report difficulty to bend knee (33% vs. 15%).
Table 3 shows the results of logistic regression analyses
for women and men. Among older Japanese women, diabet-
ics had 1.7 times the odds of hip fracture (95% confidence
interval [CI] = [1.1, 2.6]) than those nondiabetics holding all
other risk factors constant. Whereas older women with dif-
ficulty bending their knee and more difficulty with ADLs

ficulty bending their knee had 2.6 (95% CI = [1.7, 4.1]) times
the odds of hip fracture than those who did not. However, the
individuals with back pain had 43% lower odds of hip frac-
ture than those without.
Discussion
This study examined the risk factors of hip fracture for older
Japanese women and men separately using the nationally
representative Japanese data set, NUJLSOA. In older
Japanese women, diabetes, difficulty bending their knee,
and more ADL limitations were associated with increased
risk of hip fracture, whereas difficulty to grasp with fingers
was associated with lower risk. In addition, in older Japanese
men, cancer, use of external prescription drugs, and diffi-
culty bending their knee were associated with increased risk
of hip fracture, whereas back pain was associated with lower
risk.
In this study, age and education were not associated with
hip fracture unlike some of the past studies (Wei, Hu, Wang,
& Hwang, 2001). However, one Japanese study reported that
age was not a risk factor of hip fracture (Yamanashi et al.,
2005). Although age was not independently associated with
risk of hip fracture in this study, a number of factors that tend
to increase with age seemed to be associated with increased
risk of hip fracture. For example, ADL limitations, back
pain, and use of prescription drugs generally increase with

ages. Indeed, these factors were independently associated
with risk of hip fracture in the current study. Education may
influence the variables considered in this study but did not
seem to be a direct risk factor of hip fracture.
Two chronic illnesses, diabetes and cancer, were associ-
ated with increased risk of hip fracture in women and men,
respectively. This finding supports some of the previous
studies. Schwartz et al. (2001) found that diabetics had a
greater risk of hip and proximal humerus fracture after
adjusting for bone mineral density and demographic factors.
In addition, Mexican American older adults with diabetes
were at higher risks of hip fracture after adjusting for covari-
ates such as demographic factors and BMI (Ottenbacher,
Ostir, Peek, Goodwin, & Markides, 2002). Although the
occurrence mechanism of how particular chronic illnesses
influence hip fracture risk is still unclear, complications from
diabetes such as diabetes-related visual impairment, and/or
cancer treatments including hormone therapy and androgen
deprivation therapy for particular cancers seem to indirectly
increase risk of hip fracture (Kanis, McCloskey, et al., 1999;
Lopez et al., 2005; Ottenbacher et al., 2002; Schwartz et al.,
2001). On a relevant note, more attention should be paid to
other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepine) known to be associated
with fall risks, which may reflect existence of illnesses or
other physical conditions along with particular chronic ill-
nesses in addition to those examined in this study (Cummings
et al., 1995; Grisso et al., 1997).
Difficulty bending a knee was associated with increased
risk of hip fracture among older Japanese women and men.
There are two potential mechanisms that might explain this
association. First, difficulty bending the knee presumably
works as a mediator of the relationship between falls and hip
fracture (Nguyen, Pongchaiyakul, Center, Eisman, &
Nguyen, 2005). That is to say, not being able to bend the
knee comfortably could result in instability of posture that
may lead to falls (Lord et al., 1994). Second, difficulty bend-
ing knee may have an influence on the trauma of one's hip
when a fall occurs. Indeed, hitting the knee first on the
ground and changing direction of the fall can alleviate the
impact on hip and avoid hip fracture (Pinilla, Boardman,
Bouxsein, Myers, & Hayes, 1996; Runge, Rehfeld, &
Resnicek, 2000). This finding suggests that educating older
adults about how to fall safely along with potential conse-
quences of hip fracture may be a reasonable strategy as a
future public health intervention. In addition, such findings
could help understand possible etiological explanations
about the associations between ADL, physical fitness, and
falls (Lau, Woo, Leung, & Swaminthan, 1993). Two protec-
tive factors, difficulty grasping with fingers in women and
back pain in men, are arguably related to lower activities lev-
els, which may indicate lower risk of falls and, in turn, hip
fracture.
It should be noted that osteoporosis was not associated
with risk of hip fracture in this study. In general, osteoporosis
or lower bone mineral density is a definitive indicator of
bone fragility (Cummings & Melton, 2002). Whereas osteo-
porosis is reported as a risk factor of hip fracture (Lau et al.,
2001; Lau et al., 1993), it is a protective factor in other stud-
ies (Kanis, Johnell, et al., 1999). It may be possible that
osteoporosis would be a risk factor only when there was a
significant impact on one's hip like when one falls.
There are several important contributions from the find-
ings in this study. First, this study examined hip fracture risk
factors in the understudied older Japanese population. Given
the lower prevalence of hip fracture comparing with Western
nations, only a few studies have focused on hip fracture at
the population level in Japan while it still is a serious public
health problem. Second, this study identified different risk
factors of hip fracture for older Japanese women and men.
Most previous studies considered gender as a risk factor or
focused only on either women or men. Last, no previous
study examined risk factors of hip fracture with NUJLSOA,
which is one of a few publicly available large data sets of
Japanese older adults. Secondary data analysis using nation-
ally representative data in aging population is not yet com-
mon in Japanese hip fracture studies.
Some limitations in this study should be noted. First,
Japanese specific cultural aspects were not taken into
account. Although not examined in this study, typical but
distinctive Japanese diets such as fish, tofu, and natto (fer-
mented soybeans), and use of Japanese traditional futon are
possible protective factors of fracture (Suzuki et al., 1997).
Second, although we identified risk factors for hip fracture,
the predictive accuracy of logistic regression models in this
study may not be sufficient for routine use. Follow-up analy-
ses using the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC) showed the moderate predictive accuracy,
AUC (women, men) = (0.71, 0.67); the models could
improve by incorporating omitted risk factors of hip fracture
(DeMaris, 2004; Swets, 1988). Third, the finding regarding
back pain requires caution as the estimated odds ratio was
small although statistically significant. Finally, the
NUJLSOA does not include information about timing of hip
fracture and possible consequences (e.g., functional limita-
tions). Therefore, any causal inference or examination of hip
fracture treatment outcomes was not possible. However, the
respondents were community-dwelling older adults who are
still at risk of hip fracture. In this regard, identification of
risk factors regardless of previous hip fracture experience is
meaningful. Although this study included a single wave of
data, as further consecutive waves of NUJLSOA become
available, longitudinal analyses may allow for the inclusion
of additional risk factors including a previous history of
falls.
In conclusion, this study identified risk factors of hip frac-
ture by developing hip fracture prediction models separately
for older Japanese women and men using the nationally rep-
resentative data. Diabetes, difficulty to bend knee, difficulty
to grasp with fingers (protective factor), and ADL limitations
were associated with risk of hip fracture among older
Yamashita and Bailer 7
Japanese women. Cancer, use of external prescribed drugs,
back pain (protective factor), and difficulty to bend knee
were associated with increased risk of hip fracture among
older Japanese men. These identified risk factors including
physical impairments and functional limitations, and their
causal pathways to hip fracture need to be further examined
with consideration of gender difference and specific cultural
aspects of study populations in future research.
