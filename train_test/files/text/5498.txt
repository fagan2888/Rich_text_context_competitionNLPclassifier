Introduction
There is an increasing trend in the prevalence of mental dis-
orders (Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010) and severe psychological
problems among university students. About 21
percent of
freshmen (Wong et al., 2006) experience some degree of
depression, and 38percent of university students report feel-
ing hopeless (American College Health Association, 2006).
The potential negative outcomes of psychological problems
among university students have been well documented (e.g.
Hefner and Eisenberg, 2009). For example, depressed indi-
viduals are at least 20 times more likely to commit suicide
than the general population (Lépine and Briley, 2011).
Negative psychological well-being is a global public con-
cern (American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2010;
Capron and Schmidt, 2012), and, hence, research has been
called for greater understanding of their correlates (e.g.
Cranford et al., 2009; Kessler et al., 2005).
Psychological well-being and health-risk
behaviors
An extensive body of literature demonstrates that mental
health problems in early adulthood are associated with sub-
stance use, suicide, and physical inactivity. For instance,
life satisfaction is widely evidenced to be negatively linked
with smoking, drinking, suicide, and physical inactivity
among university students in different cultures (e.g. Grant
et al., 2009). Other psychological factors (i.e. depression
and hopelessness) are also positively associated with

Abstract
While literature has displayed a link between psychological well-being (i.e. depression, hopelessness, and life satisfaction)
and health-risk behaviors (i.e. smoking, drinking, suicide, and physical inactivity), the mechanisms underlying this
relationship have received little empirical attention. This study examines the mediation effects of social support (from
family, friends, and significant others) that accounted for the link. Participants were 2023 university students (47.7%
male). Structural equation modeling showed partial mediation effect of social support between psychological well-being
and health-risk behaviors. In particular, social support from family and friends jointly mediated about 80percent of the
effect of life satisfaction and hopelessness on drinking. These results offered novel evidence that helps improve theorizing
the mechanisms of the relationship between psychological well-being and health-risk behaviors. They also highlighted the
potential benefits of social support for university students to help them stay healthy. The implications of these results
are discussed.

health-risk behaviors, including alcohol consumption
(Geisner et al., 2012; Gonzalez and Hewell, 2012), suicidal
thoughts (Hawton et al., 2013), and physical inactivity
(Taliaferro et al., 2009; Tyson et al., 2010). Although
the research literature is clear that psychological well-being
is associated with health-risk behaviors, not much research
has been done to fill the gap in the mechanisms how psy-
chological correlates are associated with unhealthy
behaviors.
Social support, psychological well-being and
health-risk behaviors
Social support is a likely candidate to explain the associa-
tion between psychological well-being and health-risk
behaviors. Good mental health, such as low rates of hope-
lessness (Merkas and Brajsa-Zganec, 2011), depression
(Lakey and Orehek, 2011), and high life satisfaction
(Proctor et al., 2009), has been linked to social support.
Social support has also been studied as a protective factor
against health-risk behaviors, such as smoking and drink-
ing (e.g. Piko and Kovács, 2010; Walsh et al., 2010).
Recently, there is a growing interest in studying the mediat-
ing role of social support (e.g. Eather et al., 2013; Zhao
et al., 2014). For example, Babiss and Gangwisch (2009)
found that the relationship between depression and sports
participation was mediated by social support. They con-
cluded that depressive symptoms could possibly function
to decrease social support from peers and family members,
which, in turn, lowers an individual's motivation to partici-
pate in physical activity. Hence, it is possible that psycho-
logical well-being influences health-risk behaviors through
its effect on social support.
When examining the impact of social support, it is
important to take diverse social agents into account (Rueger
et al., 2010). Family as the primary and first source of sup-
port is not only associated with greater life satisfaction
(Nickerson and Nagle, 2004), lower depression (Rueger
et al., 2010), and hopelessness (Kerr et al., 2006) but also
linked with a lower level of health-risk behaviors, for
instance, tobacco and alcohol use (Allahverdipour et al.,
2015; Kristjánsson et al., 2010), suicidal ideation (Kerr
et al., 2006), and physical inactivity (Kim and Cardinal,
2010).
However, friends and significant others play a more
influential role during young adulthood than during adoles-
cence (Fatoba and Bzdzikot, 2015; Pugliese and Okun,
2014). Young adults spend more time with their peers and
depend less on family emotionally and financially (Arnett,
2000). They start exploring extra-familial influences during
college years (Windle, 2000). Therefore, it is advocated to
examine the influence of support from different social
agents for a better understanding of the support processes
in the development of health-risk behaviors among young
adults.
The influence of social support from friends has been
shown in different domains, including psychological well-
being (Sheets and Mohr, 2009), physical activity (Pugliese
and Okun, 2014), and health-risk behaviors (Kristjánsson
et al., 2010). However, literature displays mixed results of
friends' support. Some studies demonstrated that peer sup-
port was positively related to involvement in health-risk
behaviors and negative mental well-being (e.g. Walsh et al.,
2010). On the other hand, some studies exhibited that
higher support from friends was associated with positive
psychological well-being (Sheets and Mohr, 2009) and bet-
ter psychological adaptation when facing stressful life
events (Fatoba and Bzdzikot, 2015).
One possible explanation for these mixed results comes
from the measurement strategy for assessing social support
from friends. Some studies examined social support from
peers (friends) without distinguishing significant others (e.g.
close/best friends or romantic partners) from general friends
(peers) (Pugliese and Okun, 2014); whereas, other studies
distinguished significant others from friends (Malinauskas,
2010), romantic partners from friends (Ratelle et al., 2013), or
close friends from classmates (Fatoba and Bzdzikot, 2015). In
particular, Rueger et al. (2010) found that support from gen-
eral peers, but not close friend support, had negative associa-
tions with depression. Perhaps, differentiating significant
others from friends provides a clearer understanding of the
impact from different social agents. Thus, research assessing
the distinctive contributions of support from friends and sig-
nificant others is warranted.
This study
This study aimed to understand more the mechanisms under-
lying the relationship between psychological well-being and
health-risk behaviors by (1) assessing the mediating role of
social support from family, friends, and significant others in
the relationship between psychological well-being (i.e.
depression, hopelessness, and life satisfaction) and unhealthy
behaviors (i.e. smoking, drinking, suicidal thoughts, and
physical inactivity) and (2) comparing the relative influences
of the three types of social agents as mediators. Based on the
relevant literature, two hypotheses were proposed:
Hypothesis 1. Social support from the three agents
would mediate the relationship between psychological
well-being and health-risk behaviors.
Hypothesis 2. The effects of social support would vary
with different social agents.
Methods
Participants and procedures
Prior to data collection, ethical approval was obtained from
the University Review Board. Formal consent was obtained
Lai and Ma 3
from the participants or the parents of the participants
below age 18. Their participations were not compensated.
Participants were recruited from a local university in 2014
(N=2023; male: n=965, 47.7%; female: n=1057, 52.3%).
The participants were mainly Chinese (n=1896, 94%) and
freshmen (n=1952, 96.7%), with mean age=18.7years,
standard deviation=1.29years. Demographic information
of the participants is presented in Supplementary Table 1. A
questionnaire, including relevant measures, was distributed
to and completed by each participant within 15minutes.
Measures
Life satisfaction.Life satisfaction was measured using the
5-item Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener et al.,
1985). The Chinese version has good validity and reliabil-
ity (e.g. Ma and Shek, 2013). The response options ranged
from 0=not present to 5=constantly present over the past
month. In this study, the total scores ranged from 0 to 25,
and the mean scores of the five items ranged from 0 to 5.
Hopelessness. Hopelessness was measured by the Chinese
version of 5-item Hopelessness Scale (Shek, 1993), which
has been used in many studies in Chinese contexts (e.g.
Shek and Li, 2016). A 6-point scale, where 0=not present
to 5=constantly present over the past month, was used to
yield a total scale score ranging from 0 to 25 and a mean
score ranging from 0 to 5.
Depression.
Depressive symptoms were measured by
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al.,
1999). The scale has been validated in the Chinese popula-
tion (Yu et al., 2012). The response options ranged from
0=not at all to 3=nearly every day. In this study, the total
scores ranged from 0 to 27, and the mean scores of the nine
items ranged from 0 to 3.
Perceived social support.Perceived social support was
assessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived
Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet et al., 1988). This scale
consists of 12 items that measure perceived social support
from three sources: family (e.g. "My family really tries to
help me"), friends (e.g. "I can count on my friends when
things go wrong"), and significant others (e.g. "I have a
special person who is a real source of comfort to me"). The
MSPSS has good psychometric properties (Chou, 2012;
Zimet et al., 1988). A 4-point scale, where 1=strongly disa-
gree and 4
=
strongly agree, was used with a higher score
reflecting a greater level of perceived social support (range
of scores is presented in Table 1).
Smoking and drinking.Smoking and drinking behaviors
were measured by two separate questions that were used in
prior studies (e.g. Shek and Yu, 2012). The participants
were invited to indicate the frequency of using different
types of substances (i.e. tobacco and alcohol) in the last
3
months. The response options ranged from 0
=
never in
my lifetime to 6=more than five times per week and yielded
a score ranging from 0 to 6.
Suicidal thoughts.Having suicidal thoughts was measured
by one question. The participants were invited to indicate
the frequency of having suicidal thoughts in the last
3
months to assess whether the participants had seriously
considered committing suicide. This question was adopted
from the Suicidal Behavior Scale, which was demonstrated
to be valid and reliable (Law and Shek, 2013). The response
options were the same as in the question about smoking and
yielded a score ranging from 0 to 5.
Physical inactivity level. Physical activity level was measured
via one question. This question assessed participants' fre-
quency of participation in moderate to vigorous physical
activities, such as swimming and cycling, in the previous
week. The response options ranged from 0=never to 7=over
seven times per week (one time equaled to at least 30min-
utes) and yielded a score ranging from 0 to 7.
Demographic information (covariates).Participants were
invited to indicate their gender, their place of birth, their
year of birth, and the academic year they are in. These char-
acteristics were included as previous studies showed that
these demographic characteristics were associated with
psychological well-being and health-risk behaviors among
university students (e.g. Husky et al., 2008; Johnston et al.,
2007; Kristjánsson et al., 2010).
Statistical analyses
The measurement model was tested by confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) to assess the extent to which each of the
latent variables was represented by its indicators. The meas-
urement model with acceptable fit was considered as the
final model of each latent variable. According to each final
measurement model, three indicators with the highest load-
ings were used to represent each latent variable in the later
analyses. Path analyses within structural equation modeling
(SEM) were specified to test the proposed hypotheses.
Overall model fit was evaluated based on the values of the
chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic (2), the comparative fit
index (CFI), the Tucker­Lewis Fit Index (TLI), the root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the
standardized root mean square residuals (SRMR), which
were considered acceptable fit if CFI and TLI.90 (Bentler,
1990; Kline, 1998); RMSEA<.08 (Hooper et al., 2008); and
SRMR
<
.08 (Hu and Bentler, 1999). All CFA and SEM
analyses were performed with Mplus, version 7.31 (Muthén
and Muthén, 2016 [1998]).

Results
Descriptive analyses
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and the interrelation-
ships of the variables. Cronbach's  values were above .70,
indicating good internal consistency of all scales tested
(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). Values of kurtosis and
skewness (i.e. kurtosis

7 and skewness

2; West et al.,
1995) suggested that the data of all variables were normally
distributed, except for smoking and suicidal thoughts. The
levels of depression and hopelessness were low, with the
mean score of 1.02 and 1.15, respectively. The mean score
of life satisfaction was 3.10.
The prevalence of health-risk behaviors was low (see
Supplementary Table 2(a)). Over 96percent of the respond-
ents indicated that they had never smoked, and more than
95
percent indicated that they had never had suicidal
thoughts. Of the respondents, 64.8
percent reported that
they had never drunk alcohol in their life or in the past
3months. However, while only 8.6percent of the respond-
ents met the national guidelines for physical activity
(American College Health Association, 2012), 19.9percent
of the participants indicated that they had not participated
in any moderate or vigorous physical activities that last
more than 30minutes, in the past 7days (see Supplementary
Table 2(b)). There were no demographic differences in hav-
ing suicidal thoughts (p
>
.05) as detected by Chi-square
test. Smoking, drinking, and meeting the national guide-
lines for exercise were more common among males
(p
<
.001). Smoking was less prevalent among students
who, aged 18years or below, were local or in their first year
of university studies (p
<
.001). It was more common that
students who were non-Chinese or aged above 18years had
drunk alcohol in the last 3months (p<.001).
Measurement model (CFA)
All measurement models were estimated by maximum like-
lihood (ML). All error variances were initially set to be
uncorrelated. Given the unfavorable fit of the initial models
for life satisfaction, depression, and hopelessness, item con-
tent and modification index (MI) were examined. Error
covariances were sequentially set for a model re-run. The
final models for each variable revealed a better fit, including
bigger CFI, TLI and smaller RMSEA, SRMR. Two models
(one-factor and three-factor) were run for perceived social
support. The three-factor model was retained as the final
model due to the design of this study and better model fit.
Supplementary Table 3 presents all CFAmodels'fit indexes.
Structural equation model (path analysis)
All structural equation models were performed with maxi-
mum likelihood estimation robust (MLR) to non-normality
due to deviation from normal distribution (Finney and

Mediation by perceived social support
Path analysis was performed to examine the mediating
roles of perceived social support in the relationships
between psychological well-being and health-risk behav-
iors (Figure 1). Perceived social support (three factors) was
included as mediators, and variables related to psychologi-
cal well-being were included as predictors of health-risk
behaviors. An error covariance was set between two con-
structs (i.e. social support from friends and significant oth-
ers) in the final model due to the unfavorable fit of the
initial model. The final model had a better model fit (S-B2
(242)=1488.683, RMSEA=.05 (90% confidence interval
(CI)=.048-.053), CFI=.93, TLI=.91, SRMR=.08).
Figure 1 shows the significant standardized path coeffi-
cients and R-square statistics. Support from family was sig-
nificantly related to life satisfaction, hopelessness, drinking,
and suicidal thoughts. Support from friends was significantly
associated with life satisfaction, depression, hopelessness,
and drinking. Support from significant others had significant
associations with life satisfaction, depression, and hopeless-
ness. Smoking and physical inactivity had a marginally non-
significant association with support from family (=-.11,
p=.051) and friends (=-.08, p=.053), respectively.
Asymmetric CIs based on bootstrap methods (MacKinnon,
2008) with a bootstrap draw of 10,000 samples were
employed for testing the significance of the mediation of
perceived social support. Mediating effect with the 95per-
cent bootstrap CI excluding zero was considered as signifi-
cant. The magnitude of the mediation was estimated with
the proportion of the mediating effect in the sum of all
direct and mediating effects' absolute values.
Table 2 displays the total mediating effects, specific
mediating effects, and the corresponding 95
percent CIs.
Examination of the specific indirect effects revealed that
support from family significantly mediated the effects of
life satisfaction and hopelessness on smoking, drinking,
and suicidal thoughts individually. The six indirect effects
had an estimate ranging from -.05 to .03 and magnitude
ranging from 10.4 to 52.7
percent (see Table 3). Support

from friends was a significant mediator of the effects of life
satisfaction, hopelessness, and depression on drinking and
physical inactivity separately. The six indirect effects had an
estimate ranging from -.03 to .04 and magnitude ranging
from 3.3 to 36.4percent (see Table 3). In particular, support
from family and friends jointly mediated the effects of life
satisfaction on drinking (magnitude=78.8%) and the effects
of hopelessness on drinking (magnitude
=
81.8%). The sup-
port from significant others had no significant indirect effect.
Discussion
This study attempted to examine the mediating role of per-
ceived social support in the relationship between psychologi-
cal well-being and health-risk behaviors. As hypothesized,
social support significantly mediated the link between psy-
chological well-being and health-risk behaviors. In addition,
the mediating role of social support and its magnitude varied
with the sources of support.
Mediation by perceived social support from
family
The result indicated that psychological well-being pre-
dicted unhealthy behaviors through the mediating effect of
perceived family support. In other words, individuals with
higher life satisfaction and lower hopelessness had the pro-
pensity to perceive more family support, which was, in
turn, related to less smoking, drinking, and suicidal
thoughts. This is consistent with prior research, which
showed the positive roles of family support in university
students' alcohol use (Abar and Turrisi, 2008), cigarette
smoking (Allahverdipour et al., 2015), and suicidal idea-
tion (Arria et al., 2009). This study provides evidence that
life satisfaction and hope do not only affect adolescents'
perceived family support (Jiang et al., 2013; Piko and
Hamvai, 2010) but also affect young adults' perceived
family support. Unexpectedly, it was found that family
support did not contribute significantly to the prediction of
physical inactivity. Parental support has been identified as
a key correlate of adolescent's participation in physical
activity (Trost et al., 2003). However, there is evidence
that friends have more influence on university students'
frequency of doing exercise than family has (Okun et al.,
2002). Therefore, it is plausible that once the other media-
tors, such as friends support, were controlled, the predict-
ing power of family support diminished. The results
revealed that depression did not exert a significant effect
on family support. Although this is contrary to the correla-
tion found in previous studies (e.g. Rueger et al., 2010),
this is consistent with the findings of Stice et al. (2004),
which showed that depression did not predict prospective
change in parental support. More research is needed to
understand the unclear relationship.
Mediation by perceived social support from
friends
Our findings revealed that support from friends played a
significant mediating role in the impact of psychological
well-being (i.e. depression, hopelessness, and life satis-
faction) on drinking and physical inactivity. This is con-
sistent with findings of many studies that individuals with
lower life satisfaction, higher hopelessness, and depres-
sion generally perceive less social support from friends
(e.g. Hagen et al., 2005; Kong et al., 2012; Sheets and
Mohr, 2009). The result demonstrated that individuals
with more support from friends engaged in higher levels
of physical activity and drinking. This indicates that the
positive effect of friends support on level of physical
activity does not only exhibit in adolescents (Kim and
Cardinal, 2010) but also in young adults. Moreover, the
mediating effect of support from friends on the positive
relation between depression and physical inactivity is
consistent with the findings where social support has been
found to be a partial mediator of the association among
adolescents (Babiss and Gangwisch, 2009). Given that
university students perceive alcohol use as a social norm
(Borsari and Carey, 2003) and almost half of the partici-
pants reported drinking in the past, our findings are in
alignment with the research that links social support with
drinking (Taylor, 2007); peer support had positive effect
on the level of drinking when the young adult had friends
who drank. Our findings provide support to Hypothesis 2
that the support from family and friends had unique medi-
ating effects. For example, the results revealed that family
support decreased alcohol consumption but friends' sup-
port increased it (see Figure 1). Moreover, family support
mediated more proportions of the effect (52.7%) than
friends' support did (29.1%) in the prediction of drinking
by hopelessness (see Table 3).

Mediation by perceived social support from
significant others
Unexpectedly, support from significant others was signifi-
cantly associated with psychological well-being but did not
significantly relate to any unhealthy behavior and had no
mediating effect. Hypothesis 1 was partially supported.
This is probably because most participants in this study
were freshmen, and the data were collected during the first
2weeks of the first semester. A review of the literature sug-
gested that first-year university students are generally mak-
ing a transition into new social networks when they enter
university (Brissette et al., 2002). Previous studies indi-
cated that the significant others of an adolescent are usually
their teachers (Rueger et al., 2010), close friends (Rueger
et al., 2010), or romantic partners (Ratelle et al., 2013).
However, it is common that individuals get less in touch
with their significant others (e.g. best/close friends) of their
past social groups after they enter university (Cummings
et al., 2006; Oswald and Clark, 2003), especially when they
go to different universities or when one of them goes to
university but the other one does not. Most participants
(first-year university students) of this study might have not
yet developed social networks with new significant others
in their current social group or context. Hence, future
research may explore the mediation using a longitudinal
design.
Conclusion
In general, the results showed that perceived social support
from family and friends partially accounted for the effects
of psychological well-being on health-risk behaviors. In
particular, social support from family and friends jointly
mediated the effects from life satisfaction to drinking and
from hopelessness to drinking, explaining about 80percent
of the effect from life satisfaction and hopelessness to
drinking. These findings suggest that there are other poten-
tial mediating processes underlying the associations
between psychological well-being and health-risk behav-
iors. These processes could involve factors other than social
support or aspects of social support that were not examined
in this study. For example, Uchino (2009) proposed that
both perceived and received social support are related to
healthier behavioral choices (e.g. exercising and less smok-
ing); Babiss and Gangwisch (2009) found that self-esteem
and social support both acted as the mediators of the rela-
tionship between depression and physical inactivity. Future
research is needed to explore possible mediators to fully
explain these relationships.
Limitations
Several limitations should be noted. First, data were col-
lected based on self-report measures. Other methods, such
as focus group interview, could be useful to help under-
stand the current findings. Second, participants were rela-
tively homogeneous (mostly Hong Kong Chinese). Future
study with students from other non-Western countries may
help in the generalizability of the present findings. Finally,
the cross-sectional design of this study was not able to
make any conclusions about the causal relationships
between the variables. A longitudinal design may provide
further insight.
Implications
Despite the above limitations, our findings have theoretical
contributions to the literature and practical implications for
health services. Theoretically, this study represents the first
attempt to investigate the mediating roles of support from
different social agents in order to extend our understanding
of the mechanisms between psychological well-being and
health-risk behaviors among young adults. We examined
the mediating role of social support from a specific agent in
relation to support from other agents in the same model.
The finding that support from family and friends had unique
mediating effects in the associations (i.e. life satisfaction
drinking and hopelessness drinking) offered novel evidence
to improve the theorizing of the mechanisms of these rela-
tions. Practically, the occurrence of multiple health-risk
behaviors (Barnett et al., 2014) among university students
underscored the importance of providing effective preven-
tive programs and interventions. The present findings indi-
cate that interventions should focus on only the "helpful"
intervening factors for an optimal outcome. For instance, it
would be worthwhile to set up schemes to promote family
support for helping university students stay away from
smoking, drinking, and suicidal thoughts; whereas, it would
be instrumental to provide more fitness classes and pro-
grams that aim to cultivate more social support from friends
in order to increase the level of physical activity.
