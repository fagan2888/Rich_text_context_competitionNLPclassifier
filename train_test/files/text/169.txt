Using data from the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey, this study examines the
relationship between marital status and two dimensions of caregiving networks, size and
composition. Results indicate that widowed and never married people have helping
networks that are larger than those of married people. Diversity across marital statuses in
sources of assistance is revealed in analyses of two measures of caregiving network
composition: (a) having more kin than nonkin helpers and (b) presence of specific helpers
(adult children, siblings, friends, and formal helpers). Moreover, gender interacts with
marital status to influence the composition of caregiving networks.

Caregiving Networks of Elderly Persons:
Variation by Marital Status
Anne E. Barrett1 and Scott M. Lynclf
In later life, social networks become increasingly im-
portant to one's comfort and well-being. Many of the
caregivers who assist people with functional impair-
ments in performing activities basic to daily life are
drawn from social networks. Friends and relatives (in-
formal sources of support), along with helpers from
formal organizations, compose the caregiving networks
that assist elderly people with functional limitations.
Finding help for elderly persons who need assistance
and the sources of such support are both influenced
by a number of social structural variables, one of which
is marital status.
To explain patterns in the receipt and source of
social support in later life, several hypotheses have been
offered, including substitution, supplementation, and
task specificity. Although some hypotheses have been
explored more fully than others to explain patterns in
social support by marital status, each can potentially
contribute to understanding the relationship between
marital status and caregiving networks.
The substitution hypothesis argues that when clos-
est relatives, presumably spouses and adult children,
are not available in one's network, more distant re-
latives, friends, and formal helpers are substitutes in
providing needed care (Cumming & Schneider, 1961;
Shanas, 1979). As Shanas (1979, p. 4) explained, "Where
old people have no children, a principle of family sub-
stitution seems to operate and brother, sisters, neph-
ews and nieces often fulfill the roles and assume the
obligations of children." The choice of caregivers is
determined by an ordered preference regarding the

primacy of relationship between the elder and the care-
giver; nence, this hypothesis has been referred to as
the hierarchical-compensatory model (Cantor, 1979).
It would predict, for example, that formerly married
people are more likely to turn to adult children, if
available, compared with the married people who rely
on their spouses. Similarly, a smaller proportion of never-
married people than currently or formerly married people
would be expected to report sons or daughters as helpers
because the never married, especially in current older
cohorts, are less likely to have children. Higher rates
of assistance would be observed among the never married
in help from siblings, other relatives, friends, and for-
mal helpers. The substitution hypothesis has received
support (e.g., Chatters, Taylor, & Jackson, 1986; Pe-
ters, Hoyt, Babchuk, Kaiser, & lljima, 1987; Shanas,
1979; Stoller & Earl, 1983); however, it has also been
criticized for failing to provide a theoretical explana-
tion for the presumably universal ordering of caregiving
preferences (Messeri, Silverstein, & Litwak, 1993).
A second hypothesis, supplementation, argues that
informal support influences one's use of formal care
(Bass & Noelker, 1987; Noelker & Bass, 1989). Pri-
mary caregivers, typically drawn from the informal support
network, function as linkages between the elderly re-
cipient and the formal care system. Informal caregivers
may serve as mediators, referrals, or gatekeepers to
formal care (Ward, Sherman, & LaCory, 1984). For-
mal support is viewed as a supplement rather than as
a substitute to the extensive efforts of primary care-
givers.
The supplementation hypothesis is drawn from ex-
tensions of Andersen's (Andersen & Aday, 1978; Ander-
sen & Newman, 1973) model of health service utili-
zation. In the Andersen framework, use of services is
a function of three sets of factors: need, predisposing,
and enabling characteristics of the individual. Bass
and Noelker (1987) extended this model to include
caregivers' need, predisposing, and enabling charac-

teristics. The relationship of the caregiver to the elder
is viewed as a predisposing factor to receipt of formal
care. Certain kin ties to the recipient of care may be
more strongly associated than other kin or nonkin ties
with use of supplemental formal services. It could, for
example, be posited that having a daughter-in-law or
distant relative as a caregiver is more strongly related
to use of formal services compared with having a daugh-
ter as a caregiver. According to the supplementation
perspective, the overall level of family involvement in
caregiving responsibilities is an enabling factor in ob-
taining formal care. Evidence suggests that the more
involved family members are in caregiving, the greater
the use of formal services, such as in-home nursing or
aide services, that supplement informal care (Bass &
Noelker, 1987).
A third hypothesis, task specificity, is drawn from
differential primary group theory (Litwak & Szelenyi,
1969) and posits that family, friends, and formal help-
ers are suited to different functions in support provi-
sion. They manage complementary components of
a shared goal (Litwak, 1985). The task-specificity hy-
pothesis outlines characteristics of primary groups, in-
cluding proximity, length of commitment, commonal-
ity of lifestyle, and size that differentiate the marital
dyad, other relatives, friends, and neighbors. For ex-
ample, Litwak (1985) argued that the structure of friend-
ship networks is suited to providing services that re-
quire an intermediate time commitment, whereas kin-
snip ties are adapted to fulfilling needs demanding a
more long-term commitment. To specify tasks best man-
aged by formal caregivers, other dimensions are added
(i.e., type of motivation, division of labor, and level of
technical knowledge).
The formulations of these three hypotheses and their
application in research examining patterns of care among
elderly people vary in the degree to which they ad-
dress potential differences by marital status in the size
and composition of caregiving networks. The substitu-
tion hypothesis, with its emphasis on availability of various
sources of support, deals with marital status most di-
rectly, and empirical research from this perspective
has included examinations of marital status. Less at-
tention to marital status is found in research based on
the task-specificity or supplementation hypothesis; how-
ever, these hypotheses are relevant to patterns in care-
giving networks across marital statuses.
Because availability of and reliance on various sources
of informal support differ among married, formerly mar-
ried, and never-married people, the nature of the link-
ages, hypothesized by the supplementation perspec-
tive, between the informal and formal systems of care
are likely to vary by marital status. Examining the rela-
tionship between marital status and caregiving networks
from the supplementation perspective may, for example,
reveal different mechanisms linking formal care to
caregiving by close kin (e.g., adult children who are
more common in the helping networks of the mar-
ried and widowed) and more distant kin and nonkin
(e.g., siblings and friends who are more often caregivers
of the never married).
Patterns in receipt of social support across marital
statuses may be illuminated by the substitution and
supplementation hypotheses; the task-specificity model
brings into focus potential consequences of the varia-
tion oy marital status in composition of caregiving networks.
If, as the task-specificity model posits, some primary
groups are better suited than others to perform cer-
tain tasks with which many elderly persons of all marital
statuses need assistance, then observed differences in
helping network composition represent variation in access
to types of care (e.g., assistance with activities of daily
living [ADLs], financial help, or socioemotional sup-
port). The task-specificity hypothesis includes a substi-
tution principle; it argues that when the optimal group
for performing a task is absent, the available group is
chosen whose structure most closely matches that of
the best group on dimensions particularly relevant to
the task (Litwak, 1985). However, this model also im-
plies that the absence of sources of support best suited
to providing needed assistance may result in a de-
cline in quality of care (Litwak, 1985; Penning, 1990).
This research examines these hypotheses as poten-
tial explanations for variation by marital status in use
of informal and formal support. However, more at-
tention is given to substitution and supplementation
than to task specificity. Because of the considerable
complexity that would be involved in simultaneously
examining the size and composition of helping net-
works as well as specific tasks provided by various care-
givers while controlling for availability of various sup-
port sources across multiple marital statuses, analyses
do not include examinations of specific tasks provided
by caregivers.
Literature Review
Existing literature reveals considerable differences in
the caregiving networks of married, formerly married,
and never-married people. Compared with the mar-
ried, the unmarried are less likely to report having close
family members; however, a higher percentage of the
unmarried have a close friend (McMullin & Marshall,
1996). Findings on reports of close relationships with
friends and family, potential helpers in later life, par-
allel patterns in the actual receipt of support. The care-
giving networks of the unmarried are more likely to
include friends and neighbors than are the networks
of the married (Chatters et al., 1986; Stoller & Earl,
1983). Having a paid helper in one's caregiving net-
work is also more common among the unmarried
(Connidis & McMullin, 1994; Mutchler & Bullers, 1994).
In contrast, the married tend to rely more heavily on
family members, in particular, spouses (Johnson & Cata-
lano, 1981; Longino & Lipman, 1981; Thornton, White-
Means, & Choi, 1993).
Not only does the composition of caregiving net-
works vary by marital status, but so too does helping
network size. However, the findings are inconsistent,
and few studies have examined distinct groups of the
unmarried. Research comparing the married with the
widowed has indicated that caregiving networks of the
married may consist of fewer helpers (Townsend &
Poulshock, 1986). The married also have been found
to have smaller helping networks than a composite
group of the unmarried (Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991). Others,
696 The Gerontologist
however, have reported larger helping networks among
the married compared with the unmarried (Thornton
et al., 1993).
In general, research has suggested that when faced
with disabilities in old age, married couples rely on
one another and are less likely to enlist the aid of
friends or formal helpers than are unmarried elders
(Johnson & Catalano, 1981; Townsend & Poulshock,
1986). Some have argued that this reflects different
processes of social network configuration that occur
among the married and the unmarried Gohnson & Cata-
lano, 1981). Among the married, social regression has
been hypothesized, involving a withdrawal from other
social relations into the interdependence of the mari-
tal bond (Slater, 1963). A process of anticipatory so-
cialization may occur among the unmarried, who use
the range of social resources accumulated over the
life course to meet their needs in later life (Johnson &
Catalano, 1981).
Variation Among the Unmarried
Differences between the helping networks of mar-
ried and unmarried elderly people are striking; further-
more, there is evidence of variation among groups of
the unmarried. Among elderly widows, adult children
are central members of their caregiving networks (Lopata,
1978). Research has also indicated that widows nave
more family ties than never married and separated/
divorced elderly persons (Goldberg, Kantrow, Kremen,
& Lauter, 1986), which may affect the likelihood of
having family members serving as caregivers in later life.
In comparison with the widowed, the never mar-
ried are less likely to have caregiving networks that
include adult children. Among the never married,
siblings are central in provision of support (Cicirelli,
Coward, & Dwyer, 1992), whereas low rates of sib-
ling support are found among widows (Lopata, 1978).
Never-married elderly people also turn to formal sup-
port; the likelihood of receiving help from a paid source
is higher for the never married than for the divorced
or widowed (Connidis & McMullin, 1994). Other dif-
ferences have been found between never married and
divorced elderly persons. For example, the never married
are somewhat less likely to report having a potential
caregiver (Choi, 1996).
Relatively few studies have focused on the helping
networks of divorced or separated elderly people. Tnere
is some evidence, however, that siblings are frequently
found in the caregiving networks of the separated/
divorced; but they are not as prevalent as in networks
of the never married (Cicirelli et al., 1992).
Gender, Marital Status,
and Caregiving Networks
Literature on gender and receipt of care among
elderly people has indicated that differences exist in
the sources of care received by women and men. More-
over, empirical findings and theoretical explanations
provide strong rationales for examining gender within
the context of marital status and social support. In general,
rates of assistance from informal sources are higher
among men, whereas formal care is more common
among women (Coward, Home, & Dwyer; 1992; Stoller
& Cutler, 1992). This pattern may reflect a greater
need for assistance among women, who report worse
health on average than men; however, other expla-
nations hinge on marital status, such as gender differ-
ences in the likelihood of being unmarried.
Several demographic trends, including higher life
expectancy and probability of widowhood among women
and higher rates of remarriage among men, yield the
following: Older women are more likely than men to
be unmarried. As a result, spousal support in later life
is available to more men than women. Prevailing age
differences within couples contribute not only to women's
increased risk of widowhood but also raise their risk
of having a spouse in poor health, which could con-
tribute to increased reliance on formal care.
A moderating effect of gender has been observed
on the relationship between marital status and use of
formal sources. Married women are more likely to use
formal care than married men, but this gender differ-
ence does not exist among the unmarried (Mutchler
& Bullers, 1994). Other research has revealed an ex-
ception to the general pattern of higher use of formal
care among the unmarried: Widowed men use fewer
formal supports than their female peers (Connidis &
McMullin, 1994). There is also evidence of gender dif-
ferences in the effect of marital status on friendship
networks, structures from which informal caregivers
can be drawn; widowhood decreases interaction with
friends among men, but not among women (Hatch &
Bulcroft, 1992; Petrowsky, 1976).
Research Questions
Within the literature on marital status and helping
networks of elderly people, differences between the
married and unmarried have been well documented.
Less is known about variation among unmarried sta-
tuses. This results from a tendency to use one of the
following three strategies. Several studies have focused
on one unmarried status (e.g., Lopata, 1978; O'Bryant,
1988). Others have compared the married with the
unmarried as a single, presumably homogeneous, group
(e.g., Johnson & Catalano, 1981; Longino & Lipman,
1981; Mutchler & Bullers, 1994; Stoller & Earl, 1983;
Thornton et al., 1993). A third group of studies exam-
ines only two marital statuses (e.g., Choi, 1996; Keith,
1983; Kohen, 1983; Petrowsky, 1976; Rice, 1989; Townsend
& Poulshock, 1986).
A few studies on helping networks of elderly people
have examined several marital statuses simultaneously.
Chatters and colleagues (1986) studied elderly Black
Americans; it is not known whether their findings
are generalizable to other racial groups. Connidis and
McMullin (1994) used a Canadian sample of commu-
nity-dwelling elders; however, no control on health
status was included. Therefore, observed relationships
between marital status and composition of helping net-
works may be the result of differences in health status
or of level of need for assistance. In addition, it can-
not be assessed whether level of disability in old age
is related to receipt of assistance from specific sources.
Vol. 39, No. 6, 1999 697
This study examines two dimensions of helping net-
works, size and composition. Previous research has
indicated that network size is associated with access
to support; a larger network increases the availability
of emotional and instrumental support (Seeman & Berk-
man, 1988). Network composition also provides an
indication of access to help. As highlighted by the task-
specificity hypothesis, sources of help vary in their suit-
ability to perform various tasks. Further, sources of help
differ in the duration of assistance that they are likely
to provide (Stolar, Hill, & Tomblin, 1986). Size and
composition are examined because these dimensions
can be expected to vary by marital status; however,
the nature of the relationships between marital status
and network size and composition is not well-under-
stood. For example, it is plausible that the never mar-
ried, having never "married into" a second family, have
smaller helping networks that include more nonkin
members than those of the ever married. Using simi-
lar reasoning, the separated or divorced, who are likely
to have ties to one rather than two sets of extended
families, may have fewer relatives serving as caregivers
compared with the widowed or the married.
This study addresses three questions: Among dis-
abled, community-dwelling elderly people, are there
differences across marital statuses in the size of the
helping network that assists with everyday activities of
life? Does the composition of helping networks, in terms
of informal and formal components, differ by marital
status? Finally, does the effect of marital status on the
size and composition of helping networks differ for
men and women?
Method
Sample
Data were drawn from the 1982 National Long-
Term Care Survey (NLTCS). The 1982 NLTCS is a cross-
sectional survey that began with the selection of ap-
proximately 36,000 persons from Medicare enrollment
files, stratified by geographic region, age, race, and
reason for entitlement. This screening resulted in the
identification of approximately 6,000 persons age 65
or over who had an impairment in at least one ADL
or instrumental ADL (IADL). The NLTCS was an ideal
dataset for addressing the questions posed in this re-
search. The large sample size provided adequate num-
bers of men and women in the less common marital
statuses (i.e., separated/divorced and never married)
allowing us to examine Marital Status x Gender inter-
actions. In addition, it includes detailed information
on the composition of helping networks of commu-
nity-dwelling, disabled elderly people. In these analy-
ses, we deleted incomplete interviews and cases missing
on the primary independent variable, marital status,
yielding a study sample of 5,551.
Measures
Size and Composition of Caregiving Networks.--
Size of caregiving network is a count of up to 15 helpers
reported by the respondent. Because relatives repre-
sent a primary source of support in old age, this study
examines a variable indicating whether one's network
contains more kin than nonkin helpers. From items
referring to the relationship of each reported helper
to the recipient of care, the variable is coded 1 if the
number of kin helpers exceeds the number of unre-
lated helpers. Respondents with fewer kin than nonkin
helpers or an equivalent number of kin and nonkin
helpers are coded 0. A closer examination of the com-
position of networks is made in analyses of whether
one's helping network consists of several different sources
of help. The four types of helpers analyzed include
adult children, siblings, friends, and formal helpers (iden-
tified by respondents as paid helpers or persons from
helping organizations).
Sociodemographic Variables.--Differences among
the unmarried were a focus of this project; therefore,
we treated marital status as a set of four dichotomous
variables. The separated and divorced were combined
into a single category because the small number of
separated elderly people in the sample (n = 61) pre-
cluded examination of the groups independently. The
following variables shown to be related to receipt of
support in later life were included as controls: gen-
der, race, age, income, and education (Choi, 1996;
Coward, 1987; Kohen, 1983; Thornton et al., 1993).
Age ranged from 65 to 108 years. Values on house-
hold income, originally coded as an ordinal variable
(1 = less than $3,000 to 16 = $50,000 or more),
were recoded to the midpoint of each income cat-
egory, allowing income to be treated as a continuous
variable. Education was the highest grade attended,
ranging from 0 to 18 (which represents 2 or more
years of graduate school).
Need for Assistance.--To control for level of need
for assistance with disabilities, we added two indica-
tors of health status: functional health status and self-
rated health. Functional health was measured by a
count of up to nine ADLs (eating, getting in or out of
bed, getting in or out of chairs, walking, going out-
side, dressing, bathing, and toileting). Although the
sample includes respondents with at feast one ADL or
IADL, we included ADLs and not lADLs as a control
for health because they represent more severe func-
tional limitations. Self-rated health ranged from 1 (poor)
to 4 (excellent).
Availability of Support.--Because availability of po-
tential sources of support is a necessary condition for
receipt of assistance, and offspring represent a primary
source of help in old age, we included number of
adult children (up to 16) as an indicator of support
availability.
Analyses
We used ordinary least squares regression to ex-
amine the effect of marital status on total number of
helpers. Logistic regression was used in the examina-
tion of whether one's helping network contains more
kin than nonkin members. For the third component
698 The Gerontologist
of the analyses, we ran a multivariate regression model.
Sources of care received were regressed on marital
status, Marital Status x Gender interactions, and other
predictors. A multivariate regression model is an ap-
propriate approach because the probability that an
individual received care from one source is likely to
influence whether the individual received care from
another source, hence implying endogeneity.
At least two methods exist by which to model this
endogeneity. First, one could explicitly model the non-
recursive relationship among the endogenous variables
by treating each source of help as a predictor of the
others. However, this approach is not appropriate without
extensive constraints because such a model is under-
identified. An alternative approach is to allow the
errors of each source of help to correlate. Estimating
correlated errors is essentially equivalent to reparam-
eterizing the 12 potential regression coefficients (i.e.,
the effects of each source of help on the others) into
six covariances, yielding a just-identified model. In this
research, we chose the second method.
We conducted multivariate regression by using
weighted least squares (WLS) estimation on a Pearson
correlation matrix of 18 variables (4 endogenous, 14
exogenous) with the corresponding asymptotic co-
variance matrix used as the weights. Given that some
of the variables are ordinal, the preferred approach is
to use WLS estimation on a matrix of polychoric cor-
relations between ordinal variables and polyserial
correlations between ordinal and continuous variables.
However, this approach failed to obtain convergence;
hence, we used an accepted alternative approach of
using WLS estimation on a matrix of Pearson correla-
tions (e.g., Bentler & Newcomb, 1991; Stump, Clark,
Johnson, & Wolinsky, 1997).
We imputed missing data for variables that are miss-
ing in fewer than 5% of the cases (i.e., self-rated health
and education) by using means. For household income,
missing in 19% of sample, we used the predictive mean
method (Landerman, Land, & Pieper, 1997).
Results
Means and standard deviations of variables used in
the analyses are presented in Table 1 for each marital
status. Marital status is significantly related with all in-
dependent and dependent variables. The widowed have
the largest caregiving networks and are more likely
than other groups to receive help from adult children.
Over three fourths of the married reported more kin
than nonkin helpers. Networks containing predomi-
nantly family members were less common among other
marital statuses. Siblings and formal helpers were re-
ported by a higher proportion of the never married
compared with other groups. Approximately one fifth
of the unmarried had helping networks that contain
friends, compared with only 5% of the married.
Differences by marital status and gender in the com-
position of caregiving networks are shown in Table 2.
Among the married, women are significantly more likely
than men to receive assistance from any of the four
sources. The only significant gender difference among
the unmarried is found for the separated/divorced. Sep-
arated or divorced women are more likely than their
male peers to have help from their children.
In the examination of total number of helpers, we
found marital status differences (Table 3). Trie main
effects model reveals that the widowed and never mar-
ried have helping networks that are significantly larger
than those of the married. Size of caregiving network
of separated/divorced elderly people does not differ
from that of married elderly people. Additional analy-
ses revealed a significant difference between groups
of the unmarried: The never married have helping net-
works that are larger than those of the separated/
divorced (see Appendix, Note 1). A larger caregiving

network is associated with being female and older and
with having more children, more functional limitations,
and worse self-rated health. An apparent contradic-
tion is observed with higher income and lower edu-
cation being associated with a larger network (see Ap-
pendix, Note 2). Note that the regression coefficients
indicate the effects of income and education, net of
each other (see Appendix, Note 3). There is no evi-
dence that the effect of marital status on number of
helpers varies for men and women (Model 2).
In contrast to models predicting the number of help-
ers, analyses of the composition of caregiving networks
revealed an interaction between marital status and
gender, as well as a main effect of marital status. In
the model predicting the probability of having more
kin than nonkin helpers (Table 4), we found that all
groups of the unmarried had significantly lower odds
than the married of having a network composed predomi-
nantly of family members. We found significant dif-
ferences among the unmarried. The separated/divorced
had lower odds than both the widowed and the never
married. Results showed that being male and having
more children and fewer ADLs increased the odds of
having a helping network composed primarily of fam-
ily members. As observed for network size, income
and education exerted opposite effects on network
composition. Model 2 reveals that gender and marital
status interacted to influence the composition of care-
giving networks. For both groups of the formerly mar-
ried, women had higher odds than men of having more
kin than nonkin helpers.
In the multivariate regression model presented in
Table 5, we found further evidence of marital status
differences and Marital Status x Gender interactions.
In the main effects model (not shown), it was revealed
that all groups of the unmarried were more likely than
the married to receive help from their adult children.
Receiving assistance from children was associated with
being older, female, and White and having higher in-
come, less education, more children, more functional
limitations, and worse self-rated health. A Marital Sta-
tus x Gender interaction term reached significance,
indicating that never-married women were more likely
than their male peers to have help from their adult
children.
With regard to help from siblings, all groups of the
unmarried were significantly more likely than the married
to have help from siblings. Reporting a sibling as a

helper was related to being younger and having less
education, fewer children, ana worse self-rated health.
In the interactive model shown in Table 5, there was
no evidence that gender moderated the effect of marital
status on help from siblings.
The widowed, separated/divorced, and never mar-
ried were more likely than the married to have friends
in their helping networks. As observed in help from a
son or daughter, income and education operated in
opposite directions; however, in contrast with help from
children, higher education and lower income increased
the likelihood of reporting a friend. Having fewer children
increased the likelihood of help from friends. An in-
teraction term reached significance, revealing that among
the never-married, men are more likely than women
to have friends as helpers.
The never married and both groups of the previ-
ously married were more likely than the married to
have help from formal helpers. Assistance from a for-
mal helper was associated with being older and fe-
male and having fewer children, more functional limi-
tations, and worse self-rated health. We found the same
pattern in the effects of income and education ob-
served for help from a friend in assistance from a for-
mal helper. There was no evidence to suggest that
the effect of marital status on formal help differs for
men and women.
The correlations between the error terms of the sources
of assistance, noted in Table 5, provide evidence of
the extent to which receiving help from one source
was related to help from other sources. Of the six
possible correlations between the errors of each source
of help, most were negative, indicating that receiving
assistance from one source was associated with a lower
likelihood of help from other sources. An exception
was revealed, such that help from a friend and from a
formal source are positively related.
Discussion
The results indicate that the size and composition
of helping networks that assist elderly people with func-
tional limitations vary by marital status. The findings
extend the literature by revealing differences in help-
ing networks across groups of the unmarried and
challenge the treatment of the unmarried as a homo-
geneous group in research on caregiving networks. Further,
the results reveal that the effect of marital status on
network composition varied by gender. Although a few
previous studies have examined multiple marital sta-
tuses (e.g., Chatters et al., 1986; Connidis & McMullin,
1994), they have been limited either by failing to
include a control for health status or to examine po-
tential gender differences or by considering only one
racial group. In addition, prior research considering
several marital statuses has not simultaneously mod-
eled receipt of assistance from several sources.
The most consistent finding was that the networks
of the married, in terms of both size and composi-
tion, differed significantly from nearly all categories of
the unmarried. The only exception is that the net-
works of the separated/divorced did not differ signifi-
cantly in size from those of the married. Among the
married, we found small helping networks consisting
primarily of related individuals. Other analyses con-
ducted in this study and findings reported by other
researchers (e.g., Johnson & Catalano, 1981) revealed
that spouses are, not surprisingly, the central mem-
bers of the helping networks of the married. For ex-
ample, we found that 88% of the married reported
their spouse as a helper. Findings are consistent with
social regression theory, positing an increased reliance
on exchanges within the marital relationship and a
simultaneous withdrawal from other social ties (Slater,
1963).
Vol.39, No. 6, 1999 701
Controlling for level of need for help with func-
tional limitations, the married along with the separated/
divorced had the smallest networks of helpers com-
pared with the widowed and never married. Although
the limited number of helpers assisting the married
can be explained by the process of social regression,
the relatively small size of the helping networks of the
separated/divorced may be related to the unexpected
nature of this type of marital dissolution. Many elderly
people who are separated or divorced may have ex-
pected over most of their adult lives to be cared for
in later life by their spouse. Even if the separation or
divorce was not recent, it is plausible that the smaller
number of helpers assisting these elders reflects the
difficulty of reshaping one's support network, from which
caregivers are drawn, to compensate for the prema-
ture or unexpected loss of one's spouse.
Data on the timing of marital transitions are not
available in NLTCS; however, the findings raise ques-
tions about the effect of marital history on caregiving
networks that could be addressed in future research.
For example, sources of support for the more recently
divorced or widowed may be different from the set
of helpers assisting those who are unmarried over a
longer duration. Losing one's spouse earlier in life, be-
fore the onset of functional limitations, may result in
relatively large helping networks consisting of relatives
and friends with whom exchange relationships have
been developed over a number of years. More recent
marital loss may be associated with smaller helping
networks and increased reliance on formal help.
The results from examinations of the composition
of helping networks suggest that the unmarried have
more diverse caregiving networks than the married.
Our findings provided support for the substitution hy-
pothesis. All groups of the unmarried had lower odds
than the married of having a network composed pri-
marily of family members. Analyses of the presence
of specific helpers in caregiving networks of elderly
people provided further evidence of substitution. The
formerly married were significantly more likely than
the married to receive assistance from adult children.
Help from children was especially common among the
widowed. The never married were more likely than
the currently or formerly married to have siblings as
caregivers. Friends are more likely to be reported as
helpers of the unmarried, especially the widowed, com-
pared with the married. The unmarried were also more
likely to have formal helpers; however, the differences
in receipt of formal help between groups of the un-
married were less striking.
These findings are consistent with substitution, which
would predict that among those without a spouse (e.g,
the widowed), adult children will provide assistance.
And those without children (e.g, the majority of the
never married in current older cohorts) will be helped
by other relatives, such as siblings. Although the re-
sults generally followed the patterns expected by sub-
stitution, they also highlight the inability of substitu-
tion to explain patterns revealed by examining unmar-
ried statuses separately. For example, it is not clear
why help from adult children was significantly more
likely for widows than for the separated/divorced. Con-
trolling for number of children, the results indicate that
widows turn to their children, whereas the separated
or divorced rely on siblings or friends. Perhaps incor-
porating theoretical perspectives drawn from work on
the effect of separation and divorce on family inter-
action and typically focused on earlier life stages with
the gerontological research on diversity in caregiving
networks will illuminate these patterns in sociafsup-
port by marital status.
We found less evidence to support the supplemen-
tation hypothesis, which predicted a positive link be-
tween help from family and receipt of formal care. In
contrast, the findings derived from the error correla-
tions (Table 5) indicated that help from family (chil-
dren or siblings) was associated with decreased likeli-
hood of formal help. However, a positive association
was revealed between help from friends and formal
support. One explanation is that those who were least
able to rely on their family members for care must
turn to both friends and formal helpers, perhaps with
friends providing socioemotional support and formal
helpers assisting with functional limitations. Alternatively,
the finding could reflect a linking mechanism through
which friends serve as referrals or mediators of formal
care. Although NLTCS contains data on the type of
assistance with functional limitations received from specific
helpers, less information is available on socioemotional
support and referrals that may occur between help-
ers. Further research including measures of the level
and type of support from friends is needed to deter-
mine whether the association found here reflects an
underlying process through which assistance from
friends leads to help from formal sources.
In this study, primary attention was given to sources
of support to community-dwelling, disabled elderly
persons. Another aspect of social support, types of
assistance provided, would need to be examined to
adequately test the validity of the task-specificity hy-
pothesis. However, some limited evidence supporting
this model can be drawn from these analyses. Having
adult children, sibling, and formal helpers are all sig-
nificantly associated with one or both health measures,
suggesting that the help provided to disabled elderly
people by these sources is linked to self-rated and func-
tional health. In contrast, help from friends is not re-
lated to health. It is plausible that these results indi-
cate that friends, as suggested by Litwak (1985), con-
stitute a primary group that is suited to perform tasks
that differ from those performed by family or formal
helpers.
This research also illuminates the links among gen-
der, marital status, and caregiving networks. Gender
did not appear to interact with marital status to influ-
ence the size of helping networks. Women, in gen-
eral, had more helpers than men, and this held across
marital statuses. The relationship between marital sta-
tus and gender was more complex in the composition
of caregiving networks. Formerly married women had
higher odds than currently married women of having
predominantly family members in their helping net-
works. However, among men being married, relative
to being formerly married, increased the odds of hav-
ing a helping network composed primarily of family

members. An explanation for this observation is the
heavier reliance on spouses for assistance by men than
women (i.e., 93% of married men in this sample re-
ported their spouse as a helper, but only 80% of mar-
ried women did).
One of the most striking findings related to gender
was the relatively low rate of assistance from adult
children to separated/divorced men relative to women
(shown most clearly in Table 2). This finding is con-
sistent with research revealing that for men divorce
brings a decrease in the frequency of interaction with
children (Bulcroft & Bulcroft, 1991) and suggests that
these patterns in interaction can have consequences
for receipt of caregiving in later life.
Other findings raise questions about the interaction
of unmarried men with their adult children over the
lifecourse. Among the never married, women were
significantly more likely to be helped in later life by
their adult children. It is plausible that this pattern, as
that of separated/divorced men, results from lower levels
of interaction with their children throughout the life-
course, in contrast with widowed or married men. Another
gender difference revealed in the examination of sources
of help is the increased likelihood of friends as help-
ers of never-married men compared with their female
peers. Taken together, these results suggest that never-
married women may maintain relationships with fam-
ily members, including their children, who support them
in later life, whereas single men rely on their friends.
The social patterning of caregiving networks is im-
portant to examine because whom one turns to for
nelp when faced with disabilities has consequences
for well-being in later life. For example, elders who
rely on sources other than a spouse or adult child are
more likely to experience a decline or cessation in
support over time (Stolar et al., 1986). In addition, as
the task-specificity hypothesis brings into focus, avail-
ability and choice of helpers are likely to affect the
type of assistance received. Further analyses that si-
multaneously consider types of support and sources
of assistance across multiple marital statuses will pro-
vide insight into the unmet needs of elderly people.
