Non-technical summary
Research Question
The recent financial crisis has been followed by the implementation of a new regulatory
framework in the financial sector. This includes the introduction of prudential instruments that
target the stability of the financial system as a whole. In integrated banking markets, banks
can respond to changes in prudential regulation in one country by shifting their activities
between countries. This can weaken the effectiveness of national prudential instruments and
create cross-border spillovers. Thus, we ask how prudential policies implemented in domestic
and foreign markets affect German banks' local and global lending behavior.
Contribution
We use detailed micro-level data on banks' international activities including information on
German banks' foreign branches and subsidiaries. We merge this data with a novel cross-
country dataset on prudential measures. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to study
how regulatory changes affect German banks' domestic and international lending decisions.
Our results are used in a cross-country analysis of the International Banking Research
Network (IBRN). Thereby we inform the current policy discussions about cross-border
spillovers of prudential regulation.
Results
We find evidence for cross-border spillovers of prudential regulation. However, the results are
heterogeneous depending on the direction of spillovers, the type of banks and prudential
instruments. For example, we find that German banks increase their domestic loan supply as a
response to stricter regulation in countries in which they maintain international activities. In
contrast, foreign banks located in Germany reduce their loan supply in Germany if regulation
in their home country tightens. This suggests that no general policy conclusions can be drawn
but recommends a case-wise analysis when evaluating cross-border spillovers of prudential
regulation.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Als Antwort auf die letzte Finanzkrise wurden zahlreiche regulatorische Änderungen im
Finanzsystem eingeführt. Diese beinhalten die Implementierung von regulatorischen
Instrumenten, welche die Stabilisierung des gesamten Finanzsystems zum Ziel haben. In
integrierten Finanzmärkten können Banken auf regulatorische Maßnahmen in einem Land
reagieren, indem sie ihr Geschäft in andere Länder verlagern. Dies kann die Effektivität
nationaler regulatorischer Instrumente einschränken und zu grenzüberschreitenden Effekten
führen. Deshalb beschäftigen wir uns mit der Frage, wie regulatorische Maßnahmen im
Heimatland und im Ausland die heimische und internationale Kreditvergabe von deutschen
Banken beeinflussen.
Beitrag
Unsere Analyse basiert auf detaillierten Mikrodaten zu den Auslandsaktivitäten von
deutschen Banken sowie ihrer ausländischen Töchter und Zweigstellen. Diese Daten führen
wir mit einem neuen internationalen Datensatz zu regulatorischen Maßnahmen zusammen.
Auf dieser Basis analysieren wir die Auswirkungen von Regulierungsänderungen auf die
heimische und internationale Kreditvergabe von deutschen Banken. Unsere Ergebnisse
fließen in eine länderübergreifende Studie des International Banking Research Network
(IBRN) ein. So liefern unsere Ergebnisse einen Beitrag zu der aktuellen politischen
Diskussion über grenzüberschreitende Auswirkungen von Regulierung.
Ergebnisse
Die Ergebnisse weisen auf grenzüberschreitende Auswirkungen von Regulierungsänderungen
hin. Die Auswirkungen variieren jedoch in Abhängigkeit von der betrachteten Spezifikation,
den Eigenschaften der Banken und den regulatorischen Instrumenten. Wir zeigen zum
Beispiel, dass deutsche Banken ihr Kreditwachstum in Deutschland erhöhen, wenn im
Ausland die Regulierung strenger wird. Im Gegensatz dazu reduzieren ausländische Banken,
die in Deutschland vertreten sind, ihr Kreditwachstum in Deutschland, wenn die Regulierung
in ihrem Heimatland restriktiver wird. Dies spricht gegen allgemeine Schlussfolgerungen und
für eine fallweise Betrachtung der grenzüberschreitenden Auswirkungen von Regulierung.

Abstract
We analyze the inward and outward transmission of regulatory changes through German banks'
(international) loan portfolio. Overall, our results provide evidence for international spillovers of
prudential instruments, these spillovers are however quite heterogeneous between types of banks and
can only be observed for some instruments. For instance, foreign banks located in Germany reduce
their loan growth to the German economy in response to a tightening of sector-specific capital buffers,
local reserve requirements and loan to value ratios in their home country. Furthermore, from the point
of view of foreign countries, tightening reserve requirements was effective in reducing lending inflows
from German banks. Finally, we find that business and financial cycles matter for lending decisions.

1. Introduction
In response to the recent financial crisis, numerous and substantial changes have been made
to the architecture of the financial system. One key objective is to maintain financial stability
by widening the focus of regulation from individual banks to the stability of the financial
system as a whole. Prudential instruments can help in achieving this objective. The
effectiveness of these instruments for financial stability hinges however on the absence of
unintended leakages and spillovers. In integrated financial markets, such as in the German
case, this might be a challenge given that banks can circumvent prudential regulation by
adapting their global activities.
In this paper, we analyze how prudential policies implemented in domestic and foreign
markets affect German banks' local and global lending behavior. Our study relates to the
current policy debate on cross-border effects of regulatory policies and reciprocation. For
instance, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is the European macroprudential
authority, has recently issued recommendations which call for an annual assessment of cross-
border effects of national macroprudential measures (ESRB 2015). We use detailed micro-
level data on German banks to study regulatory spillovers across borders in three different
dimensions; inward transmission of foreign regulation into Germany due to international
activities of German banks, inward transmission through foreign affiliates located in
Germany, and outward transmission to foreign countries through foreign lending of German
banks and their affiliates.
This analysis is part of the International Banking Research Network (IBRN) project on cross-
border regulatory spillovers and follows the methodology described in Buch and Goldberg
(2016).2 The IBRN is a network of several national central banks (NCBs), the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) which seeks to analyze questions regarding global banks' activities.3
The key advantage of the IBRN is the access to NCBs' high-quality micro-level data
combined with the use of up-to date empirical methods and the availability of expert
knowledge on the characteristics of national banking systems. The IBRN's work thus yields,
first, relevant results from single-country studies based on a common methodology and
performed by the country teams within the network (a list of the other country studies on
2 Following Buch and Goldberg (2016), the term spillovers is used to analyze whether changes in regulation in
one country affect banks' decisions in another country. We do not make explicit statements about regulatory
arbitrage or about the welfare effects of spillovers.

regulatory spillovers can be found at the end of the references section). Second, these
country-specific results can be compared and analyzed in a meta-analysis. For example,
another IBRN project focused on the transmission of liquidity risk through banks'
international exposures; a summary of the results can be found in Buch and Goldberg (2015).
The issue of regulatory spillovers through global banks is analyzed by various country teams;
this study looks at the German perspective. We use the Deutsche Bundesbank's External
Position Report, which gives us detailed micro-level information on German banks'
international activities. Data on changes in prudential policies is obtained from the IBRN.
The newly established database on "IBRN Prudential Instruments Database" includes
information on prudential instruments, e.g. reserve requirements or concentration limits, for
more than 60 countries over the 2000-2014 period (Cerutti et al. 2015). Furthermore, given
that regulatory changes are likely to interact with economic conditions, we control for the
business and financial cycles using data provided by the BIS.
The German case is interesting because of the high degree of international activity of German
banks. We analyze international lending growth of German-owned banks to 52 foreign
countries. These foreign claims amount to 33% of total claims of German banks. Also,
Germany hosts 72 affiliates of foreign banks which hold 9% of all German claims. From a
German policy perspective, it is important to understand whether and how these foreign-
owned banks transmit regulatory changes from their home country into the German market.
Finally, German banks enter foreign markets not only through cross-border lending but also
through both, foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries. Besides following the common
IBRN methodology, our data allow us to test whether foreign branches and subsidiaries
behave differentially to changes in regulation.
While our results provide evidence for international spillovers of prudential instruments, we
document that these spillovers are heterogeneous between types of instruments and types of
banks. First, analyzing the inward transmission of regulatory changes abroad due to foreign
exposures of German banks, we find for the average bank that domestic lending growth
increases if foreign regulation tightens. This holds specifically for a tightening in capital
requirements and loan to value ratios.
Second, foreign-owned affiliates located in Germany contract their lending growth in
Germany in response to a policy tightening in their home country. This finding is surprising
as one might expect that foreign-owned banks respond to stricter regulation in their home
3
country by increasing lending activities of their foreign affiliates that are not subject to the
regulation. However, regulatory pressure can have indirect effects on foreign affiliates
located in Germany if their parent bank draws resources from them in order to fulfill tighter
requirements in the home country. While there is a substantial heterogeneity between
different types of foreign-owned banks, the impact of bank characteristics depends on the
regulatory instrument. Overall, the retrenchment from the German lending market is less
pronounced for larger banks that are better capitalized and with a higher ratio of illiquid
assets to total assets.
Third, for the outward transmission exercise, we find evidence that international lending
growth by German banks is negatively affected by stricter regulation in the destination
country. However, for most prudential instruments we only find short-run effects that vanish
after one quarter. Only in the case of local reserve requirements, we find that a tightening in
this instrument significantly reduces loan growth over a longer time horizon. This suggests
that reserve requirements, which have been used mainly by emerging markets in our sample,
have been successful in controlling capital inflows from German banks.
Furthermore, we study whether foreign branches and subsidiaries of German banks differ in
their responses to changes in the prudential regulation in their host country. Institution-based
regulation in the host country usually applies to foreign subsidiaries, while foreign branches
are subject to home country regulation. These differences in the treatment of branches
compared to subsidiaries in the host country may facilitate regulatory leakages. Our results
suggests that foreign subsidiaries are constrained by host country regulation as they reduce
lending growth after a tightening in the host country prudential index (as well as in sector-
specific capital buffers, loan-to-value-ratios and foreign reserve requirements). Foreign
branches, however, do not change their lending growth significantly after a change in host
country regulation (except for a negative effect of concentration ratios and a positive
contemporaneous effect of the prudential index). In contrast to foreign subsidiaries, marginal
effects of a tightening in prudential instruments are positive in the foreign branch sub-sample,
but they lack significance.
Finally, we find that business and financial cycles matter for lending decisions. For example,
foreign-owned banks located in Germany increase lending growth when the financial cycle in
their home country undergoes an upturn. Similarly, German banks increase lending growth to
destination countries which experience an upturn in the financial and business cycles. This
4
procyclicality to destination country cycles, however, cannot be found for loan growth by
German banks' foreign affiliates that are hosted in these countries.
Our study adds to research on the pattern of German banks' international activities and cross-
border spillovers. Buch et al. (2014), for example, find that more productive German banks
are more likely to maintain cross-border activities. In contrast, the propensity to maintain
cross-border loans decreases with risk aversion (Düwel et al. 2011). Besides productivity and
risk aversion, bank size matters. While a large percentage of German banks are active abroad,
only large banks maintain foreign affiliates (Buch et al. 2011a). We include a set of bank
control variables based on this literature.
The recent financial crisis has affected banks' international activities.4 Banks have withdrawn
from international markets, with one reason being changes in funding conditions or
government interventions (Buch et al. 2013, Kerl and Koch 2015). Internal capital markets
have been one tool to stabilize foreign affiliates' lending activities after the crisis depending
on parent banks' characteristics (Frey and Kerl 2015). Regarding international spillovers,
Buch et al. (2011b) look at the effect of rescue measures implemented in response to the
recent financial crisis in the US and Germany and find evidence of spillover effects through
foreign affiliates.
Our paper sets itself apart from these studies by focusing on the effects of changes in
prudential regulation on German banks' (international) lending activity. We address this issue
by exploiting a novel dataset on regulatory changes obtained from Cerutti et al. (2015),
thereby contributing to a relatively new strand of the literature (e.g. Jiménez et al. 2012,
Aiyar et al. 2014). However, studies that evaluate the use and effectiveness of prudential
instruments are mostly based on country-level data (IMF 2011, Claessens et al. 2013). Cerutti
et al. (2016) study the outcome of a new survey on prudential instruments conducted by the
IMF. They find that these instruments tend to be used more in emerging market economies,
that their use is linked to the state of the credit and housing markets, and, importantly, that
there is evidence for avoidance of these policies by relying more on cross-border borrowing.
Evidence at the micro level is scarce and often limited to domestic markets or single
instruments (Jiménez et al. 2012, Aiyar et al. 2014). Overall, we find a withdrawal from
foreign markets when regulation in the home or foreign market tightens.
4 For studies on the transmission of shocks through international banks, see, for example, Cetorelli and Goldberg
(2011). Bremus and Fratzscher (2015) look at the factors that caused changes in the structure of cross-border
capital flows after the recent crisis.
5
The paper is structured as follows. The following part describes the data and stylized facts
regarding international activities of German banks. The third part presents regression results
for the analysis of inward and outward transmission of prudential instruments. In addition to
the common methodology, we analyze whether adjustments differ for foreign branches and
subsidiaries of German banks. The final part concludes the paper.
2. Data and Stylized Facts for Germany
2.1 Bank-Level Data
We use confidential data collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank for the Monthly Balance
Sheet Statistics of banks (BISTA).5 The sample covers the period from 2002Q1 to 2013Q4.
Data is available for (i) all banks located in Germany, including foreign-owned subsidiaries,
and (ii) German banks' branches and subsidiaries operating abroad. Data on German banks'
international activities by destination country is obtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank's
External Position Report. The analysis is conducted at quarterly frequency in order to match
the frequency of the regulatory dataset. To aggregate monthly data to quarterly frequency, we
use quarter-end values.
Dependent variables
For the dependent variable, we use the change in log loans multiplied by 100. In the baseline
specification, we use total loans; in robustness tests, we exploit the sectoral breakdown and
analyze the effect on loans to banks, non-bank private sector, and the public sector separately.
For the inward transmission exercise, we refer to total domestic loans as provided by the
monthly balance sheet statistics. This data is available for domestic (German) banks and
foreign affiliates located in Germany. 6 For the latter, we can identify the country of the
parent bank. For the outward transmission exercise, we make use of data from the External
Position Report. All German banks, including their foreign affiliates (branches and
subsidiaries), are required to report foreign asset positions, broken down by destination
country. While foreign subsidiaries of German banks have to report their foreign claims
5 For more information on the Deutsche Bundesbank's Monthly Balance Sheet Statistics of banks please see
https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Standardartikel/Service/Reporting_systems/monthly_balance_sh
eet_statistics.html?https=1
6 Please note that foreign affiliates located in Germany are not included in the outward transmission exercise due
to data restrictions. In the inward transmission exercise, these banks are only included when specifically
analyzing inward transmission through foreign banks located in Germany. We can not differentiate between
branches and subsidiaries due to data limitations.
6
individually, foreign branches are aggregated for each German parent bank and host country.
7 Our analysis includes the 52 largest destination countries (in terms of overall claims of the
German banking system) and the 92 largest banks (plus their foreign affiliates) in terms of
foreign assets. In this way, we cover more than 90% of the German banking system's total
foreign loans as of December 2013. Our analysis focuses on the intensive margin, i.e. on
lending growth, not on adjustments along the extensive margin. In order to reduce the cases
of entries into and exits out of foreign markets in our dataset, we exclude small banks and
less relevant destination countries. As a result, 84% of all bank-destination country
combinations exist in at least 75% of all quarters.
Regarding the level of consolidation, we proceed as follows. When studying the lending
responses of German-owned banks, we use consolidated (parent plus foreign branch) data if a
German bank owns foreign affiliates but include also banks that lend directly cross-border
without having a foreign affiliate. This is the case for the inward transmission through
international activities of German banks and the outward transmission exercise. This
consolidation choice accounts for the fact that parents and their foreign branches are often
subject to home country regulation, whereas subsidiaries are subject to host country
regulation. We approximate consolidated exposures at the parent-foreign branch level by
using the unconsolidated positions of the parent and its foreign branches and a proxy for
intrabank flows. This proxy has been used in previous studies with this data (Frey and Kerl
2015). For the inward transmission specification through foreign affiliates located in
Germany, we use unconsolidated data due to data constraints but control for internal capital
market positions.
To account for outliers we drop observations where log changes of lending exceed 100% in
absolute terms. We keep only series for which at least two consecutive observations and at
least eight observations in total are available. Qualitatively, our main regression results are
not affected by the data cleaning. Summary statistics are provided in Table 1.
Balance sheet characteristics
The balance sheet characteristics are taken from the monthly balance sheet statistics
(BISTA). To clean the data, we drop observations for which the ratios described below are
less than zero or greater than 100%.8 The balance sheet variables include the illiquid assets
7 For a comprehensive description of the External Position Report, see Fiorentino et al. (2010).
8 The variable capturing internal capital market positions can also be less than zero; we therefore drop values
that exceed 100% in absolute terms.

ratio, core deposits ratio, capital ratio, net intragroup funding ratio, log of total assets, and
international activities ratio. Detailed information on the construction of these variables can
be found in Appendix Table 1. The balance sheet variables are defined as follows, with
corresponding summary statistics provided in Table 1:
ˇ
percentage of a bank's portfolio of assets that is illiquid ,

percentage of a bank's balance sheet financed with core deposits

liabilities ( ,

ˇ log of total assets ( ,

ˇ percentage of a bank's foreign assets plus foreign liabilities relative to total assets plus

2.2 Data on prudential instruments
To analyze spillovers of regulatory policies, this study draws on the "IBRN Prudential
Instruments Database" developed by Cerutti et al. (2015) which provides quarterly
information on changes in prudential instruments plus a composite index for more than 60
countries over the 2000-2014 period. The prudential variables provide information on
tightening (coded by 1) and loosening (coded by -1) of a specific instrument in the specific
quarter when the change came into effect, and zero otherwise. In this study, we focus on six
out of seven instruments to study spillovers of prudential policies: general capital
requirements, sector-specific capital requirements, loan-to-value ratio limits, reserve
requirements (in local and foreign currency), concentration limits. We exclude interbank
exposures limits from our analysis due to the small number of changes for this instrument in
our sample (see Table 2).
We use this information in our analysis to control for individual changes in prudential
instruments in the home country of foreign banks located in Germany and in the destination
country of lending by German banks. We are not analyzing the effects of regulatory changes
in Germany on bank lending because we do not observe enough changes in regulatory
instruments in Germany over the sample period. Instead, we control for German regulation
8
through time fixed effects. See Buch and Goldberg (2016) for more details on the
construction of regulatory measures. The variables are defined as follows:
Regulation weighted by foreign exposures (= all exposures of the banks outside the home
country)
ExpP ,
(where l = 0, 1, 2) = Foreign exposure-weighted regulation
Home country regulation (home country = country of the foreign parent bank)
HomeP,
(where l = 0, 1, 2) = Home country regulation with 0, 1, and 2 lags
Destination country regulation (destination country = country to which the loan goes)
DestP,
(where l = 0, 1, 2) = Destination country regulation with 0, 1, and 2 lags
Table 2 provides summary statistics for changes in these instruments. We see that most
changes occur for reserve requirements on local and foreign currency deposits followed by
capital requirements. A tightening of standards occurred more often than a loosening.
Our sample is rather dominated by advanced economies (60% of the underlying observations
in the Inward A and Outward specification, 90% of the underlying observations in the Inward
B specification). However, we observe relatively more regulatory changes in emerging
market economies for the regulatory instruments that are significant in the regression
analysis. This holds particularly true for foreign and local reserve requirements.
2.3 Data on the business and financial cycles
The second database focuses on macroeconomic conditions and was provided by the BIS. It
allows us to control for the current state of the business (output gap) and financial (credit-to-
GDP gap) cycles when assessing regulatory spillovers (BIS 2014, Drehmann et al. 2011).
This is important given that changes in regulation often take place in response to economic
and financial conditions while their implementation might, in turn, affect economic
outcomes. For example, Cerutti et al. (2016) analyze a new IMF database on prudential
policies for a sample of 119 countries over the 2000-2013 period and establish that the use of
these policies is linked to developments in credit and housing markets.
2.4 Stylized facts
[Fact 1: The degree of internationalization is heterogeneous across German banks.]
A large percentage of German banks maintain international activities (Buch et al. 2011a).
Figure 1 shows that German banks have recently increased their foreign loan supply relative
9
to assets (lower left panel), whereas this cannot be observed for domestic lending (upper right
panel). On average, German banks are net lenders regarding their intragroup positions (lower
right panel). Hence, on average, they distribute liquidity to their foreign subsidiaries rather
than absorbing liquidity from them.
The size of international activities of German banks and thus presumably their potential to
generate cross-border spillovers of regulation varies with the banks' business models:
notably, large German banks conduct a relatively high amount of their business abroad
(Fiorentino et al. 2010). Table 3 shows correlations of banks' total, domestic, and foreign
loan shares with balance sheet characteristics. Besides the relevance of bank size, it can be
seen that German banks' capital and core deposits ratios correlate positively with the share of
domestic loans to assets, whereas this finding is less pronounced or even reversed for the
share of foreign loans to assets. We will therefore test whether banks' balance sheet
characteristics affect their responses to regulatory changes abroad and at home (Section 3.1).
Heterogeneity in international activities also comes into play if we look at foreign loans by
bank group relative to total foreign lending by German banks. For example, in 2013Q4,
around 60% of foreign loans granted by German banks can be attributed to the "large
commercial banks", around 20% to the "head institutes of savings banks and credit unions",
but only 6% to "other commercial banks" and less than 1% to "savings banks and credit
unions" (Table 4). The average bank size in the latter two banking groups is significantly
smaller compared to the former two banking groups, such that the result is consistent with the
relevance of bank size for the conduct of international activities (Table 5). Furthermore,
comparing large commercial banks and head institutes of savings banks and credit unions to
banks in the other banking groups reveals that they have, on average, a lower capital ratio and
illiquid assets ratio, they are net lenders regarding their intragroup positions and financed to a
lower degree by core deposits. These differences in exposure to foreign activities as well as
business models might thus impact the transmission of prudential changes.
[Fact 2: (Inter)national activities of German banks include loans to different sectors.]
Heterogeneity also exists regarding the sectoral breakdown of lending. For example, German
banks' domestic loan supply comprises 56 percent of total assets: 14 percent directed to
banks, 37 percent to the non-bank private sector (i.e. non-financial firms and households),
and 5 percent to the public sector (Table 6). If changes in prudential regulation occur, banks'
responses might vary depending on the loan type. We analyze this issue further in robustness
10
tests (Section 3.1). Also, the sectoral composition of loans differs between types of German
banks' foreign affiliates. A relatively high share of local (=foreign) lending by foreign
branches is directed toward the non-bank private sector. In contrast, foreign subsidiaries have
similar shares of local lending exposures to banks and the non-bank private sector. Both
foreign branches and subsidiaries maintain a relatively high share of home country
(=domestic) loans to banks, most likely reflecting internal capital market activities.
[Fact 3: Foreign affiliates of German banks include both branches and subsidiaries.]
German banks maintain both foreign subsidiaries and foreign branches in a large number of
different counterparty countries. In an extended analysis on the impact of the organizational
structure, we cover around 40 destination countries with approximately 170 subsidiaries and
190 aggregates of branches. 9 Foreign subsidiaries are assumed to respond differently to host
country regulation than foreign branches. For example, German banks' foreign branches,
which are under home country regulation, can expand/reduce their activities compared to
domestic banks in the host country if the latter face a tighter/looser regulatory environment.
In Section 3.2, we thus analyze whether foreign branches respond differently to a tightening
or loosening of host country policies compared to foreign subsidiaries of German banks.
3. Empirical Method and Regression Results
This section presents the baseline estimations for inward and outward transmission of
prudential instruments (Section 3.1). We extend our analysis and ask whether banks adjust
their lending growth differently depending on their organizational form (Section 3.2).
3.1 Baseline analysis of inward and outward transmission of prudential policies
In the following, we provide a description of the baseline empirical model to study inward
and outward transmission and comment on the results. The analysis closely follows the
approach described in Buch and Goldberg (2016).
In each specification 1 to 3, we include our variable of interest, a prudential policy change,
both contemporaneously as well as its two lags. Furthermore, the prudential policy is
interacted with banks' balance sheet characteristics showing how banks with different
9 Note that, as described in the data section, we do not have data on individual branches but the aggregate of
branches per German parent bank and host country. For example, if the German parent bank A has two branches
in the US, we have information on the sum of these two branches.
11
(structural) balance sheet characteristics adjust their loan growth in response to changes in
regulation. In regression tables 7 to 14, for the sake of brevity, the reported coefficients are
the sum of the contemporaneous term and its two lags, with the corresponding p-value of the
F-statistics for joint significance in square brackets.
As the prudential instrument enters individually as well as in the interaction effects with bank
variables, we calculate a marginal effect (at the average) for both, the contemporaneous
changes as well as for the sum of contemporaneous and lagged changes. These marginal
effects give the effects of regulation for the average bank and are reported at the bottom of
each table. Baseline regression models include time and bank fixed effects.

is a vector of
control variables that captures the degree to which a bank is exposed to changes in regulation
through ex ante balance sheet composition as described in Section 2.1. The prudential policy
changes are captured by ExpP, that is an index of exposure-weighted prudential policies
outside the home country. We control for time-invariant heterogeneity at the bank level by
including bank fixed effects fb
. Time fixed effects ft
capture global developments that affect
all banks contemporaneously.
The interaction terms of the prudential instrument with banks' balance sheet characteristics
shows how banks with different (structural) balance sheet characteristics adjust their loan
growth in response to changes in regulation. As the baseline regression model includes time
and bank fixed effects, the coefficient of the interaction term measures how the structure of
banks' balance sheets affects the response of bank lending to changes in regulation.
This approach helps for identification in two dimensions. First, we estimate lending responses
at the bank-level with respect to a change in regulatory policies at the country-level.
Assuming that an individual bank does not drive adjustments in regulatory policies, this
reduces endogeneity concerns. Second, we interact changes in regulatory policies with
balance sheet characteristics. Like this, we can account for the fact that banks' reactions to
regulatory policy can be heterogeneous depending on their business model. For example,
12
banks' internationalization pattern as well as liquidity and capital buffers might determine to
which extent a bank is affected by changes in regulatory instruments. 10
Results for specification 1 are shown in Table 7; we see that the exposure-weighted index of
changes in the overall prudential index increases domestic lending growth for the average
bank (see marginal effects at the bottom of Table 7). While this effect is significant
contemporaneously, it becomes insignificant in the medium run, if we add the effects for the
first and second lag to a joint effect. One reason for the lack of medium-run effects can be
that most of the changes in instruments are clustered in 2012 and 2013. The result on the
prudential index is driven by two instruments, capital requirements and loan to value ratios.
For the latter, we also see a significant effect for the average bank over current and two lags.
Also in quantitative terms, the current effect of the loan to value ratio is strongest: Given a
tightening of the policy, loan growth rates increase on average by 15.2% which corresponds
to an increase of the median loan growth rate (0.27% per quarter) by 0.04 percentage points
in that quarter. Loan to value ratios have been used actively by emerging market economies
over our sample period and have been both tightened and loosened. This provides a solid
ground for the empirical analysis.
Differences in bank characteristics do not seem to consistently affect the response to
regulatory changes abroad. The positive effect in case of the prudential index is weakened for
banks with higher net intragroup positions; banks' response to a tightening in the instrument
is more than four times weaker if the net intragroup funding ratio increases by one standard
deviation. This might be because foreign affiliates have less scope to provide intragroup
funding to the German parent bank given tighter regulation.

is the same as above. The prudential policy changes are captured by HomeP,
reflecting prudential policy in the home country, that is the country of the parent bank of the
foreign-owned affiliate located in Germany. Z ,
represents the cycle variables for home
country j.
Results on specification (2) are shown in Table 8. For the average foreign bank (see marginal
effects at the bottom of the table), home country policy is of importance for sector-specific
capital buffers, loan to value ratios and reserve requirements on local currency deposits. The
latter two instruments have been used mainly by emerging market countries in our sample.
An increase in these instruments reduces the host (i.e. German) lending growth by foreign
affiliates located in Germany. The economic magnitude of the current effect is strongest for
sector-specific capital buffers: Given a tightening of the policy, on average loan growth rates
decrease by 17.4% which corresponds to a decrease in the median loan growth rate (1.43%
per quarter) by 0.25 percentage points.
This decrease in loan growth can be caused by foreign parents drawing on resources of their
foreign affiliates to fulfill higher reserve or capital requirements and to maintain lending at
home. The effect is, for example, less pronounced for illiquid banks which might have less
scope to transfer liquidity to their parent bank. Also larger and better-capitalized banks are
affected less severely, possibly due to higher buffers which allow them to maintain lending
growth. Two conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, especially reductions in
lending growth in response to activity based measures like loan to value ratios might be
problematic from the perspective of the German regulator in case domestic and foreign
financial cycles do not coincide. Second, a foreign affiliate located in Germany is not
independent from home country regulation, in particular tighter regulation in its parent bank's
country does not make it more attractive to increase lending growth in Germany.12
Regarding the financial and business cycle, we find that an upswing in the financial cycle of
the home country has positive effects on lending growth of foreign affiliates located in
Germany. In sum, this suggests that foreign affiliates are not independent of developments in
to do so. However, regulatory changes in the home country might be important for both types of foreign
affiliates due to the internal capital market and the influence of the parent bank.
12 Interestingly, a tightening in concentration ratios in the home market has the opposite effect, namely an
increase in lending growth to the host (i.e. German) market. With tighter concentration ratios, banks might seek
to increase diversification across regions. However, changes in this instrument go back to only two countries
(the Netherlands and France) such that these results should be taken with care.

the country in which their parent bank is located. Regulatory changes and macroeconomic
developments alike are mirrored in their lending activities within the host country.

Where Y , ,
is the log change in the lending of a German bank b to a foreign country j at
time t. The prudential policy changes are captured by DestP, reflecting prudential changes in
the destination country j of the loan by bank b. All other variables are defined in parallel to
specifications (2) and (3). Again we interpret the effect of the regulatory index by computing
its marginal effect for the average bank.
Results in Table 9 reveal that a tightening in the prudential index of the destination country
reduces lending growth of the average German bank to this country. Hence, stricter policies
in the destination country spill over to German banks even though these are not always
directly subject to the change in regulation. The significant result for the prudential index is
driven in particular by changes in reserve requirements. For local reserve requirements, banks
do not only react in the short-run as can be observed for the prudential index, the
concentration ratio or foreign reserve requirements. Also, the cumulated effect over the
current and following two quarters is negative and significant. Our results thus suggest that
reserve requirements which have been used mostly by emerging countries, have indeed been
successful in dampening lending inflows. 13 A tightening of local reserve requirements relates
on average to a short-run decline in loan growth rates by 0.41 percentage points. The negative
effect is smaller for banks with more liquid assets, possibly because holding the required
reserves may be less costly for these banks, but reinforced for banks that obtain higher net
intragroup funding.
Finally, macroeconomic developments in the destination country matter for German banks'
international loan portfolio. An upturn in the business and financial cycles causes a positive
response in loan growth. This suggests that German banks expand across borders during
economic and financial upswings in the respective destination country.
13 An increase in reserve requirements imposes additional costs on funding, which might in turn be passed on to
borrowers by increasing loan rates and hence dampening credit growth. To simultaneously reduce the country's
attractiveness for foreign capital inflows, an increase in reserve requirements can be accompanied by expansive
monetary policy, which translates into lower returns for foreign investors.
15
Robustness tests
We test the robustness of our results by exploiting the granularity of our data and conducting
regressions in which the dependent variable is broken down by loans to banks, the the non-
bank private sector, and the public sector. The sector breakdown shows that responses to
prudential measures vary across loan sectors and specifications which might explain why we
observe only few significant results for total loan growth. For inward transmission through
foreign exposures, our results are strongest for lending growth to banks and less pronounced
to the non-bank private sector (Tables 10-11). For outward transmission, the negative effect
of a tightening in local-currency reserve requirements on German banks' total international
lending is confirmed contemporaneously and in the medium run for loan growth towards the
non-bank sector, as well as in the short-run towards the bank sector (Tables 12-13). 14
We further test the robustness of our results to excluding small exposures of a bank to a
foreign country as this might reflect idiosyncratic business outside the scope of our model.
Results remain robust if we exclude the 1% or 5% smallest destination country-bank
positions. Finally, we alternate the set of fixed effects, for instance by including country-time
fixed effects controlling for demand factors, and the clustering of the standard errors which
does not cause major changes to our results. 15
3.2 Exploration of organizational structure
This section explores whether foreign affiliates differ in their lending behavior in response to
prudential instruments due to their organizational form. We focus on outward transmission
and distinguish between lending by foreign subsidiaries and by foreign branches of German
banks. This reduces our sample size relative to Table 9 as we exclude all banks that do not
own foreign affiliates but only lend cross-border. Foreign branches and subsidiaries might be
affected differently by changes in prudential instruments in the home and the host country
(Danisewicz et al. 2015). For institution-based instruments, such as capital requirements or
concentration limits, branches tend to be subject to home country regulation whereas
subsidiaries have to comply with host country regulation. We use this variation across bank
and instrument types to analyze banks' differential responses.
14 For brevity, results for loans to the public sector are not reported but can be obtained upon request.
15 These tables are available upon request.
16
Our approach is similar to specification (3) but the sample pools across foreign branches and
foreign subsidiaries of German banks. We allow for heterogeneous effects of cycle variables,
of regulation and of the interaction of regulation with bank variables by interacting them with
an indicator variable that equals one in case of a foreign subsidiary. At the bottom of Table
14, we report the marginal effects of the prudential instruments for branches and subsidiaries,
where the latter consists of the joint effect of the baseline category (=branch) plus the
interaction effect.
We find that the average foreign subsidiary reduces lending growth contemporaneously
following a tightening in the prudential index, sector-specific capital buffers and loan to value
ratios. A tightening in foreign reserve requirements leads to a reduction in lending growth of
foreign subsidiaries in the medium run. While foreign subsidiaries are thus constrained by
host country regulation, we only find weaker evidence for foreign branches. A tightening in
concentration ratios leads to a reduction in lending growth in the short run, while a tightening
in the prudential index leads to an increase in lending growth in the medium run (finding
significant at 10% level only). Bank characteristics other than the organizational structure
seem to play a less important role in the response of foreign affiliates to regulatory changes.
Overall, we find that foreign subsidiaries react more strongly to host country regulation.
Foreign branches do not generate regulatory leakages by increasing lending growth after a
tightening in host country regulation.
4. Concluding Remarks
Global banks may generate cross-border spillovers of the regulatory stance if they adjust their
international loan portfolio in response to foreign and domestic regulation. While prudential
instruments like reserve requirements or loan to value ratios have mostly been implemented
by emerging market countries, in recent times also advanced countries increase their
macroprudential toolkit to target financial stability. For countries like Germany with a highly
internationalized banking system, concerns about regulatory spillovers are a topic of utmost
importance. Therefore policy discussions and coordination are conducted at the European
level at the ESRB. This macroprudential body has recently recommended monitoring cross-
border effects of macroprudential instruments on an annual basis (ESRB 2015). Our study
may inform this current policy debate by analyzing the inward and outward transmission of
regulation for German banks.
17
Overall, while we find evidence for cross-border spillovers of regulation, there is no general
conclusion that holds for all types of policy instruments and banks. Instead, heterogeneity
between banks, loan types and specification matters.
Foreign regulatory changes spill over to lending growth in Germany through both, foreign-
owned banks located in Germany as well as German-owned banks which maintain
international activities. Foreign-owned banks located in Germany reduce their local loan
growth following a tightening of sector-specific capital buffers, local reserve requirements
and loan to value ratios in their parent bank's country. This finding suggests that regulatory
pressure can have indirect effects on foreign affiliates located in Germany if their parent bank
draws resources from them in order to fulfill tighter requirements in the home country.
German-owned banks also transmit changes in foreign countries' regulatory stance to
German borrowers. A tightening of foreign regulation leads to an increase in domestic
lending growth.
Furthermore, we find that German banks reduce foreign lending growth given a tightening in
prudential instruments in the destination country. However, these negative responses abate
rather quickly, except for local reserve requirements. Thus, our results suggest that reserve
requirements have been effective in dampening lending inflows by German banks into
foreign economies.
Finally, transmission occurs not only because of regulatory changes but also because of
economic developments. This is reflected by the fact that business and financial cycles matter
for lending decisions: foreign subsidiaries located in Germany increase lending growth in the
host country in response to an upturn in the financial cycle of their home country. Also,
German banks' international lending behavior is procyclical in the sense that loan growth
increases in response to an upturn in the financial and business cycles of the destination
country.

Data Description
To analyze the effect of changes in prudential instruments on banks' international activities, we
use three main data sources. First, bank-specific data is obtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank.
Second, information on prudential instruments come from the "IBRN Prudential Instruments
Database" introduced in Cerutti et al. (2015). Variables on the business and financial cycle are
provided by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
External position report
Since 2003, all German banks have been required to report their foreign assets and liabilities (in
thousands of euro) on a monthly basis and broken down by sector, destination country, and asset
class. Foreign subsidiaries of German banks provide a report on their external positions by entity
whereas foreign branches of German banks located in the same host country provide a joint
report. A detailed description of the reporting can be found in Fiorentino et al. (2010). Table 1 in
the Appendix provides information on the variables used in this paper.
Macroeconomic variables
Prudential instruments: Data is obtained from Cerutti et al. (2015) and available for more than
60 countries over the period 2000-2014. The instruments in the database include sector-specific
capital requirements (i.e. real state credit, consumer credit, and other), countercyclical capital
buffers, interbank exposure limits, concentration limits, loan-to-value ratio limits, general capital
requirements, and reserve requirements. A tightening is coded by 1, a loosening by -1, and zero
otherwise.
Business cycle: The state of the business cycle is approximated by the output gap (BIS 2014).
Financial cycle: The state of the financial cycle is estimated by the credit-to-GDP gap (BIS
2014).

Table 1: Summary Statistics on Bank Characteristics and Loan Growth
This table provides summary statistics for bank balance sheet and lending data for the inward and outward transmission data set.
For Inward A and B we report log changes of domestic loans, i.e. to Germany, on an aggregate basis as well as split by
counterparty sector. For Outward transmission, we report log changes of loans in each destination country, again on an aggregate
basis as well as split by counterparty sector. Data is observed quarterly from 2002Q1-2013Q4. Banking data comes from the
monthly balance sheet statistics and the External Position Report of the Deutsche Bundesbank and is reported at the group level
(inward A and outward sample) as well as at the level of the individual bank (inward B sample). The net intragroup funding
variable measures, from the perspective of a bank's head office, total net internal borrowing vis-ŕ-vis all its related domestic and

Table 2: Summary Statistics on Changes in Prudential Instruments
This table shows summary statistics on changes in prudential instruments for banks located in Germany over the 2002-2013
period. Data on the eight instruments comes from the "Prudential Instruments Database" developed by Cerutti et al. (2015) and is
on the quarter level. The number of changes in prudential instruments is reported on several dimensions, i.e. on the country-time
level and on the bank-time level. The last column of each table shows the ratio of prudential changes to total observations (i.e. the
share of nonzero observations). The column "Exposure weighted observations" is based on the underlying data on prudential
changes in foreign countries (columns "base data"). The reported data is based on the regression sample. "na" indicates that no
data was available for this instrument. Source: IBRN.

Table 6: Domestic and Foreign Loan Shares and Sectoral Breakdown
This table provides summary statistics for lending data. Data is observed quarterly from 2002Q1-2013Q4. Banking data comes
from the Deutsche Bundesbank's monthly balance sheet statistics and is reported at the (consolidated) group level (inward A
sample). For German banks' foreign branches, data is not reported by individual branch but aggregated by destination country
and parent bank. For foreign subsidiaries, data is reported at the level of the individual subsidiary. Descriptive statistics are
shown for banks' loan-to-asset ratios (in %) and the breakdown into domestic versus foreign loans to assets (in %) as well as the
sectoral split differentiating between loans to banks, to non-bank private sector and to the public sector.

Table 7: Inward Transmission of Policy Through Domestic Banks' International
Exposures
This table reports the effects of changes in regulation and bank characteristics and their interactions on log changes in total loans.
The data is quarterly from 2002Q1 to 2013Q4 for a panel of domestic bank holding companies whereas we use consolidated data.
Foreign-exposure-weighted regulation ExpP is calculated as the weighted average of changes in foreign regulation where the
weights are the total assets and liabilities of the bank in the respective foreign country. For ExpP and its interaction effects, the
reported coefficient is the sum of the contemporaneous term and two lags, with the corresponding p-value of the F-statistic for
joint significance reported below. For more details on the variables see Appendix, Table 1. Each column gives the result for the
regulatory measure specified in the column headline. All specifications include fixed effects as specified in the lower part of the
table. Standard errors are clustered by bank. P-values are reported in square brackets. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 10: Inward Transmission of Policy Through Domestic Banks' International
Exposures ­ Loans to Banks
This table reports the effects of changes in regulation and bank characteristics and their interactions on log changes in loans to
banks. The data is quarterly from 2002Q1 to 2013Q4 for a panel of domestic bank holding companies whereas we use
consolidated data. Foreign-exposure-weighted regulation ExpP is calculated as the weighted average of changes in foreign
regulation where the weights are the total assets and liabilities of the bank in the respective foreign country. For ExpP and its
interaction effects, the reported coefficient is the sum of the contemporaneous term and two lags, with the corresponding p-value
of the F-statistic for joint significance reported below. For more details on the variables see Appendix, Table 1. Each column
gives the result for the regulatory measure specified in the column headline. All specifications include fixed effects as specified
in the lower part of the table. Standard errors are clustered by bank. P-values are reported in square brackets. ***, **, and *
indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 13: Outward Transmission of Policy­ Loans to The Non-bank Private Sector
This table reports the effects of changes in destination country regulation and bank characteristics on log changes in loans to the
Non-bank Private Sector by destination country. The data is quarterly from 2002Q1 to 2013Q4 for a panel of bank holding
companies whereas we use consolidated data. DestP refers to the changes in regulation in the destination country of the loan. For
the marginal effect of DestP as well as DestP interaction effects, the reported coefficient is the sum of the contemporaneous term
and two lags, with the corresponding p-value of the F-statistic for joint significance reported below. For more details on the
variables see Appendix, Table 1. Each column gives the result for the regulatory measure specified in the column headline. All
specifications include fixed effects as specified in the lower part of the table. Standard errors are clustered by destination country.
P-values are reported in square brackets. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 14: Outward Transmission of Policy to Destination Country ­ Foreign Branches vs.
Subsidiaries
This table reports the effects of changes in host country regulation and bank characteristics on log changes in local lending of
German banks' foreign branches and subsidiaries. The data is quarterly from 2002Q1 to 2013Q4 for a panel of foreign affiliates
of German banks. Branch-level data is aggregated across all branches of one parent bank per destination country. Coefficients
referring to subsidiaries show the total effect by aggregating the coefficients of the baseline category (Branches) and the
subsidiary specific interaction effect and reporting their joint significance. DestP refers to the changes in regulation in the
destination country of the loan, which is the host country in this specification. For the marginal effect of DestP as well as DestP
interaction effects, the reported coefficient is the sum of the contemporaneous term and two lags, with the corresponding p-value
of the F-statistic for joint significance reported below. For more details on the variables see Appendix, Table 1. Each column
gives the result for the regulatory measure specified in the column headline. All specifications include fixed effects as specified
in the lower part of the table. Bank explanatory variables, cycle variables, prudential instruments are included in the regressions
but not reported. Standard errors are clustered at the host country level. P-values are reported in square brackets. ***, **, and *
indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Figure 1: Domestic and Foreign Lending Activities of German Banks
This figure shows the evolution of German banks' loan supply. Data is observed quarterly from 2002Q1-2013Q4. The figure
shows unweighted averages across the sample of German bank holding companies. Banking data comes from the monthly
balance sheet statistics of the Deutsche Bundesbank and is reported at the group level of the individual bank. Descriptive
statistics are shown for banks' loan-to-asset ratios (in %), the breakdown into domestic versus foreign loans to assets (in %) as
well as the net intragroup funding (net due) variable that measures, from the perspective of a bank's headquarters, total net
internal borrowing, that is liabilities minus claims of the parent bank vis-ŕ-vis all foreign affiliates of the parent bank relative to
total liabilities (in %).
