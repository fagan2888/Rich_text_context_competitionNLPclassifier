Objectives. The goal of the analysis was to examine the association between health status and work behavior among men
aged 55-69. We specifically examined the conditions under which health is most strongly associated with labor force exit
and reentry.
Methods. The association between health and labor force transitions was examined using logistic regression analyses, based
on data from the 1984 and 1985 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation.
Results. We found that for men aged 55-69 in the mid-1980s, poor health was positively associated with labor force exit,
and negatively associated with returns to work. Although these main effects are very strong, we found that health was particu-
larly important among individuals for whom retirement was least attractive. Health had its most substantial association with
work transitions among men with working wives, as well as among men who were younger, or who had limited nonwork fi-
nancial resources. Health also had a particularly strong association with work transitions among Black men, but only with refer-
ence to reentry decisions.
Discussion. Our results suggest that continued work may have limited appeal for men who are prepared for retirement, even
when they are in excellent health.
POOR health is often highlighted as an important considera-
tion in the decision to leave the labor force (e.g., Hardy,
1982; Morgan, 1981; Sammartino, 1987; Smith, 1985), and
several studies suggest that disability-related exits occur fre-
quently as well (Hayward, Friedman, & Chen, 1996; Hayward
& Grady, 1990; Hayward, Hardy, & Grady, 1989). This litera-
ture clearly establishes that poor health serves as a barrier to ac-
tive labor force participation, and suggests that good health is
both a prerequisite for and a motivating force in continued work
activity. However, those characteristics and resources that may
alter the association between health and labor force decisions--
such as features of family life or socioeconomic well-being--
have not been systematically examined. The purpose of this
study was to examine the complex association between health
and work transitions among older men, focusing on both labor
force exit and reentry. This research extends and refines our un-
derstanding of late-life work behavior by showing that the asso-
ciation between health and labor force transitions is conditioned
by important personal characteristics. For many men--those
who are older, who have nonworking wives or are unmarried,
and those with adequate nonwork incomes--the correspondence
between health status and labor force transitions is very limited.
Work Life and Health Status
Researchers agree that poor health often leads to an exit from
the paid labor force (see discussions in Bazzoli, 1985;
Sammartino, 1987; Wolfe, 1985). For example, Anderson,
Burkhauser, and Quinn (1986) find that older men who experi-
ence a decline in health retire at a younger age than expected.
Recent evidence from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
also has shown that health status plays an important role in the
early withdrawal of older workers from the labor force (Bound,
Schoenbaum, & Waidmann, 1995). The intrinsic relationship
between work and health has led some researchers to treat them
as jointly determined, or to examine retirement and disability
as alternative pathways out of the labor force (Anderson &
Burkhauser, 1985; Chirikos & Nestel, 1985; Hayward et al.,
1996; Hayward & Grady, 1990; Hayward et al., 1989).
At any given time, both health status and work status are em-
bedded within a series of interlocking transitions. Work status is
affected not only by features of one's earlier work career, but also
by features of one's "health career" such as the onset and pro-
gression of a disabling condition (Smith, 1985). All else equal, in-
dividuals who are in poor health are motivated to leave the labor
force, and their healthy counterparts are motivated to stay. In ad-
dition, reentry and partial retirement occur among a share of those
retiring, but it is often of short duration (Ruhm, 1990). However,
once a person is in a nonworking status, poor health acts as a bar-
rier to labor force reentry, while good health facilitates it
(Morrow-Howell & Leon, 1988; Peracchi & Welch, 1994).
The variable effects ofpoor health on work status.--Given
the barriers to work experienced by many individuals in poor
health, we anticipate a strong association between health status
and work transitions. We expect that older working men in poor
health are more likely to exit the labor force, and older non-
working men in poor health are less likely to reenter, than are
their more healthy counterparts. Yet, health status is embedded
within a matrix of other influences shaping work behavior, in-
cluding the normative acceptability and the affordability of not
working, policy-based work disincentives, and factors motivat-
ing the desire for a retirement lifestyle. We anticipate that these
S252
WORK TRANSITIONSAND HEALTH S253
influences will condition the extent to which health and work
transitions are associated with one another. Even those in good
or excellent health may be drawn to nonwork, especially if
other supports are present. To our knowledge, the ways in
which health and other work-related characteristics influence
work transitions have not been systematically examined in pre-
vious studies. We expect that the marginal influence of health
will be most pronounced for those otherwise lacking strong
motivation to retire.
Among men with limited nonwork income, relatively young
men, and men with a working spouse, the motivation to con-
tinue working is great. All else equal, men who have nonwork
incomes through pension or other forms of wealth are attracted
to the retirement status. The nonworker role is particularly ap-
pealing to potential pension recipients; indeed, the work disin-
centive features of Social Security and many private pension
plans are well documented (Quinn & Burkhauser, 1994; Wise,
1997). In contrast, those lacking pension eligibility must choose
between continued wage work and low retirement incomes,
which may be supplemented by disability benefits in some
cases. The pull to retirement becomes stronger as men age, both
through normative pressures and through age-graded work dis-
incentives. As reflected by the long-term decline in labor force
participation of men in industrialized countries world-wide
(Quinn & Burkhauser, 1994), aging men have increasingly ex-
perienced a pull toward retirement that makes nonwork a nor-
mative status, even among those in good health. In addition, lit-
erature on the coordination of retirement decisions between
spouses suggests that older men who have nonworking spouses,
as well as those who are not married, may be more open to the
possibility of retirement (Henretta & O'Rand, 1983; Henretta,
O'Rand, & Chan, 1993; O'Rand, Henretta, & Krecker, 1992;
Szinovacz, 1989). However, men with working wives also have
an alternative source of income that may generate an income
substitution effect should labor force exit be desirable.
Poor health may override other motivations to work, yet
good health is expected to amplify these motivations, leading to
particularly high probabilities of remaining in the workforce, or
to reentering the workforce if exit has already occurred. As a
result, men who have limited nonwork incomes, who are
younger, or who have working wives may be motivated to pur-
sue a work attachment as long as health does not become so
poor as to intervene.
Although the interaction of health with other characteristics
shaping late-life work behavior has not been systematically ad-
dressed in the literature, some empirical evidence suggests that
health has a stronger effect on retirement for some groups than
for others. For example, Sammartino (1987) reviews evidence
suggesting that the chances a man in poor health actually retires
likely depends on affordability as well as age, while Burr,
Massagli, Mutchler, and Pienta (1996) note differences between
Black and White men in the effects of health on work behavior
(see also Bound et al., 1995; Bound, Schoenbaum, &
Waidmann, 1996).
Additional evidence suggesting that health may vary in its
influence on work is provided by Henretta, Chan, and O'Rand
(1992), who examined self-defined responses to work limita-
tions, using data from the Social Security Administration's New
Beneficiary Survey. They found that poor health is a significant
predictor of several reported reasons for retirement that are not
actually health-based. Thus, many individuals who reported re-
tiring because they wanted to, could afford it, or for some other
primary reason, were also in relatively poor health (although,
according to these reports, health was not the factor prompting
the retirement). Moreover, among those reporting poor health
as the primary reason for retirement, many gave additional jus-
tification such as wanting to retire, or other reasons; this again
suggests that for some, health alone may be an insufficient basis
of action. Although the goal of the Henretta and associates
study (1992) was to examine reported reasons for retirement
rather than the decision to exit or reenter the labor force, their
results suggest that a cluster of characteristics--often including
health in combination with other precipitating factors--may
drive labor force decisions. Applied to our study, these results
suggest that the association between work transitions and health
may be shaped not only by the degree of disability, but also by
health status interacting with other characteristics of the older
individual that shape motivation for work transitions.
Preparation for retirement.--Other studies (e.g., Ekerdt,
Vinick, & Bosse, 1989) suggest that work behavior may be
shaped by level of preparation for retirement. An individual
who has planned for or is otherwise open to nonwork would be
more likely to exit the workforce and remain nonworking.
Because other factors draw them to retirement, in these cases
health status may be a secondary concern when making choices
about work. In contrast, Ruhm (1990) suggests that individuals
who make decisions regarding labor supply under conditions of
"considerable uncertainty" experience higher rates of reentry as
a result. Ruhm finds support for this in that younger men, men
lacking pension coverage, and non-White men are more likely
to reenter the workforce. Health may be a very salient part of
the work-retirement decision process among those who are
making work-related decisions under great uncertainty, and
who may not yet be prepared to assume the role of nonworker.
For these individuals, the continued attractions of the worker
role may be sufficiently great that those in good health continue
to work, or resume working following a brief hiatus.
Characteristics or behaviors that make the nonwork role more
acceptable, or that may signal the beginnings of a preretirement
process (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1993), are therefore important con-
siderations.
Hypotheses
These arguments lead to a series of hypotheses about the
variable influence of health on labor force transitions. We sug-
gest that the work-limiting influence of poor health on labor
force transitions will be stronger among those for whom non-
work may be most economically challenging, for the younger
men, as well as for those with working wives. Among those
who have or expect higher nonwork income, who are older,
who have a nonworking spouse, or who are not married, health
is expected to make a smaller marginal contribution to the
choice to modify labor supply. Some literature (Burr et al.,
1996) also leads us to anticipate differences in the association
between health and work transitions between White and
African American men. These effects will be examined empiri-
cally through inspection of a series of interactions including
health status.

METHODS
Data
In this study we use data from a merged sample of respon-
dents from the 1984 and 1985 panels of the Survey of Income
and Program Participation (SIPP; Kasprzyk, Doyle, Goldstein,
& McMillan, 1987). The SIPP is designed to provide data for a
nationally representative sample of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population. Panels are fielded for 2.5 years; the 1984
panel began in October 1983, and the 1985 panel began in
February 1985. The two panels are distinct and contain no over-
lapping respondents. The 1984 and 1985 panels are merged in
the present study to form a combined sample, in order to obtain
a larger sample for analysis. The SIPP interviews respondents
every 4 months and includes information on labor force behavior,
household composition, and other characteristics often reported
on a month-to-month basis. Each 4-month reference period is re-
ferred to as a wave. A health topical module through which in-
formation on health status is obtained occurs in the third wave
for the 1984 panel, and in the sixth wave for the 1985 panel.
Labor force transitions are identified in this study through a
comparison of work status at two timepoints, 8 months apart.
To gauge the association between health and labor force transi-
tions more accurately, we select respondents who participated in
the health topical module in each panel. The observation period
for this study begins at the time of the health report, which oc-
curs in wave 3 for the 1984 panel, and wave 6 for the 1985
panel. Our assessments of initial labor force status and other
characteristics are also obtained at the start of this observation
period. We then assess respondents' labor force status at the end
of the panels, subsequent to the health report. Inasmuch as the
1985 panel includes eight waves, and the health report occurs
in the sixth, we compare labor force status two waves, or eight
months, apart in both panels in order to make the covered time
periods equivalent in length. We are therefore comparing labor
force status reported in the third and fifth waves of the 1984
panel, and in the sixth and eighth waves of the 1985 panel. Due
to the censored nature of the data, the relatively short timeframe
covered, and the lack of repeated measures of key covariates
such as health, examining the time dependency of these issues
is not feasible with the SIPP.
The sample includes Black and White men aged 55 to 69 who
either were included in both thefirstand last waves of our target
period, or died or became institutionalized during this period.
Those who left the sample during the observation period for
other reasons (e.g., refusal to continue participating, moving out
of the interview area) are excluded from the sample. These ex-
clusions total 522 cases equivalent to 11 % of the unweighted
sample. Comparisons of the respondents leaving the sample
with those remaining suggests that those attriting are less likely
to report eligibility for pension income, report somewhat lower
incomes, and are more likely to be from the 1984 panel. All
other comparisons are not statistically significant.
Features of the sample design and patterns of attrition are ac-
counted for by using modified weights generated from the data in
our analyses. We start with the cross-sectional weights generated
by the Census Bureau and included in the SIPP data for the initial
wave of our data. These weights are then adjusted to account for
attrition occurring during the observation period, taking into con-
sideration differential attrition by panel year (1984/1985).
The respondents selected for this study were born between
1915 and 1930 and represent a particularly significant birth co-
hort. This cohort was indelibly affected by the economic up-
heaval of the Great Depression (see Elder, 1974), and many of
its members participated directly or indirectly in World War II.
These were among the first birth cohorts to have their work ca-
reers fully covered by Social Security, and they benefit from the
subsequent changes to the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability
Insurance program, such as the establishment of Medicare and
inflation-adjusted Social Security payments. Large segments of
this cohort took advantage of the GI Bill to pursue higher edu-
cation and advanced training in technical skills after the war.
They are the fathers of the baby boom generation and are noted
for the relatively high quality of their health and economic situ-
ations in later life. These men, who at the time of interview
were either potential or current retirees, represent a cohort of
workers against whom future groups of late-life workers and
retirees will be evaluated. Although the SIPP data are older than
emerging data sets with arguably better indicators of health,
particularly the Health and Retirement Study, they are the only
suitable source of information on this cohort of men, as they
move through their critical retirement decision phase of life.
Moreover, among the most recent data available on the HRS
cohort of men who were aged 51-61 in 1993, many have not
yet moved into the ages considered here. In the future, research
will undoubtedly examine these same questions when addi-
tional HRS data become available.
Variable Definitions
The key theoretical variables are labor force participation
and health. Recent research suggests that, for many older per-
sons, retirement is far from a crisp transition out of the labor
force; instead, men often experience a period of time near the
end of working life where moves in and out of the labor force
are common (Mutchler, Burr, Pienta, & Massagli, 1997). Our
goal is not to assess retirement--an exit from the labor force
does not necessarily correspond to a decision to retire (Henretta,
1992). Rather, our purpose is to examine the relative stability of
worker/nonworker roles in the presence of varying levels of
health. Understanding that these statuses may be imbedded
within a series of work transitions, we focus on labor force par-
ticipation during the month prior to last interview as our out-
come measure. This status, as well as labor force participation
at initial observation, are assessed in the same way: men who
report either working, having ajob but not at work (e.g., on va-
cation or temporary leave), or being unemployed (actively look-
ing for a job) are considered to be labor force participants.
Separate analyses are conducted based on labor force status at
first observation, so those initially observed to be not in the
labor force, but participating in the labor force at last observa-
tion, have reentered the labor force. Similarly, those initially ob-
served participating in the paid labor force, but not working or
looking for work at final observation, have exited the labor
force. Results of the separate analyses can therefore be inter-
preted as reflecting the effects of the independent variables on
labor force transitions.
The measure of health used in this study is based on a self-
ranking of well-being: the five response categories range from
"excellent" to "poor." Although some observers note that
measures of this type may reflect a desirability bias (Bazzoli,
WORK TRANSITIONSAND HEALTH S255
1985; Gibson, 1987), more objective indicators of health also
suffer from response bias (Bound, 1991). Moreover, this criti-
cism is most accurately directed toward concurrent studies of
health and work behavior, in which temporal ordering cannot be
established. In this analysis, self-reported health is assessed at
the initial interview, with the analysis focusing on work transi-
tions occurring in the ensuing months. Note that among those
not in the labor force at initial observation, some of whom may
not have worked for several years, health status at the time of
labor force exit is unknown, although the health report is made
prior to any work transitions observed during the 8-month ob-
servation period. Inasmuch as perceived health may be the pri-
mary basis of action on the part of the individual, the self-rank-
ing measure can be successfully employed as an overall
indicator of health.
A number of economic indicators are used in the analysis,
including eligibility for a pension, personal income, and receipt
of disability income. Pension eligibility assesses the availability
of pension funds beyond income provided by Social Security.
Respondents receiving pensions at initial interview are included
with those reporting that they would be eligible for pension in-
come if they retired within the next few months. Personal in-
come is the one-month total recorded at initial interview, re-
flecting income of the individual prior to transitions in work
status. For those working, much of this income is composed of
earnings. For those not in the labor force, personal income is a
combination of Social Security and/or other nonwage re-
sources. Income is logged in the multivariate analysis to ac-
count for its skewed distribution. Disability payments are also
an important part of the decision to work (Bound & Waidmann,
1992; Quinn & Burkhauser, 1994). Although with these data
we cannot assess whether a working individual would be eligi-
ble for disability payments--and virtually no working men re-
ceived those payments--receipt of disability income may form
a substantial barrier to returning to work. Accordingly, a
dummy variable indicating whether disability payments were
received is included in the reentry model only.
A number of other indicators relating to work and socioeco-
nomic status are also examined. Occupational status is mea-
sured using a dummy variable distinguishing between manual
and nonmanual workers. This indicator controls for features of
job demands that impact on the health-labor force association,
such as physical exertion (see Bound et al., 1995; Chirikos &
Nestel, 1985; and Hayward, Grady, Hardy, & Sommers, 1989,
for discussion of occupational effects). For working individuals,
occupational assessment is based on occupation reported for
current job. Respondents not working during the time period
considered are assigned a value based on the occupation from
which they retired, or the last occupation reported. Individuals
who remained uncoded (n = 264, or 6% of the sample) received
imputed values on the occupational status measure based on re-
ported years of education.
An additional work-related variable is receipt of private in-
surance through current or past employment. Wise (1997) sug-
gests that those covered by an employer's insurance may con-
tinue to work, if insurance is otherwise unavailable, in order to
bridge the time period until eligibility for Medicare is estab-
lished. Moreover, if a worker is eligible for insurance coverage
as a retiree, labor force exit may be facilitated. Wise finds that
respondents in the HRS who are eligible for retiree coverage
are more likely to plan to retire by age 62, but only among those
in excellent or very good health. The insurance variable avail-
able in the SIPP reflects a respondent's coverage by private
health insurance through a current or former employer, union,
or pension plan.
Finally, inasmuch as unemployment may precede or perhaps
precipitate an exit from the labor force (OECD, 1995), a vari-
able is included in the exit model indicating whether unem-
ployment was experienced between the first and last observa-
tion. This variable is not included in the reentry model, because
many men attempting to reenter the labor market would often
experience at least a short spell of unemployment as they search
for work.
Demographic characteristics included in the analysis are age,
marital status, working status of spouse, and race. Age is as-
sessed at initial observation. Wise (1997) identifies several dis-
continuities in the association between age and work exit, cor-
responding to work disincentives in Social Security and many
private pensions, falling at ages 55,60,62, and 65. In addition
to a continuous age variable, spline functions were imposed at
60,62, and 65 to test for these discontinuities. Spline functions
at adjacent ages were also examined in order to assess the result
of "aging into" eligibility through the panel. With one excep-
tion, reflecting a discontinuity at age 65, these spline effects did
not significantly improve model fit and were omitted from the
analysis. The spline effect at age 65 also acts as an important
control on the disability variable in the reentry model, inas-
much as those 65 and over are not eligible for disability pay-
ments. Marital status and working status of spouse are assessed
at first observation. Men whose wives are in the labor force are
coded as having working wives. A dummy variable indicating
race of respondent is also included, as Black and White patterns
of work are known to differ substantially throughout the life
course (Burr et al., 1996; Gibson, 1987; Hayward et al., 1996;
Welch, 1990).
Education level and net worth, although examined by past
research as potentially related to late-life labor supply (Myers,
1991; Parnes & Sommers, 1994), were not significant predic-
tors of either exit or reentry. Therefore, to preserve statistical
power, these variables were omitted from the analysis with no
apparent effect on the reported results. Variables not part of the
analysis that would be desirable include measures of job satis-
faction, self-reported desire for retirement, or other subjective
indicators of attachment to work or nonwork. As no subjective
indicators of this sort are available in the SIPP data, they cannot
be included in the current analysis.
RESULTS
The results are based on the 4,100 men aged 55-69 in the
combined 1984/1985 panels of the SIPP who meet the criteria
outlined above. Members of the weighted sample have a mean
age of 62, and 9% are African American. Just over a third of the
men have working spouses. About half of the respondents are
or were manual workers, and nearly three quarters are either re-
ceiving pension income or will be eligible for a pension upon
retirement. Six percent of these men, all of whom are under age
65, report receiving some disability income. Half of the respon-
dents report being covered by private health insurance through
current or former employer, union, or pension fund.
Table 1 illustrates the observed transition patterns associated
S256 MUTCHLER ETAL.
with each work/health status at first interview. Overall, although
most older men experienced stable labor force statuses over the
observation period, about 10% either changed work status,
died, or became institutionalized. The relatively low rates of
change are a result both of the short observation period and the
age heterogeneity of the sample. Given the cumulative nature
of work exit decisions (e.g., the majority of older men who
leave the labor force do not return), a longer observation period
would necessarily result in our observing a higher rate of exit.
Inasmuch as late-life reentry is often of short duration (Ruhm,
1990) and embedded in a sequence of labor force exits and
reentries (Mutchler et al., 1997), a longer time period would not
affect the reentry rates to the same degree. However, we have
no reason to believe that a longer time period would necessarily
change the extent or conditions under which health affects labor
force behavior. These transition patterns illustrate that good
health was significantly associated with a higher level of attach-
ment to the labor force. Among those men initially observed in
the labor force, 91% of those in excellent or very good health,
but only 83% of those in fair or poor health, remained in the
labor force 8 months later. Rates of exit were twice as high
among those in the worst health compared to those in the best
health (16% vs 8%). Similarly, among those initially observed
to be out of the labor force, men in excellent or very good
health were more than twice as likely to return to the work force
as were their counterparts in fair or poor health (8% of those in
excellent or very good health, but only 3% of those in fair or
poor health). Probabilities of dying or becoming institutional-
ized were much higher for those reporting poor health at first

"Sample created by the authors by merging data from the 1984 and 1985
panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), waves 3-5
(1984 panel) and waves 6-8 (1985 panel). White and African American men

observation, especially if poor health was coupled with absence
of the work role.
Embedded within Table 1, but not reported here, are substan-
tial differences in transition patterns by age (details available
from the corresponding author). Rates of exit for those initially
observed in the labor force (excluding those dying or becoming
institutionalized in the interim) were 5% for men aged 55-59,
14% for men aged 60-64, and 23% for those aged 65-69.
Reentry rates were 11%, 4%, and 3% for the same age groups.
Moreover, health effects were most substantial among the
younger men. For example, the exit rates for the youngest men
in the poorest health were more than three times as high as the
rates for similarly aged men in the best health (10% vs 3%), but
among the oldest men (those 65-69), exit rates were only 14%
higher for those in the worst health (24% vs 21 %). A similar
pattern of health convergence with age is noted for reentry.
Although the descriptive results are consistent with our ear-
lier arguments about the association between health and work
transitions, it is necessary to determine whether this pattern
holds net of other characteristics known to shape labor force
behavior. Because of the categorical nature of the outcome vari-
able, logistic regression techniques are used in the multivariate
analyses (Maddala, 1983). The sample is stratified by labor
force status at time 1, because the processes of exit and entry
are assumed to be state-dependent (Hayward et al., 1996).
Accordingly, two subsamples are defined at initial observation
and analyzed separately: (a) men in the labor force and (b) men
not in the labor force. Stratifying the sample in this way allows
us to examine the mechanisms determining the labor force exit
process and the labor force reentry process separately, without
constraining them to be similar.
A total of 55 men either died or became institutionalized
prior to the last observation and are omitted from the multivari-
ate analysis presented in the subsequent tables. Although this
represents only 1.3% of the sample, they are disproportionately
drawn from the pool of men reporting poor health at first obser-
vation; therefore, care was taken to evaluate the potential bias in
our results due to their exclusion. In additional analyses (not re-
ported here) we included those dying or becoming institutional-
ized as a third outcome category, using multinomial logistic re-
gression techniques to analyze these models. The estimates
obtained for the work-related outcomes were virtually identical
regardless of whether or not death/institutionalization was re-
tained as a competing outcome. This gives us confidence that
the results we report are robust with respect to this issue.
Because the retention of this third category poses methodologi-
cal limitations in later stages of the analysis due to small cell
values, the men who died or became institutionalized during
the study period are excluded.
In Table 2, odds ratios and confidence intervals from a multi-
variate binomial logistic regression analysis are presented. In
the first column of results, odds ratios reflect the chances of ex-
iting the labor force among those initially observed participat-
ing in the labor force. The second column reports odds ratios
for reentering the labor force, among those initially observed to
be not participating. The results illustrate that for this cohort of
men, net of other characteristics, poor health prompted an exit
from the labor force among those initially participating, and in-
hibited return to the labor force among those initially character-
ized as nonworking. Both comparisons reflect a substantial and

statistically significant association of health with labor force
transitions. Although self-ranked health is the preferred mea-
sure for the current analysis, we replicated the analysis using
the only other measure of health status available in both the
1984 and 1985 panels of the SIPP, number of bed days reported
in the past 6 months. The results using this measure were very
similar to those reported here.
With reference to the remaining variables in the model, and
consistent with other literature, an exit from the labor force was
also significantly more likely among the older members of this
cohort (see Table 2, column 1). Nonlinearity in this positive as-
sociation is indicated by a statistically significant spline effect at
age 65, suggesting that the positive effect of age flattened
beyond the age of 65. Men with working wives were less likely
to exit the labor force than were their counterparts with
nonworking wives, and those not married. Those who worked
in a manual occupation at first observation were significantly
more likely to leave the labor force, as were those who were el-
igible for a pension. Those with more income were less likely
to leave, reflecting the greater attachment to the work role asso-
ciated with higher wages. Men who experienced an unemploy-
ment event during the 8 months preceding final interview were
substantially more likely to have left the labor force by the last
observation, suggesting that unemployment may precipitate
exit. Race and coverage by employment-sponsored health in-
surance were not significantly associated with exits from the
labor force after controlling for these other characteristics. The
model fit statistics listed at the bottom of the table suggest a
good fit to the data.
For this cohort, reentry among men initially observed not
working was significantly predicted by a somewhat different
set of variables (see Table 2, column 2). Health, age, marital
status, and occupation were associated with reentry, suggesting
that those in poorer health, those who were older, those without
a working spouse, and those in manual occupations were less
likely to reenter the workforce. Those covered by employment-
sponsored health insurance were much less likely to reenter the
labor force (see Pienta, 1996, for similar results using the HRS
data). This indicates that the absence of private health insurance
may be an important motivation for resuming work. Similarly,
men receiving disability income were only a third as likely to
reenter the labor force as their counterparts without disability
income. Income and pension eligibility were not associated
with reentry at this stage of the analysis, nor was a discontinu-
ous association with age noted.
We next assess the conditions under which health is most
strongly associated with work behavior. In the preceding dis-
cussion, we suggested that men who were most drawn to the
labor force--those with working wives and those with limited
nonwork incomes, as well as those who were younger--would
be most sensitive to health contingencies. Analytically, these
expectations require us to examine a series of interactions be-
tween health and other characteristics of the individual. Wefita
series of models, each including a single interaction with health,
and examine the results for improvement in model fit over the
results presented in Table 2 (model fit statistics are available
from the corresponding author). In order to establish the condi-
tions under which health has a variable association with work
behavior, all interactions including the combination of health
and the other variables were examined. To facilitate interpreta-
tion, predicted probabilities are generated based on the results,
using a consistent set of characteristics associated with the "av-
erage" respondent (see footnote a in Table 3).
Across the sets of results, only two interactions improved the
fit of the model for those at risk of exiting the labor force: the
interactions of health with marital status and with age. For those
at risk of reentry (those not working at first observation), four
interactions significantly improved model fit: those involving
health with pension eligibility, with personal income, with age,
and with race. With the exception of race, these are the interac-
tions we expected. The figures reported in Panel A of Table 3
refer to the probability that the typical respondent working at
first observation was no longer working at the last observation.
Thefirstcolumn reports this probability for men who are in ex-
cellent health (ranking 1 on the 5-point scale), and the second

Calculations are weighted. Estimates are based on an "average" respondent:
aged 62, not married/with nonworking spouse, eligible for a pension, manual
occupation, mean income given time 1 work status, except when otherwise
noted in the Table. The formula for calculating predicted probabilities from bi-
nomial logistic regression results is as follows (Cherlin, Kiernan, & Chase-
Lansdale, 1995):/? = (e^/(l + eXii)). The estimates from the multivariate logis-
tic regression models used to compute the predicted probabilities are available
from the authors.
bMeasured at time 1; therefore reflects nonwork income only.
and third columns report the probability for men who were in
good or poor health, respectively (ranking 3 or 5 on the scale).
All other respondent characteristics are the same for each row's
estimates. The fourth column in the table reports the signifi-
cance level of the interaction term (in all cases the main effects
retain or take on significance as well).
The first line of the table reports estimated probabilities
based on the Table 2 results, and shows the progressive increase
in probability of exit associated with poorer health. The next
two lines of Table 3 (Panel A) are based on interactions between
marital status and health. The predicted probability of exit for
men with working wives and in excellent health was 0.07.
Similar men in poor health had a predicted probability of exit
of 0.31. In contrast, men who had nonworking spouses and men
who were not married were not as responsive to health status in
their decisions to leave the labor force. Those who reported ex-
cellent health had a predicted probability of exit of 0.17--
which is substantially higher than the other men in excellent
health--but this probability increased to only 0.24 among those
in poor health. In short, health had a significantly smaller im-
pact on these men's decisions to leave the labor force. The re-
sults suggest that having a working wife may strengthen men's
attachment to work if they themselves are in good health, yet
facilitates work exit among men who are in poor health (see
also Pienta, 1996).
The interaction of age and health also results in a significant
improvement in model fit for men initially observed in the labor
force. These results suggest that younger men in this cohort
were most sensitive to health contingencies. Consistent with
our arguments, those likely to have the greatest continued at-
tachment to work--here, those too young to receive substantial
retirement benefits--were most responsive to poor health. Men
age 58 who were in poor health were expected to exit the labor
force at a rate that is four times the rate of their counterparts in
excellent health. In contrast, men age 62 who were in poor
health had an expected probability of exit that is 1.5 times as
great as their healthy counterparts. By age 66, men who were in
poor health were expected to exit at a rate just 40% more than
their healthy counterparts.
Panel B of Table 3 reports predicted probabilities for the
reentry models including interactions of health with pension el-
igibility, personal (nonwork) income, age, and race. The first
line suggests that, overall, the probability of return to work is
low, but that the effect of health is substantial. With regard to
pension coverage, differences in the probability of returning to
the labor force were minimal across levels of health, among
those eligible for or receiving pension income. Members of this
cohort who were nonworkers with pensions were very unlikely
to return to work even if in excellent health. In contrast, those
with no pension eligibility were significantly more likely to
reenter if in excellent health. Overall, although the probability
of return was small across the board, the effect of health was
negligible for those covered by a pension, but more sizable for
those not covered.
Health status also has a more substantial association with
labor force transitions among those with limited nonwork in-
come. Nonworking men with incomes at the 25th percentile
were substantially more likely to return to work if they were in
excellent health than if they were in poor health (a predicted
probability of 5% as opposed to 1%), while effect of health was
progressively more constrained for men at higher levels of in-
come. We note that these interactive effects of personal income
and pension eligibility are, as would be expected, highly corre-
lated with one another. When both sets of interactions are in-
cluded in the same model, the coefficients involving pension el-
igibility become nonsignificant, suggesting that both are
reflecting higher nonwork economic resources.
Similar to the pattern reported for labor force exit, the inter-
action with age reflects a strong impact of health on reentry
among the youngest men, with health having little association
with reentry among those who were older. Finally, model fit
statistics suggest that a model including a race interaction
WORK TRANSITIONSAND HEALTH S259
provides a significantly better fit to the data than does the main
effects model, for the men initially observed not working. The
predicted probabilities for both groups of men suggest that the
association between health and work transitions was more lim-
ited for White men than for Black men in this cohort. Notably,
Black men in excellent health were particularly likely to return
to work by the last observation. This result is consistent with
the observation that the higher levels of nonwork among older
Black men are more reflective of poor health than of the greater
desirability of the retirement status (Burr et al., 1996; Hayward
et al., 1996; Mutchler & Burr, 1991).
DISCUSSION
Labor force transition patterns of men aged 55-69 in the
mid-1980s were examined with the goal of developing an un-
derstanding of the conditions under which health status is re-
lated to work behavior in later life. Previous research has estab-
lished the association of health with work status and transitions
(Hardy, 1982; Morgan, 1981; Sammartino, 1987; Smith, 1985).
Our study demonstrates that for the cohort of men considered
here, the effects of health status on both labor force exit and
reentry are sizable. Those in poor health were considerably
more likely than their more healthy counterparts to leave the
labor force and to remain nonworking.
Although selected interactions between health and other
work-related characteristics have been suggested in the litera-
ture, previous research has not systematically examined the ex-
tent to which other relevant characteristics condition the associ-
ation between health and late-life work transitions. Our study
extends previous literature by examining these interactive ef-
fects. Results presented here suggest that for this cohort of men,
health had its most substantial impact on those who were other-
wise attracted to work because of family, normative, or eco-
nomic factors. For example, men in our study who were in ex-
cellent health and unmarried, or married to nonworking wives,
were much less sensitive to health contingencies in decisions to
exit the labor force, suggesting that they may have been eager
to experience retirement while in a healthy state. Those most
likely to continue working or return to work were those with
other characteristics fostering a continued work attachment--in
particular, those whose wives were still working and those with
limited nonwork financial resources. The interactions of health
with age and with race (on labor force return) suggest that nor-
mative or other pressures not measured here may also play a
role in an individual's response to health.
Our results show that for older men in the mid-1980s, health
shaped work behavior in different ways, depending upon other
work-related characteristics. If this pattern holds for subsequent
cohorts, our results suggest that the influence of trends in health
and disability may be partially determined by trends in other
work-related characteristics, such as marital status and eco-
nomic status. For example, a combination of improved health
among men, and rising rates of labor force participation among
married women, would be expected to increase the attachment
of men to the labor force. Yet, either trend in isolation would
have the opposite effect. Because men in moderate to poor
health have lower than expected attachments to work if they are
married to working women, rising rates of labor force activity
among married women in the absence of improved health of
older men may result in higher rates of exit and lower rates of
reentry. Similarly, rising rates of marital disruption may result
in health having less of an influence on older men's work tran-
sitions in the future.
Should health status continue to improve into later life as ex-
pected, our results indicate that patterns of nonwork earlier in
later life may be curbed somewhat as a result. In our study, the
youngest men with the best health were least likely to exit the
workforce, and most likely to return if an exit had already oc-
curred. Yet, for this cohort, health had a substantially smaller
association with work behavior for men in their 60s and be-
yond. Improved health for these age groups, while a worthy
goal on other bases, may have little impact on labor force par-
ticipation rates among older men.
Our study demonstrates that economic status also shaped the
association between health and labor force transitions for this
cohort, especially with regard to the reentry decision.
Accordingly, the future impact of health on labor force transi-
tions may be partially a result of trends in economic well-being
in later life. Some research suggests that tomorrow's elderly co-
horts will be at least as well off in retirement as were their par-
ents (Easterlin, Schaeffer, & Macunovich, 1993). If so, efforts
to retain healthy older men as part of the workforce will need to
focus on developing additional attractions to the work role, per-
haps focusing on the intrinsic appeal of work. However, other
analysts regard the economic status of future elderly cohorts as
more uncertain, given the rising age at which an individual may
receive full Social Security benefits, future (as yet undefined)
changes in Social Security eligibility, and the potentially nega-
tive economic consequences of greater emphasis on defined-
contribution pension systems (Besl & Kale, 1996). As well,
changes in Medicare, coupled with the increasing reluctance
among employers to offer retiree health insurance coverage
(Besl & Kale, 1996), may alter the true costs of nonwork.
Should economic difficulty be more commonly experienced in
later life, or should older men come to regard even the combi-
nation of Social Security and pension incomes as inadequate to
support their desired retirement lifestyle, the dual statuses of
healthy nonworker may become something that few older men
can afford. If so, we expect that labor force attachment may be-
come stronger, at least among those in good health.
Limitations of the Study
Our results, although suggestive, must be interpreted with an
understanding of the limitations of our study. One limitation
relates to the short time period covered here. Due to the single re-
port of health status in these data, men are observed over a period
ofjust 8 months, over which time work transitions are necessar-
ily limited in number. A longer observation period would result
in higher estimated transition rates and, if there is a long lag
time between health-compromising events and work behavior
accommodations, our analysis offers an incomplete assessment
of the association between health and work transitions.
However, it is unclear whether the primary outcomes of this
study--examining the association between health and transi-
tion rates, singly as well as interacting with other work-related
characteristics--would be modified with a longer observation
period. An understanding of the extent to which this limitation
shapes our results will require replication with additional data,
using longer observation periods.
Another limitation of our study is the single self-reported
S260 MUTCHLERETAL.
assessment of health. If self-assessments are offered with sub-
sequent work transitions planned, our conclusions may be
compromised. Moreover, although researchers of the health-
employment relationship have yet to agree on an optimal mea-
surement of health, a multiple indicator approach to assessing
health would provide more confidence in our results (see Bound
etal.,1996).
An additional limitation is the lack of any subjective evalua-
tions of work and retirement, such as attitude toward retirement
and satisfaction with work, by the respondents in our study. It is
useful to consider the less tangible benefits of work for older in-
dividuals if older men in good health are to be attracted to the
world of work. In addition, if some of the measures included
are in fact proxies for intrinsic appeal of work (e.g., occupation,
income), our conclusions may be limited.
Finally, the omission of women from the analysis is an impor-
tant limitation. The exclusion of women from this study is justi-
fied by the knowledge that women respond to work-related char-
acteristics in different ways than do men (see Pienta, Burr, &
Mutchler, 1994), and the likelihood that the factors influencing
the association between health and work transitions also differ.
Yet, as women continue to make up a growing portion of the total
workforce, our understanding of the issues examined here will
remain partial until parallel studies are completed for women.
Future research should focus on remedying these limitations
of our research and establishing the generalizability of our re-
sults. Although other data suitable for the examination of work
transitions suffer from their own unique limitations, the basic
issues considered here could be examined using data from the
National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, the Retirement
History Study, and other data sources. Emerging data from the
Health and Retirement Study offer a promising opportunity for
replication of our results, and possible modification of our con-
clusions, based on the experience of more recent cohorts. In ad-
dition, the HRS offers multiple measures of health as well as
some constructs not available in our study. Indeed, several
trends in late-life work behavior, as well as the economy at
large, suggest that contemporary cohorts may display some-
what different patterns of behavior than those reported here
(Herz, 1995). An increase in the number of pension recipients
who are working in the paid labor force over the last decade or
more may have contributed to growing normative support for
working in later life across the board. Along with these norma-
tive shifts, other changes may have resulted in fewer barriers to
reentering the labor force among contemporary cohorts.
Particularly important in this regard is the growing importance
of the service economy, which is noted for its flexible time
scheduling and limited physical demands placed on workers.
Increased availability ofjobs with these characteristics may re-
sult in today's older individuals in moderate to poor health
being less likely to leave, and more likely to return, than those
in the mid-1980s (see also Besl & Kale, 1996).
