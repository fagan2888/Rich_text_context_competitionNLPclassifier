Abstract
Objective: This study assessed the mode of application (oral, intravenous or subcutaneous (SC))
currently employed in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients from Qatar in
comparison with patients' individual preferences for the mode of application of their treatment.
Methods: This study included 294 RA patients visiting three clinics at the main referral hospital
in Qatar who were interviewed using a standard questionnaire to determine their preference of
mode of application for their disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in
relation to their currently employed mode of application.
Results: The majority of patients were female (76%), and 93% of male patients and 61% of female
patients in the study clinics were of a nationality other than Qatari. The highest patient preference
recorded was for an oral therapy (69%), compared with injection (23%) and intravenous (8%)
therapy. In total, 85% of patients expressed a preference to remain on oral therapy compared with
63% and 58% of intravenous and SC injection patients indicating a preference to remain on their
current method of administration.
Conclusions: This high preference for oral therapies highlights the considerable need for
incorporation of new oral targeted synthetic DMARD therapies into clinical practice within the
region.

Introduction
Despite the introduction of biologic therapies
for the treatment of inflammatory diseases
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the
1990s, there remain many unmet needs in the
modern management of rheumatology at a
global level. However, this global perspective
cannot reflect the individual situations of
patients in different countries and regions.
Consequently, specific regional unmet needs
are deserving of special examination, and
here we will focus on RA patients in Qatar.
The hot, humid climate, healthcare system
and population demographics in this area of
the world attribute unique considerations for
practising rheumatologists in this region that
may differ to those of specialists treating RA
in the rest of the world. New therapies are
currently being developed that aim to address
some of these unmet needs, including novel
oral therapies such as targeted synthetic
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(tsDMARDs).1 It is widely expected that
patients will prefer to receive an oral therapy
over a subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV)
one,2,3 but this may not be the case for all
groups. Additionally, there are concerns
about compliance and wasted drug with
oral medication. To give regional guidance
on the use of newly available therapies, we
have conducted a patient preference and
profile survey, the results of which are pre-
sented here alongside a review of the situ-
ation in Qatar and the wider Arabian Gulf
region.
RA management in the Arabian Gulf
RA is a chronic inflammatory disease with
an estimated prevalence of 0.5­1% in
Northern Europe and North America.4
However, there are few large epidemio-
logical studies or good-quality registry data
to suggest the disease's overall prevalence in
the region of the Arabian Gulf.5­7 Small
population and hospital-based studies give
wide variation, from 0.19% in rural Iran to
1.0% of the adult population in Lebanon
and Iraq.8­12 In Oman, the prevalence of RA
in the population has been calculated at
8.4 cases per 1,000 adults (0.84%).13
Disease severity also varies geographic-
ally, and it has traditionally been believed
that most Arab patients with RA have a
non-aggressive form of the disease.5,14 These
beliefs may lead to significant delays in
diagnosis and treatment.15 However, the
disease severity is, in fact, comparable to
that seen in other parts of the world,15­17
with physicians reporting only 12% of
patients in clinical practice having low dis-
ease activity in this region (LDA; defined as
disease activity score (DAS) 28 < 3.2).16
It has long been accepted that there are
cultural differences in how RA is managed
in the Middle East.18 Management practices
vary widely ­ often depending on the socio-
economic status of individual patients and
complicated by local infrastructure or lack
of it ­ but there are signs that disease
management strategy is evolving in the
Middle East ­ and the Gulf states in particu-
lar ­ and many clinicians are now imple-
menting up-to-date treatment guidelines and
recommendations from international socie-
ties.5,15 In Qatar, the majority of patients
receive conventional synthetic (cs)
DMARDs, and 64% of patients seen in
the clinic achieve LDA or remission.19 Yet
despite this move towards modern practice,
RA patients often experience a delay in
734 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
diagnosis: a recent study in Dubai found
erosions in 55% of patients, suggesting
a delay in diagnosis and management.16
A review examining the use of the
European League Against Rheumatism
(EULAR) recommendations in this region
found that there were barriers to implemen-
tation, mainly for those individual recom-
mendations that advocated aggressive
management, early use of intensive therapy
and frequent monitoring.15 There still exists
a significant regional unmet need in the
management of RA.
Regional environmental considerations in
the management of RA
There are certain regional environmental
considerations that impact the management
of RA patients. The first of these relates to
the climate, as summer temperatures in
Qatar can surpass 49C.20 To prevent dis-
ruption of the ``cold chain,'' biologic drugs
are dispensed in a chilled bag from the
pharmacy. Although air conditioning is
common in cars and homes, it is not entirely
ubiquitous for the poorest in society and
there is a risk that medication may be
spoiled.
Ramadan fasting ­ a fundamental pillar
of Islam ­ may have an effect on patient
compliance and disease activity.21,22 Whilst
patients with chronic diseases may not be
required to fast during Ramadan, many still
do, and this has an impact on adherence and
disease activity.22 Many patients prefer not
to take oral or intravenous medications
during fasting hours,21 and as such, patients
might only take their therapies after sunset
and before sunrise.23­25 This alteration in
dosing schedule has a clear impact on
compliance.21 Some patients may not
agree to medical procedures such as
blood tests during Ramadan, which may
have an impact on routine monitoring.21
Anecdotally, RA patients often do better
during Ramadan and feel well because they
are fasting, but then flare afterwards.26,27
There is some speculation that this may be
because the foods traditionally eaten during
the Ramadan month are better for RA
patients than those consumed during the
rest of the year, including an increase in
protein consumption and a reduction in
carbohydrate intake, and that fasting has a
direct effect on laboratory parameters.26­28
An important take-home point from the
studies discussed here is that most patients
did not receive any particular information
about changing their treatment during
Ramadan. More research is required in
this area to further understand the effects
of Ramadan on adherence and disease
activity.
Given the unmet needs in this region, this
study aimed to investigate the level of
disease activity in the region and patients'
preferences regarding the route of adminis-
tration for their therapy.
Methods
The authors met at a face-to-face meeting in
September 2014. On the basis of discussions,
a cross-sectional patient survey was
designed to collect data on the typical RA
patient profile in the region (Box 1). The
survey was conducted among 294 consecu-
tive patients across three clinics in Qatar.
Ethics committee approval was waivered for

this study as all RA patients at the three
participating clinics within Qatar are regis-
tered in the regional RA registry, for which
they provide signed consent for their data to
be used for publication purposes. The pre-
defined primary clinical end point was the
preferred mode of application (oral, IV, SC)
in comparison with the patient's currently
employed mode of application for treatment
and in relation to their disease activity.
Summary statistics are reported as either a
mean with the minimum and maximum
range for continuous data (such as the age
of the patient) or as a total for count data
(such as the number of patients on each
mode of application).
Descriptive statistics were employed for
the analysis of baseline demographics.
Among the population analysed, the
patients´ nationality was dichotomized into
Qatari and non-Qatari patients.
The mode of application employed and
preferred was analysed separately for IV, SC
and oral administration. Whether patients
treated with a certain mode of application
were pre-treated with another mode of
application was not analysed in this survey.
For the analysis of co-morbid diseases the
results focussed on cardiovascular condi-
tions (including diabetes, hypertension,
hyper/dyslipoproteinemia or other), none
and not reported.
Results
In our patient survey, 76% of patients in
the study clinics were female. The mean age
for women was 48 years (range 16­84),
and 51 years for men (range 24­75). Our
patient survey also captured the split
between Qatari nationals and non-Qatari
nationals, with 93% of male patients and
61% of female patients in the study clinics
being of a nationality other than Qatari
(Table 1).
Of the 294 patients in our survey across
three clinics in Qatar, 69% expressed a
preference for oral therapy, 23% for SC
injection and 8% for intravenous adminis-
tration (Table 2). Highest patient preference
was for oral therapy, with 85% of patients
who received it expressing a preference to
stay on oral therapy. In contrast, only 63%
and 58% of intravenous and SC injection
patients, respectively, indicated a preference
to remain on their current method of admin-
istration (Figure 1). The mean age of
patients with recorded co-morbidities was
55 years (range 17­74), with 88 patients
(30%) diagnosed with one or more cardio-
vascular diseases (Table 3).
The level of disease activity in RA
patients is most commonly measured via
DAS and/or clinical disease activity index
(CDAI). The level of disease activity can be
interpreted as low (2.6 < DAS28 3.2)
(2.8 < CDAI 10), moderate (3.2 < DAS
5.1) (10 < CDAI 22), or high (DAS > 5.1)
(CDAI > 22) with a DAS 2.6 or
CDAI 2.8 corresponding to remission.29
In our survey, whilst DAS was recorded in
only 256 patients, CDAI was recorded in all
294 (mean overall score 9.07; range 0­55).
There was agreement between DAS and

patients, two-thirds showed a DAS higher
than the CDAI and one-third had a CDAI
higher than DAS (Table 4). Our results show
that, among the patients in our survey, over
half had not yet achieved a CDAI LDA
score (2.8 CDAI 10) with their current
treatment (Table 4).

Among patients surveyed for whom the
level of disease activity was recorded, the
majority (70%) with a recorded DAS of
LDA or remission preferred the option of an
oral therapy. The majority of patients with a
recorded DAS of high disease activity also
preferred the option of an oral therapy
(77%). These high percentages for a pre-
ferred oral therapy were also reflected across
the CDAI scores collected in our survey. Of
those patients with a CDAI score of LDA or
remission, 53% preferred the option of an
oral therapy, and of those with a CDAI
score of high disease activity, 74% preferred
the option of an oral therapy.
Discussion
Social and access considerations
Several key social considerations have a
bearing on access to therapy for RA patients
in the Arabian Gulf. A patient's preferred

route of administration for their therapy is
often cited as a barrier to receiving therapy.
It is assumed that patients prefer oral ther-
apy, and several studies across a variety of
chronic diseases have indeed found this
pattern.30­34 Research suggests that 44% of
RA patients are not confident in adminis-
tering their own injections.2 Patients in these
countries are also often undertreated5,16 and
there is wide variation in treatment, with 5%
of patients in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and 29% in Qatar receiving a bio-
logic, compared with over 40% of eligible
patients in the USA.19 In part, this can be
attributed to the high socioeconomic burden
of other more prevalent diseases in the
Middle East and Arabian Gulf countries,
such as diabetes.15 Public awareness regard-
ing RA is also generally low in the region,
but data from the UAE show that the
introduction of patient support groups and
disease awareness campaigns are beginning
to show an effect.35
Of particular note are the population
dynamics, which are unique in the region
and have a direct impact on healthcare
provision and health economics. In particu-
lar, Qatar has an unusually high rate of
temporary expatriates: Qatari nationals
make up only about 6% of the overall
adult population, with the majority of the
country's residents being migrant workers
from Asia, Africa and Europe.36 In a recent
cross-sectional study of 100 consecutive
rheumatology patients at Hamad General
Hospital in Doha, less than a quarter of
patients were Qatari nationals; the majority
(59%) were immigrant workers from Asia.
Most of the Qatari patients were female
(91%) compared with only 53% of the
Asian patients, which reflects the high pro-
portion of male immigrant workers.19 In our
survey, we found that less than a third of
patients from the three clinics were Qatari
nationals and that these were almost exclu-
sively women (95%), compared with only
67% of non-national female patients.
This population skew has a direct bearing
on clinical practice, since Qatari nationals
receive free healthcare but non-Qatari immi-
grants do not ­ although those with a
residency visa have free access to primary
and emergency healthcare services and pay
only 20% of the costs of speciality health-
care services and drugs.19 The Doha study
found that 65% of Qatari national patients
received biologic therapies, compared with
15% of eligible Asian immigrants.19 Whilst
some workers have medical insurance, the
majority of immigrant labourers do not, and
they cannot always pay for treatment. It is
quite typical for these patients to visit their
rheumatologist only when they can afford it,
and this means that they are often untreated
and flaring. Additionally, workers may
return to their home country for extended
periods between contracts and, as such, they
are lost to follow-up in the clinic. This high
proportion of expatriates and lack of appro-
priate medical insurance were cited as key
reasons why physicians in countries in the
region have been unable to implement the
EULAR recommendations in clinical prac-
tice.15 The results of our survey align with
the region, representing varying and hetero-
geneous patient populations and the chal-
lenge this presents for clinicians looking to
adopt guidelines or recommendations.5 By
the end of 2015, under new compulsory
health insurance legislation in Qatar, it will
be a requirement for companies to insure all
non-Qatari workers,37 although the policies
may not cover modern biologic therapies.
For these workers, in particular, affordable
oral therapies that can easily be transported
and self-administered may prevent patients
from taking breaks from therapy that may
cause serious long-term damage to their
joints.
The literature reports typical patient pro-
files in the Arab region as being predomin-
antly female, with a mean age of around
40 years at assessment.12,19,35,38­40 Patient
age is an important factor that may also
Emadi et al. 739
impact treatment decisions41 ­ not least
because older patients tend to have more
co-morbidities, such as diabetes and heart
failure. In our survey, the mean age of
patients with recorded co-morbidities was
55 years (range 17­74), with 88 patients
(30%) diagnosed with cardiovascular dis-
eases (Table 3). These numbers are of par-
ticular importance ­ in 2012, four Gulf
Cooperation Council countries (Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain) were
among the top ten countries for highest
diabetes prevalence rates in the world, with
20.52%, 17.87%, 16.28% and 17.53% of
patients affected, respectively.42
There are several limitations to this study.
First, only the mode of application of treat-
ment was assessed through the survey;
therapy type was not specified, with no
direct comparisons between different thera-
pies being drawn. Second, further clinical
subgroups, including length of time on treat-
ment, socioeconomic status and patient-
reported outcomes, were not defined.
Future research into these areas could further
build upon the current landscape and patient
profiles within the region.
The future of RA therapy
Whilst there are clear unmet needs remain-
ing for RA patients in the Arabian Gulf
region, there are new oral tsDMARD
therapies both available and in development
that may offer some benefit. As well as the
obvious benefits for needle-phobic patients
or those who are unwilling or unable to
inject themselves, these therapies are
expected to be cheaper than biologics and
will not be subject to the same requirements
for cold storage, which may make them
more suitable for populations exposed to
hot summers and periods of travel.
Additionally, new oral tsDMARD therapies
can be taken with or without food,43 and are
therefore not expected to have any food
interactions that would complicate the
dosing schedule during Ramadan. However,
these new therapies will require a shift in
clinical practice to be accommodated.
Our group's clinical advice for rheuma-
tologists considering using new oral
tsDMARD therapies in their patients is
based on the European and US experience
to date.44­46 Patients with autoimmune dis-
eases, such as RA, are at increased risk for
infections,45 but biologic and new oral
tsDMARD therapies may make patients
more susceptible to opportunistic infec-
tions.47 At the forefront are recommenda-
tions for vaccination against herpes zoster
(HZ), as high numbers of cases of HZ were
observed in clinical trials of some new
therapies.48 The routine measurement of
varicella titres in patients is recommended:
patients found to have a protective range
can safely start therapy, but those with low
titres should receive varicella or zostervax
vaccine 2­3 weeks before starting therapy.
Individual vaccination status should always
be checked by the rheumatologist and
updated prior to the initiation of any immu-
nomodulatory therapy.44,46 Tuberculosis
(TB) has a prevalence of 3­43/100,000 per-
sons in the region.49 The advice and recom-
mendations for the prevention and
management of TB in patients receiving
new oral tsDMARD therapies are the same
as those for biologics, with new patients
receiving a skin test prior to initiation of
therapy and every year thereafter.
It is this group's recommendation that all
physicians should endeavour to record the
CDAI for every patient to gain a full picture
of the disease burden and pattern. In order
for disease remission to be an implementable
target, both in clinical studies and in prac-
tice, it needs to be easy to calculate at the
bedside. Aletaha et al.50 demonstrated that
simpler composite indices using an arith-
metic sum of the same components (SDAI
and CDAI) correlate well with DAS.
Recently, in Qatar, there has been a
change in clinical practice in the use of
740 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
disease measurements. It is becoming
increasingly common to record the CDAI
at every patient visit, although DAS is still
used for registry data collection.
Despite advances in treatment and man-
agement strategies, discord and misconcep-
tion around the prevalence, severity and
burden of RA persist in the Arabian Gulf
region and represent a key barrier to early
and appropriate treatment.15 Overall, a
preference for oral therapies over injection
or infusion was observed in this study, and
the greatest patient preference was for oral
therapies. Whilst this survey did not capture
the reasons for the patients' preferred route
of administration, it is suspected that oral
therapy is considered more convenient in
this highly mobile, working population. On
this basis, we recommend that the incorpor-
ation of new oral tsDMARD therapies into
clinical practice will help to fulfil the current
unmet treatment needs and alleviate the
burden on patients and healthcare
resources.
