Introduction
Communication does not stand apart from reality. There is not,
first, reality and then, second, communication. Communication
participates in the formulization and change of reality.
--Richard Ericson (1998)
Hours after the attacks on the World Trade Center on
September 11, 2001, media outlets scrambled to discover
who was responsible; speculation abounded concerning
which terrorist groups were likely culprits and what areas of
the world were capable of harboring such organizations. The
usual suspects were identified by every news network. Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other Middle Eastern countries were men-
tioned as potential loci for those responsible. These countries
were then presented to audiences as potential targets for a
United States'retaliation. State of the art technology allowed
the networks to cut directly to reporters stationed in the dis-
tant countries, and live interviews were carried out, made
possible by satellite transmissions.
About 12:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, one network cut
to a correspondent overseas (in a Middle Eastern country--I
have forgotten which one). The correspondent was filmed on
top of a building while bombs exploded in the distance. He
then speculated that the United States had already begun
retaliating. He turned away from the camera and pointed to
the distance where visible explosions could be seen and
heard. The message conveyed from the correspondent was
that the explosions were potentially the result of a United
States' counterattack. The quick response was exclusively
reported on the network (I do not believe any rival networks
reported such news), no doubt to get the edge and be the first
to report on the United States' military insurgence.
After this segment, the network went back to a reporter in
New York to cover more on the wreckage of the fallen build-
ings.About an hour later, the network cut back to the reporter
in the Middle East for an update; the reporter then recanted
his initial speculation of U.S. retaliation by reporting instead
that the bombs dropping in the distance were actually the
result of a war between a neighboring country--a daily
occurrence for the region and not out of the ordinary. In fact,
attacks within the country had been occurring daily for years.
In retrospect, such a quick retaliation by the United States
was not likely since information about those responsible was
still obscure. However, the interesting aspect to this report
was that for the hour after it was initially reported, it seemed
feasible, even likely that the news was true. This framing of
the event was powerful, albeit grossly misleading. Past

The Hermeneutics of Frames and
Framing: An Examination of the Media's
Construction of Reality
Michael J. Carter1
Abstract
Frames are organizing principles that are socially shared and persistent over time, and that work symbolically to meaningfully
structure the social world. The study of framing has grown over the past decades as mass media has become more and more
ubiquitous in society. People rely on media for information and access to local, national, and world events. This reliance on
the media is important to address as news stories are essentially narratives and interpretations--By focusing on one aspect
of an event and presenting it to an audience, media outlets construct reality. This construction operates by making certain
aspects of stories more salient than others. This salience then "frames" an event and provides a reference point for viewers
in which all subsequent information is judged upon. This article examines the current literature on framing and examines what
techniques and methodologies are used by past and present sociologists and media scholars. Particular attention is given to
the hermeneutics of frames, that is, how frames and framing influence individuals to interpret events in various ways.

research has focused on the mistreatment of similar events
by the media (Durham, 1998; Reese & Buckalew, 1995).
These studies, along with the example of how the media
framed the events on September 11, 2001, showcase how the
media construct reality.
The Growth of Media
The past century witnessed unprecedented change in mass
communications. The emergence of radio and television
allowed messages and information to be transmitted instan-
taneously. With mass media's emergence came a new phe-
nomenon; people more and more depended and relied on
information gathered by individuals whom they have never
met. This aspect of mass communications may seem a trivial
part of contemporary American society, but to treat it as triv-
ial ignores many important implications and assumptions
implicit in modern media. People access information from
media news services all the time. News is transmitted glob-
ally almost as soon as it occurs, if not concurrently. This
increased reliance on mass media has spawned criticism and
analysis by academics interested in communication theory;
the hermeneutics of television, radio, and print media are
ubiquitous in the literature on media and popular culture.
Much of this literature addresses framing, or how the media
creates and re-creates reality through the presentation of
scripts, pictures, and contexts.
This article examines how the study of framing has
evolved over time, and reviews previous and current work
that addresses such phenomena. First, the mechanisms
behind the social construction of reality are examined.Asyn-
opsis of Berger and Luckmann's work on social epistemol-
ogy is presented as a foundation to understanding the
sociology of frame analysis. Second, the definitions of
frames and framing are summarized. Scholars have defined
frames and frame analysis differently; this article addresses
these disparities and treats each figure work as a part of the
overall understanding of framing. Third, the history, research,
and literature on frames and framing techniques are dis-
cussed. Particular aspects to framing, such as the ways in
which the media distort events, how time and immediacy
affect the construction of news, how stories are (or are not)
placed within a historical context, and the psychology of
framing are examined. Finally, empirical examples are given
to illustrate how frames shape and construct social reality.
The Social Construction of Reality
There is a vast literature on the social construction of reality.
Berger and Luckmann's (1966) work set the bar for subse-
quent research, and their contribution needs to be mentioned
prior to looking at the more specific manifestations of media
framing.
InTheSocialConstructionofReality,BergerandLuckmann
(1966) address the role of communication and the importance
of language for social organization. The central theme is that
language is not only used by human beings as a means of
communication, but it also serves as a defining aspect of
humanity. The ability to develop language systems (verbal
and nonverbal) is a unique factor that separates human beings
from the animal kingdom.
Language and the ability to communicate through sym-
bolic objectification not only are a determining factor of
humanity but also play a crucial role in the organization of
the social world. This organization is made possible through
symbols and signs: "A special but crucially important case
of objectivation is signification, that is, the human produc-
tion of signs. A sign may be distinguished from other objec-
tivations by its explicit intention to serve as an index of
subjective meanings" (Berger & Luckmann, 1966, p. 35).
Human social organization depends on this sign system:
"Intersubjective sedimentation" can be called social only
when it has been objectified in a sign system of one kind or
another--that is, when the possibility of reiterated objectifi-
cation of the shared experiences arises (Berger & Luckmann,
1966, p. 67). The development of knowledge and language
is at the core of society's fundamental dialectic. It "pro-
grams" the channels in which externalization produces an
objective world, objectifying it through language and the
cognitive apparatus based on language. In other words, it
orders the world into objects that are in turn "apprehended,"
or seen as reality (Berger & Luckmann, 1966, p. 66).
Understanding the basic mechanisms to how meanings are
constructed and shared is necessary before delving into the
epistemology of framing. Berger and Luckmann (1966) rig-
orously analyze how reality is socially constructed. Their
work provides the underpinnings for frame analysis.
Research on television provides an example of how
Berger and Luckmann's (1966) work can be applied to
understand contemporary media. G. E. Lang and Lang (1984;
Lipschultz & Hilt, 1999) illustrate how television is used to
shape viewers' perceptions of reality:
1. Television emphasizes close-up views creating a sense of
familiarity with distant people and places.
2. Live event coverage gives viewers a sense of participation
in public affairs.
3. Television pictures seem authentic to viewers.
4. Television coverage may provide a more complete picture of
the event than any other media. (G. E. Lang & Lang, 1984, p. 26)
Television thus shapes perceptions in a way unique to the
medium. Specifically, Berger and Luckmann's (1966) work
help one understand how television frames segments of
reality by producing images and messages that are seem-
ingly complete. Given that people spend so much time
watching television, it is no surprise how influential the
medium can be. According to constructivist media effects
Carter 3
models, audiences rely on versions of reality built from per-
sonal experience, interaction with peers, and interpreted
selections from the mass media (Neuman et al., 1992;
Scheufele, 1999). The dynamic of the media (television and
other forms of media) simply introduces additional filters
for perceiving the social world.
Berger and Luckmann's (1966) work is relevant to all
subsequent research on media framing. Tuchman's (1978)
rhetoric resonates closely with the themes developed in The
Social Construction of Reality: "The act of making news is
the act of constructing reality itself rather than a picture of
reality" (p. 12). Now that the ways in which humans con-
struct reality has been briefly addressed, the more specific
subject of frames and frame analysis is examined.
Defining Frames:
How Media Construct Reality
Frame analysis has its origins in sociology as well as media
theory. Erving Goffman (1974) wrote extensively on the
topic, and was one of the first sociologists to use frame anal-
ysis for explaining social phenomena. For Goffman, frames
refer to the definitions of a situation that are built up in accor-
dance with principles of organization, which govern social
events and our subjective involvement in them. Frame analy-
sis then refers to the examination of frames in terms of the
organization of experience (Goffman, 1974). Entman offers
another definition of frames:
To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and
make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way
as to promote a particular problem definition, causal
interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment
recommendation for the item described. (Entman, 1993, p. 52,
as quoted in McCombs & Ghanem, 2001, p. 70)
Frames help organize facts, and facts take on meaning by
being embedded in some larger system of meaning or frame
(Gamson et al., 1992). Frames provided references for the
public about what is important, and the media has great
power because of this.1 A basic proposition to this is that the
perceived salience of a public issue will be directly related to
the amount of coverage given to that issue by the mass media
(Holz & Wright, 1979). The following section gives a more
detailed account of the nuances among definitions of frames
and framing.
The Framing Tradition
Past work on framing has used assorted definitions.
Stephen D. Reese summarizes many of these definitions in
"Prologue--Framing Public Life: A Bridging Model for
Media Research" (Reese, Gandy, & Grant, 2001). For
example, in Entman's previous definition of framing,
frames are understood as those media images that focus on
one aspect of reality, elevating the importance of that real-
ity. Another definition of frames is provided by Tankard et
al. (1991): "A frame is a central organizing idea for news
content that supplies a context and suggests what the issue
is through the use of selection, emphasis, exclusion, and
elaboration" (Reese, 2001, p. 10). Iyengar (1991) and
Morley (1976) offer additional definitions of framing. For
Iyengar, framing encompasses subtle alterations in a state-
ment or a presentation of an issue, whereas Morley sees
frames as "the basic conceptual and ideological `frame-
work' through which events are presented and as a result of
which they come to be given one dominant/primary mean-
ing rather than another" (Reese, 2001, p. 10).
Other contributors to the understanding of framing
include Hall (1982), Gamson and Modigliani (1989),
Goffman (1974), Edelman (1993), Hertog and McLeod
(2001, 1995), Sieff (2003), Pan and Kosicki (1993), and
Gitlin (1980). Hall treats frames as any presented material
that sets a criterion for any future information; for example,
if an event is initially framed in a context, then any future
information regarding that event will be understood in the
way it was initially framed. Gamson and Modigliani define
frames as central organizing ideas that make sense of rele-
vant events (Reese, 2001). Goffman's work reveals how
frames classify phenomena, allowing the user to locate, per-
ceive, identify, and label a potentially infinite number of
occurrences (Reese, 2001). Edelman's conception of fram-
ing addresses how frames exert power in the way they are
classified and categorized. Hertog and McLeod see frames
as defining a context for an occurrence. Frames are used to
interpret events and allow one to determine what informa-
tion is useful or relevant for a situation. Sieff (2003) defines
frames as the means by which media information is orga-
nized, presented, and interpreted. Pan and Kosicki (1993)
view framing analysis as a constructivist approach to ana-
lyzing news discourse and practically functional dimen-
sions. News discourse is a "sociocognitive process that
involves sources, journalists, and audience members func-
tioning in a shared culture according to socially defined
roles" (Kosicki, 1993, p. 55).
Finally, Gitlin (1980) views frames as "the persistent pat-
terns of cognition, interpretation, and presentation, of selec-
tion, emphasis, and exclusion, by which symbol-handlers
routinely organize discourse" (p. 7). Gitlin emphasizes the
routine organization that transcends any given story and is
persistent over time, or any story that is resistant to change;
for example, journalists use frames to recognize them as
information and to assign them to "cognitive categories"
(Gitlin, 1980, p. 21; Reese, 2001, p. 11). For Gitlin, this
assignment to cognitive categories give frames a unique
power, which actively brings an otherwise amorphous reality
into a meaningful structure. This makes framing more than
the simple inclusion or exclusion of information--frames are
"active, information generating, as well as screening devices"
(Reese, 2001, p. 11).

These definitions for frames and framings vary in their
methodology and meaning. Perhaps the best definition for
framing is offered by Reese (2001). For Reese, framing is
concerned with the way "interests, communicators,
sources, and culture combine to yield coherent ways of
understanding the world, which are developed using all of
the available verbal and visual symbolic resources"; spe-
cifically, "frames are organizing principles that are socially
shared and persistent over time, that work symbolically to
meaningfully structure the social world" (Reese, 2001,
p. 11). The author addresses each aspect of this definition
systematically:
·
· Organizing: Framing varies in how successfully, com-
prehensively, or completely it organizes information.
·
· Principles: The frame is based on an abstract principle
and is not the same as the texts through which it mani-
fest itself.
·
· Shared: The frame must be shared on some level for it
to be significant and communicable.
·
· Persistent: The significance of frames lies in their
durability, their persistent, and routine use over time.
·
· Symbolically: The frame is revealed in symbolic
forms of expression.
·
· Structure: Frames organize by providing identifiable
patterns or structures, which can vary in their
complexity.
Reese's six aspects to framing are important to address in
detail to understand how frames emerge, persist, and affect
individuals and audiences. Because all previous definitions
of frames resonate more or less with Reese's definition, his
work will be the focus here. He provides one of the best,
systematic treatments of frames and framing effects.
The Organization of Frames. The initial question concerning a
frame is whether the frame is successful in accounting for the
social reality in which it represents. Frames can be organized
in numerous ways. The organization of frames can be exam-
ined in numerous ways as well. Two ways to address and
interpret fames are through cognition and culture:
Cognitively organized frames invite us to think about social
phenomena in a certain way, often by appealing to basic
psychological biases . . . "cultural" frames don't stop with
organizing one story, but invite us to marshal a cultural
understanding and keep on doing so beyond the immediate
information. These are the "strategic" frames that speak to a
broader way to account for social reality. (Reese, 2001, pp.
12-13)
Examinations of frames must address the scope of the
frame to determine how they organize, document, and
explain reality. Specifically, frames should be addressed with
the following questions in mind (Reese, 2001):
·
· In the representation of reality, how much framing is
occurring?
·
· How adequate is the frame to contain the elements it
proposes to embrace?
·
· How close is the frame to contain the elements it pro-
poses to embrace?
·
· How close is the frame to that promoted by sources or
indicated by an event?
·
· Is the frame convincing in accounting for reality?
Crucial to understanding how frames are organized is that
frames are more than just the sum of the parts in a particular
story. They add up to something bigger than an individual
story because reports of events are usually in reference to
previous or similar episodes. For example, a report on a bur-
glary is not likely to be framed as an isolated event. It has
potential to be linked to other burglaries or crime in general,
which potentially attaches new meanings to the event.
Therefore, frames can be organized around larger themes
that can influence the interpretation of individual events.
The Principles of Frames.Treating frames as "principles"
means that frames have abstract qualities: "Ultimately, frames
may best be viewed as an abstract principle, tool, or `sche-
mata' of interpretation that works through media texts to
structure social meaning" (Reese, 2001, p. 14). A frame may
represent a sort of taxonomy which provides general refer-
ences for specific manifestations or events. The abstract prin-
ciples allow the media and audiences to organize information.
While frames organize information, they are inevitably part
of a much larger set of structures (or social ideology) that
finds its emergence in the text. To ignore the principle that
gives rise to the frame is to take media texts at face value, and
to be misled by manifest content (Gitlin, 1980; Reese, 2001).
An important thing to keep in mind when addressing
media frames and interpretations of events is exactly what
constitutes something as an event. Events are socially con-
structed, and do not exist in a vacuum, so to speak. An occur-
rence must be first labeled as an event, and then such an event
can potentially be framed. This is a crucial point to consider
when examining media framing. After such occurrences are
defined as events, framing can further blur objective reality.
The abstract principles of framing are used by news media;
doing so shifts the objective occurrence into a subjective
event. Reese summarizes the abstraction of framing:
[A] frame is a moment in a chain of signification. As sources
promote "occurrences" into "events," as journalists define and
seek out information that fits their organizing ideas, frames can
help designate any number of moments when we can say that a
certain organizing principle was operating to shape reality.
These moments being fluid makes it risky for us to fix at one
point in time that happens to be most visible, such as in a news
story. (Reese, 2001, p. 15)
Carter 5
The Sharing of Frames. Frames structure reality, and they do
so with shared meaning. An event is interpreted by those
who witness it, and then conveyed to others in various forms
(pertaining to media, frames are shared through written,
visual, or auditory messages [or a combination of all three]).
Given the fact that frames are shared and that they must be
shared "in order to be useful and noteworthy organizing
devices," frames must be examined in terms of the degree to
which they are shared (Reese, 2001, p. 15). Addressing the
extent of how frames are communicated and shared between
people helps determine the nature of the frame. Frames can
be personal and idiosyncratic, social and shared, or cultural
(if the frames are broadly connected to many people; Reese,
2001). An example of this is provided by Neuman, Just, and
Crigler (1992) in a study that examined the shared meaning
of frames. What was found was that news media used differ-
ent frames than what audiences identified with--News
media generally used tactical frames (such as "conflict" and
"powerlessness"), whereas audience members "relied on
such frames as `human impact' and `moral values'" (Reese,
2001). Basic to understanding the connection of shared
meaning with regard to frames is that the acceptance and
sharing of a media frame depends on what understandings
the individual brings to the "text" to produce negotiated
meaning (Reese, 2001).
The Persistence of Frames.Frames are most influential
when they persist over time. The persistence, or ongoing
repetition of frames, creates meanings that are resistant to
change. If constantly inundated with information that is
framed in a specific way, an individual is likely to treat that
framed referent of reality as reality itself. By routinizing
frames, they become engrained in one's conscience as ref-
erence points. Future information concerning similar
events will be processed and compared with past events,
which are interpreted through frames. Information is fil-
tered by using past events that trigger conceptualization of
reality as it has been previously framed. The more persis-
tent the frame, the more the frame is used as a comparator
for new information:
Routinization suggests that a frame has a second-nature, well
entrenched, and built into the way of doing things . . . This
resistance to change, indicated by such a routine, suggests in
functional terms that we've stumbled upon a structure that is
satisfying some important need. The more persistent the
frame, the more likely it deserves examination. (Reese, 2001,
p. 16)
The Symbolic Nature of Frames. Frames work symbolically in
how they are manifested and communicated in their various
forms (Reese, 2001). The symbolism of frames is one of the
most important aspects to how frames operate. Much research
has been done that examines how symbols influence audi-
ences through framing techniques. Symbolism in framing is
likened to the metaphor of an iceberg; the obvious texts that
are visible are only part of the message conveyed through
frames (Reese, 2001). Content is only the tip of the iceberg,
symbolic representations are communicated at levels many
times far below the "surface."
By structuring frames within symbolic contexts, media
outlets exclude information that does not fit: "[T]he way we
emphasize symbolic content and handle its measurement
structures the conclusions we may reach about framing"
(Reese, 2001, p. 17). Viewpoints can be inferred by the fram-
ing of an issue. For example, Reese (2001) uses the abortion
debate to illustrate this point. Stories concerning abortion can
be couched as pro-life or pro-choice. Framing abortion as
such might define the themes to the audience as a dichoto-
mous issue, but there could be other perspectives. Reese
explains further how treating a story like abortion in this man-
ner can be problematic:
[One] might ask, for example, if a story is better characterized as
pro-life or pro-choice? This, however, may fix the terrain
prematurely--viewing news stories as neutral vessels, holding
various pro and con positions. But what were the choices
available for the story, what were the structured tendencies to
produce stories containing a balance of certain views? What
were the rules working to screen out particular perspectives?
(Reese, 2001, p. 17)
Such questions are important to pose when analyzing
frames and their symbolic representations.
The Structure of Framing.When media frame events, they
structure the social world. These structures involve patters
that emerge from any number of symbolic devices (Reese,
2001). When an issue is originally framed, patterns may not
exist. However, as media cover issues regarding the original
event thereafter, frames become dominant structures that
affect interpretation (examples of how frames gain in com-
plexity and coherence of structure over time are illustrated
later in this article). Gamson's (1992) work focuses on the
way that frame metaphors draw attention to subjects, that is,
how the principles of organization create coherent meanings
by "combining symbols, giving them relative emphasis, and
attaching them to larger cultural ideas" (Reese, 2001, p. 17).
Frames are embedded and complex, and are not conducive
for examination as single indicators. This is not to confuse
the ability to define the frame, which can vary from easy to
difficult depending on the subject, but rather to affirm that
frames are structural manifestations, which order the inter-
pretation of reality.
News media organize stories; frame structures
call attention to the internal organization within news stories . . .
By tacking the question of how meaning is structured, framing
relates closely to ideological analysis, but it places greater
emphasis on the nature of the organizing structures and how
they get established. (Reese, 2001, p. 19)
6 SAGE Open
To sum up the definitions and characteristics of frames
and framing devices, frames convey meanings that are orga-
nized, abstract (or principled), shared, usually persistent,
symbolic, and structured. Next, specific aspects of framing
are discussed as examined in the literature.
Rhetoric as Framing-in-Praxis
An additional aspect of framing regards rhetoric, both in
everyday interactions and in more structured organizational
domains. Rhetoric regards the manner in which one speaks
as a means of communication or persuasion. When one con-
siders the art of persuasion as a combination of context and
language, one can see that the art of rhetoric relies heavily on
framing. What elements are included in rhetoric--and just as
importantly what elements are excluded--serve to frame
arguments in specific ways and make some meanings more
salient than others.
Politicians learn early on the power of rhetoric in their
political strategies. How one frames a social issue can be the
sole determinant of how the public perceives the issue. For
example, gay marriage is a controversial issue that is cur-
rently being debated in public discourse. One can argue--
quite persuasively--for or against gay marriage. The way
one frames such an argument can greatly influence one's
response to that argument. By framing gay marriage as a
threat to the American family, one attaches a meaning struc-
ture that invokes specific emotions. To be "for gay marriage"
then becomes being "against America." On the other hand,
framing the opposition of gay marriage as a civil right infrac-
tion akin to discriminatory practices of America's past cre-
ates an entirely different persuasive stance. Denying one the
right of matrimony based on sexual orientation then labels
one a bigot. This example illustrates that framing can occur
in many different domains--even in the simple contexts of
everyday life. Rhetoric thus plays a key element in how
frames are defined in social environments. Frames are not
just visual: They are embedded in language itself.
Research and Literature
on Frames and Framing
Distortion
One aspect to how the media construct reality concerns the
distortion of events. Unless one holds an extremely postmod-
ern view about the nature of reality, events occur in an objec-
tive manner; when a dog bites a man, there is direct, causal
evidence that logically follows--A bite exists where it once
did not and the bite is the result of the dog attacking the man.
Such a common occurrence seems so simple that any inter-
pretation of the event apart from the dog biting the man in
temporal order seems improbable. Yet, it is important to
understand that the reporting of such events requires inter-
pretation, and interpretation can lead to misrepresentations
of objective reality. This becomes clearer for media outlets as
many times those reporting and broadcasting events are not
there to witness them. Accounts of the event are usually
taken from those involved, and those involved are likely to
have varying interpretations of what unfolded. Our simple
example of a dog biting a man can potentially be tricky
because of discordant interpretations. In addition, an account
and broadcast of such an event will only have the man's ver-
sion of the story; dogs cannot speak. One can see how such a
simple, trivial event can be misconstrued and presented sub-
jectively. Because of this, the presentation of events by the
media always risks distorting what really occurred.
David Altheide's (1976) work addresses media distortion.
For Altheide, "events become news when transformed by the
news perspective, and not because of their objective charac-
teristics" (p. 173). He cites the Watergate scandal as an
example of how the media can distort the meanings of events,
arguing that "Nixon fell from power because the news per-
spective transformed the series of events of Watergate into a
whole, which was then used as evidence of corruption and
immorality" (Altheide, 1976, p. 154). The Watergate events
occurred over time, and each breaking story built on previ-
ous ones. Altheide's point is to show the difficulty of con-
tinually presenting stories objectively as they build on one
another. An initial story about an event might be quite objec-
tive and accurately representative of reality, but as individual
stories emerge that attempt to explain a greater event, fram-
ing more and more becomes an aspect of news production.
Altheide does have critics, however. M. G. Dunn (1977)
claims that such representations of the media are irresponsi-
ble. For instance, framing the Watergate scandal as a moral
story in which the fabric of society is altered is not necessar-
ily a distortion of the events. The actions of those who par-
ticipated in the Watergate break-in and cover up were
operating immorally; therefore, media representation of the
events as immoral should not be problematic. Regardless of
the media's treatment of this specific example, the potential
of distorting events and misinterpreting information is
always a factor. The distortion of the truth is one way that
reality can be framed by the media.
Time
Time is an important aspect to understanding how media
(especially news media) construct reality. It is obvious that
media outlets work in a temporal setting in which deadlines
are common. It is not as obvious how such constraints influ-
ence the ways that media affects an audiences' perceptions.
Sociologists such as Emile Durkheim and Max Weber
addressed time as a contextual phenomenon. For Durkheim,
time is an objectified product--a result of social interaction
and social life rather than an a priori category; Weber
examined time as a crucial component in Western capital-
ism--a scarce commodity that represented earning potential
(Schlesinger, 1977). Both sociologists, while long gone,
Carter 7
offer insight on how the media shape reality. Because broad-
casts are limited by time and stories take time to develop and
present, media outlets filter and redefine the temporal sense
of what is real.
An example of this is provided by contemporary news
media. Immediacy is a premium for news outlets of all sorts;
television, radio, and print media all depend on the alacrity
of sources, reporters, camera teams, editors, and technicians
to produce stories. Philip Schlesinger (1977) provides an
insight to the importance and impact of immediacy:
It is clear that there is a systematic relationship between the time
concepts which comprise part of the newsman's occupational
knowledge and the demands created by the organization of
work. But the newsman's conception of time is more than just a
response to the constraints posed by the newsday production
cycle . . . Immediacy is to be measured as a true virtue.
(Schlesinger, 1977, pp. 348-349, emphasis added)
This mention of immediacy as a virtue is important to
understand how time influences newsmakers production of
reality. Time here becomes a goal; it is woven into the fabric
on the institution of news production. Because it is such a
premium, the types of stories and the way in which they are
presented are always within a temporal context. For televi-
sion and radio, stories are selected and drafted for presenta-
tion according to time slots. These time slots have been
standardized; television and radio allot time for hard news,
soft news, sports, market reports, and so on. Therefore, when
an audience is engaged in a media, broadcast reality is con-
structed based on time allocation of specific subjects.
Historical Context.A final aspect to how time affects the
social construction of reality deals with media and historical
context. More and more, news media operate in the present
and do not attach meaning to events as an effect of prior his-
torical causes:
News, as it emerges each day, and as it is conceived, stands in
radical opposition to history. Indeed, the system of newsday cycles
has a tendency to abolish historical awareness, creating a perpetual
series of foregrounds at the expense of depth and background. In
philosophical terms, we could argue that to be obsessed with a
particular duration (the day) has come to overburden the awareness
of sequence. (Schlesinger, 1977, p. 349)
Very little news occurs randomly or outside of historical
context, especially when considering national network news.
Nonetheless, because of time constraints, space limitations,
and other institutionalized boundaries specific to media,
events cannot always be contextualized sequentially.
Television, radio, and print media usually do not have the
time nor space to fully develop every story as part of a greater
context that has its place in history or other events. Because
of this, stories are framed apart from their whole, making
certain aspects more salient than others.
The Psychology of Framing
To this point, framing has been discussed as a media phe-
nomenon. However, frames and the effects of the media on
individuals vary. Framing plays the same role in analyzing
media discourse that schema does in cognitive psychology;
each is a central organizing principle that holds together and
gives coherence and meaning to a diverse array of symbols
(Gamson et al., 1992). Psychologically, frames maintain a
useful "tension" or "balance" between structure and agency
(framing bridges the gap between cognition and culture)--
events and experiences are framed, and we frame events and
experiences (Gamson et al., 1992; Goffman, 1974). Frames
and the media's construction of reality influence public opin-
ion, but to what extent? The following discussion examines
susceptibility and mechanisms that sway public opinion.
Frames are not to be linked or likened directly with sug-
gestion, or more specifically persuasion. Framing of events
is more subtle and involves a psychological component that
is removed from "message level" communication;
Frames are distinct not only at the message level but at the
psychological level as well . . . frames differ from other message
forms not just in their overt structure and substance but also in
the way the affect popular thinking about public affairs. (Nelson,
Oxley, & Clawson, 1997, p. 223)
Frames also work psychologically by generating more or
less cognitive responses from individuals concerning social
phenomena (Shah et al., 2004).
The way an event is framed by the media can be inter-
preted in various ways, specifically frames can be "episodic"
or "thematic" (Bullock, Fraser, & Williams, 2001; Iyengar,
1990; Nelson, Oxley, & Clawson, 1997). "Episodic" frames
focus on individual cases and encourage an audience to make
internal attributions for events (Nelson et al., 1997, p. 224).
For example, viewers presented with a news broadcast con-
cerning a societal issue such as the homeless will be inclined
to blame the problem on individual motivation. Homelessness
is interpreted as resulting from a lack of effort by people that
refuse to assimilate and work in the greater society. One the
other hand, "thematic" frames focus more on broader social
issues, such as social, political, and economic forces; these
frames encourage viewers to make external attributions
(Nelson et al., 1997, p. 225). Using the previous example,
homelessness in the context of a thematic frame would be
interpreted as resulting from forces in society much greater
than the individual. The homeless are not destitute because
of their lack of effort or unwillingness to work but rather
because of economic and political forces that suppress them.
Each of these framing techniques is a powerful mechanism
that influences viewers.
Framing and Belief Structures. A distinction needs to be made
about how the psychology of framing operates apart from
8 SAGE Open
persuasive messages and belief structures. Nelson et al.
(1997; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986;
Zaller, 1992, 1994) offer a description of how belief struc-
tures operate:
[T]he standard model of communication-based persuasion
typically involves a source who presents a message about an
attitude object to an audience. If the audience member both
understands and believes the message, and the message is
discrepant from his or her prior attitude, then the attitude should
change in the direction implied by the message. (Nelson et al.,
1997, p. 225)
Belief structures operate under the implicit assumption
that the audience is unaware of the content of the message.
Communicators that influence audiences are presenting new
information, that is, information that "contains positive or
negative information about the attitude object not already
part of the recipients'knowledge or belief structure" (Nelson
et al., 1997, p. 225). Framing effects are different in that they
are not connected to preexisting information; frames operate
by activating information that exists in the individual's
stocks of knowledge. The mechanism here is much more
subtle than persuasion. Persuasion techniques attempt to
shift an individual's opinion from one stance to another by
providing new information. Framing effects redefine opin-
ions or perceptions.
The power and interpretation of belief messages and
framing depends on the type of individual. People vary in
terms of their ability to accept or resist information as repre-
sentative of reality. This variance is a function of sophistica-
tion (Nelson et al., 1997). The more sophisticated an
individual, the less susceptible they are to being persuaded
by messages (messages likened to belief structures). For
example, moderately sophisticated people are more likely to
be persuaded because they are capable of receiving and com-
prehending messages, but may not have the ability to resist
the messages. On the other hand, sophisticated people can
generally receive and comprehend messages yet be unaf-
fected by the persuasion due to a greater ability to differenti-
ate the meaning of media messages (Nelson et al., 1997).
While the ability of the sophisticated to resist temptation is
seen as a function of belief structures, Nelson et al. (1997)
tested whether framing effects are similar, that is, whether an
individual's level of sophistication mattered when presented
with framed media information. The authors hypothesized
that sophistication would be irrelevant concerning framing
effects and the ways individuals interpret framed messages:
"[U]nlike standard persuasion models, framing effects do not
depend upon the recipient's acceptance of the message's
assertions . . . more- and less-sophisticated subjects do not
differ in their comprehension of framed messages" (Nelson
et al., 1997, pp. 227-228). Sophistication does not dampen
framing effects because framing operates by making particu-
lar considerations more salient. This salience in turn creates
a susceptibility to messages that are not more influential on
the unsophisticated, in fact potentially the opposite. The
more sophisticated may be more affected by framing because
such individuals are more likely to have preexisting knowl-
edge that is aligned with the content of the frame.
These aspects to framing reveal the psychological mecha-
nisms behind framing in ways that are perhaps counterintui-
tive. Nelson et al.'s work delineates how framing operates in
subtle, sometimes odd ways to shape elements of reality.
Aside from the psychological impact of frames, another
important dynamic to remember is that frames are communi-
cated through stories. Stories are simply narratives, which
are discussed in the following section, using deviance as an
example of how news stories frame the world.
Deviance: How Narratives
Create a World of Conflict
Journalists, reporters, and editors work together to produce
news. News production involves the delivery of information,
and information must be written before it can be transmitted.
Since the news is written, journalists are essentially telling
stories about what events occur. Such narrations are usually
framed in a certain context; they represent reality subjec-
tively rather than objectively. From this understanding, a
frame represents a storyline or "unfolding narrative" about
an issue; "Narratives are organizations of experience . . .
They bring order to events by making them something that
can be told about; they have power because make the world
make sense" (Gamson et al., 1992; Manoff, 1987). In socio-
logical terms, journalists tell stories within a narrative frame-
work that has salience in popular reality (Ericson, 1998;
Goffman, 1974; Hartley, 1996).
An example of how such narratives frame reality and
skew the objectivity of reality is found in the content of
news. By and large, many news stories tend to involve devi-
ance of some ilk. Crime stories are very common on televi-
sion and in print media; in fact, they are ubiquitous. It is
probably a safe assumption that most people do not experi-
ence crime in their lives proportionately to what is presented
on the nightly news or is written in daily newspapers. If one
doubts this assertion, then it is even more questionable
whether the audience who reads, watches, and listens to the
news experiences such ratio of crime and deviant behavior
(most people [specifically Americans] who are drawn to
print news and television news are more likely to live away
from locations where violent crimes commonly occur, for
example, Americans view images of war and terrorism daily
but rarely are confronted with them). Because of such an
emphasis on deviance in news stories, the news often frames
the world in a negative fashion. One's lens to the world, as
presented through the news media, is a filtered vision of con-
flict, violence, and instability. The similarities of ordinary
experience and narratives that shape reality are discordant.

Examples of Media Framing
Framing in Politics
There are many examples of how the media has framed
events in contexts other than reality. The incident where
Democratic candidate Howard Dean rallied an audience dur-
ing a campaign speech provides an example of media fram-
ing. Those in attendance during the rally were not moved in
the same way as those who viewed news coverage of the
event. The media framing of the event portrayed Dean as a
raving lunatic who incited the crowd to a maddening frenzy.
Television broadcasts focused in on Dean's face and torso,
and thus thematically set the tone of the event. Dean's
appearance on film was removed from others. The perspec-
tive of him in relation to the crowd created a much different
image for those watching on television. The impact of the
event was massive--Dean's on screen meltdown was the
image that lingered in people's minds, and will likely be part
of his legacy. The media had a major impact on how Dean
was presented, and the framing of the event was discordant
with the interpretation of those who witnessed it in person.
Another classic example of media framing is provided by
K. Lang and Lang (1953). As evident in the previous exam-
ple, public events are often interpreted differently by those in
attendance compared with those that view coverage on tele-
vision. "MacArthur Day" in Chicago offers a perfect exam-
ple of this. MacArthur's arrival was seen as a significant
event, and media coverage portrayed it as such. However, for
those in attendance, the impact of the event was discordant
with those that witnessed its coverage on television. A close
inspection of the event reveals how and why the discordance
occurred:
Examination of a public event by mass-observation and by
television revealed considerable discrepancy between these two
experiences. The contrast in perspectives points to three items
whose relevance in structuring a televised event can be inferred
from an analysis of the television content. (K. Lang & Lang,
1953, p. 10)
These three items included the following: (a) The arbi-
trary sequencing of the event structured the event in terms of
foreground and background. This created a technological
bias is the determination of what was important (from the
perspective of television personnel). (b) The structuring of
the event by an announcer greatly affected the perceptions of
those watching the event on television. Announcers' com-
mentary allows the viewer to maintain a particular perspec-
tive while images shift rapidly from scene to scene. Viewers
gain a stable orientation this way. Commentary in television
media is even more salient in contemporary news stories
because of the ultrarapid shifts of images common in today's
news broadcasts. (c) Reciprocal effects allowed the media to
modify the event itself by "staging it in a way to make it
more suitable for telecasting and creating among the actors
the consciousness of acting for a larger audience" (K. Lang
& Lang, 1953, p. 10). As the authors astutely noted about
MacArthur day, the event was transformed into a drama that
focused (or framed) specific aspects for the audience. The
media in this example presented the event as a drama that
was disconnected from the reality of those who experienced
it. Whether intentional or not, news media construct reality
by constituting an event as news (Duhe & Zoch, 1994; Lester,
1980; Tuchman, 1976).
The way the media affect public opinion about politics in
general is also interesting (Zaller, 1992, 1994). Recent
research has suggested that news media, by framing news in
negative ways, have influenced the general demeanor of the
public toward political issues and politics in general
(Cappella & Jamieson, 1996; Conrad, 1997).
Framing in Sports
Another example of media framing comes from sporting
events. Recent news on professional athletics provides
examples of media framing. The past decades have proven
turbulent for professional sports regarding players using ille-
gal substances. Various professional athletes have paid fines,
served suspensions, and served jail time for violating league
drug policies, ranging from banned substances (anabolic ste-
roids, growth hormones, etc.) to narcotics (illicit, controlled
substances such as cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs).
Recently, steroids and growth hormones have been the center
of many news stories concerning professional sports, specifi-
cally those related to Major League Baseball. The issue of
steroids and performance enhancing drugs has received so
much attention that even President GeorgeW. Bush addressed
it in a state of the union address. Bush proclaimed that the
time had come for professional sports to, once and for all,
clean up their act and make strides to eliminate the abuse of
steroids by athletes.
An interesting aspect to the reporting on steroids and ath-
letes that use steroids has been the way in which such stories
are framed. One way to interpret an athlete who uses steroids
is that he or she has broken the law--many steroids and
growth hormones are not only banned by professional sports
organizations but are illegal to possess, use, or distribute.
This interpretation frames the athlete who abuses such a sub-
stance as a criminal, one who has knowingly broken the law
by engaging in illegal activities. However, this is not the way
in which the media has framed the abuse of steroids. Athletes
are not usually arrested when they test positive for steroids or
are caught with them, as they might be if they possessed
amounts of marijuana or cocaine. Instead, such athletes are
reprimanded and disciplined by the commissioner in their
respective leagues. This fact greatly affects the way that the
media thematically frame steroid use. Such stories are placed
within a context apart from those that concern drug use and
abuse; athletes that are caught using steroids are not crimi-
nals, instead they are seen as disgracing themselves and the
10 SAGE Open
game in which they play. The latter aspect to this is what is
most interesting and reveals the power of media framing. A
very different interpretation is applied to such athletes'
behavior, one that places their action not at the individual
level but at the group level.
The framing of steroid use as affecting the "integrity of
the game" is ubiquitous in sports media. Such sound bytes
are often attached to such stories, and when new events occur
an audience understands it as a contamination of the purity of
the sport rather than as a criminal offense; this interpretation
is perpetuated by framing. Many news stories that relate to
sports are framed differently than stories concerning politics
or other themes. Using frame analysis reveals how events
can be defined in very different terms, even though they
might have similar elements and relate to similar aspects of
reality.
Framing and Health
Another example of media framing concerns reports of epi-
demics. When new illnesses are discovered, especially those
that are suspected of being caused by air-born viruses, they
are reported by mass media. Such reports tend to frame such
events in ways that create paranoia and great concern in the
general public. Specific examples of this include the media's
coverage of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)
breakout and the anthrax scare after the terrorist attacks on
the United States. Both events were newsworthy for obvious
reasons; each involved issues that are potentially relevant to
every human being on the planet and each had great imme-
diacy. Retrospectively, the attention given to each by U.S.
media was not proportional to the actual impact of the phe-
nomenon. Comparatively few people were affected by the
so-called outbreak of either anthrax or SARS, even though
each event was framed with the understanding that great dan-
ger was imminent. SARS was not the epidemic in which it
was framed, and less than 10 people died from anthrax in
America. The framing of these events is understandable;
they deal with the unknown. The interest here is that the
framing of such events creates an interpretation of reality.
After all, what has proven more dangerous, events such as
SARS and anthrax or other problems such as heart disease?
Heart disease kills many more people than did SARS or
anthrax, yet it is framed in a different way. It is interesting to
compare frames; doing so reveals how powerful the media is
in presenting certain aspects of reality. The importance of
events can be obscure or misplaced by the way that events
are framed and the context in which they are placed.
The Variance of Framing
Techniques Across Media
In concluding this discussion of the examples of media
framing, it is important to address how individual media
frame reality in distinctive ways. For example, newspapers
frame events in ways that are unique to print media. Stories
in newspapers are given precedence by their placement
within the paper. The more pressing, "important" stories are
usually placed at the top of each page, and the most pertinent
stories of the day are located on the front page. In addition,
readers are given cues that signify a story's importance; word
placement, font size, and color all provide references for a
story's level of impact and importance. These techniques
frame reality by providing cues and making certain types of
events more salient than others (e.g., war and conflict are
often salient visions of reality in print media).
Television frames reality in different ways. Televised
news broadcasts also involve narratives that tell stories, simi-
lar to the way that print media use texts, but television also
frames moving images. To understand this better, consider a
panoramic view of an ocean sunset. The image spans a great
distance from left to right, and also from top to bottom. If one
were to hold up an empty picture frame in front of them, the
image within the frame becomes far different from the origi-
nal. The setting sun may still be in the picture, but the dying
light and the emerging shadows that were on the far left and
right are removed. Only a segment of the whole picture is
revealed. This analogy works for framing on television.
Images are focused and cropped; they are chosen for empha-
sis and in doing so filter the complete picture from the audi-
ence. Therefore, framing in television broadcasts has the
added dynamic of image distortion. Such aspects of framing
apply to newspapers as well, as print media use still pictures
that are cropped to fit, but television is most characterized by
such framing effects due to the nature of the medium. These
dynamics must be considered to understand the devices
behind media framing.
Conclusion
This article has examined frames and media framing as
mechanisms of the social construction of reality. Marshal
McLuhan's famous aphorism, "the medium is the message"
may be a simplistic way of understanding the power of the
media in shaping an audience's perception of reality, but
"media" do present information that is framed, and therefore
the "messages" can be powerful and persuasive. In summing
up this discussion of framing, it is important to reiterate some
of the critical components of frame analysis and framing in
general.
The study of framing is concerned with how meanings are
transmitted across media. While frames are not always iden-
tifiable, and the power of their impact is debatable, frames do
make certain elements of stories more salient, and therefore
can potentially influence audiences (the level of impact for
salient portrayals of reality is also questionable however).
The media do have powerful impacts on social and political
issues; the salience of frames for these issues generally has
influence on public opinion. Frames that focus on interper-
sonal and personal agendas do not have the same impact;
Carter 11
media frames of this ilk do not have as great of an effect on
people. Therefore, while frames and framing can influence
the public, they are not to be understood as mechanisms of
unabated power.
Frames are embedded in culture, inside people's minds,
and within the agendas of the media. Frames are found in all
types of media, from print to broadcast news, and they con-
vey meaning through the interaction between the reader and
the text (these meanings are not in the text per se, but rather
already existent in the mind of the reader of the text). Frames
are socially shared, and therefore must have resonance for
both those producing a message and those receiving it. They
are (usually) persistent and perpetual. Implicit in understand-
ing how frames construct reality is that they leave out as
much or more than what they include. In other words, they
provide only a segment of objective reality. All frames then
are subjective interpretations, or emphases of reality.
This article has attempted to both review the literature on
framing and couch the literature in a few common themes.
Examples from the media, politics, and everyday life have
been provided that showcase how the framing process oper-
ates at different levels of analysis and in different social
domains. The examples also reveal the power of frames in
defining communications and as rhetorical, persuasive
devices. While frames and framing are mostly addressed by
academics who study communications, it behooves everyone
to understand the basic elements of framing. It is crucial now
more than ever for one to consider framing strategies used by
the media, as individuals in society more and more rely on
media outlets for information. By understanding the way
frames relate to the acquisition of knowledge, one can
become a more informed citizen and consumer.

Note
1. It should be mentioned that the power of media frames is debat-
able. Media frames tend to be more influential in some ways
than others. For example, frames that deal with public opinion
issues such as politics can be powerful, yet other frames such
as those that deal with personal agendas are less so.
