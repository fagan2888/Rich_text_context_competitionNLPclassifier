ABSTRACT
Background In spite of an elevated prevalence of trauma histories among prisoners,
there has been little research examining the relationship between incarceration and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); this is especially true for Black Americans.
Aims To examine relationships between PTSD and incarceration in a nationally rep-
resentative sample of Black Americans.
Methods We conducted analysis of data from the National Survey of American Life
sample of 5008 Black American adults in the USA. Multivariate logistic regression
analyses controlling for demographic factors including age, gender, home region and ed-
ucation were conducted to examine whether incarceration status was independently as-
sociated with PTSD.
Results Incarceration was significantly associated with trauma exposure, PTSD in the
12months prior to interview and lifetime PTSD, even while controlling for demographic
covariates.
Conclusions and implications for practice Incarceration, trauma exposure and
PTSD share a significant number of risk factors and co-vary frequently in some popu-
lations, including the one of Black Americans investigated in this study. Interventions
that can reduce shared risk factors for incarceration and PTSD and/or facilitate success-
ful treatment of the established condition have the potential to make a large positive im-
pact among incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people. Copyright © 2015 John

Introduction
It is recognised that people in prisons or jails are likely to have a higher
prevalence of the kind of trauma history that would put them at high risk
for developing some form of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Harlow,
1999; Brewin et al., 2000). Despite this, little research has applied epidemi-
ological techniques to understand when and how PTSD and incarceration
intersect (Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2014). Furthermore, the experience of
incarceration is unevenly distributed. Black Americans, for example, make
up 12.3% of the general US population, but they comprise 38% of state or
federal correctional institutional populations (West et al., 2010; Humes
et al., 2011). Black Americans often have difficulty accessing mental health
resources that are sensitive to and fulfil their clinical needs, and yet they
are an under-researched group in the field of psychology. Indeed, many Black
Americans have better access to mental health resources in jail than in their
home community (Youman et al., 2010). Many come from low income fam-
ilies and/or disadvantaged neighbourhoods, so they may be vulnerable to
trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD (Brewin et al., 2000; Gapen et al.,
2011). Thus, research on PTSD and incarceration may be particularly rele-
vant to better understanding of the mental health needs of Black Americans
and changing this situation.
Lifetime rates of trauma exposure are high in incarcerated populations,
although they may be disproportionately so in certain subgroups, such as
substance users (Messina and Grella, 2006; Carlson et al., 2010). Browne
and colleagues (1999) surveyed women arriving in prison, about half of
whom were African American, and found that 70% of the sample reported
having experienced severe physical violence and 59% sexual abuse before
the age of 18years, much higher than rates reported in national surveys in
the general population. Briere and Elliott (2003), for example, found that
just under a third of women in general report experiences consistent with
childhood sexual abuse. In custodial settings, further victimisation may oc-
cur; one state-wide epidemiological survey found that approximately 40%
of male and female prisoners had experienced sexual or physical violence
in the 6months prior to assessment while incarcerated (Wolff et al., 2007,
2008).
Although there is now plentiful evidence of high rates of psychopathology
among prisoners (Fazel and Seewald, 2012), there is little information available
on some specific disorders, PTSD among them. Goff et al. (2007), in their sys-
tematic review, found that of 103 studies identified pertaining to mental health,
only four examined PTSD; its prevalence ranged between 4% and 21%, but they
did not analyse social or ethnic subgroups.
Our aim, therefore, was to test for any relationship between PTSD and incar-
ceration in a nationally representative sample of Black Americans.

Method
Sample and procedures
We used data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) (Jackson
et al., 2004b). The NSAL was carried out as a supplement to the National
Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) to investigate racial, ethnic and cul-
tural influences on psychopathology and health; it includes incarceration data
only on Black Americans, limiting comparison to other racial groups. Black
American is the term adopted by the NSAL to encompass participants of African
descent currently living in the USA who self-designate their racial identity as
African American or Afro-Caribbean.
The sample was collected using the same four-stage area probability sampling
procedure used in other Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology (CPES) studies,
with data adjusted for oversampling, and household-level and person-level non-
response. Further explanation of recruitment strategies, materials and procedures
used in the CPES studies are described elsewhere (Heeringa et al., 2004; Jackson
et al., 2004a, 2004b; Pennell et al., 2004). Five thousand and eight Black
Americans were included in our analysis.
Measures
The NSAL diagnostic questionnaire was constructed from the World Health Or-
ganisation's expanded version of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view (CIDI), developed for the World Mental Health (WMH) Survey
Initiative following the structure of the NCS-R (Kessler and Üstün, 2004), using
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Diagnostic in-
terviews were conducted by trained lay interviewers using computer-assisted
technology with Blaise programming to accommodate the complicated diagnos-
tic algorithms and skip patterns. Prior versions of the WMH-CIDI have been
shown to have high concordance with blind clinical appraisals (Kessler et al.,
1998). These data were collected after incarceration at one single point in time
for each participant.
Potentially traumatic event history and posttraumatic stress disorder
The WHO-CIDI PTSD interview section assessed exposure to several different
DSM-IV-TR criterion A1 potentially traumatic events (PTEs), ranging from
combat to natural disasters, and asked respondents to indicate whether each
event occurred (yes/no); this tool does not include a frequency assessment. After
the trauma history was completed, participants were asked to identify the worst
PTE and presence or absence of PTSD symptoms specific to that event assessed.
In this interview, symptom assessment began with the most PTSD-specific
112 Anderson et al.

DOI: 10.1002/cbm
symptom cluster (i.e. cluster B, re-experiencing symptoms). Skip algorithms were
implemented after each cluster (B, C and D) so that if an individual did not meet
the threshold for any one cluster (i.e. only experienced one avoidance symptom
instead of the required three), the remaining symptom clusters and/or symptoms
were not assessed and presumed absent or missing. Although this approach is
efficient, it makes analyses of the full range of symptoms for any trauma deemed
upsetting enough to trigger the symptom assessment untenable. Information
about the PTE considered the worst or the only PTE identified was used along
with symptom ratings to generate diagnoses of PTSD. Neither past 12months
nor lifetime PTSD diagnoses necessarily correspond to presentation at the time
of interview. This interview assessment tool has adequate reliability
(kappa=0.75), but it underestimates interpersonal PTE exposure (Schlenger
et al., 2004).
To examine how the characteristics of the worst PTEs were related to incar-
ceration history and PTSD status, worst traumatic event was defined as a categor-
ical variable with two classes, primary traumas and secondary traumas; this
classification approach is similar to that used in prior epidemiological research
(Sledjeski et al., 2008; Pilver et al., 2011). Primary traumas occurred directly to
participants and comprised events such as physical assault and combat. Second-
ary traumas were those either witnessed by participants or the participant learned
that it had happened to someone close to them. Number of PTEs was defined as
an ordinal variable with four levels (no event; one event; two to four events; five
or more events).
Incarceration history
The incarceration questionnaire covered the number and length of time spent in
various incarceration settings (e.g. reform school, detention centre, jail and
prison). This questionnaire was piloted before being administered to Black
Americans in the NSAL study only, rather than all CPES study participants.
The incarceration section screening item asked, `Have you ever spent time in a
reform school, detention center, jail, or prison?' Because of conceptual differences
and low numbers of reform school and detention centre experiences (119), these
were excluded from analyses; thus, for this study, the binary incarceration
variable was defined as confinement in a jail or prison. Data on length of time in-
carcerated were not included because of lack of consistency and high rate of
missing data.
Demographic covariates
In line with previous research (Sledjeski et al., 2008; Pilver et al., 2011), demo-
graphic covariates included were as follows: gender, age (18­29; 30­39; 40­49;
50+years), educational level (any college vs others), household income
(0­19,999; 20,000­34,999; 35,000­69,999; 70,000+), region (west; northeast;
Midwest; south), urbanicity (urban vs rural), marital status (living as

if married/married vs single) and race/ethnicity (African American vs
Afro-Caribbean). Family member currently incarcerated was defined by its pres-
ence among first-degree relatives only.
Statistical procedures
Analyses were conducted using Taylor Series Linearisation with Statistical
Analysis Software-callable SUDAAN version 10 to estimate standard errors
(SEs) and confidence intervals (CIs) that may account for the design effects in
complex surveys. Weighted frequencies, adjusted to represent the US civilian
population, were computed to detail the demographic characteristics of the total
sample as well as by history of incarceration (Table 1). Statistical associations
with demographic characteristics by incarceration history status were tested using
Wald chi-square. Multiple logistic regression models were conducted to produce
adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs so as to examine the association be-
tween incarceration history and PTSD diagnosis (lifetime and past 12months);
all models were adjusted only for demographic variables significantly related to
incarceration at the bivariate level (p<0.05 in Table 1).
Results
Descriptive data
Five thousand and eight Black Americans were included in our analyses. Their
demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Respondents in the 30­39 age category were more likely to have prison expe-
rience compared with those in the 18­29 range. Respondents with no college ed-
ucation were more likely to have prison experience compared with those who did
have college experience. There was no significant difference between jail and
prison subgroups in age, education of PTSD, so we treated experience of incarcer-
ation as a single category in subsequent analyses.
Most people in the NSAL sample were African American (n=3570, 93.9%,
SE=0.5), female (n=3175, 55.6%, SE=0.8), educated to high school or less
(n=3817, 76.0%, SE=1.1), lower income (n=1892, 35.0%, SE=1.5), midwest-
ern (n=2748, 54.7%, SE=2.2), rural (n=2673, 54.1%, SE=1.4) and without a
family member currently incarcerated (n=4478, 88.9%, SE=0.9). Of the 5008
Black Americans in the sample, 566 (14.0%, SE=0.9) endorsed a history of in-
carceration, with 499 (10.0%, SE=0.9) indicating jail time and 105 (2.1%,
SE=0.3) indicating prison time. Three hundred and seventy-six men (22.5%,
SE=1.3) had been incarcerated compared with 190 women (7.2%, SE=0.8).
Table 1 confirms that, in the entire sample, African American ancestry, male
sex, middle age (30­39years), less education, lower income, urbanicity and hav-
ing an incarcerated family member were all significantly associated with a history

of incarceration. Consequently, all these variables were included in multivariate
analyses. African American respondents were more likely to have a history of in-
carceration than Afro-Caribbean (14.2% vs 10.5%; Wald 2 =5.04, p=0.03),
men more likely than women (22.5% vs 7.2%; Wald 2 =108.24,
p=<0.0001), middle aged (30­39years) more likely than young adults (
18­29years) (17.1% vs 12.9%; Wald 2 =4.45, p=0.01), those without a history
of any college education more likely than those with one (11.4% vs 22.34%;
Wald 2 =34.81, p=<0.001), those in the lowest income level more likely than
those in higher income levels (17.0% vs 10.1%; Wald 2 =9.98, p=<0.001),
those residing in urban areas more likely to experience incarceration than those
in more rural areas (15.4% vs 12.8%; Wald 2 =4.26, p=0.04) and those with an
incarcerated family member were more likely to experience incarceration than
those who had not (21.8% vs 13.2%; Wald 2 =9.52, p=<0.01).
Table 2 shows that the weighted prevalence estimate for lifetime PTSD
among Black Americans was 8.6% (n=400, SE=0.5). The weighted 12-month
prevalence estimate for PTSD among Black Americans was 3.6% (n=169,
SE=0.3).
Potentially traumatic episode history and posttraumatic stress disorder
Respondents with a history of incarceration had experienced a higher number of
PTEs than those with no history. Participants with a history of incarceration ex-
perienced an average of 5.15 (SD=3.51) PTEs, whereas those without such a his-
tory had experienced an average of 3.26 (SD=2.79) PTEs; adjusting for
demographic covariates, this difference was significant ( =1.68, SE=0.24,
p<0.001). In the entire sample, approximately 77% of the sample experienced
two or more PTEs (Table 2).
Multiple weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses, with incarceration
as the dependent variable and potentially traumatic incidents together with the
demographic variable highlighted as the independent variables, revealed that a
history of incarceration was significantly and independently associated with a va-
riety of PTEs (Table 3). Specifically, respondents with a history of incarceration
were more likely to have experiences of car accident (AOR, 1.9), man-made
disaster (AOR, 1.7), being beaten by a partner (AOR, 2.7), being beaten by an-
other person (AOR, 3.5), mugged (AOR, 2.4), raped (AOR, 2.1), sexually
assaulted (AOR, 1.7), stalked (AOR, 1.8), fought in combat (AOR, 1.7), to
have done something that killed someone (AOR, 3.0) or something that injured
someone (AOR, 3.1). Further, respondents with a history of incarceration were
more likely to have someone close to them experience a trauma (AOR, 1.8), wit-
ness a fight (AOR, 3.0) or witness another person seriously injured (AOR, 2.6).
Results from multiple weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses of the
likelihood of PTSD status, given incarceration history while controlling for de-
mographic factors, revealed that a history of incarceration was about twice as

incarceration history remained significantly associated with lifetime PTSD
(AOR, 1.73; CI, 1.17­2.57, p<0.05) but not PTSD confined to the 12months

Discussion
In this study of a nationally representative sample of Black Americans, we found
that not only had those with incarceration histories elevated rates of exposure to
potentially traumatic experiences, but also they were more likely to be suffering
with PTSD than their peers who had not been incarcerated. This relationship
remained significant even after adjusting for demographic covariates. This
elevated risk denotes significant mental health needs.
Although it is unclear what discrete risk is associated with each PTE, it is pos-
sible that the cumulative risk of these events comports vulnerability. Some of the
PTEs more likely to have been experienced in the incarcerated population would
also be those expected to occur within incarceration facilities; those with a his-
tory of incarceration, for example, were two to three times more likely to witness
another person seriously injured or physically beaten by another person and over
three times more likely to have done something that injured someone. Regardless
of the temporal relationship of PTEs, PTSD and incarceration, this indicates
need for trauma-specific services within this population.
Our findings suggest that formerly incarcerated Black Americans had twice
the likelihood of 12months and lifetime PTSD endorsement. Although other
literature on risk factors for PTSD suggests that demographic variables tend to
have small effects, in our study, a number of demographic variables were associ-
ated with incarceration status. Their influence was small--and controlled for in
final models, so in this sample, experience of incarceration was functionally
similar to the risk of experiencing a trauma sufficient to precipitate PTSD. This
relationship remained significant for lifetime PTSD even after controlling for
greater PTE exposure and demographic covariates, indicating it is likely incarcer-
ation itself that imparts a risk for developing PTSD. In other words, even com-
pared with persons with analogous trauma exposure and demographics, the
experience of incarceration increased the likelihood of meeting diagnostic
threshold for lifetime PTSD.
Our findings have broad implications for the criminal justice system and pub-
lic health, as they may mean that incarceration has the potential to have an im-
pact on the psychological health of detainees. Indeed, some research has shown
that men with PTSD who were incarcerated and released back in the community

were more likely to reoffend than men without PTSD (Kubiak, 2010). Thus, ef-
fective treatment for PTSD symptoms for those incarcerated in jails/prison is in
the best interest of the community and can be carried out successfully with cur-
rent evidence-based, trauma-focused programmes (Wolff et al., 2012).
Because of the cross-sectional nature of the data, we were not able to assess
the temporal relationship between PTEs, PTSD and incarceration, nor the effect
of length of time incarcerated. It would be fruitful to take a more longitudinal
perspective in future research. More specific questions might then also be an-
swered; for example, is it the inherent stress of incarceration, which includes lack
of autonomy and changed social relationships, or the increased risk of violence
during incarceration that most influences the likelihood of experiencing PTSD
among incarcerated individuals?
Limitations
The designers of NSAL included the incarceration survey as a first national test
of including this type of survey in a general population-based epidemiological
study, but they chose only to do so in one of the populations most affected by
incarceration--Black Americans. Thus, incarceration data were not available
for comparison from other ethnic or racial groups, so it is unclear whether the
increased prevalence of PTSD found among incarcerated persons may be lim-
ited to the repeatedly PTE-exposed members of the Black American community
rather than incarcerated persons in general. Regardless, results indicate that the
negative mental health consequences are prolonged. Indeed, this is in spite of
the lack of frequency data for the PTEs; therefore, this relationship may even
be underestimated. In addition, we may have underestimated these difficulties,
as Black Americans are more likely than other racial minorities to be currently
incarcerated or homeless; these two populations are excluded from national
household surveys, potentially biasing estimates of mental health disorders
(for information on this methodological issue in the NSAL, see Jackson et al.,
2004a). Finally, given the NSAL's PTSD assessment methods, discontinuing as-
sessment for PTSD once minimal criteria were met, the severity of DSM-IV-TR
PTSD symptoms could not be evaluated. This almost certainly means that the
severity of PTSD was underestimated in this sample, and limits comparisons
with DSM-5 estimates.
Conclusions
We found increased exposure to traumatic experiences and increased prevalence
of both past 12months and lifetime PTSD among Black Americans who had ever
experienced incarceration in jails and/or prisons. Black Americans who had been
incarcerated were at least twice as likely to have had PTSD as those who had not

been incarcerated, even after adjusting for demographic covariates and trauma
exposure. These findings indicate incarceration itself may impart risk for PTSD.
Taken in the context of prior literature, these results suggest a pronounced need
for comprehensive psychological services for Black Americans who have experi-
enced incarceration as well as for evidence-based trauma therapy for those cur-
rently incarcerated. Future research is recommended to investigate how
incarceration may precipitate, maintain and/or exacerbate PTSD among
prisoners.
