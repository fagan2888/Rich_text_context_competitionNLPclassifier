ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS
critical to the health of ado-
lescents and the well-being of
their families. Insurance can
play a crucial role in ensuring that ado-
lescents have access to the health care
they need. Analyses have shown that in-
sured children and adolescents as a
group are more likely to receive recom-
mendedpreventivevisits,havefewerun-
met health needs, and have a relation-
ship with a primary care physician than
their uninsured counterparts.1-7 In-
sured children and adolescents are also
less likely to go without medical atten-
tion when they have symptoms of a va-
riety of illnesses for which office visits
are warranted.5,7-9
The availability of health insurance
for children and adolescents has
changed dramatically during the last 2
decades. While there has been a de-
cline in the availability of private health
insurance, public insurance coverage
has grown rapidly, largely through 2
Congressional initiatives. First, begin-
ning in the mid-1980s, Congress en-
acted a series of Medicaid expansions
mandating states to gradually raise in-
come eligibility thresholds to the fed-
eral poverty level (FPL) for children and
adolescents. Second, in 1997, Con-
gress established the State Children's
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP),
which provides federal funding for
states to extend coverage to children
and adolescents from low-income fami-
lies through Medicaid or other insur-
ance programs.10
The Medicaid expansions have af-
fected eligibility for adolescents more
slowly than for younger children. The
early expansions exclusively ben-
efited infants and younger children. The
federal law enacted in 1990 required

Context Previous studies (1984-1995) of adolescent health insurance have shown
little change in the proportion with coverage. Federally mandated expansions in Med-
icaid were offset by declines in private coverage. Further expansions of Medicaid and
implementation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) have opened
new avenues for increasing coverage rates.
Objectives To assess the current health insurance status of adolescents, the demo-
graphic and socioeconomic correlates of insurance coverage, and document recent
changes in public and private coverage rates.
Design, Setting, and Participants We analyzed data on 12995 adolescents aged
10 to 18 years, who had been included in the 2002 National Health Interview Survey.
We conducted multivariate analyses to assess the independent association of age, sex,
race, poverty status, family structure, family size, and region on the likelihood of hav-
ing insurance coverage. Results are compared with previously published findings on
adolescent health insurance coverage spanning 1984 to 1995.
Main Outcome Measure Insurance coverage for adolescents.
Results An estimated 12.2% of adolescents were uninsured in 2002, which is a de-
crease from 14.1% in 1995 (P.003). The decrease occurred entirely because of an
expansion of public coverage and is concentrated among children in poor (100% of
the federal poverty level) and near-poor (100%-199% of the federal poverty level)
families. A substantial decrease in the differences between poor and higher-income
groups occurred between 1995 and 2002 due to gains in coverage for adolescents in
poor and near-poor families and losses in coverage among those in middle- and upper-
income families (200% of the federal poverty level). Specifically, the proportion of
adolescents in poor families without coverage declined from 27.4% in 1995 to 19.7%
in 2002 (P.001). The proportion of adolescents in near-poor families without cov-
erage declined from 24.8% in 1995 to 19.2% in 2002 (P.002). In contrast, the pro-
portion of adolescents in middle- and higher-income families without insurance in-
creased from 4.1% in 1995 to 6.3% in 2002 because availability of insurance through
the private market declined (P.001).
Conclusions A modest but significant reduction in the percentage of adolescents
without insurance has occurred since 1995, largely as a result of expansions in public
coverage. An even larger reduction in the proportion of adolescents without cover-
age would have occurred, if not for a reduction in private coverage for adolescents in
middle- and higher-income families.

states to phase in Medicaid coverage for
poor children born after September 30,
1983, so it was not until October 1,
2001, that all adolescents through age
18 years with family incomes up to
100% of the FPL were eligible.10-12 How-
ever, many states opted to extend cov-
erage for adolescents sooner than re-
quired. With the final phase-in of the
Medicaid expansions and implemen-
tation of SCHIP in the late 1990s, ado-
lescents' eligibility thresholds for pub-
lic insurance programs increased
substantially. By October 2001, when
federal law required states to extend
Medicaid eligibility to all adolescents
up to 100% of the FPL and 4 years af-
ter SCHIP was enacted, 38 states had
extended SCHIP or Medicaid eligibil-
ity to adolescents with family incomes
up to at least 200% of the FPL.13
These salutary developments in pub-
lic insurance have occurred alongside
reductions in the availability of pri-
vate insurance.14 The erosion of pri-
vate coverage appears to be the result
of several trends including large-scale
changes in the economy and em-
ployer benefit policies. Questions also
remain about the extent to which pub-
lic insurance expansions discourage
employer offerings of private cover-
age. The consequence is that even if
public insurance enrollment efforts are
successful, reductions in the overall size
of the uninsured adolescent popula-
tion may be small.15-20 In fact, by the
mid-1990s, expansions in public cov-
erage had succeeded only in offsetting
a decline in private coverage, result-
ing in no net change in the percentage
of uninsured adolescents aged 10 to 18
years between 1984 and 1995.5
In this article, we present new data
on the health insurance coverage char-
acteristics of adolescents aged 10 to 18
years from the 2002 National Health In-
terview Survey (NHIS). In the first sec-
tion, we assess the health insurance sta-
tus of adolescents and the demographic
and socioeconomic correlates of insur-
ance coverage. We then examine trends
in adolescent health care coverage be-
tween 1984 and 2002 by comparing our
new findings with those from previ-
ously published studies using the same
data source. Together, the results pro-
vide a current and comprehensive pro-
file of adolescent health insurance cov-
erage. The results also provide an initial
assessment of the effects of expanded
offerings of public insurance through
SCHIP as well as an assessment of
the extent to which declines in private
coverage have offset gains in public
coverage.
METHODS
Data Source
The NHIS is a continuing household
survey of the civilian noninstitutional-
ized population of the United States.21
The survey is sponsored by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics and
field operations are conducted by
trained personnel from the US Bureau
of the Census. We use results from our
previously published work based on the
1984,22 1989,23 and 19955 NHIS data
sets along with new analysis of data
from the 2002 NHIS.
The 2002 NHIS survey instrument
consisted of a core family question-
naire and supplemental question-
naires. We used data generated from the
family questionnaire for our analysis.
During 2002, the NHIS conducted field
interviews of 36831 families. Data were
collected for 13118 adolescents aged 10
to 18 years from 8604 families. A
knowledgeable adult member of the
family served as the respondent for ado-
lescents younger than age 17 years. Al-
though adolescents aged 17 or 18 years
were permitted to respond for them-
selves, only 229 did so. The house-
hold response rate for the 2002 NHIS
was 89.6%.
Description of Variables Used
Insurance Coverage. We used the ques-
tions on health insurance contained in
the family questionnaire to determine
insurance status for adolescents. Ado-
lescents in the sample were classified
as insured if they were reported to be
covered by Tricare (for active-duty mili-
tary personnel and their dependents),
Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, the In-
dian Health Service, other public assis-
tance programs, or private health in-
surance date. Adolescents with no
coverage from these sources were clas-
sified as uninsured. Adolescents with
unknown insurance status (n=123)
were excluded from the insurance com-
parisons. It should be noted that by de-
fining insurance status based on cov-
erage at the time of the interview, a
somewhat higher proportion of ado-
lescents are classified as insured in the
NHIS compared with surveys in which
a full year of coverage is used as the cri-
terion for establishing insurance sta-
tus. Although the wording of the NHIS
insurance questions has changed over
time, in part to accommodate new pro-
grams like SCHIP and Tricare, the ba-
sic concepts and approach remain the
same.
Poverty Status. Poverty status was
categorized into 3 groups: poor
(100% of the FPL), near poor (100%-
199% of the FPL), and middle and
higher income (200% of the FPL).
Adolescents with unknown poverty sta-
tus (n=3564) were excluded from the
insurance comparisons that included
poverty status as a covariate.
Statistical Analysis
Data analyses and statistical tests were
conducted using SUDAAN, a statisti-
cal analysis program that incorporates
the complex survey design used in the
NHIS, including household and intra-
familial clustering of sample observa-
tions.24 Estimates presented in the text
and tables have been statistically

tiontotals.Theweights,providedbythe

inverse of each sample person's sam-
pling probability, adjusted for nonre-
sponse. Cases with missing item infor-
mation were deleted from our analyses.
Most of our results are presented in the
form of simple bivariate comparisons
of insured and uninsured children and
adolescents. All comparisons between
groups in 2002 were conducted using
2 tests of significance; comparisons
between years were conducted using z
tests for differences in proportions.
However, we also conducted multivar-

RESULTS
Health Insurance Status
of Adolescents
Data from the NHIS indicate that 87.9%
of adolescents aged 10 through 18 years
had some kind of health insurance cov-
erage in 2002 (TABLE 1). Most of these
youth (65.1%) were covered by pri-
vate health insurance but a substantial
minority (21.5%) were covered through
public insurance plans such as Medic-
aid or SCHIP. A much smaller propor-
tion of adolescents (1.3%) had both pri-
vate and public insurance coverage. The
remaining 12.2% of adolescents had no
health insurance coverage at all.
Characteristics of Insured
and Uninsured Adolescents
Substantial differences in coverage were
found according to demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics of ado-
lescents and their families (Table 1).
Older adolescents (15-18 years) were
more likely to be uninsured than
younger adolescents (10-14 years)
(13.7% vs 11.0%; P.003), a differ-
ence primarily attributable to the higher
prevalence of public health insurance
among younger adolescents. Al-
though there was little difference in
health insurance coverage by sex, there
were significant differences according
to race and ethnicity. Black adoles-
cents were more likely than white ado-
lescents to have public coverage (39.1%
vs 15.1%; P.001) and also more likely
than white adolescents to be unin-
sured (12.0% vs 8.4%; P.001). His-
panic adolescents faced the greatest dis-
advantage; they were more than twice
as likely as blacks (27.7% vs 12.0%;
P.001) and more than 3 times more
likely than whites to be uninsured
(27.7% vs 8.4%; P.001).
There were large differences in cov-
erage related to poverty status of adoles-
cents (Table 1). Adolescents in families

with incomes at or above 200% of the
FPL were 4 times more likely than poor
adolescents to have private health insur-
ance (85.9% vs 20.7%; P.001), while
adolescents living below the FPL were
9 times more likely to have public health
insurance (58.3% vs 6.5%; P.001).
However, the greater likelihood of pub-
lichealthinsurancecoveragewasnotsuf-
ficient to offset the large gap in private
health insurance coverage, with the re-
sult that poor adolescents were 3 times
morelikelythantheircounterpartsabove
200%oftheFPLtobeuninsured(19.7%
vs 6.3%; P.001). The proportion of
adolescents in near-poor families with-
out insurance was similar with that of
adolescents in poor families.
Substantial differences in adoles-
cents' insurance status were found by
educational attainment of the family ref-
erence person (generally the father or
mother) and living arrangement (Table
1). Adolescents in families in which the
reference person had attained less than
a high school education were about 3
times more likely to be uninsured than
adolescents in families where the ref-
erence person had completed at least
some college level education (23.3% vs
7.0%; P.001). Adolescents living with
1 or neither parent were about half as
likely to be uninsured as adolescents liv-
ing with both parents (15.3% vs 10.6%;
P.001). Those living with both par-
ents were far more likely to have pri-
vate health insurance coverage than
adolescents living with 1 or neither par-
ent (74.7% vs 45.7%; P.001), but
much less likely to have public health
insurance coverage (13.7% vs 37.5%;
P.001).
There were some differences in cov-
erage by region of the country. Ado-
lescents living in the South were more
likely (15.1%) than adolescents living
in the Northeast (9.1%) or Midwest
(7.4%) to be without health insurance
coverage in 2002 (P.001 for both
comparisons). Adolescents living in the
West were also more likely (15.3%)
than adolescents in the Northeast
(9.1%) and Midwest (7.4%) to be un-
insured(P.001forbothcomparisons).
Multivariate Analysis of Predictors
of Insurance Coverage
Many of the demographic and socio-
economic variables presented in Table
1 are correlated, especially the socio-
economic status indicators such as pov-
erty status and educational attain-
ment. In addition, there are less obvious
correlations between some of the so-
cioeconomic and demographic vari-
ables. For example, incomes of 2-par-
ent families are generally higher than
those in single-parent families; conse-
quently, some of the differences shown
in Table 1 by family structure may be
explained by differences in family in-
come. To adjust for such confound-
ing, we conducted a multivariate analy-
sis of predictors of insurance coverage
among adolescents (TABLE 2).
A substantial degree of confounding
appears to be present as indicated by the
attenuated effect sizes in comparison
with the bivariate findings presented in
Table 1. Two significant differences in
our bivariate analysis, the black vs white

ference, became statistically insignifi-
cant.However,thekeyfindingsfromthe

NHIS,5 the largest changes between
1995 and 2002 are in the odds ratios
by poverty status. Relative to adoles-
cents in middle- and upper-income
families, the odds ratio for being unin-
sured declined from 6.84 to 2.26 for
adolescents in poor families and from
6.48 to 2.49 in near-poor families be-
tween 1995 and 2002. Hence, al-
though adolescents in poor and near-
poor families remain at substantially
increasedriskofbeinguninsured(Table
1), the relative risk of being unin-
sured has been reduced since 1995
(Table 2). The decrease in risk is due
to 2 factors: the decrease in the per-
centage of poor and near-poor adoles-
cents who were uninsured and the in-
crease in the percentage of middle- and
higher-income adolescents who were
uninsured. Specifically, the propor-
tion of adolescents in poor familes with-
out coverage declined from 27.4% in
1995 to 19.7% in 2002 (P.001). The
proportion of near-poor families with-
out coverage also declined (from 24.8%
in 19955 to 19.2% in 2002; P.002). In
contrast, the proportion of adoles-
cents in middle- and higher-income
familieswithoutinsuranceincreasedbe-
tween 19955 and 2002 from 4.1% to
6.3% (P.001), as availability of insur-
ance through the private market de-
clined. As a point of reference, the pro-
portion of all adolescents (including
those with unknown poverty status)
without coverage declined from 14.1%
to 12.2% between 1995 and 2002
(P.003).5
Trends in Adolescent Health
Insurance Coverage: 1984-2002
Trend data on adolescent health
insurance for 1984,22 1989,23 1995,5
and 2002 indicate that despite some
intermediate movement, the propor-
tion of adolescents without some type
of coverage remained essentially
unchanged between 1984 and 1995
(TABLE 3). By 2002, however, the pro-
portion with no insurance decreased
to 12.2% from a peak of 15.5% in
1989. Underlying this decline are sub-
stantial changes in the composition of
insurance coverage. Over the 18-year
period, the proportion of adolescents
with private insurance declined from
75.9% to 66.4% (including those with
dual private and public coverage),
while the proportion of those with
public coverage increased from 11.9%
to 22.8% (including those with dual
coverage). Hence, the substantial
decline in private insurance was more
than offset by an even larger increase
in public insurance, resulting in a
modest but significant decline in the
overall proportion of adolescents
without insurance between 1984 and
2002. Finally, while both younger and
older adolescents were subject to
losses of private health insurance
coverage, younger adolescents have
disproportionately benefited from
expanded public coverage.
COMMENT
Our results provide new information on
trends in health insurance coverage
amongadolescents.Substantialprogress
in expanding health insurance cover-
age among adolescents has occurred,
leading to an increase in the propor-
tion of the overall adolescent popula-
tion covered by insurance after a dozen
years of virtually no change. These gains
incoveragecameaboutentirelythrough
expansions of public coverage and are
concentratedamongadolescentsinlow-
income families.
However, substantial numbers of
adolescents from middle- and higher-
income families have lost coverage due
to a continued erosion of private in-
surance coverage. Experts have of-
fered a number of explanations for the
decline in availability of private insur-
ance coverage. First, some portion of
the decline appears to be attributable
to crowd out or the substitution of newly
available public coverage for existing
employer-based private coverage.25-27
However, the extent to which crowd out
explains the decline in private cover-
age remains unclear and controver-
sial. A recent review of literature indi-
cates crowd-out estimates range from
11% to 40% varying by data source,
methods, and definition of the control
group.27 Additional explanations for the
decline include the long-term shift of
jobs from manufacturing to the ser-
vice sector in which health insurance
is less likely to be offered as a fringe ben-
efit to employees and their depen-
dents; a shift on the part of employers
toward covering only employees and
not their dependents; a growing con-
tingency work force of temporary and

contract workers who do not receive
employer-based coverage; and higher
premiums due to increased medical
care costs.25,26,28-30 The current tepid
economy, combined with higher pre-
miums, is likely to result in a continu-
ation of the downward trend in the pro-
vision of private health insurance.
Our findings showing significant
improvements in coverage of adoles-
cents in low-income families are tem-
pered by the fact that these adoles-
cents continue to be at increased risk
of being uninsured relative to their
counterparts in middle- and higher-
income families. For example, adoles-
cents living in families with incomes
below twice the FPL were about 3 times
more likely to be uninsured than ado-
lescents in families with incomes above
twicetheFPLin2002.Hence,evenwith
full implementation of the federally
mandated Medicaid expansions and
withSCHIPprogramsoperatinginevery
state,largenumbersofadolescentsfrom
low-income families continue to be
uninsured. In fact, although adoles-
cents in poor and near-poor families
represented about one third of the ado-
lescent population, they accounted for
nearly two thirds of uninsured adoles-
cents in 2002.
Most of these uninsured adoles-
cents from low-income families are eli-
gible for either Medicaid or SCHIP.13,17
Aggressive enrollment and retention ef-
forts are required to fully realize the po-
tential of these programs. Adolescents
are a particularly challenging popula-
tion to attract, enroll, and retain.31
Newly eligible adolescents also may be
difficult to enroll because they tradi-
tionally have fewer contacts with health
care clinicians than younger children.
Moreover, SCHIP is still a relatively new
program. Even in a well-established
program like Medicaid, large numbers
of eligible children and adolescents fail
to enroll.32
Our findings indicate that sizable
regional differences exist in adoles-
cent health insurance coverage, with
the Western and Southern regions
lagging behind the Northeastern and
Midwestern regions of the country.
Although the regional differences
have shifted somewhat since 1995,
they demonstrate continuing prob-
lems of insurance access for adoles-
cents residing in the South and West.
The NHIS sample is not large enough
to examine state-level differences as
average, so we are limited in making
further comment.
There are 3 aspects of our data that
limit the precision of our estimates.
First, as indicated previously, 17- and
18-year-olds are permitted to respond
for themselves in the NHIS. Those self-
respondents may be less knowledge-
able about their health insurance
status than the adult respondents (prin-
cipally parents) who respond on be-
half of adolescents younger than age 17
years. However, any biases attribut-
able to self-reports are likely to be small
because the proportion of the sample
used in our study that responded for
themselves was less than 1.7%. Sec-
ond, although the NHIS is designed to
provide nationally representative esti-
mates, adolescents living outside of
households, including incarcerated,
homeless, and institutionalized adoles-
cents, are excluded from the survey.
Undocumented persons are treated no
differently than others, although their
response rates are likely to be lower
than for documented persons because
this is a government-sponsored sur-
vey. Third, about 28% of NHIS respon-
dents had missing values for poverty
status in the survey. For this reason, we
have not reported estimated numbers
of poor and nonpoor adolescents with
insurance coverage, but focused in-
stead on reporting proportions within
each poverty category with coverage.
In conclusion, this study has demon-
strated an overall reduction in the size
of the uninsured adolescent popula-
tion, with the gains being concentrated
withinthelow-incomepopulation.These
improvementsmaynotpersistifstateand
federaldeficitscontinuetoincrease.Cur-
rently, some states are cutting back their
Medicaid and SCHIP programs as state
budgets tighten due to increasing defi-
cits.33 President Bush's proposal to give
states greater power in setting rules for
Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility, if imple-
mented,couldleadtodecrementsincov-
erage. Given that the SCHIP and Medi-
caid expansions have accomplished one
of their primary goals--increasing cov-
erage for families in need--careful lon-
gitudinal monitoring of the effects of
changing policies is needed.
