Prevalence of Diabetes and Impaired Fasting Glucose
Levels Among US Adolescents
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002
Glen E. Duncan, PhD, RCEPSM
Objective: To determine the current prevalence of self-
reported diabetes and impaired fasting glucose levels
among US adolescents.
Design and Setting: Cross-sectional, National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002).
Participants: A sample of 4370 adolescents (aged 12-19
years) with self-reported diabetes and a subsample of 1496
adolescents without self-reported diabetes who had fasted
for at least 8 hours. Subjects who reported having diabe-
tes and using insulin were further categorized as having
type 1 diabetes, those reporting having diabetes and not
using insulin as having type 2 diabetes, and those with a
fasting plasma glucose level greater than or equal to 5.6
mmol/L (100 mg/dL) as having impaired fasting glucose
levels.
Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of self-
reported diabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and im-
paired fasting glucose levels among US adolescents.
Results: In the full sample, 0.5% (95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 0.24%-0.76%) of adolescents reported hav-
ing diabetes. Of those reporting diabetes, roughly 71%
(95% CI, 56%-86%) were categorized as having type 1
and 29% (95% CI, 14%-44%) as having type 2 diabetes.
In the subsample, roughly 11% (95% CI, 8%-14%) had
impaired fasting glucose levels. Using population-based
sample weights, these proportions were equivalent to
39 005 US adolescents with type 2 diabetes and 2 769 736
with impaired fasting glucose levels.
Conclusions: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and im-
paired fasting glucose levels is substantial among US ado-
lescents. These estimates have important implications for
public health because of the high rate of conversion from
impaired fasting glucose level to type 2 diabetes in adults
and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes.

THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF
the number of people in the
United States with diabe-
tes is 18.2 million, or 6.3%
of the population.1 This fig-
ure includes 13 million people with diag-
nosed diabetes and 5.2 million with un-
diagnosed diabetes. About 210 000 people
younger than 20 years have diabetes, and
approximately 1 in every 400 to 500 chil-
dren and adolescents has type 1 diabe-
tes.1 Although type 2 diabetes is an emerg-
ing problem among youth,2-5 nationally
representative data to monitor diabetes
trends in this age group are not available.
In the only population-based study of
diabetes among US adolescents (aged
12-19 years) to date,6 the prevalence of dia-
betes was estimated at 0.41% between 1988
and 1994. Although the presence of type
2 diabetes was reported, the survey sample
size was not large enough to obtain pre-
cise prevalence estimates because of the
relatively low prevalence at the time of the
survey. More recent reports indicate that
impaired glucose tolerance is highly preva-
lent among overweight youth,7 and that
prediabetes in youth is associated with al-
tered fat partitioning in muscle and intra-
abdominal regions and the development
of severe peripheral insulin resistance.8
Similarly, the metabolic syndrome is
common among US adolescents9-11 and
has increased significantly over the past
decade.10
Because the prevalence of being over-
weight has continued to increase substan-
tially over the past several decades among
US children and adolescents,12,13 it is also
likely that the prevalence of diabetes has
increased among these youths. Further

supporting this contention, a recent report indicates that
the lifetime probability of being diagnosed with diabe-
tes is substantial for individuals born in the United States
in the year 2000.14 The objective of this article is to pre-
sent the most recent national estimates for the preva-
lence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose levels
among US adolescents, based on data from the 1999-
2000 and 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Surveys (NHANES).
METHODS
The NHANES design is a stratified, multistage probability sample
of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population. Approxi-
mately 9965 persons aged 2 months to 85 years were studied
in the NHANES 1999-2000 survey period, and 11 039 in the
2001-2002 survey period. A subsample of more than 3000 in-
dividuals from each survey was invited to attend a morning ex-
amination after fasting overnight. Fully informed consent and
assent were obtained from all participants and these docu-
ments were approved by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistic's Institutional Review Board.
Details of the NHANES protocol are available elsewhere.15
Briefly, blood specimens were stored frozen until they were
shipped to a central laboratory for analysis. Plasma glucose lev-
els were measured with an enzymatic technique using the hexo-
kinase/glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase reaction. Whole-
blood hemoglobin A1c
levels were measured using fully
automated glycohemoglobin analyzers (CLC330 and CLC385;
Primus Corp, Kansas City, Mo) and boromate affinity high-
performance liquid chromatography, serum insulin levels were
measured using a double-antibody radioimmunoassay tech-
nique, and serum C-peptide levels were measured using a poly-
ethylene glycol­accelerated double-antibody technique. Height
was measured in an upright position with a stadiometer and
weight was also measured in a standing position on a self-
zeroing scale. The poverty-to-income ratio, a ratio of family in-
come to poverty thresholds established by the US Census Bu-
reau, was used as a measure of socioeconomic status.
Data from each survey were linked using a unique survey
participant identifier. The full sample consisted of 4370 ado-
lescents (aged 12-19 years) who were given a personal inter-
view on diabetes, including use of medications and symptoms
associated with diabetes. All subjects were asked the lead-in
question pertaining to history of diabetes: "Have you ever been
told by a doctor or health professional that you have diabetes
or sugar diabetes?" Subjects with a missing response (n=1) or
those who responded "borderline" (n=1) were excluded from
the analyses. Thus, the only possible responses were "yes" or
"no." Pregnant women (n=101) and subjects categorized as
"other Hispanics" (n=231) and "other races, including multi-
racial" (n=202) were also excluded from the analyses, the lat-
ter because of inadequate sample sizes for these groups. The
subsample consisted of 1496 adolescents with a fasting ( 8
hours) glucose value recorded and who responded "no" to the
lead-in question on diabetes history. Only subjects who had
complete data were included in the subsample analyses.
DEFINITIONS
In the full sample, subjects who responded "yes" to the lead-in
question were further categorized by specific diabetes type. Those
who reported using insulin were categorized as having type 1
diabetes, and those who reported not using insulin as having
type 2 diabetes. Subjects in the subsample with a fasting glu-
cose level of less than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) were catego-
rized as having normal fasting glucose levels, and those with a
value greater than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) as hav-
ing impaired fasting glucose levels.16 Using the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention growth charts for the United States
in the year 2000, being overweight among adolescents was de-
fined as having a body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of greater
than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex; at risk for
being overweight was defined as having a BMI value greater than
or equal to the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percen-
tile for age and sex; and normal weight was defined as having
a BMI of less than the 85th percentile for age and sex.17
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using SAS statistical software (version 9.1;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The full sample was analyzed us-
ing the 4-year full sample interview weights to estimate means
and95%confidenceintervals(CIs),andthemaskedvarianceunits
(pseudoprimary and pseudostratum sampling units) to estimate
the standard error of those means. The subsample was analyzed
using the 4-year fasting weights and the masked variance units.
Continuousvariablesarepresentedasmean±SE.Categoricalvari-
ables are presented as frequency, weighted frequency (based on
sampling weights), and proportion with 95% CI. All propor-
tions are based on a percentage of the weighted frequencies. Dif-
ferences in continuous variables were tested univariately using t
tests for independent samples, and prevalence values for categori-
cal variables were compared using 2 tests for proportions.
Statistical significance was established at =.05 a priori.
RESULTS
The full sample included 4370 subjects, equivalent to a
weighted sample of 26 649 401 adolescents, with mean
age of 15.4±0.1 years. The sex distribution was roughly
48% female and 52% male, and the race distribution was
12.8% Mexican American, 16.6% non-Hispanic black, and
70.6% non-Hispanic white. The percentage of self-
reported diabetes in the total sample and self-reported
diabetes by sex and race are presented in Table 1. There
was no difference (P=.94) in age among subjects report-
ing "yes" for having diabetes (15.4±0.6 years) or "no"
to the lead-in question on diabetes history (15.4±0.1
years). There was a significant association between self-
reported diabetes and sex, and between self-reported dia-
betes and race (P.001).
The percentage of diabetes type in the overall sample
and the percentage of diabetes by sex and race are pre-
sented in Table 2. There was no difference (P=.34) in
age among subjects categorized as having type 1 (15.8±0.6
years) or type 2 (14.5±0.0 years) diabetes. Among sub-
jects categorized as having type 1 diabetes (n=10; esti-
mate=95066), 5.9% also reported taking oral agents (n=2;
estimate=5635). Among subjects categorized as having
type 2 diabetes (n=8; estimate=39 005), 31.3% re-
ported taking oral agents (n=1; estimate=12 205). There
was a significant association between diabetes type and
sex, and between diabetes type and race (P.001).
The subsample included 1496 subjects, equivalent to
a weighted sample of 24 885 638 adolescents, with a mean
age of 15.4±0.1 years. The sex distribution was roughly
49% female and 51% male and the race distribution was
11.6% Mexican American, 15.3% non-Hispanic black, and

in the subsample (by fasting glucose level group and by
sex and race) is presented in Table 3. Age was not dif-
ferent (P=.83) among subjects having normal (15.4±0.1
years) and impaired (15.4±0.3 years) fasting glucose lev-
els. There was a significant association between fasting
glucose group and sex, and between fasting glucose group
and race (P.001).

Demographic and clinical measures for the subjects
in the subsample are presented in Table 4. Fasting glu-
cose, hemoglobin A1c
, insulin, and C-peptide levels were
significantly different (P.01) between groups, whereas
BMI and the poverty-to-income ratio were not different
between groups (P.05). There was a significant asso-
ciation (P.001) between the fasting glucose group and
BMI status, expressed as a percentile for age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS
This study provides the most recent national estimates
of the prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glu-
cose levels among US adolescents. Eighteen subjects in
the full sample had self-reported diabetes. Using popu-
lation-based sample weights, this was equivalent to
134 071 US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years with self-
reported diabetes, or 0.5% of all people in this age group.
This estimate is reasonable and consistent with the es-
timate that 206 000 (0.25%) people younger than 20 years
have diagnosed diabetes, as reported elsewhere.1
The absolute percentage of self-reported diabetes was
higher among boys than girls (eg, 54% vs 46%, respec-
tively), and among non-Hispanic white youth than non-
Hispanic black and Mexican American youth. This pat-
tern was consistent when self-reported diabetes was
expressed as a function of the number of individuals in a
given sex or race with diabetes by the total number of
individuals of that sex or race in the population. For
example, about 0.53% of all adolescent boys in the popu-
lation had self-reported diabetes (73 011 cases of self-
reported diabetes among boys divided by 13 894 184 boys
in the population), compared with about 0.48% of all ado-
lescent girls in the population. Similarly, about 0.56% of
all non-Hispanic white youth in the population had self-
reported diabetes (104 907 cases of self-reported diabetes
among non-Hispanic white youth divided by 18 805 881
non-Hispanicwhiteyouthinthepopulation)comparedwith
0.42% of all non-Hispanic black and 0.31% of all Mexican
American adolescents in the population. These percent-
agesaredifferentamongadults(20years),wherethetotal
prevalence of diabetes by race/ethnicity is highest among
non-Hispanic black adults (11.4%), followed by non-
Hispanic white (8.4%) and Hispanic/Latino adults (8.2%).1
By examining information on self-reported diabetes
and medication use, subjects were further categorized as
having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In this analysis, 10 sub-
jects with self-reported diabetes were categorized as hav-
ing type 1 diabetes, whereas 8 subjects were categorized
as having type 2 diabetes. Using population-based sample
weights, this was equivalent to 95 066 adolescents with
type 1 diabetes and 39 005 adolescents with type 2 dia-
betes. Thus, among the US adolescents in the popula-
tion who have diabetes, 71% have type 1 diabetes and
29% have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was once a
condition only seen in adults, but this study provides evi-
dence to support recent clinic-based reports and re-
gional studies2,3,5,18 that point to an emerging problem of
type 2 diabetes among US youth.
The absolute percentage of type 1 diabetes was higher
among boys than girls, while the absolute percentage of
type 2 diabetes was higher among girls than boys. About
78% of all adolescent boys in the population with self-
reported diabetes had type 1 diabetes (56 743 cases of type
1 diabetes among boys divided by 73011 boys in the popu-
lation with self-reported diabetes), and 22% of all ado-
lescent boys in the population with self-reported diabe-
tes had type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, 63% of all

adolescent girls in the population with self-reported dia-
betes had type 1 diabetes and 37% had type 2 diabetes.
The absolute percentage of type 1 and type 2 diabetes was
higher among non-Hispanic white than non-Hispanic
black and Mexican American youth. About 76% of all non-
Hispanic white youth in the population with self-
reported diabetes had type 1 diabetes (79 477 cases of type
1 diabetes among non-Hispanic white youth divided by
104 907 non-Hispanic youth in the population with self-
reported diabetes), and 24% of all non-Hispanic white
adolescents in the population with self-reported diabe-
tes had type 2 diabetes. This is in contrast to 62% of all
non-Hispanic black youth in the population with self-
reported diabetes having type 1 diabetes and 38% hav-
ing type 2 diabetes, and 37% of all Mexican American
youth in the population with self-reported diabetes hav-
ing type 1 diabetes and 63% having type 2 diabetes. Thus,
the relative percentage of type 2 diabetes is highest among
Mexican American adolescents, followed by non-
Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white adolescents.
There were 178 subjects in the subsample who had im-
pairedfastingglucoselevels.Usingpopulation-basedsample
weights, this was equivalent to 2 769 736 US adolescents
with impaired fasting glucose levels, or about 11% of all
people in this age group. The number of adolescents with
impaired fasting glucose levels in this study is about 9 per-
centage points higher than previously reported (1.76%).6
However, at the time of that report the cut-point value for
defining impaired fasting glucose levels was 6.1 mmol/L
(110mg/dL).Themuchhigherprevalenceofimpairedfast-
ing glucose levels in this study was entirely a result of the
lowered cut-point value. There were only 24 subjects in
thesubsamplewhohadimpairedfastingglucoselevelswhen
using a value of 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). This was equiva-
lent to 379 729 US adolescents with impaired fasting glu-
cose levels, or about 1.5% (95% CI, 0.82-2.23) of all people
in this age group. Sinha et al7 found that 21% of over-
weight adolescents aged 11 to 18 years had impaired glu-
cose tolerance. However, it is important to note that their
subjects were at high risk for diabetes, impaired fasting glu-
cose levels, and/or impaired glucose tolerance as the en-
tire sample had a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for
age and sex. Although BMI was not different between the
normalandimpairedfastingglucoselevelgroupsinthepres-
ent study when expressed on an absolute basis (ie, 22.8 vs
23.9, respectively), more than 15% of all adolescents with
impaired fasting glucose levels were overweight (661 891
cases of impaired fasting glucose levels among overweight
adolescents divided by 4 342 742 overweight adolescents
in the population) compared with 14.1% who were at risk
for being overweight and 9.5% who were normal weight.
Thiswasalsothecasewhenacut-pointvalueof6.1mmol/L
(110 mg/dL) was used; roughly 2.4% of overweight or at
risk for being overweight adolescents had impaired fast-
ing glucose levels compared with 1.1% of normal-weight
youth.Thus,impairedfastingglucoselevelsweremorecom-

tribution of impaired fasting glucose levels as a function
of BMI percentile is shown in the Figure.
Impaired fasting glucose levels were more common
in boys than girls (14.8% of all boys in the population vs
7.3% of all girls in the population). In contrast, Fagot-
Campagna et al6 reported that slightly more girls than
boys had impaired fasting glucose levels. Impaired fast-
ing glucose levels were more common among Mexican
American adolescents at 15.3% (439 035 cases of im-
paired fasting glucose levels among Mexican American
adolescents divided by 2 877 893 Mexican American ado-
lescents in the population) compared with 11.3% of all
non-Hispanic white and 7.4% of all non-Hispanic black
adolescents. These data are consistent with a previous
report1 demonstrating large differences in the preva-
lence of impaired fasting glucose levels among the
major race groups.
As expected, there were differences in several physi-
ologic measures of glucose metabolism between adoles-
cents categorized as having normal or impaired fasting glu-
cose levels. By definition (as previously mentioned in the
"Methods" section), fasting plasma glucose would have to
be different between groups; levels were about 5.0 mmol/L
(90 mg/dL) in those with normal fasting glucose levels and
5.8 mmol/L (105 mg/dL) in those with impaired fasting
glucoselevels.Fastingplasmainsulinlevelswerealsohigher
in subjects with impaired vs normal fasting glucose lev-
els. This is consistent with the findings of Weiss et al8 who
found significantly higher fasting insulin levels in young
subjects with impaired glucose tolerance compared with
matched youth with normal glucose tolerance. The im-
paired glucose tolerance group in that study also exhib-
ited marked insulin resistance (measured by the glucose

reported history of diabetes in a small number of sub-
jects (n=18). The sample weights used to calculate popu-
lation totals in the current NHANES are based on
population estimates that incorporate the US Census Bu-
reau counts from the year 2000. The population esti-
mate for US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the full
sample was 26 649 401 based on sample weights ap-
plied to 4370 subjects. Although this population esti-
mate is lower than the actual population of US adoles-
cents (aged 12-19 years), which is about 32 012 573 based
on the monthly postcensal civilian noninstitutional popu-
lation (April 1, 2000, to June 1, 2000), the population
in this study was estimated after applying several exclu-
sion criteria. Using all subjects (aged 12-19 years) in the
current NHANES without applying the exclusion crite-
ria gives a sample of 4902 adolescents, equivalent to a
population of 32 113 578. Thus, the population of US ado-
lescents in this study is quite reasonable and consistent
with US Census data. Likewise, the population estimate
of diabetes prevalence among US adolescents provided
in this study (134 071 or 0.5% of all people in this age
group) also appears quite reasonable, as evidenced by the
report discussed previously1 where it was estimated that
206 000 (0.25%) people younger than 20 years have
diagnosed diabetes.
Similar to this limitation, the classification of sub-
jects into a specific type of diabetes was also based on
self-reported use (or nonuse) of insulin, which was not
optimal. However, this was the best method of doing so
based on the available data in the current NHANES. It
has been proposed that approximately 1 in every 400 to
500 children and adolescents younger than 20 years has
type 1 diabetes.1 Based on the results of the present study,
approximately 1 in every 338 adolescents aged 12 to 19
years has type 1 diabetes and 1 in every 823 has type 2
diabetes. Thus, type 1 diabetes remains the major con-
tributor to the diagnosis of diabetes in a pediatric popu-
lation. Finally, the classification of and prevalence esti-
mate for impaired fasting glucose levels were determined
from one measurement. Although only subjects who had
fasted for at least 8 hours were included in this analysis,
confirmation of these findings may require an addi-
tional fasting blood draw and/or an oral glucose toler-
ance test. Despite these limitations, this study does pro-
vide evidence that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and
impaired fasting glucose level is substantial among US
adolescents. These findings have important implica-
tions for public health because of the high rate of con-
version from impaired fasting glucose level to type 2 dia-
betes in adults, and the increased risk of cardiovascular
disease among adults with type 2 diabetes. These data
provide a compelling rationale for prevention of diabe-
tes and impaired fasting glucose levels among adoles-
cents in the US population.
