Differences in Reported Food Frequency by Season of Questionnaire Administration: The  1987 National Health Interview Survey
Amy F. Subar,1 Carolin M. Frey,2 Linda C. Harlan,1 and Lisa Kah le 3



We assessed seasonal reporting bias in a 59-item food fre­ quency questionnaire (F FQ) administered throughout 1 year using data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey (N = 20,143 adults). Few meaningful differences were found in the proportion of individuals reporting rarely or never consum ing a food by season of questionnaire administration . Seasonal reporting bias is evident in FFQs, however, and appears to be due to reporting most recent consumption . Using gender-specific median servings per week, an analysis using logistic regression showed that the estimated propor ­ tion of individuals reporting food intake at greater than the yearly median differed between any two seasons by at least

5 % of the population for 22 foods. We compared gender­ specific quintiles of selected nutrients / food groups for the whole year and each season; these showed that quintile assignment never varied by more than one adjacent quintile . The most frequent shift in quintile assignment, involving as many as 18.5 % of women in the summer, occurred for citrus fruits. The intake biases are small and do not greatly affect population estimates if the FFQ is adm inistered in all seasons, but they may somewhat affect classification of individuals into quantiles for some foods/nutrients.

Food frequency questionnaires are commonly used in research addressing questions related to diet and dis­ ease outcome. Such questionnaires are favored among epidemiologic investigators because they strive to eval­ uate an individual's usual diet over an extended period with a single questionnaire administered on one occa­ sion. Other methods , such as 24-hour recalls or diet records , are more expensive and require multiple days of recording to fairly represent typical dietary intake.1 8 Methods have been developed for estimating nutrient intake from food frequency questionnaires, thus allow­


trient intake from food frequency questionnaires to reference record data has produced correlation coeffi­ cients that range from 0.5 to 0.8 for macronutrients , vitamins, and minerals.11
  Although food and nutrient intake varies by sea­ son,6 ·12·1 3  food  frequency  questionnaires are often  de­ signed to collect intake data averaged over all seasons. An individual is queried to recall the usual number of times in the past year food items were consumed per day, week, month, or year. Some frequency-type ques­ tionnaires are specifically designed to query seasonal

ing investigators to calculate both food group and

intake of foods.12 1

that when individuals were asked to specify frequency of intake of fruits and vegetables by season, such foods were recalled similarly for interviews administered in all four seasons. Past research has shown that individ­ uals' responses with respect to past diet are strongly influenced by their most current diet.18 26 To investi ­ gate seasonal reporting bias, we used data from a 59-item food frequency questionnaire administered during the course of 1 year to a large, nationally representative sample in the 1987 National Health Interview Survey.

REPORTED FOOD INTAKE BY SEASON



involved year -round data collection from a total sample of 44,123 nationally representative U.S. households .27 In-home interviews of noninstitutionalized individuals were conducted by experienced Census Bureau inter­ viewers. For respondents not found at home after repeated visits, interviews were obtained by telephone whenever possible (approximately 16% ). After enu­ meration of all adults in a household, one randomly selected adult age 18 or older was given either a Cancer Control or Epidemiology questionnaire. The entire interview lasted approximately l}-2 hours, and the dietary interview portion (contained in the Epidemiol­ ogy questionnaire) lasted an average of 17 minutes.
  The dietary interview, consisting of a 59-item food frequency questionnaire developed by Block et al, 28 was administered one time per respondent to 22,080 adults. Individuals were asked to report the usual number of times per day, week, month, or year food items were consumed over the past year, and approxi­ mate portion size (small, medium, or large). The 59 food items in the questionnaire were selected to in­ clude foods that are the major contributors of nutrients in the diet based on analyses of nutrient sources29·30 from 24-hour dietary recall data collected in the Na­ tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES II) from 1976 to 1980.31 Reported frequen­ cies of less than six times per year were coded as zero. Nutrient estimates were calculated using the database and software developed by Smucker et al.32 Of the 22,080 adults who were given the questionnaire , ap­ proximately 6% were excluded from analysis because of coding, interviewer, or respondent error. In addi­ tion, individuals reporting a racial or ethnic identifi­ cation other than white, black, or Hispanic were ex­ cluded. The sample analyzed in this study comprised 20,143 individuals. Further details regarding the meth­ odology of the supplements and the collection of dietary data can be found elsewhere.33
  The 1987 National Health Interview Survey data collection is divided into calendar quarters. By design, the number of respondents within each quarter was nearly equivalent and representative of U.S. house­ holds. Calendar quarters approximately correspond to the four seasons, winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively . Therefore, quarters were used to repre­ sent seasons in all analyses.
We  evaluated  two possible types of reporting errors
that might be influenced by current seasonal intake . The first involves the ability to characterize oneself as being a consumer or nonconsumer of each food. The second involves the ability to characterize usual fre­ quency of intake of each food over the  past year  given

that one consumes a food item at all. For both of these factors, we investigated response bias that might be due to whether or not the food was "in season" at the time the questionnaire was administered. Separate lo­ gistic regression analyses were used to address these issues. All regression analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted by age, race/ethnicity (white, black, His­ panic), region of the country (North, South, Midwest, and West), education (<12 years , 12 years , >12 years), and poverty index (above or below poverty). We used one logistic regression model to estimate the propor­ tion (predicted probability) of respondents reporting being a consumer vs a nonconsumer for each season of questionnaire administration for each food item. After we excluded nonconsumers for an individual food, we used a second model to estimate the propor­ tion of individuals reporting intake above or below the sex-specific yearly median intake for each food in each season. Logistic regressions th at included nonconsu­ mers did not appreciably change the results. Logistic regression results and weighted median values for foods and nutrients were obtained using SAS.34
  Epidemiologists commonly stratify individuals into quantiles as a way of summarizing dietary information. To evaluate how seasonal reporting bias might lead to misclassification, we classified respondents according to sex-specific quintiles of nutrient and food group intake for the total sample and compared these assign­ ments with ones made within each season separately.

Results
Gender -specific seasonal differences in the estimated proportions of individual s reporting being a consumer or reporting intake above the median were generally less than 5%. We present results for only those foods that showed seasonal differences for either gender  of  at least 5 %.
  Table 1 shows the estimated proportion of individ­ uals reporting being a consumer of individual food items by gender and season of questionnaire adminis­ tration. The eight foods presented in Table 1 show, by either gender, differences of at least 5% in those reporting being a consumer vs a nonconsumer between any two seasons. The most striking and consistent seasonal bias is for oranges, with about  8- 10% more of both men and women reporting being consumers when the questionnaire is administered in winter com­ pared with summer and fall. Results are similar for grape fruit. Being a consumer of chocolate candy is more likely to occur when the questionnaire is admin­ istered in the winter as compared with summer  for both genders .

  Table 2 shows the predicted probability of the pro ­ portion of the population, by season, reporting intake above the sex-specific median for each food. Twenty­ two are presented for which there is a difference in either gender between any two seasons of at least 5.0%. Differences in the proportion of individuals reporting intake above the median are greatest for oranges (6- 12%), with higher intakes reported in the winter and spring compared with the summer and fall for  both men and women. Similarly, both genders  tend  to report the highest yearly intake for tomatoes when the questionnaire is administered in the summer compared

with all other seasons, with differences as high as 8%. Lowest intakes for cooked cereal are reported in the spring and summer. Individuals responding to the questionnaire in the summer tend to report higher usual intake of ice cream and lower intake of chocolate candy compared with other seasons. Results for re­ ported intake of other foods are inconsistent across genders.
  Table 3 shows eight food items from Tables 1 and 2 for which differences in median reported intake (non­ consumers excluded) by season of questionnaire ad­ ministration were found equal to or greater than one-

half serving per week in either men or women . For men , one-half and one-third less of a serving per week of oranges is reported in summer and fall, respectively, compared with winter and spring. Reported tomato intake is nearly 50% higher in the summer compared to other seasons.
  We selected several nutrients and food groups (en­ ergy, macronutrients, cholesterol, carotene, dietary fi­ ber, vitamin A, vitamin C, citrus fruits, desserts, fruits, fruits and vegetables, garden vegetables , processed meats, salads) and examined them using logistic regres­ sion to estimate the proportion of individuals expected to report intake above or below sex-specific median intake. Ten per cent more women reported intake above the median of citrus fruits in winter compared with summer. Similarly, the proportion of both men and women reporting intake above the median for fruits was highest in the winter compared with all other seasons. Estimated intake of vitamin C was more likely to be above the median in winter and spring compared with summer and fall. Reported intake of salads and garden vegetables was more likely to be above the median in the spring and summer for both genders and for women , respectively.
  We show median reported intakes of the selected nutrients and food groups by gender and season in Table 4. No nutritionally meaningful differences were found in the estimated median nutrient intakes by season of questionnaire administration . For food groups, median reported intakes of citrus fruits, fruits and vegetables, and salads among women showed a difference between two seasons that was greater  than or equal to one serving per week.
  Sex-specific quintile assignments were determined for the nutrients and food groups in Table 4 for  the total year data and then within each season. No indi­ vidual's pair of quintile assignments differed by more than one adjacent stratum. We present in Figure 1 the


nutrients and food groups from Table 4 for which at least 9% of subjects in either gender have a season­ specific quintile assignment that differs from the total year quintile assignment. We selected 9% as an arbi­ trary cutpoint based on meaningful differences in the distribution of changes in quintile assignmen ts. The figure shows the percentage of men or women whose quintile assignment based on the total year differs by one quintile compared with the season-specific quintile assignment .
  The largest quintile shifts found in Figure 1 occurred among the food groups or nutrients associated with oranges: citrus fruits, fruits, and vitamin C. Assignment of citrus fruit quintiles decreased for 18.4% and 8.5% of women and men , respectively, from the total pop­ ulation compared with the summer , and decreased
7.8 % and 7.6%, for women and men, respectively, compared with the fall. Similar,  but  fewer ,  changes were found for vitamin C (summer and  fall)  and  all fruits (summer only). Assignment of quintiles of re­ ported salad intake  for  the  total  population  increased for 10.5- 12.7% of women compared with spring and summer.


Discussion
These data demonstrate that individuals are not en­ tirely successful at separating their most current sea­ sonal intake from their usual intake over the past year . This result is consistent with several studies18 26 indi­ cating that current diet influences reports of past diets. For example, results showing that the proportion of individuals who report yearly intake at greater than the median (Table 2) for oranges and tomatoes is variable by season of questionnaire administration are consistent with what might be expected given the seasonal availabili ty/ cost of these foods. Although re­ spondents are instructed to give their best estimate of

usual yearly intake, for a few foods it appears difficult for them to take the long view of the situation.
  Reported year-long consumption of foods such as stew and cooked cereal is higher  when  respondents are asked in the fall. For soda and ice cream, such consumption is higher when respondents are asked in the summer. Chocolate candy is reported with in­ creased frequency in the winter and fall, perhaps owing to the presence of holidays. Orange  juice, as opposed to fresh oranges, is available at stable prices year-round yet is reported with higher frequency  in  the  winter and fall by women; this reported intake pattern would perhaps appear to be consistent with the cold and flu season and belief that vitamin C may be beneficial. It  is unclear, however why foods like liver, liquor, wine, peanuts, milk, fried fish, fried chicken, salty snacks, or pies show any meaningful variation in reporting among seasons.
  There is consistency in the finding of differences of at least 5.0% between seasons in reporting intake at greater than the median and reporting being a con­ sumer (Tables 1 and 2) for chocolate candy, grapefruit, ice cream, liquor, and oranges. Such findings indicate that these foods have the greatest seasonal reporting biases attached to them. Other foods appeared on one list and not the other. This pattern supports the notion



that different mechanisms of recall bias might be in­ volved. Another explanation may be that some foods are infrequently consumed by most of the population (grapefruit, liquor, peanuts), whereas others are con­ sumed by nearly everyone but with various frequencies (orange juice, tomatoes, salads).
  While investigators might hope that individuals could better generalize intake over the past year for seasonal foods, the fact that some biases exist is impor­ tant only if it substantially affects estimates of nutrient or food group intake, and/or affects classification of respondents. With respect to the first issue, we show that estimated intakes of vitamin C, citrus fruits, fruits, salads, and garden vegetables were frequently reported at levels above the median in at least one season. Nevertheless, the  median estimated  intake of vitamin C was not meaningfully different by season. This finding indicates that, in estimating the median nu­ trient intake in a population, vitamin C occurs in enough foods to balance the impact of the seasonal reporting bias that we found for citrus fruit. Median estimated intakes of citrus fruits, salads, fruits, and fruits and vegetables varied by approximately one serv­ ing or more per week across seasons. These differences are notable but not striking.

investigated the short-term reproducibility of the 98- item version of the Block questionnaire 0 administered over three different seasons in the same year to 68 dietetics graduates. Consistent with our results, point estimates for nutrients by season were all within 10% of each other. Problems with classification were found based on season of questionnaire administration: on average , only 52% of subjects in the study showed exact agreement in quartile assignment of nutrients in any two of three seasons, with summer vs winter classifications showing the overall poorest agreement (48% ).
  Investigators create food groups because of similari­ ties in nutrient content, content of other dietary constituents, and/or food use patterns. The 59-item questionnaire used in the present research was fairly complete with respect to citrus fruits, and the ques­ tionnaire included apple s. Other frequently consumed

would have been placed in an adjacent quintile had total year cutpoints been used. The greatest misclassi­ fication occurred for citrus fruits; 18.4% of  women who responded to the questionnaire  in  the  summer and were categorized into summer quintiles  would have been placed in the adjacent  lower quintile  had the cutpoints for the entire year's data been  applied, and 13% of women completing the  questionnaire  in the winter would have moved to an adjacent higher quintile using the total year data cutpoints. Although seasonal biases are evident in these results, the findings that shifts were never greater than an adjacent quintile and that they did not occur for many foods indicates that the biases are small.
In  this questionnaire, individuals  were  asked  to do
their best in estimating frequency of intake for all foods. The results indicate that individuals may have found this task to be somewhat difficult for some foods.

fruits (peaches, plums, berries, etc), were not on the food list. Thus, results for total fruit intake are domi­ nated by citrus fruits and apples . Had other seasonal fruits been on the questionnaire, it is likely that sea­ sonal reporting biases would have been found for individual fruits. It is unclear , however, how seasonal reporting bias for total fruit intake would  be affected by having a more complete list of individual fruits. The vegetable list on the questionnaire is more complete with respect to carotenoid-containing vegetables . Some very popular vegetables (green beans, peas, and com) are not on the food list, however, leaving questions as to whether seasonal reporting biases would have been found for the total vegetable food group intake had they been present.
  Food frequency questionnaires are designed by in­ vestigators for different purposes. In many cases, the foods are grouped, and/or nutrient  indices  are  devised for purposes of summarizing  individual  diets.  These food group and nutrient indices vary across studies not only because the questionnaires themselves  are  differ­ ent , but also because investigators make different de­ cisions regarding how to group foods. For  epidemio­ logic analyses, nutrients or  food  groups  are often  used to stratify respondents  on  the  basis  of  consumption. Our data show that, if we accept the premise  that quintiles computed from data for the entire year most closely reflect "truth," then when individuals change quintiles based  on  the  cutpoints  computed  by  season in a systematic fashion, there is evidence of bias that might lead to misclassification . For vitamin C , citrus fruit, and salad intake, approximately  10- 18%  of  men or women given the questionn aire in a single season

intake associated with seasons. Such questionnaires may be helpful not only in decreasing seasonal report­ ing biases, but also in easing the task of completing a frequency questionnaire by not asking the  respondent to do difficult computations that may not be done well or at all. If the primary  purpose  of a questionnaire  is to estimate average intake of a population, it is probably best to administer the questionnaire throughout 12 months of the year, as was done in the National Health Interview Survey. If the purpose of a questionnaire  is to properly categorize individuals into quantiles of intake, one might administer the questionnaire in a single season for the entire sample or probe for sea­ sonal intake differences.
