Background: Increasing prevalence of obesity and lifestyle related chronic disease is fundamentally tied
to Americans' poor eating habits. Family environment, including the presence of children, may affect
adults' diet behavior.
Objective: To compare dietary fat intake between adults with and without minor children in the home.
Design: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey III (NHANES III) public use dataset.
Subjects: Adults aged 17 to 65 years with and without children younger than 17 years old in the home.
Outcome variables: Intake of total fat, saturated fat, and kilocalories based on a 24-hour dietary
recall and a selection of high-fat foods from a food frequency questionnaire.
Methods: Linear and logistic regression, accounting for the sample weights and complex survey design.
Results: The presence of children in the household was associated with significantly higher adjusted
total fat consumption for adults (4.9 g/24 hours [95% CI: 0.8, 9.1]) and significantly higher adjusted
saturated fat consumption (1.7 g/24 hours [0.3, 3.3]). Adults with children ate many high-fat foods
more frequently than adults without children, including salty snacks, pizza, cheese, beef, ice cream,
cakes/cookies, bacon/sausage/processed meats, and peanuts.
Conclusions: The presence of children in the home may affect adults' diets. Providers should empha-
size dietary discretion for the entire family. (J Am Board Fam Med 2007;20:9­15.)
The epidemic of obesity and lifestyle-related
chronic diseases is fundamentally tied to Ameri-
cans' poor eating habits. As measured in the Na-
tional Health and Nutition Examination Survey
(NHANES), the percentage of calories from fat
decreased from 36% to 33% and saturated fat from
13% to 11% from 1971 to 2000. However, mean
average total food intake increased over the same
period, so that total fat and total saturated fat re-
mained stable or increased.1
Overall, Americans remain above guidelines for
consumption of saturated fat and total fat. The US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2005 recommends that
adults maintain their total fat intake between 20%
and 35% of caloric intake and saturated fat con-
sumption below 10% of caloric intake (20 g sat-
urated fat for a 2000-kcal diet).2 Cross-sectional
data from NHANES III shows little variation in
percentage of total and saturated fat by age except
for somewhat lower percentage consumed among
those 60 years of age. However, total caloric intake
generally increases with age in childhood, peaking at
16 to 19 in boys and 12 to 15 in girls, then decreasing
somewhat in later adulthood. Therefore, total fat
consumption is highest among teenagers,3,4 and in-
take of fast food (generally high in fat) is highest
among children, teenagers and young adults5
Multiple factors influence individuals' food
choices, including their home environments.

Within families, there are correlations between the
fat intake of spouses6,7 and between adults' and
children's diets.8,9 This finding has been inter-
preted as parental influence on children's diets, but
may also signify a reciprocal influence of children
on adults. The impact of children on adults dietary
behavior is poorly understood. Previous investiga-
tors have postulated that having children in the
household might increase fat intake,10 but this hy-
pothesis has not been tested in a national sample.
In this study, we examine diet patterns of 2
groups of adults, those with minor children in the
household versus those without, using a nationally
representative sample from NHANES III.
Methods
Study Sample
The NHANES III survey was conducted from
1988 to 1994. A sample representative of the US
noninstitutionalized population aged 2 months and
older was drawn from 89 sites using a complex,
stratified, multistage probability cluster design.11
Mexican Americans, African Americans, and adults
60 years of age were oversampled. Race/ethnicity
was self-reported and categorized into non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Ameri-
can, and other.12 Interviews took place in the re-
spondents' homes and then respondents were
invited to the Mobile Examination Centers (MEC)
for further examination and data collection (includ-
ing the 24-hour dietary recall). The overall
weighted response rates were 82% for the interview
and 73% for the MEC examination.11,12
From the NHANES public-use data set, we
identified adults aged 17 to 65 years living in
households with and without children. Families
with children were identified through eligibility for
questions that were only asked of families with
children younger than 17 years of age relating to
food insecurity. Families were coded by NHANES
as yes, no, eligible but missing, and missing (de-
fined as not eligible ie, not having children under
17). This allowed us to identify families with chil-
dren less than 17 years old but did not allow for
further information to be collected about the chil-
dren (ie, age, sex, and number of children were not
available). Analysis was limited to the second phase
of NHANES III, for the years 1991 to 1994, as the
questions used to identify adults with children were
not part of the questionnaire in phase 1 (1988 to
1990).
After examining the distribution of kilocalories
in our sample, we excluded outliers in the top and
bottom 1% for total kilocalories per 24 hours based
on the 24-hour dietary recall (524 kcal, 5889
kcal; 135 observations) to create our final analytic
sample. We excluded these extreme outliers based
on the assumption that these kilocalorie values
were unlikely to represent the participants' usual
daily intake.
Outcome Measures
The principal outcome variables were total fat in-
take and total saturated fat intake (in grams), based
on a 24-hour dietary recall. The secondary out-
come was total kilocalorie consumption, also based
on 24-hour dietary recall.
Given our findings regarding total fat intake, we
also examined intake frequencies of individual
foods reported by NHANES respondents. Analysis
of individual food frequencies was based on the
food frequency questionnaire13 administered at
home to all adults in the survey. Dependent vari-
ables included the number of times a particular
food was consumed per month. In consultation
with a nutritionist, high fat foods were chosen from
among 60 available food frequencies to correspond
to those identified by the USDA guidelines2 as
major sources of saturated fat in the American diet
and other types of contrasting fats identified by the
investigators. Specific high fat food groups ana-
lyzed were: ice cream, ice milk and milk shakes;
salty snacks; cheese; pizza, calzones and lasagna;
cheese dishes; bacon, sausage and luncheon meats;
beef; chicken and turkey; eggs; cakes, cookies,
brownies, pies, donuts and pastries; chocolate
candy and fudge; margarine; butter; and mayon-
naise, oil and vinegar, and salad dressings.
Independent Variables
The independent variable of chief interest was the
presence or absence of one or more children in the
home. Other independent variables included re-
spondents education, race/ethnicity, age, presence
of a spouse or spouse equivalent in the home, pov-
erty-income ratio, gender, foreign-born status, and
body mass index (BMI). Simple imputation was
used to impute missing values of poverty-income
ratio based on a regression using race, age, sex,
foreign born status, education, family size, and an-
other separate income variable (491 observations
imputed, 7.4% of sample). This method is appro-
10 JABFM January­February 2007 Vol. 20 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.org
priate because the imputed values comprised less
than 10% of the sample. Regressions were also
analyzed with and without imputed values and with
and without income variables, and there were no
significant differences in conclusions, so analyses
with imputation are presented.
Analyses of 24-hour Dietary Consumption Patterns
STATA 8.0 was used for all analyses (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX). Commands used Taylor lin-
earization for the variance estimation to account
for the complex survey design using NHANES-
assigned weights, population sampling units, and
strata. All results presented are based on analyses
with sample weights.
We used linear regression for all analyses of the
principal and secondary outcomes, using log trans-
formation to normalize the distributions. Indepen-
dent variables described above that were found to
be associated with total fat intake in bivariate
analyses were included in all models; adult BMI
and presence of spouse were not associated with
fat intake. The Duan smearing technique for
weighted, log-transformed data was used to obtain
adjusted mean estimates.14 Bootstrapping was used
to estimate confidence intervals.
Analyses of Individual Food Frequencies
Logistic regression was used for food frequency
analysis. Depending on the distribution of food
frequencies for each food item, we dichotomized
results as eating the food either more than once a
week or daily and above versus those eating the
food less frequently. For consistency we used the
same independent variables as for the analyses of fat
intake.
Sensitivity Analyses
Regressions for primary outcomes analyses were
repeated for a subpopulation age 22 to 65 (exclud-
ing the 17 to 21 year olds). In several additional
sensitivity analyses, we added 24-hour total kilo-
calorie consumption as a control variable. We
could not control for number of children in the
home. Because African Americans, Mexican Amer-
icans, and some adults of foreign birth typically
have higher birth rates than non-Hispanic whites,15
we also modeled interaction terms for race/ethnic-
ity and child, and for foreign-born status and child.
In addition, gender and child interactions were
explored. None of these interaction terms were
statistically significant, so all were excluded from
the final model. Age was examined both as a con-
tinous variable (presented) and explored in second-
ary analyses as a categorical variable.
This study was approved as exempt by the Uni-
versity of Michigan Medical School Institutional
Review Board.
Results
Sample Characteristics
The analytic sample included 6660 respondents;
48% of adult respondents reported one or more
children in the household. African American and
Mexican American households were dispropor-
tionately more likely to have children (P  .001)
(Table 1).
Patterns of Total Fat, Saturated Fat, and Calorie
Consumption
Overall, presence of children in the household was
associated with significantly higher adjusted total
fat consumption for adults: 4.9 g/24 hours (95%
confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.8, 9.1) (Table 2).
The presence of children in the household was also
associated with significantly higher adjusted satu-
rated fat consumption: 1.7 g/24 hours (0.3, 3.3)
(Table 2). Interaction terms were not significant,
suggesting no differential effect of children by race,
foreign-born status, or gender of the adult. We also
evaluated whether the effect of having children on
fat consumption was modified by adult age group
but found no statistically significant difference.
With inclusion of total kilocalories in the model,
the associations of children with adult total fat
intake and saturated fat intake showed the same
trend but were no longer statistically significant
(P  .07 and P  .12, respectively).
Adults aged 17 to 21 years are those most likely
to represent a sibling rather than a parent or guard-
ian. In sensitivity analyses for fat consumption ex-
cluding adults aged 17 to 21 years, the differences
in fat consumption were even greater: 5.5 g of total
fat (P  .05) and 2.0 g of saturated fat (P  .01).
Analysis of total caloric consumption showed no
significant association with presence of children in
the household (Table 2).
Patterns of Consumptions for Individual Foods
Food frequency data revealed that adults with chil-
dren in the home have higher odds of drinking any

milk versus no milk (odds ratio 1.28 (1.03, 1.59))
but do not have higher odds of frequently drinking
milk (daily or greater) vs. some or none. They were
not significantly more likely to drink whole milk.
Adults with children had significantly higher odds
of frequently eating pizza, cheese, beef, salty
snacks, cakes and cookies, ice cream, bacon/sau-
sage/processed meats and peanuts (Table 3).
Discussion
This study indicates, in a nationally representative
sample, that the presence of children in the home is
associated with higher total fat and saturated fat
intake among adults. To put these differences in
perspective, the approximately 2-g difference in
saturated fat intake is the equivalent of one addi-
tional standard slice of pepperoni pizza every day,
or almost one additional pizza per week.16 This
finding is consistent with a preliminary analysis by
Emmons et al of a predominantly white sample
(5253) of manufacturing employees10 (also Em-
mons, personal communication, 2005). The results
differ somewhat from a small study in one Austra-
lian community (405 subjects), which found higher
caloric consumption among women with children
versus women without, but no significant differ-
ence in fat consumption.17
The association of children with total fat con-
sumption in the NHANES sample was attenuated
by controlling for total caloric consumption. This

suggests that part of the association of children
with fat consumption is mediated though overall
greater caloric consumption, in addition to food
choices with higher fat content. Consistent with
this view, analysis of total caloric consumption for
24 hours found slightly higher (but not significantly
higher) caloric intake for adults with children in the
home.
Data from a limited food frequency question-
naire enabled us to examine some high-fat food
choices. Adults with children ate many high-fat
foods more frequently than adults without children
in the home, including salty snacks, pizza, cheese,
beef, ice cream, cakes and cookies, bacon/sausage/
processed meats and peanuts. In particular, adults
with children in the home had more frequent
cheese intake along with increased fat intake. This
pattern is consistent with previous research show-
ing increased fat consumption among people eating
the most cheese compared with no difference asso-
ciated with overall dairy consumption.18 Other
analyses have indicated that dairy foods contribute
19% of fat and 32% of saturated fat to the Amer-
ican diet.18
Potential explanations for the above findings are
related to time pressures and constraints among
adults with children, children's preferences for high
fat, high sugar foods19 and parents' perceptions of
what children are likely to eat. In response to time
constraints, adults may purchase more restaurant,
ready-to-eat, or snack foods, all which are likely to
be higher in fat content. Parents may intentionally
choose some higher-fat foods for their children
such as non-skim milk products. Parents may also
purchase foods they expect their children will eat,
such as cheese. Although not specifically purchased
for the adult, we hypothesize that adults will be
more likely to consume these foods if present in the
household, compared with adults without children
who may not purchase these items as frequently.
Salty snacks, pizza, beef (in the form of ham-
burgers), ice cream, and cakes and cookies all rep-
resent convenience foods purchased for near-term
consumption. Therefore, their higher intake
among adults with children is consistent with the
above time hypothesis. Why chocolate, a similar
snack food, did not also show a difference is un-
clear. In addition, consumer studies have shown
that "parents are 2 to 3 times more likely to name
their child, not themselves, as the family expert for
selection of fast food, snack foods, restaurants and
new breakfast cereals"20,21 and that almost "50% of
parents believe that meal and grocery choices and
restaurant selection are influenced by their chil-

dren."21 Parents with children are likely to be sus-
ceptible in their food choices to both the marketing
of convenience in food choices as well as indirectly
to the marketing directed at their children.
An alternative explanation for our finding is that
adults with and without children differ in some way
which was not measured but which also affects their
diet choices. Even if this is the case, providers still
may need to approach dietary counseling differ-
ently for adults with and without children in the
household.
Limitations
This study's chief limitation is the inability to ac-
count for child variables such as the child's rela-
tionship to the adult and child age. The presence of
children in the home may have a stronger effect on
parents who are directly responsible for feeding
their children. Thus, this limitation would be ex-
pected to attenuate the strength of the association
as this analysis includes nonparental adults living in
households with children. If we could isolate par-
ents, we might find a stronger association.
The effect may also be different depending on
the age of the child. In particular, older children
may be more independent in their eating patterns
and thus have less influence on adults' intake. In
addition, it is possible that new parents may try to
improve the health of their diets, as has been ob-
served in one study regarding fruits and vegetable
consumption, but such improvements may prove
difficult to sustain.22 This analysis is also limited by
the availability of only one 24-hour dietary recall
per individual and by the dataset's cross-sectional
nature. Food frequency analysis was limited to
questions available in the NHANES dataset and
some groupings included options with variable fat
content. Thus these findings must be interpreted
with some caution.
An additional limitation, in terms of implica-
tions, is that the role of dietary fat in cardiovascular
disease prevention for older women has recently
come into question.23 Nevertheless, the influence
of dietary fat and saturated fat on younger adults'
weight status and cardiovascular health remains a
major concern of physicians and public health of-
ficials alike.
Conclusion
In response to these findings, health care providers
should consider the potential influence of children
in the home on adults dietary behaviors. Counsel-
ing on dietary change should be aimed at both
adults and children in the home. Providers should
emphasize that children should also be eating
healthy foods and that bringing less healthy foods
into the home for the children may also have a
negative impact on the adult's diet. Visits may in-
clude discussion of how to improve a family's diet,
such as identifying healthier options available ei-
ther as prepared foods or from restaurants and
perhaps providing suggestions for quick, healthy
recipes. Discussions should also include strategies
for influencing and incorporating children's food
preferences into a healthy diet.
In addition, parents should be encouraged to
expose their children to healthier foods and re-
minded that the American Association of Pediatrics
and American Heart Association recommend that
children change to lower fat milk after the age of
2.24 Cheese products, beef, snack food, and pizza­
sources of additional fat intake for adults with chil-
dren in the home in this national study­can be
targeted for better dietary control.
In addition, these findings suggest that food ad-
vertising aimed at children may influence not only
the child's diet but also indirectly affect parents'
diets. Health care providers have the potential to
improve adults' dietary behaviors and influence
overall family health by acknowledging and ad-
dressing the reciprocal influences of adults' and
children's dietary behaviors.

firming and identifying high-fat food choices within the food
