Introduction
Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular
diseases, and the search for treatable causes and effec-
tive diagnostic methods is a challenge for doctors.
Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the causes of
hypertension.1 Currently, it is assumed that it may affect
5%-12% of patients with hypertension, so there is a need
to improve diagnostic methods, especially for effective
screening.2,3
Measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA) or direct
renin concentration (DRC) and aldosterone concentration
are used for investigation in cases of suspected PA. There
are many factors that can have an influence on these bio-
chemical results, such as: drugs, body position, time of day,
diet, method of blood collection (avoiding stasis and
hemolysis), temperature and time of blood processing and
laboratory method.4­6 Performing these measurements, we
should be well informed about all precautions and require-
ments concerning proper blood sample processing.
Aims of the study
1. To investigate whether cooling samples after their
collection and during centrifugation influences the
results of PRA and DRC measurements.

on plasma renin activity (PRA) and
concentrations of direct renin (DRC) and

Abstract
Introduction: Performing measurements of plasma renin activity (PRA) or direct renin concentration (DRC) and
aldosterone concentration, we should be well informed about requirements concerning blood sample processing.
Material and methods: Forty-seven patients had blood collected in the supine and upright positions. Blood was
withdrawn into two EDTA2
K tubes and one with clot activator. One EDTA2
K tube was cooled at +4°C and centrifuged
at +4°C whereas the other was prepared at room temperature. PRA and DRC were measured by radioimmunoassay
(RIA) and radioimmunometry (IRMA), respectively, in both cooled and not cooled plasma samples, and aldosterone was
measured by RIA in not cooled plasma and in serum.
Results: In all the groups, with low, medium, and high values of PRA and direct renin, the temperature of sample
processing within 30 minutes had no marked influence on the final result (correlation coefficient for renin was 0.9994,
and for PRA, 0.8297). The measured concentrations of aldosterone also showed high correlation (r = 0.9790) but were
markedly higher in plasma.
Conclusion: The measurements of DRC, and to a lesser extent PRA, were similar regardless of temperature condition
during the 20­30 minutes necessary for blood sample processing. Aldosterone concentrations in plasma vs serum samples
appeared to be markedly higher.

2. To investigate whether the results of aldosterone
concentration measured in serum and EDTA2
K
plasma are similar and can be referenced to the
same reference values.
Material and methods
Forty-seven patients with an indication for testing the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system had blood collection after a
night's rest in the supine position (0hr) and again after
walking for two hours (2hr). At each collection, blood was
withdrawn into two EDTA2
K tubes (plasma) and one with a
clot activator (serum). After blood collection, one tube was
transported to the laboratory in a cool state (within 10 min-
utes) and the other tube at ambient (room) temperature
(also within 10 minutes). The cooled at +4°C blood sample
was centrifuged at +4°C (10 minutes, 3500 rpm) whereas
the not cooled sample was centrifuged at ambient (room)
temperature (10 minutes, 3500 rpm). The biological mate-
rial (serum, EDTA2
K-plasma) was frozen at ­30°C and
stored until assayed.
Aldosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA)
(ZenTech, RIAZENco, Belgium). Analytical sensitivity
was 1.4 ng/l, functional sensitivity was 25 ng/l. The refer-
ence value at rest was 10­160 ng/l, and in the upright posi-
tion was 35­300 ng/l. Intra-assay coefficients of variation
(CV) were: 13.7% for 42 ng/l, 3.8% for 177 ng/l and 5.3%
for 278 ng/l, and inter-assay CV values were: 18.6% for 38
ng/l, 7.5% for 169 ng/l and 6.2% for 284 ng/l.
PRA was measured by radioimmunoassay kit (RIA),
(CISbio International, France). The standard 90-minute
incubation time at 37°C was applied for generation of angi-
otensin I. Analytical sensitivity was 0.1 ng/ml per hour. The
reference value at rest in the supine position was 0.2­2.8
ng/ml per hour, and in the upright position was 1.5­5.7 ng/
ml per hour. Intra-assay CV values were: 4.3% for 1.4 ng/
ml per hour, 6.5% for 3.8 ng/ml per hour and 7.2% for 16.0
ng/ml per hour. Inter-assay CV values were: 9.9% for 1.4
ng/ml per hour, 4.9% for 3.9 ng/ml per hour and 8.5% for
15.8 ng/ml per hour.
Renin was measured by radioimmunometric kit (IRMA)
manufactured by CISbio International (France). According
to the kit producer, analytical sensitivity was 1 ng/l. The
reference value at rest in the recumbent position in patients
between 20 and 40 years of age was 3.6­20.1 ng/l, and
between 41 and 60 years, 1.1­20.2 ng/l. In the upright posi-
tion in patients between 20 and 40 years, the reference
value was 5.1­38.7 ng/l, and between 41 and 60 years, 1.8­
59.4 ng/l. The intra-assay CV values were: 3.6% for 3.8
ng/l, 1.5% for 65.4 ng/l and 0.9% for 262 ng/l. The inter-
assay CV values were: 5.0% for 4 ng/l, 3.6% for 72 ng/l,
and 4.0% for 263 ng/l.
The study was approved by the bioethics committee at
The Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education.
All results are expressed as median and mean ± SD.
Differences between the groups are presented as percent-
ages. The relationships between the compared results were
expressed using correlation analysis.
Results
Among 47 investigated patients, PA was diagnosed in four
patients (adrenal hyperplasia in three and aldosteronoma in
one).
In the group of results with PRA < 1 ng/ml per hour, the
median values at ambient (room) temperature vs +4°C were
as follow: PRA 0.3 vs 0.3 and renin 3.3 vs 3.3. In the group
of results with PRA between 1 and 10 ng/ml per hour, the
median values were: PRA 2.6 vs 2.5 and renin 13.6 vs 14.3,
and in the group of results above 10 ng/ml per hour, the
median was 16 vs 14 for PRAand 86 vs 75 for renin (Table 1).
Correlation between measurements at ambient (room) tem-
perature and +4°C was r = 0.8297 for PRA and r = 0.9994
for renin (Figures 1 and 2).
Individual results of PRA and renin (DRC) at ambient
(room) temperature vs +4°C are presented in Table 2.

The measured concentrations of aldosterone in plasma
(EDTA2
K) and serum samples showed high correlation (r =
0.9790) (Figure 3), but appeared markedly higher in plasma
than in serum. The median serum aldosterone concentra-
tion was 258 ng/l (range 68­2100 ng/l), and the median
concentration in plasma (EDTA2
K) was 444 ng/l (range
150­2226 ng/l). The differences between pairs of plasma
and serum samples ranged from 37% to 144% (median
75%) (Table 3).
Discussion
In the past, blood samples for PRA have been collected and
transported to laboratories on ice and centrifuged at 2­4°C
to avoid enzyme activation and uncontrolled initiation of
angiotensin I production.
Reports of possible renin cryoactivation at low tem-
perature led to initial confusion and the suggestion that
blood samples should be processed at room temperature.
This controversial question was therefore further
investigated.
Brossaud and Corcuff showed that PRA decreased
significantly when blood samples were stored for five
hours at room temperature as compared to +4°C stor-
age.7 They stated that within that period enzyme degra-
dation at room temperature was more important than
potential cryoactivation, and decided to maintain sample
processing at +4°C.
Similarly, Locsei et al. showed that PRA and direct renin
decreased significantly when blood samples were kept at
room temperature for two hours before processing, but they
changed only marginally if blood samples were placed at
0­5°C for the same period of time.8
From our study it appears that when processing blood
samples, cool or room temperature during the initial 20­30
minutes has no significant effect on the results of direct
renin, and to a lesser extent, on PRA. Therefore, a refriger-
ated centrifuge is not necessary at the site of blood draw-
ing, if the blood samples can be further processed either in
ambient or cool conditions within 20­30 minutes in the
local laboratory. Otherwise, according to suggestions by
Locsei et al., they could be placed at 0­5°C and trans-
ported to a laboratory in less than two hours8 or possibly
quickly centrifuged and transported frozen on dry ice.
A limitation of this part of our study is that we have
tested only blood samples processed within 20­30 min-
utes and that in the PRA assay we applied only the stand-
ard 90-minute incubation time for generation of
angiotensin I.
A comprehensive and detailed review concerning meth-
odology of PRA and DRC and precautions necessary to
ensure accuracy of these assays was presented by Campbell
et al.9
Determining aldosterone seemed simpler and less prob-
lematic. Nevertheless, there are reports of differences in
aldosterone results with the use of different aldosterone
assays.5
Currently used assays allow determination of aldoster-
one both in serum and in plasma, but do not differentiate
the range of reference values for them. Therefore we were
surprised by the results of our study comparing the aldos-
terone concentrations in serum and in EDTA-plasma sam-
ples obtained from the same subjects at the same time. We
observed that using the RIA-CT assay the measured aldos-
terone concentrations in plasma samples were markedly
higher than in serum samples, and these differences ranged
from 37% to 144%.
Confirmation of our observation can be found in the
study by Taylor et al., who measured aldosterone in plasma
and serum using high-performance chromatography and
tandem mass spectrometry. In their study aldosterone val-
ues were similar for EDTA and heparin plasma samples,
but were much lower in the plain clot samples (51.3%) and
the serum separator samples (42.2%).10
Hartman et al., comparing aldosterone results in EDTA-
plasma and heparin-plasma samples, obtained concordant

results too; however, they did not investigate serum sam-
ples from the same patients.11
Our findings seem to have practical value for laboratory
practice because reference values for plasma and serum
samples should not be the same.
At this moment, however, we cannot explain the differ-
ent results in plasma and serum. We can add only that such
differences were also reported for some other substances
and were considered to be due to the so-called "matrix
effect."
Conclusions
1. Aldosterone concentrations in plasma (EDTA2
K) vs
serum samples appeared to be markedly higher and
therefore reference values should be calculated sep-
arately for plasma and serum samples.
2. The results of DRC and, to a lesser extent, of PRA,
were similar regardless of temperature condition
during the approximately 20- to 30-minute period
necessary for blood collection, centrifugation and
preservation at -30°C.
