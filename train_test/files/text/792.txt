Gaps In Employer Coverage: Lack Of Supply Or Lack Of Demand?
by Stephen H. Long and M. Susan Marquis
Abstract: According to data from the May 1988 Current Population Survey, 18 percent of workers
are in firms that do not offer health insurance- The question explored here is whether the absence of
insurance in these firms is related to lack of supply (that is, a failure of the firm to offer the benefit
because the price it faces is too high or the benefit too low) or lack of demand (that is, employees in
these firms would not purchase the insurance even if it were offered). Characteristics hypothesized to
affect the supply of insurance by firms (size, rate of turnover, and union status) are found to distinguish
whether or not firms offer insurance. The data show near-universal acceptance of group insurance
among employees offered the opportunity to participate. Both of these factors suggest a failure of
supply. However, employees in firms that do not offer insurance are young, low-wage earners who
work part time. These are also characteristics of workers who do not purchase group insurance even
when it is offered, suggesting that many of the workers who are not offered group insurance would
not participate in a plan even if the supply failure were corrected. These findings have implications
for the effectiveness of voluntary strategies to improve access, but they also raise concern over the
fairness to workers of mandates requiring that they purchase coverage.
There is widespread agreement that the problem of uninsured Ameri-
cans is a crisis that demands attention; however, there is no consen-
sus about the solution. Most proposals involve the expansion of
employment-based health insurance because about three-fourths of the
uninsured are workers or their dependents. The proposals differ in the
specific strategies they employ to expand insurance, however. The choice
among strategies depends both on their effectiveness in extending insurance
to all the uninsured and on their fairness to all parties, but particularly to
the uninsured people they are trying to help.
One unresolved issue that affects the choice among strategies is whether
the existing gaps in employment-based insurance are viewed as arising from
a lack of supply--that is, a failure of employers to offer insurance--or a lack
of demand to enroll on the part of employees. The choice among strategies
also depends on whether economic incentives are viewed as sufficient to
induce voluntary action by most firms and workers, or whether it is neces-
sary to mandate their insurance decisions to achieve universal coverage.
Exhibit 1 uses these distinctions to classify the key strategies involved in

several current national health reform proposals. First, consider the propos-
als that assume that the problem arises from a lack of supply that could be
corrected by voluntary responses to economic incentives. Examples are the
small-group market reform proposals and the strategy of offering tax credits
to small businesses to subsidize their insurance outlays.1 These proposals
strive to lower the price and increase the availability of insurance. They are
based on the recognition that small employers usually must pay higher
premiums than large businesses pay, that they may not be able to afford to
offer health benefits, and that sometimes small groups that include some-
one who is very ill cannot find any coverage.
A second strategy, still based on the belief that economic incentives will
induce the desired behavior, assumes the view that the failure is due to
employees' lack of demand for insurance. That is, whether or not they are
actually offered employment-based coverage, if they were offered it at
current prices they would choose not to enroll. This strategy provides
individual income tax credits or deductions to lower the effective price of
purchasing health insurance. An example of this approach is the recent
expansion of the earned income credit to include health insurance premi-
ums paid to cover dependent children.2
It is also possible to embrace more than one strategy in a single proposal.
For example, the Bush administration's plan relied heavily on voluntary
response to individual income tax incentives but also hoped to encourage
lower-cost insurance products through the development of "health insur-
ance networks."3
In contrast to the voluntary strategies, many proposals entail greatly
expanded regulation to assure that the formerly uninsured get covered. One
mandatory approach requires all employers to offer health insurance to
employees and their dependents. If such mandates left room for a voluntary
employee decision to enroll, then they would be based solely on the view
that being uninsured reflects a failure of supply. But most mandate propos-

284 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Supplement 1993
als also require employees to enroll in a plan, suggesting that being unin-
sured may also reflect a lack of demand. Moreover, most mandate proposals
include some form of small-group market reform or a residual public plan,
further suggesting that advocates of mandates subscribe to both hypotheses.
Current examples include the well-known "play-or-pay" proposals, which,
in contrast to a strict mandate, limit the burden on employment groups
with low wages.4 Another mandatory strategy requires that individuals be
insured, accompanied by tax subsidies for reasons of fairness.5 This is based
on the view that the uninsured do not demand insurance.
A possible advantage of the voluntary approaches is that on grounds of
fairness it can be assumed that those who participate in purchasing insur-
ance have done so willingly and therefore must have been made better off
by their purchase. On the other hand, the mandatory strategies are more
likely to meet the access goal, since there is substantial concern about
whether economic incentives alone will suffice. Moreover, by assuring that
the risk is spread across both healthy and unhealthy individuals, mandates
may result in a product that is more affordable for high-risk individuals. But
if the currently uninsured do not demand insurance, then mandates may
impose burdens on unwilling workers.
The purpose of this DataWatch is to investigate whether the reason some
employees go without health insurance is due to a lack of supply or a lack of
demand, using data from the May 1988 Current Population Survey (CPS)
Employee Benefits Supplement. These data allow us to distinguish between
uninsured employees who are not offered group insurance and those who
turn down an employer-sponsored plan.
Offers Of Employment-Based Health Insurance
Over three-quarters of all workers ages eighteen to sixty-four are offered
health insurance by their employer (Exhibit 2).6 Among those offered
insurance, 87 percent (66 percent of all workers) participate in the plan.
Eleven percent of those eligible for an employer group plan turn it down
because they have other coverage, generally through their spouse's em-
ployer. Only about 2 percent of employees eligible to participate turn down
an employer offer and remain uninsured.
About one-quarter of workers do not have access to employer-sponsored
health insurance through their own employer. About 6 percent of workers
are employed in firms that offer health insurance to employees but are not
eligible themselves. Full-time employment is a common requirement for
eligibility, and over half (54 percent) of ineligible employees work fewer
than thirty-five hours per week. Another 14 percent of those ineligible for
their employer's health benefit plan have been with the firm for fewer than

three months; this, we expect, reflects waiting period requirements.7
Eighteen percent of workers are in firms that do not offer insurance. This
is the group of workers that we wish to examine more closely to determine
whether they would elect group coverage if their employer offered it--that
is, is this gap a failure of supply or a failure of demand?
Firms That Do Not Offer Insurance Benefits
Hypotheses. We first examine characteristics of firms that are hypothec
sized to influence the decision to supply insurance, to see whether there is a
distinction between firms that do and do not offer insurance. Firm size is the
first of these characteristics. Small firms that wish to offer insurance face
higher premiums than large firms, and the high price may be a barrier
preventing some small employers from offering insurance. Small firms are
often less profitable than larger firms, and this too may be a factor in the
ability of some small firms to offer insurance.
There are several reasons that firms experiencing high turnover may be
less likely to offer insurance than other firms. The firm itself benefits from a
healthy employee population; providing health insurance is a way for a firm
to invest in the future health of its workers. If there is a lot of turnover
among the workers, the returns from this investment are smaller, which
may affect the decision to offer insurance.8 A second reason is that frequent
job turnover may raise the administrative cost of providing insurance and so
deter some firms from offering insurance. We also hypothesize that union-
ization affects the likelihood that the firm will offer insurance. Unions have
historically obtained health benefits for their members and are in a stronger

position than an individual employee to negotiate benefits.
Results. As hypothesized, firm size is an important factor in whether the
employer offers health benefits (Exhibit 3). Sixty percent of those in firms
of ten or fewer people have an employer that does not offer insurance as a
benefit, whereas fewer than 10 percent of workers in firms of 100 or more
persons are in firms not offering this benefit.9 The importance of firm size in
access to insurance is highlighted when we focus on the 18 percent of
workers employed by firms that do not offer health benefits (Exhibit 4).
Over half of these are in firms employing fewer than ten persons, and
almost 70 percent work for firms employing fewer than twenty-five people.
Seasonality is one component of job turnover, and workers in industries
with greater seasonal employment--such as agriculture, construction, and
retail trade--have less access to insurance (Exhibit 5). Over half of employ-
ees in the agriculture sector and one-third of employees in retail trade,
business services, and construction work for firms that do not offer insur-
ance as a benefit, whereas fewer than 10 percent of employees in transpor-
tation, manufacturing, and government are employed in such firms.10
A more direct measure of the effect of turnover on firms' offer of insur-
ance comes from comparing employment changes in the previous sixteen
months among workers in firms that do not offer insurance with workers in
firms that do make such offers.11 Almost half (45 percent) of workers in
firms not offering insurance had at least one employment turnover in the
previous sixteen months, and almost one-quarter (23 percent) had more
than one change. In contrast, only 23 percent of employees in firms offering
insurance experienced one or more employment changes in the previous
sixteen months, and only 10 percent had more than one change.
Unionization is also an important factor in access to insurance. In firms

contract; in firms that offer insurance, almost one-quarter of workers are
part of a union,12 Even when we control for firm size and industry, union
status is a statistically significant factor accounting for differences in the
offer of insurance.

288 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Supplement 1993
Employees In Firms Not Offering Insurance
Hypotheses. Because we found near-universal acceptance of group in-
surance among employees offered the opportunity to participate, one might
conclude that existing gaps in employer-sponsored insurance are not the
result of a lack of demand by workers but a problem of supply, especially for
workers in small firms. However, the picture becomes more complicated
when we examine characteristics hypothesized to affect workers' demand
for insurance and contrast those who accept their employer's offer, those
who turn down the offer, and those whose employers do not offer insurance.
The demand factors that we examine include ability to pay for insurance
and the price of insurance to the employee. We measure ability to pay by
the worker's wage and the hours of work. We do not have a direct measure
of the price of insurance; instead we study two proxy measures. The first
proxy is the employee's age. Younger workers use fewer health care services
than older workers. As a result, the expected benefits from a given policy
are less for younger workers, and so the effective price per unit of insurance
is higher. Thus, we hypothesize lower demand among younger workers.13
The second proxy measure of price is employee turnover. Turnover not
only increases the cost to employers, it also increases the cost to employees.
With a change in employment, the employee may have to meet a new
deductible or preexisting conditions may be excluded. Therefore, the effec-
tive price per unit of insurance is higher with frequent turnover, and
insurance becomes less attractive.
Results. The majority of workers in firms that do not offer insurance are
low-wage earners (Exhibit 6).14 Two-thirds of them earn an hourly wage of
less than $7 per hour, and 41 percent earn less than $5 per hour. The wage
profile of those who turn down their employer's offer--especially those who
do so for reasons other than their coverage under a spouse's employer
group--is quite similar: 61 percent earn less than $7 per hour, and 33
percent earn less than $5 per hour. In contrast, only 21 percent of workers
who enroll in their own employer plan are low-wage earners.
Many who work in firms not offering insurance and many who do not
enroll in their employer plan are part-time workers. Among the former, 36
percent work fewer than thirty-five hours per week; among the latter, 30
percent work fewer than thirty-five hours. Part-time employment is much
less common for workers enrolled in their group plan; only 10 percent of
them work fewer than thirty-five hours per week.
Because of low earnings from the combination of low wages and part-
time employment, those workers not enrolling in their employer plan may
lack the resources to purchase group coverage. The similar earnings and
hours profile of employees in firms that do not offer insurance suggests that

these workers too might not be able to pay for insurance even if offered it.
As a result, they may not demand that their employer offer coverage-
Other economic characteristics that are the proxy measures for the price
of insurance also distinguish employees in firms not offering insurance and
those who turn down the employer plan from workers who take the em-
ployer plan. Over one-quarter (26 percent) of workers in firms not offering
insurance are under age twenty-five, as are about one-third (32 percent) of
workers turning down insurance for reasons other than having insurance
through a spouse's employer. In contrast, only 10 percent of workers enroll-
ing in their own group plan are under age twenty-five.
Almost one-quarter of employees in firms that do not offer insurance and
one-quarter of employees who turn down their employer plan for reasons
other than coverage under another group plan experienced at least two
employment turnovers in the preceding sixteen months (Exhibit 7).
Among those who participate in their own employer group plan, however,
less than 10 percent had two employment changes.
We also used multivariate methods to compare employees who work in
firms that do not offer insurance with those who turn down an employer
offer and those who enroll in a group plan. Our model relates the prob-
ability of enrolling in an employer plan if offered the opportunity to do so
with the employee's wage, hours worked, age, number of employment
turnovers, sex, family status, eligibility for group coverage from another
family member, and firm size.15 Each of these characteristics is statistically
significant in explaining the decision to accept or reject an employer offer
of insurance. The predicted probability of participating in an employer

group plan if offered the opportunity for those who currently do not have
the option to do so was .75, which is quite close to the predicted probability
of .71 for those who have the opportunity to enroll in a plan but turn it
down. In contrast, the predicted probability of enrollment is .91 for those
who do enroll in an employer plan. This result indicates a similarity in the
economic and demographic profiles of persons in firms not offering insur-
ance and those who turn down an offer.
This similarity between employees in firms that do not offer insurance
and employees who turn down their employer plan for reasons other than
spousal coverage suggests that lack of demand for insurance by their workers
may be a factor in the employer's decision not to offer health benefits. Thus,
existing gaps in employment-based insurance may not only be a supply
problem connected with the small-group market; lack of demand may also
play a role. In fact, when we examine firms of any size, those that do not
offer insurance have an employee population that earns low wages, works
part time, is young, and experiences a lot of turnover--all characteristics of
lower insurance demand (Exhibit 8). In firms of any size that do not offer
insurance, roughly two-thirds of workers earn less than $7 per hour, whereas
roughly one-third of workers are low-wage earners in any size firm that
offers insurance. Controlling for firm size, workers in firms not offering
insurance are two to three times as likely to work part time as those in firms
that offer insurance (24-39 percent versus 11--14 percent, respectively).
About 25 percent of workers in firms of all sizes that do not offer insurance
are under age twenty-five, but firms that do offer insurance have only 15
percent young workers. And finally, there is roughly twice the likelihood of
turnover among employees in any size firm that does not offer insurance as
there is among employees in firms that do offer insurance.

Policy Implications
Most uninsured employees work for firms that do not offer them insur-
ance- This apparent lack of opportunity is concentrated in small groups; 69
percent of workers in firms that do not offer insurance are in firms of fewer
than twenty-five employees. This suggests that strategies to make insurance
more affordable to small business might fill some of the gaps. Nonetheless,
even if all small firms voluntarily responded to lower prices, the 31 percent
who work for larger firms that do not offer insurance would remain without
an offer of employer-sponsored insurance.
Because the problem of uninsured workers resides primarily in firms that
do not offer insurance, it first appears that the gaps stem from a supply
failure and that policy should encourage these employers to offer insurance.
Results of several recent pilot projects offering subsidized health insurance
to small, uninsured businesses, however, suggest that even with substantial
subsidies, few additional firms purchase coverage.16 Moreover, the closer
look provided by this DataWatch reveals that a large fraction of employees
in firms that do not offer insurance might not participate in an employer
plan, even if offered the opportunity to do so. They tend to be part-time,
low-wage workers who may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the
cost. In 1990, for the average firm, this share was about 15 percent of the
individual premium, or roughly $22 per month.17

earn less than $5 per hour or work fewer than thirty-five hours per week-
Even when eligible for an employer-sponsored health plan, these low-wage
or part-time workers are significantly less likely than other workers to
participate. Participation among eligible workers who work part time or
earn less than $5 per hour is only 59 percent. In contrast, among full-time
workers who earn more than $5 per hour, 91 percent take an employer plan
if they are eligible to participate. Tax credits or other subsidies may stimu-
late some additional purchase of insurance, although the average employer
already provides a large subsidy that many low-wage workers turn down.
Even a combination of small-group market reforms and individual subsi-
dies may prove insufficient to fill the current gap in employment-based
insurance. Clearly, the various mandate proposals can assume that the gap
will be filled. But what about their fairness? Mandates requiring the pur-
chase of group insurance may place an unwanted financial burden on the
currently uninsured, whose economic profile suggests that they are less
likely than the average worker to participate in employer-sponsored plans.

als in the matched sample did not differ from the full sample of employees in the May
survey. We weighted observations to adjust for respondents who were unable to report
whether their employer offered insurance (5 percent of employees in the matched
sample). We assumed that these missing values come proportionally from those who
are not offered group coverage, those who are ineligible for their group plan, and those

who turn down their group plan. We assumed that respondents unable to report
whether they were offered the opportunity to purchase group coverage were not covered
by a group plan, based on other research. G.L. Cafferata, "Knowledge of Their Health
Insurance Coverage by the Elderly," Medical Care (September 1984): 835-847; and
M.S. Marquis, "Consumers' Knowledge about Their Health Insurance Coverage,"
Health Care Financing Review (Fall 1983): 65-80. Our resulting estimate of employees
covered by their own employer group plan is consistent with other estimates.
7. This underestimates ineligibles newly employed at their current firm. We classified as
new employees only persons who were employed at the time of the May 1988 CPS but
reported being out of the labor force, out of work, or self-employed at the March 1988
CPS. We could not identify persons who changed employers between March and May.
8. Turnover is also a proxy for price to the employee and so affects supply and demand.
9. For similar results, see Health Insurance Association of America, Providing Employee
Health Benefits: How Firms Differ (Washington: HIAA, 1990).
10. These differences are due in part to differences among industries in firm size and union
status. Controlling for these factors, however, industry type is still significantly related
to the probability that insurance is offered.
11. We measure employment changes during calendar year 1987 from responses about the
number of different employers in 1987. Workers in the May 1988 sample who did not
have a job at the time of the March interview were attributed with one additional
turnover; if these individuals held a job at any time in 1987, they were attributed with
another turnover. This proxy measure counts employer changes in 1987 and labor force
status changes in 1988. It understates turnover because it does not count as turnover
entry into the labor force during 1987 nor changes in employer in 1988.
12. Some observers have pointed to sectoral shifts away from manufacturing, transporta-
tion, and government to trade and services and to decreasing unionization as explana-
tions for the increase in the uninsured over the past decade. J.T. Black, "Comment on
T h e Employed Uninsured and the Role of Public Policy'," Inquiry (Summer 1986):
209-212. However, our estimate shows that workers' access to employer insurance has
increased, compared with estimates from the late 1970s. A.C. Monheit et al., "The
Employed Uninsured and the Role of Public Policy," Inquiry (Winter 1985): 348-364.
13. This assumes a similar distribution of ages among the employees in each firm. In
contrast, the cost of insurance to an employer group consisting primarily of young
workers might be less than the cost to other groups, making the employer more willing
to offer insurance and the employee more willing to purchase it. However, we do not
have data on the average age of employees in each worker's firm.
14. This and the following exhibits do not include the 6 percent of workers who are
ineligible for employer-sponsored insurance but work in firms that offer this insurance
to other employees.
15. Our model is a logistic regression. It was estimated using the choices of a random half
of workers offered insurance by their employer; the remaining half of workers was
withheld as a forecast sample. The predicted probabilities are predictions for the
forecast group.
