Abstract
Virtual newsrooms have enormous potential: enabling journalists around the world to
pool their knowledge, skills and perspectives within joint projects, such as the Panama
Papers. These virtual newsrooms are supported by Online Collaborative Software
(OCS), the most popular of which is Slack. But although many of the world's top
news organisations now use Slack, there is no empirical research examining its impact
on workplace processes or culture. This article presents the results of a year-long
ethnographic study of a global digital news outlet, whose remote journalists collaborate,
almost exclusively, via Slack. We found that the platform deepened relationships and
enabled new creative practices across geographic regions. However, it also contributed
to the erasure of the line between private and professional spheres for workers, and
introduced new opportunities for management to shape newsroom culture. We argue
that the concept of `space' as developed by Harvey can helpfully frame the analysis of
these new, important digital platforms.

The Panama Papers, published in 2016, were a watershed in international journalistic
collaboration. Run by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism (ICIJ),
the investigation brought together journalists in 80 countries to examine more than
11
million leaked documents. This joint project was facilitated by a virtual newsroom,
which enabled journalists around the world to pool their knowledge, skills and perspec-
tives, even though few ever met in person (Hare, 2016). Gerard Ryle of the ICIJ explains,
Inside the virtual newsroom, the reporters could gather around the themes that were emerging
from the documents. Those interested in blood diamonds or exotic art, for instance, could share
information about how the offshore world was being used to hide the trade in both of those
commodities. (Ryle, 2016)
Virtual newsrooms are not just used for big bespoke investigations such as the Panama
Papers, however. The online collaborative software (OCS) packages on which they are
based are now cheap, widely available and increasingly used in the day-to-day opera-
tions of thousands of news organisations around the world. The most popular OCS today
is Slack, which was launched in August 2013 by Stewart Butterfield (the founder of
Flikr). By 2015, Slack had more than a million daily active users and, at just 2 years old,
was valued at $2.8billion ­ making it the fastest-growing business-to-business company
in history (Kiss, 2016). Its clients include Al Jazeera, BuzzFeed, Vox, The Times,
Medium, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, Quartz, Slate, NBC News, The Guardian,
AOL, ITV, Time Inc.
The architecture of Slack has been designed to echo social media and the informal,
collaborative norms of digital culture. The main dashboard is organized around a series
of perpetual chatrooms, each called a `channel' which users can customize and name
with a hashtag, for example, #HumanResources or #ITissues. Inside these channels, par-
ticipants can text, tag each other, share documents, photos, gifs and so on. Reviewing the
software for PC Mag, Duffy (2017) noted that teams often use Slack in more playful
ways than traditional work communications, for example, by dedicating channels to
#banter, #social, #news, #humor, or just plain old #watercooler.
Early adopters of Slack were enthusiastic about its ability to enable productivity, hori-
zontal collaboration, organisational transparency and team morale (Owen, 2015; Perkel,
2017). Some believe that it may create more democratic and egalitarian work conditions
(Kiss, 2016), while others worry about its impact on productivity (Jeffries, 2016).
However, these observations are anecdotal, consisting of blogs and industry commen-
tary, rather than empirical academic studies. Moreover, the existing commentary has
tended to focus on news outlets that use Slack in addition to their physical newsroom(s).
It has not explored the far more radical potential of Slack as a replacement for physical
newsrooms. This is a notable oversight given (1) the intense economic pressures on jour-
nalism and the massive cost-cutting potential of a virtual newsroom. And (2) the large
number of casually contracted or remotely employed journalists who don't have access
to a physical newsroom.
This article looks at two broad questions. First, how might Slack change and influence
journalistic practice? Second, how can we theorise and research these platforms? We
examined these questions through extensive ethnographic observations and semi-struc-
tured interviews. We had unprecedented access to complete a year of ethnographic work
Bunce et al. 3383
in the Slack account of a global, digital only news outlet called IRIN. We also inter-
viewed all the journalists working at the newsroom.
Our research found that Slack deepened relationships between journalists and enabled
new creative practices across geographic regions. However, it also contributed to the
erasure of the line between private and professional spheres for workers, and introduced
new opportunities for management to shape newsroom culture. We argue that the con-
cept of `space' as developed by David Harvey can helpfully frame the analysis of these
new, important digital platforms. In the literature review that follows, we expand on this
approach, and integrate the discussion with industry commentary about OCS and Slack.
Journalistic practice in digital spaces
Virtual newsrooms can be considered `spaces'in the sense that geographers use the term:
a social construction that is continuously produced and reproduced by its users (e.g.
Lefebvre, 1991). Harvey (2006), one of the most prominent theorists of space, draws a
highly influential distinction between absolute space, relative space and relational space.
Journalism researchers have started to use this distinction to inform their analyses of
newsrooms, news practices, and technological change (e.g. Robinson, 2011; Usher,
2015; Zaman, 2013). We argue that it is a particularly helpful for analysing virtual news-
rooms because it shifts the focus beyond the physical to consider the properties of space
more generally, including how digital platforms may facilitate some experiences, rela-
tionships and power dynamics over others (see also Robinson and Metzler, 2016).
Importantly, it does not privilege either physical space or digital space but sees these
existing in tension with one another.
In Harvey's (2006) schema, absolute space refers to the physical, material existence
of something that can be counted, measured, observed. It is in this sense that virtual
newsrooms are, of course, very different from physical newsrooms. The physical news-
room has desks, chairs, offices, meeting rooms, office coolers and so on with physical,
material properties. Virtual newsrooms, by contrast, exist via a device, and can be
accessed from anywhere that has Internet access.
The second type of space ­ `relative space'­ draws our attention to perspective; it sug-
gests that a space means different things to people depending on their situation. This may
be because of distance (how far an individual is from a particular space), or it might reflect
an individual's personal characteristics or resources. For example, a virtual newsroom
may mean something different to a user who has a slow Internet connection, is logging in
from a busy family holiday, has a precarious employment contract, or who cannot fluently
communicate in the lingua franca. Relative space reminds us that distance and resources
may still matter ­ even when users see the same text on their device screens.
Initial commentary suggests that the introduction of Slack can have a profound impact
on relative space in the newsroom. Most significantly, because it provides a central locus
and meeting point that all journalists can access, regardless of their location. Journalists
who work remotely from traditional, physical newsrooms have described feeling
estranged from the culture and comradery of their organisation, and less able to collabo-
rate and share information (e.g. Hannerz, 2004). In addition, remote journalists may not
be exposed to the daily interactions that have been identified as pivotal for sharing and
solidifying organisational norms (e.g. Breed, 1955).
3384 new media & society 20(9)
Slack provides a virtual newsroom that is `equidistant' for all participants, and this
may increase collaboration between remote journalists. The platform also brings journal-
ists into more constant exposure with one another as well as `organisational chatter',
which may support the development of team culture and norms. In an article for the
Neiman Foundation, Owen (2015) asked eight editors how Slack had changed their
organisational work processes. The editors stated that it increased journalistic collabora-
tion and helped foster a sense of team among previously dislocated workers. As one
commented, `Slack is one of the threads that holds our internationally distributed teams
together. We use it ... to foster team-building and camaraderie with remote colleagues'.
In a similar vein, Alexis Madrigal, the editor-in-chief at Fusion states, `We're a big
organisation with offices in Miami and New York, Oakland and L.A. It's a lot of people
to keep track of, so Slack is kind of our national office in the cloud' (Owen, 2015).
The third property of space in Harvey's schema is `relational'; spaces makes some
relationships possible, and these relationships, in turn, shape what a space means to
users. In a physical newsroom, for example, the location of journalists can influence their
relationships with one another, and their work processes (e.g. Josephi, 1998). Similarly,
research has shown that digital platforms can transform the relational properties of news-
rooms. Robinson (2011), for example, finds that online spaces operated as extensions of
the physical newsroom, and that relationships that develop in `virtual platforms'translate
into the physical newsroom:
Cliques formed electronically; jokes passed through the newsroom via text messages, leaving
out those who did not `text' or check their e-mail constantly. Digitally flexible workers
gravitated toward each other (virtually), whereas traditionalists found support for each other (in
physical spaces). (2011:1132)
While there has been no empirical academic research on Slack's impact on relation-
ships, industry commentary suggests that it can create closely bonded teams. Writing for
Slate magazine, Hess (2015) argues that, because Slack's interface resembles social
media, bonds form faster: `Chatting with your co-workers in the same way you commu-
nicate with your friends helps accelerate the office bond ... running jokes lead to a shared
history, and a shared history is culture' (see also Rosenberg, 2015).
One of the most important relationships in the newsroom is that between management
and journalists. Researchers have argued that digital communication can make this rela-
tionship less hierarchical (Deuze, 2007; Gurstein, 2001) because it enables simultaneous
communication and puts more information in the public domain, increasing transpar-
ency. Slack (the company) claims that its platform is more egalitarian than email. As
Leah Reich, the in-house user researcher at Slack writes,
Email is hierarchical and compartmentalized, and great for political manoeuvering. Blind
copying, or the bcc, is an example of that: your boss could be silently copied into an email
chain. Email allows the sender to choose who to send information to, and who to exclude ...
[Slack by contrast is] radical collaboration, a different way of working and thinking. (Quoted
in Kiss, 2016)
But digital platforms also open up more opportunity for managerial surveillance, and
may create unreasonable labour demands and expectations (Loeschner, 2016; Rosenberg,
Bunce et al. 3385
2015) These platforms often track when users are online and active, and make this infor-
mation available to others. In his famous metaphor of the Panopticon prison, Foucault
argues that the mere act of observation can lead individuals to self-discipline: individuals
internalize power and therefore subject themselves to norms without the need for force
(Foucault, 1991). As a result, it is possible that Slack may extend the indirect influence
of management. It may also place more pressure on workers, as it puts the responsibility
to be up to speed on individuals as opposed to requiring scheduled time and meetings to
read or discuss work.
In one of the few studies to examine the management of remote journalists via digital
platforms, Hendrickson (2009) analyses journalists at Jezebel who collaborate through
instant messaging (IM). The study finds that IM increased lateral, egalitarian decision
making at the outlet. But Hendrickson notes that management continued to wield signifi-
cant control over news processes and organisational culture, and this fact was sometimes
veiled by the seemingly casual communications taking place on IM. It is unclear whether
these dynamics would prevail on Slack and other OCS, which are group communication
tools, rather than one to one messaging.
Harvey (2006) argues that these three properties of space exist in tension, and can
evolve: `it is impossible to disentangle space from time ... A wide variety of disparate
influences swirling over space in the past, present and future concentrate and congeal at
a certain point to define the nature of that point' (p. 274). As such, it's important that we
pay attention to how norms, relationships and uses of a platform can change over time.
Harvey's triptych helps focus our study of virtual newsrooms by identifying specific
characteristics that these spaces may possess. Following this literature, and the early
commentary on Slack, our study asks three specific research questions. First, how did the
journalists at IRIN use Slack? Here, we are interested in its absolute properties: when
and how they use it, what kind of messages did they send? Second, did Slack change the
journalists' perception of physical distance? Here, we are interested in the impact of
Slack on relative space ­ did it change the journalists access to newsroom and its conver-
sations, and increase their ability to collaborate? Third, how does Slack shape relation-
ships at the news organisation? Here, we are interested in Slack as a relational space.
Following the literature, we are particularly interested in how it may have shaped the
relationships between journalists and each other, as well as with their managers.
The following section introduces the case study before the methods are outlined.
The case study: IRIN
IRIN is the world's oldest and largest dedicated humanitarian newswire. For its first
19years, it operated under the umbrella of the United Nations. In January 2015, it became
an independent, not for profit, media outlet funded by charitable donations, grants and
philanthropy. The organisation describes itself as providing the `Inside story on emer-
gencies', covering humanitarian events and issues around the globe. IRIN are digital
only; stories are published on their website, and they have a large social media
presence.
The number, location and job title of employees fluctuated throughout the study but,
generally speaking, consisted of 12 employees based in 7 countries. This included
between 8 and 10 full-time editorial staff who were spread around the world, with small,
3386 new media & society 20(9)
informal clusters of journalists in London and Nairobi. These journalists write content,
as well as commission and edit the work of a large network of freelance journalists.
IRIN is a `virtual team'. That is, a group of people `who work interdependently with
shared purpose across space, time, and organisation boundaries using technology to
communicate and collaborate' (Lipnack and Stamps, 2000: 18). All daily communica-
tions were done via digital platforms. Slack was introduced at IRIN in January 2015, and
became the primary platform for internal communications. Prior to this, employees had
relied on email, which was generally used along vertical lines, with journalists in the
field pitching and reporting "up" to regional editors.
In addition to Slack, the journalists communicated in a group skype call each morning
during the working week. These meetings vary from quick conversations where each
journalist listed their news stories, through to lengthy debates about the purposes of their
organisation, reflecting on questions like, `what is humanitarianism?' During the study,
the team also experimented with a once weekly strategy skype call. However, poor
Internet connections frequently interrupted these longer meetings, and they were discon-
tinued. Outside the morning skype call, almost all internal communications took place
through Slack.
Methods
This article draws on data collected as part of a larger research project on humanitarian
journalism (Scott, Bunce, Wright 2017a, 2017b). As part of this research, we spent a year
studying IRIN. Our project sought to explore all the factors that shaped the organisa-
tion's news production, from their business model and journalistic niche, to the news
values of individual journalists. We were particularly interested in how the move from
United Nations funding to independent charitable status might shape humanitarian news
outputs. The founding editor was also interested in this question and invited us to come,
as independent researchers, to observe the transition. We made this arrangement in
December 2014, and closely studied the organisation through 2015 and 2016. Early in
the research, we realized that Slack had become a crucial tool at the organisation, and we
decided to add the role and impact of this digital platform as an additional focus in our
research.
We explored the topic through interviews and ethnographic observations.Atotal of 25
semi-structured interviews lasting between 30 and 90 minutes were conducted with all
contracted staff at the news outlet. Every staff member (see Table 1) was interviewed at
least once, including managers, journalists, and the organisation's administrator. Long-
serving members of staff were interviewed at least every 6 months, new members of staff
were interviewed a month after taking up the job, and those leaving were interviewed
shortly after their departure.
A large number of interviews were done face to face in February 2015 when the IRIN
team held a rare, in person meet up ­ their first as an independent news organisation. The
remainder were primarily done by skype. In interviews, we asked the journalists to
reflect on their use of Slack, as well as their relationships with one another and work
processes. All the interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed for the journal-
ist's perception of Slack and its impact on their relationships, and work practices.
Bunce et al. 3387
We also conducted extensive ethnographic observations in the news outlet's Slack
newsroom. We were given the login details at the same time as the journalists in January
2015, when the organisations started using the platform. Every two or three days through-
out the study period, we would observe the journalists on Slack, for anything from 15
minutes to several hours. The goal of these observations was to understand how the
journalists interacted in live time: `to capture the real-time interactions and dialogue that
you can never truly reconstruct later'(Robinson and Metzler, 2016: 455­456). We would
also read back over the messages that had been sent since we last logged in, taking notes
on any interactions relevant to our research questions. These observations helped us tri-
angulate the statements journalists made in interviews.
We also completed ethnographic observations in the weekday editorial meetings held
on skype. We observed approximately four daily editorial meetings and one weekly plan-
ning meeting each month, between January 2015 and November 2015: amounting to a
total of 47 meetings, lasting between 20 and 60 minutes each. Finally, we attended a
2-day annual strategy meeting held face to face with the IRIN team in London in February
2015. In these fora, we were able to observe the journalists describe their use and percep-
tion of Slack.
One limitation of our study was that we could not observe private one-to one messag-
ing on Slack (`Dark Slack', as we came to call it). We attempted to address this by asking
our interviewees to describe how and when they chose to use private rather than public
channels. A second, more conceptual limitation concerned the challenge of establishing
the impact Slack has on production practices. We do not have counterfactual data: we do
not know what the outlet's work practices would have looked like had they not introduced
the platform. However, there were many long-standing employees in the company who
could describe the practices prior to the introduction of Slack. Moreover, our study began
at the same time that the organisation started using Slack, meaning that we could observe
the journalists initial experimentation, learning, and normalization of the platform, as well
as how they talked about it in their editorial meetings throughout this process.

RQ 1: How do journalists use Slack?
This section begins by outlining the basic architecture of Slack, as it was used by IRIN,
and the functions that it served. Here, we are interested in its absolute properties: when
and how they use it, what kind of messages did they send? This section provides context
for the rest of the study as well as, we hope, providing descriptive information that may
be helpful for researchers examining Slack in other contexts.
IRIN used Slack as a professional tool to coordinate and collaborate on news produc-
tion. The journalists all had Slack on their phone and laptops, and with staff in multiple
time zones, there was almost always someone online. The majority of interactions were
professional in their topic and tone, and focused on the news production process, but there
was the occasional more light-hearted discussion and banter. During the study period, the
journalists set up and used 21 channels. These were primarily set up by the IRIN managers
­ the managing editor and chief executive, and, at their instruction, the admin team. The
below list outlines the key functions that journalists used these channels for
1. Sharing and developing story ideas. Slack was used to pitch and develop story
ideas. This was done on three channels in particular: #dailymeetings #storyideas
and #intheworks. When there was a very big story, the journalists set up a specific
channel to manage the reporting. This happened twice during the study, in both
instances in the wake of natural disasters. This allowed for quick exchanges of
information about what was happening, almost like a live newsblog (How many
are hurt? Is the airport open?). This information was then used directly in news
outputs, particularly a live rolling blog on IRIN's website. It was also used to
coordinate the news response and reduce the duplication of effort.
2. Framing and editing decisions took place in a number of channels, including
#headlines, where journalists would ask for input and brainstorm the wording of
story headlines. In #style, they would clarify the use of terms and debate semantic
issues. #Photos was used to discuss accompanying images, and #socialmedia
looked at how to promote and send out news.
3. Sharing audience responses ­ the IRIN journalists also use Slack to share notes
on the reception of stories. For example, the #feedback channel where they
relayed audience comments, and #impact which noted when IRIN content was
used or shared by important people or policy documents.
4. Organisational logistics ­ the journalists used Slack to note details such as their leave
dates, IT troubles, and payment issues under the channel #admin and #itandweb.
Several of the core IRIN team are commissioning editors, and they posted details
about available freelancers, location and payment details in #stringers.
5. Likes and dislikes ­ two channels were dedicated to sharing news stories, ideas
and announcements that the journalists either liked (#thingswelike) or didn't
(#thingswedontlikemuch). These discussed things that happened in the humani-
tarian sector generally, and were also used to praise, critique or parody other
organisation's coverage.
6. Miscellaneous - a #general channel captured everything else that was important,
and a #random channel captured everything else that was unimportant (a funny
gif from the Internet).
Bunce et al. 3389
In addition to these public channels, the journalists used private messaging through-
out the day. In interviews, the journalists stated that they primarily used messaging to
deal with the more specific and technical elements of news production ­ the `nitty gritty
editorial stuff' (Interview, 20 February 2015) such as checking the details of a source, or
asking when a photo would arrive; `rather than put it out on a general channel which just
clogs up that channel, if it's kind of how you're getting along with that story ... details'
(Interview, 22 May 2015). The editors and journalists also described using private mes-
saging for more sensitive conversations, for example, to provide feedback to journalists
on their stories when this was delicate or critical, or to check in on their friends.
Generally speaking, the journalists thought that Slack led to efficiency gains. One
stated, `it's useful also to have all those different ... parallel conversations happening in
different rooms, and channels' (Interview, 16 February 2016). But some felt that this
came at a cost in terms of erasing the dividing line between private and professional time
(discussed further below).
Some found the platform highly addictive and struggled to turn it off in weekends and
evenings. One journalist returning from holiday asked, for example,
Journalist 1: What did I miss? What excitement?
Journalists 2:
I saw your green button on Slack a few times. I was worried that you
were actually tuning in, in your absence.
Journalist 1: Well, I would say, with half an ear; it's hard to turn off
(Editorial meeting 2016).
Reflecting on this in an editorial skype, a journalist coined the phrase, `Slack is crack'.
During the workday, some also found the omnipotence of the chat distracting:
Sometimes you need just a couple of hours just to shut everything off ... to be productive, and
all these collaborations sometimes, you know, especially with the headlines channels and things
like that, everyone wants to chip in you can get sucked into the conversations, you know, `cos
anything's better than writing, right?
Part of the danger, the journalist believed, was that `you can kid yourself you're work-
ing if you're contributing to a conversation in Slack' (Interview, 20 February 2015).
Interestingly, a similar observation was made at the news outlet Slate, where journalists
found that chatting on the platform `satiated' their desire to publish news articles (Hess,
2015). The managing editor at IRIN shared the concerns of staff that Slack may get in the
way of creative work, and told the team:
For the future projects, we need to get back to adding kind of a unique edge to what we're doing
... And if that means for half a day a week you disconnect from Slack and the news cycle, go
and meet people, that's fine. (Team skype meeting, 14 April 2015)
RQ2: Did Slack increase connection and collaboration
across geographic distance?
Initial commentary suggests that the introduction of Slack can have a profound impact
on relative space in the newsroom. In particular, it provides a central platform for
3390 new media & society 20(9)
geographically dispersed journalists that may foster connection and collaboration. We
found this was the case at IRIN, where Slack supported extensive collaboration across
remote geographic locations. This included, first, logistical collaboration: the journalists
frequently asked their colleagues around the world for information and advice on every-
thing from the name of contacts to recommendations for transport; it was a `hive mind',
where individuals could draw on the knowledge of the group. Second, it included crea-
tive collaboration around story ideas and angles. It was common for one journalist to
post an idea and others to quickly chip in, suggesting new angles and leads. Notably, this
collaboration often took place between journalists who were geographically remote. The
following quite typical exchange, for example, involved three journalists: one in
Bangkok, one in London, and one in Oxford (UK):
Journalist 1: 
I don't know if there's an angle in this for us yet, but ... our new (and
very good) string in kabul is working on a story about people fleeing
Afghanistan to Europe ...
Journalist 2: i
f it's of interest the Afghan family I helped in Lesbos had lost their
middle son while crossing the border out of Iran ... have the story and
pictures
Journalist 3: 
I had a pitch last week from [another stringer] who wants to do some-
thing focused on Afghans' journey through Europe which tends to be
rougher than for the Syrians so maybe we can meld the two or run
them as a series.
(Slack, 26 October 2015)
This discussion, and many like it, resulted in a thematic story that brought together
facts and sources from different regions of the world. This is a notable observation, given
that one of the biggest criticisms of international news content is its sporadic, episodic
nature. Stephen Ward argues that the challenges facing the world ­ environmental, eco-
nomic, political and social ­ do not take place in isolation; as such, one of international
journalism's key jobs is to connect dots and identify patterns across regions (Ward,
2010). Our study suggests that Slack can help disassociated teams do exactly this.
Prior to the introduction of Slack, physical distance had a greater impact on news-
work: trans-bureau collaboration and information sharing was rare. Journalists worked
independently on their region or beat, and generally pitched `up' via email to an editor,
who was the only person with oversight of the daily output, meaning far less scope for
horizontal collaboration. The Managing Editor, who had worked at IRIN for 5 years prior
to Slack's introduction described the arrangement:
Before we each worked in isolation, and now someone has an idea, they'll put it on Slack,
someone from a different bureau will say `Oh yeah, I noticed a similar trend here' or `Hey, you
should totally talk to this guy' or `Does anyone have a contact for x?' so I feel we're all a little
bit more working as a team. (23 June 2015)
Quick fire brainstorming was particularly common in the #headline channel, where
journalists rapidly suggested phrases, tweaking and building on each others' ideas, as
illustrated in the following exchange between three journalists spread between Nairobi,
London and Oxford:
Bunce et al. 3391
Journalist 1:
Photo feature on survivor stories who were rescued in the med. what
shall we call it? Rescued in the Mediterranean: `We thank God we are
alive!?'...
Journalist 2: can't we be more narrative?
Journalist 1: In a headline?
Journalist 2:
Reportage: After days at sea, shipwreck survivors turn up alive on
Europe's shores or whatever
Journalist 1: Crossing the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy: survival stories...
Journalist 3: 
Rescued! Survivors recount Med ordeal (we use so many question
marks, time to mix up the punctuation a bit)
Journalist 1: 
Rescued! From shipwreck to safety If you can call a deflating dingy a
shipwreck ...
Journalists 3: that'll do (Slack, 8 May 2015).
These frequent interactions also helped the journalists develop organisational norms
just as a physical newsroom may do (e.g. Breed, 1955). During our study, IRIN was in a
particular state of flux. As noted above, the outlet had become independent from the
United Nations, and was searching for new funding streams as well as a new, independ-
ent identify. This involved debates from board level down about IRIN's purpose and
values. Against this backdrop, Slack was a platform where journalists could debate the
boundaries of their news beat, and establish reporting norms. Journalists would post a
story idea, and ask the group, `is it humanitarian enough?', `is this too inside baseball?'
or `how do I do this in an IRIN-ish way?'
These debates about the boundaries of the newsbeat were then visible to other journal-
ists and new hires, who could use Slack to help them `learn the ropes' ­ just as Perkel
(2017) described a lab of scientists using the platform. In addition, they could message
to quickly seek clarification on small points. One journalist described a new hire learning
the boundaries of the beat: `his private messages are about ... the distinction between
humanitarian and development and, you know, and that kind of murky line ... he seems
to have fitted in very quickly and very well' (Interview, 1 October 2015).
These conversations ­ like many of the interactions on Slack ­ would be extremely
challenging or frustrating to have by email, and would likely be considered too minor to
discus in the skype editorial meeting, particularly if there was trouble with the Internet
connection. As one journalist commented, `everyone's spread out all over the world ­ so
we use Slack really to avoid those endless emails which don't really work. Instead, eve-
ryone can communicate instantly on streamlined themes'(12 May 2016). In other words,
Slack brought journalists in to the same `room' in a way that other technological plat-
forms had not previously done. In doing so, it changed the properties of relative space at
IRIN.
Although Slack facilitated collaboration across distance, the location that journalists
accessed the platform from continued to matter. Counter-intuitively perhaps, the journal-
ists with the worst Internet connections found Slack the most valuable. Two journalists
­ one in West Africa, and one in South East Asia - had constant issues with their Internet
and were rarely able to join the editorial skype conference calls. For these journalists,
Slack was the only platform (outside of email) where they interacted with colleagues.
One noted: `group calls on skype were a disaster, but for the most part, even if I couldn't
3392 new media & society 20(9)
actually participate on the group calls, usually after [I would] be talking via Slack'.
(Interview, 1 July 2015).
By contrast, a cluster of journalists based in London would sometimes work together
in the lounge of a flat. This created a small, more closely knit network with additional
layers of interaction above and beyond Slack. This group often included IRIN's editor
and manager, and members of the admin team. A journalist who had spent time working
in both London and remotely felt this made a big difference:
The thing on Slack that's difficult is ... [you] haven't quite got that feeling of `We're all working
together on this one project' ... when things have worked is when you had everybody kind of
chipping in and helping out, and that really in the London office was much better. (Interview, 1
October 2015)
There was also a strong connection between location and activity level, which meant
that geography continued to shape the user experience. It is possible to search the Slack
archives for the handles of the IRIN employees, and see the number of times each user
posted a public message or was publicly `tagged' by another user. These searches show
that employees based in the UK produced more than half of all the posts on Slack during
our study (see Figure 1), meaning that Slack was busiest in the working hours of British
Standard Time. By contrast, few messages were sent when the Asia correspondent was
online, meaning less opportunity to collaborate in live time.
These searches also identified big differences between how individual journalists
used the platform. The Lebanon-based correspondent accounted for 14% of the handles
on Slack (almost the same percentage as four employees in Kenya combined). The
Senegal-based correspondent, by contrast, posted only 4%. In interviews, these two jour-
nalists suggested a number of factors behind their differing use of Slack. This included
the challenges of Internet and electricity where they were based, the amount of travel
they did for work, whether or not they were working on projects with other journalists,
and their subjective enjoyment of online chat.
These findings further illustrate the appropriateness of using Harvey's (2006) con-
cept of space to analyse OCS. As Harvey contends, space is inherently relative, and
its meaning and significance can vary between individuals. Slack supported connec-
tion and collaboration ­ which reduced the impact of physical distance on the news
culture. But this did not mean the journalists had identical experiences of the space.
Factors such as time zones and Internet connectivity ­ in addition to personal prefer-
ences ­ continued to influence their experience and feelings about the virtual
newsroom.
RQ3: How does Slack shape relationships in the news
organisation?
Harvey argues that one of the key characteristics of space is relational; spaces make
some relationships possible and these relationships, in turn, shape what a space means to
users. In our final results section, we consider the way that Slack shaped relationships
between journalists, as well as management at IRIN.
Bunce et al. 3393
The industry commentary suggested that Slack may help build relationships between
workers. This is what we observed at IRIN. Almost every journalist commented that
Slack helped them feel closer to their colleagues, and that it sparked and solidified friend-
ships that would not exist otherwise. One praised the platform for helping him `have
relationships with all of the people, direct relationships with all of the people in every
desk' ­ despite having not met in person (Interview, 30 January 2015). The journalists
chatted on Slack throughout the workday ­ interacting far more than they had in the past.
As one commented, `it was a way of maintaining [connections]. Obviously not quite the
same as all being in the same room but better than ... corresponding only on email cause
email's not real-time' (Interview 16 February 2016). These comments echo the deep
research literature showing that the widespread adoption of any technology can promote
new connective patterns among formerly disassociated workers (e.g. Haythornthwaite,
2006).
More broadly, Slack helped create a team identity at IRIN because conversations that
might have been one-to-one in the past were now communal. One user commented,
That's what I'm loving about this new IRIN, is that a lot of that [is] happening on the public
channels like `Oh, happy birthday'or `Hey, did you see ha ha', a lot of that seems to be a shared
experience across the whole team, which I've found really refreshing. (Interview, 23 June
2015)
Interactions on Slack were often light-hearted; a #random channel was used to share
weird and wonderful things from the Internet, for example, and one senior journalist
Figure 1. Location of employees messaging / tagged on Slack.1
3394 new media & society 20(9)
enjoyed customizing the welcome message to make fun of his colleagues. A journalist
described this banter as supporting `nice little bits of bonding'(Interview, 22 May 2015).
Slack improved team spirit, as the duty editor told the Board members at the annual
meeting: `It's very good for feedback and, generally, for the morale of the team, so that
everyone knows they're part of something, and they can interact on it, rather than just
feeling isolated. It's really become quite an essential tool' (12 May 2016).
Slack also became an important space for mediating the relationship between the
manager and the journalists. Several commentators have predicted that Slack will create
more egalitarian or lateral power structure (e.g. Kiss, 2016). Our findings on this ques-
tion were mixed. As noted above, the journalists did have more opportunity to contribute
to creative practice at the news outlet than they had in the past. There was, for example,
a lot of peer-to-peer discussion around how the humanitarian news beat should be
defined. This contrasts with the previous `spoke and wheel' arrangement at the organisa-
tion, where journalists tended to communicate up to their editor rather than laterally.
In addition, interactions on Slack were largely informal and all members felt they
could contribute to conversations. Indeed, such was the egalitarian nature, that there
were occasions when it wasn't clear who was in charge. Early in the study, for example,
a breaking news story took place over a weekend. The editor posted some ideas on Slack,
and assumed the journalists would act on these. This was not clear to the journalists,
some of whom did not see the posts or recognize them as a request. As one commented
afterwards, `I completely understand that this is a breaking news story, but who's in
charge?... If you wanted to do something, call' (Interview, 22 May 2015). If the same
comments had been made in an editorial meeting, the journalists would likely have rec-
ognized them as instructions, suggesting that they do not see Slack as a particularly
hierarchical space.
Another way that Slack appears to support more egalitarian working conditions is that
it provides a permanent platform for management to share information about strategic
decisions and key performance indicators. For example, monthly progress reports were
shared on IRIN's Slack, showing which stories had performed well. An admin stated that
`It's also shared with the team to help them better understand what's working online,
what's popular and how well we've done at the end of each month' (Interview, 29 May
2015). This may increase organisational transparency. But it is important to remember
that information can also be strategically shared (or withheld) as a form of discipline ­
encouraging journalists to focus on particular ideas or measurements, such as the audi-
ence metrics. Thus, although Slack has the potential to create a `flattening' of hierarchy
through its increased transparency (Rosenberg, 2015), this may not be how it operates in
practice.
Our study also found that Slack creates opportunities for managerial teams to shape
group culture and practice. Indeed, top-down management is inherent in the platform's
architecture. Although most journalists could, in practice, set up a new channel, at IRIN
this was generally done by senior staff. The existence of these channels may then inform
the range of topics that are discussed, moving conversations towards managerial priori-
ties. For example, `impact' is an important consideration for non-profit news organisa-
tions such as IRIN that seek funding from private foundations and governments. These
news outlets are often required to demonstrate the impact of their journalism in order to
Bunce et al. 3395
secure grants. Because of the importance of impact to the managers at IRIN, there was a
Slack channel dedicated to measuring it, which sent a clear signal to journalists about its
importance. As one journalists had noticed, `impact is to be...trumpeted, that's why
there's an impact channel on Slack ­ the more impact the better' (Interview, 16 February
2016).
In addition, Slack provides a permanent platform for managers to give `public' praise
and censure to their employees, which constitutes an important form of influence in the
digital newsroom (Bunce, 2017). Editors praise journalists and articles they deem appro-
priate, and criticize those which are not, sending messages about organisational priori-
ties. The managing editor, for example, describes using Slack to give an individual's
feedback publically in an attempt to change behaviour across the organisation: `when it's
more critical stuff ... you know "This article, it really didn't work for me" ... I intention-
ally made that public so that we can all engage in that discussion' (Interview, 23 May
2015). Slack was also used to send specific praise to stories that were doing well. Several
journalists were sensitive about the use of Slack for these `herograms'that elevated some
work (and journalists) above others.
Finally and importantly, the omnipresence of Slack was also perceived by some staff
as a form of surveillance and a source of stress. The name of each user is listed on the left
hand bar with a small dot indicating whether they are online and available. One journalist
commented,
I do end up working very late and being on there all the time and I, I genuinely don't know
whether that's a kind of ... a peer pressure thing. It almost becomes a kind of unconscious,
`macho-er than thou type thing ... you see people that were on there from ten or midnight ... I
think that puts a greater pressure on the [individual] to time-manage themselves and to set their
own boundaries. (Interview, 22 May 2015)
This was not necessarily the intention of management. Indeed, as noted above, the
managing editor had told IRIN employees to leave Slack if they needed space to think or
more time to do more `on the ground' investigations. Nonetheless ­ as Foucault argues
­ the simple act of monitoring can result in employees self-policing their own behaviour;
the sense of being visible can encourage journalists to comply with managerial priorities,
without needing to be asked. This pressure may be felt particularly strongly by workers
on casual contrasts, worried about their future employment.
In sum, then, Slack had a significant impact on relationships at IRIN. First, because it
made journalists feel a lot closer and more connected to one another. Its impact on the
relationship between journalists and management was more ambiguous. On the one
hand, it opened up the possibility for more horizontal conversations about important
issues at the organisation. For the first time, journalists could have extensive conversa-
tions with one another, not just their editors and line managers. On the other hand, man-
agement could use the constant platform to send public messages of praise and censure.
And because the manager and administrative team tend to control the settings, there is
scope to push conversations in certain directions. As Harvey suggests, one of the most
important properties of any space, such as Slack, is the way in which it changes and
shapes relationships.

Discussion and conclusion
This article has provided the first analysis of how remotely working journalists collabo-
rate in a virtual newsroom supported by Online Collaborative Software. Our year-long
observations and interviews found that this virtual space supported many of the functions
that a traditional, place-based newsroom does. The journalists at IRIN used Slack to share
ideas and make news production decisions, and they developed friendships and organisa-
tional norms through its channels. The team felt more connected, collaboration increased
and it supported the production of cross-boundary, global journalism. Slack also created
more opportunities for managerial incursion, and pressure on journalistic time.
IRIN is just one news organisation. Their geographic spread, employees and market
niche are all unique. In particular, IRIN journalists are highly specialized, have a colle-
giate respect for each other's expertise, and they adopted Slack very comprehensively:
using it to replace almost all internal communication. These variables may create a
unique experience of Slack. Our study cannot, therefore, reach firm conclusions about
the impact the introduction of Slack will have in different contexts. Rather, this study
operates as a `revelatory' case study (Yin, 2003: 42), including descriptive information
that can be tested in future work. It would be helpful to see future research testing our
findings in other team dynamics, and exploring whether different digital layouts and
platforms ­ both within Slack and on other OCS ­ may support different practices.
More theoretically, our article has suggested how other researchers might study and
theorize these platforms in the future. We have argued that the tripartite concept of space,
as developed by Harvey, is a useful theoretical framework for analysing OCS. As Harvey
argues, and our research has demonstrated, a space like Slack has absolute, relative and
relational properties, and examining these helps us understand what a space means to
participants. This approach has a number of strengths.
First, by drawing attention to relative space, we are reminded that individuals use and
experience technology differently from one another. As we saw at IRIN, some individu-
als were prolific users of Slack, others were not; some loved it, others found it a source
of stress. We cannot assume that the impact of new technology will be consistent across
the organisation ­ a fact that can be overlooked in the journalism literature that often
focuses on the macro and meso level of organisational practice (Schudson, 2003).
Second, Harvey posits that spaces do not exist independently of how people make use
of them, and the relationships they facilitate. Our study has illustrated how digital plat-
forms may create new power dynamics; and suggested that these power dynamics may
reside in the very architecture of the space, and the categories into which users must
place their thoughts before being able to articulate them to other users. Our research adds
further evidence to Hendrickson's (2009) contention that this casual and chatty appear-
ance can veil managerial influence on these platforms.
Finally, Harvey's approach is sensitive to temporal dynamics. Many of our observa-
tions related to the users' experience of time ­ its impact on productivity and wasted
time; its blurring of the boundaries between personal time and professional time; the
manner in which time zones created different `types' of Slack for users. It is crucial that
we take these into account if we are to understand what a platform means to users. As
Harvey (2006) writes, `it is impossible to disentangle space from time ... A wide variety
Bunce et al. 3397
of disparate influences swirling over space in the past, present and future concentrate and
congeal at a certain point to define the nature of that point' (p. 274).
It is worth underlining a final point: the remarkable potential of Slack and other OCS
as research sites. It may be difficult to access an organisation's virtual newsroom as news
organisations are often sensitive about sharing access to internal communications with
ethnographers (Robinson and Metzler, 2016: 456). However, where this is achieved, the
sheer quantity and depth of data, from an ethnographic point of view, is phenomenal.
Researchers can observe multiple simultaneous interactions, rather than being limited to
one physical position in the newsroom. And significantly, Slack is already in textual
form. This makes it practical to study very large quantities of communication using con-
tent analysis tools. Researchers can quantify interactions, relationships and change over
time: what words are used, in proximity to which others, who speaks to whom, what
topics they address and so on. This enables an exciting new lens to view journalistic
production. As well as altering journalism practices, Slack may change the way research-
ers study them.
