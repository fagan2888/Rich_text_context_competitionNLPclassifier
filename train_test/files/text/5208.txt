In cross-cultural research measuring toddlers'temperaments, it
is necessary to have a culture-free psychometric tool.Aculture-
free tool must also minimize construct, method, and item bias
(He & van de Vijver, 2012; Van de Vijver & Tanzer, 2004). If
these sources of bias are eliminated, the instrument used to
measure cultural differences in temperament can be considered
equivalent across cultures. If bias is not eliminated, the tool
cannot be considered equivalent and the differences in the mea-
surement scores may stem from contamination by evaluators'
cultural beliefs and/or expectations of children rather than
reflecting differences in the toddlers'temperaments.
The present study sought to eliminate method bias using
the same sample attributes and the same form of question-
naire as the original Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire
(ECBQ). The issue of item bias was addressed by using an
appropriate translation method. However, as it was not clear
if construct bias existed, this bias will be evaluated using
social desirability described below.
Even after these biases are eliminated, the mean score level
and the factor structure (possible interrelationship of the 18
temperament scales) of the ECBQ could be influenced by cul-
tural differences. The effect of cultural influence on the mean
score was investigated using a level-oriented study, while that
on interrelationship used a structure-oriented study (Van de
Vijver & Leung, 1997; Van de Vijver & Tanzer, 2004).
Caudill and Weinstein (1969) conducted a study compar-
ing toddlers' temperaments in the United States and Japan.
This study found that Japanese mothers expect their babies to
be quiet and content, while U.S. mothers expect babies to be
vocal and active (Caudill & Weinstein, 1969). Bornstein
(1989), in a later review of the literature, also found that
infants in the United States had higher levels of motor activ-
ity than those in Japan. Therefore, the present study expected
that scores on the temperament scales on the Japanese ECBQ
representing toddlers' activity, such as Activity Level and
High-Intensity Pleasure (HIP), would be lower in Japan than
those reported in the original ECBQ (Putnam, Gartstein, &
Rothbart, 2006). In a study using a Japanese version of the
Infant Behavior Questionnaire­Revised (IBQ-R), Nakagawa
and Sukigara (2005) found that the differences in gender and
age in the scale means were almost the same as those in the
original IBQ-R. Therefore, the present study also expected to

Development of a Japanese Version of the
Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire
(ECBQ) Using Cross-Sectional and
Longitudinal Data
Masune Sukigara1, Atsuko Nakagawa1, and Rie Mizuno2
Abstract
The present article describes the development of a Japanese version of the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ).
The influence of social desirability on the Japanese ECBQ was investigated using a cross-sectional sample (N = 318). The
effects of gender and developmental changes in temperament were investigated in a longitudinal sample (N = 191). A three-
factor structure was found in the instrument, the three factors being Surgency/Extraversion, Negative Affectivity, and Effortful
Control. These factors were the same as those found in the original ECBQ. Social desirability showed less influence on the
Japanese ECBQ, indicating the instrument was free from culture-based construct bias. This longitudinal study highlighted that
Japanese toddlers have quieter, more withdrawn, and more passive temperaments, a finding that supports that of previous
research comparing temperament-scale means between Japanese and U.S. children.

find similar age and gender effects as found in the original
ECBQ.
The factor structure of temperaments in the ECBQ may be
influenced by cultural differences. In the Japanese IBQ-R,
three factors were determined: NegativeAffectivity, Surgency/
Extraversion, and Orienting/Regulation (Nakagawa &
Sukigara, 2005). These three factors were also found in the
original IBQ-R (Gartstein & Rothbart, 2003), the original
ECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006), and the original Child Behavior
Questionnaire (CBQ; Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, & Fisher,
2001). The three-factor structure in the Japanese IBQ-R
includes some different temperament scales for the Surgency/
Extraversion and Orienting/Regulation factors, but the tem-
perament scales comprising Negative Affectivity are the same
as in the original IBQ-R. For example, Gartstein and Rothbart
(2003) considered Soothability to be an Orienting/Regulation
factor, while Nakagawa and Sukigara (2005) found it to be a
Surgency/Extraversion factor. However, in the Japanese CBQ,
Kusanagi, Hoshi, and Chen (1999) found the same three-fac-
tor structure and the same scales comprising in each factor as
in the original CBQ. The Japanese ECBQ is situated between
the IBQ-R and the CBQ in terms of the age of children mea-
sured, and the present authors expected to find a similar three-
factor structure as well as some differences in the scales
comprising each factor with those found in the Japanese
Differences in the factor structures of the Japanese and
original ECBQ raise the question of why cultural differences
result in a difference in the scales comprising each factor.
Differences in the patterns of inter-correlations of the 18
ECBQ temperament scales can be expected across cultures,
but the reasons for these differences are unclear. Caprara,
Barbaranelli, Bermudez, Maslach, and Ruch (2000) com-
pared the factor structure of the Big Five questionnaire across
cultures. They suggested that the Big Five factors were
broad, general dimensions that encompass different, but
overlapping domains (Caprara et al., 2000). Therefore, it
may be that the temperament concept dimensions (factors) in
the ECBQ also have behavioral domains that overlap, and
these overlapping behaviors might differ between cultures.
These differences in overlapping behaviors may also arise
from differences in cultural beliefs and expectations for chil-
dren and/or temperament concepts. In turn, these differences
produce factor structure differences and differences in the
scales comprising each factor.
The ECBQ comprises a list of children's behaviors within
a cultural context, with the frequencies of those behaviors
rated by evaluators. It may be that when evaluators (in the
present study, caregivers) consider a particular behavior
appropriate or desirable for their culture, that behavior may
be rated as occurring more frequently. If two behaviors are
interpreted as meeting the same cultural expectations for
children, both behaviors may be rated as occurring more fre-
quently at the same time and within different contexts, and
the high correlation between them will be shown whether or
not these behaviors stem from temperament factors. This
means that the differences in overlapping behaviors can
appear as cultural differences in the factor structure and/or
the scales comprising the factors. For example, if Japanese
caregivers believe that both a low Activity Level behavior
and a high Inhibitory Control behavior are desirable and
expected for children, they will consider both behaviors to
occur more frequently in many cultural contexts, and the
resulting high correlation between them is attributed to the
same factor. However, Putnam et al. (2006) highlighted that
these behaviors stem from different temperament factors
(e.g., Activity Level from Surgency/Extraversion and
Inhibitory Control from Effortful Control).
An index of cultural differences in caregivers' beliefs and
expectations for children was necessary to provide clarity.
Social desirability differs between cultures and is considered
to be a manifestation of evaluators' cultural beliefs about
and/or expectations for their children. This makes the social
desirability of constructs, namely, 18 temperaments, a candi-
date for a cultural differences index.
To assess the impact of social desirability (an index of con-
struct bias) on the ECBQ scores, caregivers in the present
study were asked to directly evaluate their impression of their
child on 18 temperament dimensions; this rating was called
"caregiver rating of their children's temperament" (CGR). As
the ECBQ required caregivers to rate their children's behavior
in specific situations (Putnam, Ellis, & Rothbart, 2001), the
CGR was likely to show more caregiver bias. Social desirabil-
ity was therefore expected to influence the CGR rating more
strongly than the behavioral frequency ratings in the ECBQ.
However, if both the Japanese ECBQ and the CGR ratings
show the same influence by social desirability, then the tem-
perament-scale scores on the ECBQ were contaminated by
social desirability. Caregivers in the present study were asked
to complete both the CGR and the Japanese ECBQ.
Social desirability tends to additively influence rating fre-
quencies of toddler behavior for each component item of the
temperament scale. This means that social desirability
needed to be determined independently from the ECBQ and
the CGR ratings to accurately determine the causal
relationship.
It is noticed that the CGR has another purpose. In Japan,
little research on toddler temperament using the ECBQ or
other similar tests is available, meaning the results of the
present study cannot be compared with those of other
Japanese studies. Other tools were needed to investigate the
validity of the Japanese ECBQ. The CGR would be a candi-
date of the other tool. The Japanese ECBQ and the CGR
were assumed to measure the same constructs, but they were
different in the measurement method. Thus, to verify the
validity of the Japanese ECBQ, we will evaluate the correla-
tions between the scores of the Japanese ECBQ and the CGR
and will confirm whether the gender and age differences in
the CGR are like as in the Japanese ECBQ.
The present study is divided into two parts: Sutdy 1
focuses on the development of a Japanese ECBQ and seeks
Sukigara et al. 3
to verify cultural differences in the Japanese ECBQ by eval-
uating how social desirability of each temperament scale
affects these scores. Study 2 examines longitudinal shifts in
the temperament dimensions of 18- to 36-month-old infants
in the Japanese ECBQ.
It was expected that toddlers in Japan would be rated as
quieter, more content, and having lower levels of motor
activity than those reported in the original ECBQ study.
The Japanese tool was also expected to have the same
three-factor structure, and show similar age and gender dif-
ferences and developmental changes. This would indicate
that the Japanese ECBQ was compatible with the original
tool. To demonstrate that the tool was free from culture
effects, correlations between social desirability, or con-
struct bias, and the ECBQ should be lower than correlations
between social desirability and the CGR.
Method
Instrument Construction
Japanese ECBQ. The ECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006) was trans-
lated into Japanese by a professional Japanese translator and
by a graduate student who is a child care worker. These two
forward translations were then reviewed by the present
authors and synthesized into a single translation. This Japa-
nese translation was back-translated into English and the
translation quality examined by a bilingual Japanese U.S.
resident. A pilot study was conducted with 12 caregivers
who had a child aged 18 to 36 months. Participants were
asked to check the item readability in the Japanese ECBQ.
The pilot study recommended culturally appropriate modifi-
cations to questions referring to water sprinklers, nursery
rhymes, and beeping sounds.
To complete the Japanese ECBQ, caregivers were asked
to report the frequency of specific child behaviors on a
7-point Likert-type scale ranging from never to always.
Table 1 sets out the number of items on each scale.
CGR. A short, clear definition of the 18 temperament dimen-
sions was prepared as an item in Japanese (see the appendix).
Caregivers were asked to rate how applicable a given tem-
perament dimension was to their child on a 6-point Likert-
type scale ranging from least to most. It was emphasized that
these ratings were to be according to global judgments and/
or impressions, and not the frequency of their children's
behaviors.
Social desirability.To observe the social desirability of the
temperament dimensions independently from the ECBQ
scores, a different adult sample was needed. This sample
rated the social desirability of definitions (constructs) of the
18 temperaments on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from
undesirable to desirable. The 18 items were the same as on
the CGR. Participants were instructed on the definition of
social desirability before providing ratings, and it was

emphasized that they should rate whether the temperament
dimension is popularly acceptable and/or desirable in Japan
and not rate the desirability of the temperaments for their
own children.
Participants and Sampling Methods
Sample 1. Caregivers who attended a medical check-up for
an 18-month-old child at public health centers in Nagoya and
Konan in Aichi Prefecture, and Fukui in Fukui Prefecture
were invited to participate in the study. This gave a study
sample of 318 toddlers (49% female). The average age of
caregivers was 33.69 years (standard deviation [SD] = 4.18
years); they were primarily female, except for one male and
three unknown, and 97% were mothers. The exclusion crite-
ria were a birth weight of less than 2,500 g or more than
4,000 g; a gestation period of less than 38 weeks or more
than 43 weeks; a birth defect; and those who attended a nurs-
ery school (caregivers needed to observe their children's
behavior all day to answer the ECBQ).
The majority of the data were collected in metropolitan
Nagoya (75%), 14% in Konan, 8% in the provincial town of
Fukui, and a further 2% in other locations. The Japanese
ECBQ and the CGR were distributed to caregivers, provid-
ing data for a first time-point.
To allow for a cross-sectional analysis, toddlers were
divided in three groups according to age as in Putnam et al.
(2006). A young group (Y) aged 18 to 23 months (N = 191,
98 female and 93 male), a middle group (M) aged 24 to 29
months (N = 69, 36 female and 33 male), and an older group
(O) aged 30 to 36 months (N = 58, 23 female and 35 male).
Because both Nagoya and Konan did not have any 0% val-
ues, we constructed an Age (3) × Location (Nagoya and
Konan) frequency table and tested this using a chi-square
test. We found no significant difference in the age propor-
tion of participants from urban and rural settings (2 = 2.29,
df = 3, n.s.).
Six months later, the Japanese ECBQ was administered
for a second time to 194 participants. At the first time-point,
48 of the 318 participants who belonged to the older age
group were out of the ECBQ's coverage age by the second
time-point. So, at second time, those 48 were not requested
to respond to the Japanese ECBQ. Because 76 did not return
the questionnaire, 194 participants were analyzed. Responses
could be matched to first-time participants through the birth-
days of child and mother, child's gender, and residential area
(Nagoya: 76%, Konan: 10%, Fukui: 11%, Other: 1%). This
provided data for a second time-point, and Cronbach's alphas
were calculated for the 194 data sets.
Twelve months later, 128 participants with children aged
24 to 29 months were administered the ECBQ by mail. This
provided data for a third time-point. A total of 127 partici-
pants (Nagoya: 74%, Konan: 12%, Fukui: 14%) returned
the ECBQ. Cronbach's alphas were conducted for the 127
data sets.
Sample 2. Adults (N = 368; 301 female, 23 male, and 44 of
unknown gender) ages ranging 22 to 55 years (M = 34.7
years, SD = 4.37 years, and median = 35 years) were recruited
from kindergartens and nursery schools in Nagoya (25%),
Konan (62%), and Kokubunji (13%). These groups of par-
ticipants were asked to rate the social desirability of con-
structs of the 18 temperament scales on a 6-point Likert-type
scale.
Results
The results of the present study are presented in two parts.
First, the factor structures of the Japanese ECBQ, CGR, and
social desirability are reported, along with the relationships
between these indices, and the mean scale scores of the
cross-sectional data (318 participants). Second, the findings
of the investigation of the longitudinal shift in temperament
scales (127 participants) are reported.
Study 1: Cross-Sectional Data
Distributions, means, and SDs. The means and SDs for each
age by gender on each temperament scale are set out in Table
1. In Sample 1 (N = 318), the normality of distribution was
examined with a Shapiro-Wilk test. Activity Level, Atten-
tional Focusing, Attentional Shifting, Cuddliness, Frustra-
tion (FR), HIP, Inhibitory Control, and Perceptual Sensitivity
were normally distributed, while the remaining 10 scales
were not. However, distributions for all scales had one peak
and were nearly symmetrical at the peak.
Internal consistency. Alpha coefficients of temperament scales
for the first time-point are shown in Table 2. Of the 18 alphas,
14 were more than .70, indicating substantial internal consis-
tency. Four alphas were below .70: Attentional Shifting ( =
.66), Discomfort ( = .65), Impulsivity ( = .63), and Motor
Activation ( = .69). These alphas were similar to those in
Putnam et al. (2006), and changes of alpha coefficient by age
group also followed the same trends. Therefore, the Japanese
ECBQ was show to have internal consistency corresponding
to that of the original ECBQ.
Factor structure (Japanese ECBQ).A principal component
analysis of the 18 temperament scales was conducted with-
out rotation. The eigenvalues were 3.634, 2.847, 2.438, and
1.114, in descending order; the fourth eigenvalue was less
than half of the third, and these three components accounted
for 49.6% of the total variance. A factor analysis with pro-
crustes rotation was conducted to confirm whether the pat-
tern matrix replicated the original ECBQ. The factor patterns
obtained had good consistency with the target pattern, using
both a factor congruent coefficient and a variable congruent
coefficient (Table 3). These congruent coefficients are the
correlation coefficients between the factor loadings in the
target pattern and those in the pattern obtained for each factor
Sukigara et al. 5
and on each variable. This indicates sufficient comparability
between the two-factor patterns of more than .90 (McCrae,
Zonderman, Costa, Bond, & Paunonen, 1996). However, less
compatible between the Japanese and the original ECBQ for
Perceptual Sensitivity, with a variable congruent coefficient
of .775, was found. This means that almost the same factor
structure (with a first factor of Negative Affectivity, a second
of Effortful Control, and a third of Surgency/Extraversion)
was found in both versions.
CGR.Principal component and factor analyses were con-
ducted for the CGR as for the ECBQ. The eigenvalues were
2.957, 2.521, 2.107, and 1.088, in descending order; the
fourth eigenvalue was less than half of the third, and these
three components accounted for 42.1% of the total variance.
Therefore, the three-factor solution was also adopted for the
CGR.
A factor analysis with procrustes rotation was conducted
to confirm whether the pattern matrix of the CGR was same
as the original ECBQ we conducted. The factor congruent
coefficients were slightly less than .90, indicating factor pat-
terns obtained had almost as good consistency with the target
pattern (Table 3). Some incongruent variables were found on
the Surgency/Extraversion factor (Positive Anticipation
-.393, Impulsivity .782, Sociability .857, and Activity Level
.890) and on the Effortful Control factor (Attentional Shifting
.818, and Low-Intensity Pleasure .649), while the tempera-
ment scales of the Negative Affectivity were congruent with
the original. As the factor structure of the Japanese ECBQ
replicated the original ECBQ, the temperament scales of two
factors for the CGR were affected by something other than
the temperaments measured with the ECBQ. These results
align with those of Nakagawa and Sukigara (2005), where
the Japanese IBQ-R did not replicate the temperament scales
of the original Surgency and the Effortful Control factors,
but the Negative Affectivity temperament scales were
congruent.
Social desirability.An exploratory factor analysis with vari-
max rotation was conducted on social desirability in Sample
2 (N = 368). A two-factor solution was found (Table 4), with
 values of 2.685 (14.9%) and 2.206 (12.2%). The tempera-
ment scales with high first-factor loading had high social
desirability, but those with high second-factor loading had
low social desirability (Tables 4 and 5). Therefore, the mea-
surement of social desirability measured the social desirabil-
ity of temperament constructs, but not temperament
constructs per se.
Social desirability, ECBQ, and CGR.The means and SDs for
social desirability on each temperament scale are shown in
Table 5. The effects of social desirability were considered to
add to the mean scores of each scale in the ECBQ and the
CGR by constant amount, meaning the correlation coeffi-
cients between the social desirability and the ECBQ, and
between the social desirability and the CGR were an index of
the amount of the social desirability effect. Correlation coef-
ficients for the mean scale scores of the social desirability,

Note. ECBQ = Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire; CGR = caregiver rating of their children's temperament.
the ECBQ, and the CGR were calculated over the 18 tem-
perament scales (Figure 1). The correlation between social
desirability and the ECBQ was r = .646 (N = 18, p < .01); for
social desirability and the CGR, r = .803 (N = 18, p < .01);
and for the ECBQ and the CGR, r = .725 (N = 18, p < .01).
However, Fisher's z test showed that the correlation coeffi-
cient between social desirability and the CGR was not statis-
tically higher than the correlation between social desirability
and the ECBQ (z = .927, n.s.).
Figure 1 presents a scatter diagram of the ECBQ and the
CGR temperament dimensions in terms of social desirability.
For the relationship of the ECBQ to social desirability, all
temperament dimensions, excluding Impulsivity (I) and HIP,
lined up linearly (r2 = .417) in the relationship of the CGR to
social desirability; all but FR lined up linearly (r2 = .645).
Social desirability accounted for a greater proportion of vari-
ance in the CGR than in the ECBQ, suggesting that the CGR
was influenced more by social desirability than the ECBQ.
To evaluate the contribution of social desirability, the par-
tial correlation between the CGR and social desirability
excluding the effect of the ECBQ (r = .636, N = 18, p < .01),
and the partial correlation between the ECBQ and social
desirability excluding the effect of the CGR (r = .155,
Sukigara et al. 7
N = 18, n.s.) were calculated. This indicates that although
caregivers rate global impression of toddler temperament
according to social desirability, their reports of the frequency
of specific child behaviors were relatively independent of
social desirability.
Gender and age effects in Japanese ECBQ.Gender and age
effects were assessed using a 2 × 3 (Gender × Age Group)
ANOVA. The effects of age were significant for Discomfort,
Perceptual Sensitivity, Impulsivity, Sociability, Positive
Anticipation, Inhibitory Control, Attentional Shifting, Cud-
dliness, and Attentional Focusing (Table 1). A contrast analy-
sis indicated that Impulsivity linearly declined with age at
the .05 significance level, and Attentional Shifting linearly
increased with age at the .01 significance level. Other signifi-
cant scales also increased linearly with age at a 1% level.
These trends were similar to those found in Putnam et al.
(2006).
The effects of gender were significant for FR, Activity
Level, HIP, Inhibitory Control, Low-Intensity Pleasure, and
Cuddliness: Fs(1, 312) = 5.81, 4.95, 6.86, 12.33, 5.51, and
4.35; 2s = .018, .016, .022, .038, .017, and .014 (Table 1).
Males had significantly a higher mean score on FR and
Activity Level than females (p < .05). Caregivers rated males
significantly higher than females for HIP, while for Inhibitory
Control, females were rated significantly higher than males
(p < .01). Females also had higher mean scores on Cuddliness
and Low-Intensity Pleasure than males (p < .05).

The gender effect significantly interacted with age on
Fear and Attention Shifting, Fs(2, 312) = 3.64 and 3.32, ps <
.05 (2s = .023 and .021).Apost hoc test using the Bonferroni
method found that male Fear scores were significantly higher
than female scores at age 24 to 30 months (p < .01). For
Attention Shifting, the same test clarified that female scores
were significantly higher at 30 to 36 months (p < .01),
although this was not significant at 24 to 30 months. This
suggests that the female Attention Shifting scores increased
as they grew older, while male scores remained the same
regardless of age.
CGR.Table 5 shows the mean score on each temperament
scale. Age and gender effects were assessed using a 2 × 3
(Gender × Age Group) ANOVA. Age was found to have a
significant effect on Sociability, Positive Anticipation, and
Attention Focusing, Fs(2, 312) = 4.08, 3.52, 6.86, ps < .05,
.05, .001 (2s = .025, .022, .043). A contrast analysis indi-
cated that caregivers' ratings on these scales significantly
increased linearly with age (at 1%, 5%, and 1% significance
levels). For Impulsivity and HIP, however, the rates signifi-
cantly decreased with age, Fs(2, 312) = 3.54, 3.49, ps < .05
(2s = .023, .022; the linear trends on the contrast analysis
were significant at 1% and 5%). Age also had a significant
effect on Fear, F(2, 312) = 4.14, p < .05 (2s = .026), and a
contrast analysis showed marginal significance on the qua-
dratic trend (p = .055) that was highest for the M group.
Gender effects were found for Sadness, Impulsivity,
Activity Level, and Inhibitory Control, Fs(1, 312) = 4.65,
4.49, 8.32, 5.70, ps < .05, .05, .005, .05 (2s = .015, .014,
.023, .018). Caregivers rated females higher than males for
Inhibitory Control, whereas for the other three scales
(Activity Level, Impulsivity, and Sadness), males scored
higher than females. No interaction of age with gender was
found.
Age-related effects in the CGR differed from those in the
Japanese ECBQ on dimensions of Attention Shifting, Fear,
HIP, Low-Intensity Pleasure, Perceptual Sensitivity, and
Soothability. The age-related changes in the mean rates were
the same in both the ECBQ and CGR. However, only the
Activity Level temperament had the same main effect in both
the ECBQ and CGR.
Relationships between the Japanese ECBQ and the CGR.Cor-
relation coefficients between the scale score of the ECBQ
and CGR ranged from .20 (Impulsivity) to .65 (Attentional
Focusing; Table 5).All correlations were significantly greater
than zero at p < .001, but the correlation coefficients were at
a medium level. The CGR was assumed to measure the same
constructs (temperaments) as the ECBQ with a different
measuring method, meaning the correlations on each scale
between the CGR and the ECBQ would be slightly lower
than each scale's reliability coefficient. From the alpha coef-
ficients of temperament scales in Table 2 and the correlation
coefficients in Table 5, it appears that the higher the alpha,
the higher the correlation. The highest alpha and correlation
were .89 and .65 (Attentional Focusing), and the lowest
alpha and correlation were .63 and .20 (Impulsivity). As all
correlations were low, the CGR may have been contaminated
by something other than the toddlers' temperaments and the
effect of differences in methods (e.g., caregivers' expecta-
tions of their child and/or social desirability).
Study 2: Longitudinal Shifts
Attrition effects. At the first time-point, 48 of the 318 partici-
pants who belonged to the older age group were out of the
ECBQ's coverage age by the second time-point. This means
these participants were not asked to respond to the Japanese
ECBQ a second time. Of the remaining participants, 204
returned the questionnaire, but only 194 were analyzed. This
gave an attrition size of 76 from the first to the second time-
points. At the third time-point 12 months later, only 128 par-
ticipants were requested to answer the Japanese ECBQ. A
total of 127 participants returned the questionnaire, giving an
attrition size from the second to the third time-points of one.
To investigate the attrition effect of the 76 dropout partici-
pants from the first to the second time-points (an attrition
rate of 24.2%; male: 23.2%, female: 31.9%), a comparison
of the temperament-scale means of the attrition sample and
the sample at the second time-point was conducted using t
tests. No significant differences in any scales between the
two samples were found. The samples at the first, second,
and third time-points and the attrition group had the same
composition of recruitment area, indicating attrition did not
bias the results.
Internal consistency and inter-time correlations (test­retest cor-
relations).The alpha coefficients of the temperament scales
for the second and third time-points, are shown in Table 6.
These alphas were almost the same as from the first time-
point indicating that the Japanese ECBQ had sufficient inter-
nal consistency when it was repeatedly administered.
To investigate the inter-time correlation for each tempera-
ment scale, a correlation coefficient between time-points was
calculated (Table 6). Of the 18 correlations between the
young (Y) and middle (M) age groups (i.e., between the first
and second time-points), Positive Anticipation had the low-
est correlation (r = .27) as Putnam et al. (2006). This dimen-
sion was also lowest between the M and older (O) age groups
(i.e., between the second and third time-points; r = .51) and
between the first and third time-points (r = .30). The highest
correlation was for Perceptual Sensitivity, from the Y to M
groups (r = .77) and from the Y to the O groups (r = .67). The
correlation for Motor Activation was the highest between the
M and O groups (r = .79). Table 6 also shows the average
correlation of the 18 temperament dimensions obtained by
calculating the mean of the Fisher z transformation of rs.
This means r represents overall inter-time consistency among
the 18 temperament dimensions.
Sukigara et al. 9
Some items for which consistency is lowest (e.g., Positive
Anticipation) describe situations less relevant for 18-month-
old toddlers but more relevant for older toddlers: for exam-
ple, "When hearing about a future family outing (such as a
trip to the playground)." This may explain the lower correla-
tions across time-points.
The inter-time correlation can be interpreted as test­retest
reliability. However, the correlations were influenced by
both developmental changes and individual differences,
meaning developmental changes may have attenuated the
intrinsic test­retest reliability. No explanation has been
offered for the correlation across time-points for the Y and M
groups, as methods to differentiate the two effects are not
available at present.
Longitudinal shifts of temperament dimension and gender
effect. Longitudinal shifts and gender effects were assessed
using a 2 × 3 (Gender × Time) ANOVA. Table 7 shows the
longitudinal shifts for each gender. The main effects of time
(age) were significant on all but three temperament dimen-
sions: Low-Intensity Pleasure, Motor Activation, and Shy-
ness (Table 7). Soothability decreased linearly with time
(age), Activity Level had the highest mean score at the sec-
ond time-point, and the other temperament dimensions
increased linearly with time (age).
The effects of gender were significant for Activity Level,
HIP, Inhibitory Control, and Low-Intensity Pleasure (Table 7).
For Activity Level and HIP, males had higher mean scores
than females, while females had higher mean scores than
males for Inhibitory Control and Low-Intensity Pleasure.
The gender effect significantly interacted with age only
on Shyness, F(2, 250) = 4.00, p < .05. Shyness scores for
females increased as the toddlers grew older, whereas the
male scores increased from the first to the second time-points
and decreased until the third time-point.
Discussion
The present study concluded that the Japanese ECBQ was not
contaminated by social desirability and is a well-developed,
culture-free tool. The findings showed that the 18 scales were
internally consistent and consistent across time. The factor
structure of the instrument was the same as that of the original
ECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006) and was similar to that of fine-
grained measures of temperament dimension currently in use
with younger (IBQ-R) and older children (CBQ). The age and
gender differences and developmental changes that emerged
in the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were also con-
sistent with the original ECBQ.
Assuming that social desirability is a manifestation of the
raters' cultural beliefs and/or expectations (construct bias)
for their toddlers, the correlations between the ECBQ, the
CGR, and social desirability were evaluated (Figure 1). The
partial correlations suggested that caregivers' global

impression ratings of temperament were contaminated by
social desirability, but their reports on the frequency of spe-
cific child behaviors were affected by few social desirability.
As the CGR factor structure differed from the original
ECBQ, and the factor structure of the Japanese ECBQ was
the same as the original, social desirability was suggested to
produce differences in the factor structure.
Both the CGR and the Japanese ECBQ have the same
three-factor structure, but the scales comprising each factor
differ from the original ECBQ. The factor patterns of the
Surgency/Extraversion factor (Positive Anticipation,
Impulsivity, Sociability, and Activity Level) and that of the
Effortful Control factor (Attentional Shifting and Low-
Intensity Pleasure) were incongruent with the factor pattern
of the original ECBQ. The results of the Japanese IBQ-R
were similar to those found in the CGR in the present study
particularly as the children's behavioral frequency ratings in
the IBQ-R were also affected by social desirability. This sug-
gests that social desirability has more influence on both
global impressions rated by the CGR and infants' behaviors
rated by the IBQ-R, but less influence on the toddlers rated
by the ECBQ. It may be inferred that the influence of social
desirability on the behavior ratings decreases as the children
grow older (i.e., from infant to toddler) but that the influence
on global impression ratings are longer lasting.
However, the present results contradict the common belief
that effects of culture through rearing styles and education
increase as children grow older. It may be that as infants or
neonates are relatively immobile, and some behaviors do not
occur until the child is older, raters'beliefs or expectation for
children may be more strongly projected and contaminate
the behavioral frequency ratings. This would be less likely to
occur as children grew older, as older children are more
mobile and their behavior is often more apparent to raters
(caregivers) and therefore more likely to be rated accurately.
This means that construct bias may be more likely to influ-
ence rating frequency of infant behavior than that of older
children. This may explain why the effect of social desirabil-
ity on the CGR continued after the effect of social desirabil-
ity on the ECBQ ceased. However, this suggestion should be
investigated in more detail in future.
Cultural differences were also found in scale score levels.
First, the mean scale scores for the Negative Affectivity fac-
tor (Discomfort, Fear, Sadness, and Shyness) were higher in
the Japanese ECBQ and Soothability scores were lower than
in the original ECBQ (Putnam et al., 2006). Second, for HIP
and Sociability (Surgency/Extraversion factor), Japanese
toddlers had significantly lower mean scores. This aligns
with previous findings that toddlers in Japan are quieter,
more content, and have a lower level of motor activity than
Sukigara et al. 11
those in the United States (Bornstein, 1989; Caudill &
Weinstein, 1969).
These well-known cultural differences were replicated in
the present study and suggest that the Japanese ECBQ paral-
lels many former Japanese tests of temperament and/or per-
sonality (Caudill & Weinstein, 1969; Nakagawa & Sukigara,
2005; Shoji, Soeda, Tsunetsugu, & Maekawa, 1995;
Sugawara, Aoki, Kitamura, & Shima, 1988).
It is remarkable that the present study replicated the cul-
tural differences in the temperament scores found by Caudill
and Weinstein (1969), particularly as that study is 45 years
old. The age difference between their sample (3- to 4-month-
old U.S. and Japanese infants) and the present study sample
(18-36 months) means that finding the same cultural differ-
ences is surprising. This indicates that children's tempera-
ments and/or caregivers' expectations for their children do
not change so easily over a 45-year period.
