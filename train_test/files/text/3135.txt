Abstract
Background: A previous study based on NHANES 2001­2002 observed that increased levels of urinary perchlorate were associated
with increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone among all women, and with decreased levels of thyroxine among women with low
urinary iodine. No associations were observed for men.
Methods: Using the same NHANES 2001­2002 data, associations of urinary perchlorate with indirect biomarkers of thyroid hormone
disruption were investigated. Decreased levels of hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) have been
observed among subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism. To investigate the suitability of these indicators for use in observational

studies, subjects were divided into six groups: boys, age 6­19; men, age 20­85; girls, age 6­14; non-pregnant women, age 15­49;
women, age 50­85; and pregnant women. Use of perchlorate quintiles (Q1-Q5) and continuous log-transformed perchlorate in the
regression models allowed investigation of both non-linear and linear associations. Adjustments were made for age, urinary creatinine,
race/ethnicity, body mass index, cotinine, poverty index, hours of fasting, thiocyanate, nitrate, daily kcal intake, C-reactive protein.
Adjustment for alcohol consumption depended on availability. Adjustment for prescription drugs (beta-blockers, sex hormones, antihy-
perlipidemic and antidiabetic drugs) was made if it changed the perchlorate estimate by $10%.
Results: Statistically significant decreases were observed for HGB and HCT among boys, men, women age 15­49, and pregnant
women, and for HDL among men.
Conclusions:Although the mean response biomarkers were within normal range, their association with urinary perchlorate is of interest.
HGB and HCT among pregnant women showed a stronger association with urinary perchlorate than non-pregnant women age 15­49.
Statistically significant associations were observed for individual perchlorate quintiles. Assumption of linearity of log-transformed per-
chlorate may result in underestimation of some associations.

Background
Presence of perchlorate (ClO
4
-) in the environment
is widespread due to both natural processes and
human activities.1 Exposure of humans, which occurs
primarily through ingestion of contaminated water
and food, is a current national concern, because
perchlorate is a known thyroid toxicant. It prevents
iodide from entering the thyroid, which may lead to
diminished production of thyroid hormones. Several
studies have discussed the risks of environmental
exposures to perchlorate, especially the potential
adverse effects on thyroid hormone function.1­4
Urinary perchlorate levels can be used as non-
invasive surrogate biological markers of exposure,
because perchlorate is not metabolized in the human
body.1 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and
thyroxine (T4) are measured as direct biological
markers of effect on thyroid economy, as for example
in newborn screening and adult testing for hypo- and
hyperthyroidism. A recent study based on the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
2001­2002,assessedassociationsofurinaryperchlorate
withTSH andT4.2 Results showed that increased levels
of urinary perchlorate were associated with increased
levels of TSH for all women, and decreased levels of
T4 for women with low urinary iodine (,100 µg/L).
No association was observed for men. Another study
among women in the same NHANES 2001­2002 data
observed that smoking and thiocyanate interact with
perchlorate in diminishing thyroid function.3 These
studies brought attention to the gender-specific effect
of perchlorate on the thyroid.5
Thyroid hormones are a requisite for proper

neurodevelopment and physiological function through-
out life. Levels of thyroid hormones (THs) serve as
direct indicators of thyroid hormone 
dysfunction.
Examples are increased levels of TSH associated with
normal or decreased levels of T4, or decreased lev-
els of T4 without a change of TSH, which may occur
when T4 is displaced from its binding protein by a

xenobiotic. Another type of disruption occurs when
endocrine disrupting chemicals displace THs from
their receptors, which can change the 
structure and
the signaling of the TH receptor 
without 
necessarily
changing the TH levels.5­8 Signaling pathways of dif-
ferent nuclear receptors, including TH 
receptors, can
cross-talk with each other, and disrupt theTH transcrip-
tion process with unknown biological consequences.6,7
Chemicals that are known to cause adverse changes in
circulating TH levels have been classified as thyroid
toxicants.6 In contrast, endocrine disrupting chemi-
cals that cause perturbation of TH action through their
receptors, such as signaling, without causing a change
in TH levels, are not included in the definition of thy-
roid toxicants.6 Given that environmental pollutants
can affect THs in different ways, it may be useful to
investigate if in addition to the routinely used "direct"
indicators, "
indirect" biomarkers of TH dysfunction
can be identified, in order to expand the available
number of biomarkers measuring the level of TH dys-
function in observational human studies. Therefore, to
expand observations of adverse effects associated with
TH, both changes in TH levels and TH action may
have to be considered. The problem is how to deter-
mine perturbation of TH action. Thyroid hormones
play an important role in many functions of the body,
such as lipid metabolism, enzyme activity, neurologic,
endothelial, and cardiac functions.9,10 Interference of
TH action by environmental pollutants may adversely
affect one or more of these systems, which may be indi-
cated by effect biomarkers, such as decreased 
levels
of HDL, HGB or HCT ("indirect" markers of thyroid

dysfunction). High density lipoprotein (HDL), a major
factor in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) mech-
anism, removes excess cholesterol from peripheral tis-
sues to the liver for excretion.11­15 A decrease of HDL
may indicate a perturbation of the RCT mechanism,
the key enzymes of which are under control of TH.16,17
The erythrocyte-related indices haemoglobin (HGB)
and hematocrit (HCT) may be potential indicators of
TH changes. Among subjects with overt or subclini-
cal hypothyroidism, decreased HGB and HCT have
been observed, which are thought to be associated with
decreased TH-controlled hematopoiesis.18­20
Because the traditionally used direct biomarkers
of thyroid status (TSH and T4) were not associated
with perchlorate among men,2 the purpose of this
study is to investigate if HDL, HGB, and HCT are
suitable indirect indicators of TH dysfunction among
both men and women.
Methods
Data source and exclusion criteria
The data source for this study was NHANES
2001­2002, one of several publicly available

survey datasets collected by the Centers for Disease
Perchlorate and indirect indicators of thyroid dysfunction in NHANES 2001-2002.
Biomarker Insights 2011:6 137
Control (CDC).21 The purpose of these surveys is
to obtain information on the nutritional and health
status of the US general population. Because these
datasets do not contain identifiable private informa-
tion, studies based on these data are exempt from IRB
approval. The total number of subjects in the sub-
population selected for perchlorate analysis of spot
urine samples was 2942 with an age range of 6­85,
consisting of 47% males (n = 1374) and 53% females
(n = 1568). The current study excluded subjects based
on the following criteria: missing perchlorate values;
previous diagnosis of diseases in which TH dysfunc-
tion might have played a role, such as congestive
heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,
acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, diabetes
mellitus, thyroid problems and use of prescribed thy-
roid hormones. Values judged to be outliers, such as
TSH . 200 IU/L, or CRP . 10 mg/dL, were also
excluded.
Variables and statistical analyses
The analyses were applied to six groups of subjects:
males, ages 6­19 and ages 20­85; girls, ages 6­14;
women of reproductive age, but non-pregnant, ages
15­49; women, ages 50­85; and pregnant women as
determined by test. The reason for categorizing men
and women by different age groups is the following.
Alcohol consumption, which is an important vari-
able, was available only for subjects ages 20 and over.
Therefore men were categorized by age groups ,20
and $20, so that alcohol could be adjusted for in those
at age 20 years and older. However, women were cat-
egorized by reproductive status, which was thought
to be more meaningful with regard to potential asso-
ciations with perchlorate.
Regression analysis was used to assess the associ-
ation of levels of urinary perchlorate as the exposure
surrogate with the biological measures HDL, HGB,
and HCT. HDL was natural-log transformed in order
to reduce skewness. HGB and HCT were approxi-
mately normally distributed. The exposure variable
of interest, urinary perchlorate, was used in several
ways: (1) as an indicator variable representing indi-
vidual quintiles (Q1 through Q5), with Q1 as the ref-
erent (,1.9, 1.9­3.1, 3.2­4.8, 4.9­7.3, $7.4 µg/L);
(2) grouping of contiguous perchlorate quintiles, eg,
combined Q2 and Q3 (Q2-3), combined Q4 and Q5
(Q4-5), and combined Q3, Q4, and Q5 (Q3-5) with
Q1 as the referent; and (3) continuous perchlorate
(natural log transformed). Use of these different per-
chlorate measures allows identification of both non-
linear and linear associations.
Most of the explanatory variables selected for this
study are the same as those used by Blount et al.2 The
following variables were included in all regression
analyses: age (years, continuous), urinary creatinine
(mg/dL, continuous, log transformed); race/
ethnicity:
non-Hispanic White (referent), 
Hispanic 
American,
non-Hispanic Black, other race/ethnicity; body
mass index (BMI, continuous, log-transformed),
cotinine: low, (,0.015 ng/mL referent), medium
(0.015­10 ng/mL), and high (.10 ng/mL), based on
Steinmaus and Miller;3 poverty index, the ratio of
family income to poverty threshold (dichotomous, ,1
versus $1); hours of fasting (log-
transformed, con-
tinuous), thiocyanate (mg/L, continuous, log-trans-
formed); nitrate (mg/L, continuous, log-transformed);
dailykcalintake(continuous,log-transformed),which
is closely related to dietary iron intake;22 C-reactive
protein (CRP, mg/dL, continuous, log-transformed).
Thiocyanate (mg/L) and nitrate (mg/L) were included
because, like perchlorate, they may impair thyroid
function by inhibiting iodide uptake by the thyroid.
Additionaladjustmentsweremadeforsomegroups.
Information on alcohol consumption (none, referent;
low, 1­10 drinks per week; high, 11 or more drinks
per week) was available only for subjects ages 20 and
over, and was included in the regressions for men,
age 20 and over, women age 50 and over, and women
age 15­49 with alcohol use for the 15­19 year old set
to "none". Two separate indicator variables were cre-
ated for the regression analyses, indicating low alco-
hol use (1 = yes, 0 = otherwise) and high alcohol use
(1 = yes, 0 = otherwise). 
Adjustments were made for
use of the following prescription drugs: beta blockers,
sex hormones (contraceptives, androgens, estrogens,
progestins), antihyperlipidemic agents; antidiabetic
agents) for men age 20 and over, women age 15­49,
and women age 50 and over. 
Indicator variables
were created for each of the prescriptions with val-
ues 1 = yes (taking this prescription) or 0 (not taking
this prescription). Non-pregnant women age 15­49
were also adjusted for having been pregnant in the
past year (1 = yes, 0 = no) and for having a men-
strual period (1 = yes, 0 = no) at time of sampling.

Regression analyses for girls age 6­14 were adjusted
Schreinemachers
138 Biomarker Insights 2011:6
for 
menarchal status by an indicator variable with

values 1 (= first period had occurred before interview)
or 0 (= 
otherwise). Because no information was avail-
able for girls age 6­11, they were assumed to be pre-
menarche.Among the 12­14 year old girls, 105 out of
167 (63%) were post-menarche. No 
additional adjust-
ments were included for pregnant women because of
their low sample size.
Laboratory methods have been described in detail
previously.2,21 Whole blood and spot urine samples
were collected and stored cold or frozen. HDL was
measured using a heparin-manganese precipitation
method. HGB and HCT were obtained from a com-
plete blood count on a Beckman Coulter counter.
Urinary perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate were
analytically measured by ion chromatography tan-
dem mass spectrometry.
Regression analyses were performed using the
SAS procedure PROC SURVEYREG.23 This pro-
cedure applies linear regression to a non-randomly
selected study population by accounting for corre-
lations between sampling clusters and by assigning
weights to subjects, so that outcomes are representa-
tive of the US general population. The Wilcoxon rank
sum test was used for the comparison of the depen-
dent variables between subject groups. The Spear-
man correlation test was used to measure correlations
between variables.
The parameter estimates  and 95% confidence
interval (CI) represent the change of the dependent
variable associated with a perchlorate quintile or
combined quintiles for non-linear associations, or a
unit of continuous log-transformed perchlorate, indi-
cating a linear association, with adjustment for other
characteristics.
Results
The total number of excluded subjects was 848 due
to: missing perchlorate values (n = 122); thyroid
associated diseases (n = 489); use of prescribed thy-
roid hormones (n = 321); and TSH and CRP outli-
ers (n = 5). The remaining number of subjects was
2094 consisting of 1010 (48%) men and 1084 (52%)
women. Characteristics of the resulting study popula-
tion are presented in Table 1. Distribution character-
istics of urinary perchlorate for the six study groups
are presented in Table 2. The highest perchlorate con-
centrations were observed for the younger male and
female subjects, followed by the pregnant women.
Table 3 presents unadjusted means and standard
errors for the three outcome variables (HGB, HCT,
and HDL) by quintiles of urinary perchlorate for
each of the six study groups. Although the means by
perchlorate quintile were within normal range, both
linear and non-linear associations with urinary per-
chlorate were observed. An example of a possible
non-linear relationship was the decrease observed for
HDL, which dropped at the 2nd and 3rd perchlorate
quintile for men, age 20­85 and 6­19, respectively,
and continued to stay at a lower level. Other variables
showed a more direct linear decrease with increasing
perchlorate concentration, eg, HGB and HCT among
pregnant women.
Regression-based associations between urinary
perchlorate and the three outcome variables of inter-
est are presented in Table 4A and B.
Boys, age 6­19 (Table 4A)
The average level of association with HGB and
HCT showed a significant decrease with coefficients
of -0.23 (-0.41, -0.04) and -0.57 (-1.10, -0.03),
respectively. No significant association was observed
with HDL.
Men, age 20­85 (Table 4A)
Associations with HGB and HCT were not clearly

linear, although the highest values were observed in
Q5. The coefficients associated with log-transformed
perchlorate for HGB and HCT were -0.18
(-0.33, -0.02) and -0.47 -0.92, -0.01), respectively.
The regression model for log-transformed HDL
showed a significant decrease based on the coefficient
of -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01) associated with Q2-3. This
agreed with the "drop off" observed for the unad-
justed data (Table 3). At higher concentrations of uri-
nary perchlorate HDL started to increase.
Girls, age 6­14 (Table 4A)
No significant associations with perchlorate were
observed for HGB, HCT, or HDL.
Women, age 15­49, non-pregnant
(Table 4B)
Amongthe491womenages15­49(reproductiveage),
213 (43%) were under age 20. Information on alco-
hol consumption was not available for this age group.

Biomarker Insights 2011:6 139
To check if the value "no alcohol use" could be
assigned to these women, the following analysis was
done. Among the women age 20­49, 69% did not use
alcohol, 27% were low alcohol users, and 4% were
high users in the last 12 months. Regression models
for women age 20­49 showed that the estimated effect
of alcohol consumption on the dependent variables of
interest in this study was no more than 1%. This, and
the fact that alcohol consumption is either none or low
for most women, are reasons to believe setting alco-
hol consumption for 15­19 year old women to zero
is reasonable. The strongest decrease for HGB and
HCT was observed in Q3, followed by an increase.
The coefficients for HGB and HCT in Q3 were -0.67
(-1.36, 0.02) and -2.02 (-3.74, -0.30), respectively.
No associations were observed for HDL.
Women, age 50­85 (Table 4B)
No associations were observed for HGB, HCT,
or HDL.
Pregnant women, age 16­38 (Table 4B)
In spite of the low number of observations, statistically
significant decreases were observed for HGB

and HCT. Coefficients for combined Q3-5 were -0.59
(-1.01, -0.17), and -1.73 (-2.89, -0.58), for HGB
and HCT respectively. In contrast to the non-pregnant
womenofreproductiveage,estimatesfortheindividual
perchlorate quintiles among pregnant women showed
that the association between perchlorate and HGB,
HCTwas monotonic, resulting in a significant estimate
for the overall perchlorate association. This was also
observed in the non-adjusted data (Table 3). No
significant associations were observed for HDL.
Association between direct and indirect
indicators
To determine if direct indicators (TSH and T4) and
indirect indicators (HDL, HGB, and HCT) of TH
disruption were associated, partial age-adjusted

Spearman correlations were performed for the com-
bined groups of men and the combined groups of
women, ages 12­85 (Table 5). Thyroid hormone val-
ues were not available for those under age 12. The fol-
lowing significant correlations were observed among
men: TSH and HDL (r = -0.070, P = 0.05); T4 and
HGB (r = 0.093, P = 0.01); T4 and HCT (r = 0.089,
P = 0.01). Among women,T4 and HDL were corre-
lated (r = 0.066, P = 0.05). No significant correla-
tions were observed among subjects with urinary
iodine , 100 µg/L.

Perchlorate and indirect indicators of thyroid dysfunction in NHANES 2001-2002.
Biomarker Insights 2011:6 141
Discussion
In addition to changes of TSH and T4 levels as direct
indicators of TH disruption in association with per-
chlorate exposure, results from this study support
the hypothesis that HDL, HGB and HCT levels may
serve as indirect indicators. Although the means of
these indirect effect biomarkers are within normal
range (Table 3), their negative association with uri-
nary perchlorate is of interest, such as decreased HDL
among men and decreased HGB and HCT among
both men and women. Reports have been published
on decreased levels of HDL among subjects with sub-
clinical hypothyroidism.7,9,11,18­20,24,25 The herbicide
2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) which is
known to displace T4 from its binding site on the car-
rier protein transthyretin26 and thus may be involved
in TH dysfunction, was shown to be associated with
decreased levels of HDL.27 Regarding associations
between direct and indirect indicators of thyroid dys-
function, statistically significant negative associations
have been observed between HDL and values of TSH
within the reference range.28,29 Among older subjects,
TSH and HGB were significantly inversely correlated
among those with hypothyroidism and anemia.30
Patients with chronic stable heart failure showed that
those that developed hypothyroidism, subclinical

hypothyroidism, or euthyroid syndrome (normalTSH,
decreased T3 with/without decreased T4) had lower
HGB and HCT.31 Although in the current study sub-
jects with thyroid related diseases had been excluded,
nevertheless some associations between direct and
indirect indicators were observed, such as TSH and
HDL among men, T4 and HDL among women, T4
and HGB, HCT among men (Table 5).
Use of HDLlevels as an indirect measure of thyroid
hormone dysfunction may not be valid for any study
population. The purpose of this study was to investi-
gate associations with perchlorate among healthy sub-
jects, in order to observe initial effects associated with
TH perturbation. In general, plasma concentrations of
HDL as a measure of HDL functionality depends on
health status.32 The atheroprotective characteristics
of HDL are based on the reverse cholesterol trans-
port mechanism (RCT), inhibition of LDL oxidation,
and anti-inflammatory 
properties. In susceptible sub-
jects, HDL may become dysfunctional, lose its RCT
promoting and antioxidant characteristics, and even
become pro-inflammatory. In the current study, sub-
jects with previous chronic diseases were excluded
from the analyses.Therefore, the observed association
between urinary perchlorate and HDL among men in
this relatively healthy 
subpopulation may reflect an

early indication of interference of perchlorate with
TH action.
Unexpected results were observed for the group
of women aged 50­85. These women seemed to
be largely unaffected by perchlorate in contrast to the
younger women. However, this assumption may be
incorrect. A large percentage of the women in this age
group was excluded from the study (56%, 214 out of
382), because of previous diseases or because they
were prescribed thyroid hormones, with the result
that the 50­85 year old women remaining in the study
were generally healthy. In comparison, the following
percentages were excluded from the other groups:
14% (52 out of 384) for girls ages 6­14; 19% (135
out of 719) for women, ages 15­49, including preg-
nant women; 12% (71 out of 572) for boys, age 6­19;
33% (252 out of 761) for men, age 20­85.
Comparison of the non-pregnant women of repro-
ductive age and the pregnant women based on the
unadjusted data (Table 3) showed that with regard
to HGB and HCT, the non-pregnant women showed
a U-shaped pattern based on perchlorate quintiles,
while the pregnant women showed a more linear
decreasing association. Before one can conclude that
perchlorate is adversely associated with HGB and
HCT among pregnant women, the following informa-
tion should be considered. It has been shown that both
high and low maternal HGB is associated with poor
pregnancy outcomes, such as increased rates of pre-
term births and stillbirths. The optimal values of this
U-shaped pattern of HGB among pregnant women
with regard to adverse birth outcomes, is represented
by the bottom part of the "U", with a reported range
of 9­11 g/dL for the lowest maternal HGB recorded
during the pregnancy, and a range of 11­13 g/dL for
the first recorded HGB value in another study.33,34 This
decrease in HGB is thought to be due to a healthy
plasma volume expansion associated with pregnancy.
Therefore, interpretation of the decreasing HGB val-
ues among pregnant women associated with perchlo-
rate becomes more complicated. A larger study group
of pregnant women is needed to solve the question
if perchlorate exposure is associated with enhance-
ment of the plasma volume expansion (non-adverse
effect), or with decreased erythropoiesis (adverse
effect). A recent study involving pregnant women
only, observed that perchlorate exposure did not affect
thyroid hormones in either euthyroid or hypothyroid
women.35 An editorial on the impact of perchlorate
exposure during early pregnancy speculated that per-
chlorate may have more subtle effects than changes
of maternal thyroid hormones, or may have an effect
on the fetus without having an effect on maternal thy-
roid hormones.36
Results from the regression analyses showed
that use of a continuous exposure variable, such as
log-transformed urinary perchlorate, which repre-
sents the average population response, can be mis-
leading when the association is nonlinear. Nonlinear
responses associated with low-dose exposures are a

characteristic of hormone-like chemicals. The initial
receptor-mediated responses are linear at low satura-
tion or occupation of the receptors. With increasing
exposure, ie, higher receptor saturation, the effects
weaken. No effect may be observed at the highest
exposures. This may lead to a U- or inverted U-shaped
response curve.37 Such nonlinear responses can be
quantified by including a quadratic term for the expo-
sure in the regression. This allows for an increase/
decrease of the response followed by a decrease/
increase at higher exposures. However, a regression
model using exposure quantiles is easier to interpret
and has been used in other studies. For example, an
observational study on the association of perfluorooc-
tanoic acid on thyroid disease showed that responses
were not necessarily linear for increasing quartiles
of the exposure variable.38 A nonlinear association
was observed between persistent organic pollutants
(POPs) and type-2 diabetes.39 In this study, the second
sextile of the combined POPs showed the strongest

association. To measure the response occurring at low
levels of exposure, the referent group should be based
on non-exposed subjects or subjects with very low
levels of exposure. The choice of quantiles depends on
the size of the study population. In the current study,
for example, an association of HDL with perchlorate
among men, ages 20­85 was observed in the non-

adjusted data (Table 3), where a decrease in HDL was
observed in the second and third quintiles, followed
by an increase in the fourth and fifth quintiles. The
adjusted data for men, ages 20­85 (Table 4A) show
a similar pattern with stronger decreases in the 2nd
and 3rd quintiles (-0.088 and -0.094, respectively)
followed by weaker associations in the 4th and 5th
quintiles. Combining the 2nd and 3rd quintiles pro-
duced statistical significance compared to the lowest
quintile. No such association was observed when the
lowest quartile instead of quintile was used as the
referent.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional study has generated hypotheses
for mechanistic studies on the effects of perchlorate
exposure. Its results indicate that adverse effects
associated with perchlorate may be underestimated
when only circulating levels of TH (direct measures)
are considered. Additional use of indirect biomarkers,
such as HDL, HGB, and HCT, may contribute to a
more complete picture of initial biological responses
to perchlorate. Future studies need to confirm these
results in healthy subjects. The effects seen for preg-
nant women should be investigated in a larger dataset.
In addition, use of these indirect biomarkers associ-
ated with perchlorate, should be studied in already
compromised subjects.
