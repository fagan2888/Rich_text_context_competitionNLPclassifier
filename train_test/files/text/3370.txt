Introduction
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays
a pivotal role in maintaining a neurohormonal imbalance
that promotes heart failure (HF).1­5 Neurohormonal activa-
tion acts to modify cardiac structure and function, inducing
both left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and collagen net-
work remodeling,6 changes that increase cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality.7
It is well known that drugs interfering with the RAAS
attenuate or even reverse LV remodeling and improve prog-
nosis;8­10 aldosterone levels often remain elevated or even
increase in these patients because of the well-known
`escape' phenomenon.11,12 In addition to the other compo-
nents of the RAAS, aldosterone directly promotes LV over-
load, hypertrophy, tissue-mediated responses (increase in
cytokines, adhesion molecules, and endothelial dysfunc-
tion), and myocardial fibrosis.13,14
The pathophysiological rationale for aldosterone block-
ade in the treatment of HF is supported by large-scale rand-
omized clinical trials demonstrating that anti-aldosterone
agents, when added to optimal therapy, consistently reduce
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with
advanced HF (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
III and IV),15 in patients with systolic HF and mild symp-
toms (NYHA class II),16 and in those with systolic dysfunc-
tion and HF following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).17

mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
on risk of mortality in patients with heart
failure

Abstract
Introduction: Several studies have definitively shown the benefit of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)
in patients with heart failure (HF). However, very few prior studies examined the relationship between the timing of
initiation of MRAs and prognosis. In addition, on this topic, there is no information regarding the specific population of
patients suffering a first episode of decompensated congestive HF.
Methods: We studied a homogenous cohort of patients discharged alive from our hospital after a first episode of
decompensated congestive HF, in order to clarify the association between time of aldosterone receptor antagonist
(ARA) initiation (within the first 90 days after hospital discharge) and mortality. Our population was composed of a
series of consecutive patients. All-cause mortality was compared between patients who initiated MRAs at discharge
(early group) and those who initiated MRAs one month later and up to 90 days after discharge (delayed group). We used
prescription time distribution matching to control for survival difference between groups.
Results: The early and delayed groups consisted of 365 and 320 patients, respectively. During the one-year follow-up, a
significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for early versus delayed
initiation were 1.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 2.84) at six months, and 1.93 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.14) at one year.
Conclusions: Delay of MRA initiation up to 30 to 90 days after discharge implies a significant increase in mortality
compared with MRA initiation at discharge, after a first episode of decompensate congestive HF.

Current guidelines recommend, in fact, using mineralocor-
ticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for all symptomatic
patients (NYHA class II­IV) on top of optimal therapy,
including -blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor antagonists
(ARBs).18,19
Only two studies examined the relationship between the
timing of initiation of MRAs and prognosis. The first of
these is the study by Adamopoulos et al.,20 who performed
a preliminary exploratory analysis of the Eplerenone Post-
AMI Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival (EPHESUS) trial.
This study demonstrated that an earlier aldosterone block-
ade improved outcome in patients with HF, and this benefit
was not observed when the aldosterone receptor antagonist
(ARA) was initiated later. The other study is by Hayashi et
al.,21 who found that the treatment with MRAs within 24
hours after an AMI may prevent post-infarct LV remode-
ling. However, there is no information concerning how the
beneficial effect of aldosterone inhibition relates to the tim-
ing of MRA initiation in the specific population of patients
suffering a first episode of decompensated congestive HF.
Using the database of our hospital, we selected a homog-
enous cohort of consecutive patients in order to study the
association between time of MRAinitiation (within the first
90 days after hospital discharge) and mortality in patients
with HF discharged alive after a first episode of decompen-
sated congestive HF. Risk of mortality was computed com-
paring patients who initiated MRAs at discharge (early
group), who we postulate to be advantaged, and those who
initiated MRAs one months later, up to 90 days after dis-
charge (delayed group).
Subjects and methods
Study cohort
Eligible patients were residents of the Province of Modena,
who were discharged alive from the Modena Policlinico
Hospital after a first episode of decompensated congestive
HF between January 2007 and March 2010. Follow-up data
were available for these patients until April 2011.
"MRA users" (see definition below) who were dis-
charged alive from their first hospitalization for decompen-
sated congestive HF were included. Patients were excluded
if they met  one of the following conditions: (1) presence
of severe comorbidities (significant renal impairment
(defined as reduction of the glomerular filtration rate, cal-
culated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equa-
tion, < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2), dementia, or malignancy); (2)
age  85 years. These two groups of patients were frail and
likely to have a short life expectancy, which may have
obscured the effect of treatments; and (3) a total length of
hospital stay  three days.
Patients who filled a prescription of an MRA  90 days
after discharge were identified as "MRA users." Those who
had a prescription dispensed at discharge formed the "early
group," and those who filled a prescription 30 to 90 days
after discharge formed the "delayed group."
The study outcome was defined as mortality due to any
cause. All patients were followed for the earliest occur-
rence of death or one year after discharge.
Data source
Data were obtained from the general database of our hospi-
tal, which contains information concerning hospital admis-
sions, discharge reports, inpatient physician encounters,
and dispensed medications. Prescription information
includes type of medication and dispensed dose.
Death information was obtained from the Modena pro-
vincial registry office.
Detailed information on patients' baseline characteris-
tics, including medication and doses, was recorded at dis-
charge (baseline).
Baseline characteristics
General information, including patients' age, gender, and
co-morbidity, was noted at discharge. Concurrent use of
major cardiac medications was recorded for beta blockers,
nitrates, diuretics, warfarin, digoxin, ACE-Is, ARBs, and
MRAs. In addition, data included: date of cardiac proce-
dures after the index hospital admission (catheterization,
percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery
bypass grafting), and length of hospital stay.
Prescription time distribution matching
By definition, patients in the delayed group survived at
least the first month and up to 90 days, whereas patients in
the early group may have had an event any time after dis-
charge. Although the risk of death is higher after discharge,
an excessive amount of early events is expected to occur in
the early group. This systematic difference in time to treat-
ment initiation may result in biased estimates if not cor-
rected for either at the design or analysis level. To address
this between-group survival difference, we used the method
of prescription time distribution matching to define time of
study entry (T0). The method considered the dispensing
date of the first MRA prescription (the date of post-
discharge visit) was considered to be the time of study entry
of the delayed users. Early users were assigned a T0 that
was selected at random from the observed prescription time
distribution of the delayed users. Those who died before the
assigned T0 were excluded. The two groups were then fol-
lowed from their respective T0 values, and onward.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to compare baseline patient
characteristics between groups.
Rossi et al. 121
To exclude the possibility that the delayed users were
late to fill the prescription because they underwent more
post-discharge procedures or hospital readmissions, we
examined the period between discharge and matched pre-
scription time for rates of cardiac procedures (percutaneous
coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and
catheterization) and hospital admissions for congestive HF.
Survival in the two groups was displayed by a Kaplan­
Meier curve. A multivariate Cox's regression model was
used to obtain the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality between
the delayed (reference) and early groups after adjusting for
baseline characteristics. Mortality hazards were evaluated
at six months and at one year after discharge.
A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Cohort and baseline characteristics
In our cohort, 689 consecutive patients filled an MRA pre-
scription during the first 90 days after discharge. Of these,
365 patients (52.6% of the entire population) filled an MRA
prescription at discharge (early group), and 320 patients
(47.4%) initiated an MRA 30 to 90 days after discharge
(delayed group).
After matching on study entry between the early and
delayed users, the early group had an assigned T0 distribu-
tion identical to that of the delayed users (median: 55 days;
interquartile range: 40 to 72 years). There were four sub-
jects who were excluded from the early group because they
died before their assigned T0.
A comparison between early and delayed users after pre-
scription time distribution matching showed similar demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics (Table 1). Also, as
regards the type and dose of the prescribed drugs, we did
not note any significant difference. Specifically, types and
dose of prescribed MRAs are summarized in Table 2.
Patients did not significantly differ in terms of types and
dose of prescribed MRAs.
Treatment rates after discharge and up to
matched prescription time
There was no difference in the rates of post-discharge cardiac
proceduresandhospitaladmissionsuptomatchedT0between
the early and delayed groups. For post-discharge cardiac pro-
cedures, rates in the early and delayed groups were 9% and
10%, respectively (p = 0.32). For post-discharge hospital
admissions, rates were 6% and 7% (p = 0.26).
Effect associated with difference in timing of
MRA initiation
Twenty-six patients in the early group (7.1%) and 43 in the
delayed group (13.4%) died in the first year after first hospital
admission. Kaplan­Meier curve (Figure 1) and multivariate
Cox's regression analysis showed a significant difference in
mortality due to delay of MRA initiation.
Adjusted HRs for mortality for delayed versus early ini-
tiation were 1.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.96 to 2.84) at
six months, and 1.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.18 to 3.14)
at one year after discharge (comparison was controlled for
survival bias by prescription time distribution matching).
Discussion
The present study evaluated the effectiveness of early MRA
use compared with delayed initiation in a population of
patients hospitalized for a first episode of decompensated
HF. Compared with a delay in MRA initiation, early users
show a significant difference in mortality compared with
delayed users during the first year after discharge. Based on
the survival curve, a delay of only one month in the admin-
istration of an MRA implies approximately a doubling of
mortality risk after one year. This aspect may be important
from a practical point of view, because even the most recent
guidelines do not provide guidance regarding how early to
start MRA treatment after hospitalization for congestive
HF. The present study provides a clear indication for use of
MRAs as early as possible, on top of the treatment (includ-
ing ACE-I or ARB and beta-blocker), preferably at dis-
charge after an episode of decompensate HF.
The reason to define delayed use as one month to 90 days
in the present study is threefold. First, this is determined by
the actual prescription pattern. The first 90-day period cap-
tured practically all the first MRA prescriptions in the year
after discharge.22 Second, the highest risk of readmission
and death occurs during the first month after discharge.23,24
Third, the EPHESUS trial suggests that earlier eplerenone
administration improved outcomes in patients with HF, that
this benefit was not demonstrated when eplerenone was ini-
tiated later,20 and that the reduction in mortality from any
cause was apparent within the first 30 days of randomiza-
tion.25 Therefore, it is important, in our opinion, to examine
the effect on mortality as a result of an initiation delay  one
month compared with initiation at discharge.
Pathophysiological effects of aldosterone and
"aldosterone escape" in congestive heart failure
Mineralocorticoid antagonism attenuates cardiovascular
damage by mechanisms that involve direct blockade of
aldosterone's cardiovascular pro-inflammatory and pro-
fibrotic effects.26 Aldosterone induces fibrosis in the heart,
blood vessels, and kidney,25 and the antagonism of miner-
alocorticoid receptors has been associated with reduced
fibrosis in human myocardium, limited ventricular remod-
eling, and improved survival in patients with ventricular
dysfunction and heart failure.14,25­28 Our results suggest a
greater benefit in terms of survival if MRA treatment is
started as early as possible.

However, with ACE-I therapy now given routinely for
congestive HF, the clinical importance of aldosterone had
previously been overlooked because ACE-I therapy was
widely believed to suppress aldosterone production effec-
tively by `upstream' RAAS blockade. Increasingly, it is
becoming evident that following an acute fall in aldoster-
one in response to administration of an ACE-I, the level of
aldosterone rises again, and indeed returns to baseline in
almost all patients, a phenomenon known as "aldosterone
escape."11,12,29­33 Even when an ACE-I is given in combina-
tion with an ARB, aldosterone levels remain uncon-
trolled.34,35 Additionally, there is evidence that aldosterone
escape, in turn, might promote release of angiotensin II via
a positive feedback loop that stimulates ACE in the vascu-
lature.36 This, and the progressive escape of aldosterone,
are thought to contribute to "ACE-I resistance," whereby
the effect of ACE-I becomes blunted, and beneficial effects
on mortality decrease over time.37,38 The results of our
study allow us to postulate that the escape phenomenon
occurs rapidly in patients who have had an episode of
decompensated congestive HF. MRAs, in turn, are able to
antagonize the deleterious effects of aldosterone, resulting
in a beneficial effect, ultimately, on patient mortality.
ARAs utilized in the present study
While in the United States the most widely used MRA is
represented by spironolactone, in Italy canrenone and
potassium canrenoate are also used.
Potassium canrenoate is a competitive non-selective
inhibitor of aldosterone receptor; its pharmacologic activity
is due to a rapid conversion to canrenone, which is the active
metabolite of potassium canrenoate and spironolactone.39
Potassium canrenoate is rapidly and completely absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract and bypasses the liver
unchanged. Canrenone and canrenoate are in enzymatic
equilibrium in vivo, in which canrenoate represents the
derived -hydroxycarboxylic acid.40 The bioavailability and
water solubility of potassium canrenoate and canrenone are
greater than those of spironolactone; therefore the number
of active metabolites of the latter is considerably greater.40
In Italy eplerenone, a selective aldosterone receptor
blocker, is not commercially available. All of the aldoster-
one inhibitors used in the present study are, in consequence,
not selective.
In Italy, overall, MRAs are little used: In 2011 the mean
number of doses of MRAs consumed daily by 1000 inhab-
itants was 3.5, a very small quantity compared with 88.5
doses of ACE-Is, 56.3 of calcium channel blockers, 53.2 of
ARBs, 38.5 of beta adrenergic blockers, 24.3 of loop diu-
retics, and 6.0 of thiazide diuretics.41 However, the present
study is indicative of current clinical practices in a large
Italian referral center. Our group, together with other refer-
ral Italian centers, is part of the AREA-in-CHF network, a
research group that demonstrated in patients with HF posi-
tive effects of canrenone in preventing LV remodeling28
and in improving myocardial mechano-energetic
efficiency.42

Strengths and limitations of the study
The strengths of the present study are: first, the homogene-
ous cohort of patients; and second, the primary end-point of
the study, represented by mortality from any cause. This is
universally accepted as the strongest end-point in prognos-
tic studies.
Despite appropriate design and analyses, this study has
several limitations. First, the study is prone to biases
because of its observational nature. Although the bias that
results from confounding by indication is minor, because
all patients are MRA users, there are likely uncharacterized
factors that may confound the timing of initiation. Some of
them could be related to clinical practice and patient dis-
ease severity, which could obscure the possible benefit
associated with early MRA initiation. Despite adjustment
for a wide spectrum of characteristics, it is possible to have
residual confounding in the comparisons. Second, survival
bias in the comparison of early versus delayed MRA initia-
tion may affect the validity of the results. We controlled for
this bias by matching the time of study entry between the
two groups using prescription time distribution matching.
However, due to matching, we could not study the effect in
the first month. Third, our study is limited by the data and
clinical practice during the study period, although patients
were similar with regard to types of prescribed MRA and
used dosages.
Conclusions
In patients suffering from HF, a delay of MRA initiation up
to 30 days after discharge implies a significant increase in
mortality compared with MRA initiation at discharge after
a first episode of decompensated congestive HF. Subsequent
studies, preferably randomized, should confirm these find-
ings. However, on the basis of the results of our study, it
seems reasonable to suggest from a clinical point of view
that patients with HF in whom there is a clear indication to
use an MRA, should have the possibility of starting this
treatment as soon as possible.
