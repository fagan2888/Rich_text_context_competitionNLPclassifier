Introduction
We present here the findings of a realist multilevel situational
analysis of maternal depression. The purpose is to contribute
to a realist theory building study that aims to explain neigh-
borhood context, maternal depression, and the developmen-
tal origins of health and disease.
That the early years play an important role in the genesis
of later adult health and disease is well recognized. Intensive
efforts at theory construction seek to explain complex genetic
and environmental mechanisms that interact to influence this
hypothesized developmental origin of health and disease
(Gluckman, Hanson, & Beedle, 2007). The environments
implicated are intrauterine, the maternal­infant dyad, family
and household life, and external social and physical environ-
ments (Culhane & Elo, 2005; Matthews & Meaney, 2005;
Misra, Guyer, & Allston, 2003).
Postnatal depression and anxiety have consistently been
demonstrated to adversely impact on maternal­infant inter-
action and attachment (Beck, 1995; Martins & Gaffan, 2000;
Murray, Stanley, Hooper, King, & Fiori-Cowley, 1996) and
subsequent child cognitive, language, behavioral, and psy-
chological problems (Cogill, Caplan, Alexandra, Robson, &
Kumar, 1986; Cummings & Davies, 1994; Downey &
Coyne, 1990; Gelford & Teti, 1990; Murray, Hipwell,

Each Is in Different Circumstances
Anyway: A Realist Multilevel Situational
Analysis of Maternal Depression in South
Western Sydney, Australia

Abstract
We present here a realist multilevel situational analysis of maternal depression. We use situational analysis to identify
the interaction of mothers with social structures and the possible causal influence of those social structures on her well-
being. The analysis moves from an emergent empirical approach toward the more reflexive and abductive approach of
situational analysis, thus better informing our abductive reasoning and the generation of theory. Critical realism and symbolic
interactionism provide the methodological underpinning for the study. The setting was South Western Sydney, Australia.
Interviews of mothers and practitioners were analyzed using open coding to enable maximum emergence. Situational analysis
was then undertaken using situational and social worlds/arena maps. Home and neighborhood situational analysis mapping
and analysis of relations identified the following concepts: (a) expectations and dreams, (b) marginalization and being alone,
(c) loss or absence of power and control, and (d) support and nurturing. The neighborhood and macro-arena situational
analysis mapping and analysis of relations identified the following concepts: (a) social support networks, social cohesion and
social capital; (b) services planning and delivery and social policy; and (c) global economy, business, and media. Emerging was
the centrality of being alone and expectations lost as possible triggers of stress and depression within circumstances where
media portrays expectations of motherhood that are shattered by reality and social marginalization. We further observe
that powerful global economic and political forces are having an impact on the local situations. The challenge for policy and
practice is to support families within this adverse regional and global economic context.

2006). Postnatal depression may also be associated with sub-
sequent maternal and childhood obesity (Herring et al., 2008;
Surkan, Kawachi, & Peterson, 2008), not breast feed (Dennis
& McQueen, 2009; Henderson, Evans, Straton, Priest, &
Hagan, 2003), and maternal health harming behaviors such
as tobacco and drug addiction (Cinciripini et al., 2010;
Lancaster et al., 2010; Rubio, Kraemer, Farrell, & Day,
2008).
We have previously reported on individual-level psycho-
social predictors of postnatal depression in South Western
Sydney (Eastwood, Phung, & Barnett, 2011) and proposed
that the findings were consistent with group-level socioeco-
nomic deprivation, neighborhood environment, social net-
works, and ethnic diversity having causal effects on postnatal
depressive symptomatology and other perinatal outcomes.
That proposition is consistent with a recent qualitative study
of pathways from neighborhoods to mental well-being which
found that neighborhood affordability, negative community
factors including crime and vandalism, and social makeup
including unemployment and poverty were felt to be associ-
ated with poor mental well-being (O'Campo, Salmon, &
Burke, 2009).
Theoretical bio-psychosocial (Engel, 1977), eco-social
(Krieger, 2001), and bio-ecological (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci,
1994) models have made an immense contribution to our
understanding of this interplay between human biology and
context, but Ben-Shlomo and Kuh (2002) go further and
argue that a life course approach is not limited to individuals
within a single generation but "should intertwine biological
and social transmission of risk across generations." They
extend the models proposed above to link across generations
and to include the potential role of household, neighborhood,
and national influences acting across time and individuals.
The words of a mother in our study--"each is in different
circumstances anyway" challenged our view of those models
by suggesting that every mother's situation was different. The
predominantly hierarchical nature of the above models may
limit our attempts to understand the "deep" and "immediate"
impact of personal situations on genetic, developmental,
familial, cultural, social, and intergenerational mechanisms.
In contrast to the above layered conceptual frameworks,
Clarke (2005, p. 72) in her work on Situational Analysis
argues that
everything in the situation both constitutes and affects most
everything else in the situation in some way . . . People and
things, humans and nonhumans, fields of practice, discourses,
disciplinary and other regimes/formations, symbols,
controversies, organizations and institutions, each and all can be
present and mutually consequential. Here the macro/meso/micro
distinctions dissolve in the presence/absence.
We will use situational analysis here to identify the inter-
action of mothers with social structures and the possible
causal influence of those social structures on her well-being.
Method
Critical realism and symbolic interactionism provide the
meta-theory and philosophical roots for this realist multi-
level situational analysis. The study reported here is part of a
critical realist mixed method multilevel study that seeks to
identify and explain complex perinatal contextual social and
psychosocial mechanisms that may influence the develop-
mental origins of health and disease with a focus on the role
of postnatal depression (Eastwood, Jalaludin, & Kemp,
2014). The main study used various qualitative and quantita-
tive methods, including emergent qualitative analysis
(Eastwood, Kemp, & Jalaludin, 2014, 2015), non-linear prin-
cipal component (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung,
Barnett, & Tobin, 2012) and exploratory factor analysis
(Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, & Phung, 2014b), visualization
and cluster analysis (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, &
Adusumilli, 2013), and Bayesian ecological and multilevel
exploratory spatial analysis (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, &
Phung, 2013, 2014a; Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, &
Barnett, 2013).
We have previously reported the protocol for the main
study which used both Emergent and Construction Phases of
a realist Explanatory Theory Building Method (Figure 1).
The study reported here was part of the Emergent Phase
where the focus is on observation, pattern recognition,
abstract thinking, concept formulation, and theory genera-
tion. Three methods of theory generation proposed by Haig
(2005) are Grounded Theory Method, Exploratory Factor
Analysis, and Heuristics. Here, we will use the Grounded
Theory method, "Situational Analysis," as advanced by
Clarke. The Construction Phase of the Main Study will use
the findings of the Emergent Phase to construct a conceptual
framework, theory and model. The Construction Phase
methods include the following: (a) defining stratified levels,
(b) analytic resolution, (c) abductive reasoning, (d) com-
parative analysis (triangulation), (e) retroduction, (f) postu-
late and proposition development, (g) comparison and
assessment of theories, and (h) conceptual frameworks and
model development.

Setting, Sampling, and Recruitment
The study was approved by the University of New South
Wales Human Research Ethics Committee. The setting was
four local government areas (LGAs) in South Western
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia including communities
where we had identified clusters of postnatal depression
(Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, & Adusumilli, 2013).
The region has substantial social disadvantage, and has lower
education attainment and lower income levels then other
parts of New South Wales. There is a diverse multicultural
population with 28.4% of the population born overseas com-
pared with 17.8% for the rest of New South Wales. A large
shopping center, from a global chain, has recently been con-
structed adjacent to a recently enlarged University Teaching
Hospital.
Parent participants were from existing "playgroups." The
three "playgroups," with three to seven members, were pur-
posefully selected from (a) a community with dense housing,
low socioeconomic circumstances, and high numbers of
overseas born mothers; (b) a community with predominantly
single dwellings, mixed ethnicity, and average socioeco-
nomic circumstances; and (c) a community with predomi-
nantly single dwellings, low socioeconomic circumstances,
and high numbers of overseas born mothers. The groups
were facilitated by a research assistant. This avoided coer-
cion and kept researcher distance. The focus group discus-
sion asked, why there might be more or less depression in
some suburbs, what the characteristics of those suburbs
might be, and whether there are things at a city, state, and
national level that might increase or decrease a mother's
depression. Based on emerging themes, the third focus group
was asked whether communities with high numbers of ethnic
groups were likely to have higher rates of depression.
Selection of participants (n = 8) for practitioner inter-
views was by purposeful sampling. Potential participants
were identified based on gender, LGA where they worked,
experience with population subgroups, professional or indus-
try background, and emerging concepts. Interview guides for
the initial interviews were as for the focus groups. The ques-
tions asked changed as analysis was undertaken and concep-
tual theory emerged.
Analysis
Analysis of interview transcripts involved initial open cod-
ing followed by axial and selective coding (Charmaz, 2006;
Saldana, 2009). The interview transcripts were coded line-
by-line and paragraph-by-paragraph. Each "incident" was
coded into as many categories that it might fit during the
early stages of concept and category generation to enable
maximum emergence of patterns and relationships (Glaser,
1978). Constant comparative analysis was used, including
across quantitative and literature analysis, to identify regu-
larities, variations, and contrasts that would contribute to
emerging insights. Situational analysis was used to provide
more reflection and in-depth analysis of the discursive ele-
ments. For the purpose of this situational analysis, we used
two types of maps: situational (messy and ordered), and
social worlds/arenas (Clarke, 2005; Clarke & Friese, 2007).
To consider the breadth of issues surrounding a situation,
messy situational maps allow for the examination of all the
discourses related to the situation, including those produced
by individuals, groups, and institutions. The ordered situa-
tional maps frame and organize the discourses that emerge
from messy maps. The social worlds/arenas maps were
used to analyze individual and collective actors, key non-
human elements, and the arena(s) within which they are
engaged. The data for the situational maps and the social
world/arenas maps were drawn from interviews, local
observations, spatial studies, and from documentary
sources.As observed by Clarke and Friese, the maps offered
meso-level interpretations of the situation including social
organizational and institutional dimensions (Clarke &
Friese, 2007, p. 370).
The observations and experience of the researchers, from
working in the South West Sydney community, were entered
into the analysis. It is here in the situational analysis, there-
fore, that the researchers as clinicians and population health
practitioners are able to bring to the table their knowledge of
the "situation" in South West Sydney. Clarke (2005) defends
this approach as follows:
The last caveat is perhaps the most radical. Researchers should
use their own experiences of doing the research as data for
making these maps. There is a saying in the world of qualitative
inquiry that the person doing the research is the "research
instrument." I am further asserting that that instrument is to be
used more fully in doing situational analyses . . . Beginning even
before a research topic is decided upon, we notice and store
information, impressions, and images about topic areas and
issues . . . Part of the process of making situational maps is to try
and get such information, assumptions, and so on out on the
table and, if appropriate, into the maps. (p. 85)
Results
Home and Neighborhood Analysis
The messy working maps described by Clarke were used
extensively throughout the analysis but are not presented
here. The more structured maps (Tables 1 and 2) present the
data in terms of the situational elements such as individual
and collective human actors, silent actors, discursive con-
structions, political elements, spatial elements, and major
issues and debates. Table 1 focuses this analysis on the moth-
ers'close home and neighborhood arenas, while the contribu-
tion to her situation of wider arenas, is expanded in Table 2.
The home and neighborhood situational analysis mapping
and analysis of relations identified the following concepts:
(a) expectations and dreams, (b) marginalization and being

alone, (c) loss or absence of power and control, and (d) sup-
port and nurturing.
The findings of situational analysis were then used to
inform the building of the social worlds/arenas map (Figure
2) and together both analyses contributed to our findings.
Figure 2 is the social worlds and social arenas map of
mothers' home and neighborhood. What is this map telling
us? First, there is the domestic or home social arena drawn as
the dotted circle with an internal light orange shade. The dot-
ted line means that the home is permeable to multiple actions.
The arena is made up of few actors: mother, baby, father, and
others such as mothers' sister, mother, midwife, visiting
nurse, and friends. The home is the domain where mother
and baby spend most of the day. It is here that mothers
receive, or do not receive their closest emotional support. It
is also here that control is lost and expectations are most
manifest. Loss of control and failure of expectations may be
manifest with a crying, vomit, nappies, unsettled and sick
infant, unsupportive partner, and increased financial stress.
The expectations are that the house, baby, and relations will
be perfect. Those expectations are raised through family,
friends, services, radio, magazines, and television. But it is
here that expectations are sometimes lost and mothers may
feel alone, unsupported, and even marginalized. The physi-
cal environment adds to stress with houses that are hot, cold,
moldy, and isolated from amenities.
A second arena is the local neighborhood. In this case, it
is depicted as the immediate close environment. This includes
neighbors, mothers' groups, buses, general practitioners
(GPs), and nurses. Other aspects of the neighborhood arena
are explored in more depth below. Important also are the atti-
tudes of the local neighborhood to sole parents and teenage
mothers. These attitudes may be influences by the cultural
and religious composition of the local neighborhood or wide
community.
Family is very important to most mothers. Her mother is
close even when she is physically distant. The family arena
can span generations and continents. With it comes culture,
religion, emotional support, nurturing, and sometimes finan-
cial help. But family can also bring expectations and atti-
tudes to sole or teenage parenthood leaving the mother
unsupported and alone.
Support networks are a well-recognized determinant of
maternal depression. This was supported through the focus
groups and interviews with practitioners. The support net-
work arena contains: school friends, sisters and brothers,
neighbors, new friends, and mothers' groups. Also necessary
are cars and telephones. With the support networks come
connections, nurturing of mothers, and not being alone.
There may, however, also be expectations of parenting prac-
tices and pressures to conform. Aspects of support networks
overlap with the neighborhood arena, government arena,
family arena, and services arena.
The ServicesArena includes a wide range of public and pri-
vate services and utilities that reach into the lives of mothers
and their families. There is close connection with midwives,
Figure 2. Social worlds/arenas map of mothers' home and neighborhood.
Note. Center Link is a Government Agency where families receive income support.
Eastwood et al. 7
nurses, GPs, family support workers, and mothers'groups. The
services support the provision of nurturing environments and
connections. They also, however, influence and make expecta-
tions of mothers and families.
The arena for government support and policy is only
lightly touched on in the map. It is clear that this domain
reaches into the close lives of the family members through
provision of income support, maternity and paternity leave
policies. The nature of these policies reaches into the lives of
the mothers who commented on the means testing of current
policies pleading that all parents with babies need support.
The financial stress that impacts on families appears to have
its origins in higher levels of government policy. The govern-
ment arena also places expectations on families which are
manifest in policy requirements and expectations of parents.
Expectations and dreams. The discursive elements of the situ-
ational mapping highlighted the importance of expectations.
Absent was discussion of the dreams that mothers might
have. Yet implicit in comments by mothers were their dreams
for the perfect baby, home, and future.
Both mothers and practitioners felt that society and moth-
ers expected to (Beck, 1993) take home the perfect baby and
that everything was "going to be fine." The reality is often
different to that portrayed in media such as the "Huggies
adverts." The shattering of dreams and expectations was
described in a range of different ways.
For mothers with few resources, their hopes for the future
may be dashed by the impact of the new baby on both finan-
cial and emotional resources. This may be especially true for
a young woman who had plans for her life. The reality is
different as expressed by one practitioner.
[Parenting] takes a great deal of emotional energy and to do it
well, to be available for children and provide all their needs.
Parents that are distracted by adverse environmental factors
such as finance or domestic violence don't have that energy.
For some disadvantaged parents, there may, however, be
no expectations or dreams. One practitioner put it this way:
I am not sure whether it is hope or whether there is expectation
. . . Expectation is the better way to put it. These people expect
life to get better whereas the other disadvantaged people who
have been here, may be 2nd or 3rd generation think this is it.
Mothers implied that they had been "in control" of the
lives (and also their husbands) and "expected" to be in con-
trol after the baby was born. But this was not always the case
and several mothers when speaking of the "loss of control"
implied that this was not their expectation of how mother-
hood was going to be. With the birth of the baby planning
ahead was no longer possible.
Society has expectations of what a "good mother" will be
like as discussed in relation to the "Huggies Advert." One
practitioner felt that some mothers "don't think they are
doing a good job." Mothers agreed with this expectation.
Some spoke of expectations raised by helping services such
as midwives. One mother talked of the stress associated with
the nurse visit:
Now I have to get myself ready, make sure I don't look like I
have . . ., so they don't think I am a bad mother.
Discussion about the home visit also focused on expecta-
tions related to "you are not bonding with your child and you
are expected to," and "I am going to be graded . . . please
don't put me in the high risk."
One practitioner spoke of "career women losing it."
Several practitioners agreed with the mothers who had spo-
ken of the shattering of expectations of what motherhood
would be like. One practitioner put it like this:
Career women that have been working, who have had high
expectations when they have been working high achievers in
their career, suddenly with a baby thing are crashing in on top of
them and it is not going the way they want.
Marginalization and"being alone." The situational analysis and
social worlds/arenas maps confirmed and strengthened the
importance that marginalization and isolation may play. The
earlier analysis (Eastwood et al., 2015) had identified the cat-
egory of marginalization and isolation and linked it to "not
belonging," poverty, access, language, culture, single parent-
hood, community safety, and living in new neighborhoods.
Examination of the social worlds map drew attention to
the situation that may be experienced by most mothers.
Buried in the voices of the mothers were stories of "being
alone" with the crying infant, with an absent partner, mother,
or other support friend. Sometimes, mothers spoke of not
being able to get out seeing their friends. They spoke of how
important the phone call from the nurse was. The descrip-
tions were powerful and suggested that this situation is expe-
rienced by many mothers. The link between "being alone,"
"depression," and partner support is clearly apparent in one
mother's story:
I go then, thank God Matt's with me. So he can give me the hug,
during the night when I am so depressed. That mental help as
well. Just Matt going. "It is ok. I am home. I can relieve you. Go
have a shower."
Her related comment was, "I think a single parent . . . I
don't know how they do it?"
Loss of power and control. The initial analysis identified moth-
ers' "loss of control" as contributing to the development of
depressive symptoms. That analysis identified three subcat-
egories related to personal relationships, birth of a new baby,
and conflicting advice.
8 SAGE Open
Also evident in the discursive elements of the situational
analysis was the lack, or absence, of power that mothers
have. This lack of power may extend to families with chil-
dren and those who work to support them. One practitioner
commented that
there are some women who have social expectations which are
well above what the society can let them have.
When discussing mothers in ethnic communities, one
practitioner spoke of the lack of power that mothers may
have in relation to themselves and their baby.
and lots them they don't have the individual strengths to stand
for what they want or they don't know how to form their own
judgement--what is best for their child or they even have the
power. But lots of them . . . they don't have the power to say that
is what I want for my child.
The "loss of power" is also implicit in comments about
career women who were high achievers with high expecta-
tions when they were working
suddenly with a baby and things are crashing in on top of them
and it is not going the way they want. They don't have the social
support [and] they don't know the people in the neighbourhood
. . . I guess they lock themselves in to a mental state where they
need some help.
The loss of control may therefore be also associated with
a loss, or absence of power. We will explore the possible role
of power below.
Support and nurturing. Support of mothers was identified in
the earlier analysis as a strong emerging protective theme.
That analysis drew on the findings of not only the interviews
and focus groups but also systematic reviews of perinatal
depression literature and the exploratory data analysis. The
social world/arena maps highlight the potential breadth of
this support within neighborhood and home environments.
The term nurturing was previously used to describe the care
of the infant. The concept of nurturing can be broadened to
encompass the care and protection of the mother and family
unit. The situational analysis map was silent on a discursive
element related to nurturing families. We will revisit the con-
cept of nurturing below.
Neighborhood and Macro-Arena Analysis
Table 2 focuses this analysis on the mother's neighborhood and
macro-arenas. The neighborhood and macro-arena situational
analysis mapping and analysis of relations identified the fol-
lowing concepts: (a) Social support networks, social cohesion,
and social capital; (b) services planning and delivery and social
policy; and (c) global economy, business, and media. As previ-
ously mentioned, the findings of situational analysis were then
used to inform the building of the social worlds/arenas map.
Figure 3 is the social worlds and social arenas map of
mothers' neighborhood and macro-arenas. What is this map
telling us? First, there is the domestic or home social arena
that was explored above. That arena remains central to this
analysis and is made up of few actors: mother, baby, father,
and others such as mothers' sister, mother, midwife, visiting
nurse, and friends. The home is the domain where mother
and baby spend most of the day. It is important to again note
that there may be expectations, loss of control, loneliness,
and poor connection to support. The immediate neighbor-
hood arena was also discussed in above. It is here that physi-
cal and local social aspects of the environment may impact
on mothers. There may be mothers' groups, buses, and ser-
vices available but for some these are absent. The neighbor-
hood may feel unsafe or friendly and this may affect mothers'
willingness to leave the home.
The Map illustrates two other possible neighborhood are-
nas. One of these has a "nice" local village, library, commu-
nity hall, and nice-looking homes and physical environments.
There is no comment about ethnicity because most people
are "Aussie." The other neighborhood arena has mixed eth-
nic peoples and is known as a "drug capital" with high levels
of crime, distrust, and perceived lack of safety. Those neigh-
borhoods are polarized images of suburbs in South West
Sydney.
The expert arena has universities that historically have
been physically distant from the community although their
experts worked closely with the neighborhood arenas. The
expert arena is closely overlapped with the policy and services
and social cohesion arenas. These are two areas where univer-
sities have been active. Big expert hospitals are in the expert
arena with maternity services closely associated. Antenatal
classes are close to the hospitals while mothers' groups are
imbedded in local neighborhoods. The expert voice is strong,
and South West Sydney has a history of providing expert lead-
ership in innovative services and programs.
The Mall plays an important role in the lives of all who
live and work in the city and community arena. The Mall is
designed for cars and may not always be mother and baby
friendly. The Mall is associated with "big business," media,
glamour, and expectations of what might be. The Mall has
replaced the Town Centre as the place to go to meet friends
and "hang out." Absent from the Community Arena are
"community gardens" and league teams. There are, however,
League Clubs and fast food outlets. Football teams are
emerging. The community has a poor bus and train service
making it difficult for mothers to get to The Mall. Important
in this arena are jobs. South West Sydney jobs are vulnerable
to changes in global economic fortunes.
Dominant is the policy and services arena. Previous anal-
ysis (Eastwood, Kemp, & Jalaludin, 2016) highlighted the
importance of access to services and the important role that
supportive government policy plays. South West Sydney has
large public housing estates and relatively poor access to ser-
vices. Services are not equitably distributed or delivered as
evident in a visualization of access to nursing services
Eastwood et al. 9
(Eastwood, 2011). GP services are described as a "cottage"
industry in many disadvantaged neighborhoods. There are
few mothers' groups, and most antenatal classes are held at
the hospitals. Federal and State policy plays an important
role in the lives of the families in South West Sydney where
the term "battlers" is used to describe the daily struggle of
families.
Global and local economics play a powerful role in the
lives of families. As illustrated in earlier media, advertise-
ments raise expectations for families a similar phenomenon
to the impact that The Mall may have on some families.
There are stark differences in wealth not only between North
and South West Sydney but also within local communities.
Parts of South West Sydney were settled by the Gentry of
New South Wales and that history still divides the region.
The power of Big Business to shape lives was illustrated in
the voices of local practitioners and mothers. The loss of
local League teams and community gardens are two
examples.
The neighborhood and macro-arena social worlds/arenas
map is traversed by the Social Cohesion Arena. Social cohe-
sion and its related concepts of social networks and social
capital have a positive influence on families and maternal
depression. The voices of mothers, practitioners, and our
quantitative analysis (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, &
Barnett, 2012; Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp, Phung, Barnett,
& Tobin, 2012), all suggest the protective influence of sup-
port and social integration. Global forces are increasing the
migration of peoples of different ethnic and cultural back-
grounds to South West Sydney. The diversity of peoples is a
feature of most South West Sydney suburbs. Previous quan-
titative studies have found that postnatal depression is asso-
ciated with mothers not being found in Australia and the
spatial studies indicated that rates of depression are higher in
suburbs with ethnic segregation (Eastwood, Jalaludin, Kemp,
Phung, & Barnett, 2013).
Social support networks, social cohesion, and social capital.Sup-
port and nurturing of mothers was identified as a strong
emerging protective theme. That analysis also identified that
family, services, policy, and support networks all played a
role in providing a nurturing environment. The above con-
firmed the importance of community-level social support
networks, social capital and ethnic integration. All of these
concepts point toward the role of connectedness or social
cohesion as being protective of mothers.
The situational analysis confirmed these findings and sug-
gested that current matters of ethnic segregation, diversity, and
integration were part of a broader idea of social cohesion.
Important historical elements were identified in South West

Sydney related to the phases of settlement and identity. Silent in
the data is the historical settlement of Macarthur by land owning
gentry and the role that the Nepean River played in dividing
social Class. In contrast to the close nit Macarthur communities,
other parts of the region have large migrant communities and
new public and private housing estates with varying degrees of
social cohesion and social capital. The situational analysis sug-
gests that both economic and policy forces play an important
role in shaping the level of social support available to mothers.
Services planning and delivery and social policy. Initial focused
coding identified group-level access to services and support-
ive social policy as key concepts in protecting mothers from
postnatal depression. The situational analysis confirmed
their important role and suggests that they are linked. The
division between them probably related to the hierarchical
nature of policy and service delivery in the Australian con-
text. The mothers were clear that income support, nurse
phone calls, and mothers' groups all contributed to support-
ing them when they felt "out of control" or depressed.
Although practitioners had clearly played an important role
in the region, their contribution was silent in the data. Draw-
ing on our own knowledge and experience, we placed the
expert arena between influencing policy and service delivery
and strengthening social cohesion.
Global economy, business, and media. Finally, it is clear from the
data that the influence of the global economy, big business, and
media reaches through all levels of the Social Arenas to impact
significantly on the situation for mothers and infants. Related are
earlier findings that included "being broke," economic marginal-
ization, occupational class, absence of power and control, and
the generation of expectations and dreams. Strong global eco-
nomic forces are also responsible for movement of migrants and
refugees to the region of South West Sydney, Sydney, Australia.
Some are economic migrants while others are from past and
present conflicts. Local jobs are vulnerable to global economic
fortunes, and the landscape of local communities are influenced
as much by the planning decisions of Big Business as they are by
planners and policy makers. Thus, local communities have peo-
ples who once fought each other living side by side.
The "Huggies" comment by one mother drew attention to
the important role played by media and advertising in the ordi-
nary lives of mothers. The role that media might play in raising
the expectations of mothers was previously discussed. Related
are the pressures put on families by images of large five-bed-
room homes (McMansions), four-by-four wagons to drop the
kids off at school, and the glitter of advertising and merchandise
in "The Mall." Our earlier analysis also included the comment
on the impact to the local community of losing the local League
team as a result of a media-related franchise agreement.
Discussion
Psychological stress has long been recognized as certain
cause of depression (Avison, Aneshensel, Schieman, &
Wheaton, 2010; Brown & Harris, 1978; Kinderman, 2005;
Stone, Lin, & Quartermain, 2008). The role of explanatory
research is to identify the, often unobserved, mechanisms
that trigger or maintain the experienced phenomenon.
Emerging from our home and neighborhood situational anal-
ysis are two central mechanisms:
Lost Expectations
Being alone. Buried in the voices of the mothers were stories
of "being alone" with the crying infant, with an absent part-
ner, mother or other support friend. Sometimes mothers
spoke of not being able to get out to see their friends. The
descriptions were powerful and suggested that this situation
is experienced by many mothers. We agree, therefore, with
Beck (1992, 1993, 2002) that depressed mothers experience
an "incongruity between expectations and the reality of
motherhood," a sense of pervasive loss, and loneliness.
The centrality of these two themes is further supported by
the neighborhood and macro-arena situational analysis
where powerful economic and media forces had further iso-
lated mothers and families in neighborhoods that were eco-
nomically disadvantaged with crime, violence, poor
transport, and either ethnically segregated or isolating for
minorities. The Mall was associated with "big business,"
media, glamour, and expectations of what might be.
One hallmark of critical realist analysis is the ontological
assumption that reality consists of hierarchically ordered lev-
els where a lower level creates the conditions for a higher
level (Danermark & Gellerstedt, 2004). The stratified realist
ontology is not, however, in conflict with Clarke's (2005)
view that "everything in the situation both constitutes and
affects most everything else in the situation in some way."
Danermark and Gellerstedt (2004) argue that "in reality lev-
els are entwined and [the] mechanisms could be supporting
each other or counteracting each other, and the outcome in a
specific context is the result of a very complex interplay
between levels and mechanisms." Possible structures, mech-
anisms, contexts, and outcomes are shown below based on
the findings from the Situational Analysis and Emergent
Theory Generation presented here (Table 3).
The findings of this analysis will contribute to the mixed
method theory generation undertaken for the Emergent Phase
of the main study. The subsequent Theory Construction
Phase undertook abductive triangulation of this and other
studies to construct a conceptual framework, theory, and
model (Eastwood et al., 2016).
Limitations and Strengths
Mothers were interviewed at a mothers'group. Consequently,
those mothers had experience of support from a mothers'
group. They placed strong importance on the importance of
the groups for establishing and maintaining support networks.
One mother noted that support networks may include family,
friends, and neighbors. The mothers who attended the groups
Eastwood et al. 11
were not themselves from socially disadvantaged back-
grounds, and few mothers were from non-English speaking
backgrounds. The number of mothers' groups interviewed
was limited in this study to three which may limit generaliz-
ability. Despite these limitations, the qualitative data were
rich and contributed significantly to both theory generation
and later theory construction. It was notable that the findings
from this qualitative study are similar to those found by Beck
in both her original phenomenological (Beck, 1992) and
grounded theory (Beck, 1993) studies and her later meta-syn-
thesis (Beck, 2002). Here, however, we have contextualized
the findings within broader social structures and contexts.
The qualitative methods used in this realist situational anal-
ysis included interviews and focus groups with qualitative
analysis. The strength of these approaches is their ability to
provide explanatory power to the analysis (Sayer, 2000) and
thus the identification of causal mechanisms. Sayer notes,
however, that the "concrete patterns and contingent relations
[identified] are unlikely to be `representative', `average,' or
`generalizable'."Assessment of the quality of qualitative stud-
ies is assessed using criteria that differ from those used for
extensive quantitative studies (Cohen & Crabtree, 2008;
Greenhalgh & Taylor, 1997; Kitto, Chesters, & Grbich, 2008;
Miyata & Kai, 2009). The criteria proposed by Kitto and col-
leagues were used to assess the quality of the current study.
The procedural rigor was made explicit through clear articula-
tion of the ontological and epistemology position informing
the study which then informed the emergent and explanatory
study design, methods of data collection and analysis. The
sampling techniques used were purposeful and sought to
include subjects from different communities, and ethnic back-
grounds. Reflexivity was maintained by acknowledging our
theoretical perspectives, values, and prior knowledge. Distance
from the subjects was achieved by intentionally engaging a
research assistant to conduct the parent focus groups. We
sought to "bracket" our prior understanding, maximize the use
of open coding, and thus allow understanding of phenomena
to emerge from the voices of the informants (Creswell, 1998).
The use of qualitative methods for emergent theory build-
ing was suited to the aim and objectives of this study which
was to explain the mechanisms by which circumstances influ-
ence developmental and life course outcomes with a focus on
perinatal depression. Emergent theory building methods such
as those used here are also consistent with accepted critical
realist methodologies (i.e., grounded theory). We were not
able to identify where situation analysis had been previously
used for critical realist theory building but, as a symbolic inter-
actionist methodology, its use within a critical realist episte-
mology is appropriate (Maxwell, 2012, p. 10).
Conclusion
We presented here the findings of a realist multilevel situ-
ational analysis of maternal depression. The analysis
moved from an emergent empirical approach toward the
more reflexive and abductive approach of situational anal-
ysis, thus better informing our abductive reasoning and
the generation of theory. Critical realism and symbolic
interactionism provided the methodological underpinning
for the study. We undertook a qualitative study of three
mothers' groups and eight practitioners. Interviews of
mothers and practitioners were analyzed using open cod-
ing to enable maximum emergence. Situational analysis
was then undertaken using situational and social worlds/
arena maps.
The theoretical concepts identified included (a) expecta-
tions and dreams; (b) marginalization and being alone; (c)
loss or absence of power and control; (d) support and nurtur-
ing (e) social support networks, social cohesion, and social
capital; (f) services planning and delivery and social policy;
and (g) global economy, business, and media.
Emerging was the centrality of being alone and expecta-
tions lost as possible triggers of stress and depression within
circumstances where media portrays expectations of mother-
hood that are shattered by reality and social marginalization.
We further observe that powerful global economic and politi-
cal forces are having an impact on the local situations. The
challenge for policy and practice is to support mothers and
their families within this adverse regional and global eco-
nomic context.
