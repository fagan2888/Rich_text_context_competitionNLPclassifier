Introduction
The capabilities, perceptions, and self-efficacy of educators
greatly affect the quality of immigrant children's integration
into their receiving society.As the first professional-educational
figures to encounter the children upon their arrival, preschool
teachers play an important role in receiving immigrant children.
These teachers are influential in determining their immigrant
students' future attitudes to learning, to the educational system,
and to society as a whole, as well as in building the children's
self-identity and self-esteem and in creating a trusting relation-
ship between the school system and immigrant families.
Preschool teachers in Israel are in a unique position because
their classes are physically and structurally distinct from the
primary school system. They work in autonomous profes-
sional units, each consisting of the teacher, a semi-professional
assistant, and up to 35 children per class. Like other teachers,
they have been found to suffer from overwork, but particularly
kindergarten teachers in Israel are the unmet needs of support,
sharing, and professional recognition. This situation has cre-
ated the simultaneous experience of loneliness on one hand,
and satisfaction with their autonomy and status within their
own professional world on the other (Firstater, 2012). In this
study, we explore the question of what can be learned from the
teachers' experiences of working with Ethiopian children in
kindergarten.
Kindergarten teachers' perceptions, experiences, and pro-
fessional knowledge have implications for their work with chil-
dren of Ethiopian origin. Analyzing the kindergarten teachers'
stories enabled an examination of how they perceived the
beliefs and social norms of Ethiopian society, how the teachers
related to the immigrants' values, and how they coped with
educating immigrant children from a different culture.

The Experiences of Israeli Early Childhood
Educators Working With Children of
Ethiopian Background
Esther Firstater1, Laura I. Sigad2, and Tanya Frankel1
Abstract
This study offers an in-depth examination of the experiences of early childhood educators, focusing on their work with
Ethiopian immigrant children and their families. We aim to describe and analyze the teachers' insider views vis-à-vis the
challenges faced by these children and their parents in the Israeli preschool system. Using narrative methodology, the
analysis of findings is based upon 20 stories written by 10 early childhood educators. It reveals that for these teachers,
the chief struggle is their relationship with the parents of their Ethiopian pupils, one characterized by difficulties, frustrations,
and burdens. The engagement with parents of Ethiopian children exhibited a range of possibilities: from the expression of
patronizing, hierarchical viewpoints, to a search for ad hoc ways of coping with a persistent cultural gap, to the attainment
of genuine, successful partnerships. Lack of sufficient knowledge and understanding of the unique cultural attributes of
the Ethiopian community appears to be the basis for the teachers' view of the parents as lacking faith in them and in the
educational system as a whole. In addition, suggestions are made about implications for educational practice and for policies
that might assist teachers in ameliorating these challenges via the development of, and professional training in, skills which
help coping with the problems and dilemmas unique to the multicultural classroom.

engage in self-criticism and to show empathy toward minority
groups and children of different ethnic and cultural back-
grounds, to interact with immigrant children and their fami-
lies, to legitimize the minority language in the classroom, to
acknowledge the existence of different cultures, and to develop
positive attitudes among the other students and teaching staff
toward the students from the minority group (Cho & DeCastro-
Ambrosetti, 2005; Lee & Dallman, 2008). When relations
between teachers and children from different ethno-cultural
backgrounds lack cultural sensitivity, conflicts and significant
misunderstandings can result. These problems may prevent
the children from receiving effective developmental support
that does not pressure them to disregarding their cultural iden-
tities and does not diminish their pride in their cultures of ori-
gin (Han & Thomas, 2010; Irvine, 2003; Kemple, 2004).
Notwithstanding the empathy educators express toward such
children in conjunction with listing all the challenges involved,
the teachers are also often critical toward the children's cul-
tural worlds, perceiving these cultures as factors that hinder
the students' achievement levels and affect their attitudes to
learning. Joshi, Eberly, and Konzal (2005) have examined
teachers' levels of understanding of the cultures of their stu-
dents' families and the implications of this understanding for
the teachers' attitudes toward the parents. Although on the
conceptual level the teachers appreciate the importance of the
culture and its influences on the children, these educators are
not adequately equipped to translate this understanding into
practice, instead emphasizing only external aspects of the cul-
ture such as food, clothing, celebrations, and stories.
The rapid increase in immigration rates of people with
different ethnic origins in the Western world and the subse-
quent demand that teachers develop culturally sensitive
learning programs are usually not supported with appropriate
training to provide mainstream education for children from
varied backgrounds (Santoro, 2009). In Israeli culture, it is
difficult to implement the multicultural approach, to change
teaching methods and educational programs, and to recog-
nize and integrate the children's cultural backgrounds (Geldi,
2009). To this end, training is required for culturally respon-
sive teaching (Han & Thomas, 2010), including increasing
awareness and sensitivity to intercultural differences as well
as multicultural knowledge about the values, worldviews,
and norms of both the teachers and children. Also necessary
is the development of relevant proficiencies, such as the abil-
ity to establish a "skilled dialogue" in the relationship
between children and their families from different cultural
backgrounds (Barrera & Corso, 2002). Increasing parents'
trust and sense of belonging can lead to the development of
an environment that respects cultural differences and invites
all students to accept and explore new, unfamiliar cultures
(Purnell, Ali, Begum, & Carter, 2007); other positive results
include the creation of communication channels that will
remain permanently open (Jones, 2010).
Early childhood is an especially suitable stage at which to
begin educating toward multiculturalism. At this young age,
through appropriate mediation, racist attitudes can be
changed and prejudices reduced (Ogletree & Larke, 2010).
This goal can be achieved by designing a learning environ-
ment that reflects the values of its students, adapting learning
programs, and giving children the opportunity to present and
describe their society's customs with pride (Chavkin, 2005).
Educators Working With Families From Diverse
Cultures
Working with preschool-age children in general--and from
differing cultural backgrounds in particular--demands the
development of a relationship with the pupil's family.
According to Bermúdez and Márquez (1996), the primary
communication barriers between teachers and parents from
different cultural backgrounds are related to differences in
language, education, and child-rearing methods. These barri-
ers are also related to the parents' troubled relationships with
the educational system, relationships characterized by unfa-
miliarity, bad experiences, and lack of understanding, lead-
ing to a lack of trust. These problems are exacerbated by
teachers' prejudices, lack of sensitivity, and sometimes even
blame directed toward the families for their supposed lack of
values and for not educating their children in accord with
what the teachers believe to be an appropriate manner
(DeCastro-Ambrosetti & Cho, 2005).
When the families of immigrant children are disconnected
from the kindergarten, the children become a vulnerable
group that does not receive a good educational foundation
prior to starting school, resulting in significant gaps from the
start of these students' school careers (Pelletier & Corter,
2005). The best way of involving parents from different cul-
tural backgrounds is to maintain open communication chan-
nels, to hold discussions in which parents and teachers can
become acquainted with each other's cultures, as well as to
organize activities in the classroom that respect multicultur-
alism and the principle of inclusion (Joshi et al., 2005).
Children from minority cultures have a much better
chance of academic success when the school builds partner-
ships with their families and learns about their values and
customs. This openness serves to create a safe learning envi-
ronment for minority groups and increases their sense of
belonging, which is crucial to success in the classroom
(Chavkin, 2005; Joshi et al., 2005; Purnell et al., 2007;
Wegmann & Bowen, 2010). Furthermore, Bermúdez and
Márquez (1996) have demonstrated that immigrant families
who are involved in their children's education are more suc-
cessful in helping them progress.
The Integration of Ethiopian Immigrants Into the
Israeli Educational System
Most Ethiopian Jews arrived in Israel in two large waves in the
1980s and 1990s, followed by a slow stream of immigration
up to the present day. By 2009, the Ethiopian population in
Firstater et al. 3
Israel numbered approximately 130,000 people (Leibel,
2009). Their absorption was made more difficult because of
their skin color, doubts about the authenticity of their
Jewishness, their low educational levels, broad cultural differ-
ences, their concentration in distressed neighborhoods, and the
limited opportunities available to them in employment. In
addition, Ethiopian immigrants were stigmatized as a "differ-
ent" and "problematic" community (Leibel, 2009; Shabtay,
2001). These difficulties resulted in psychological stress, a
sense of disappointment and affront, crises within the family,
and a sense of foreignness because of their skin color, which
hindered their acceptance as equals in Israeli society (Walsh &
Tuval-Mashiach, 2012).
The Ethiopian immigrants--who experienced a sudden
transition from a rural, agricultural culture to a Western,
industrialized society--were required to cope with a multi-
plicity of changes. Their consciousness of difference from
the rest of Israeli society was expressed in oppositional atti-
tudes toward figures of authority, the withholding of nega-
tive emotions, and avoidance of asking questions, making
requests, or taking initiative. Helplessness, confusion, mis-
understanding, the sense of a lack of control, and weakening
of mutual familial support were other expressions of the
challenges of cross-cultural adaptation (BenEzer, 1992).
These cultural changes and immigration difficulties
affected the children's absorption into the Israeli educa-
tional system. Typical of this process was their separation
from other students as a result of their high concentration
in distressed neighborhoods with weak educational institu-
tions. Ethiopian immigrant children therefore encountered
native Israeli students mainly from disadvantaged seg-
ments of society. Also endemic in the educational system
was the indiscriminate referral of Ethiopian children to
residential facilities, conveying the message of a lack of
trust in the parents' ability to educate them, as well as the
overreferral of these students to the special education sys-
tem (Mulat & Arcavi, 2009). Consequently, Ethiopian chil-
dren, who were already suffering from barriers and
stereotypes because of their skin color, were found to
underachieve at school and in higher education and to have
a high rate of drop-out, dissociation, and delinquency
(Goldblatt & Rosenblum, 2011).
Geiger (2012) found that, according to the children's
accounts, teachers had negative attitudes toward them. In a
study in Israel in which 232 sixth-grade students were inter-
viewed about teachers' verbal violence, it was found that
teachers tended to target immigrants from Ethiopia in verbal
attacks, separate them from their classmates during games
and parties, hint at their low levels of culture and education,
and make insulting remarks about the parents' lack of educa-
tion and inability to help their children.
In kindergartens in Israel, difficulties in relations with
Ethiopian students have been found to be based upon the
absence of an atmosphere of mutual respect as well as an
inadequate understanding of Ethiopian cultural norms (Tzur
& Eshel, 2003). One of the repercussions of these inadequa-
cies has been the very slow development of trust in the edu-
cational system among the parents of Ethiopian students
(Geldi, 2009).
Certain steps have already been taken in Israeli society to
cope with these phenomena. They include the increased par-
ticipation of young, educated members of the Ethiopian
community in social and educational programs, the creation
of intercultural bridging and initiatives for promoting inclu-
sion in the educational system, and strengthening the involve-
ment and authority of Ethiopian parents (Sever, 2004).
Nevertheless, the issue of education in a multicultural soci-
ety poses a challenge of the highest degree at all levels of the
educational system, starting in preschool education and con-
tinuing through teacher training educational programs. The
attitudes and approaches of educators toward this population
are of vital significance to the future of these children.
Method
The aim of the present article is to provide an insider's view
of the ways in which kindergarten teachers in Israel perceive
their work with pupils of Ethiopian origin and their families.
Thenarrativemethodguidesourmethodology(Polkinghorne,
1995), giving us the opportunity to learn about lived experi-
ence through the practical and personal knowledge recounted
in teachers' written accounts (Bruner, 1987; Clandinin &
Connelly, 2000; Connelly & Clandinin, 1988; Lieblich,
Tuval-Mashiach, & Zilber, 1998).
Sample
Participants in the present study were selected by purposive
sampling (Patton, 2002). The data consisted of 20 narrative
stories told by 10 participating kindergarten teachers, who
had professional experience working with Ethiopian chil-
dren and their families. The choice of sample in qualitative
research is based on conceptual and theoretical decisions
guided by research aims. Purposive sampling allows access
to a multiplicity of perspectives. In the case at hand, the
selection criteria were kindergarten teachers who worked in
the North of Israel in low-income neighborhoods, where the
highest percentage of the Ethiopian community resides. The
participants were between 30 and 55 years of age, and their
work experience as kindergarten teachers ranged from 5 to
23 years.
These kindergarten teachers were prompted to write
down two separate stories about significant experiences
they had while teaching Ethiopian children. The stories
were to be written in an open manner, with the component
parts of beginning, middle, and end (Lieblich et al., 1998).
The research aims were described in full to the participants
who wrote their stories by hand in their places of work.
Pseudonyms have been used to protect the promised ano-
nymity of the participants.

Analysis
Data analysis included open coding to enable the identifica-
tion of units of meaning. A cross-case analysis followed in
which segments from each interview were condensed until
core themes emerged (Lincoln & Guba, 2005; Patton, 2002).
This process was completed by all three of the authors of this
study separately, and then compared to ensure interceder
reliability. The themes, which emerged from the analysis, are
differentiated from the prompt to write about significant
experiences with Ethiopian children. For example, the theme
"Patronizing stances toward parents: `They smile and say
yes, yes, and then continue in their own way'," is based on
several different accounts of the multiple ways that teachers
showed patronizing stances toward Ethiopian children and
their families. Our cross-case analysis revealed that all those
different perspectives fall under a unified spectrum. This
spectrum is the content of first theme. Three primary themes
emerged from the data and serve as the backbone of our
analysis.
Trustworthiness
In the present article, credibility is established through the
systematic presentation of written stories and their analyses,
a format that allows the reader to evaluate the ways in which
reality was constructed and themes were derived (Maxwell,
2005). In qualitative research, the emphasis shifts from
validity to validation. Rather than presenting a finished prod-
uct, researchers describe the process by which they arrived at
the specific constructions underlying the study, and thus
allow readers to make their own judgments and to validate or
reject the interpretations suggested (Angen, 2000; Patton,
2002). For example, the theme "They don't play by our
rules" is presented in the following manner: First, contextual
information regarding the particular research participant is
offered, followed by a segment of the narrative itself.
Afterward, the analysis of the story component is presented,
including the context, the structure, and its relationship to the
unified theme as well as to the subsequent written account.
This detailed process is accessible to the reader in the presen-
tation of findings, and as such serves as a validation tool for
the researcher's systematic work. The focus of such research
is on in-depth, subjective analysis of experiences rather than
on generalizations. That being said, such an analysis also
provides a solid foundation for building a heuristic model on
which studies aimed at rigorous generalizations can be based
(Babbie, 2004).
Data Presentation and Analysis
Emergent Themes
The primary theme that arose from the analysis of the data
was the importance of the teachers' interactions with the
Ethiopian pupils' parents. All of the written narratives
centered solely on the teachers' perceptions, relationships,
and experiences with the children's parents, rather than on
daily interactions with the pupils themselves. Teachers' per-
ceptions of Ethiopian immigrant parents ranged from a lack
of sensitivity toward these parents, to a desire to diminish
cultural variation, to acceptance and understanding of such
differences. This continuum included three primary types:
(a) a patronizing stance toward parents, (b) a missionary
approach that paternalistically aimed at assimilating immi-
grants, and (c) an open attitude toward learning from cross-
cultural encounters and toward establishing mutual
partnerships with parents. The written narratives selected
and analyzed are representative illustrations of these types.
1. Patronizing stances toward parents: "They smile and
say yes, yes, and then continue in their own way."
Apatronizing stance proved to be a primary mode of relating to
Ethiopian parents. Teachers who adopted this stance tended to
exhibit negative judgments and to criticize the perceived physi-
cal neglect of these parents, for example, claiming that the chil-
dren lacked personal hygiene, wore inappropriate clothing for
size and weather conditions, consumed an unhealthy diet, and
failed to adhere to kindergarten timetables--tardiness being
especially problematic. The teachers' belief that they were in a
better position of knowing and understanding the best interests
of the child was often accompanied by frustration caused by the
parents' failure to accept the teacher's point of view and her
efforts to control the situation and improve the students'
situation.
Rivka describes her frustration when an Ethiopian father
refused to allow his son to be referred to a special education
center for remedial reinforcement. In the case at hand, the
mother of the boy was at the time institutionalized in a men-
tal health facility, and the boy was one of six children whom
the father solely cared for in the mother's absence. She
writes,
Last year, I had an Ethiopian child whose mother was in a
nuthouse [mental institution]. The children were cared for by the
father, and there was great neglect . . . The siblings would bring
the boy to the kindergarten, and sometimes no one bothered to
pick him up. The boy was bright, and it is clear that he had
potential, if there would have been any type of investment from
the home and good and positive relations towards him. I
approached the father and told him that his son needs professional
help. The father refused and said that I should not make his son
into a "crazy" because he is not! . . . The boy continued to walk
the streets in the afternoons, had behavioral problems, and
vented his aggression on other children. I pitied him so, but
despite everything that I tried to do to persuade the father,
nothing helped. I heard that now it still goes on, and the boy
receives no help.
Rivka's patronizing position is reflected in her conviction
and assumption that the core of the hardship of the Ethiopian
child is rooted solely in what she defines as a neglectful and
Firstater et al. 5
negative home. She is the one who knows what is best for the
child and is slighted that her efforts for intervention are not
realized. Ironically, while she declares her sense of pity and
concern for the boy, it is she whose professional integrity is
challenged, and thus she becomes the center of the tale.
While she believes strongly in her own professional fore-
sight and even backs this up by offering proof of what hap-
pens subsequently, her particular solution for the child is
externalized as she recommends outside intervention, rather
than attempting to remedy the situation within her own kin-
dergarten. She reveals little, if any sensitivity, to the fact that
this external, professional recommendation has particularly
negative connotations in the unique family situation of the
father, nor does she express sympathy for the emotional and
logistical struggles of a father parenting six children on his
own. The teacher knows best; her advice is ignored; and the
prophecy is not prevented. Not only is a child "lost," but
when the "right" help is not accepted, Rivka bears the emo-
tional costs of professional disrespect.
Similarly, Hannah conveys her sense of insult that the
norms of her classroom management in the kindergarten are
not respected by an Ethiopian mother. The mother works
nights and consistently brings her daughter late, insisting
upon entering the kindergarten to see what is going on:
When a mother brought her child late [to kindergarten], I went
out to the gate and asked her to say goodbye to her daughter
outside, like every other parent who comes late. She liked to
come into the kindergarten and see what we were doing. No
matter how much I tried to explain to her, I didn't succeed,
and the mother insisted that she must go inside, and I didn't
agree. The mother told the girl that they were leaving and
would never come back to the kindergarten. She took a step
back, stopped, and said, "If we were Israelis, you wouldn't
speak to me that way; it's only because we are Ethiopian." I
was insulted and hurt.
Hannah's working style expresses a strong need for order
and control; the norms and codes of the kindergarten offer an
important and needed structure for daily routines. Hannah
therefore takes matters into her own hands and physically
stops the mother at the gate. Setting boundaries, in her eyes,
takes precedence over efforts toward interpersonal commu-
nication. The desire of the mother to enter the kindergarten is
seen only as a disruption of codes and order, and the possibil-
ity that positive outcomes could come from such an interac-
tion is not considered. The communication style used by
Hannah leaves the mother feeling marginalized both physi-
cally and emotionally, and this in turn evokes the sense that
her foreignness is at the root of the insult she experiences.
The teacher's patronizing stance is revealed in bottom-down
communication, both verbal and physical, clearly stating that
it is the teacher who defines the sole accepted order and way
of being in the kindergarten. Uncharacteristically for this
immigrant group, the mother outwardly articulates her expe-
rience of discrimination. Despite the fact that the mother
directly communicates her feelings of insult, as in Rivka's
narrative, it is the teachers' experience of insult and hurt that
is placed at the center of the narrative.
As we have shown, these kindergarten teachers are
ambivalent as to how to relate to Ethiopian children and their
families. The teachers' narratives alternate between the wish
to include Ethiopian immigrants and the need to assert their
professional authority. The emotional response to what they
perceive as a lack of cooperation is a painful sense of rejec-
tion. It appears that they are willing to accept Ethiopian fami-
lies, provided that the parents unquestioningly accept their
authority. As one of the teachers wrote, "They smile and say
yes, yes. And then continue in their own way."
2. The missionary approach: "Even though I present it
as a free gift that will truly help the child."
The teachers in our study expressed a strong and genuine
desire to assist Ethiopian children and their families to accli-
mate and become integrated into Israeli society and culture.
However, by analyzing the written narratives of the partici-
pating teachers, it becomes apparent that they sometimes
adopt an assimilationist approach toward this aim. While
their aim is to help, they define help as teaching and educat-
ing the immigrants to conform to the norms of the majority.
This entails celebrating holidays and birthdays in the "cus-
tomary" way, adhering to a particular diet, and accepting
Israeli parenting norms. Although the teachers display a
strong altruistic desire to help, this help is coupled with a
very clear message that there is one correct way to be Israeli.
Clara relates to her efforts to educate and socialize the
kindergarten parents on dietary matters, explaining her frus-
tration when the Ethiopian parents do not follow suit. She
writes,
I see improvements with most of the kindergarten parents as a
result of my advice and guidance. It is only the Ethiopians who
continue to send their children food without paying attention to
my guidelines to provide variety. They send sweet things, and
sweet drinks; this is despite the fact that I prohibit it.
Clara is the one in control and believes that her authority is
for the ultimate benefit of all. She feels slighted that despite
her pure and good intentions to create what she sees as posi-
tive health changes for the children, her advice is ignored,
and she emphasizes that it is solely the Ethiopian parents
who refuse to follow her important instructions. By seeing
them as under her control, she infantilizes them, failing to
fully recognize the parents' own agency.
Shoshana is an experienced kindergarten teacher. She
explains in her written narrative the ways in which she is
challenged by the refusal of a parent to follow her profes-
sional advice, in this case the referral of an Ethiopian child to
an inclusive education committee for him to receive addi-
tional remedial teaching with a specialist.
6 SAGE Open
I've been working with this population for 10 years already, and
it is still hard for me to accept the reactions. Where does this
resistance to receiving help come from? Even though I present it
as a free gift that will truly help the child's progress. After that
incident, I felt frustrated and unprofessional since I wasn't able
to convince the parent when I saw how badly the boy needed
help. When I asked that the parents come to the Inclusive
Education Committee, so that the boy could receive professional
help, they refused to cooperate. Even at the expense that he
would not receive the help that he needs.
Shoshanna bears the burden of her inability to actualize her
desire to help an Ethiopian child. However, she does not
place the locus of blame on herself, but rather on the parents,
because of their refusal to accept assistance. Throughout her
10 years of experience with this population, she has consis-
tently found herself left on the sidelines, marginalized in her
efforts to enact what she perceives as a kind, well-intentioned
attempt to help. This is experienced as emotional hardship,
and she and the parents remain distinct and oppositional enti-
ties. An ever-present lack of mutual trust has not dissipated
despite long years of genuine effort and good intentions.
The missionary stance highlights the cultural gap between
the teachers and the parents. We see from this pattern that in
adapting an assimilationist approach to the integration of
these children, the teachers themselves wind up feeling bur-
dened with frustration as well as a sense of hardship which
they are left to cope with on their own. The lack of mutual
trust between teachers and parents is characteristic of the
missionary approach.
3. Learning from cross-cultural encounters: "It was like
rain on a summer's day."
A third approach which emerged from the data reflects an
attitude of cultural sensitivity. Through experience-based
practice, accompanied by emotional connections to the par-
ents, teachers learn to find solutions to challenges as they
arise. Rina writes of the preparations for the Chanukah cele-
bration in the kindergarten, an occasion which she decides to
use as an opportunity for multicultural inclusion. Her idea is
that the Chanukah prayer should be recited by the parents,
not only in Hebrew, as is customary, but also in the other two
spoken languages of the parents:
The incident happened at Chanukah. It was my first year in the
kindergarten, and I wanted to bring people together, to join
hearts, and bring things together through something that unites
all Israelis. At the Chanukah party, I decided that the blessing for
lighting the Chanukah candles would be said in three languages:
Hebrew, Russian, andAmharic (the Ethiopians'native language).
I asked the Ethiopian parents [at the Chanukah party] to
participate, and nearly everyone refused. I was shocked and I
couldn't understand it, since it was such a nice gesture on my
part. But I didn't give up and I called an "educational bridger" of
Amharic, and she explained to me that most of the Ethiopian
parents do not know how to read or write. I was even more
surprised, and I didn't know what to do, and the educational
bridger said that she would help me and would write the blessing
in Amharic and would also find out which of the parents do
know how to read. In the end of the day, we found a father who
said the blessing in Amharic. In that moment, I looked at the
Ethiopian parents and saw pride and happiness on their faces;
their faces glowed with joy. Even though afterwards no one told
me how important it was to them to hear their language and to
relate to their culture. In those moments, I felt great happiness
overcome me and felt that I had done something holy and very
important.
Rina, like the other teachers presented previously, also feels
disappointed and frustrated when perceived good intentions
cannot be actualized. However, unlike the two previous types
discussed above, she does not remain paralyzed by bad feel-
ings. She takes action, utilizing the resources available to her
by turning to the appropriate person for advice, and thus cre-
ates an opportunity to resolve the misunderstanding.
The integrationist approach fosters a process of cultural
understanding and cooperation which mutually benefits both
the parents and the teachers themselves. While the teacher
begins her account with feelings of frustration and shock, she
prides herself on overcoming challenges and making a con-
tribution to the community. Such a contribution is so fulfill-
ing to her that she is able to cope without the explicit gratitude
of the parents and enjoys a sense of pride.
Teachers who embrace such an approach not only learn to
cope with challenges as they arise, but grow professionally
from these experiences. Esther describes such an encounter:
I write messages to the parents via the children, to provide
challenges for the children. I noticed that whenever I gave such
a note to a particular Ethiopian boy, who was very bright, that he
would throw the note on the floor or in the trash bin on his way
out of the classroom. I was shocked the first time it happened. I
couldn't understand why he would do such a thing, and since he
avoided my question, I came to the conclusion that the boy has
a behavioral problem. I called the educational bridger who
speaks Amharic, to speak to his parents and clarify the issue.
One day, during a conversation with the boy, I asked him again
about the note. I was amazed by his answer; it was like rain on a
summer day for me; I did not expect such a reaction from the
child. When he spoke he had anger in his voice: "They don't
read anyway!" I saw the frustration and disappointment on his
face, and since then, whenever I send a note home, I read it
aloud. I tell the children that they are grown up and that they also
need to know what is written in the message. I succeeded in that
the boy no longer throws the notes away, and he has become
responsible in telling his parents the message. (uses Hebrew
proverb: "I have learned more than all my teachers before me.")
The teacher combines empathy and creativity to generate an
approach which reflects her educational awareness and sen-
sitivity toward cultural differences, and which allows her to
fulfill her desire to include Ethiopian children and their par-
ents in the educational process.

Teachers thus have the ability to connect to their own
emotions and use them as tools to learn and grow, creating a
norm of cultural sensitivity in the classroom. When this pro-
cess occurs, it is empowering; problems can be overcome,
and the benefits are manifold.
The kindergarten teachers who participated in our study
provided an insider perspective on the challenges and
rewards of working with Ethiopian children, while focusing
on the difficulties in relating to their families. Despite differ-
ent attitudes ranging from patronizing to missionary, and
finally an openness to discovering methods of cultural inte-
gration, the educators were all united by their impassioned
reactions and emotional involvement.
Discussion
In our era of ever increasing globalization, educators are
coping with the needs, challenges, and benefits of immigrant
students from diverse cultural backgrounds (Suárez-Orozco
& Qin-Hilliard, 2004). The educator­parent relationship is
one of the keys to successful integration of both the pupils
and their family units within the educational setting.
The goal of the study at hand was to describe and analyze
the accounts of the kindergarten teachers who participated in
our study, depicting their challenges in working with
Ethiopian children. It should be noted that the majority of the
stories dealt with the characteristically frustrating nature of
the teachers' relationships with the children's parents.
The narratives that were described and analyzed focus
primarily on common day-to-day issues of the kindergarten,
such as referral for remedial intervention and coping with
tardiness. However, the kindergarten teachers often associate
these issues with the specific Ethiopian cultural origin of the
families. It may be that to some extent, the cognitive force of
prejudice plays a role in the tendency to assign negative sig-
nificance to anything that appears to deviate from the
expected norm. In this particular case, not only are the chil-
dren from an immigrant background, but they also represent
the only Jewish sub-community that is racially and culturally
African. However, it should be noted that educator­family
relationships in general are often fraught with conflict
(Lahman & Park, 2004), and the challenges described by
Israeli kindergarten teachers are perhaps not unique to or
specifically related to Ethiopian culture.
The quantity and intensity of emotion expressed in
response to coping with immigrant-parental challenges is
one of the main findings of the study. This element appears
to connect the diverse patterns of behavior and expressions
of the kindergarten teachers: Their strong emotional reac-
tions ranged from feeling a need to distance themselves from
the pupils, personal insult, anger, frustration, embarrassment,
helplessness, and guilt to feelings of professional satisfac-
tion, pride, and intense empathy. The intensity of the teach-
ers' feelings may be proportional to the severity of the
problems as they perceive them. Moreover, the intensity of
such emotion offers the teachers an opportunity to confront
the experience of coping with otherness and the potential
threat of the other (Zembylas, 2010). It may be that the
"other" symbolizes the need for uncomfortable, uneasy
change and for reevaluating the way that one has become
accustomed to being in the world.
Foucault (1994) uses the term "ethics of discomfort" to
explain the potential empowerment that a state of emo-
tional discomfort can ultimately induce. The ethics of dis-
comfort can and should be used as a tool among educators
to enable them to view negative feelings toward immi-
grant children, such as the Ethiopian children and their
families, not as a destructive, malevolent force, but rather
as problematic emotions to be approached and faced with-
out self-judgment.
The ethics of discomfort thus offers an opportunity for
teachers to explore their assumptions about themselves to
position themselves as witnesses to social injustice and not
merely as observers and to be able to see their situation from
different perspectives (Zembylas, 2010).
Furthermore, we find in our study that it is often the
intense emotional involvement of the teachers which empow-
ers them to undergo a process of positive change. Once our
participants are able to connect to their own emotional expe-
riences and feel empathy, they succeed in developing suc-
cessful and creative solutions that bridge cultural gaps and
give them a sense of great pride and satisfaction.
Recommendations for Teacher Education and
Development
Based on the findings of our study, teacher education should
be at the forefront of our efforts to improve the integration of
immigrant children and their families within educational and
cultural frameworks. It is early childhood educators who
most often serve as the initial, formal face of the receiving
society, and thus teachers have a particularly strong influ-
ence on the formation of the attitudes of the child and his
family toward schooling, learning, and society.
Teachers' emotions should be emphasized as the fulcrum
for changing attitudes, relations, and behaviors toward immi-
grant children. Such an approach should take priority over
knowledge-based cultural diversity programs because it is
empathy development which will serve as a chief force to
connect families to the educational setting and to prevent
marginalization. Thus, teachers should be exposed to the
concept of the ethics of discomfort as a means of initiating
reflection and personal transformation.
Furthermore, it is critical to enrich the understanding of
early childhood educators with regard to the processes of dis-
crimination and prejudice. Most significantly, it is important to
make them aware that such feelings are part of human nature
and should be evaluated holistically for both their potential
dangers and their potential benefits in triggering positive
change. This positive potential can be achieved not by
8 SAGE Open
suppressing any such negative emotion, but rather by being in
continual inner dialogue with these uncomfortable feelings.
The application of the aforementioned suggestions will
provide teachers with the tools necessary to improve the rela-
tionship between the teachers and the parents of Ethiopian
students, establishing a new foundation upon which to ame-
liorate the learning experience of the children from the very
beginning of their education in the Israeli school system.
