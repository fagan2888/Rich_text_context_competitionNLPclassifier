Introduction
Overweight and obesity are one of the world's most chal-
lenging public health problems (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2003).The prevalence of overweight has reached
epidemic proportions in most Western countries, including
Portugal (Carreira, Pereira, Azevedo, & Lunet, 2012).
Overweight and obesity rates are high among employed
adults and have shown a consistent increase over the past
few decades (Snijder, Visser, Dekker, & Seidell, 2004; van
Dam, Willet, Manson, & Hu, 2006). Overweight and obesity
are well documented to be associated with major chronic ill-
nesses, including hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, heart dis-
eases, cancer, and all cause mortality (Christensen et al.,
2011; Linde et al., 2012; van Dam et al., 2006). Excessive
body weight has also been shown to increase the risk for
musculoskeletal pain (Han, Schouten, Lean, & Seidell,
1997), sick leave, and early retirement from the workforce,
causing high socioeconomic costs (Christensen et al., 2011;
Tunceli & Williams, 2006; Verweij, Coffeng, van Mechelen,
& Proper, 2011;). Obesity is associated with negative conse-
quences in working populations, including more frequent
absenteeism, workplace injury and disability pension claims,
and higher health care costs (Linde et al., 2012).
It is also known that musculoskeletal disorders related to
work are a major cause of disability in working-age indi-
viduals (Christensen et al., 2011; Verweij, Proper, Weel,
Hulshof, & van Mechelen, 2009). Several studies have
linked obesity with musculoskeletal disorders and the repet-
itive work (Christensen et al., 2011; Miranda, Viikari-
Juntura, Martikainen, Takala, & Riihimäki, 2001; Tunceli &
Williams, 2006).
As employed adults spend approximately half their wak-
ing time at work, worksites provide a logical setting in which
the environment might be reshaped to promote healthier
behaviors and improve weight control. Employers may be
motivated to make changes due to concerns about quality or
cost of employee health care (Osilla, 2012), and worksites
may be in a unique position to develop resources and promote

and Musculoskeletal Pain and Related
Symptoms in Different Body Regions
Among Workers

Abstract
Obesity rates are high among employed adults and have shown a consistent increase over the past few decades. Musculoskeletal
disorders related to work are a major cause of disability in working individuals. The objective of this study was to verify the
associations between weight status and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in different body regions among workers.
The sample comprised 203 factory workers. Anthropometric measures were assessed with standardized protocols and body
mass index (BMI) was calculated. Participants were classified as nonoverweight (BMI  24.9 kg/m2) or overweight/obese (BMI
 25 kg/m2). Musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was assessed with the Nordic Questionnaire of Osteoarticular
Symptoms. The association of BMI and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was analyzed with logistic regression.
Overweight/obese participants were more likely to have musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in the shoulders (odds
ratio [OR] = 2.129, p = .023). Our results emphasize the need of worksite interventions to promote healthy weight as a way
to prevent musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms.

social support among coworkers for obesity preventive
behaviors (Samuel, Raleigh, Hower, & Schwartz, 2003).
Environmental changes that make conceptual sense for obe-
sity prevention include targeting food service (i.e., availabil-
ity of energy-dense foods, portion sizes, cost), the physical
environment (e.g., opportunities for exercise), and informa-
tion distributed to increase knowledge of behaviors related to
obesity risk (French, Story, & Jeffery, 2001; Hill, Wyatt,
Reed, & Peters, 2003).
According to public health perspective, effective well-
documented initiatives for reducing weight, improving phys-
ical capacity, and reducing musculoskeletal pain among
health care workers are therefore needed. Moreover, there is
lack of evidence about the association between weight status
and musculoskeletal injury in different body regions.
The aim of this study was to verify the associations
between weight status and musculoskeletal pain and related
symptoms in different body regions among workers.
Method
Study Design and Sampling
The present study derives from a larger research project on
Physical Activity at Worksite, which is aimed to decrease
physical disability, indicated by musculoskeletal disorders
and related symptoms; increase work ability; and decrease
sickness absence among workers with high physical work
demands.
This study was conducted from November 2010 to
September 2011, in a multinational manufacturing appli-
ances company with office in Portugal. These 11 months
included preliminary evaluation, selection of experimental
group (EG) and control group (CG), the intervention pro-
gram that lasts 6 months along with tests performed at base-
line and at the end of the intervention.
For the purpose of this study, we only use the baseline
data and limited the analysis to the variables under the scope
of this study.
This study began by carrying out several introductory
meetings about the project: the administration board, the
medical department, production department, human
resources department, as well as, the workers.
At the beginning of this intervention, 221 employees were
invited (93 men; 128 women) to participate, from those, 212
agreed to participate (88 men; 124 women) in baseline tests
and measures. The employees who did not participate did not
significantly differ from those who agreed to participate,
with regard to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI; p >
.05, for all). Some participants were not included in our anal-
ysis (n = 9) because their weight and height information was
missing. Therefore, the final sample comprised 203 partici-
pants (82 men; 121 women).
All the participants were full-time workers (40 hr/week)
and employed in the company for at least 6 months.
All participants in this study were informed of its goals
and provided written informed consent to participate. The
study was approved by the Faculty of Sport, University of
Porto Ethics Committee; it was conducted in accordance
with the World Medical Association's Helsinki Declaration
for Human Studies.
Anthropometry Measures
Body height was measured to the nearest millimeter in bare
or stocking feet with the participant standing upright against
a stadiometer (Holtain Ltd., Crymmych, Pembrokeshire,
United Kingdom). Weight was measured to the nearest 0.10
kg, lightly dressed using a portable electronic weight scale
(Tanita Inner Scan BC 532, Tokyo, Japan). BMI was calcu-
lated from the ratio between body weight (kg) and body
height (m2). Participants were categorized as nonoverweight,
overweight, and obese, applying the cutoff points suggested
by the WHO (2000).
Percentage of body fat (% BF) was estimated using a bio
impedance scale (Tanita Inner Scan BC 532, Tokyo, Japan),
which was set to "standard" for body frame, and the partici-
pant's age, height, and gender were entered.
Waist circumference was measured twice, with a nonelas-
tic metal anthropometric tape, midway between the lower rib
margin and the iliac crest at the end of normal expiration
(Lohman, Roche, & Martorell, 1988). The average of the two
measures was used for analysis. If the two measurements dif-
fered by more than 1 cm, a third measurement was taken and
the two closest measurements were averaged.
Sociodemographic Variables
Participants answered a questionnaire that assessed several
sociodemographic variables (age, marital status, etc.).
Participants were divided according to their job position in
factory, that is, "white-collars" (skilled occupations) and
"blue-collars" (unskilled and manual jobs).
Musculoskeletal Disorders
and Related Symptoms
Musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms were assessed
by Nordic Questionnaire of Musculoskeletal Disorders
(NMQ; Kuorinka et al., 1987), supplemented with questions
about localized pain intensity. This questionnaire has been
validated to the Portuguese population (Mesquita, Ribeiro, &
Moreira, 2010). The NMQ consists of 27 binary choice ques-
tions (yes or no). The questionnaire has three questions cor-
relating to nine anatomic regions (neck, shoulders, writs/
hands, lumbar region, dorsal region, hips/thighs, knees,
ankles/feet)--"had some troubles or pain in the last 12
months," "in the last 12 months felt some limitation caused
by work in the daily activities," and "had some troubles or
pain in the last 7 days." In the sense of facilitating the
Moreira-Silva et al. 3
identification of the corporal areas, the questionnaire also
includes a corporal diagram detaching all of the involved
corporal areas (Kuorinka et al., 1987). The pain intensity in
the "last 7 days" was included in the numeric pain scale
(range = 0-10).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive characteristics of the participants were presented
as means ± standard deviation and percentages. The
Kolmogorov­Smirnov test was used to assess the assump-
tion of normality. Two-tailed t test was performed to com-
pare groups for continuous variables and 2 test for
categorical variables. The association between weight status
and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was ana-
lyzed with logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, and
jobs position. Only the significant results of logistic regres-
sion models are presented. The data were analyzed for statis-
tical significance by using the statistical package of social
science (SPSS 20.0) software for Mac OXS. A p value below
.05 was denoted as significant.
Results
In the total sample (n = 203), 38.4% was classified as over-
weight and 22.2% as obese (Table 1). Overweight/obese par-
ticipants had higher proportion of "blue-collars" jobs
compared with nonoverweight participants (76.4% vs.
23.6%, respectively, p = .013). No significant differences for
age and proportion of gender were seen between weight
status.
As depicted in Table 2, the overweight/obese participants
reported more frequently musculoskeletal pain and related
symptoms in the shoulders (p = .007) and wrist/hand in the
last 12 months (p = .04) compared with their normal weight
counterparts.
Logistic regression analysis showed that overweight/
obese participants were more likely to have musculoskeletal
pain and related symptoms in the last 12 months in the shoul-
ders (odds ratio [OR] = 2.129, p = .041; Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, we found that overweight/obese participants
reported higher pain intensity only in shoulders and wrist/
hand compared with their lean counterparts. The results sug-
gested that overweight/obese participants were more likely
to have musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in the
last 12 months in the shoulders. This association was not
confounded by age, gender, and jobs position as it remained
significant after adjustments.
In this study, a higher proportion (60.6%) of overweight/
obesity was seen among workers. Likewise, a cross-sectional
study has found overweight/obesity prevalence above 60%
among Kuwait Oil Company workers (Al-Asi, 2003). Choi
et al, (2010) in a longitudinal study also showed that the
prevalence of overweight/obesity increased significantly
from 1995-2002 among factory workers. Moreover, over-
weight and obesity are more prevalent among blue-collar and
shift workers than among white-collar and office workers
(Karlsson, Knutsson, & Lindahl, 2001; Nakamura,
Nakamura, & Tanaka, 2000; Nakamura et al., 1997). In our
study, we also found a higher proportion of overweight/obe-
sity in blue-collar workers. Furthermore, obesity may repre-
sent an additional risk factor for diseases that result from
workplace exposures (Schulte et al., 2007). These findings
emphasize that efficient weight loss programs are highly rel-
evant as health promotion for this sector. Indeed, we find an
example in a Danish workplace health promotion study with
workers. The study consisted in promoting correct ergo-
nomic setup, frequent rest, stretching and strengthening
exercises and showed a reductionin a few degrees of the

and vegetable consumption. This participatory intervention
resulted in a modest improvement in health status and pos-
sible unmeasured secondary gains, such as improved morale
and increased productivity (Siegel, Prelip, Erausquin, &
Kim, 2010). Thus, some studies highlight the importance of
the reduction of body weight in sedentary works, to decrease
the risk to related musculoskeletal disorders and occupa-
tional-psychosocial stress, and improve life quality
(Christensen et al., 2011; Schulte et al., 2007).
In our study, we found a positive association between
BMI and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in last
12 months in the shoulder and in the wrist/hand. Several
studies observed a positive association between overweight/
obesity and increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders, sick-
ness absence, work disability, cardiovascular disease, and
mortality (Schmier, Jones, & Halpern, 2006). It has also been
described that obesity appears to have a significant positive
association with absenteeism (measured as work loss days;
Bungum, Satterwhite, Jackson, & Morrow, 2003; Schulte
et al., 2007). Sethi, Sandhu, and Imbanathan (2011), in 301
workers with different jobs and shifts in an engineering plant,
found a significant association (p < .001) between high BMI
and increased scores of musculoskeletal discomfort and
occupational stress. The authors of the latter study also
reported a higher incidence of overweight and obesity in
these workers compared with the national average for similar
age classes; therefore meetings were organized at the plant
on awareness and information on correct lifestyle and diet
targeted for shift workers. Bihari, Kesavachandran, Pangtey,
Srivastava, and Mathur (2011) also found in cross-sectional
study that the risk of musculoskeletal pain among over-
weight/obese individuals was 1.7-times more as compared
with nonoverweight participants.
Some limitations of the present study should be acknowl-
edged. As in every cross-sectional study, conclusions related
to cause and effect cannot be drawn. With the use of self-
reported musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms, one
cannot rule out some reporting bias; however, the question-
naire has been previously tested (Mesquita et al., 2010).
BMI may not be a sensitive measure of body fatness when
there are some sophisticated methods to accurately measure
body fat, such as magnetic resonance imagining or dual-
energy X-ray. However, such techniques are not feasible to
apply in work environment, because they are complex and
time-consuming. Thus, BMI has been widely used as an
index of relative adiposity among adults and in studies of
the impact of work on obesity.
Conclusion
In our study, we found that overweight/obesity is positively
associated with musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms
in shoulders among workers. This study provides the insight
to the health professionals about the relationship between
BMI and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms, to for-
mulate well-designed training program to avoid overweight.
