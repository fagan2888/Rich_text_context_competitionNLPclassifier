Abstract
Adding simulated viewpoint jitter or oscillation to displays enhances visually induced illusions of
self-motion (vection). The cause of this enhancement is yet to be fully understood. Here, we
conducted psychophysical experiments to investigate the effects of different types of simulated
oscillation on vertical vection. Observers viewed horizontally oscillating and nonoscillating optic
flow fields simulating downward self-motion through an aperture. The aperture was visually
simulated to be nearer to the observer and was stationary or oscillating in-phase or counter-
phase to the direction of background horizontal oscillations of optic flow. Results showed that
vection strength was modulated by the oscillation of the aperture relative to the background optic
flow. Vertical vection strength increased as the relative oscillatory horizontal motion between the
flow and the aperture increased. However, such increases in vection were only generated when
the added oscillations were orthogonal to the principal direction of the optic flow pattern, and not
when they occurred in the same direction. The oscillation effects observed in this investigation
could not be explained by motion adaptation or different (motion parallax based) effects on depth
perception. Instead, these results suggest that the oscillation advantage for vection depends on
relative visual motion.

Introduction
Optic flow is a visual stimulus generated by the motion of an observer relative to other objects
in the environment. The projection of optic flow on the retina is capable of inducing the
illusory experience of self-motion in completely stationary observers, known as vection
(Brandt, Dichgans & Koenig, 1973; see also Palmisano, Allison, Schira, & Barry, 2015 for
alternative definitions of this term). Researchers have used vection measurement as a
powerful tool to examine the perceptual mechanisms responsible for the experience of
physical self-motion. Although self-motion perception is multisensory in nature, vection
demonstrates that visual information alone is sufficient to generate the experience of self-
motion without other nonvisual self-motion senses (see Riecke, 2010 and Palmisano et al.,
2015 for reviews).
Early studies assumed that vection should be facilitated by minimizing any visual-
vestibular sensory conflicts about the physical nature of self-motion (Brandt, Dichgans, &
Bu
¨ chele, 1974; Melcher & Henn, 1981; Wong & Frost, 1981; Young, Dichgans, Murphy, &
Brandt, 1973; Zacharias & Young, 1981). According to this view, visual simulations of
constant velocity self-motion should induce optimal vection because the vestibular system
is specialized for detecting self-accelerations and cannot distinguish between constant
linear self-motion and remaining stationarity (Howard, 1986). Although vection appears to
be strengthened under many conditions where the expected visual-vestibular conflicts are
thought to be reduced (e.g., Melcher & Henn, 1981; Young et al., 1973), Palmisano and
coworkers have repeatedly shown that vection is increased (not reduced) by adding simulated
self-acceleration to constant velocity displays (see Palmisano, Allison, Kim, & Bonato, 2011
for a review). In the earliest of these studies, Palmisano, Gillam, and Blackburn (2000) found
that the vection in depth induced by radially expanding optic flow was strengthened by the
addition of visually simulated horizontal or vertical viewpoint jitter (similar to the effects of
camera shake). This jitter advantage for vection has been confirmed under a variety of
different stimulus settings (see Palmisano et al., 2011 for a review of this research).
The jitter advantage for vection has been found to be robust to changes in the amplitude,
frequency, and direction of the jitter. Adding horizontal, vertical, or even diagonal simulated
viewpoint jitter has very similar effects on the vection in depth induced by radial flow
(e.g.,Palmisano, Allison, & Pekin, 2008; Palmisano et al., 2000). This jitter advantage for
vection also does not appear to be due to cognitive factors, such as participant expectations
or instructional demands (see Palmisano & Chan, 2004). Whereas the early research was
conducted using visually simulated viewpoint jitter (random, broadband simulated head
perturbations), later research showed that vection could be improved in a similar fashion
by adding visually simulated viewpoint oscillation (periodic simulated head perturbations) to
the radial optic flow (i.e., the oscillation advantage; e.g., Nakamura, 2010; Palmisano et al.,
2008). Over the years, these robust jitter and oscillation advantages for vection have
generated interest because their study should improve understanding of the mechanisms
underlying visual-vestibular interactions during self-motion perception (e.g., Snowden, 2000).
Despite their robustness, the perceptual mechanisms underlying these jitter or oscillation
advantages are still not fully understood. It is therefore necessary to examine the
relationship between jitter or oscillation and other factors which have been hypothesized
to be important for visually mediated self-motion perception. Accordingly, Nakamura
(2012) analyzed the role that stimulus size and eccentricity plays in the jitter advantage for
vection. It is well known that the size and eccentricity of the visual stimulus are among the
most critical factors in determining vection (e.g., Brandt et al., 1973), and hence, the analysis
of these effects in relation to the jitter advantage should also be important. The results of
Nakamura's (2012) psychophysical experiments indicated that jitter enhancement is maximal
2 i-Perception 0(0)
in conditions where the observer's central visual field is stimulated by the jittering motion.1 It
was originally believed that peripheral visual motion induces stronger vection (e.g., Brandt
et al., 1973; Delmore & Martin, 1986). However, more recent studies suggest that vection is
independent of the stimulus eccentricity (e.g., Nakamura, 2001; Nakamura & Shimojo, 1998;
Post, 1988). It is also widely accepted that larger areas of visual motion stimulation induce
stronger vection (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo, 1998). However, Nakamura (2012) found that
the jitter advantage for vection has rather different dependencies in terms of stimulus size,
compared with standard nonjittering vection.
Relative motion is one potential property of optic flow that appears to be important for
the onset and strength of vection. Vection is often stronger when a static visual reference is
presented along with the moving pattern (which results in relative motion between them)
compared with conditions where the moving pattern is presented alone (i.e., no object relative
motion; e.g., Howard & Howard, 1994; Nakamura, 2006a; Nakamura & Shimojo, 1999).
Similarly, it has been reported that the strength and direction of vection are determined as a
function of the relative motion between the moving pattern and the static visual target
(Howard & Heckman, 1989).
This study investigated the effects of relative motion on the oscillation advantage
for vection. We examined the following stimulus situation: a moving visual background
pattern viewed through a visually simulated nearby aperture. While the background pattern
always moved vertically (consistent with constant downwards vection), the aperture and the
background pattern could also be set to oscillate independently of each other (thereby
increasing the amount of relative oscillation). If oscillating (and also jittering) vection shares
the same dependency on relative visual motion as standard nonoscillating vection, then the
oscillation advantage should be: (a) stronger in conditions where the visual stimulus contains
strong relative oscillation among its components and (b) weaker when there is less relative
visual oscillation. We conducted four related experiments to tease apart the contributions of
relative oscillatory motion in either the perpendicular direction (Experiment 1), or parallel
(Experiment 2), to the principal (vertical) direction of simulated self-motion. We also
investigated the potential roles of visual motion adaptation (Experiment 3) and perceived
depth (Experiment 4) on the vection effects observed in Experiments 1 and 2.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 tested whether viewpoint oscillation advantages can be altered or modified by
the relative oscillation of a moving aperture. In addition to a centrally placed stationary
fixation point, we introduced a visually-simulated viewing aperture, through which
participants were able to observe a globally coherent optic flow pattern. The stimulus
pattern was a random-dot pattern which moved upward at a constant speed while also
oscillating horizontally in some conditions. The position of the viewing aperture could also
be oscillated horizontally either together with, or independently of, the pattern's oscillation.
This experimental setup enabled us to systematically manipulate the relative oscillation
between the aperture and the stimulus pattern. If the relative oscillation plays a role in
visual self-motion perception, then we predict that the aperture's oscillation in front of the
oscillating random-dot pattern should modulate or alter the strength of the induced vection.2
Two recent studies have shown that vection can be enhanced by providing a fixation target
that oscillates independently of the vection inducer (e.g., Nakamura, 2013a; Palmisano, Kim,
& Freeman, 2012). Even though the optic flow itself did not contain any acceleration, the
observer's pursuit eye movements in this situation appear to have added global oscillation to
the retinal flow, which enhanced vection in a similar fashion to adding an oscillating optic
Nakamura et al. 3
flow component to the vection inducer. In both of these studies, the fixation target not only had
a role in terms of controlling eye movements but also served as a reference for relative motion
against the flow pattern. In the present study, a visual component other than the fixation spot,
namely the simulated aperture, was set to oscillate in front of the visual flow pattern. As the
fixation spot was always statically located at in the center of the screen, this allowed us to
determine the effects of relative motion on vection independently of the observer's eye
movements (and their flow-on consequences in terms of the retinal image motion).
Materials and Method
Participants. Eighteen undergraduate volunteers (4 males and 14 females with ages ranging
from 17 to 52 years old) at the University of Wollongong participated in the experiment. All
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and reported no deficits in
either their visual or vestibular perception. None of the participants had previous
experience participating in vection experiments and all were nai¨ve as to the purpose of this
experiment. The University of Wollongong Ethics Committee approved the study in advance,
and each subject provided written informed consent before participating in the study.
Stimulus and apparatus. The visual stimulus employed in the experiment was composed of a
visually simulated (near) aperture and (far) random-dot pattern. The random-dot pattern
consisted of randomly positioned blue dots (4.6 cd/cm2) which moved upward at a constant
speed of 30/s, and (in some conditions) also oscillated horizontally in a sinusoidal fashion
with an amplitude of 6 and a frequency of 1 Hz. The radii of the dots contained in the
pattern varied randomly across the display (ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 in visual angle).
The background of the random-dot pattern was black (0.5 cd/cm2). The aperture, through
which the participants observed the motion of the random-dot pattern, was created by
superimposing a peripheral annular area of uniform dark gray texture onto the display
(2.6 cd/cm2). The result was that the random-dot pattern was only visible within a central
circular area of the display which had a radius of 30. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the visual
stimulus employed in this experiment. In some conditions, the horizontal position of the
aperture was oscillated around the center of the screen with an identical amplitude and
frequency as the random-dot pattern; however, the phase of the oscillation was also
manipulated. A 0.5 red fixation spot (luminance: 6.4 cd/m2) was presented at the center of
the screen. Participants were requested to always fixate their eyes on this spot throughout the
experimental trial. Eye-movement recordings of eight participants confirmed that the
presence of this fixation spot was sufficient to exclude potential artefacts of unintended eye
movements during experimental trials (Figure 2). Demo movies of the visual stimuli
employed in the experiment are also provided as supplementary material. The random-dot
pattern was always perceived to be located behind the aperture--confirmed in the debriefing
sessions (also confirmed in Experiment 4 where observers reported perceived depth of the
visual stimulus, instead of perceived self-motion).
These visual stimuli were generated and controlled by a personal computer equipped
with an OpenGL compatible graphics card and presented on a 2 Â 2 m screen using a DLP
projector (Mitsubishi XD400U) with a resolution of 1024 Â 768 and a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
All experiments were conducted in a darkened experimental room; the visual stimulus display
was the sole light source in the room. The participants sat on a chair in front of the screen
with a viewing distance of 150 cm. They observed the stimulus with their eyes fixed to a
physical (real) viewing booth, so that they could not see the edges of the screen (although all
of the visual display, including black background, was still visible through the booth),

and their heads were roughly held stationary because the viewing booth was fixed to an
immovable frame.
There were two independent variables in this experiment. The first was the pattern
oscillation. In the pattern oscillation condition, the upward moving random-dot pattern
also oscillated horizontally. In the no pattern oscillation condition, the random-dot
pattern only moved upward. The other independent variable was the aperture oscillation,
and there were three different conditions. In the in-phase aperture oscillation condition, the
aperture was set to oscillate horizontally with the same amplitude, frequency and phase as the
random-dot pattern, and thus, the aperture oscillation was completely synchronized with
that of the random-dot pattern. In the counter-phase aperture oscillation condition, the
phase of the aperture's oscillation was shifted 180 with respect to the random-dot pattern.
Thus, in this condition, the random-dot pattern and the aperture were oscillated in opposite
directions. There was also a no aperture oscillation condition, in which the aperture never
moved and remained static in the central position.
There were six different stimulus conditions in total (2 [pattern oscillation, no pattern
oscillation] Â 3 [in-phase, counter-phase, and no aperture oscillations]). It should be noted
that in the no pattern oscillation condition, the in-phase and counter-phase aperture
oscillations both resulted in identical visual stimulation. In these conditions, the random-dot
pattern moved upward without horizontal oscillation and the aperture oscillated horizontally
in front of it. Both of these conditions generate identical patterns of retinal motion.
Procedure. The participant's task was to report perceived self-motion (vection) by pressing
a mouse button. It was emphasized that he or she needed to hold the button down as
long as their vection experience continued and release it if the vection dropped out during
the trial. Directly after each 30-second stimulus observation, participants were also
required to rate the strength of the vection experienced during that trial using method of
magnitude estimation (Stevens, 1957). Participants were first exposed to the standard
stimulus, which was identical to displays used in conditions with no aperture and no
pattern oscillation. The vection experienced with this standard stimulus was assigned a
strength of ``50'' (the modulus), and participants were instructed to estimate the strength
of vection in subsequent experimental trials based on this reference. For example, if
participants perceived that the vection strength for a trial was 30% stronger than that
experienced for the standard condition, they evaluated it as ``65.'' In experimental trials
where the participants did not experience any vection, estimates were assigned as ``0.''
To establish the modulus for these strength estimates and allow the participants to
become familiar with the experimental procedure, a single observation of the standard
stimulus was executed before the experimental trials. Each participant was then presented
with three repeats of the six different experimental conditions in a randomized order.
They could request to take a short rest and observe the standard stimulus whenever they
were required.
Vection onset latency was calculated based on the time it took from the start of the trial
until the observer first pressed a mouse button. Because there were very few vection dropouts,
total vection durations were highly correlated with vection onset latencies (Pearson's
coefficient of correlation was À0.75 in the case of the current experiment). Accordingly, we
only analyzed vection onset latencies and vection strength ratings (not total vection
durations) in order to avoid redundancy. Prior to conducting these analyses, vection onset
latencies and vection strength ratings were averaged across observers. Then a two-way
repeated measurement analysis of variance (rANOVA) with a factorial design of 2 (pattern
oscillation) Â 3 (aperture oscillation) was then applied for each of the vection indices.

Results and Discussion
Figure 3 shows averaged latency and estimated strength of vection measured in each
experimental condition. rANOVAs revealed a significant main effect of the pattern
oscillation for both vection indices (latency: F(1, 17) ¼ 10.67, p ¼ .005, pZ2 ¼ .39;
estimation: F(1, 17) ¼ 19.43, p < .001, pZ2 ¼ .53). Latency was shorter, and estimated
strength was higher in the pattern oscillation conditions than in the no oscillation
condition. Thus, it can be concluded that vertical vection was stronger in the presence of
horizontal random-dot pattern oscillation than without it. This replicates the findings of
previous studies that presented optic flow without an aperture (e.g., Nakamura, 2010;
Palmisano et al., 2008). rANOVAs also indicated a significant main effect of aperture
oscillation for latency (F(2, 34) ¼ 3.45, p ¼ .043, pZ2 ¼ .17) but not for estimated strength
(F(2, 34) ¼ 2.30, p ¼ .12, pZ2 ¼ .12). Latency was shorter in the aperture oscillation conditions
than in the no aperture oscillation conditions.
A significant two-way interaction between pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation was
also found for latency (F(2, 34) ¼ 3.56, p ¼ .039, pZ2 ¼ .17). However, this interaction only
approached marginal significance level for estimated strength (F(2, 34) ¼ 2.76, p ¼ .077,
pZ2 ¼ .14). Due to the significant interaction observed for latency, a further analysis of
variance was conducted in order to examine the simple main effects of aperture oscillation
separately for each pattern oscillation condition. Simple main effects were significant in the
no pattern oscillation condition (F(2, 34) ¼ 4.58, p ¼ .017, pZ2 ¼ .21), and marginally
significant in the pattern oscillation condition (F(2, 34) ¼ 3.00, p ¼ .063, pZ2 ¼ .15).

which the random-dot pattern was set to move purely upward at a constant speed. The solid bars indicate
the pattern oscillation conditions in which the pattern moved upward with horizontal oscillation. The abscissa
indicates the oscillations of the aperture. In the in-phase oscillation condition, the aperture oscillated with the
same phase as the random-dot pattern. In the counter-phase oscillation condition, the phase of the aperture's
oscillation was shifted 180 with respect to the random-dot pattern. In the no aperture oscillation condition,
the aperture remained static in the central position.
Nakamura et al. 7
Multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction ( ¼ 0.05) were executed, and the main
results of these comparisons are discussed later.
In the no pattern oscillation condition, vection onset latency was significantly shorter for the
aperture oscillation conditions (in-phase and counter-phase) than for the no aperture oscillation
condition. This indicates that horizontal aperture oscillation was able to reduce vection onset
latencies even when the background random-dot pattern moved purely upward (i.e., when the
pattern had no horizontal oscillation of its own and only the aperture motion provided any visual
acceleration). In the pattern oscillation condition, latency was significantly shorter in the counter-
phase aperture oscillation than in the in-phase condition. Adding pattern oscillation in no
aperture oscillation and counter-phase aperture oscillation conditions also significantly reduced
vection latencies (relative to no pattern oscillation conditions). However, adding pattern
oscillation provided no significant benefit when this pattern oscillation was in-phase with the
aperture oscillation.
The above findings all appear consistent with the hypothesis that relative motion is critical
for the oscillation advantage in vection. Relative oscillation in the counter-phase condition
was twice that of the no aperture oscillation condition; by contrast, no relative oscillation was
visible between the aperture and the pattern in the in-phase condition. Thus, the pattern
oscillation might have improved vection because it increased the level of relative oscillation
between the aperture and pattern in conditions when the aperture was stationary or when the
aperture was moving in a counter-phase fashion. However, there was less benefit of adding
pattern oscillation when it was in-phase with the aperture oscillation, as the aperture and
pattern were seen to move together as one (i.e., there was less relative motion between these
two visual features than during aperture oscillation alone; the only relative motion would
have been between these visual features and the static fixation point). When there was no
aperture oscillation, vection latency was shorter in the pattern oscillation condition than in
the no pattern oscillation condition. Relative oscillation between the aperture and the
random-dot pattern only occurred in the former condition, not in the latter one. Thus, the
results in the no aperture condition were also consistent with our relative motion hypothesis.
It should be noted that the simple main effect of the aperture oscillation was only marginally
significant when there was pattern oscillation, which could be attributed to residual pattern
motion relative to fixation. Although there was no relative oscillation between the aperture and
the random-dot pattern in the in-phase aperture oscillation condition, pattern oscillation may
have significantly increased vection (compared with the standard nonoscillating condition)
because of the its motion relative to the static fixation spot (the possible effect of the fixation
spot as a reference for relative motion will be discussed further in section General Discussion). It
is possible that additional effects of the relative aperture oscillation might have been somewhat
obscured due to the presence of this fixation spot increasing the strength of the baseline vection.
The results of Experiment 1 were discussed earlier in relation to the relative oscillation
between the random-dot pattern and the aperture (where the aperture provided a spatial
frame of reference for interpreting all of the available visual motion). However, it was also
possible that the motion of the aperture might have independently affected the observer's
perception of self-motion. To address this possibility, we conducted an additional experiment
with nine nai¨ve observers who did not take part in Experiment 1. In this experiment, the
random-dot pattern was always static and only the aperture was oscillated horizontally.
Stimulus dimensions and the procedure used to measure perceived self-motion were both
identical to those of the main experiment. Although vection was consistently induced by the
standard stimulus, none of the nine observers reported experiencing vection with this new
stimulus. Thus, it can be concluded that the effects of aperture oscillation found in
Experiment 1 were due to the relative oscillation between the random-dot pattern and the
8 i-Perception 0(0)
aperture, not the aperture oscillation by itself. The presence of a static random-dot pattern
presented behind the oscillating near aperture is known to strongly inhibit vection (as it was
shown to do here). Research has shown that a moving foreground cannot induce self-motion
perception in the presence of a static background (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo, 1999).
The results of this experiment revealed that, even with the eyes held stationary, the relative
oscillation between the two visual stimuli had the potential to facilitate self-motion perception
(at least in terms of the vection time course; the reason why similar effects could not be
confirmed for estimated strength will be discussed later in section General Discussion).
Experiment 2
In this second experiment, the effects of relative oscillation on vection were investigated
further using conditions where the stimulus pattern moved upward at a constant speed
and oscillated vertically behind an aperture which could also be set to oscillate vertically.
Hence, the oscillation occurred in the same direction as the constant velocity pattern motion
(unlike Experiment 1 where any oscillation always occurred in an orthogonal direction to the
constant velocity pattern motion). Previous studies suggest that jitter or oscillation
advantages for vection only arise when the additional acceleration is orthogonal to the
main (constant speed) motion of the visual inducer; these advantages either disappeared or
were substantially diminished when the added acceleration was parallel to the main motion
(e.g., Nakamura, 2010; Palmisano et al., 2008).
Methods
Participants. Ten nai¨ve undergraduate volunteers who did not participate in Experiment 1
acted as observers in Experiment 2 (5 men and 5 women, aged 18­46 years old).
Stimuli. The stimuli and apparatus employed in Experiment 2 were almost identical to those in
Experiment 1. The sole difference was the direction of the oscillation assigned to the random-
dot pattern and the aperture. In Experiment 2, the random-dot pattern was set to move upward
at a constant speed (30/s) while oscillating vertically (frequency: 1 Hz, amplitude: 6).
The aperture was also set to oscillate vertically in some conditions.
Procedure. The procedures used to measure vection strength and latency in Experiment 2 were
exactly the same as those used in Experiment 1. There were two independent variables as in
Experiment 1: pattern oscillation and aperture type. Trials for each stimulus condition were
repeated 3 times in a randomized order, and thus, each participant executed 18 trials in total.
The modulus for vection strength estimation was set using the same visual stimulus used in
Experiment 1 (no aperture or pattern oscillation). An estimate of 50 was assigned for vection
strength as strong as self-motion perception induced by the standard stimulus.
Results and Discussion
Figure 4 shows the averaged latency and estimated strength of vection for each of the
stimulus conditions. rANOVA revealed that only the main effects for pattern oscillation
were significant (latency: F(1, 9) ¼ 5.23, p ¼ .048, pZ2 ¼ .37; estimation: F(1, 9) ¼ 9.15,
p ¼ .014, pZ2 ¼ .50). Vection was found to be weaker (as indicated by longer latencies and
lower estimates) in the vertical pattern oscillation condition than in the no pattern oscillation
condition. Thus it appears that vertical vection can be impaired by adding vertical oscillation
Nakamura et al. 9
to the constant vertical pattern motion. In previous research, adding jitter or oscillation
along the same axis as the main constant motion component did not significantly alter
vection strength (there was no facilitation or suppression of vection--see Nakamura, 2010;
Palmisano et al., 2008). However, in the current experiment, adding vertical pattern
oscillation significantly decreased the strength and increased the latency of vertical vection.
These effects might have been due to the fact that, in the experiments reported in this article,
the random-dot pattern (the primary inducer of vection) was always presented centrally and
had a circular area of limited size. As a result, the vection induced might have been somewhat
weaker compared with previous studies with large or full field presentations. It is well known
that vection strength increases as a function of stimulus size (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo,
1998). Thus, the relatively weak vection observed for the control condition (constant visual
motion without the pattern oscillation) might have been responsible for vection decline when
vertical pattern oscillation was added.
The main effects of the aperture oscillation were not significant for either vection measure
(latency: F(2, 18) ¼ .15, p ¼ .86, pZ2 ¼ .017; estimation: F(2, 18) ¼ .14, p ¼ .87, pZ2 ¼ .015).
The interactions between pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation also did not reach
significance (latency: F(2, 18) ¼ 1.90, p ¼ .18, pZ2 ¼ .17; estimation: F(2, 18) ¼ 2.10, p ¼ .15,
pZ2 ¼ .18). These results suggest that vection was unaffected by aperture oscillation and
combined aperture-and-pattern oscillation when the aperture oscillation occurred parallel
to the direction of perceived self-motion.
Experiment 3
In Experiment 3, we measured durations of the motion aftereffects generated by each of the
stimuli used previously in Experiment 1. The rationale for conducting this experiment was that a
number of vection studies have argued that jitter and oscillation might alter vection by affecting
the observer's adaptation to the visual motion stimulation (e.g., Kim & Khuu, 2014; Palmisano
et al., 2000, 2012; Seno, Palmisano, & Ito, 2011). This is because a complicated moving stimulus,
which contains visual acceleration (i.e., jitter or oscillation) and transiently varies its local
velocity, should be difficult for a local motion detector to adapt to (compared with a simple
moving pattern that has a constant speed). Thus, if the visual oscillations assigned to either the
random-dot pattern or the aperture altered vection in Experiment 1 by reducing adaptation

(Experiment 2). Error bars indicate SEMs.

to the visual inducer, then evidence of this should be seen in terms of the durations of the motion
aftereffects observed directly after exposure to the optic flow.
Methods
Participants. Eight observers participated in this experiment (4 men and 4 women, aged 18­46
years old). One of these was an author (S. N.). The other seven observers were nai¨ve
undergraduate volunteers who did not participate in either Experiments 1 or 2.
Stimuli. The stimuli and apparatus employed in Experiment 3 were identical to those in
Experiment 1--with the following exceptions. The visual stimulus was set to move for 30
seconds (adaptation phase), then all motion stopped and a static version of the visual
stimulus was continuously presented on the screen (test phase).
Procedure. Participants kept the mouse button pressed as long as they experienced the motion
aftereffect, and released it as soon as the aftereffect dissipated. The duration of the motion
aftereffect (i.e., the time between when the stimulus motion stopped and when the mouse
button was finally released) was recorded as an index of the strength of adaptation to the
prolonged exposure to the visual inducer's motion, just as in several previous studies (e.g.,
Kim & Khuu, 2014; Palmisano et al., 2012). As in Experiment 1, there were two independent
variables namely random-dot pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation.
Results and Discussion
Figure 5 shows the averaged durations of the motion aftereffect obtained for each
stimulus condition. A two-way rANOVA was used to analyze this motion aftereffect
duration data. The main effects of pattern oscillation and aperture oscillation were
not significant (pattern oscillation: F(1, 7) ¼ 1.56, p ¼ .25, pZ2 ¼ .18; aperture oscillation:
F(2, 14) ¼ 1.30, p ¼ .13, pZ2 ¼ .25). Two-way interactions between pattern oscillation
and aperture oscillation were also not significant (F(2, 14) ¼ 2.17, p ¼ .15, pZ2 ¼ .23).
Thus, the durations of the motion aftereffects generated by 30-second exposures to optic
flow were not significantly altered by either pattern or aperture oscillation. Motion
aftereffect durations were on average approximately 2 seconds long across all of the
different conditions tested.
The main purpose of Experiment 3 was to determine whether differences in the degree of
adaptation to the visual motion might account for the effects of stimulus oscillation on
vection. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-experimental comparison of the vection
(measured in Experiment 1) and the motion aftereffects (Experiment 3) produced by the
various stimulus conditions. Aperture oscillation, or the relative oscillation between the
pattern and the aperture, was shown to significantly alter vection onset latency. However,
it did not modulate the motion aftereffect. Some previous studies have argued that adding
visually simulated accelerations to the visual inducer might disrupt adaptation to optic flow,
and that this reduced motion adaptation might be partially responsible for jitter or oscillation
advantages for vection (e.g., Kim & Khuu, 2014). On the other hand, other studies have also
failed to find significant correlations between vection strength and motion adaptation, similar
to the current experiment (e.g., Palmisano et al., 2012). Thus, it appears that motion
adaptation cannot fully explain vection increases caused by the addition of pattern and
aperture oscillation in Experiment 1. Some consideration is therefore required when
invoking the role of motion adaptation to account for vection.

Experiment 4
In the psychophysical experiments reported in this article, we mainly discussed the effects of
relative oscillation between the random-dot pattern and the aperture on vection. Observers
always perceived that the aperture was located in front of the background random-dot
pattern, even though no binocular disparity information was provided about the simulated
depth separation (all of the components in the visual stimulus were presented coplanar on the
screen). However, it was possible that manipulations of the relative oscillation between
the aperture and the random-dot pattern altered the perceived depth represented by the
display (via motion parallax), which in turn might have affected vection (e.g., Andersen &
Braunstein, 1985). Experiment 4 tested this explanation by comparing the perceptions of
display depth experienced for each stimulus used in Experiment 1.
Methods
In this experiment, we measured the perceived depth separation between the aperture and the
random-dot pattern (instead of the observer's perceived self-motion). We used visual stimulus
conditions that were identical to those of Experiment 1. Nine undergraduate students (4 men
and 5 women, aged 19­21 years old) participated in this experiment (they had not taken part
in Experiments 1­3). In the experimental trials, they estimated the perceived depth separation
between the aperture and the random-dot pattern and verbally reported it. The standard
stimulus for these depth estimates was again the no aperture and no pattern oscillation
condition. The perceived separation in depth for this standard stimulus was assigned a
value of ``50'' (the modulus for their subsequent magnitude estimates).
Results and Discussion
Figure 6 shows the mean estimated depth separations between the aperture and the random-
dot pattern for each stimulus condition. rANOVA revealed that the main effect of aperture

oscillation was significant (F(2, 16) ¼ 4.52, p ¼ .028, pZ2 ¼ .36). While the main effect of
pattern oscillation was not significant (F(1, 8) ¼ 1.06, p ¼ .33, pZ2 ¼ .12), the interaction
between aperture oscillation and pattern oscillation was significant (F(2, 16) ¼ 10.76,
p ¼ .001, pZ2 ¼ .57). Multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction (a ¼ 0.05) indicated
that perceived depth separation was significantly reduced (by $ 25%) in the in-phase aperture
and random-dot pattern oscillation condition (compared with other conditions). No other
differences in the depth perception were found.
In Experiment 1, we revealed that the in-phase aperture-and-pattern oscillation increased
vection onset latency, indicating that self-motion perception was weakened in that condition.
It is possible that the decline in vection observed for this condition might have been due to
decreased depth perception. However, even in this condition, all of the observers still
perceived the aperture to be in front of the random-dot pattern. Previous studies have also
shown that it is the depth order among visual components (in terms of foreground­
background relationships), not a depth separation between them, that is critical for self-
motion perception (Nakamura, 2006b). Thus we would argue that it is unlikely variation
in perceived depth accounted for the experience of vection in this case. It should also be noted
that in the counter-phase aperture-and-pattern oscillation condition, there was no perceived
depth enhancement, even though vection was facilitated in Experiment 1. Thus, at best,
perceived depth can only partially account for the effect of relative oscillation on vection
(decrement in the in-phase aperture oscillation condition).
General Discussion
Our psychophysical experiments investigated the effects on vection of adding oscillation
(directly and indirectly) to the visual inducer. A simulated nearby visual aperture was
provided which could be set to oscillate independently of the primary vection inducer, that
is, the moving background random-dot pattern. Experiment 1 revealed that horizontal
aperture oscillation could alter the onset latency of vertical vection induced by the
background flow--with the nature of this effect depending on the amount of relative
oscillation between the random-dot pattern and the aperture. When the random-dot
pattern only moved upward, horizontal aperture oscillation (in front of the pattern)
reduced vection onsets--most likely due to the increased relative oscillation between these
two visual components. When the pattern also oscillated, in-phase aperture oscillation

appeared to weaken vection, whereas counter-phase aperture oscillation appeared to
facilitate it (presumably by doubling the amount of relative oscillation compared with the
no aperture oscillation condition). Although Experiment 1 found that horizontal aperture
and pattern oscillation can improve vertical vection, Experiment 2 found that vertical pattern
oscillation actually impaired vertical vection. However, unlike vertical pattern oscillation,
vertical aperture oscillation did not appear to alter either the strength or the latency of
vertical vection. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the effects of horizontal aperture and
pattern oscillation on vertical vection could not be explained by reduced motion
adaptation, as motion aftereffect durations did not appear to vary significantly as a
function of the different conditions. Finally, Experiment 4 demonstrated that modulations
in perceived display depth (arising due to differences in motion parallax) could not account
for all of the effects of relative oscillation on vection.
The Effects of Visual Aperture on Self-Motion Perception
In the psychophysical experiments reported here, we introduced a simulated aperture into the
visual stimulus to manipulate relative motion against the visual inducer. This aperture limited
the visual stimulation to a central circular area with a radius of 30 in visual angle. It is
possible that the inclusion of this aperture weakened vection--as vection tends to increase
with the area of visual motion stimulation (e.g., Nakamura & Shimojo, 1998). Consistent
with this notion, average vection latencies in the present experiments were somewhat longer
than might be expected in inducing conditions with a larger field-of-view. However, because
this aperture was clearly seen to be in the foreground, it also strengthened participants'
perceptions that the moving random-dot pattern lay in the background (confirmed
during debriefing). Previous studies have shown that compelling vection only occurs when
the optic flow field is perceived to be in the background (e.g., Brandt et al., 1973; Nakamura
& Shimojo, 1999; Ohmi, Howard, & Landolt, 1987). Indeed some researchers have
hypothesized that vection is primarily induced by visual stimuli perceived to be in the
background, and that visual factors which enhance this background perception boost self-
motion perception (object-background hypothesis; Seno, Ito, & Sunaga, 2009; c.f., Kim &
Tran, 2016). Thus, it is likely that the strengthening of the optic flow's perceived background
status (by the inclusion of the nearby aperture) partially compensated for any effects on
vection of having a visual motion inducer that was of a limited size.
The Effects of Relative Oscillation Between the Visual Pattern and the Aperture
The main purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of relative oscillation between
visual components (the random-dot flow field and an aperture) on vection. Experiment 1
revealed that vection latency decreased when a horizontally oscillating aperture was
positioned in front of the self-motion inducing flow pattern. In that experiment, vection
strength was best explained as a function of the relative motion between the random-dot
pattern and the aperture; vection latency decreased in the counter-phase aperture oscillation
condition (which should have doubled the speed of the relative motion compared with the no
aperture oscillation condition), and increased during in-phase aperture oscillation (which
should have diminished the relative motion between aperture and flow field). These results
suggest that the oscillation advantage in vection is determined not only by the visual oscillation
of the inducer itself but also by the relative oscillation between foreground and background
visual elements (the aperture and the random-dot pattern, respectively, in this investigation).
Several previous studies have revealed that vection is strongly affected by relative motion
14 i-Perception 0(0)
or motion contrast among visual components, which also influences other visual motion
perceptions, namely Dunker illusion (e.g., Heckmann & Howard, 1991; Howard &
Heckman, 1989; Howard & Howard, 1994). In debriefing sessions, our participants often
reported that their perceptions of the horizontally oscillating random-dot patterns did
depend on the motion of the aperture; perceived oscillation of the pattern was
strengthened in the counter-phase aperture oscillation condition (where relative motion
was doubled), and weakened when there was no relative motion in the in-phase aperture
oscillation condition. We propose that the effect of aperture oscillation on vection in
Experiment 1 can be explained by the strength of the perceived oscillatory motion
modulated by the relative motion between the aperture and flow field.
It is also noteworthy that the estimated strength of vection was not significantly affected by
aperture oscillation in the current study (only vection onset latency). This null finding might
indicate that the effects of relative motion were moderately weak in the current experimental
setup. The relative motion in our displays always existed only in restricted narrow regions at
the edge of the simulated visual aperture (which was located 30 out from the center of the
observer's visual field). It is possible that such relative motion effects might be strengthened in
future by introducing multiple small apertures covering the random-dot pattern, or using two
overlapping random-dot patterns (similar to those used by Nakamura, 2013b; Nakamura &
Shimojo, 1999, 2000). This would allow us to obtain much stronger relative motion compared
with using only the one aperture in the present experiments. Through such investigation will
we learn more about the effects of accelerating visual motion (jitter or oscillation) on vection,
and self-motion perception more generally.
The Possible Effects of Relative Motion Against the Fixation Spot
In the psychophysical experiments reported in this article, a static fixation spot was always
presented on the center of the visual display. Thus, although we have concentrated on
analyzing the effect of the relative oscillation between the aperture and the random-dot
pattern, motions were actually relative to three different visual components, namely, the
random-dot pattern, the aperture, and the fixation spot. In the condition with no pattern
and no aperture oscillation, there was no relative oscillation with respect to any of these three
visual components. In the in-phase pattern and aperture oscillation, while there was no
relative oscillation between the pattern and the aperture, there was still relative oscillation
of the pattern and aperture with respect to the static fixation spot. In Experiment 1, vection
onset latency was significantly shorter in the ``in-phase aperture oscillation'' condition than in
the ``no pattern and no aperture oscillation'' condition (see Figure 3). We propose that the
relative oscillation between the pattern þ aperture and the fixation spot decreased the onset of
vection in the former condition (relative to the latter condition). In this situation, a single
static visual object presented in the center of the visual field also appeared to serve as a useful
reference for relative oscillation.
Palmisano et al. (2012) and also Nakamura (2013a) have previously reported that vection
can be increased by making oscillatory eye movements (to follow a moving fixation target)
when viewing a nonoscillating pattern of optic flow. These studies demonstrate that vection
can be enhanced by retinal oscillation alone (even when there is no oscillation of the optic
flow field; see also Kim & Palmisano, 2010). The current investigation also shows that a
stationary (as opposed to moving) fixation target can facilitate vection by acting as a frame of
reference for relative motion. Thus, these previous vection advantages (found when visually
pursuing a moving fixation spot) may have been jointly generated by the retinal image
acceleration (due to the eye movement) and the presence of a frame of reference for
Nakamura et al. 15
relative motion (due to the presence of the fixation spot). Future experiments should
try to distinguish between the effects of retinal oscillation and relative motion on vection,
by controlling or monitoring eye movement under various observational conditions either
with or without explicit fixation target. This should provide exciting avenues to explore more
parametrically the potential role of eye movements on relative motion, and in turn, self-
motion perception.

Notes
1. Consistent with this notion Palmisano and Kim (2009; Experiment 1B) also reported that viewpoint
jitter produced the greatest vection improvements when participants either looked or fixated
centrally (as opposed to peripherally) in the optic flow display.
2. Here we refer to ``relative oscillation'' as the horizontal oscillatory relative motion between the
random-dot pattern and the aperture (i.e., velocity was sinusoidally modulated). This is
differentiated from general relative motion because all of the displays tested had relative motion
between the aperture and the constant upward motion of the random-dot pattern (even in the
standard nonoscillating condition).
