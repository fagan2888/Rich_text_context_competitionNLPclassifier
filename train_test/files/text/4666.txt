Abstract
Objective: To utilize prokaryotic gene expression and protein microarray to develop and evaluate
a sensitive, accurate protein microarray assay for detecting antienterovirus antibodies in serum
samples from patients with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and
coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), two common causative agents for HFMD, were used for assay
development.
Methods: Serum was collected from patients with HFMD and healthy controls. EV71 and CA16
VP1 and VP3 genes were expressed in transfected Escherichia coli; the resultant VP1 and 3 proteins
were used in a microarray assay for human serum EV71 and CA16 immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG.
To validate the microarray assay, serum samples were tested for EV71 IgM using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results: Out of 50 patients with HFMD, EV71 IgM and CA16 IgM was detected in 80% and 44% of
serum samples, respectively, using protein microarray, and EV71 IgM was detected in 78% of samples
using ELISA. Protein microarray and ELISA showed 100% specificity for EV71-IgM detection.
Conclusion: The protein microarray assay developed in the present study shows potential as a
sensitive technique for detecting EV71 IgM in serum samples from patients with HFMD.

Introduction
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus
A16 (CA16) are two of the most common
causative agents of hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD).1 EV71 may cause various
neurological diseases such as aseptic menin-
gitis, acute flaccid paralysis and fatal
encephalitis;2 several EV71 outbreaks, asso-
ciated with severe neurological complica-
tions, have been reported in Western Pacific
countries or regions.3­6 HFMD has emerged
as the most prevalent infectious disease
among children in China. The pathogenesis
underlying EV71 and CA16 infections
remains unclear and although no vaccines
or antiviral therapies are available for the
prevention or treatment of EV71 infection,
progress has been made in recent years.
Several compounds with a variety of mech-
anisms of action have been shown to inhibit
EV71 replication, but none has been
advanced to human clinical trials.7,8 An
effective approach to prevent EV71 out-
breaks would be to develop a vaccine with
a favourable safety and efficacy profile, and
EV71 vaccine development has been under-
way in China and Singapore, with three
companies in China completing Phase III
clinical trials of inactivated EV71 vac-
cines.9,10 Thus, determination of the patho-
gen causing HFMD, for effective early
treatment, is desirable.
Virus isolation using cell/tissue culture
remains the gold standard for enterovirus
diagnosis.11 Molecular methods, such as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques
including reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
and real-time PCR, have been developed to
detect EV71 and CA16 viral RNA in
patients with HFMD.12­15 In addition,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) techniques have been developed
to detect antibodies for the clinical diagnosis
of HFMD.16,17 The aim of the present study
was to develop a rapid, sensitive and more
specific and effective diagnostic method for
detecting EV71 in clinical specimens.
The genus Enterovirus belongs to the
Picornaviridae family and consists of 66
different subtypes, including polioviruses,
coxsackievirus group A and coxsackievirus
group B, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.18
The different genogroups of EV71 are
widely distributed around the world.2 The
EV71 genome possesses $7 500 nucleotides
and encodes four structural capsid proteins
(VP4, VP2, VP3 and VP1), and seven
nonstructural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A,
3B, 3C and 3D). The structure protein VP1
is considered to be variable and to play an
important role in characterizing antigeni-
city.18,19 Few studies have investigated EV71
VP3 structure protein to characterize anti-
genicity, and data are limited.20
Another form of medical diagnosis
uses detection of particular antibodies.
Antibodies exist as different isotypes,
namely immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgD, IgE,
IgG and IgM. IgM antibodies appear early
in the course of infection, then disappear
(IgM titres usually fall within 2 months and
normalize within 4­6 months); IgM usually
reappears to a lesser extent following further
antigen exposure. After an acute infection,
elevated IgG levels may persist for several
years and occasionally be detectable over the
3 years following acute infection.21,22
In the present study, VP1 and VP3 were
selected as antigens to detect antibodies
(IgG and IgM) in serum samples from
patients with HFMD using protein micro-
arrays, with the aim of developing this assay
technique as a convenient, sensitive and
economic diagnostic tool for HFMD.
Patients and methods
Study population and serum samples
This study sequentially recruited patients
with acute HFMD who were admitted to
Beijing YouAn Hospital, Beijing, China
between February 2012 and February
2014. Inclusion criteria were as follows:
children aged <5 years; clinical features of
288 Journal of International Medical Research 44(2)
HFMD (including fever, sore throat, ulcers
in the throat, mouth and tongue, headache,
and rash with vesicles on the hands, feet and
inguinal area); presence of EV71 and (or)
CA16 RNA in vesicular fluid, blood and
urine samples, detected using RT-PCR in
the clinical laboratory of Beijing YouAn
Hospital. Data from the prior RT-PCR
analyses were compared with the protein
microarray results from the present study, to
evaluate the microarray assay.
Serum samples were collected from
patients enrolled in the study as follows:
using standard methods, 2 ml of venous
blood was collected between day 1 and day
5 following onset of fever or skin lesions.
Blood samples were allowed to clot at 4C
for 24 h. Samples were then centrifuged at
3000­4000 r.p.m. at 4C for 2 min. The
serum from each sample was transferred to
a new tube and stored at 4C prior to use.
Serum samples were also collected from
healthy blood donors living in Beijing. All
blood from donations was routinely
screened for blood-borne pathogens, includ-
ing: HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus,
syphilis, malaria and bacterial contamin-
ation, using standard screening techniques.
The study protocol was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Beijing YouAn
Hospital, Beijing, China. Written informed
consent was obtained from the patients or
their legal proxies. Verbal informed consent
was obtained from the healthy controls.
Amplification and cloning of viral VP1
and VP3 genes
Full-length EV71 and CA16 cDNAs
(provided as gifts from the National
Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical
and Biological Products, Beijing, China),
were used as templates for amplification of
the peptide coding region. EV71 and CA16
VP1 and VP3 protein sequences were
retrieved from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez
Protein Database. PCR amplification of
four genes (EV71 VP1, EV71 VP3, CA16
VP1 and CA16 VP3) was performed using
ReadyMixTM Taq PCR Reaction Mix with
MgCl2
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) and the following primer sequences:
EV71 VP1 forward, 50-GCGGATCCGG
AGATAGGGTGGCAGAT-30;
EV71 VP1 reverse, 50-GCGAATTCAAGA
GTGGTGATCGATGT-30;
EV71 VP3 forward, 50-GCGAATTCGGG

CA16 VP3 forward, 50-GCGCGGCCGC
GGCATACCAACAGAGCTC-30;
CA16 VP3 reverse, 50-GCCTCGAGTTG
TATATTAGCCGTTTG-30.
Each 50 -ml reaction contained 1 ml of
forward primer, 1 ml of reverse primer, 5 ml
template DNA, 25 ml of 2 Â ReadyMixTM
Taq PCR Reaction Mix, and 18 ml H2
O. The
cycling programme involved preliminary
denaturation at 95C for 5 min, followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 20 s,
annealing at 58C for 60 s, and elongation at
72C for 60 s, followed by a final elongation
step at 72C for 20 min. The resultant four
PCR products were each cloned into pET-
28a expression vectors (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) for production of
His-tagged fusion proteins. The pET-28a
vector and amplified gene were digested
with the following restriction enzymes
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA,
USA), respectively for 1 h at 37C according
to the manufacturer's instructions: EcoR1
and XhoI (EV71 VP3); BamHI and EcoRI
(EV71 VP1); SmaI and XhoI (CA16 VP3
and CA16 VP1). Plasmid DNA and PCR
fragments were then purified using
Zhang et al. 289
QIAprepÕ Spin Miniprep Kit and
QIAquickÕ Gel Extraction and PCR purifi-
cation kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. T4 DNA ligase enzyme (Fermentas,
St. Leon-Rot, Germany) was used to insert
the digested and purified PCR fragment into
the digested vector (incubated for 1 h
at 22C).
Cloning was confirmed by the release of
insert from the vector on double digestion
with the restriction enzymes EcoR1 and
XhoI (EV71 VP3) in NEBuffer 3.1 (New
Engand Biolabs) at 37C for 2 h, BamHI
and EcoRI (EV71 VP1) in NEBuffer 3.1 at
37C for 2 h, and Sma I and Xho I (CA16
VP3, CA16 VP1) in CutSmartÕ Buffer first
at 25C with SmaI for 2 h, then with XhoI
added, raised to 37C for 2 h. The expression
plasmid was then sequenced by Sino Geno
Max Co., Ltd, Beijing, China using a genetic
analyser (ABI PrismÕ 3700, Applied
Biosystems Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Expression and purification of VP1 and
VP3 recombinant proteins
Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) cells (Qiagen,
Hong Kong, China) were transfected with
each of the four pET-28a enterovirus con-
structs to obtain expression of CA16 and
EV71 His-tagged proteins. Next, 2 ml of
recombined plasmid DNA was added to
15 ml pREP4 cells, Following 30 min incu-
bation period on ice, a mixture of pREP4
and viral DNA was placed at 42C for 45 s
(heat shock), then placed back on ice. SOC
media (20 g/l tryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract,
4.8 g/l MgSO4
, 3.603 g/l dextrose, 0.5 g/l
NaCl, 0.186 g/l KCl) was added and the
transformed cells were incubated at 37C for
30 min with agitation. For production of
recombinant fusion protein, the inserted
clones were incubated in Luria broth base
medium with added ampicillin (50 mg/ml) at
37C to reach a density of 0.5 in OD600
, then
protein expression was induced with 1 mM
isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside.
Following culture of transfected E. coli,
His-tagged recombinant proteins were pur-
ified using Ni-NTA resin (Genscript, Hong
Kong, China). The proteins were eluted
with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride buffer
(pH 7.9), then precipitated with trichloro-
acetic acid. Fractions containing the protein
were identified by sodium dodecyl sulphate
(SDS)­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE). The proteins were renatured by
serial dialysis into 1Âphosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)-0.25 M arginine buffer (pH
8.0), and protein purity was analysed by
SDS­PAGE. Concentrations of the purified
viral proteins were determined using a
Beckman Coulter DU730 spectropho-
tometer (Beckman Coulter Commercial
Enterprise (China) Co., Ltd. Shanghai,
China).
Protein microarray
The purified EV71 VP1, EV71 VP3, CA16
VP1 and CA16 VP3 viral proteins in
1ÂPBS-0.25 M arginine buffer, with 30%
glycerol (to prevent evaporation of nano-
droplets) were spotted in quadruplicate, at
1 mg/ml, onto aldehyde group-modified
glass slides. Following spotting, slides were
incubated for 24 h at 4C (to facilitate
complete protein immobilization), then
immobilized. Slides were then blocked with
5% bovine serum antigen (BSA) for 2 h at
37C, then washed three times with 1ÂPBS
(pH 7.4) for 30 s each wash. Serum samples
(1 ml) from patients with HFMD and con-
trols were diluted 20Âin blocking buffer
(0.5% BSA in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20, pH 7.4) and hybridized for
30 min at 37C. Samples were then washed
twice with PBS-Tween 20 (PBST) with a
final rinse using PBS. For detecting IgG
antibody, 10ml of cyanine (Cy)3-labelled
goat antihuman IgG (1 : 1000, KPL,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added.
For detecting IgM antibody, 10ml of
290 Journal of International Medical Research 44(2)
CyTM3-labelled goat antihuman IgM
(1 : 500, KPL) was added. Slides were then
incubated for 30 min at 37C in the dark and
then rinsed twice with washing buffer (PBS-
0.1% Tween-20 [PBST]) and once with H2
O.
Slides were scanned using a GenePixÕ
4000B microarray scanner (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the fluor-
escence acquisition mode. For Cy3-labelled
probes, a 532 nm excitation laser source was
chosen, while the photomultiplier tube volt-
age was set at 500 volts. For scan resolution,
the pixel size was set as 10 mm. The image
was initially analysed using GenePixÕ Pro
microarray acquisition and analysis soft-
ware, version 4.0.1.23 in Array Analysis
mode for absolute fluorescence intensity
measurement. For each slide, a reference
channel image was used to set a grid for
locating an individual spot; fluorescence
readings for each spot were recorded. Raw
data were exported into Microsoft ExcelÕ
for storage and further analysis.
Detection of IgM anti-EV71 VP1 by ELISA
To evaluate the performance of the protein
microarray assay, all serum samples from
patients with HFMD were analysed using
Wantai EV-71 IgM ELISA kits (Beijing
Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the
performance of the Wantai EV-71 IgM
ELISA kits, a random selection of serum
samples from patients with HFMD were
analysed using in-house ELISA assays as
follows: anti-EV71 VP1 IgM was detected
using an IgM m-chain capture ELISA. First,
96-microwell immunoassay strips (Nunc,
USA) were coated with goat antihuman
IgM (m chain- specific, Jackson, USA)
diluted in a carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). The
strip was incubated at 4C overnight, then
washed four times with PBST. Plates were
then blocked with 250 ml of blocking buffer
(PBS, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% BSA (pH
7.4) at room temperature for 4 h before
being washed four times with PBST. Then,
50ml of a 10 Â dilution of the serum speci-
men, blank (dilution buffer; pH 7.4), or
positive (HFMD sample) and negative
(healthy control sample) were each added
to separate wells, and the strips were
incubated at 37C for 1 h. After washing
twice with PBST and final rinse with PBS,
50 ml of purified EV71 VP1-biotin (1 mg/ml)
was added to each well, and samples were
again incubated at 37C for 1 h. Then,
100ml of a 1000Âdilution of horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin
(Chemicon, CA, USA) was added to each
well, the samples were incubated at 37C for
1 h and washed 5 times with PBST, then
3,30,5,50-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)/E
substrate (Chemi-Con, Buena Park, CA,
USA) (100 ml) was added to each well. The
strip was incubated in the dark at room
temperature for 30 min, and the reaction was
terminated by the addition of 100ml 2 N
H2
SO4
. Optical density (OD) was read at
450 nm with a reference filter set to 620 nm
using a Thermo Multiskan Spectrum micro-
plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA).
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
2-test with ZIYUE software, version 1.61
(http://down.tech.sina.com.cn/content/2944
4.html). A P-value < 0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
Results
Preparation of antigenic viral
recombinant proteins
Viral VP1 and VP3 genes from CA16 and
EV71 enteroviruses were cloned into pET-
28a ( þ ) expression vectors. All four con-
structs were confirmed by DNA sequencing
and expressed in E. coli M15 (pREP4). VP1

and VP3 protein products were purified and
analysed as described above. All of the
expressed proteins migrated between the 25
and 37 kDa markers, which was consistent
with the predicted size of each protein
(Figure 1a). All four recombinant proteins
were used to generate the protein
microarray.
Protein microarray
Serum samples from patients with HFMD. A
total of 50 serum samples were collected
from patients with HFMD and tested using
the protein microarray. A signal log ratio
value of 0 was chosen as the cut-off value to
distinguish between positive and negative
test results. A signal log ratio ! 0 was indi-
cative of a positive sample and a ratio <0
was indicative of a negative sample. The
results of signal log ratio analyses were
consistent with unaided observations using
the naked eye. The protein microarrays were
analysed following incubation of serum
from healthy control subjects (Figure 1b)
and from patients with HFMD (Figure 1c).
Anti-EV71VP1 IgM immunoreactivity was
detected in 80% of samples from patients
with HFMD, and was higher than anti-
EV71VP3 IgM, anti-CA16VP1 IgM and
anti-CA16VP3 IgM immunoreactivity
(observed in 40%, 44%, and 20% of sam-
ples, respectively; Table 1). The results of
protein microarray analysis of serum sam-
ples were consistent with the RT­PCR
results performed by the clinical laboratory
prior to enrollment in the present study: The
total positive rate of prior RT­PCR for
EV71 and CA16 were 76% (38/50) and 24%
(12/50), respectively: 35 samples were posi-
tive for EV71 alone and nine samples were
positive for CA16 alone; three samples were
positive for both EV71 and CA16; three
samples were negative for both EV71 and
CA16.
Anti-EV71 IgG and CA16 IgG antibo-
dies were also detected using the protein
microarray. Anti-EV71VP1 IgG, anti-
EV71VP3 IgG, anti-CA16VP1 IgG, and
anti-CA16VP3 IgG immunoreactivity were
detected in 70%, 18%, 72%, and 54% of
serum samples, respectively, from 50

also showed that any sample with immunor-
eactivity for EV71VP3-IgM, CA16VP1-IgM
and CA16VP3-IgM was also positive for
EV71VP1 IgM.
Serum samples from healthy controls. Serum
samples obtained from 30 healthy blood
donors were tested in parallel to evaluate the
specificity of the protein microarray. Anti-
EV71VP1 IgG was detected in nine of 30
samples (30%) and anti-CA16VP1 IgG was
detected in 18/30 samples (60%, Table 1).
Only two samples (6.7%) were positive for
EV71VP3 IgG and one (3.3%) was positive
for CA16VP3 IgG. False-positive reactions
for IgM were not found in healthy serum
samples (Table 1).
IgM capture ELISA results
A total of 20 serum samples from patients
with HFMD were analysed using the in-
house ELISA. An absorbance value 0.2 was
chosen as the cut-off value, thus, an ELISA
value !0.2 was defined as positive. Anti-
EV71VP1 IgM was detected in 13/20
serum samples (65%) from patients with
HFMD and two of the samples were nega-
tive (Table 1).
Thirty-nine of the 50 serum samples from
patients with HFMD (78%) were positive
for EV-71 IgM (Table 1).
Discussion
Protein microarray technology is a powerful
tool for high-throughput assays of protein
expression, protein-protein interaction and
enzyme activity,23,24 and has become an
effective way to diagnose many diseases
because many disease-related proteins are
detectable in serum.25­27
In the present study, antibodies in serum
from patients with HFMD were detected
using four kinds of recombinant antigenic
probes specific for EV71VP1, EV71VP3,
CA16VP1, and CA16VP3, which were

immobilized as capture probes at unique
positions on a slide. The protein microarray
was able to detect neutralizing antibodies
against EV71 and CA16, and to detect IgM
and IgG antibodies against EV71 and CA16
by hybridizing different secondary antibo-
dies. Anti-EV71VP1 IgM was highly detect-
able in serum samples from patients with
HFMD, and almost all anti-VP3-positive
serum samples were also positive for anti-
bodies against VP1 protein. In the present
study, the detection pattern of serum anti-
bodies by protein microarray using entero-
virus VP1 and VP3 proteins as antigens
suggested that the immunological reactions
to VP1 and VP3 of EV71 and CA16 were
different. IgM against VP1 but not VP3
appeared to be generated in patients with
HMFD, which needs to be clarified further.
In the present study, a proportion of
healthy control samples tested positive for
anti-EV71 IgG and anti-CA16 IgG using the
microarray chip, which may have been due
to previous EV71 (and/or CA16) infection.
Levels of IgM antibody increase continu-
ously before peaking at the second week
following symptom onset, then decline grad-
ually.28 During the acute phase (<7 days
following symptom onset), EV71 IgM has
been detected in 88% of samples tested using
ELISA.29 Serum from patients with HFMD
and healthy controls could not be distin-
guished by detecting IgG using microarray
in the present study, however, no commer-
cial ELISA assay was available for detecting
CA16-IgM, EV71-IgG and CA16-IgG. This
meant that appropriate control methods for
CA16-IgM, EV71-IgG and CA16-IgG were
lacking in the present study.
In the present study, anti-EV71 (and/or
CA16) IgM was useful for diagnosing acute
HFMD. Some patients were positive for
both EV71 and CA16, perhaps because
patients with HFMD could be infected
by both EV71 and CA16 concomitantly.
Co-infections with different HFMD patho-
gens have been reported previously.
In Shanghai, co-infection with EV71 and
CA16 was observed in 17.6% of total CA16
cases between 2009 and 2010.30
In the present study, anti-EV71 and
CA16 IgM antibodies were undetected in
10 of 50 samples with the EV71 assay,
perhaps because the antibody titres were
too low for detection at the onset of the
infection.
Studies show that CA16 infected patients
and EV71 infected patients present high
cross-neutralization antibodies against each
other.31,32 Alignment of two (EV71 and
CA16) protein sequences using BLAST
(bl2seq) online (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Blast.cgi) showed that the protein
sequence of EV71 was 77% homologous
with that of CA16 (author's own data). In
the present study, the antibody against
serum EV71 was a polyclonal antibody
which crossreacted with CA16 antigen. The
present data also showed that any sample
that tested positive for CA16 VP1- and
CA16 VP3-IgM was also positive for
EV71-VP1 IgM. Although there are many
methods to detect anti-EV71 or anti-CA16
antibodies, it remains difficult to discrimin-
ate between anti-EV71 or anti-CA16 anti-
bodies in serum.
The protein microarray method used in
the present small study appeared to show
excellent specificity, i.e. no false-positive
results were detected in healthy controls.
The present microarray results (with a posi-
tive rate for EV71-IgM of 80%) compared
favourably with the gold standard ELISA
method of 78% and suggest that the sensi-
tivity of the protein microarray method is at
least equal to, or perhaps slightly higher
than the ELISA. Protein microarray is more
economical than ELISA,33 making its use
potentially more attractive in developing
countries. This small microarray may save
resources such as antibodies, antigens and
other experimental materials, and is a faster
technique compared with ELISA (the pro-
tein microarray takes $1.5 h to detect
294 Journal of International Medical Research 44(2)
multiple antibodies; ELISA takes about 3 h
to detect only one antibody). Protein micro-
array technology, therefore, appears to
allow rapid, easy and parallel detection of
multiple elements in a single assay.
In conclusion, a protein microarray assay
for detecting EV71-IgM in serum samples
from patients with HFMD was developed in
the present study. The protein microarray is
a potential alternative method for detecting
antibodies in serum samples, and as it is
relatively easy to perform and low in cost, it
may be suitable for clinical diagnosis and
use in public health.
