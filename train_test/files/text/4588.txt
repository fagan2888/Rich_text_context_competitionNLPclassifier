Introduction
For many centuries, Islamic discourse in preindependent
Malaysia or what was known as Tanah Melayu or Malaya
was dominated by the traditionalist scholars through their
influence on the religious authority and both formal and
informal Islamic education institutions such as the mosques,
surau, madrasahs, and pondok (Gordon, 1999; Roff, 1962,
1967), which were established resulting from their close
relations with the rulers (Shellabear, 1978; Thomaz, 1993).
The scenario, however, changed in the early 1920s following
the introduction of a modern madrasah system initiated by
young ulama who were mostly graduates of the al-Azhar
University in Egypt (Abdul Hamid, 2010). These al-Azhar
graduates were heavily influenced by the earlier version of
the Salafiyyah1 reform ideology of Jamaldin Afghani and his
disciple, Muhammad Abduh. This version of Salafiyyah
thoughts, propagated among others, the ideal of pan-
Islamism, and the Afghani-Abduh reform doctrine that
emphasizes the importance of reviving the Muslim ummah
globally through its progressive idea of reopening the gate of
ijtihad, relinquishing innovation (bid'a) and reconciling ele-
ments of modernity into the Islamic culture of the people
(Noor, 2004). This earlier version of Salafiyyah, unlike the
current conservative Gulf or Saudi-style Salafiyyah, was
known for its progressive and modern ideas. Lauzière accu-
rately categorizes this version of Salafism as the "reformed
Salafism," although this version of Salafism may share simi-
lar elements with the current Gulf or Saudi-style Salafism in
its epistemological references, but the former is closer to the
ideals of modernity, while the latter is more conservative
(Lauzière, 2010, pp. 369-389; 2015).
The graduates, widely known as Kaum Muda (Young
People), also voiced their resentment toward some of the cul-
tural practices of the Malay community, which, according to
them, were the means to shirik and bid'a (Gordon, 1999;
Othman, 1994; Roff, 1962, 1967). Moreover, in promoting its
"progressive" version of Islam, the Kaum Muda also empha-
sized the importance of modern education, especially for
women. The large number of ideas propagated by Kaum Muda
created an atmosphere of hostility toward the establishment

The Historical Development of the
"Sunnah" Reform Ideology in the State
of Perlis, Malaysia
Maszlee Malik1 and Hamidah Mat2
Abstract
Since the arrival of Islam in Tanah Melayu or Malaya, traditionalist scholars have dominated the Islamic discourse through
their close relations with the rulers (Sultans). Their domination over the religious authorities and the Islamic educational
institutions has shaped the state version of Islam in Malaysia. However, in Perlis, the northernmost state in Malaysia, Middle
Eastern graduate reformists, also known as Kaum Muda, were already preaching the earliest version of Salafism in the early
20th century. They found political patronage from the rulers of the state, hence imposing their version of Islamic teachings
as the prevailing Islamic discourse of the state, which is also known until today as the "Sunnah Perlis" teachings. The widely
presumptuous masses and researchers point that the dominating influence of the reform agenda or "Sunnah" in the state of
Perlis is due to the state authority's patronage based on historical facts that the "Sunnah" itself first emerged in Perlis in the
early 20th century with the blessings of the ruler. This article attempts to look at the historical development of the "Sunnah
Perlis" and to scrutinize the state authority's patronage and influence in the state of Perlis. To achieve this, it employs a
historical method of study to look at important milestones in the historical account of the Sunnah reform agenda in Perlis and
its development at different periods hitherto through literatures, reports, interviews, and focus group discussions.

and resulted in a considerable backlash from the country's reli-
gious authorities (Zakariya, 2008). Many incidents of debates
and clashes are recorded as having occurred between the
Kaum Muda and the establishment. These ended in most
cases, in endless polemics (Means, 2009). Due to its contro-
versial nature, the Kaum Muda was also labeled as the
"Wahabi" (Malik, 2013, pp. 52-56).
Despite the continuous dominance of the traditionalists in
shaping the state version of Islam in many states in Malaysia,
in Perlis, a state located in the northern part of Malaysia,
however, the Kaum Muda managed to gain political patron-
age from the rulers of the state (Othman & Rahmat, 1996).
The state adamantly declared its inclination toward the
reform ideas, and proudly established its own approach
toward understanding Islam, which has been known as the
"Sunnah" way of Islam or, in some cases, coined as "Islah"
(Shukor Mat, 2000). It was known for its call for ijtihad by
referring directly to the Qur'an and Sunnah, that is, without
making any attachment to any specific madhhab (legalistic
school of thought). Consequently, the state religious enact-
ments and rulings were not bound to any madhhab, in con-
trast to the other states in Malaysia, which adhered to the
Shafii madhhab.2
This has been among the most apparent controversial
principle that has caused continuous resentment between the
Kaum Muda of Perlis with mainstream traditionalists from
the other states in Malaysia, which religiously adhere to the
idea of the necessity for Muslims in Malaysia to affiliate
themselves to a specific madhhab, which, in the case of the
Malay Archipelago, is the Shafii madhhab. According to
mainstream traditionalists, any call to liberate oneself from
the madhhab, or any attempt to abolish the affiliation or
attachment of Muslims to a specific madhhab, is similar to
belittling the founder members of those different madhhabs,
and some perceive it as an act of insolence (A. R. Abdullah,
2007; Shukor Mat, 2000). This legacy of the reform agenda
of the "Kaum Muda version of Salafism,"3 which is akin to
Muhammadiyah in Perlis, is also known until today as the
"Sunnah Perlis." They sometimes refer to themselves as the
"golongan sunnah" (Sunnah Group) as an antithesis of the
"golongan madhhabi" (madhhabic group) of the mainstream
(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,
2014).
Interestingly, the Sunnah Perlis scholars and activists
heavily rejected the labeling of Wahabi given to them or any
association with the Wahabi movement in Saudi Arabia.
They always prefer to be known as "Ahli Sunnah wal
jamaah" or "Sunnah" or "Islah" rather than Wahabi (Othman
& Rahmat, 1996, p. 101). However, Man and Ali (2005)
insist in using the "Salafi" label to the "Sunnah Perlis"
thoughts and reform agenda due to its reform nature (islah
and tajdid) and also its call for the pure version of Islam by
referring directly to the al-Quran and Sunnah as well as by
superceding the madhhabic interpretation (p. 75). In sum, to
understand the position of Sunnah Perlis, in contrast to the
mainstream Islamic discourse in Malaysia, one could com-
pare it with the relation between Muhammadiyah and Persis
in Indonesia against the Nahdatul Ulama.
It was widely discussed that the dominating influence of
the "Sunnah" in the state of Perlis was due to the state author-
ity's patronage of the reform agenda. An early hypothesis
indicates that it was the multifactors that led to the situation,
among them was the Rulers' patronage of the "Sunnah"
reformists' agenda, the Rulers' power represented by Majlis
Agama Perlis (religious authority) which is directly under
the Rulers' influence, the state administration represented by
the ruling government predominantly occupied by the
"Sunnah" followers and activists, and the relentless efforts
by "Sunnah" preachers throughout mosques, schools, and
publications (Man, 2007, pp. 141-156). However, the level
of impact by these factors differs from one time to another.
This article will try to look at the historical development
of the "Sunnah Perlis" discourse as another earlier version of
Salafism and scrutinize its influence in the state of Perlis. In
achieving this, it will employ a historical method in under-
standing the important milestones in the historical account of
the Sunnah reform agenda in Perlis and its development in
the different periods hitherto through literatures, reports,
interviews, and focus group discussions. The term "Sunnah"
will be used in this article intertwined with "Islah" as widely
used by other researchers, to maintain the level of objectivity
by calling the idea according to what the proponents call it.
"Sunnah" in Perlis: Historical
Background and Development
Perlis is the smallest state in Malaysia situated at the north-
ern part of the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The capital
of Perlis is Kangar while its royal capital is Arau, where the
Rulers of Perlis reside. It is bordered by the state of Kedah to
the south and Thailand to the north, and was initially part of
Kedah under the Siamese rule for many centuries. However,
in 1842, the Siamese separated Perlis from Kedah and it
became a principality, a vassal to Bangkok. On May 20,
1843, the Siamese made Sayyid Hussain Jamalullail, a
descendent of Hadhrami Arab Sayyid, who was also the
maternal son of the Sultan of Kedah, the first "Raja" of Perlis
(Buyong, 1981, pp. 4-8). This made Perlis a sovereign state.
His descendents still rule Perlis, but as Rajas, instead of
Sultans due to their non-Malay origin.
The "Sunnah" in Perlis, a 20th-century phenomenon, is
part of the global "Islah" or reform movement of the pan-
Islamic agenda of Afghani­Abduh in Egypt. The develop-
ment of the "Sunnah" in Perlis throughout the two centuries
(20th and 21st) can be divided into six phases: the establish-
ment, stagnation, re-enhancement, crisis, recovery-revival,
and the golden periods. The categorization of the periods is
mostly based on Abdul Rahman Abdullah's chapter "Sejarah
Islah di Perlis" (the History of Islah in Perlis) in his book,
"Aliran Dakwah di Malaysia, Satu Titik Pertemuan" (Dakwah
Malik and Mat 3
Trends in Malaysia: A Meeting Point) (see A. R. Abdullah,
2007, pp. 161-173). However, an additional period has been
inserted into this article, the "Golden Period" of the "Sunnah,"
which occurred during the term of Shahidan Kassim as the
Menteri Besar together with his "Sunnah" acquaintance and
reference, Dr. Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin as the Mufti of the
State of Perlis. The word "golden" was not elaborated by
Abdul Rahman, though he did mention it briefly when talking
about the final stage of the recovery-revival period. Thus, he
is not really being just to the historical facts.
Establishment Period (1920s-1930s)
There are a few theories on who was first responsible for
bringing the "Sunnah" reform idea to Perlis. However,
according to many researchers, it was Lebai Kechik who
came to Perlis from Padang in the year 1925. Man (2007)
argues that this wide-spread theory must have been taken
from personal notes called "Agama dan Zakat di Perlis,"
widely quoted by researchers, which belongs to Dato' Wan
Ahmad b. Wan Daud, a prominent "Sunnah" figure in Perlis
(p. 148). However, Shukor Mat (2000), who managed to
trace the date of Lebai Kechik's arrival in Malaya, which was
during the 1930s, has refuted this theory. According to
Shukor Mat, the first attempt to bring the "Sunnah" idea was
by Syeikh Hassan Sarbani, known by his real name as Syeikh
Hassan b. Ahmad, who came to Perlis from Surabaya in
1916. However, he was chased away by Raja Alwi due to the
controversial nature of his thoughts, and he later migrated to
Johore and Pulau Pinang accordingly. Despite the failure of
his first attempt in Perlis, he made his return to the state in
1926 and managed to get full support from a local religious
scholar, Haji Abdul Ghani b. Dato' Sakti, and a well-known
community leader, Tuan Haji Abdullah b. Ahmad.
Wan Ahmad (n.d), in his account on the emergence of the
"Sunnah" idea in Perlis, suggests that a scholar from
Hadramawt, Yemen, Syed Ibrahim also made his contribu-
tion in spreading the reform idea in Perlis. However, accord-
ing to historical records, it was Haji Ahmad bin Muhammad,
also known as Haji Ahmad Hakim, who was the first person
responsible to propose a radical change to the conventional
practice of zakat collection and distribution in Perlis as part
of the reform proposal to Raja Alwi in 1927 (A. R. Abdullah,
2007). This incident was the turning point that led to the
positive attitude of the palace toward the reform ideas in reli-
gious matters, despite waves of rejection from the tradition-
alist local scholars. It also opened a new chapter in the
support of the palace to the struggle of the reform idea later
known as the "Sunnah" or the "Ahlu Sunnah wal-Jamaah"
method.
Haji Ahmad Hakim was supported by two comrades: a
political figure, Wan Ahmad bin Wan Daud, and a local
scholar, Syeikh Ahmad bin Mohd Hashim, to spread the
reform idea (islah) in Perlis (A. R. Abdullah, 1997). Among
the three, Wan Ahmad was known for his proactive role in
promoting the "Sunnah" or "Islah" among the authority, thus
getting the support from the palace. He was reported to have
established communication and relation with the Kaum
Muda icon, Syed Syeikh al-Hadi, in Penang and succeeded
in getting Abdul Wahab Abdullah, the assistant editor of
"Saudara" magazine which belonged to al-Hadi to Penang.
In disseminating its ideas, Kaum Muda managed to vary its
approach. It published its literature and was also aggres-
sively involved in publishing its own periodical newspa-
per--akin to its ideologue in Egypt. Saudara, Pengasuh,
"al-Urwat al-Wuthqa," al-Ikhwan, al-Imam, and al-Munir
are among the periodicals produced by these reformists
(Othman & Rahmat, 1996, pp. 28-30, 81). Similarly, Abdul
Wahab had a significant role in spreading the Kaum Muda
ideas in Perlis.
Wan Ahmad and his two comrades are known in the Perlis
Sunnah history as "Tiga Mat" (the three Mats;A. R.Abdullah,
1997, p. 219). They are identified as having been heavily
influenced by the writings of Hassan Bandung from
Persatuan Islam (PERSIS), one of the reform movements of
that period in Indonesia. Apart from the "Tiga Mat," another
noteworthy scholar who contributed toward establishing the
"Sunnah" idea in Perlis was Abu Bakar al-Ashaari, an Azhar
graduate (1925-1932), and a former active leader of a student
movement "Jam'iyat al-Malayuwiyah" (Malay Association),
which consists of students from Malaya and Indonesia in
Egypt along with the prominent Indonesian reformist leader,
Abdul Kahar Muzakkir.Akin to the other reformists of Kaum
Muda during his time, al-Ashaari also contributed signifi-
cantly to the "Saudara" magazine while teaching in Pulau
Pinang. The "Tiga Mat" invited al-Ashaari to Perlis together
with Abdul Wahab. He began his career in Perlis as a teacher
at the Alawiyah madrasah but was later given a more sub-
stantive role as the Imam of the Alawi mosque in Kangar (A.
R. Abdullah, 2007).
It was the collective effort of the "Tiga Mat," Abdul
Wahab and al-Ashaari, that managed to place a foundational
pillar to the teaching of the "Sunnah" or "Islah" in Perlis in
what is coined by Abdul Rahman as the "Establishment
Period" (A. R. Abdullah, 2007, p. 173). It was during this
"establishment period" that the Alawiyah Madrasah and the
Alwi mosque became the propagation bastion of the reform-
ists, together with their writings, especially those of Abu
Bakar al-Ashaari. Among the factors that paved the wave for
the "Sunnah" reform idea to spread throughout Perlis, espe-
cially in Kangar and Arau, was the full support they received
from the religious authority and the palace. Raja Syed Alwi,
the king of Perlis, was known for his open support for the
reform ideas and the influence of the "Tiga Mat."
Stagnation Period (1941-1945)
The honeymoon of the Sunnah reformists did not last long;
the Japanese Occupation ended the privileges enjoyed by
them. They appointed Syed Hamzah, brother of Raja Alwi,
4 SAGE Open
as the new ruler on February 2, 1943. Syed Hamzah was
known for his disagreement with the former king, SyedAlwi,
and his aides, the Sunnah reformists. He began to exclude all
those who were associated with the former ruler and kept
them away from any administrative post in the state. Most of
the Sunnah reformists, apart from Syeikh Ahmad, went
through a tough time and were pressured to abandon their
reformation agenda during the occupation period. Syed
Hamzah also appointed those without inclination toward the
"Sunnah" reform ideas to lead the religious authority admin-
istration and consistently expressed his resentment toward
the "Sunnah" reform idea, which he called as "deviant teach-
ing" (A. R. Abdullah, 2007, pp. 178-181).
An interesting fact to ponder regarding this period relates
to the situation of the other Kaum Muda or pro-Kaum Muda
activists outside Perlis. The Japanese organized the "Pan-
Malayan Religious Council" which aimed to put Muslim
scholars, mainly from the religious authority (dominated by
the traditionalists or Kaum Tua) in the Malay states under its
patronage. Most of them were used by the Japanese to spread
Japanese propaganda at the mosques to the Muslim commu-
nity throughout preindependent Malaya (Ahmad, 2003).
The Japanese managed to get the support of the Muslim
scholars by using "anti-colonial" discourse and promised
them "independence" from Western colonization. The Kaum
Muda scholars outside Perlis, in the meantime, became
staunch supporters of the Japanese through their political
ideas. Although they were not used by the Japanese to be part
of religious propaganda machine like the Kaum Tua, the
Kaum Muda scholars, thinkers, and political activists formed
the Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) to express their anti-
British propaganda and propagate the idea of a bigger Malay
state comprising Malaya and Indonesia, or what was then
known as "Melayu Raya" (K. Abdullah, 2003, p. 43).
Unfortunately, unlike the other Kaum Muda scholars who
were not affected by Japanese policies, the Sunnah scholars
were experiencing an eclipse for an internal palace-political
power struggle in Perlis.
Re-Enhancement Period (1945-1960s)
The predicament experienced by the "Sunnah" reformists,
however, ended with the end of the Japanese occupation. The
British colonialists who came back to Malaya after the defeat
of the Japanese in the Second World War appointed Syed
Putra as the new king of Perlis on December 4, 1945. Syed
Putra took a different approach toward the Sunnah reform
idea. His openness and positive attitude toward the Sunnah
reformists allowed them to make a comeback to finish their
unfinished business in the state. Furthermore, the Sunnah
reform agenda was fully supported by the ruling party
`United Malays National Organization'(UMNO) as the lead-
ing and the most prevailing Malay party after the Japanese
occupation and the rejection of the Malays of the "Malayan
Union" proposal by the British to unify all the Malay states
under a single government to simplify administration (K.
Abdullah, 2003, p. 183). The proposal was perceived as an
attempt to abolish the monarchy, thus endangering Malay
dominance of their motherland.
The golden opportunity given to the Sunnah reformists
during this period was capitalized by "Tiga Mat" and its
acquaintances to regroup and pursue its reform agenda more
aggressively. They managed to strengthen the Sunnah reform
agenda by employing only those with Sunnah tendency to
positions in the state religious authority offices: Imams for
the mosques and teachers in the madrasahs throughout
Perlis. The religious authority also emphasized the enforce-
ment and monitoring issues to ensure the Sunnah practice
was substantively installed and implemented by the people
of Perlis and all the religious institutions within the state of
Perlis (M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August
25, 2014). Majlis Agama Islam (State religious authority)
had also appointed the religious inspectors to monitor reli-
gious activities conducted by the people (State of Perlis,
1945).
Apart from the authority's enforcement and support given
by the palace, education and propagation also played an
essential role in spreading the Sunnah reform idea in the state
of Perlis. At this stage, considerable effort in propagating the
Sunnah idea is attributed to Abu Bakar al-Ashaari, who was
brought back by Haji Ahmad Hakim after his exile outside
Perlis during the Japanese occupation. He was appointed ini-
tially as Imam of Masjid Alwi (Alwi mosque), which was
pivotal to the proliferation of the Sunnah reform idea in
Kangar and Perlis. Being a prolific writer, and considered as
the most learned scholar in Perlis, he became the reference of
the Sunnah idea by both the authority and the people of Perlis
(Roff, 1975). His books have been considered as references
for the Sunnah, and used by many to understand the "Sunnah"
ideals.4 Despite the enormous influence of his books to the
people of Perlis, many of which, especially his "Ibadat
Rasulullah," were being prohibited and banned in the other
states due to its nonconventional madhhabic approach and
controversial fatwas in contradiction with the mainstream
Shafii madhhab throughout Persekutuan Tanah Melayu then
(A. R. Abdullah, 2007, p. 186).
At this stage, Perlis was already known for its "Sunnah"
inclination and its controversial scholars. Abu Bakar al-
Ashaari, one of those scholars, was invited to many Malay
states by the religious authority, muftis and scholars to engage
in debate on many of his fatwa, mainly from his "Ibadat
Rasulullah" (A. R.Abdullah, 2007, p. 186). In most instances,
Abu Bakar refused the invitation as he believed the result
would be fruitless. He argues that everybody is entitled to his
own ijtihad (reasoning) because his fatwas mainly deal with
elementary issues and not those of the fundamentals of Islam
(Din, 1976). Surprisingly, some of his controversial fatwas
became popular and acceptable in the later period, such as
his fatwa on the permissibility of organ (he was talking about
eyes) donation from a dead person to a living person (A. R.
Malik and Mat 5
Abdullah, 2007, p. 188). He backed his fatwa with the argu-
ment of maslahah (public interest) that has always been pro-
tected and prioritized in Islamic teachings as mercy to
humankind. Similarly, his fatwa on the permissibility for
Muslims to pay zakat (alms) with money instead of crops
and fruits was heavily refuted and led him to be labeled as a
heretic, yet it is now widely accepted and practiced by
Muslims in Malaysia (A. R. Abdullah, 2007).
Crisis Period (1960s)
Having Abu Bakr al-Ashaari as the icon of the "Sunnah" in
Perlis brought both fortune and calamity to the reform
agenda. As mentioned earlier, most of the Sunnah reformists
in Perlis were UMNO supporters. Since the preindependent
years until the postindependent period, the "Sunnah" reform
agenda has been wholeheartedly propagated and defended
by those who are within or related to UMNO unlike in the
other states in Malaya. The establishment of the Pan-
Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS; as the offshoot of the first
Islamic party in Malaya Hizbul Muslimun) in 1955 became a
turning point of the status quo. Initially, PAS had managed to
attract most of the scholars from both the Kaum Muda influ-
enced intellectuals and the Kaum Tua traditionalist scholars
from throughout Malaya. PAS presented itself as different
from UMNO through its goal to establish an Islamic State
based on an Islamic ideology instead of a secular-nationalis-
tic one as propagated by UMNO.
Furthermore, in 1956, Dr. Burhanuddin al-Helmy, the
prominent Kaum Muda and reform intellect, was appointed
as PAS new president due to the leadership crisis within the
party (Noor, 2004). Dr. Burhanuddin, during his presidency,
made the party more dynamic, thus attracting the other Kaum
Muda and reform-minded scholars. Abu Bakar al-Ashaari
was among those who was convinced by Dr. Burhanuddin. A
year after Burhanuddin became the president of PAS, Abu
Bakar left UMNO for PAS, and eventually became Ketua
Dewan Ulama (Leader of Scholars Council) of PAS in Perlis.
His migration to PAS led to division among the Sunnah sup-
porters in Perlis (A. R. Abdullah, 2007). Abu Bakar, since
then, has not been known for his Sunnah ideal, and has been
accused of being apologetic of his position to compromise
with the other Kaum Tua traditionalists within PAS in Perlis
(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,
2014).
Unlike Abu Bakar, most of the Sunnah leaders and activ-
ists in Perlis have remained loyal to UMNO, thus enjoying
administrative and political status in the state administration
(Othman & Rahmat, 1996). Haji Ahmad Hakim continued
his job as the Yang Dipertua Majlis Agama Islam and Adat
Istiadat Melayu Perlis (the head of Religious Council and
Malay Culture and Heritage of the state of Perlis), while both
Wan Ahmad and Syeikh Ahmad contested for UMNO in the
1959 General Election in Malaya. Both won the seats as
assemblymen in the state assembly. Following their victory,
Wan Ahmad was appointed as the assembly hall speaker
while Syeikh Ahmad became the first elected Menteri Besar
(Chief Minister) of Perlis. Despite the special treatment
given to the Sunnah propagation in Perlis, however, not
much essential changes were made during the tenure of
Syeikh Ahmad as the Menteri Besar.
The most significant milestone of the Sunnah Perlis
occurred before the period of Syeikh Ahmad's predecessor
as the Menteri Besar, Dato Laksamana Haji Mohd Razali.
On March 26, 1959, the Sunnah ideology was duly enacted
in the state constitution (Undang-Undang Tubuh Kerajaan
Perlis) with the endorsement of various parties involved
(which includes the Tiga Mat, the Menteri Besar, and the
King's representative). Article 17 of the state constitution
states clearly that "the Ruler of Perlis must be a Muslim man
who adheres to the Ahli Sunnah Wal Jamaah thoughts."
While inArticle 3:1, it states that any regent to the throne and
the council of the regent must "adhere to the teachings of
Ahli Sunnah Wal Jamaah." Concurrently, Article 27 of the
state constitution also states that "the heir of the throne must
also adhere to Ahli Sunnah Wal Jamaah" (Undang-Undang
Tubuh Kerajaan Perlis (Perlis State Constitution),
1381/1962). The enactments have been acknowledged ever
since as the cornerstone and the triumph of the struggle of the
"Sunnah" ideology in Perlis.
During the period of Syeikh Ahmad as Menteri Besar,
more substantive achievements to strengthen the domination
of the "Sunnah" in Perlis were achieved. In 1963, as an
example, the Islamic Administrative Laws (Undang-Undang
Pentadbiran Agama Islam) indicate in Article 4 that "The
Majlis (Religious Council of the state) in issuing a Fatwa
and the Shari'ah (Fatwa) Committee when giving its opin-
ion under sub-section (2) shall follow al-Quran and/or
Sunnah." Consequently, in 1964, an amendment was made to
the Article 5(1) of the Perlis state constitution (Undang-
Undang Tubuh Kerajaan Perlis) stating, "The official reli-
gion of the state of Perlis is Islam according to the teaching
of Ahli Sunnah Wal-Jamaah as being practiced in the state."
Similarly, in the same year, a significant amendment was
done to the state Islamic Administrative Laws (Undang-
Undang Pentadbiran Agama Islam), in Article 2, para. 7 (4),
stating that any fatwa or decision by the Shari'ah council of
the state that follows al-Quran and Sunnah must not contra-
dict with the public interest. While in case of any contradic-
tions, the decision must be presented to the King who will
decide according to the convention practiced in Perlis.
Despite the law enactments, the late 1960s and early
1970s became witness to the demise of many "Sunnah"
icons in Perlis. This situation left the "Sunnah" reform
agenda in a relatively state of loss. Haji Ahmad Hakim died
in circa 1964, Abu Bakar al-Ashaari in 1970, the same year
as Wan Ahmad. The last "Mat" of the "Tiga Mat" (three
Mats), Syeikh Ahmad died years later, in 1980, however,
without making any significant contribution in his final years
compared with the 1950s (A. R. Abdullah, 2007, p. 199).

Furthermore, in 1967, the Government of Malaysia, through
the Ministry of Education, started to gain control of some
madrasahs in Malaysia, including the Madrasah Alawiyah in
Perlis, once the bastion of the "Sunnah" activists, to educate
the younger generation of scholars. After the takeover,
Madrasah Alawiyah no longer used the "Sunnah" curricu-
lum they were once proud of, but instead had to resort to the
standardized Ministry of Education schools' religious sylla-
bus, which is mainly based on the Shafi'i madhhab (A. R.
Abdullah, 2007, p. 200; Othman & Rahmat, 1996, pp.
118-119).
In addition, the "Sunnah" reform agenda in Perlis began to
deteriorate when the appointment to the main positions of reli-
gious authority was made by the federal government, and no
longer under the state's jurisdiction. Most of those who were
deployed to Perlis from outside the state were not really
friendly to the "Sunnah" approach, and in some cases appeared
as the opponents to the state religious ideology such as Salleh
Othman who was appointed as the Yang Dipertua Majlis
Agama Islam Perlis (Head of Higher Islamic Council of the
state of Perlis) on January 1, 1971, Mohd Said Pilus who suc-
ceeded him, and finally, Ghazali Haji Ismail who came after
Mohd Said in 1976. The "Sunnah" followers in Perlis saw the
aforementioned three Yang Dipertuas as persons who had
been sent by the federal authority to change the "Sunnah"
reform agenda in Perlis and replace it with the mainstream
Shafi'i madhhab approach (A. R. Abdullah, 2007, pp. 200-
201). This suspicion was strengthened when during those
years, the federal Islamic authority aggressively banned litera-
tures relating to the "Sunnah" such as the writings of Hasan
Bandung, Abu Bakar al-Ashaari, and others (M. S. Md Ismail,
personal communication, August 25, 2014).
The Recovery-Revival Period (1980s)
Despite the eclipse that happened to the "Sunnah" in Perlis in
the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new wave of "Sunnah"
awakening emerged during the mid-1970s and 1980s. New
icons with a new approach of enhancing the "Sunnah"
agenda were initiated by a group of religious teachers and
preachers who established a niche Non-Governmental
Organization (NGO) called "al-Islah Perlis." This was led
by Tuan Haji Ismail bin Haji Mahmud, widely known in
Perlis as Syeikh Noor al-Surur. Syeikh Noor, of Hadramawt
origin who was a religious teacher and a judge in the High
Court of Makkah for 8 years before he came to Malaysia. He
moved to Perlis with the purpose to be part of the "Sunnah"
reform activists in the state during the 1950s (A. R. Abdul
Rahman, personal communication, August 17, 2012).
Nevertheless, he remained low profile as a religious teacher
teaching at several religious schools in Perlis. However, the
demise of the "Sunnah" icons prompted him to play his role
as a reference for "Sunnah" thoughts, which were widely
accepted by the "Sunnah" followers (A. R. Abdul Rahman,
personal communication, August 17, 2012).
Together with Abu Bakar Mahmud and Haji Abdullah Ali,
Syeikh Noor founded "al-Islah Perlis" on March 18, 1971.
Syeikh Noor's disciples, later known as the al-Islah leaders
and preachers such as Ustaz Abdul Razak bin Abd Rahman,
Dato Wan Ahmad Wan Abdullah, Hj Abd Rashid Jasin,
Ahmad Yusuf Amin (Mat Libya), and others came to lend
their hands to uphold the "Sunnah" agenda through al-Islah
(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,
2014). Al-Islah also managed to attract a former Mufti of
Perlis, Abdul Rahman Haji Ismail, who was then a teacher at
Madrasah Alawiyah Arau. He eventually became the Imam
of Masjid Alwi (Alwi mosque) in Kangar as part of his efforts
to maintain the "Sunnah" practice at the mosque (A. R.
Abdullah, 2007). Apart from the enormous efforts of the
"Sunnah" activists through al-Islah in spreading the
"Sunnah" practice, the state government also contributed
significantly toward al-Islah's activities. The then Perlis
Menteri Besar, Datuk Ali Haji Ahmad, became part of al-
Islah's leadership and made his presence in al-Islah to
strengthen the ties between al-Islah and the state administra-
tion (S. Kassim, personal communication, July 26, 2014).
Furthermore, the palace had also given its recognition to
al-Islah and occasionally officiated al-Islah's activities,
especially its landmark events, the first Ijtimak Sunnah in
1986 and the second Ijtimak Sunnah in 1988.5 The palace,
through the King, Raja Syed Sirajudin, who was also the
Yang Dipertua Majlis Agama Islam Perlis, came to defend
the state religious authority. The Shari'ah council's decision
was made according to the "Sunnah" method, which was
considered controversial to others and often received criti-
cism from outside Perlis. Due to the role played by the King
toward the "Sunnah" enforcement, al-Islah maintained its
support to the palace and valued its position in enhancing the
survival of "Sunnah" in the state. Despite its existence as an
NGO, al-Islah was also actively involved in strengthening
the position of the state religious authority in issuing any
fatwa, enforcing certain "Sunnah" practices and spreading
the teachings of the "Sunnah" through any state institutions
(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,
2014).
Similarly, the Perlis Menteri Besar, Hamid Pawanteh,
who came after Datuk Ali Haji Ahmad also promised his
commitment to adhere to the "Sunnah" and to lend his sup-
port to any cause related to the "Sunnah" in his speech given
at the second Ijtimak Sunnah (A. R. Abdullah, 2007, p. 205).
Hamid was also proud of being a "Sunnah" follower and a
Menteri Besar of a "Sunnah" state. Furthermore, Hamid
Pawanteh also believed that the "Sunnah" in Perlis was
dependent on UMNO. To him, for as long as UMNO still
runs the state government of Perlis, the "Sunnah" will be
maintained as the state religious ideology (Othman &
Rahmat, 1996, pp. 123-124). However, according to
Shahidan Kassim, the Menteri Besar who succeeded him,
Hamid Pawanteh indeed had done something for the Sunnah
during his period as Menteri Besar, but it was not enough
Malik and Mat 7
compared with the state administrative power he held during
his tenure (S. Kassim, personal communication, July 26,
2014). Shahidan's claim is relatively true if one compares the
achievements between the "Sunnah" propagation and the
enforcement implemented during Shahidan's time as Menteri
Besar and with what happened during Hamid Pawanteh's
tenure. This will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs
on the "Golden Years of `Sunnah' Perlis."
The arrival of Saudi-Salafism to Perlis.The early arrival of
Saudi-Salafism to Perlis took place during the period of
Islamic revivalism stretching from the 1970s until the 1990s
(see Abdul Hamid, 2002; Zakaria, 1997). Within the context
of the Middle Eastern oil boom of the 1970s and the ensuing
rise of the political clout of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi petrodollars started
pouring into many Muslim countries worldwide through the
Saudi embassies for the propagation of Islam and the spread
of the Saudi-Salafi indoctrination process. It is historically
an undeniable fact that Malaysia became a major recipient of
oil-related aid distributed under the aegis of the Jeddah-
based Islamic Development Bank (IDB; Idris, 2006; Yaakop
& Idris, 2010).
Likewise, in many countries where Saudi embassies were
established, an Islamic Cultural Council (al-Mustashar al-
thaqafi) was also set up, designed specifically for the pur-
pose of Islamic propagation. In addition, it also employed
local graduates from Saudi universities to become its official
preachers in spreading the teachings of Islam. Among the
well-known preachers employed by the Saudi Arabian
Embassy Cultural Council in Malaysia at that time were
Abdullah Yassin, Zainal Abidin, Hussin Yee, and Sulaiman
Nordin (A. Yassin, personal communication, March 17,
2014).
Accordingly, a few Saudi-based and Saudi government-
supported da'wah (propagation) organizations were also
actively engaged with the Islamic organizations in Malaysia
(Idris, 2006). The World Association of Muslim Youths
(WAMY), Rabitah al-'Alam al-Islami (also known as
Rabitah) and others were among active bodies running
Islamic propagation according to the Saudi-Salafism doc-
trine either through the Islamic Council or by direct commu-
nication with Islamic organizations, especially the Muslims
Youth Organization or "Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia
(ABIM) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Islamic
Council, WAMY, and Rabitah were also actively involved in
distributing free translated and nontranslated copies of al-
Quran to mosques, organizing free Hajj and Umrah trips for
selected Islamic organizations and student leaders, dissemi-
nating literature related to the teachings of Saudi-Salafism as
well as sponsoring Islamic and da'wah events across the
country including Perlis (M. Nur Manuty, personal commu-
nication, June 1, 2013).
Similarly, the Islamic Council also acted as a reference
point for local students to pursue their studies at the higher
institutions of learning in Saudi Arabia such as the Islamic
University of Madinah, Ummul Qura University in Mecca,
and others (A. B. Abdul Rahman, personal communication,
March 17, 2014). In this sense, those who returned from
Saudi Arabian universities6 played an important role in rein-
stating the Saudi-Salafism discourse in Perlis, especially in
the 1980s and 1990s. It was during the years 1992 to 1994
that the state of Perlis started to initiate its official relation
with the Saudi Arabian embassy and its cultural office in
Kuala Lumpur through its Pengarah Majlis Agama Islam
Perlis, Md Sadik Md Ismail. It was through this official com-
munication that the state managed to get its students to secure
scholarships to study in Saudi Arabian universities, mainly at
the Islamic University of Madinah. It was through this rela-
tion too that many Saudi preachers were given the opportu-
nity to deliver their lessons and talks in Perlis.
However, according to Md Sadik, his personal relation
with the embassy started since 1986 to 1987 through the
Islamic councillor of the Saudi Arabian Cultural Office in
Jalan U-Thant, Dr. Abdul Rahman Ghannam, who was
invited on a monthly basis to Perlis to deliver talks organized
by al-Islah (M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication,
August 25, 2014). Other local preachers who worked with
the Islamic Councillor of Saudi Arabia in Kuala Lumpur also
frequently reported coming to Perlis to give lessons and talks
such as Dr. Abdullah Yassin and Ustaz Sofwan Badri (U.
Safwan Badri, personal communication, March 17, 2014).
Nevertheless, despite the relation, and the space given to
Saudi-Salafism preachers in Perlis, Sunnah Perlis did not
transform or evolve into the doctrine of Saudi-Salafism. In
fact, some of the younger Saudi-Salafi preachers among the
graduates of Saudi Arabian universities after the year 2000
perceived that Sunnah Perlis did not embrace the Saudi-
Salafism doctrine or what they coined as "manhaj Salafi"
(Salafi method). As a result, most of these preachers estab-
lished their own influence different from the mainstream
Sunnah Perlis as propagated by the state religious authority
(M. S. Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25,
2014).
The Golden Period ("Sunnah" Perlis Under
Shahidan Kasim)
According to many veterans of "Sunnah" in Perlis, as quoted
by Md Sadik Md Ismail, the former Pengarah Majlis Agama
Islam Perlis (Director of Islamic Council of the state of
Perlis; 1992-1994) and the former al-Islah activist, the most
intensive and lively period of the "Sunnah" in Perlis since
the 1950s was during the tenure of Datuk Seri Dr. Shahidan
Kassim as the Menteri Besar, specifically when he was close
friends with Dr. Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, an academic from
Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) or Malaysia Science
University. The pinnacle of the golden period was seen by
many as during Mohd Asri's period in office as the Mufti of
the state of Perlis. The Ruler of Perlis, King Syed Sirajudin,
8 SAGE Open
with the recommendation from Shahidan on November 1,
2006, appointed Mohd Asri as the state Mufti. It was since
then that the Shahidan-Mohd Asri symbiosis managed to put
the "Sunnah" back as the jewel of the Perlis state crown,
once again becoming the trademark of the state itself.
In adding more substantive "Sunnah" legacy to the state,
Shahidan went a step further by changing the name of the
state from Perlis "Indera Kayangan" (which literally means:
heavenly sense) to Perlis "Darul Sunnah" (Abode of the
Sunnah; Utusan Malaysia, 2006). However, the name "Darul
Sunnah" was never officially promulgated to be the official
name for Perlis until today. Similarly, in defending the
"Sunnah" of Perlis, Shahidan often appeared in the media
talking about "Sunnah," Islah, and the need to return to the
true practice of Islam as according to al-Quran and Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad (S. Kassim, personal communica-
tion, July 26, 2014). Furthermore, in reviving the "Sunnah"
practice, Shahidan Kassim was himself involved in the
implementation done congregationally especially during the
month of Ramadhan throughout Perlis (M. S. Md Ismail,
personal communication, August 25, 2014). He was known
for his generosity and his habit of distributing donations to
all those who attended events and programs organized where
he himself was present (M. A. Zainul Abidin, personal com-
munication, July 29, 2014). In terms of the continuity of edu-
cation for the people of Perlis on the "Sunnah," Shahidan
established "Institut Sunnah Negeri Perlis" (Perlis Sunnah
Institute) with the aim to introduce the true teachings of
Islam according to the "Sunnah" to all Perlis residents, both
Muslims and non-Muslims. Associate Professor Zulkifli
Abidin, a former academic, was given the responsibility to
lead the institute ("Pusat Sunnah di Nusantara," 2007).
There are few factors that made the Shahidan-Mohd Asri
period comparatively unique from the other periods dis-
cussed. The development of the "Sunnah" in Perlis at this
time was supported by young people, not only in Perlis but
also outside the state. The media coverage of sensational
news and events too had its impact in getting information
about the "Sunnah" known to people throughout Malaysia.
The media, when referring to religious matters, often quoted
statements made by both Shahidan and Mohd Asri. This gave
them the limelight; thus, whatever issues regarding the
"Sunnah" they were trying to promote were publicized
through the media. Furthermore, the social media revolution
in mid-2000, especially the blogs, web forums, and advance
version of email groups, had made discussions on religious
issues a public matter (Malik, 2015). The "Sunnah" issue
was also becoming a hot topic of discussion, especially with
the emergence of the Global Salafism influence through the
Internet.
In addition, the Global Salafism influence that was widely
spread through the Internet since the Internet revolution
before the beginning of the new millennia had contributed
significantly in giving more information on all aspects of
various issues to the younger generation (Malik, 2013).
Notable websites famously propagated Salafism during this
period, contributing to the spread of Salafi teachings directly
and indirectly to college students, young middle-class gradu-
ates as well as in the educated circles. Among those websites
were al-Ahkam.net, al-qayyim.net, ehadith.info, alFikrah.
net, al-firdaus.com, al-nidaa.com, al-wahidah.com,
Darulkautsar.com, and Indonesian salafy.or.id, apart from
the personal website of the mufti of Perlis himself, "drmaza.
com" (Ashaari, 2010, pp. 35-49). These websites had approx-
imately 1.5 million viewers (A. K. Ishak, personal communi-
cation, August 28, 2015).
Despite the difference between the current Global
Salafism thoughts and the Perlis "Sunnah," the foundation
and the methods in understanding Islam of the two, how-
ever, are still similar. This led some conventional Salafists
to strongly accept the Perlis "Sunnah" as part of Salafism
but with caution and exceptions. Another factor was the fre-
quent open polemics and direct attacks by the opponent of
Salafism on the "Sunnah" practices in Perlis which they
often equated with Salafism and Wahabism, thus publicizing
it to those who might never have heard of it (A. R. Abdullah,
2007, p. 208). As a response, the convincing academic
styled refutation by Mohd Asri to the "Sunnah" opponents
appeared more appealing especially to the middle-class and
educated Muslims.
Among the triumphs of the "Sunnah" reform agenda dur-
ing this period was its ability to expand beyond the Perlis
border. The support given and attendance of the "Sunnah"
events in Perlis were not confined to the people of Perlis.
Due to the popularity of the controversial Mohd Asri on the
mainstream and social media, most of the events involving
him as a speaker were often attended by outsiders from as far
as Singapore. Mohd Asri was also able to invite his like-
minded scholar friends from all over Malaysia and overseas
to help him in educating the people of Perlis about the
"Sunnah." Among the landmark events during Mohd Asri's
period as the Mufti of the state were "Seminar Antarabangsa
Syeikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab" (International Seminar
on Syeikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab) on March 16 and
17, 2006; Minggu Sunnah Kebangsaan (National Sunnah
Week) on March 11 to 16, 2007; and Ijtimak Sunnah (a con-
tinuation of the previous al-Islah's legacy) on November 28
and 29, 2008. Apart from the mentioned seminars, the state
government also actively organized a series of seminars for
government servants and other related agencies on Islamic
issues (M. A. Zainul Abidin, personal communication, July
29, 2014).
Similarly, Mohd Asri himself went regularly to mosques
in Perlis to ensure that they were abiding with the regulations
promulgated by the Majlis Agama as part of his enforcement
"approach" (M. K. A. Abdul Latif, personal communication,
March 17, 2014). In addition, the office of the Mufti was also
involved in organizing the "Ihya Masjid" (Reviving the
Mosques), where selected mosques were chosen to organize
fast-breaking feasts every Monday and Thursday followed
Malik and Mat 9
by religious talks given by Mohd Asri himself or any other
religious officer on duty (M. K. A. Abdul Latif, personal
communication, March 17, 2014).
Mohd Asri and Shahidan Kassim also maintained strong
existing ties between the state of Perlis and the SaudiArabian
Islamic Councillor in Kuala Lumpur. Mohd Asri was consid-
ered an authority in giving recommendations to Malaysian
applicants who wished to pursue their studies at the Saudi
Arabian universities under the funding of the Saudi govern-
ment. Perlis too became a favorite destination for Saudi
Arabia preachers to deliver talks, and organize seminars and
trainings due to the good relations that had been established
during Mohd Asri's time. Perlis representatives on official
visits and in delegations to the kingdom were always given
special attention and treatment by the Saudi government (M.
A. Zainul Abidin, personal communication, July 29, 2014).
It is believed that the short Shahidan-Mohd Asri golden
period was a reawakening of the "Sunnah" for many people
in Perlis. However, one may refer to Akram Dahaman in his
MA dissertation (Universiti Malaya) who concludes that the
Sunnah Perlis idea only had a significant role in the formula-
tion of the fatwa with no real effect on enforcement and
promulgation (Mohd Akram, 2005). This is due to the strong
mainstream Shafii madhhab influence among Muslims in
Malaysia which includes Muslims in Perlis. However, the
dissertation was completed before Dr. Asri Zainul Abidin
became the mufti of the state during which time he brought a
new chapter to the practice of Sunnah Perlis and to the life of
the people of Perlis. Although no thorough academic exer-
cise has ever been done on the acceptance of the people of
Perlis of Sunnah Perlis after the time of Mohd Asri as Mufti,
however, the wide and all encompassing programs and
enforcement done while he was Mufti have made significant
changes to the way the "Sunnah Perlis" is practised beyond
the fatwa formulation.
However, Othman and Rahmat (1991), who had con-
ducted a research on the topic of acceptance of the people of
Perlis of "Sunnah Perlis" in the year 1991, found that 76.5%
of respondents agreed with Sunnah Perlis, while 23.5% dis-
agreed (p. 402). In contrast, Man (2006) points out, in his
report, that according to his observation on 30 mosques all
over Perlis, one third of the mosques still adhere to Shafii
madhhab and do not practice the "Sunnah Perlis" way in
conducting their congregational rituals and worships (p.
154). Still, there is yet no thorough academic exercise done
on the impact of Shahidan-Mohd Asri's "Sunnah" legacy on
the practice of Islam among the Muslim community in Perlis.
Part of Mohd Asri's legacy and approach were later con-
tinued by his successor, Dr. Juanda Jaya. Juanda claims that
even from his first day in office, his approach will be differ-
ent from that of Mohd Asri (J. Jaya, personal communica-
tion, July 28, 2014). Things became worse after Shahidan
Kassim failed to secure his position as Menteri Besar of
Perlis after the 12th General Election. Despite his victory in
his constituency, and his personal victory to secure Perlis
from falling to the opposition due to the political tsunami in
the 2008 general election, the King of Perlis did not give his
consent for Shahidan to become the Menteri Besar. The
King, instead, appointed his successor, Dr. Md Isa Sabu, an
UMNO stalwart, as the new Menteri Besar of Perlis (M. S.
Md Ismail, personal communication, August 25, 2014).
Unlike Shahidan, Md Isa failed to continue the aggressive
struggle to uphold the "Sunnah" agenda in the state. He was
never reported to have voiced any concern or made any sub-
stantial contribution toward the propagation of the "Sunnah"
in Perlis. However, according to Juanda, he was not left
alone to continue the "Sunnah" agenda. With all his limita-
tion as Mufti, Md Isa did indirectly assisted him in his admin-
istration and never went against any decision made by the
mufti on any issues related to "Sunnah" matters (J. Jaya, per-
sonal communication, July 28, 2014). However, the absence
of any significant and aggressive effort from the Menteri
Besar after Shahidan has led "Sunnah" Perlis once again into
another phase of stagnation after the golden period it had
earlier experienced.
Despite the stagnation, Juanda managed to multiply the
publication of materials and books related to the Sunnah
Perlis teachings unlike in the Mohd Asri's era. There are
more than 50 titles of books, monographs, journals, reports,
and booklets published by the office of the Mufti under
Juanda's time. They were distributed without any commer-
cial purpose as part of the propagation of Islam and Perlis
Sunnah. The extensive publication during Juanda's term is a
mark of his legacy in strengthening Perlis' domination in the
history of Perlis (A. K. Ishak, personal communication,
August 28, 2015). In comparison to Mohd Asri's known for
his Sunnah rhetoric and controversial statements, Juanda, as
mufti was lesser known for these. He believed, instead, that
the dissemination of knowledge through publications would
create a long-lasting impact to the Sunnah cause (J. Jaya,
personal communication, July 28, 2014).
Nevertheless, in 2015, Mohd Asri was reappointed as
Mufti of Perlis after Juanda preferred not to continue to be in
office. The reappointment of Mohd Asri gave a new momen-
tum to the Sunnah Perlis movement after the relative stagna-
tion period. Unlike his earlier appointment which was
supported by the Menteri Besar, his second appointment was
at the direct preference of the King of Perlis himself. Mohd
Asri's efforts in strengthening Sunnah Perlis during his sec-
ond appointment was fully supported and blessed by both the
King and his Crown prince (Raja Muda). Various events,
activities, regulations, and platforms were conducted to
enhance the teachings of Islam which exceeded the tradi-
tional teachings of Sunnah Perlis which focused on rituals
(A. K. Ishak, personal communication, August 28, 2015).
Mohd Asri too proposed that a group of 15 PhD holders
were mainly academics to be part of his Fatwa Committee,
and they were later appointed by the King to the position (A.
K. Ishak, personal communication, August 28, 2015).
Numerous contemporary and nonconventional fatwa (decree)
10 SAGE Open
related to the modern contemporary and multicultural and
multireligious social cohesion were discussed and decreed
by the group, such as the decision that the custody of chil-
dren born into a non-Muslim family with any of their parents
having converted to Islam should be granted to the parent
deemed more capable of raising the child, regardless of their
religion, for the welfare of the children, rather than to auto-
matically convert them to Islam as practised in most other
states,7 the fatwa on the prohibition of any doings that harm
the environment beside the fatwa prohibiting the practice of
the female child genital mutilation (FGM), the permissibility
of having milk bank at government hospitals for the usage of
premature babies.8
Mohd Asri too was known for his contemporary, multira-
cial friendly but controversial opinions that usually went
against the popular conservative views of the religious estab-
lishment.9 He also actively addressed the khalwat issue,10
child custodianship,11 and the ineffectiveness of the Zakat
distribution,12 and his opinions have been seen by many as
going against the thoughts and flow of mainstream official
religious authorities. As an example, he went against state-
ments made by some religious figures labeling certain non-
Muslim parties, especially the opposition Democratic Action
Party (DAP) as kafir harbi. He appears to be a strong critic of
the efforts to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction)
Act 1965 to allow certain Hudud law punishment to be imple-
mented in certain states in Malaysia despite the national cam-
paign led by PAS and other Islamic organizations.13
Conclusion
Unlike the perception about the term Salafism that was gen-
erally associated with conservatism, rigidity, and extremism,
Sunnah Perlis, as a legacy of the early 20th-century reformed
Salafism, has a different face. Unlike the conventional repre-
sentation of the current Gulf-style Salafism, "Sunnah Perlis"
emphasizes the freedom from madhhab rigidity calling upon
Muslims to return directly to the two major sources of Islam
in dealing with religious issues, namely, al-Quran and
Sunnah (Prophet Muhammad's tradition). The historical
development of Sunnah Perlis, as a state-sponsored or
patronaged Salafism, has shown us the dynamism of the
movement itself. The presupposition and prevailing assump-
tion about the spread of "Sunnah" teaching in Perlis is about
the advancement of the state religious authority with the sup-
port from its monarchy.
It is undeniable that initially the rulers had played a perti-
nent role in keeping the "Sunnah" teaching strongly instilled
with the practice of the Perlis Muslim community. However,
throughout this research, historical evidence proves that both
propaganda and education play a relatively significant role in
maintaining the adherence of the people to the "Sunnah."
Moreover, the preaching of the "Sunnah" was not substan-
tively sufficient in defending the "Sunnah" practice among
Perlis Muslims. Historical events record that other factors,
such as legal, political, and administrative measures, have
been taken by "Sunnah" guardians throughout the 20th cen-
tury to maintain the feasibility of the "Sunnah" teaching.
Furthermore, it was during the "Tiga Mat" and Shahidan
Kasim-Mohd Asri periods that the religious authority of
Perlis made countless efforts to secure the "Sunnah" teach-
ings. These efforts are most significant in the establishment
of the enactment that allows the "Sunnah" to be imple-
mented, referred, and adhered to by the religious authority
and the monarchy. This form of enactment does not just limit
itself to the two institutions; it was also made use of in deter-
mining fatwas in Perlis. The domination of "Sunnah" teach-
ings was then completed when the religious authority and
scholars such as Mohd Asri went around the mosques in
Perlis to enforce the enactment and regulations in the state.
This is done to ensure this precious historical movement is
passed down to future generations.
The historical events indicate that political influence will
play a prudent role in ensuring the survival of the "Sunnah" in
Perlis. During preindependent Malaya, the monarchs played a
significantly pertinent role in installing and preserving the
"Sunnah" teachings. During postindependent Malaysia, how-
ever, it was the politicians and mainly UMNO politicians who
fought for the "Sunnah" teaching to remain as the prevailing
and dominant Islamic discourse in Perlis. Similarly, in the 21st
century, the political will is not the sole factor in influencing
the enforcement and spread of the "Sunnah" in Perlis; global-
ization and media coverage have helped it to gain a more sub-
stantive existence in Perlis. Unlike the 20th century, "Sunnah"
survival in Perlis remains a local struggle for the reformists in
Perlis. The 21st century has witnessed the "Sunnah" teaching
as a nationwide reform movement, starting from the Mohd
Asri-Shahidan period, and it can be said to be mainly due to
media coverage and globalization.

2. Ustaz A. R. Abdul Rahman (personal communication, August
17, 2012), former official Preacher (Mubaligh) of Majlis
Agama Islam Perlis and Sunnah activist of Perlis.
 3. This earlier version of Salafiyyah, unlike the current conser-
vative Gulf or Saudi-style Salafiyyah, was known for its pro-
gressive and modern ideas. Lauzière (2010 & 2015) accurately
categorises this version of Salafism as the `reformed Salafism'
although this version of Salafism may share similar elements
with the current Gulf or Saudi-style Salafism in its episte-
mological references, but the former is closer to the ideals of
modernity, while the latter is more conservative.
 4. Among his books published, some still being kept at the Perlis
state library and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia library are
Ibadat Rasulullah (Prophet's Worships); Sejarah Nabi-Nabi
(Stories of the Prophets); Pergerakan Kaum Wanita Islam
(Muslim Women Movement); Jawaher al-Bukhari (The Jewel
of al-Bukhari); Kemerdekaan Berfikir Dalam Islam, Membasmi
Taqlid(FreedomofReasoninginIslam,AbolishingBlindfollow-
ing); Punca Penerangan Akal (Road to Mind Enlightenment);
Puasa Rasulullah (Prophet's Fasting); Panduan Puasa (Guide
for Fasting); Tafsir Juz `Amma (Exegesis of the 30th Supra of
al-Quran); Soal Jawab Agama (Q & A on Religious Issues); and
Khutbah Jumaat (Friday Sermons).
 5. Reports from newspapers on the first Ijtimak Sunnah could be
found at Berita Harian, January 18, 1986, and February 12,
1986; Utusan Malaysia, February 11, 1986; Watan, February
18 to 21, 1986; as for the second Ijtimak Sunnah, see Utusan
Malaysia, February 19, 1988.
6. For example, Islamic University of Madinah, Umm al-Qura
University in Makkah, King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah
and al-Imam University, Riyadh.
7. A controversial child conversion bill was drafted to address
concerns over the fate of children when a parent converts to
Islam. The bill would have permitted unilateral conversions of
minor children to Islam with the permission of only one parent.
When conversion is allowed with the consent of only one par-
ent, the right of the converting parent to change the child's reli-
gion is recognized, but the right of the non-Muslim spouse is
ignored. Although this is allowed under Sharia law in the states
of Perak, Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, Sarawak, and Malacca, the
controversial bill would have allowed the practice throughout
the country. However, the government withdrew the bill on
July 5 amid vigorous criticism originating from the opposi-
tion, civil society, and some members of the ruling party. But it
does not soothe non-Muslim anger as the clause still exists in
the Islamic enactments in the aforementioned states (see http://
www.state.gov/documents/organization/222357.pdf); Perlis
Fatwa committee has decided that the custody of children born
in a non-Muslim family who any of their parents converted to
Islam should be granted to the parent deemed more capable of
raising the child regardless of their religion for the welfare of
the children. He insisted that such a view represents the true
teachings of Islam that emphasize justice (see Shazwani, 2015).
 8. Many of these fatwas could be found at the Mufti of Perlis per-
sonal website: http://drmaza.com/home/; and from the Office
of the Mufti's official website: http://mufti.perlis.gov.my/
 9. His views and opinions could be found at the Mufti of Perlis
personal website: http://drmaza.com/home/
10. See http://drmaza.com/home/?p=2827
11. He insisted that such a view represents the true teachings of
Islam that emphasize justice (see Shazwani, 2015).
12. See: http://drmaza.blogspot.my/2007/02/kuala-lumpur-distri-
bution-of-zakat.html. Furthermore, his criticism of the Zakat
institution rhymes very well with the lay Muslim who demand
transparency, accountability, and competency of the collec-
tion, utilization, and distribution of Zakat funds (see http://
www.astroawani.com/gaya-hidup/10-hujah-jawab-viral-nega-
tif-mengenai-zakat-109260).
13. The private member's bill named Shariah Court Act pro-
poses to amend the Syariah Courts (Criminal Jurisdiction) Act
1965 was tabled by the president of PAS among others aim
to enhance the punishment for Shariah misconduct, which
eventually allowed certain Hudud (Islamic criminal punish-
ment law) to be enacted and implemented in certain states in
Malaysia (see Pejabat Mufti Wilayah Persekutuan, 2016).
