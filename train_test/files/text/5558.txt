Introduction
For centuries, the United States has opened its doors to
immigrants from many parts of the world, and the past two
decades have marked one of the most significant periods in
immigration history (Davies, 2008). Despite its long immi-
grant history, the United States has no formal immigrant inte-
gration policy (M. M. Suárez-Orozco, Suárez-Orozco, &
Sattin-Bajaj, 2010). Immigrant arrivals a century ago were
overwhelmingly European whereas today's immigrants
come primarily from Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America
(Lobo, Salvo, & Virgin, 1996; Migration Policy Institute,
2002). Groups which had little immigrant representation in
the late 1980s, such as Mexicans and West Africans, have
become a much more significant presence in recent years
(Corra & Kimuna, 2009; Foner, 2009).
In the 1980s and 1990s, during the great wave of immi-
gration, male immigrants outnumbered female immigrants;
however, the majority of immigrants to the United States
today are women (Houstoun, Kramer, & Barrett, 1984;
Zlotnik, 2003). Although some of these women immigrated
on their own, most others enter the United States relying on
their marriage to a man who is a citizen of the United States
or a legal permanent resident (Martin, 2004; Narayan, 1995).
Immigrant women who arrive from non-Western cultures are
likely to face numerous challenges related to migration,
unrealistic expectations, lack of language skills, and being
forced to cope with cultural differences (Carr, Koyama, &
Thiagarajan, 2003; Williams, 2011). This article will exam-
ine these challenges and how a social support group helped
to assist these women and alleviate some of the issues,
stresses, and concerns facing them. In the end, "immigration
. . . is about human beings" (M. M. Suárez-Orozco et al.,
2010, p. 535) and how they adapt to their new communities.
The Women of Care Program was able to sustain its fund-
ing through grants from several organizations, such as the
Open Meadows Foundation, in-kind donations from local

Abstract
The purpose of this case study was to describe a single multicultural women's support program known as the Women of
Care Project. The program was conducted in a community in the Midwest region of the United States and began in 2005 with
a grant from the Open Meadows Foundation. Participants were volunteers who were recruited for the program through pre-
existing access points to the Bosnian, African, and Hispanic communities, such as ethnic churches, markets, and key contacts
within these communities. The support group format for the Women of Care Program was an open group format in which
participants were encouraged to invite their friends to join. The initial support group consisted of women from various
cultural origins, including Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, Russia, Sierra Leone, Brazil, China, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Bosnia, Mexico,
and the United States. This case study was based on focus group discussions, as well as observations and completion of
evaluation forms. To analyze data, the focus group discussion notes and summaries were rearranged into recurring themes.
The evaluation provided further feedback from the discussions to cement these themes. Findings suggested immigrants,
especially women, benefit from support groups. Group involvement could empower women and increase their general sense
of well-being in overcoming barriers they may face in transitioning into a new environment. It is recommended that host
communities have integration programs which benefit both the host community and the immigrant: a win­win situation.

churches as well as monetary donations from various organi-
zations and churches throughout the state. Evaluation tools
for this program included focus groups, observations, feed-
back elicited from the participants, and completion of evalu-
ation forms.
Expectations
Upon arrival in the United States, immigrant women face a
reality that is different from their expectations, which tends
to cause emotional distress (Williams, 2011). For many
immigrant women, especially those from non-Western cul-
tures, their expectations are based on Hollywood movies and
books in which women are portrayed as being successful,
glamorous, and independent. These assumptions can become
a stumbling block, hindering many immigrant women from
adapting to their new lifestyle or coping with the reality of
women's roles in their new culture. "The mingling of reality
and aspiration can become problematic" (Sabates-Wheeler,
Taylor, & Natali, 2009, p. 753), as it leads women to base
their search for a better life on imaginary aspirations. For
married immigrant women with husbands who still believe
that a woman's place is in the kitchen, the differences
between both cultures create a stumbling block. As women
become "less fatalistic, less submissive, and more authoritar-
ian in the home" (Zarrugh, 1974, cited in Salgado de Snyder,
1987, p. 476), they challenge the role of men which often
strikes at the core of their self-esteem (Darvishpour, 2002;
Shirpak, Tyndale, & Chinichian, 2011) making it impossible
for a peaceful marriage.
Language
The ability to navigate within a new environment requires a
working knowledge of the primary language spoken by the
host country. Female immigrants are more likely than men to
face the harsh reality of trying to survive without a working
knowledge of the host language (Batalova & Fix, 2010;
Hyman & Dussault, 1996). In their role as mothers, women
are required to function and interact publicly in places such
as "stores, schools, and the workplace" (Hondagneu-Sotelo
cited in King & De Fina, 2010, p. 654). In these environ-
ments, a woman's lack of language proficiency may limit her
ability to communicate effectively, which may restrict her
access to public life and community services. A lack of abil-
ity to communicate with school staff, for example, may make
it difficult for these women to adequately participate in their
children's educational experiences (Batalova & Fix, 2010).
In addition, language deficiencies prevent many immi-
grant women from "interacting with American-born neigh-
bors, engaging in civic life, and becoming integrated into
their new community" (Chenoweth, 2006, p. 185), leading to
a lack of knowledge of the social safety net--health care,
housing, and welfare services. Deficiency in language skills
also inhibits mobility and serves as a barrier to identifying
occupations that are "safe to pursue" and often prevent
female immigrants from "securing a well-paying job in
which English is an essential tool for communication" (Ma
& Yeh, 2010, p. 232). With limited language skills affecting
employment opportunities for immigrant women, research-
ers believe that "immigration and unemployment create
three sources of stressors: uncertainty about the future
(Atkinson et al., 1986; Shalit, 1977), financial and emotional
distress due to the lack of a job (Jacobson, 1986), and exclu-
sion from main-stream society (Muller, 1993)" as cited in
Lev-Wiesel and Kaufman (2004, p. 60).
Culture
According to Norman (2015), raising children in a new envi-
ronment presents unique challenges. On a daily basis, women
are confronted with monitoring their children's schoolwork,
maintaining family traditions, and balancing family dynam-
ics. For instance, when parents are confronted with the man-
ner children speak to adults, the opposing cultural values can
create an outcome which can be disheartening to the parents.
While immigrant parents' expectations, norms, rules, and
beliefs about child rearing, family roles, and obligations tend
to remain stable, children's attitudes can change greatly over
time (Xiong, Eliason, Detzner, & Cleveland, 2005).
In comparison with many cultures, the United States tends
to be a more permissive society, allowing children a degree
of autonomy to which many immigrants may not be accus-
tomed (Parsai, Nieri, & Villar, 2010). For most immigrant
mothers, training these children becomes a Herculean task as
they strive to keep their children within the bounds of what
they deem to be correct principles. Conflicts arise because
children who live in this new society have usually gained a
new perspective on life (Daglar, Melhuish, & Barnes, 2011;
Parsai et al., 2010). More specifically, the children's outlook
on life is reflected in what they wear, how they speak, and
even what they eat (Yao, 1985). For example, they may wear
clothing considered to be inappropriate by the standards
maintained by the parent and may begin to speak in ways
which are difficult to understand or are considered rude
within their previous culture (Portes & Rumbaut, 2001; Yao,
1985).
Having interacted with and been exposed to their peers,
the children may develop a taste for American dishes and
request that their parents provide such meals (Yao, 1985). As
many immigrant families have limited finances (Batalova &
Fix, 2010), providing two different meals designed to satisfy
the newly acquired tastes of their children may strain the
family budget and fray the parents'nerves. In essence, immi-
grant home life can become a stressful place in which diverg-
ing groups of people try to accommodate one another.
The resulting stress from emotional, social, cultural, edu-
cational, and economic adjustments may prompt immigrant
women to gravitate toward social support groups (Kazemipur,
2006). Social support systems can validate the experiences
Msengi et al. 3
of immigrant women and provide powerful coping resources
(Carr et al., 2003). As opposed to many individual friend-
ships, a support group can serve to help its members generate
an increased number of solutions and ideas which provide
women with a variety of choices for dealing with their prob-
lems. According to Cho and Haslam (2010), social support is
particularly important to serve as a buffer against distress.
Relationships formed in support groups serve a critical func-
tion in maintaining and enhancing self-esteem, while provid-
ing acceptance, approval, and a sense of belonging (C.
Suárez-Orozco & Carhill, 2008). These relationships can
serve as replacements for families far away as well as a way
of maintaining cultures left behind (Bilge, 2012).
Method
The purpose of this case study was to describe a single mul-
ticultural women's support program known as the Women of
Care Project. The following research questions guided the
study:
Research Question 1: What steps were taken to develop
this multicultural women's support program?
Research Question 2: What were the activities of this
multicultural women's support program?
Research Question 3: What benefits did the women
derive from participating in the multicultural program?
Setting
The program was located in a community in the Midwest
region of the United States. The community where the pro-
gram was housed had been experiencing some of the most
significant demographic changes in the United States during
the past decade (Grey, 2006). According to Grey (2006), this
particular state had one of the largest percentages of aging
residents in the country with 370,000 people retiring over the
next decade as well as a decreasing birthrate. Also, half of
this state's college and university graduates leave the state
resulting in a large out-migration of the young workforce. To
bridge this gap, and to ensure the future economic and social
viability of the state, meatpacking and other industries in the
participating community and throughout the state actively
recruit refugees and immigrants from Latin America, Eastern
Europe, Asia, and Africa (Grey, 2006). Recent trends in
immigration in this Midwestern state also show an increase
in secondary migration of Burmese refugees (Molseed,
2011). These refugees have become attracted to the area
because of the abundance of readily available jobs, particu-
larly in the meatpacking industry.
Some industrial cities have worked with the U.S. State
Department to help bring refugees to their cities from refu-
gee camps across the nation (Molseed, 2011). These new
immigrant and refugee populations face many serious prob-
lems and obstacles that impede their successful integration
into their new environments. As a result, the Women of Care
Program and other similar programs were developed.
Data Collection and Analysis
The current study was a case study of a women immigrants
and refugees support group. Creswell (2007) mentioned dif-
ferent methods of data collection for case studies. Based on
Creswell's recommendations, this case study used focus
group discussions, observations, and completion of evalua-
tion forms collected after each monthly activity for a period
of 1 year (see Appendix B).
Speakers were invited to facilitate each event. Each event
was led by the program founder (African descent), Spanish
translator (Mexican descent), and Bosnian translator
(Bosnian descent). In addition, there were two women from
a local university who were interns working in the program
(Caucasian and Indian descent). The Spanish and Bosnian
translators helped with the issue of language during the focus
discussions.At the end of each event, an evaluation form was
given to evaluate the effectiveness of the program (see
Appendix A).
To analyze the data, the focus group discussion notes and
summaries were rearranged into the recurring themes
(Creswell, 2007). The evaluations provided further feedback
from the discussions to cement these themes.
Participants
"The Women of Care Project" was a monthly, year-long pro-
gram designed to benefit immigrant and refugee women new
to a community located in the Midwest region of the United
States while offering longtime residents the unprecedented
opportunity to meet and better understand these newcomers
and their cultures. The project was built upon a support/edu-
cational group concept, providing a support network while
helping immigrant women integrate and adapt to their new
surroundings. The network also provided avenues for devel-
oping language skills and expanding educational and
employment opportunities, empowering these women to
become productive members of their communities.
Participants were recruited for the program through pre-
existing access points to the Bosnian, African, and Hispanic
communities, such as ethnic churches, markets, and key con-
tacts within these communities. All participants in the study
agreed to participate and consent forms were signed by each
individual to denote their informed consent. An average of
15 women attended the meetings; however, some activities
attracted more than 15 women from the community. For
example, the International Tea Party, a scheduled event that
showcased different types of tea, attracted more than 100
women from the community. This gala event provided
women an opportunity to meet, greet, and converse with
other women while also sampling various brews of tea from
around the world.
4 SAGE Open
The program started with women from different cultural
backgrounds, including Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, Russia,
Sierra Leone, Brazil, China, Taiwan, India, Nepal, Bosnia,
Mexico, and the United States. To ameliorate the high levels
of stress and depression among these women, the program
used methods to reduce stress and depression which were
different from traditional Western approaches. Because these
women often reported feeling detached from the community
due to cultural differences, unfulfilled expectations, lack of
trust in the traditional health care system, and language bar-
riers, several activities were provided to address their chal-
lenges in a holistic way.
Program Description
The first procedure conducted in the study involved partici-
pants being matched with a local volunteer who acted as a con-
versational partner/friend. The purpose of this individual
interaction was twofold: It allowed the newcomer to practice and
develop her English skills in a non-threatening environment, and
it provided the women with someone who could assist them with
their individual needs. Also, in the beginning months of the pro-
gram, the agency held a "Welcome to Our Community" series of
activities, including a tour of the area. This series allowed the
women to become more familiar with the community in a secure
group setting while allowing them to become aware of area
resources and other agencies in the community.
In the second procedure, staff and translators conducted
home visits to the women's homes. Home visits tend to be
especially important among the immigrant and refugee pop-
ulation who oftentimes have no means of transportation and
typically lack familiarity with telephone and written com-
munication styles in Western countries. Most of the women
in the current study came from communities where face-to-
face communication was considered to be a valued means for
addressing serious matters.
Third, the women met collectively as a group once each
month. This group interaction enabled the women to create
new social connections with other women who were experi-
encing similar circumstances and experiences, which also
served to help the women combat their feelings of isolation.
Most of these women came from cultures where most activi-
ties were done in a group with extended families, friends,
village elders, religious leaders, and/or the general commu-
nity. Women were provided with opportunities to share their
stories, encourage each other, meet new friends, make con-
nections, improve/learn new skills, and gain a sense of
belonging to the community. Through these collective group
meetings, the women were afforded an opportunity to learn
and share with each other culturally sensitive and relevant
ways to manage their feelings of stress and depression.
Program Activities
The main activities of the group included cooking, dancing,
conducting presentations, and offering social support. In the
first year of the program, meetings were held biweekly with
one meeting each month being led by one of the women
from the group who showcased a recipe from her home
country. She also led the group in a demonstration of how to
prepare and cook the dish. The social group activities
were open to general members of the community. These
social group activities enabled the women to share their cul-
ture, build their confidence, and enhance their feelings of
self-worth.
The other meeting in the month focused on traditional
health practices, which included, but were not limited to,
natural medicines, food preparation practices, child-rearing
strategies, and taboos. An end result of the first year of the
program was that the women collectively put together a
cookbook. This cookbook was essentially a collection of
recipes from women in the program and others from the
community.
In 2007, the Women of Care Program hosted an
International Tea Party sponsored by the local branch of
the American Association of University Women. One hun-
dred people attended this event--immigrant/refugee
women and community members. Women from various
cultures wore their native clothing and shared their tea
time customs with the community members. Also, a mem-
ber of the community shared her collection of teapots,
described the history of tea, and exposed the group to vari-
ous types of tea.
Findings/Results
The women reported several benefits through participating
in this support group program. A number of the participants
reported that the program helped them develop better mental
and emotional wellness, as well as a general sense of well-
being for themselves, their children, and extended family
members. The support groups also helped these women
overcome some of the barriers they faced in the areas of lan-
guage, culture, poverty, and discrimination, issues which
made it very difficult for them to function competently in a
new community. In addition, the support groups created a
place where the participants connected with people with sim-
ilar experiences. This sharing format helped to alleviate
some of the pain and difficulties associated with the accul-
turation process.
The participants made friends quickly and created a sup-
port system they could rely on for strength. Sharing tradi-
tions and different food ideas were empowering to the
women because they felt their contribution to this new social
environment was valuable to others. It also afforded local
residents a unique opportunity to learn about women from
other cultures. Newcomers and members of the host com-
munity even shared their knowledge of job opportunities and
agreed to serve as references for each other. To date, many of
the participants still share their joys with each other, includ-
ing sharing news about birthdays, graduations, newborns,
weddings, anniversaries, and vacations.

Discussion
The purpose of this case study was to describe a single mul-
ticultural women's support group program known as the
Women of Care Project. Regarding the questions posed by
the study, (a) the women who participated in the study were
a diverse group of immigrant women who shared their cul-
tures with one another, members of the community, and the
staff from the program to define their uniqueness and find
support from one another and the project leaders, the direc-
tors of the program advertised the program in the community
to solicit participants and set up scheduled meetings as well
as guided activities for the participants; (b) the program pro-
vided numerous activities such as cooking sessions, tea
socials, stress management sessions, and many others (see
Appendix B); and (c) the program provided opportunities for
the women to develop a sense of belonging and experienced
enhanced self-worth and self-esteem through their participa-
tion in the program.
Assisting immigrant newcomers in making adjustments,
finding employment, and in coping with a new cultural con-
text has been suggested in previous research (Lev-Wiesel &
Kaufman, 2004). There is a need to foster the development of
social support groups that assist new immigrants in an
attempt to broaden the social ties of the immigrants with the
demands of their new environment. It is recommended that
policy makers and service providers develop programs for
this specific population. Development of support groups and
social networks will enable these immigrant women to
acquire skills needed to help them better interact with the
community as they try to cope with the adversity presented
to them in their new culture as well as serve to empower
them in the process. Programs are needed that empower
women and teach them techniques and strategies in adopting
an active rather that a passive role in the adaptation process.
Therefore, programs should be created to facilitate the pro-
cess of helping these women make the necessary adjustments
for adapting to the host community.
Future research should focus on helping immigrant
women adapt to change and how society can create a sup-
portive environment to facilitate their success. Group inter-
action is an integral part of the process and provides a vital
means of furthering identity development and social support
for immigrant women. Being able to share their experiences
with others is both significant and helpful. Interaction with
other women and sharing experiences can serve as a founda-
tion to their success and can provide a unique set of cross-
cultural learning experiences. More importantly, female
leaders from other ethnicities may serve as positive role
models for immigrant women in assisting their acculturation
experiences and provide a support system through social
engagement.
In addition, a follow-up study should be conducted to
investigate how these women are continuing to adapt, what
are their current challenges now, and how they are integrat-
ing into the society. Such a study should focus on these wom-
en's daily routines, experiences, and reflections of their lives
in the United States.
Conclusion
The women in this study benefited from the activities and
networking provided through participating in this program.
The skills, resources, and networking provided through their
participation in the program increased the likelihood of suc-
ceeding and better integrating into their new environment.
The sense of sharing and contributing to other women in the
group created a sense of belonging and empowerment as
indicated by their feedback.
As the number of immigrant women continues to grow
(Migration Policy Institute, 2002), it would be beneficial for
local communities to create programs to help women and
their families integrate into American culture. Based on the
experiences of the women in the Women of Care Program, it
is suggested that social support validated the experiences of
women and provided a powerful coping resource for those
who were dealing with stressful life changes (Carr et al.,
2003). It is recommended that integration programs for new
immigrants be implemented. Faith-based organizations and
educational institutions which have a large population of
international students as well as other well-meaning individ-
uals should collaborate to implement similar programs.
Individuals who conduct these programs should be culturally
aware of the diversity that exists among immigrants. Better
integration benefits the host community and the immigrant,
which is a win­win situation for everyone involved.
