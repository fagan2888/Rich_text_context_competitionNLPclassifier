Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is affecting an increasing proportion of
population worldwide. Environments that foster physical
inactivity and access to diet rich in energy are the most
important determinants of this epidemic (Unwin et al.,
2010.) In Finland, about 9percent of the population already
has type 2 diabetes. The amount of diagnosed patients with
type 2 diabetes has been doubled in intervals of 12years,
and there is no sign of change in this trend (Koski, 2011).
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized
by chronic hyperglycemia (Alberti and Zimmet, 1998).
Achieving and maintaining recommended levels of glyce-
mic control is the main target in the management of diabe-
tes. Good glycemic control is essential in order to reduce
micro- and macrovascular complications associated with
diabetes. Glycemic control is best achieved by pharmaco-
logic therapy combined with lifestyle changes including
weight loss, increased physical activity, and healthy diet
(American Diabetes Association, 2011, 2014).
Autonomy-supportive health-care climate is one factor
that is supposed to promote healthy lifestyle and good
glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes
(Williams et al., 1998). According to the self-determination
theory (SDT), people are most effective in long-term glyce-
mic control when they are autonomously motivated and
feel competent with respect to critical self-management
behaviors (Deci and Ryan, 1985). SDT assumes that people
are oriented toward physical and psychological health.
They also have psychological needs for autonomy, compe-
tence, and relatedness. Autonomous motivation and feeling
of competence for effective self-management of diabetes is
best achieved in environments that support these basic psy-
chological needs. Health-care personnel's autonomy- and

Abstract
This study showed, in line with self-determination theory, that glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes
(n=2866) was strongly associated with perceived self-care competence, which in turn was associated with autonomous
motivation and autonomy-supportive health-care climate. These associations remained after adjusting for the effect of
important life-context factors. Autonomous motivation partially mediated the effect of health-care climate on perceived
competence, which fully mediated the effect of autonomous motivation on glycemic control. The results of the study
emphasize health-care personnel's important role in supporting patients' autonomous motivation and perceived self-care
competence.

relatedness-supportive behaviors, such as acknowledging
patients' perspectives and giving relevant information,
respect, and understanding, are supposed to enhance
patients' sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness,
which in turn is assumed to be positively associated with
favorable health behavior change and ultimately better
physical and mental health (Ryan and Deci, 2000; Williams
et al., 2009.) Need satisfaction and sense of being the initia-
tor of the behavior and being competent to control impor-
tant outcomes such as maintaining glucose levels in a
healthy range are assumed to give long-term psychological
energy for adapting and maintaining healthy lifestyle (Ng
et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2004). The meta-analysis by
Ng et al. (2012) showed that the SDT-model has got sup-
port in several studies analyzing various variables as out-
come of care, for example, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL)-cholesterol, HbA1c and glucose levels (Williams
et al., 1998, 2004, 2005, 2009), depression and patient sat-
isfaction (Williams et al., 2005), and medical adherence
(Williams et al., 1998).
Health-care climate is an important but not the only
factor that possibly affects patients' perceived compe-
tence in diabetes self-management and ultimately glyce-
mic control. The effect of the larger life context, such as
the severity of the illness, other stressful experiences, per-
sonality factors, and social support, should also be evalu-
ated. Patients with diabetes are forced to cope with
self-management demands and threat of complications
and their possible effect on daily functioning and impor-
tant roles (Gonzales et al., 2011). Other stressful life expe-
riences may additionally increase the general stress level
and decrease emotional well-being. For example, the
prevalence of major depression and minor depressive
symptoms has been shown to be significantly higher in
patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general popula-
tion (Ali et al., 2006; Anderson et al., 2001; Nouwen
et al., 2010). Several studies have found an association
between depressive symptoms and poor self-management
of diabetes, unsatisfactory glycemic control, and compli-
cations of diabetes (Ali et al., 2006; De Groot et al., 2001;
Dirmaier et al., 2010; Egede and Ellis, 2010; Gonzales
et al., 2007).
Significant others in the person's social context may
also have an effect on perceived competence and glycemic
control to the extent that these persons are autonomy sup-
portive (Williams et al., 1998). In addition, personality ori-
entations, such as a strong sense of coherence, may
enhance perceived self-care competence directly or indi-
rectly by increasing the ability to cope with stress
(Antonovsky, 1987). Socioeconomic status may be associ-
ated with glycemic control through health behavior, since
many unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking, poor dietary
habits, and physical inactivity, are known to be more prev-
alent in lower socioeconomic groups (Laaksonen et al.,
2008).
This study extends previous research by examining
whether the perceived health-care climate is associated
with outcomes of care, in terms of perceived competence in
diabetes care and glycemic control, when the effect of a
wide variety of other important life-context factors is con-
trolled for.
We hypothesize that an autonomy-supporting health-
care climate and autonomous motivation are positively
associated with perceived self-care competence even after
the effect of other important life-context factors is con-
trolled for. Also, we hypothesize that an autonomy-support-
ing health-care climate, autonomous motivation, and
perceived self-care competence are positively associated
with good glycemic control even after the effect of other
important life-context factors is controlled for.
Methods
Data collection
The sample of the study was collected in 2011 from the
register of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII).
SII is a Finnish government agency (funded directly from
taxation) in charge of settling benefits under national social
security programs. SII handles retirement pay, child bene-
fits, unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, health
insurance, and student benefits. All permanent residents of
Finland are covered under the Finnish National Health
Insurance (NHI) scheme and are eligible for reimbursement
of medical expenses under the Health Insurance Act. SII
keeps the register of those persons who have entitlement to
a special reimbursement for medicines because of chronic
diseases such as diabetes. The sample for this study was
collected among persons who fulfilled the following inclu-
sion criteria:
1. Had entitlement to a special reimbursement for
medicines used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes
(International Classification of Disease­10 (ICD-
10) code, E11) in 2000­2010, and the right was
valid in September 2011 and onward;
2. Born in 1936­1991 (20­75years), alive, and had no
safety prohibition at the time of the data collection;
3. Finnish as native language; and
4. One of the five study municipalities as place of
residence.
A total of 7575 persons fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Based on power-analysis, a sample of 5167 persons was
collected: 2000 persons from the two large municipalities
and all persons from the three small municipalities. There
were 2962 (57%) men and 2205 women (43%) in the
sample, corresponding the rate of sex in the total popula-
tion of patients with type 2 diabetes in the study
municipalities.
Koponen et al. 3
The questionnaire was tested by a pilot study (n=50) in
May 2011, and after some revisions, the questionnaire was
mailed to respondents in September 2011. A reminder to
nonrespondents was sent out in October, and another
reminder with a new copy of the questionnaire was sent out
in November. The final response rate was 56
percent
(n=2866). The response rates in the two large municipali-
ties were 54 and 56percent, and in the three small munici-
palities 54, 56, and 59percent. Women responded slightly
more often (57%) than men (54%). The response rate was
highest (63%) in the oldest age group (65­75years), lower
(55%) in the age group of 55­64years, and lowest (36%) in
the age group of 20­54years.
Ethical issues
The research plan was accepted by the Ethical Committee
of the Hjelt Institute, University of Helsinki, and the per-
mission to conduct the study was received from the SII. The
sample was collected by the contact person who worked at
the SII, and the questionnaires were posted from there.
Respondents returned filled questionnaires, provided only
by an identification number, directly to the researchers by
mail. An identification number was needed in order to
check for nonresponse. Identity of respondents was not
revealed to the researchers at any stage of the sample or
data collection, nor was the content of the questionnaires
revealed to anybody else except the researchers.
Respondents
The mean age of respondents was 63years (standard devia-
tion (SD): 8
years, range: 27­75
years), and 56
percent of
them were men. Over half (56%) of the respondents were
retired because of old age, 60
percent were married, and
59percent had less than higher professional education. The
majority (83%) of the respondents had a municipal primary
care health center as their primary care place in diabetes
care, and 74percent used tablets only for diabetes therapy
(Table 1).
Measures
Measures used in the study are presented in Table 2.
Averaged sum scales for health-care climate, autonomous
motivation, perceived competence, energy, emotional well-
being, sense of coherence, life stress, and social support in
diabetes were calculated. The respondent was included in
the analysis if she or he had answered at least to 70percent
of the scale items.
Statistical procedures
Descriptive statistics were estimated, and the baseline asso-
ciations between independent variables, covariates, and
dependent variables were tested with Pearson chi-square-tests,
t-tests, or one-way analysis of variance depending on the
measurement scale of the variable of interest. In the final
analyses, multivariate linear and logistic regression analy-
ses were used. The correlations between study variables
were explored before the analyses by Pearson or Spearman
correlations. The variables for the regression models were
chosen on theoretical and statistical basis. Independent var-
iables that correlated strongly with each other, such as vari-
ables measuring mental well-being, were omitted from the
regression analyses. Only the variable that correlated most
strongly with the dependent variable was chosen for the
models.

The distributions of health-care climate, autonomous
motivation, perceived competence, energy, emotional well-
being, and sense of coherence scales were skewed to the
right, and the distribution of the life stress scale was skewed
to the left but without influence on the analysis. Statistical
requirements for normal distribution, linearity, and homo-
scedasticity of regression residuals were fulfilled. List-wise
deletion of missing data was used.
In the mediation analyses between health-care climate,
autonomous motivation, perceived competence, and gly-
cemic control, the instructions reported by Baron and
Kenny (1986) were followed. First, the mediator was
regressed on the independent variable. Second, the
dependent variable was regressed on the independent var-
iable. Third, the dependent variable was regressed on both
the independent variable and on the mediator. A mediation
exists if the predicted associations hold on each step of the
analysis and if the effect of the independent variable on
the dependent variable is less in the third step than in the
second step. The mediation is perfect if the independent
variable has no effect when the mediator is controlled
(Baron and Kenny, 1986). Statistical significance of the
mediation was calculated by the Sobel test (Preacher and
Leonardelli, 2003).
Statistical analyses were performed using complex
samples-procedure, which allows the use of weight coef-
ficients in order to correct bias caused by the different
sample collection methods in the small (all patients with
type 2 diabetes) and big municipalities (a sample). SPSS
version 20 was used.
Results
Health-care climate, reflecting the patient's assessment of
his or her doctor's autonomy-supportive behavior in the
health center, was quite good (mean: 3.6, SD: 1.2, range:
1­5). The same was true with patients'autonomous motiva-
tion (mean: 5.6, SD: 1.2, range: 1­7) and perceived self-
care competence (mean: 4.2, SD: 0.9, range: 1­5). A
majority (67%) of the patients reported good glycemic con-
trol (HbA1c<7% (53mmol/mol)) in the last measurement.
Almost all respondents (97%) reported having another
diagnosed chronic illness apart from diabetes. Hypertension
was the most common (72%) illness. A total of 42 percent
of the respondents had at least one diabetes-related addi-
tional complication of which retinopathy was the most
common (18%). A total of 22 percent of patients had a diag-
nosed depression.

The four variables measuring mental health or positive
personality orientation correlated strongly, that is, energy
correlated with emotional well-being (0.78***), sense of
coherence (0.58***), and depression (-0.38***). Of these
four variables, energy correlated most strongly with per-
ceived self-care competence (0.36***) and glycemic con-
trol (0.12***). Pearson correlations between emotional
well-being, sense of coherence, diagnosed depression, and
perceived self-care competence were 0.34***, 0.31***,
and -0.18***, respectively. Spearman correlations between
emotional well-being, sense of coherence, diagnosed
depression, and glycemic control were 0.09***, 0.08***,
and -0.05*, respectively. Therefore, energy was included
as an independent variable to the multivariate linear and
logistic regression analyses [***p<.001, *p<.05].
Table 3 shows correlations between the variables chosen
for the final analyses. Health-care climate correlated posi-
tively with autonomous motivation and perceived compe-
tence. These three SDT variables correlated positively with
perceived energy, perceived social support, and good self-
rated health, and negatively with stress. In addition, auton-
omous motivation and perceived competence correlated
positively with good glycemic control and negatively with
high body mass index (BMI), but these correlations were
quite modest.
Table 4 shows that perceived competence was strongly
associated with autonomous motivation and autonomy-
supportive health-care climate. In addition, perceived com-
petence was positively associated with good status of
health, energy, social support, and higher age and nega-
tively with stressful life experiences.
Table 5 shows that good glycemic control was strongly
associated with perceived competence but not with health-
care climate or autonomous motivation directly. The asso-
ciation between perceived competence and glycemic
control remained statistically significant after the effect of
disease related and other important life-context factors was
controlled for. Of these factors, using tablets only as diabe-
tes medication, higher age, higher professional education,
and female gender were positively, and long duration of
diabetes, high BMI, and social support in diabetes care
were negatively associated with glycemic control.
Table 6, describing the mediation analysis, shows that
health-care climate was positively associated with autono-
mous motivation and perceived competence and that the
effect of health-care climate on perceived competence was
reduced when the effect of autonomous motivation was
controlled for. This indicates that autonomous motivation
mediates the effect of health-care climate on perceived
competence. Also, autonomous motivation was positively
associated with perceived competence and glycemic con-
trol, and the effect of autonomous motivation on glycemic
control disappeared after the effect of perceived compe-
tence was controlled for, which indicates perfect mediation
(see Baron and Kenny, 1986).
Discussion
This study examined whether the health-care climate in pri-
mary care health centers is associated with outcomes of
care in terms of perceived competence in diabetes care and
glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes. The
results of the study supported the predictions derived from
the SDT (Williams et al., 2005) and emphasized the impor-
tant role of health care in supporting autonomous motiva-
tion and perceived competence in order to reach good
glycemic control.
As hypothesized, an autonomy-supporting health-care
climate and autonomous motivation were strongly associ-
ated with high perceived competence in diabetes care even
after the effect of other important life-context factors were
controlled for. Autonomous motivation partially mediated
the effect of health-care climate on perceived competence.
Our second hypothesis was partly supported. Glycemic
control was strongly associated with perceived competence
in diabetes care but not with health-care climate and auton-
omous motivation directly. The mediation analysis indi-
cated that the effect of autonomous motivation on glycemic
control was mediated by perceived competence.
Besides health-care-climate-related factors, disease
severity and other life-context factors played a role in the
outcomes of care. Perceived competence in diabetes care
was positively associated with good perceived health,
energy, social support, and higher age, and negatively asso-
ciated with stress. Glycemic control was positively associ-
ated with using tablets only as diabetes medication, higher
age, high professional education, and female gender, and
negatively associated with long duration of diabetes, high
BMI, and high social support in diabetes care. These results
indicate that it is important to promote general health and
well-being of patients with type 2 diabetes. As stated by
Gonzales et al. (2007), the assessment of the psychological
and social situation of patients should be included as an
ongoing part of the medical management of diabetes.
Social support in diabetes care was positively associated
with perceived competence but negatively associated with
glycemic control. This may be due to the fact that those
with poor glycemic control were more often insulin users
and thus seemed to have a more serious illness and more
need of support in diabetes care.
A total of 22percent of the patients in this study reported
diagnosed depression, while the prevalence of depression in
the whole population of Finland is about 5
percent (Pirkola
et al., 2005). This result is in line with the studies in other
countries that show higher prevalence of depression among
patients with type 2 diabetes compared with the general pop-
ulation (Ali et al., 2006; Anderson et al., 2001; Nouwen
et al., 2010). However, of the four variables that we used to
measure mental well-being, energy correlated most strongly
and diagnosed depression most weakly with perceived com-
petence in diabetes care and glycemic control. Also, the

results of Fisher et al. (2010) showed that diabetes distress,
which is a minor affective variable, was associated with gly-
cemic control but major depressive disorder was not. These
results indicate that minor affective variables, such as energy
and diabetes distress, may be better predictors of glycemic
control than diagnosed major depressive disorder.

The independent variables reported in this study were
chosen on theoretical and statistical basis. In addition to
these variables, we analyzed the effect of many health behav-
ior variables describing eating habits and physical exercise
on glycemic control. However, we found that BMI, which
reflects the result of health behavior, was a better predictor of
glycemic control than health behavior variables separately.
Therefore, we included BMI to the final analyses. Also, per-
ceived status of health was a better predictor of glycemic
control than reported complications, and therefore perceived
status of health was chosen for the final analyses.
The strength of this study was that in the analyses, we
were able to control the effect of many important diabetes
and life-context related factors. Even after this, the predic-
tions of the SDT held. The data, based on self-reports, were
highly reliable when compared with register data. We com-
pared basic information (diagnosis age, duration of diabe-
tes, medication, HbA1c-values, BMI) with register data
from the whole country (Valle et al., 2010) and information
on glycemic control also with the electronic medical
records from the municipal health centers in the study
municipalities (Koponen et al., 2013a, 2013b).
One limitation of the study was that, due to question-
naire technical reasons, we used 5-point Likert-scales
instead of 7-point scales in the health-care climate ques-
tionnaire (HCCQ) and perceived competence scale (PCS)
measures. However, we found no indication that this would
have reduced the validity of these measures. In fact, for
elderly people, as a majority of respondents were, it may be
easier to fill a 5-point scale. Another limitation of the study
was that a cross-sectional study is not methodologically
capable to state anything about directionality of the hypoth-
esized relations. However, 95
percent of the respondents
had been at least 1year, and 84percent over 2years in care
in their current and principal primary care health center.
Also, 75percent of the respondents had a family doctor or a
"regular" doctor. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that
care provided by the doctor and other health-care personnel
in the health center has influenced the patient's motivation
and perceived competence in diabetes care. In future, longi-
tudinal intervention studies are needed.
In summary, the results of this study were in line with
previous studies based on SDT (Ng et al., 2012) and gave
further support to this model. An autonomy-supportive
health-care climate may increase patients' sense of auton-
omy and competence that gives energy for long-term
change in self-management behavior and thus can lead to
better health. SDT can be used as a conceptual framework
to plan interventions for improved diabetes care.
Conclusion
Health-care personnel's main task is to support patients'
autonomy and perceived self-care competence in order to
