Diabetes is a well-established cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. The burden of
death attributable to diabetes in the United States is not well quantified, particularly with regard to age. The
authors analyzed data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) (1976­
1980) and the NHANES II Mortality Study, in which a nationally representative cohort of 9,250 adults aged 30­
75 years was followed for 12­16 years, to determine all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Overall, between
1976 and 1980, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was 4.3%. By 1992, the relative hazard of all-cause
mortality was 1.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.5, 2.3), and the population attributable risk (PAR) was 3.6%. The
relative hazard of CVD mortality was 2.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.8, 2.8), and the PAR was 5.2%. Including
participants with undiagnosed diabetes in the estimates increased the PAR for all-cause mortality to 5.1% and
that for CVD mortality to 6.8%. Women had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes than men and a greater
relative hazard of death than nondiabetic women, leading to a higher PAR for women (3.8% for all causes and
7.3% for CVD) versus men (3.3% for all causes and 3.8% for CVD). These data suggest that diabetes accounts
for at least 3.6% of all deaths and 5.2% of CVD deaths in US adults. Improvements in diabetes prevention and
treatment should produce noticeable effects on US life expectancy.

It is estimated that 5.9 percent of US adults over age 20
years have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (1, 2). By
the year 2025, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in US
adults may reach 8.9 percent (3). Diabetes is a well-estab-
lished risk factor for lower extremity amputation, retinop-
athy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease
(4). Thus, it is not surprising that diabetes contributed to
more than 190,000 deaths in the United States in 1997 (5)
and that it was listed as the underlying cause of death for
approximately 62,000 people (6), making it the seventh-
leading cause of death. However, such attributions are
subject to two major sources of bias. First, most studies esti-
mating the burden of diabetes are based on death certificate
coding, where underreporting of diabetes may lead to 50
percent of all deaths attributable to diabetes being missed
(7). Second, there is an assumption that all deaths among
people with diabetes are solely related to diabetes (i.e., that
the etiologic fraction is 100 percent), leading to an overesti-
mate of the number of deaths (8, 9).
A more sound approach is calculation of the population
attributable risk (PAR), which is independent of death certif-
icate coding and makes no a priori assumption about the
etiologic fraction. The PAR is a common tool for public
health officials and researchers for planning and allocating
health care resources and understanding the burden of
diabetes. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no
previously published studies with data on the PAR of
diabetes-related death in the United States (10, 11), nor have

any studies attempted to determine the number of excess
deaths after accounting for known risk factors for all-cause
or cardiovascular disease mortality.
Therefore, we sought to quantify the burden of death
attributable to diabetes in the United States, independent of
causes of death ascribed on death certificates, using a nation-
ally representative sample of adults. In the calculation of
PARs, we paid special attention to the effect of age, since
there is some controversy over the benefits of aggressive
diabetes care among older persons (12), and gender, since
there is evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease among women with diabetes (13).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Methods
Data sources. Data were obtained from the Second
National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES II)
Mortality Study, a prospective cohort study that passively
followed participants over 30 years of age who underwent a
detailed examination (n = 9,250). NHANES II was
conducted between 1976 and 1980 by the US National
Center for Health Statistics (14). The response rate for adults
aged 20­74 years who were selected and completed the
examination was 68 percent (15).
Participants. Participants were classified as having previ-
ously diagnosed diabetes if they answered "yes" to the ques-
tions "Do you have sugar diabetes?" and "Did a doctor tell
you that you had it?" (n = 542, 6.5 percent).
Baseline assessments. Data on participants' age at inter-
view, sex, race, years of education (less than high school,
high school or greater), and personal health characteristics
were obtained by interview (16, 17). The physical examina-
tion included measurements of height, weight, and blood
pressure (18). Body mass index was calculated as weight
(kg) divided by height (m) squared for each participant.
Laboratory measures included standard blood assays for
serum total cholesterol level (19).
To determine the effect of undiagnosed diabetes on esti-
mates of the number of deaths attributable to diabetes, we
conducted a subgroup analysis of participants selected for
oral glucose tolerance testing at baseline who had fasted for
at least 8 hours and had a fasting plasma glucose value (n =
3,262). By American Diabetes Association criteria (20), 225
participants (6.9 percent) with a fasting plasma glucose level
of 126 mg/dl were classified as having undiagnosed
diabetes.
Outcomes. Mortality status was ascertained for the years
1976­1992 by searching the National Death Index and the
Social Security Administration's Death Master File (21).
There was no censoring due to loss to follow-up in this
cohort; participants not found to be deceased by December
31, 1992, were assumed to be alive. Deaths were ascribed to
cardiovascular disease if any of the following conditions
were coded as the underlying cause of death according to the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision:
hypertensive heart disease (codes 402.0­402.9), ischemic
heart disease (codes 410.0­414.9), cardiac arrest (code
427.5), unspecified heart failure (code 428.9), unspecified
cardiovascular disease (code 429.2), cerebrovascular disease
(codes 430.0­438.9), and diseases of the arteries, arterioles,
and capillaries (codes 440.0­444.9).
Analysis
Weighting to the US population. All of the analyses were
weighted to the US population at the midpoint of NHANES
II (March 1, 1978) using SUDAAN statistical software,
version 6.4 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina) to account for the complex survey
design and to obtain nationally representative estimates (22).
Baseline comparisons. Demographic characteristics and
cardiovascular disease risk factors at baseline were
compared for participants with diabetes versus those without
diabetes using analysis of variance or Pearson's 2, after
stratification by age group. All tests of significance were
two-tailed. No corrections were made for multiple compari-
sons.
Proportional hazards analysis. To determine the inde-
pendent relative hazard of mortality related to diabetes, we
used proportional hazards models to adjust simultaneously
for age, sex, race, education, behavioral risk factors (phys-
ical activity and smoking), and biologic risk factors (body
mass index, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol
level). There were no significant first-order interactions
between diabetes status and any other covariate (all p's >
0.05). Graphs of the log-log plot of the relative hazards by
time showed that the assumption of proportional hazards was
met.
PAR analysis. The following formula was used to calcu-
late the PAR for the entire cohort and then separately for
each age group:
PAR = Pe
(RH ­ 1)/[Pe
(RH ­ 1) + 1],
where Pe
is the prevalence of diabetes and RH is the fully
adjusted relative hazard (23).
RESULTS
Characteristics and risk factors at baseline
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the cohort by
age group and diabetes status at baseline. Expected trends
were observed across age groups for participants with and
without diabetes.
PAR and age
Unlike the relative hazard of death related to diabetes,
which decreased with increasing age, the prevalence of
diabetes increased from the youngest group to the oldest
group (table 2). Thus, the PAR of all-cause mortality due to
diabetes increased from the youngest ages to the oldest (table
2). A similar trend was seen for cardiovascular disease
mortality (table 2).

PAR and gender
Overall, women had a slightly higher prevalence of diag-
nosed diabetes than men (4.7 percent vs. 3.8 percent, p =
0.05) (table 3). The relative hazard of mortality among
women with diagnosed diabetes compared with those
without diabetes was 1.83 (95 percent confidence interval
(CI): 1.32, 2.55) for all-cause mortality and 2.67 (95 percent

CI: 1.83, 3.88) for cardiovascular disease mortality. The
relative hazard of death for men with diagnosed diabetes
compared with those without diabetes was also increased:
1.90 (95 percent CI: 1.49, 2.42) for all-cause mortality and
2.04 (95 percent CI: 1.43, 2.91) for cardiovascular disease
mortality. The increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular
disease mortality for women with diagnosed diabetes trans-
lated to a higher PAR for women (3.8 percent for all causes
and 7.3 percent for cardiovascular disease) compared with
men (3.3 percent for all causes and 3.8 percent for cardiovas-
cular disease) (table 3).
Influence of undiagnosed diabetes
In the foregoing analyses, individuals with undiagnosed
diabetes were classified as "nondiabetic." To determine
whether reclassification of these individuals would influence
the PAR, we conducted a subsidiary analysis in a subgroup
of individuals who underwent oral glucose tolerance testing
(table 3). Incorporation of undiagnosed diabetes led to an
increase in prevalence (8.9 percent) but a decrease in the
relative hazard of death among persons with undiagnosed
and diagnosed diabetes compared with nondiabetics for all-
cause mortality (relative hazard = 1.60, 95 percent CI: 1.28,
2.00) and cardiovascular disease mortality (relative hazard =
1.82, 95 percent CI: 1.32, 2.51) (table 3). Since the increase
in prevalence was proportionally greater than the decrease in
the relative hazard, the net effect on the PAR was positive.
DISCUSSION
Beyond confirming an excess risk of mortality among
adults with diabetes, these results support two conclusions.
First, at least 3.6­5.1 percent of all deaths and 5.2­6.8
percent of cardiovascular disease deaths are attributable to
diabetes in the general US population aged 30­75 years.
PARs are even greater for women, whose relative hazard of
mortality related to diabetes is greater than that for men.
Second, the risk of mortality attributable to diabetes does not
diminish with age, even though the relative hazard declines
with age. This is due to the increase in the prevalence of
diabetes with age, which increases the number of deaths
related to diabetes and cancels out the effect of the
decreasing relative hazard.
Strengths of this study include its large, nationally repre-
sentative sample and 12­16 years of follow-up and the
ability to evaluate attributable risk estimates for undiagnosed
diabetes. Nonetheless, several limitations of this study
should be kept in mind. First, there was potential misclassi-
fication of vital status, because a person not found to be
deceased as of December 31, 1992, was assumed to be alive
at the end of follow-up (21, 24, 25). However, since vital
status was evaluated independently of diabetes status,
misclassification is likely to have been nondifferential and
would have produced a conservative bias (10). Second,
diabetes status was only assessed at one point in time, at
baseline. In populations similar to that of NHANES II, the
incidence rate of progression from impaired glucose toler-
ance to diabetes is approximately 40 per 1,000 person-years
(26). Participants with normal glucose tolerance or impaired
glucose tolerance who developed diabetes during follow-up
were considered to have no diabetes in this study. However,
it is to be expected that they would have higher mortality
than participants who never developed diabetes, biasing the
relative hazard and PAR estimates towards the null (27). For
these reasons, the results presented here may be underesti-
mates of the burden of death due to diabetes.
Third, NHANES II did not include individuals living in
institutions, including long-term care facilities and nursing
homes (14). The National Nursing Home Survey estimated
that approximately 60,000 people with diabetes aged 20­74
years were known to be in health care institutions and

nursing homes in 1977 (15). Such persons constitute 1.3
percent of the diagnosed diabetic population estimated from
NHANES II (15). It is to be expected that these individuals
would have greater mortality than persons who participated
in NHANES II. Finally, there was nonresponse in NHANES
II at each stage of the survey. In particular, for adults aged
20­74 years, only 68.0 percent of participants selected for
the examination completed it and thus were included in the
mortality study (14). On the other hand, respondents and
nonrespondents did not differ significantly in terms of demo-
graphic or health-related characteristics (28).
Methods of estimating deaths attributable to diabetes face
multiple biases. The commonly used approach involving
national mortality statistics and death certificates suggests
that diabetes contributes to 8.4 percent of deaths in the
United States (5, 6). However it is suspected that this quan-
tity is an underestimate, because death certificates do not
include 37­47 percent of people who have diabetes and die
(7­9) and they may underestimate diabetes deaths almost
threefold (29). Opposing this underreporting on death certif-
icates is the assumption that the etiologic fraction for deaths
among people with diabetes is 100 percent. Similarly, the
PAR calculation method used in this paper is likely to under-
estimate deaths attributable to diabetes, because of the
factors described above. While it is difficult to assign an
exact estimate to the proportion of deaths due to diabetes in
the United States, given the multiple biases, our conservative
estimate of 5.1 percent is relatively similar to previously
published estimates from mortality statistics (5, 16), and it
establishes an empirical lower limit for diabetes-related
mortality.
As the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase in the
United States, it will become more important to estimate the
impact of diabetes on mortality in order to effectively assess
progress in treating the disease (30). These results indicate
that improvements in the treatment and prevention of
diabetes may postpone these deaths and have an impact on
life expectancy in the United States, even at older ages. This
study suggests a need for research on barriers to and facilita-
tors of treatment for people with diabetes and the develop-
ment of approaches that promote cooperation by patients
with their treatment regimen.
