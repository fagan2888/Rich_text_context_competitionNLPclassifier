ONE of social epidemiology's crucial insights is that so-
cial conditions are a fundamental cause of disease (1).
Exploring the root conditions that generate health dispari-
ties in a population has provided a valuable corrective to a
simplistic biomedical emphasis on only the proximal causes
of disease. At the same time, the field is less clear on the
interplay between fundamental and proximal causes--
specifically, how the risks generated at each level (social
and physiological) are related to one other. The current
work draws from recent scientific work on the link between
body mass and inflammation, investigating competing models
of risk accumulation in the interaction of (fundamental)
social and (proximate) physiological risk factors among
older adults.
Low socioeconomic status (SES) and high body mass in-
dex (BMI) each pose risks for health and mortality. These
risk factors correspond to fundamental and proximal causes,
respectively. BMI and SES are negatively associated in
most developed societies (2), and each risk exerts an inde-
pendent effect on health net of the other (3). When consid-
ered jointly, however, the results are less consistent (4,5).
The purpose of this study is to advance an understanding of
the relationships between low SES, BMI, and C-reactive
protein (CRP).
CRP is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that has
been identified as a key biomeasure for cardiovascular dis-
ease risk for both men and women (6­8). Heightened CRP
levels are also associated with obesity and contribute to the
concern about why obesity is a danger for the development
of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (9,10).
CRP levels of less than 1, 1­3, and more than 3 mg/l are
considered clinical cut-offs for low, medium, and high level,
respectively, for cardiovascular risk (11).
A growing body of evidence also demonstrates that CRP
levels exist along a sharp socioeconomic gradient, with dis-
advantaged groups at a marked risk for elevated levels of
both inflammation and cardiovascular disease (3,12,13).
Studies examining the mechanisms underlying the SES­
CRP relationship typically find that one-half to two-thirds
of the association is attributable to lifestyle factors such as
obesity (12­14).
At this point, however, a major limitation is that research-
ers have focused on additive models of BMI and SES for
examining CRP levels. Multiplicative models, which enable

Background. Low socioeconomic status and high levels of body mass are two risk factors for elevated C-reactive
protein, a biomeasure signifying inflammation. Though past research identifies the additive effect of these particular risk
factors, this study examines their interactive effects to uncover whether body mass index exacerbates or levels the detri-
mental consequences of occupying a disadvantaged social position.
Methods. This study employs a representative survey of American adults, aged 57­84 years, using self-reported and
laboratory measures. Additive and multiplicative linear regression models are used to analyze logged C-reactive protein-
levels (mg/l) drawn from assayed blood samples.
Results. Significant negative interactions were observed between body mass index and two indicators of low socioeco-
nomic status on C-reactive protein, reflecting a cross-over effect.
Conclusions. The results demonstrated the importance of a multiplicative model for studying risk factor accumula-
tion and identify low socioeconomic status as an early and primary risk factor for elevated C-reactive protein.
Key Words: CRP--besity--SES--Risk factor accumulation--SES gradient.

one to observe whether SES moderates BMI's more proxi-
mal association with CRP, can illuminate the fundamental
cause thesis and inform targeted efforts to reduce cardiovas-
cular disease in the population.
One hypothesis is that people who are low in SES are
more vulnerable to the consequences of health-damaging
lifestyle choices or endogenous biological risk factors than
are advantaged people. This model is referred to as ampli-
fied risk accumulation. With compensatory mechanisms in
place (e.g., more sophisticated medical acumen), people
high in SES could offset some of the damage caused by
known cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., high body mass).
Those already confronted with the varied risks associated
with low social standing would see their risks amplify, reap-
ing additional disadvantage with each accruing proximal
risk (e.g., high BMI). Research reporting positive interac-
tions between SES and smoking status for morbidity risk
(15) and positive interactions between SES and physical in-
activity for mortality risk (16) support this model.
An alternative specification, likewise based on a multipli-
cative model, identifies that high SES groups would have
the most to lose from unhealthy lifestyles or endogenous
biological risks (e.g., high BMI). This model is premised
upon a hierarchy of risks and recognizes that high SES
groups benefit from a host of other advantages such as safer
work, lower stress, superior medical care, and better living
environments. Conversely, each risk will pose less potential
threat to health among low SES groups because they have
less to lose after accounting for the toll associated with
other risk factors (17). In this scenario, high SES levels the
impact of BMI on health.
Previous research on health risk factors shows limited
support for this thesis, consisting mostly of studies using
aggregated neighborhood-level data (18) or analyses with-
out tests of statistical significance (17). Surprisingly few
studies, however, investigate such interactive effects be-
tween fundamental social causes and proximal physiologi-
cal or behavioral causes.
Methods
Sample
This study uses the National Social Life, Health, and
Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative,
population-based sample during 2005­2006 of 3,005 adults
ages 57­85 in the United States. The NSHAP employs a
multistage area-probability design. In order to ensure
adequate representation of particular demographic groups,
respondents were oversampled by race, age, and gender. To
account for these sampling strategies, all regression analyses
are weighted and adjusted for the complex survey design in
Stata 10.0.
The NSHAP data are advantageous because in addition
to a full battery of questions regarding health and social be-
havior, the study included biological measures associated
with chronic disease risk such as CRP. The high response
rate (75.5%) is a further desirable feature of the study. Fur-
ther details about the NSHAP study can be found in
O'Muircheartaigh and colleagues (19)
CRP
An 83% random subset of the NSHAP sample was as-
signed to have capillary blood collection, which resulted in
1940 valid CRP records. Capillary blood was collected on
filter paper from a single finger stick and dried (20). After
being mailed from the collection site to the laboratory, sam-
ples were stored at -25°C and assayed for CRP using en-
zyme-linked immonosorbance (21). Values of CRP were
recorded in milligrams per liter and logged for regression
analysis. Because CRP levels of 10 mg/l and above are in-
dicative of acute infections or injurious stimuli, we removed
such cases, resulting in 1,833 cases for the analyses (22).
Due to the nonnormal, skewed distribution of CRP levels,
values were log transformed for use in regression analysis.
BMI
A number of body measurements were taken during the
biomeasure component of the NSHAP interview. Staff took
height and weight measurement of respondents. BMI was
calculated with the standard formula (kg/m2). In prelimi-
nary analyses, waist × height ratio was used as an alternate
measure of body composition but deleted it from the final
analyses for two reasons: the correlation between BMI and
waist × height ratio was extremely high (r = .88) in this
sample of older adults, and the relationships with CRP were
nearly identical for BMI and waist × height ratio.
SES Indicators
Commonly used indicators of SES include education, oc-
cupational prestige, and income levels. For this sample of
persons born between 1920 and 1949, educational status
was differentiated by whether or not the respondent gradu-
ated from high school (1 = high school degree, 0 = no high
school degree). With many persons currently retired and
without a typical income, a measure of net worth was used
to tap respondents' accumulated wealth. Prior research indi-
cates that net worth or wealth is a preferable measure to in-
come among older populations (23). Participants were asked
to estimate their net worth, considering all of their invest-
ments, properties, and other financial assets minus their
debt. Respondents who were unsure of their net worth were
given a series of follow-up questions to narrow the estimated
range (e.g., "would you say that all of your assets combined
amount to more or less than $50,000?"). For cases asked
these follow-up yes or no questions, respondents were as-
signed the midpoint value between relevant categories (e.g.,
$75,000 if greater than $50,000 and less than $100,000).
SES, BMI, AND CRP 669
Even with these less-specific retrieval questions, 135 cases
refused or were unable to answer the net worth question and
were dropped from final analyses. In sensitivity tests, analy-
ses of the full sample without dropping missing-net worth
cases yielded parallel substantive findings to those presented
herein. A dummy variable was created to differentiate re-
spondents in the lowest 20% of household net worth from
those in the top 80%. Further cut-offs were also used in sen-
sitivity analyses; results presented herein used the lowest
20% because of the precedent for using quintiles to examine
socioeconomic health disparities (24).
Health Lifestyles
For health lifestyle variables associated with SES, we use
self-reports of several health behaviors. Participants who
reported currently smoking cigarettes or using pipes, cigars,
chewing tobacco, or snuff were classified as current tobacco
users. Respondents who indicated that they formerly
smoked but no longer do so were considered past smokers.
Participants were asked about their engagement in physical
activities such as walking, dancing, or exercise and received
a score from 0 to 4 (0 = never engages in physical activity,
1 = once a month, 2 = one to three times a month, 3 = one
to two times a week, 4 = three or more times per week).
Finally, respondents were coded according to their average
level of alcohol consumption on days they drank: zero to
two, three to five, or more than six drinks per day.
Additional Covariates
In addition to the chief independent variables, additional
controls were included for a set of risk factors for inflamma-
tion used in previous studies and available in the NSHAP
data set (3,12,25). First are a series of demographic covari-
ates. Age is coded in years, and sex is dichotomized. Race
or ethnicity is divided into a series of dummy variables
(White, Black, non-Black Hispanic, other race), with non-
Hispanic White as the excluded reference group. Clinically
relevant health factors include dummy variables for whether
the respondent was ever told by a physician that he or she
had one of the following conditions: heart problem, arthri-
tis, emphysema or chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma,
or diabetes. Respondents were also asked to rate their
health, with categories ranging from poor (1) to excellent
(5). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, an 11-item index
concerning feelings the respondent experienced in the past

week (a = .79) (26). Hours slept per night were assessed
with a simple self-report of sleep on a typical night. During
the biomeasure collection portion of the NSHAP interview,
all respondents received two blood pressure readings. Aver-
age systolic and diastolic measurements were taken and in-
cluded as control variables. Finally, three dichotomous
covariates were included for medications that may affect
inflammation levels. Respondents were asked whether they
were regularly taking a list of prescription and nonprescrip-
tion medications, among which included lipid medications,
antihypertensive medications, or nonsteroidal antiinflam-
matory drugs.
Data Analysis
Analyses used ordinary least-squares regression to model
the natural log of CRP. In addition to an additive model with
the independent variables for SES and BMI, a series of in-
teraction models were estimated that multiply each indica-
torofSESbyBMI.Graphsarepresentedtoaidinterpretation.
Results
Table 1 displays the coding and descriptive statistics for
each variable stratified by education and by household net
worth. It is clear from Table 1 that CRP levels are higher
among people of low educational status and with low house-
hold net worth, about 0.7 units higher for persons of lower
status. BMI is also higher among the disadvantaged groups,
as are several health-related behaviors such as current to-
bacco use (low net worth group has higher levels), physical
activity, and heavy drinking behavior. Racial and ethnic mi-
norities are disproportionately represented in the low edu-
cation and low net-worth group, as are those who have
health troubles such as heart problems and diabetes, though
were was no significant difference in arthritis, emphysema,
chronic obstructive lung disease, or asthma prevalence be-
tween the groups. Those low in education and net worth
also rate their health as lower.
Having identified the health disparities between SES
groups, the next step is a multiple regression analysis of the
effects of SES and BMI on CRP. Adjusting for all of the
covariates, the ordinary least- squares regression results
shown in Table 2 reveal that each unit of BMI was associ-
ated with a 0.06 unit (p < .001) increase in the logged value
of CRP. The model also includes the additive effects of SES
and health behaviors. Respondents without a high school
degree had CRP levels 0.23 higher than those with a high
school or higher degree (p < .05). The additive effect of low
net worth, however, was nonsignificant. Of the health-re-
lated behaviors, each except drinking was significant at the
.001 level and associated with an increase in inflammation.
A number of other factors were statistically significant pre-
dictors: CRP was higher for women, persons with a poor
health rating, and those not taking a lipid medication. (In
supplementary analyses, we estimated the model on men
and women separately, but the results were quite similar.)
The final table extends the analysis by testing a series of
interaction terms (i.e., each indicator of SES multiplied by
BMI). Although only the main effects and interaction terms
are displayed, each equation adjusts for all variables in-
cluded in the Table 2 analysis. In each model, both interac-
tion terms were statistically significant and negative. To
interpret these results, one should first observe that BMI and
each main effect that is significant manifest a positive rela-
tionship with CRP: high BMI and low SES are associated
with elevated CRP. At the same time, each significant inter-
action reveals a negative effect: people in disadvantaged
social contexts derive less penalty for BMI on levels of in-
flammation. Stated differently, the noxious effect of the risk
factors remain but are leveled somewhat at the high levels of
BMI (Table 3).
In order to facilitate interpretation, two figures are pre-
sented showing the effects of BMI on CRP among the so-
cially disadvantaged groups relative to their higher status
counterparts. Figure 1 shows the relationship between CRP

and BMI stratified by education (high school degree). At the
lower end of the BMI distribution, respondents with less
education experienced higher predicted levels of CRP (ln)
per unit of body mass, but this pattern changed across
BMI's range, with a cross-over point at about 39. Thus,
among respondents whose BMI is near or above Class II
obesity threshold (BMI > 35), the CRP levels of the persons
with a high school degree actually exceed those without a
high school degree.
A parallel pattern is observed in Figure 2 for the interac-
tion of household net worth and BMI, but the intersection
point is much lower: 30.4. This means that among persons
who are more than the 30 BMI threshold, higher CRP levels
are observed among persons with higher net worth--the op-
posite of what is observed at the lower levels of BMI.
Discussion
Using a national sample of older adults, these analyses
showed that both low SES and high BMI are associated
with heightened levels of CRP, a key biomeasure for car-
diovascular disease (6,8,9). Although these fundamental
and proximal causes of disease, SES, and BMI, respec-
tively, are each a risk for heightened CRP, the actual impact
of each factor on CRP is best understood when considering
their conjoint influence. The association between BMI and
CRP was leveled somewhat for persons without a high
school education or with lower household net worth. These
findings support a hierarchy of risks explanation, suggest-
ing that because lower SES individuals are generally ex-
posed to more health risks, the unique contribution of
BMI for CRP levels is actually lower than for their more
advantaged counterparts. This further exemplifies the need
for a more complex understanding of the relationship be-
tween biomeasures of health and SES. No biological mech-

anism is currently available to explain this cross-over; the
explanation most likely lies in the interaction between
health, health behaviors, and SES.
Results are consistent with the analyses of Blaxter (17) of
adults in England, Wales, and Scotland that revealed how
unhealthy behaviors have the greatest effect "when the
social environment is good: rather less, if it is already
unhealthy. Unhealthy behaviour does not reinforce disad-
vantage to the same extent as healthy behaviour increases
advantage" (p. 233). This suggests that there may be dimin-
ishing returns for selected risk factors when they are consid-
ered in tandem with other risks, emphasizing a distinct
approach to the study of how risk factors accumulate.
SCHAFER ET AL.

Other studies, however, demonstrate amplified risk accu-
mulation between fundamental and proximal causes, such
as when disease risk and mortality are higher for smokers
with low SES (15) or when mortality risk due to physical
inactivity is highest among poorer people (16). Whereas we
found evidence of a leveling effect for the combined risks
on a different outcome, we articulate two inferences. First,
exploring a broad range of health outcomes is probably the
only way to identify the interactions between social and
physiological factors in older adult health because the
mechanisms of risk accumulation appear to be outcome
specific. Indeed, Rosero-Bixby and Dow (5) found support
for both amplification and leveling across an array of out-
comes. Second, regardless of the outcome considered, the
bulk of the extant evidence points to the utility of multipli-
cative models for studying how SES is related to health. A
presumption of additive effects in models of risk accumula-
tion may be misleading. Rather, multiplicative models are
supported in analyses on a range of outcomes and hold great
promise to advance our understanding of how education
and BMI jointly influence health outcomes (27).
An important limitation of this study is the cross-
sectional nature of the data. The older adults studied have
accumulated a lifetime of health-related experiences associ-
ated with their weight and stemming from their socioeco-
nomic position. Accordingly, relying on a single-moment
snapshot and treating two respondents with identical BMI
scores the same when in fact they may have widely diver-
gent lifetime weight trajectories is a limitation.
A second limitation is inherent in the population-based
design of this older sample. Those with the highest risk pro-
file for cardiovascular disease would be less likely to sur-
vive into their 70s and 80s, thereby making this sample
potentially biased towards older adults in relatively good
health. Though selection may bias the conclusions, we un-
covered considerable variability in CRP and a relatively
high rate of obesity within this sample.
In conclusion, these analyses built on prior studies of risk
accumulation in order to examine whether BMI exacerbates
or diminishes the health effects of more fundamental social
causes of disease (1). Using two indicators of SES, we
found evidence that BMI has its most risky association with
CRP among those who otherwise face fewer health risks.
This cross-over effect is an instance where class-based
health disparities are leveled--not magnified--by a known
risk factor. At the same time, it raises the significance for
identifying why CRP levels rise so dramatically among
obese persons of high SES.
