ABSTRACT
YY1 (Yin and Yang 1) is a multifunctional, ubiquitously
expressed, zinc finger protein that can act as a tran-
scriptional activator, repressor, or initiator element binding
protein. Previous studies have shown that YY1 modulates
the activity of reporter genes driven by the myelin PLP
(proteolipid protein) (PLP1/Plp1) promoter. However, it is
known that Plp1 intron 1 DNA contains regulatory elements
that are required for the dramatic increase in gene activity,
coincident with the active myelination period of CNS (central
nervous system) development. The intron in mouse contains
multiple prospective YY1 target sites including one within
a positive regulatory module called the ASE (anti-silencer/
enhancer) element. Results presented here demonstrate that
YY1 has a negative effect on the activity of a Plp1-lacZ fusion
gene [PLP(+)Z] in an immature oligodendroglial cell line (Oli-
neu) that is mediated through sequences present in Plp1
intron 1 DNA. Yet YY1 does not bind to its alleged site in the
ASE (even though the protein is capable of recognizing a
target site in the promoter), indicating that the down-
regulation of PLP(+)Z activity by YY1 in Oli-neu cells does
not occur through a direct interaction of YY1 with the ASE
sequence. Previous studies with Yy1 conditional knockout mice
have demonstrated that YY1 is essential for the differentiation
of oligodendrocyte progenitors. Nevertheless, the current study
suggests that YY1 functions as a repressor (not an activator) of
Plp1 gene expression in immature oligodendrocytes. Perhaps
YY1 functions to keep the levels of PLP in check in immature
cells before vast quantities of the protein are needed in mature
myelinating oligodendrocytes.
Key words: gene expression, gene regulation, myelin
proteolipid protein gene, Oli-neu cells, repression, YY1.
INTRODUCTION
YY1 (Yin and Yang 1) is a multifunctional, ubiquitously
expressed, zinc finger protein that can act as a transcriptional
activator, repressor, or initiator element binding protein (for
reviews see Shi et al., 1997; Thomas and Seto, 1999; Gordon
et al., 2006; He and Casaccia-Bonnefil, 2008). YY1 is present
in oligodendrocytes where it is localized to the nucleus (Rylski
et al., 2008). The protein has been shown to recognize a
target motif in the promoter of the human myelin PLP
(proteolipid protein) gene (PLP1) where it seemingly func-
tions as a transcriptional activator (Berndt et al., 2001). PLP1/
Plp1 gene expression is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner
and, in oligodendrocytes, is responsible for nearly half the
protein in CNS (central nervous system) myelin from adults
(reviewed in Wight and Dobretsova, 2004). Categorization of
YY1 as an activator of human PLP1 gene transcription stems
from studies by Berndt et al. showing that: (i) it binds
selectively to a YY1 target site located within a region of the
PLP1 promoter referred to as site 3 [positions 2130 to 2104
relative to the transcription start point (+1)] (Berndt et al.,
2001), which previously had been shown to bind nuclear
protein(s) in a sequence-specific manner (Berndt et al., 1992);
(ii) deletion­transfection analysis in glial cells using various
PLP1 promoter driven reporter constructs revealed a dramatic
decrease in reporter gene activity when site 3 was deleted
along with another, unrelated, protein binding site (site 2;
positions 276 to 250) (Berndt et al., 1992); (iii) the level of
expression of a PLP1-reporter gene construct that contains
PLP1 sequences from 21088 to +85 was increased when
human (SVG) or rat (CG4) glial cell lines were co-transfected
with a YY1 expression plasmid, but not with an analogous
construct having a mutant site 3 that disrupts YY1 binding
(Berndt et al., 2001). However, as noted by Berndt et al.
(1992), the same (unmutated) PLP1 sequence was not

effective in driving expression of a reporter gene in transgenic
mice (Gout et al., 1991), whereas a related transgene that
contains nearly 4.2 kb of 59-flanking DNA could do so (Nadon
et al., 1989, 1994). Discrepancies between the outcomes with
transfection and transgenic approaches have been noted
for other genes as well (Zimmerman et al., 1990; Kitsis and
Leinwand, 1992; Donoviel et al., 1996), and may be due to
differences in the chromatin status of the construct itself, or
to inherent differences in the cells themselves.
The current study was undertaken to evaluate the role of
YY1 in regulating mouse Plp1 gene activity. The structure
of the gene in mouse and man is quite similar (reviewed in
Wight and Dobretsova, 2004). The 59-flanking DNA is highly
conserved between the two species, demonstrating 50%
identity for the proximal 1.3 kb of sequence and 91% identity
among the initial 135 nucleotides using the algorithm of Myers
and Miller (1988). Moreover, the sequence orthologous to site
3 in the mouse Plp1 gene [positions 2132 to 2106 based
on the numbering system by Macklin et al. (1987)] is highly
conserved, having 93% identity with the human sequence.
Within this sequence there is an exact match to a high affinity
CCAT core YY1 target site (consensus5 VDCCATNWY) (Yant
et al., 1995) that is identical to the corresponding sequence in
man. However, unlike the case when the human PLP1 promoter
was used to drive a reporter gene in glial cell lines (Berndt et al.,
1992), deletion of `site 3' from the mouse Plp1 promoter did
not cause a major diminution in the levels of reporter gene
activity (Wight et al., 1997), suggesting that this sequence does
not function as a positive regulatory element in mouse. More
recently it has been shown that overexpression of YY1 in the
immortalized mouse oligodendroglial cell line, Oli-neu, causes
a dose-dependent decrease in mouse Plp1 promoter driven
reporter gene activity when the cells were kept proliferating in
growth medium (ODM) and 1% horse serum (He et al., 2007a).
However, YY1 overexpression did not lead to a significant
change in reporter gene activity when the cells were pressed
to differentiate by dibutyryl cAMP treatment the day fol-
lowing transfection, except perhaps for a slight decrease
with the highest amount (2 mg/well) of YY1 plasmid (He et al.,
2007a). Thus, if anything, the mouse counterpart to site 3
(termed prom 3) appears to function as a negative regulatory
element.
While the aforementioned studies have focused on effects
of YY1 via regulatory sequences within the promoter and
adjoining 59-flanking DNA, the first intron of the mouse Plp1
gene also contains many prospective YY1 binding sites (Wight
and Dobretsova, 1997). Transgenic mouse studies (Li et al.,
2002b) have shown that inclusion of Plp1 intron 1 DNA in
Plp1-lacZ fusion genes is critical to attain high levels of
expression in brain during the active myelination period
of CNS development, in keeping with the temporal pattern
exhibited by the endogenous Plp1 gene. Transfection analysis
using a battery of Plp1-lacZ constructs containing partial
deletion of Plp1 intron 1 DNA revealed the presence of a
single positive-regulatory element within the intron that is
active in N20.1 cells (Dobretsova and Wight, 1999). Besides
being able to overcome (or counterbalance) the effects from
negative-regulatory elements located elsewhere in the intron,
the positive-regulatory element functions as an enhancer in
N20.1 cells (Dobretsova et al., 2000; Meng et al., 2005). Thus,
we designated the positive regulatory element ASE (anti-
silencer/enhancer). The ASE has been minimally mapped to
mouse Plp1 intron 1 positions 1093­1177 (Dobretsova et al.,
2004) and contains an exact match to a high affinity YY1
target site (consensus5VDCCATNWY; Yant et al., 1995) spanning
intron 1 positions 1137­1145. The intron also contains nine
other potential YY1 binding sites with exact matches to the
CCAT core consensus sequence. To address the effects that these
sites might play in modulating Plp1 gene expression, transfec-
tion analysis was performed in Oli-neu cells with Plp1-lacZ
fusion genes containing all, some, or none of mouse Plp1 intron
1 DNA. Oli-neu cells were used for this study because they are
slightly more mature than N20.1 cells, based on the relative
amounts and types of splice variants expressed by several myelin
genes including Plp1 (Pereira et al., 2011). In some experiments
cells were co-transfected with an expression construct to
increase the levels of YY1. Here we report that inclusion of Plp1
intron 1 DNA greatly enhances the levels of Plp1-driven lacZ
expression in Oli-neu cells. The increase in expression is largely
attributable to the ASE regulatory element. However, over-
expression of YY1 mitigates this response, apparently through an
indirect mechanism. YY1 did not bind to the alleged target motif
in the ASE as determined by gel shift analysis, although it did to
a target site in prom 3 from the promoter. Both the ASE and
prom 3 contain an exact match to the YY1 consensus sequence
(VDCCATNWY). Therefore, the YY1 consensus sequence can be
refined further based on differences in the sequence between
ASE and prom 3.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Dr Patrizia Casaccia (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) gene-
rously provided the mouse Oli-neu cell line (Jung et al., 1995)
with permission from Dr. Jacqueline Trotter (University of
Mainz). The Oli-neu cell line was derived by immortalization
of primary cultures of enriched oligodendrocytes with the
t-neu oncogene. Oli-neu cells were grown at 37°C in SATO
medium devoid of mitogens (ODM) according to the modi-
fications by He et al. (2007a) and supplemented with 1%
horse serum. Oli-neu cells were maintained in an atmosphere
of 10% CO2
. The mouse N20.1 cell line (Verity et al., 1993)
was derived by immortalization of primary cultures of en-
riched oligodendrocytes with a temperature-sensitive form of
SV40 large T antigen. N20.1 cells were grown at 34°C in
DMEM/F-12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/Ham's F-12
nutrient mixture; Invitrogen) supplemented with 15 mM
Hepes, 2.438 g/l of sodium bicarbonate, 4 g/l of glucose, 100

Plasmids
Details regarding the construction of PLP(+)Z (Wight et al.,
1993), PLP(2)Z (Wight and Dobretsova, 1997), and the
Plp1 intron 1 partial deletion constructs, PLPD12-8068 and
PLPD809­5807 (Dobretsova and Wight, 1999), have been
described previously. The constructs utilize the mouse Plp1
promoter and associated sequences to drive expression of the
lacZ reporter gene. Every Plp1-lacZ construct contains the pro-
ximal 2.4 kb of Plp1 59-flanking DNA, all of exon 1 DNA, and the
first 37 bp of exon 2. PLP(+)Z also contains all of Plp1 intron 1
DNA, whereas PLP(2)Z lacks the intron altogether. The
corresponding partial deletion constructs contain some of
Plp1 intron 1 DNA and were named according to the deleted
intronic sequence. For instance, PLPD809­5807 is missing Plp1
intron 1 DNA from positions 809­5807 based upon numbering
the entire intron from positions 1­8140 (Wight and Dobretsova,
1997). Plasmid PLPD809­5807 +F(-AP4) (Dobretsova et al.,
2004) contains the ASE sequence (Plp1 intron 1 positions 1093­
1177) inserted into the PstI site at the deletion­junction site of
PLPD809­5807 in the native (forward; F) orientation, and is
referred to here as PLPD809­5807+ASE-F for purposes of
clarity.
F-YY1 (FLAG-tagged YY1) was expressed from the plasmid
pCEP4F-YY1 (Yao et al., 2001), which contains a cDNA for
human YY1 immediately downstream of the CMV (cyto-
megalovirus) promoter in pCEP4F (Zhu et al., 1995). The
tagged protein contains a single copy of the FLAG epitope at
its N-terminus.
Transfection analysis
Oli-neu cells were seeded at a density of 16105 cells per 35-
mm well (six-well dishes, Costar) the day prior to transfection.
Cells were transfected with an equimolar amount of a given
Plp1-lacZ construct and a fixed amount (0.35 mg/well) of a
plasmid [RSVL (Rous sarcoma virus-luciferase)] containing the
luciferase reporter gene under control of the LTR (long terminal
repeat) promoter of RSV (rous sarcoma virus) to monitor for
differences in transfection efficiency. Empty vector (pBluescript
SK+; Stratagene) was added to bring the total amount of DNA
to 3 mg per well. Each Plp1-lacZ construct was transfected in
duplicate per experiment. In some cases, pCEP4F-YY1 was
included as well. Cells were transfected using the FuGENETM 6
Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) according
to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, 4.5 ml of the
FuGENETM 6 Reagent was mixed with 95.5 ml of DMEM (with-
out serum) before adding plasmid DNA (3 mg total in 16.7 ml of
sterile water). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room
temperature and then added directly to the culture medium of
an individual well. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-DNA
addition in 190 ml of Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega). The
Galacto-Light Plus Kit (Applied Biosystems) and Luciferase
Assay System (Promega) were used to determine the relative
levels for b-gal (b-galactosidase) and luciferase activity,
respectively, as described earlier (Dobretsova and Wight,
1999). Luminescence was detected using an AutoLumat LB
953 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) as RLU (relative light
units). Values for b-gal activity were corrected for differences
in transfection efficiency first by subtracting the amount of
background luminescence inherent in the b-gal and luciferase
assays as determined by the RLU generated in lysates prepared
from cells transfected with pBluescript SK+ alone, and then
by adjusting the b-gal RLU in proportion to a set amount
(26106 RLU) of luciferase activity. Results are presented as the
means¡S.D. of b-gal activity relative to that obtained for
PLP(2)Z transfected cells, which was arbitrarily set at 1 (fold)
in every experiment, and were calculated from at least three
independent experiments. Alternatively, Oli-neu cells were
transfected with pCEP4F-YY1 (0.1 mg/well) and pBluescript SK+
(2.9 mg/well) and nuclear extracts prepared 48 h post-DNA
addition for subsequent use in EMSA (electrophoretic mobility
shift assay) and Western-blot analysis. Statistical analyses were
performed using the ANOVA module from SigmaPlot 11 (Systat
Software Inc.).
Nuclear extracts
Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells (Oli-neu, N20.1,
and HeLa) grown to ,80% confluence in 162 cm2 flasks by
the methods of Dignam et al. (1983). In some cases, nuclear
extracts were prepared from 10 six-well plates of Oli-neu
cells that had been transfected 48 h earlier with pCEP4F-YY1
(0.1 mg/well) and pBluescript SK+ (2.9 mg/well).
EMSA
EMSA analysis was performed as previously described
(Dobretsova and Wight, 1999). EMSA probes were generated
from synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (27-mers)
that were radiolabelled using [c-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer) and T4
polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). The sequence for
one strand of each oligonucleotide is shown in Table 1 relative
to a prospective YY1 binding site (consensus5VDCCATNWY).
YY1 consensus and mutant oligonucleotides were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse Plp1-specific oligonu-
cleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies.
Prom 3 is orthologous to the human site 3 oligonucleotide
used in an earlier study (Berndt et al., 2001) and spans the
mouse Plp1 promoter from positions 2132 to 2106 based on
the numbering system utilized by Macklin et al. (1987). Prom
1 corresponds to Plp1 59-flanking DNA positions 21596 to
21570 and contains two mismatches compared with the
VDCCATNWY consensus, while still maintaining the CCAT core.

The 1128­1154 double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponds
to Plp1 intron 1 DNA position 1128­1154 (Wight and Dobretsova,
1997). Binding reactions for EMSA were assembled at room
temperature in a total volume of 20 ml and consisted of
1­4 mg protein [nuclear extract alone or 0.1 mg 68 kDa YY1
polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology) plus 3.9 mg BSA], 1­2 mg poly(dI-dC) N (dI-dC) and
2­46104 c.p.m. of labelled probe in a solution of 10 mM Tris/
HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol and 1 mM
DTT (dithiothreitol). Some reactions also contained unlabelled
`competitor' DNA at 50-, 100- or 200-fold molar excess
over the probe. DNA­protein complexes were resolved on
non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by
autoradiography.
Western-blot analysis
Proteins (10 mg from nuclear extracts) were denatured by
heat (95°C for 5 min) in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS,
10% glycerol, 0.1% Bromophenol Blue and 100 mM DTT (gel
loading buffer). Proteins were fractionated on an SDS/PAGE
gel (7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide) and subsequently trans-
ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran BA-S 85,
Schleicher & Schuell) using the Mini Trans-Blot Electro-
phoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 100 V. Proteins
were visualized by staining with Ponceau Red [0.1% (w/v) of
Ponceau S (Sigma­Aldrich) in 5% acetic acid]. Membranes
were subsequently destained and then blocked with 10%
(w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in TBST (Tris-
buffered saline with Tween-20; 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150
mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature
and washed three times (5 min each) in TBST. Membranes
were incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-YY1
(H-10) antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
anti-FLAG M2 antibody (10 mg/ml; Sigma­Aldrich) in TBST
containing 3% BSA. Membranes were washed three times
(5 min each) in TBST followed by incubation with secondary
antibodies [HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated donkey
anti-mouse IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories]
diluted 1:5000 or 1:10000 in TBST with 5% non-fat dried
skimmed milk powder. Membranes were washed three times
(10 min each) in TBST and immunoreactive bands visualized
using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer).
RESULTS
The presence of Plp1 intron 1 DNA greatly
increases the level of Plp1-lacZ expression in
Oli-neu cells, which is mitigated by elevated
levels of YY1
Previous studies with Plp1-lacZ transgenic mice (Wight et al.,
1993; Li et al., 2002b) have shown that inclusion of Plp1
intron 1 DNA in the transgene is crucial to attain a robust
developmental increase in b-gal activity in brain, concurrent
with the active myelination period of CNS development. In
particular, the PLP(+)Z transgene depicted in Figure 1, which
utilizes Plp1 genomic DNA [proximal 2.4 kb of 59-flanking
DNA downstream to the first 37 bp of exon 2] to drive lacZ
reporter gene expression, is temporally regulated in brain
similar to that of the endogenous Plp1 gene. However, the
developmental increase that is normally reached during
the active myelination period is severely attenuated when
Plp1 intron 1 DNA is omitted from the transgene [PLP(2)Z
construct depicted in Figure 1].
Deletion-transfection analysis with constructs equivalent
to PLP(+)Z aside from missing a portion of Plp1 intron 1 has
identified a single positive regulatory element (ASE) and
multiple negative regulatory elements that are functional in
N20.1 cells (Dobretsova and Wight, 1999; Li et al., 2002a;
Dobretsova et al., 2004). The cumulative effects of these
regulatory elements are counterbalanced in N20.1 cells,
hence PLP(+)Z and PLP(2)Z yield relatively similar levels of b-
gal activity in transfected cells. However, as shown in
Figure 2, the relative levels of b-gal activity in transfected
Oli-neu cells is much greater for PLP(+)Z (,50-fold higher)
than PLP(2)Z. To test the effects that increased levels of YY1
might have on this ratio, Oli-neu cells were co-transfected
with a YY1 expression plasmid (pCEP4F-YY1). Elevated levels
of YY1, via co-transfection with only 0.025 mg pCEP4F-YY1,
caused a dramatic drop in the b-gal activity for PLP(+)Z,
which was not significantly different from that obtained with
PLP(2)Z (Figure 2). Increased amounts of YY1 plasmid led
to a further decrease, in a dose-dependent manner. Because
PLP(+)Z and PLP(2)Z are the same except for the presence or
absence of Plp1 intron 1 DNA respectively the drop in b-gal

activity for PLP(+)Z in the midst of elevated YY1 levels must
be mediated through regulatory element(s) in the intron.
YY1 overexpression impairs ASE function
As noted earlier, the intron contains multiple potential YY1
binding sites, one of which is situated within the ASE. It is
possible that overexpression of YY1 may interfere with the
binding of a requisite activator whose recognition site
overlaps or abuts the putative YY1 target site in the ASE.
To test this supposition, Oli-neu cells were co-transfected
with equimolar amounts of a given Plp1-lacZ construct in the
presence or absence of pCEP4F-YY1; 0.1 mg pCEP4F-YY1 was
chosen since further decreases in PLP(+)Z gene activity with
higher amounts of YY1 plasmid were minimal (Figure 2). b-
gal activities are reported as the fold amount relative to that
obtained with PLP(2)Z (arbitrarily set at 1) and compared
only among the same backdrop of YY1 levels (normal or
elevated). Similar to the results presented in Figure 2,
overexpression of YY1 led to a significant decrease in the
relative levels of b-gal activity in PLP(+)Z transfected cells
compared with those transfected with PLP(2)Z (Figure 3).
Removal of Plp1 intron 1 sequence from positions 12­8068
[PLPD12­8068] or positions 809­5807 [PLPD809­5807]
resulted in a dramatic decrease in the levels of b-gal activity
compared with PLP(+)Z transfected cells containing endogen-
ous levels of YY1 (i.e. not co-transfected with pCEP4F-YY1).
Reinstatement of the ASE (positions 1093­1177) into the
deletion­junction site of PLPD809­5807 [PLPD809­5807+ASE-
F] was able to fully restore the levels of b-gal activity back to
those obtained with PLP(+)Z (Figure 3). However, overexpres-
sion of YY1 caused a significant decrease in the levels of b-gal
activity obtained with the PLPD809­5807+ASE-F construct
(Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, the amount of nuclear YY1
produced by the YY1 expression plasmid exceeded the
endogenous level, and was discernible by an increase in
molecular weight on account of the FLAG tag. Taken together,
these data suggest that overexpression of YY1 has a negative
effect on the action of the ASE in Oli-neu cells.
YY1 levels are similar in Oli-neu and N20.1
oligodendroglial cell lines
Because the ASE appears far more potent in Oli-neu cells
compared with N20.1 cells [b-gal activity of PLPD809­
5807+ASE-F transfected cells compared with PLP(2)Z was
Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the mouse Plp1 gene and related Plp1-lacZ constructs
The mouse Plp1 gene is shown at the top and contains seven major exons (black boxes) that span 15.6 kb of DNA. There are also a
couple of minor alternatively spliced exons (located in intron 1) that are not illustrated. The transcription start point is indicated
by a bent arrow near the end of exon 1. A positive regulatory element called the ASE (green star) is located within the first intron at
positions 1093­1177 (Dobretsova et al., 2004), based upon numbering the entire intron from positions 1­8140 (Wight and
Dobretsova, 1997). Plp1-lacZ constructs pertinent to this study are depicted directly below the gene. All constructs contain 2.4 kb of
mouse Plp1 59-flanking DNA, exon 1 and the first 37 bp of exon 2, which is fused (in-frame) to a lacZ expression cassette (blue box).
In addition, PLP(+)Z also contains all of Plp1 intron 1 DNA, whereas PLP(2)Z is missing the intron altogether. The intron 1 partial
deletion constructs contain a portion of Plp1 intron 1 DNA and were named accordingly. For instance, PLPD809­5807 is missing
intron 1 positions 809­5807, which was generated by the removal of two PstI (P) fragments from PLP(+)Z. PLPD809­807+ASE-F (not
separately illustrated) contains the ASE sequence (positions 1093­1177) inserted at the deletion junction site (P) of PLPD809­5807
in the native (forward; F) orientation. Besides PLPD809­807+ASE-F, the only other construct which contains the ASE is PLP(+)Z.

PLP(+)Z gene activity relative to that for PLP(2)Z in a dose-dependent
manner
Oli-neu cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of a particular Plp1-
lacZ construct in the presence or absence of the YY1 expression plasmid,
pCEP4F-YY1 (Yao et al., 2001), along with a fixed amount of RSVL to correct
for differences in transfection efficiency. Transfection results represent the
-fold change in the means¡S.D. of b-gal activity (n>6) for PLP(+)Z relative
to PLP(2)Z, which was arbitrarily set at 1 in every experiment for each
amount of pCEP4F-YY1 tested. Comparisons are made only among similar
states of YY1 expression (i.e. same amount of transfected pCEP4F-YY1).

approximately 75-fold higher in Oli-neu cells (Figure 3), while
only 2-fold higher in N20.1 cells as previously shown
(Dobretsova et al., 2004)] it is possible that the two cell lines
have different amounts of YY1, which in turn leads to higher
levels of Plp1 gene expression in Oli-neu cells compared with
N20.1 cells (Pereira et al., 2011). However, as shown in
Figure 5, endogenous levels of YY1 in the nucleus are similar
between Oli-neu and N20.1 cells, and even HeLa cells.
Therefore the difference between the apparent potency of
the ASE in Oli-neu and N20.1 cells cannot be explained by
disparate levels of nuclear YY1.
YY1 binds to a motif in the mouse Plp1 promoter,
but not to the ASE
PCR assisted binding site selection has been used to define
high-affinity YY1 binding motifs (Yant et al., 1995). The vast
majority of high-affinity binding sites selected contained a
core sequence of CCAT, although a few possessed a core
sequence of ACAT. The consensus sequence, VDCCATNWY, was
found to fit 89% of the selected CCAT-containing oligonu-
cleotides (Yant et al., 1995). EMSA analysis was performed to
test whether YY1 is capable of binding specifically to such
recognition motifs present in the Plp1 gene. As shown in
Figure 6, a prominent DNA­protein complex was formed
when nuclear proteins from Oli-neu cells were incubated with
a positive control probe containing a single YY1 (consensus)
binding site (lane 7). The complex was diminished by the
addition of unlabelled homologous DNA (lanes 8­9), but not
with a related mutant oligonucleotide (mut YY1) whose YY1
target site is disrupted (lanes 10­11). Furthermore, unlabelled
prom 3 oligonucleotide (lanes 12­13), which corresponds
to mouse Plp1 promoter sequence from positions 2132 to
2106, could also compete for binding. Prom 3 is the mouse
Figure 3 YY1 has a negative effect on ASE function in Oli-neu cells
Oli-neu cells were co-transfected with an equimolar amount of the indicated
Plp1-lacZ construct (see Figure 1 for further details) and a fixed amount of
RSVL to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. In some cases, 0.1
mg pCEP4F-YY1 was also included. Results represent the fold change in the
means¡S.D. of b-gal activity (n514) relative to that obtained with PLP(2)Z
(arbitrarily set at 1 for each experiment), and compared only among
equivalent states of YY1 expression. *Significant difference (P,0.001)

Figure 4 Transfection of Oli-neu cells with pCEP4F-YY1 results in
relatively high levels of nuclear YY1, which exceed endogenous levels
Nuclear extracts were prepared from Oli-neu cells transfected with
pCEP4F-YY1 (0.1 mg/well) 48 h earlier, or untransfected cells, and sub-
sequently analysed for the presence of the YY1 protein (left panel)
and the FLAG epitope (right panel) by Western-blot analysis. A total of
10 mg nuclear proteins were loaded per lane. The YY1 protein encoded by
pCEP4F-YY1 contains a single copy of the FLAG epitope at its N-terminus
(F-YY1), thereby increasing its molecular weight relative to the endogenous
(YY1) protein.
Figure 5 Oli-neu, N20.1 and HeLa cells contain comparable levels of
nuclear YY1
Western blot analysis was performed using nuclear extracts prepared from
Oli-neu, N20.1 and HeLa cells. Two independent isolations of nuclear extracts
were tested for Oli-neu cells. An equal amount of nuclear proteins (10 mg)
were loaded per lane; staining of the membrane with Ponceau Red indicated
that the lanes contained comparable amounts of protein. Results show that
the levels of nuclear YY1 are similar between the cell lines.

equivalent of a human-based oligonucleotide that previously
was shown to bind YY1 at site 3 in the PLP1 promoter (Berndt
et al., 2001), and fulfils the YY1 consensus. Likewise, when
prom 3 was used as a probe, a similarly sized EMSA complex
was formed (lane 14), which could be competed for by
the addition of unlabelled YY1 consensus oligonucleotide,
suggesting that YY1 can bind to this region of the mouse Plp1
promoter. However, when an upstream oligonucleotide (prom
1) was tested that corresponds to mouse Plp1 59-flanking
DNA positions 21596 to 21570 and contains a CCAT core
but two mismatches relative to the YY1 consensus, no DNA­
protein complex was formed (lane 2). Hence, sequences
flanking the CCAT core are also critical for YY1 binding.
EMSA analysis was also performed with nuclear extracts
from Oli-neu cells that had been transfected with pCEP4F-
YY1 two days earlier. As shown in Figure 7, there was
enrichment of the EMSA sequence-specific complex formed
by the YY1 consensus and prom 3 probes with nuclear
extracts prepared from transfected cells (compare lanes 2
with 3, and 8 with 9), which were effectively diminished
by addition of the YY1 consensus oligonucleotide as an
unlabelled (cold) competitor (lanes 4 and 11). Incubation of
the probes with 100 mg full-length human YY1 protein
(produced in Escherichia coli as a 68 kDa polyhistidine
tagged-fusion protein) led to an EMSA complex of nearly
similar mobility whose level was greatly diminished by
addition of unlabelled `homologous' DNA (compare lanes 5
with 6, and 12 with 13). (The mobility of the EMSA complex
formed with the purified YY1 protein was slightly retarded
presumably due to the addition of the polyhistidine tag.)
However, an EMSA complex was not formed between the
purified YY1 protein and the 1128­1154 probe (lane 19) that
contains a potential YY1 binding motif within the ASE
sequence that fits the YY1 consensus exactly. Furthermore,
even though some nuclear proteins from Oli-neu cells seem
to recognize the 1128­1154 probe in a sequence-specific
manner (compare lane 16 with lanes 17 and 18), it is not due
to YY1 since the level of EMSA complexes remained unchanged
when nuclear extracts from pCEP4F-YY1 transfected cells
were tested (compare lanes 15 and 16), which was not diminished
by the addition of unlabelled YY1 consensus oligonucleotide
as a possible competitor (lane 18). Taken together, these
results indicate that YY1 does not bind directly to the ASE
sequence.
DISCUSSION
Past transfection studies (Berndt et al., 2001; He et al., 2007a)
that tested the consequences of YY1 overexpression on the
Figure 6 YY1 may recognize a target site within the mouse Plp1 promoter (prom 3)
EMSA analysis was performed with the indicated 32P-labelled probes and, in some instances, unlabelled DNA as a possible `cold'
(unlabelled) competitor (50- or 100-fold molar excess over the probe). See Table 1 for sequences of the oligonucleotides (27-mers)
and their putative YY1 target sites. EMSA reactions with the prom 1 (lanes 1­6) and YY1 (lanes 7­13) probes contained a higher
amount of radioactivity (46104 c.p.m.) than those with the prom 3 probe (26104 c.p.m.; lanes 14­18). Nuclear extract prepared
from Oli-neu cells was included in all reactions (1.17 mg nuclear proteins/reaction; lanes 2­18) except for the sample in lane 1 (probe
alone). Arrow points to a specific DNA­protein complex formed with the YY1 consensus and prom 3 probes.

regulation of PLP1/Plp1 gene expression have focused largely
on effects mediated through sequences in the promoter and
upstream 59-flanking DNA. Yet YY1 has been shown to bind
to target sites within the first intron of (other) genes and
either activate (Kim et al., 2003, 2006, Foti and Reichardt,
2004) or repress (Yan et al., 2001; Zabel et al., 2002) their
expression. Because mouse Plp1 intron 1 DNA contains mul-
tiple putative YY1 binding sites (Wight and Dobretsova, 1997)
and is essential for the generation of high levels of Plp1-lacZ
transgene expression in brain during the active myelination
period of CNS development (Li et al., 2002b), effects from
elevated levels of YY1 on Plp1-lacZ gene activity via Plp1
intron 1 sequences were investigated in the current study.
Previously it has been shown that targeted ablation of Yy1
in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through the use of Cnp-
cre mice results in hypomyelination and cells being arrested
at an immature stage (He et al., 2007a). The impediment in
development is likely due to an inability to transcriptionally
down-regulate the expression of oligodendrocyte differenti-
ation inhibitors such as Id4, Tcf4 and Hes5 (He et al., 2007a;
Shen et al., 2008); YY1 recruits HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1)
to the promoters of these inhibitors during oligodendrocyte
progenitor differentiation causing `repression of repressors',
which in turn is required for differentiation to progress (He
et al., 2007b). Concomitantly, there is an 80% reduction in
mRNA levels for Plp1, MAG (myelin-associated glycoprotein),
and UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase (Ugt8) in
the brains of YY1 conditional knockout mice at postnatal day
18 (He et al., 2007a), presumably due to a failure in
oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation.
On the other hand, YY1 overexpression in glial cells via
transfection has produced a variety of effects, some of which
are contradictory. Endogenous levels of Plp1 gene transcripts
in primary cultures of oligodendrocyte progenitors were
largely unchanged when transfected with different amounts
(0.5, 1 and 2 mg) of a plasmid (pCX-yy1) which expresses human
YY1 (He et al., 2007a). However, it is unclear exactly what
the transfection efficiency was in those experiments. If the
efficiency was relatively low, then any changes in Plp1 gene
expression due to the elevation in YY1 levels would likely have
been obscured by the high background of untransfected cells.
Consequently, most studies have utilized Plp1-reporter gene
constructs co-transfected with YY1 expression plasmids to
determine how YY1 modulates Plp1 gene activity. Ideally,
another reporter plasmid such as RSVL would also be included
in order to correct for differences in transfection efficiency
between samples.
In the present study, where differences in transfection
efficiency have been accounted for, overexpression of YY1 in
Oli-neu cells caused a decrease in PLP(+)Z expression relative
to that for PLP(2)Z (Figure 2). Given that both Plp1-lacZ
constructs are equivalent except for the addition of Plp1
intron 1 DNA in PLP(+)Z, the down-regulation of PLP(+)Z
expression must have been mediated through regulatory
Figure 7 YY1 does not bind directly to the ASE sequence, but does to a motif in the mouse Plp1 promoter
EMSA analysis was performed with the indicated 32P-labelled probes (46104 c.p.m./reaction). Unlabeled DNA (200-fold molar
excess) was added to some reactions as a potential `cold' competitor. See Table 1 for sequences of the oligonucleotides (double-
stranded 27-mers). The respective probes were incubated either with nuclear extracts (4 mg nuclear proteins/reaction) prepared from
untransfected (lanes 2, 8, 15) or pCEP4F-YY1 transfected (lanes 3­4, 9­11, 16­18) Oli-neu cells, or with purified polyhistidine tagged
(human) YY1 protein (lanes 5­6, 12­13, 19­20), except for the samples in lanes 1, 7, and 13 (probe alone). Asterisks indicate nuclear
extract prepared from transfected cells, which is the same as that used for the Western-blot analysis shown in Figure 4. Arrow points
to a specific DNA­protein complex formed by nuclear proteins (most probably YY1) binding to the YY1 consensus and prom 3 probes.
Reactions containing purified YY1 also formed a complex with slightly reduced mobility due to inclusion of a polyhistidine tag on the
protein.

element(s) from the intron. Indeed, activity of the ASE (a very
potent enhancer in Oli-neu cells) was thwarted by elevated
levels of YY1 (compare the relative b-gal activities for
PLPD809­5807+ASE-F in Oli-neu cells transfected with or
without the YY1 expression plasmid in Figure 3). However,
even though the ASE contains a potential YY1 binding motif
that complies exactly with the VDCCATNWY consensus, YY1
did not bind to this sequence, although it could to another fit
situated in the promoter (prom 3; Figure 6) analogous to the
circumstances with site 3 in the human PLP1 promoter
(Berndt et al., 2001). [Analysis of the mouse Plp1 sequence
using MatInspector (Cartharius et al., 2005) revealed a YY1
motif in the sequence for prom 3, but not the ASE, using the
consensus sequence CGCCATNTT as defined by Kim et al.
(2007). Because both the prom 3 and 1128­1154 oligonu-
cleotides contain a mismatch at position 2 compared with the
CGCCATNTT consensus, but only the 1128­1154 oligonucleo-
tide contains an additional mismatch (TRC) at the last
position, it is likely that the terminal thymidine residue is
important for YY1 binding.] Hence elevated levels of YY1
appear to counter ASE function (albeit not through direct
binding to the ASE sequence itself), and consequently down-
regulate Plp1-lacZ gene activity in Oli-neu cells. As well, YY1
overexpression in Oli-neu cells has been shown to have a
negative effect on the activity of a reporter gene whose
expression is driven wholly by the mouse Plp1 promoter (and
associated 59-flanking DNA) (He et al., 2007a). Thus,
expression of the mouse Plp1 gene appears to be negatively
affected by YY1. Curiously, the human promoter was
positively regulated by YY1 in CG4 cells (rat oligodendroglial
cell line), although increasing the amounts of YY1 plasmid
transfected was inversely correlated with reporter gene
activity (PLP1-CAT activity/mg protein) that had not been
corrected for any deviations in transfection efficiency (Berndt
et al., 2001). Whether these seemingly incongruent findings
are the result of differences in the host cell (Oli-neu vs. CG4)
and/or the relative amount of YY1 plasmid transfected to
Plp1-reporter construct, or simply misleading because varia-
tions in transfection efficiency had not been accounted for in
some studies, or truly due to a species-specific difference
in the gene's regulation is presently unknown. Nonetheless,
down-regulation of mouse Plp1 driven reporter gene expression
by YY1 is in line with the results obtained from mice with
conditional ablation of yy1 in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. He
et al. (2007a) demonstrated that YY1 expression is necessary for
oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation. Presumably, YY1 is
required to repress expression of terminal differentiation
inhibitors. When oligodendrocyte progenitors isolated from
the cortex of neonatal Yy1floxed/floxed mice were transduced with
a CMV-Cre adenoviral vector and subsequently encouraged to
differentiate by mitogen withdrawal, PLP immunoreactivity was
much decreased in the YY1 ablated cells because they failed to
differentiate. However, this does not mean, a priori, that YY1 is
an activator of mouse Plp1 gene expression. In fact, our results
and those of He et al., (2007a) suggest that YY1 negatively
influences its expression through sequences in Plp1 intron 1 and
the promoter, respectively. Yet, when Oli-neu cells are pressed to
differentiate, elevated levels of YY1 did not significantly alter
the activity of a mouse Plp1 promoter-luciferase construct
except for possibly a slight decrease with the highest amount
(2 mg/well) of YY1 plasmid tested (He et al., 2007a). Thus the
repressive effect of YY1 on Plp1 gene expression appears to
lessen (or be lost) as the cells move through the latter stages of
differentiation. Perhaps YY1 helps to keep Plp1 gene activity
levels in check in immature cells before copious quantities of
PLP are needed in myelinating oligodendrocytes.
Taken together, our results and those of others (He et al.,
2007a) suggest that YY1 has a negative effect on mouse Plp1
gene expression in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and im-
mature oligodendrocytes. The decrease in Plp1 gene activity
caused by YY1 is mediated in part through sequences present in
the first intron, and with respect to the ASE does not occur via
direct recognition of a YY1 target site. Perhaps elevated levels
of YY1 cause a decrease in the expression of one or more of the
activators that form a complex on the ASE. Alternatively, YY1
overexpression could diminish ASE activity by having an effect
on the posttranslational modification of an ASE constituent, or
bind via a protein­protein interaction and subsequently recruit
a negative regulatory factor to the ASE complex. No matter
what, this is above and beyond any effect mediated through
the promoter (e.g. prom 3) since all of the Plp1-lacZ constructs
used in the present study contain the same Plp1 59-flanking
DNA. It is worth mentioning that this effect was observed in the
face of proportionately much less transfected YY1 plasmid
compared with studies (Berndt et al., 2001; He et al., 2007a)
that focused solely on the PLP1/Plp1 promoter (and adjacent
59-flanking DNA). In summary, YY1 appears to function as a
negative regulator of mouse Plp1 gene activity via multiple
regions of the gene, including the first intron.
