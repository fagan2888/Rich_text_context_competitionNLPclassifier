Abstract
Countries that rely on natural resource rents (that is, the revenue generated from the sale
of natural resources) may suffer from a variety of social problems. This exploratory study
reviews the natural resource extraction literature to derive a `natural resource rents­homicide'
hypothesis. Data for 173 countries for the years 2000 to 2012 are examined to determine if
there is a correlation between natural resource rents and homicide rates. Multilevel growth
models suggest that natural resource rents are positively correlated with homicide rates within
countries (level 1) but not between them (level 2). Importantly, the correlation between natural
resource rents and homicide is strongest when natural resource rents are lagged. We conclude
by suggesting that increasing natural resource rents may be counterproductive over the long run
and sow the seeds for a future increase in homicide.

Introduction
Recent studies have found that excessive dependence on natural resource extraction rev-
enue tends to be associated with elevated levels of crime in local settings (for example,
Archbold et al., 2014; Carrington et al., 2011; Price et al., 2014; Ruddell, 2011; Ruddell
et al., 2014). The major implication of these studies is that higher rates of crime are the
result of detrimental social processes that are set in motion by a sudden increase in
extraction development followed by a heavy reliance on revenue generated from natural
resources. As yet, however, community-level findings that postulate a relationship
between natural resource revenue and crime have not been replicated cross-nationally
(except see Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). This observation raises the following question:
is there a cross-national correlation between revenue that is generated by natural resource
extraction and crime? To help answer this question we study one type of crime (that is,
homicide rates) and natural resource rents. Homicide is one of the most valid and reliable
cross-national crime indicators (see Neapolitan, 1997), and natural resource rents (NRR)
are often used in development studies as an indicator of the amount of revenue generated
by natural resources (less the cost of extracting those resources) that comes from their
sale in the international market (Collier and Hoeffler, 2005). As a result, we test the
hypotheses that NRR (as a percentage of gross domestic product) and homicide rates are
positively correlated between and within countries.1
The present study begins by exploring the theoretical justification for the NRR­
homicide hypotheses. Specifically, to derive our hypotheses we rely upon two sets of
literature. First, we explore community-level studies that document the relationship
between extraction-related economic activity and crime. Second, we examine cross-
national level research by drawing upon the `the natural resource curse' lens that stipu-
lates countries with high NRR face more development-related problems than countries
with low NRR. Within that natural resource curse literature we pay particular attention to
the idea that high NRR countries may potentially harm the economy and encourage civil
violence. We employ a multilevel growth model to test the correlation between NRR and
homicide for 173 countries for the years 2000 to 2012. We then conclude by reflecting
upon our findings in the context of the environmental justice literature and the potential
for future research.
Exploring the potential effect of resource extraction on crime cross-nationally is
important for two reasons. First, policy-makers across the globe regularly make deci-
sions about the pace and extent of resource extraction to generate NRR. Information
about the potential homicide­NRR association might be useful to policy-makers and
affect the kinds of economic policies they select. Second, if a relationship between NRR
and homicide exists, then criminal justice agencies faced with implementing enforce-
ment practices may consider how to use NRR information to better advocate for and
distribute resources to combat crime (Archbold, 2015).
Background
Extractive activities consist of the removal of raw materials from nature (for example, coal,
oil, gas, timber and minerals). These extraction efforts are often promoted by companies
Stretesky et al. 395
and governments, and are designed to stimulate revenue for economic development pur-
poses. Local and national governments that are dependent on high NRR may suffer adverse
social and economic consequences. For instance, Adger (2000: 361) suggests that too
much reliance on NRR increases vulnerability to external shocks such as the volatility of
raw material commodity prices. Jacquet (2014: 8321) describes four general types of prob-
lem that occur from an over-reliance on NRR: `(1) rapid industrialization and loss of gov-
ernance,(2)unevendistributionofcostsandbenefits,(3)conflict,and(4)social-psychological
stress and disruption.' These potential adverse outcomes have led a variety of sociologists
and development scholars to investigate the relationship between high NRR economies
and wellbeing in the case of timber (Fisher, 2001; Wunder, 2001), oil (Obi, 2010), coal
(Perdue and Pavela, 2012) and mineral mining (Pegg, 2006). Together these wellbeing
studies suggest that a variety of social problems, including homicide, are likely to occur
when governments and policy-makers pursue high NRR to boost economic growth.
Community studies
Carrington, Hogg and McIntosh (2011: 353) propose that communities that rely on high
levels of NRR experience greater levels of violence. That is, extractive economies dis-
rupt social life in such a way that crime is more likely to occur. As a result, NRR can
threaten community norms and values and therefore break informal ties and harm com-
munity services (Carrington et al., 2011; see also England and Albrecht, 1984;
Freudenburg and Jones, 1991; Hunter et al., 2002; Wilkinson, 1991). However, it is not
just a matter of elevated NRR promoting crimes such as homicide. It is also a matter of
rapid social change that may occur in areas of high NRR. For instance, as Durkheim sug-
gested in the 19th century with his concept of anomie, rapid social change disrupts com-
munity organization and attenuates social bonds, creating a sense of normlessness in the
community that often leads to increases in crime (Durkheim, 2014 [1902]; see also
Messner, 1989, for an empirical application to homicide rates).
The idea of social disorganization is often used to describe the condition faced by
communities that undergo a rapid transition to an NRR-based economy (Ruddell et al.,
2014). The increase in urbanization, industrialization and immigration that occurs along
with rapid expansion of NRR may break social bonds and threaten conventional com-
munity beliefs and values. This disorganization can then lead to an increase in crime and
delinquency (Kubrin and Weitzer, 2003; Shaw and McKay, 1942). Jacquet (2014: 8321)
makes the connection between natural resource extraction and crime, drawing directly
on concepts used in the social disorganization literature, suggesting that the loss of close-
knit social ties can result in a loss of institutions (church groups, neighbourhood associa-
tions, etc.) that historically provide informal control over social problems including
crime, drug abuse and mental illness, instead requiring formal organizations such as the
police and court system to address these problems. Ruddell et al. (2014) propose that
social disorganization may increase during a natural resource boom, and that is what
leads to observed increases in crime. Anecdotal observations appear to confirm Ruddell
et al.'s (2014: 4) supposition, as reports by some law enforcement officials and residents
of high extraction communities suggest that a `violent element'is attracted to the employ-
ment opportunities brought on by rapid resource extraction that promotes social
396 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
disorganization. As a result of these changes, communities that quickly become reliant
on NRR are sometimes called `energy boom towns'.
Energy boom towns may also face rapid population growth, industrialization and fly-
in, fly-out (FIFO) patterns of predominately male workers (Ruddell et al., 2014). This
pattern of community development disrupts the normal patterns of life in the mostly rural
areas where extraction takes place. The new residents and FIFO workers often cause
problems for long-time residents, such as unemployment, increases in social-psycholog-
ical stress and substance abuse (Jacquet, 2014). The transient nature of the workforce
that migrates into quickly developing NRR economies may even create stress for local
services because those employed in the industry often work shifts around the clock, dis-
rupting families where increases in violent crimes such as domestic abuse have been
reported (Carrington et al., 2011).
As noted, the rapid growth of extraction revenue may attract people seeking various
types of work that `disrupt normal patterns of interaction' (Ruddell et al., 2014: 3). Not
surprisingly, changes in community values also affects the way that law enforcement
responds to crime, reducing community service functions and increasing law enforce-
ment functions. That is, police become more focused on catching and arresting criminals
while reluctantly allowing minor disorder to flourish (Archbold, 2015).
Several empirical studies draw upon the social disorganization thesis to test the rela-
tionship between NRR and crime. As previously noted, these studies generally indicate
that high-NRR economies also tend to have elevated levels of crime (for example,
Archbold et al., 2014; Ruddell et al., 2014). For instance, recent research by Price et al.
(2014) uncovers a relationship between the number of gas extraction wells (which pre-
sumably correlate to higher levels of NRR) and crime across local communities. The
relationship between NRR and crime at the community level of analysis has also been
observed within other developed countries such as Australia and Canada (Carrington
et al., 2011; Ruddell, 2011).
A few studies propose that there is no correlation between NRR and crime (Wilkinson
et al., 1982). Ruddell et al. (2014), for instance, found that although increases in NRR
activity were followed by increases in index crime, high-NRR communities had similar
index crime rates to low-NRR communities. Thus, Ruddell et al.'s results indicate that,
in the case of homicide rates, it is the change in NRR and not the absolute level of NRR
that matters. In addition, Hunter, Krannich and Smith (2002) point out that, although
communities that pursue high levels of NRR as an economic strategy could eventually
recover from elevated levels of NRR-related crime, perceptions of crime would be most
intense for those socially disadvantaged residents living in high-NRR communities.
In sum, previous community-level research highlights how elevated and increasing
NRR can foster disorganization. In turn, disorganization weakens community social
bonds and creates individual and community-level stress that produces the right condi-
tions for crime, including violence and homicide.
Cross-national studies
Whereas problems associated with natural resource extraction are largely studied at the
community level, the focus of this research is cross-national. As community scholars
Stretesky et al. 397
note, however, the same social processes that disrupt and disorganize communities may
also be at work within and across countries. When studying extraction in communities,
Freudenburg (1992: 307) proposed that `newly industrializing nations [may also suffer
from natural resource addiction because] extractive activities are seen as having the
potential to open up entire regions to economic development'.
Cross-national literature on the problems associated with NRR as a form of develop-
ment can be broadly broken down into those studies that focus on economic growth and
those that focus on civil unrest and violence. In 1990,Auty suggested that some countries
experience the `curse of natural resources'.2 Like community-level research, the natural
resource curse hypothesis proposes that development problems are likely to arise in
economies that rely heavily on NRR.3 Shortly afterAuty developed this thesis, Sachs and
Warner used empirical data to study the effects of the resource curse, noting specifically
that a `surprising [feature] of modern economic growth is that economies with abundant
natural resources grow less rapidly than natural-resource-scarce economies' (1995: 1).
Their research demonstrates that developing countries with high levels of natural
resource exports (for example oil, minerals and agriculture), expressed as a percentage
of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1970, tended to experience slower economic growth
over the next decade (see also Sachs and Warner 1997, 1999). Importantly, Sachs and
Warner (1995, 1997) show that only 2 countries rich in natural resources (Malaysia and
Mauritius) out of 19 did not experience a decline in GDP during the 1970s. The primary
reasons that Sachs and Warner (2001) give for this general undesirable relationship is
that countries rich in natural resources may be harming GDP by disrupting more tradi-
tional manufacturing growth. In other words, increases in natural resource extraction
may quickly elevate wages and product prices within countries, making it harder for
manufacturing to compete with other exports in the global marketplace. Sachs and
Warner (2001: 833) note that, `[w]hatever the cause [for lower GDP], it is clear that we
have not seen strong export-led growth in resource abundant economies'.
The implications of these economic problems have also led scholars to think about the
relationship between NRR and homicide. Specifically, comparative researchers believe
that NRR may produce a variety of social problems, including violence (Collier and
Hoeffler, 2002). This more recent strand of research is similar to what is being proposed
by community-level scholars ­ that the resource curse may create conflict and violence
(Collier and Hoeffler, 2005; De Soysa and Neumayer, 2007; Ross, 2003; Skaperdas,
2002). Violence related to natural resources that occurs globally has garnered significant
attention in the press, especially when related to conflicts over resources such as oil and
minerals. In the popular press these conflicts are sometimes framed to highlight the vio-
lence behind their production and extraction (Eligon, 2011). For example, `blood dia-
monds' or `conflict timber' illustrate the social harm associated with the extraction of
certain forms of natural resources (Mullins and Rothe 2008; Orogun, 2004; Van Solinge
2008). Lujala, Gleditsch and Gilmore (2005) also found `a diamonds curse', indicating
that, in the case of secondary diamonds, there was an increase in the likelihood of ethnic
fighting.4 For example, murders and missing persons in Colombia are all too often asso-
ciated with the capture of productive lands for the purpose of extracting palm oil (Borras
and Franco, 2010a, 2010b). As a result, conflict over land associated with valuable natu-
ral resources may quickly lead to elevated murder rates (Myers, 1997). Moreover, as
398 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
Downey, Bonds and Clark (2010) suggest, there are many different forms of extraction
(for example mining and timber) that may encourage violence and murder in some
countries.
There are some additional reasons that NRR may generate violence at a cross-national
level. First, some researchers describe violence as a function of `looting rebels' (Mildner
et al., 2011). That is, in nation-states with weak governments, rebels can forcibly and
violently take NRR as a method of funding political conflict. Collier and Hoeffler (2002:
625) conclude that NRR generate `low opportunity costs for rebellion and make civil war
more likely'. Moreover, NRR reliance may challenge weak governments because law
enforcement is strained and cannot provide protection in areas that can potentially gener-
ate high amounts of resource revenue. Thus, as Ross (2003: 25) contends, `this opens the
door for criminal gangs, warlords, and rogue military officers'.
To date, there is only one academic study that examines the association between NRR
and homicide rates at the cross-national level (Collier and Hoeffler, 2004). Specifically,
Collier and Hoeffler (2004) studied deliberate killings and civil war deaths as a function
of NRR.5 Collier and Hoeffler (2004) hypothesize that civil war deaths and homicides
are likely to share predictors (that is, independent variables). The researchers conduct a
cross-sectional analysis that illustrates important differences between the dependent
variables. Specifically, they find that both ethnic dominance and NRR are positively cor-
related with the risk of civil war and that neither variable is correlated with homicide.
Nevertheless, Collier and Hoeffler (2004) conclude that this finding requires further
empirical investigation.
In sum, the literature on the impact of natural resource extraction and the resultant
rents suggests the following two hypotheses, which we test in this article.
Hypothesis 1: Annual increases in a country's natural resource rents are associated with annual
increases in the country's homicide rents (that is, the within-country hypothesis).
Hypothesis 2: Countries with higher average natural resource rents will have higher homicide
rates compared with countries with lower natural resource rents (that is, the between-country
hypothesis).
Methods
We examine the cross-national correlation between NRR and homicide rates using mul-
tilevel models for change. This procedure models one dependent variable and multiple
independent variables (Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, 2008; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002).
Multilevel change models are particularly appropriate for examining the relationship
between NRR and homicide because they allow for the simultaneous estimations of
year-to-year changes within individual countries (level 1) as well as between countries
(level 2). Thus, we can assess the important question of whether NRR appear to facilitate
homicide over time (within country), across space (between countries), or both. As per
convention, we control for year in all of the statistical models.
We gathered data on natural resource extraction and other competing explanations of
homicide for the years 2000 to 2012 for the 173 countries for which homicide and natural

resource data were available over time (listed in Appendix 1). All of the variables used in
our regression models of homicide are described below, with descriptive statistics for the
overall sample presented in Appendix 2 and the between- and within-country variances
listed in Appendix 3. We now turn to the description of the variables used in our
models.
Dependent variable
Our dependent variable is the homicide rate, measured as homicides per 100,000 per-
sons. We focus our analysis on homicide rates because community and cross-national
studies suggest that violence may be related to NRR and because homicide data are
widely acknowledged to be the most valid and reliable cross-national indicator of vio-
lence (Neapolitan, 1997). As a result, it is possible to examine the variability in the homi-
cide rate per country and per year (2000 to 2012).
The total number of homicides per country, per year was extracted from the Global
Study on Homicide 2013 (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014), which
compiles world homicide statistics over time. Data in this report are derived from crimi-
nal justice or public health systems and are verified through validity checks (see United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014: 110­11). These data intend to measure all
recorded `unlawful deaths purposefully inflicted on a person by another person' (United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014: 109). Because the distribution of homicide
data is substantially non-normal across countries over time (skewness = 2.5, kurtosis =
7.7), we take the natural log of the variable to produce a better-fitting regression line and
400 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
more normally distributed regression residuals. As noted in Figure 1, the distribution of
the transformed homicide rate variable is relatively normal ­ even if slightly bimodal
(skewness = 0.20, kurtosis = -0.79).
The natural log of homicide improves model fit substantially and reduced the stand-
ard error estimates at both level 1 and level 2, allowing for a better test of the natural
resource curse­homicide hypothesis between and within countries.
Natural resource extraction
We are interested in determining whether NRR is correlated with homicide rates between
and/or within countries. Thus, we collected data on NRR for each country over time as a
way to estimate the extent of extraction activity in a country as well as to measure how
much a particular country relies on revenue generated from the sale of natural resources.
NRR are one common measure of extraction relative to revenue. NRR data represent the
surplus value or economic profits as a percentage of GDP that results from the sale of
non-renewable natural resources (oil, gas, coal, minerals and timber). NRR, as a portion
of GDP, are also often used as a measure of natural resource wealth in the natural resource
curse literature (Collier and Hoeffler, 2005).As previously noted, as NRR increase, hom-
icide should also increase because this form of economic development harms social life
and leads to disruption and disorganization in communities and countries. Moreover,
high NRR may promote political conflict between some countries at the national level.
The NRR data are also highly skewed and peaked (skewness = 2.41, kurtosis = 4.36)
because some countries rely heavily on NRR and others virtually not at all. As a result,
we take the natural log of NRR because it helps to correct for the non-linear relationships
that emerge between NRR and homicide (skewness = 0.71, kurtosis = 1.78). NRR data
are available from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org; see also Hamilton and
Clemens, 1998, for further discussion of NRR).
Control variables
Several variables that might have an impact on the relationship between NRR and homi-
cide must be controlled in the statistical analysis of NRR and homicides. Based on prior
studies, GDP is one major variable that needs to be controlled in the analysis of homicide
rates. GDP per capita across countries over time is collected from the World Bank and
measured in thousands of US dollars per person. It is the market value of production,
services and sales. The relationship between GDP and homicide is mixed in the litera-
ture, which finds positive, negative and no relationship between the variables (Pridemore
and Trent, 2010). We also control for income inequality using the Gini index. The Gini
index is obtained from the World Bank dataset and is frequently used as a measure of
income inequality in social science research (http://data.worldbank.org). Gini is noted to
be positively correlated with homicide rates in cross-national studies (Barber, 2006;
Bjerregaard and Cochran, 2008; Nivette, 2011).
We control for three additional economic variables that were also collected from the
World Bank. First, we control for the percentage of unemployed in each country each
year since this variable has also been linked with homicide rates (Huang, 2001). That is,
Stretesky et al. 401
as unemployment increases across countries, so does homicide. Second, infant mortality
is controlled when testing the relationship between NRR and homicide. Infant mortality
measures the number of infants who die before the age of 1 per 1000 live births. Infant
mortality is an indicator of poverty that should be positively associated with homicide
rates between and within countries. Finally, foreign direct investment (FDI) is controlled
and is an indicator of the direct investment of equity capital and the reinvestment of earn-
ings into the economy as a proportion of GDP. Direct investment is typically not exam-
ined in homicide studies, but could drive NRR that impact on homicide rates. As a result,
we examine the relationship between direct investments before NRR are included in the
analysis to see if it is a potential mechanism that helps specify the relationship between
NRR and homicide.
In addition to economic controls, we include five population indicators, one indicator
of governance and one regional indicator. The percentage of the population in each coun-
try residing in an urban area is obtained from the World Bank and controlled in the analy-
sis because increased urbanization has been linked to elevated homicide rates in some
cross-national studies (Fischer, 1975). It is also an indicator of social disorganization
because it has been argued that increases in urbanization are related to increases in crime.
Population, measured in billions of residents, is also controlled in the analysis and allows
us to assess if more populated countries or countries that grow in population also experi-
ence higher homicide rates. To account for age structure and gender we include the per-
centage of the population aged 0­14 years, the percentage of the population aged 15­64
years and the percentage of the population that is female.6 Democracy is examined as a
control variable and is measured using the report Freedom in the World, produced by
Freedom House (https://freedomhouse.org/report-types/freedom-world). The database
documents each country's political freedom in a `freedom index' over time, using a rat-
ing that ranges from `1' (most free) to `7' (least free). We reverse-coded the democracy
variable so higher values represent countries that have higher political freedom. We also
include a measure of corruption, the Corruption Perception Index (CPI; Transparency
International, 2016). The CPI is measured on a scale ranging from 0 (highly corrupt) to
10 (very clean). We reverse-coded CPI so higher values represent higher levels of cor-
ruption. Finally, the region of the world in which a country is located is included only in
the between effects portion of the analysis, divided into the seven categories available in
the World Bank data (Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia Pacific, Europe Central Asia, Latin
America Caribbean, Middle East North and North Africa, North America and South
America). This variable is entered into the analysis as a dummy variable and the refer-
ence category is Sub-Saharan Africa (see Appendix 2).
Analysis
To test the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between NRR and homicide
rates we use data for the 173 countries listed in Appendix 1 for the years 2000­12. Table
1 presents multilevel growth model estimates that test the viability of the notion that
NRR and homicide are related.As noted, level-1 variables allow us to estimate the values
of each variable at a specific year, and the level-2 variables average the values of the
variable (that is, a grand mean centred) for each country from 2000 to 2012. In Table 1
402 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
we estimate three multilevel growth models for homicide rates. The first model (Model
1) examines the relationship between a five-year lag of NRR and homicide controlling

only for region and year. We estimate the five-year lag of rents for theoretical and empiri-
cal reasons. That is, we rely on the natural resource curse literature, which notes that the
impact of any resource curse is delayed rather than immediate (Ross, 2003). Also impor-
tant, as noted below, is that the five-year lag produces the best-fitting model of NRR and
homicide. We return to the issue of lagging NRR below, however, suggesting that, if
social disruption and disorganization intensify over time, the lag in NRR produces the
strongest correlation and is theoretically justified. Model 2 displays results for the impact
of the control variables on homicide. Model 3 combines Model 1 and Model 2 variables
to show the impact of NRR on homicide while controlling for typical variables used in
cross-national analysis.
Missing data
As noted earlier, cross-national homicide data are the most available and reliable cross-
national crime indicator. However, it still suffers from missing data, particularly when
employing longitudinal analysis (Neapolitan, 1997). In order to add validity to our find-
ings we examined the distribution of missing data in the dataset for patterns and then
employed several modelling strategies.
The frequency of missing cases for each variable is reported in Appendix 4. It is clear
that homicide rates have a substantial number of missing values (n = 915). This is poten-
tially problematic, but it is the reality of modelling cross-national homicide rates longi-
tudinally. Several independent variables (that is Gini, percent unemployed, democracy
and corruption) also have a number of missing values. The Gini index has a very large
percentage of missing values (72.48 percent), suggesting that perhaps it should be elimi-
nated from the models. We did not include it in the level-1 portion of the models for this
reason; however, because the level-2 models are averaged between effects, we were able
to keep it in level 2. Recall, level-2 coefficients are the average effects of the variable
over the time period under study, 2000­12. Since every country in the model had a least
one value of the Gini index during that time period, there are no missing values of Gini
at level 2. We next employed the Stata 13.1 command ­ misstable pattern ­ to the data-
set, which produces an analysis of all the different permutations of missing values. The
three most common patterns of missing data in the dataset are, (1) values of all variables
except missing Gini (n = 504), (2) values of all variables except missing Gini and homi-
cide (n = 388) and (3) values of all variables except missing Gini, homicide and corrup-
tion (n = 117). All other permutations of missing data patterns had fewer than 100 cases.
As noted, missing Gini values do not affect the results because it is not included in
level-1 results, and missing homicide values are a common limitation to cross-national
homicide studies (Neapolitan, 1997). However, the majority of existing cross-national
studies are cross-sectional; in our longitudinal study the missing values have less of an
impact on the results because we are modelling change. For example, if a country is
missing a value for the corruption indicator for 2001, the multilevel change model will
ignore the missing value and model the corruption change for that country between 2000
and 2002. Additionally, there are not missing values at level 2 for any of the variables
because they are average values for 2000­12.
404 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
To further validate our results we modelled the data in three ways. First, we used
listwise deletion and removed any country from the analysis that had a missing value on
any variable. We next restricted the results to cases that had no missing values of NRR.
Finally, we used the mi suite of commands in Stata to impute all missing values of all the
independent variables in the analysis. The findings for the NRR variable were very simi-
lar in each method of analysis, resulting in the coefficients having the same level of sta-
tistical significance in each approach. We report the models from the first approach
(listwise deletion) here.
Results
Model 1 (Table 1) suggests that NRR are related to homicide, but only within countries
(level 1) and not between them (level 2). That is, within countries the correlation between
the natural log of NRR and the natural log of the homicide rate is .076 (p < .001; two-
tailed). More specifically, a one unit annual change in the log of NRR is associated with
a .076 unit annual change in the log of the homicide rate. As a result, Model 1 (level 1)
suggests that, when examining the bivariate association between NRR and homicide
rates, the two variables are positively correlated within (and not between) countries.
Model 2 ­ the control variable model ­ finds that several predictors are significantly
related to NRR. Increases in the percentage of the population residing in urban areas are
associated with increases in homicide rates (level 1). Governments that become more
corrupt within countries experience associated increases in homicide rates (level 1).
Increases in the percentage of the population aged 15­64 years are associated with
increases in homicide rates (level 1). Income inequality is also positively correlated with
homicide rates across countries (level 2) and implies that countries with high levels of
income inequality also tend to have higher homicide rates. Percentage unemployed, per-
centage 0­14 years and percentage female are all positively correlated with homicide
rates between countries (level 2). Interestingly, GDP per capita is not significantly related
to homicide rates either within or between countries. This is not surprising because
cross-national studies of homicide have found negative, positive and no significant rela-
tionship between GDP per capita and homicide rates (Pridemore and Trent, 2010), indi-
cating that this relationship is empirically unclear.
Level-2 (Model 2) results for infant mortality and percentage urban are unusual.
Infant mortality, an indicator of poverty, is negatively related to homicide rates in Model
2 (level 2), a strange finding given that poverty should be related to homicide rates across
countries (Pridemore, 2008). Model 2 also suggests an odd finding for percentage urban.
Specifically, countries with higher percentages of population residing in urban areas
have lower homicide rates compared with countries with smaller urban populations. The
remaining control variables (FDI, democracy and region) do not appear to be correlated
with homicide rates.
Importantly, Model 3 (Table 1) provides support for the position that NRR continue
to be correlated with homicide even after controlling for important factors that may influ-
ence homicide rates across countries. That is, according to Model 3 (level 1) a one unit
annual change in the log of NRR is associated with a 0.040 unit annual change in the log
of the homicide rate. The addition of NRR to Model 2 also helps explain the odd findings
Stretesky et al. 405
for infant mortality and percentage urban (both at level 2). Specifically, infant mortality
and percentage urban become statistically insignificant in Model 3 (level 2) when NRR
are included in the model, suggesting the relationship in Model 2 may have been a result
of model misspecification. In the case of infant mortality, this finding perhaps implies
that NRR may influence both poverty and homicide ­ a result that is consistent with the
natural resource curse literature. That is, the changes in the type of development matter
when it comes to homicide rates. Importantly, then, it appears that, within countries when
relevant predictors of homicide are included in the model, only the type of economic
development (natural resource rents) is related to homicide rates at level 1.
The results for NRR at level 2 (Model 3) are also important. The correlation between
NRR and homicide remains non-existent at level 2 (Model 3), signifying that it is the
change in NRR as opposed to the level of NRR that matters. It is interesting to note that
these results are similar to the Ruddell et al.'s (2014) community-level findings that there
are no differences between local communities that engage in natural resource extraction
and those that do not, but those communities that do engage in extraction observe
increases in crime over time. Thus, local findings appear to be supported at the cross-
national level in Table 1.
The relationship between NRR and homicide requires some additional attention. That
is, if NRR and homicide are correlated, how does that correlation emerge over time? As
previously noted, we lagged NRR to examine the relationship between NRR and homi-
cide. Figure 2 examines that lag in more detail ­ seeking to identify potential patterns in
the relationship between NRR and homicide. An identified pattern in this relationship is
Figure 2. Relationship between natural resource rents (lagged by 0 to 11 years) and homicide
rates.
406 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
important because it indicates whether countries may simply live with an increasing
homicide rate over the short term. That is, if the relationship between NRR and homicide
becomes weak over time, that might suggest that countries that adopt natural resource
related development as a form of economic development simply need to `wait it out'.
Since higher-extraction countries do not appear to have higher homicide rates, as indi-
cated in Table 1, the within-country potential impact of increases in homicide rates may
be short lived. Next, we investigate whether NRR is likely to have a delayed impact, by
examining the correlation between its lag and homicide rates. The lagged analysis helps
to determine if the potential impact of NRR on homicide is short lived (assuming such a
relationship does indeed exist, as Table 1 suggests).
Figure 2 charts the level-1 coefficients for each lag of NRR on homicide in a multi-
level model that controls for region, income inequality and the Gini index. The figure
shows that the relationship between homicide rates and NRR is complex in that it
emerges gradually over time. For example, at level 1 the relationship between that log of
NRR and homicide ­ controlling for GDP, Gini and region ­ is not statistically signifi-
cant until NRR is lagged by three years (coefficient = .04; p < .05). However, the associa-
tion gradually increases so that by year 10 the association between NRR and homicide is
.08 (p < .05). Thus, although it appears that having high levels of NRR is not a problem,
countries that increase their reliance on NRR appear to create a significant problem over
the long run with respect to increasing homicide rates. That is, it appears that the impact
of increases in NRR matter for homicide rates in the future.
Conclusion
Community- and country-level studies suggest that an overreliance on NRR may pro-
duce crime and violence. As an extension of this position we argued that a reliance on
NRR may disrupt and disorganize social life and lead to higher levels of homicide. We
tested the NRR­homicide hypothesis at the country level for the years 2000 to 2012 by
examining the correlation between NRR and homicide rates. Our multilevel findings
suggest that there is a correlation between NRR and homicide rates, but that correlation
exists only with respect to changing reliance on NRR within countries. That is, the rela-
tionship between NRR and homicide does not appear between countries and high-
extraction countries do not, on average, tend to have higher homicide rates. As a result,
the NRR­homicide hypothesis suggests that within-country trends in NRR and homi-
cide are positively correlated over time, whereas the between-country NRR­homicide
hypothesis was rejected. This is an interesting finding because it suggests that rapid
increases in NRR increase homicide, but that overall levels of NRR do not. To illustrate
these different patterns it is helpful to briefly examine two specific countries.
Guatemala's homicide rate increased from 25.9 to 39.9 between 2000 and 2012, and its
NRR increased from 2.4 percent to 4.2 percent over the same time frame. Guatemala's
NRR and homicide rates both almost doubled, demonstrating the within-group cross-
national finding at a national level; that is, rapid increases in NRR are associated with
rapid increases in homicide rates. In contrast, in 2012, Saudi Arabia's NRR was 48.18
percent, indicating that almost half of the entire country's GDP comes from NRR.
However, in the same year, Saudi Arabia's homicide rate was 0.8, one of the lowest of
Stretesky et al. 407
all countries in the dataset. As we found by failing to reject the between-country hypoth-
eses, just because Saudi Arabia has a very high NRR value this does not mean that it
will also have a high homicide rate. The effect of NRR comes when there is a rapid
change in rents, not the overall value of the NRR.
The potential role of NRR in organizing homicide rates has implications for policy-
makers who might be contemplating a shift to heavy reliance on NRR for development.
First, although it is often assumed that natural resource extraction is unsustainable and
leads to economic harm and environmental destruction over the long run, we believe
there is an additional reason for caution. Specifically, although NRR may stimulate
revenue in the short run it can also lead to increases in social problems, such as homi-
cide, over the long run. There is no evidence to suggest that countries with high extrac-
tion rates have high homicide rates, but there is reason to suspect that social change
­ especially related to development ­ may contribute to changes in homicide. In some
respects our findings regarding NRR sum up the essential nature of developmental
change (that is, Durkheim, 2014 [1902]). That is, significant levels of social and eco-
nomic change ­ and not the end result of that change ­ are what produce social prob-
lems such as homicide.
Second, if there is a relationship between NRR and homicide, then social institutions
(for example, law enforcement) are likely to require more state support in countries that
begin to shift their economies toward NRR-based economies (Archbold et al., 2014).
However, extensively extractive economies are often viewed as overtly oppressive and
many have been accused of using direct and forcible control to facilitate extraction. This
situation is likely to raise human rights issues because state power may be directed
toward facilitating state violence to increase NRR rather than reducing social violence to
promote development. Although we do not have the space in this article, future research
should examine whether development centred on NRR also promotes political violence,
rather than the relatively non-political crime of homicide as it is measure in this study.
Nevertheless, it could certainly be argued that the developed countries using extracted
resources should be paying the costs associated with combating the additional homicide
they create. This is even more important because countries that turn to NRR as a form of
development are probably the least likely to adequately support state services that might
serve to reduce violence. This particular situation could be viewed through an environ-
mental justice lens, suggesting that environmental extraction produces harmful outcomes
that are most likely to be imposed on less developed countries. In the end we argue that
the role of natural resource extraction and the NRR­homicide hypothesis needs more
serious consideration in cross-national studies of homicide because it may be counter-
productive to the development process. We hope our findings have generated more inter-
est in such research and recommend two areas for potential future study.
First, NRR are likely to vary by a country's location in the international economy
(Wallerstein, 1974), and underdeveloped as well as some developing nations are more
likely to have economies linked to NRR than are developed nations. Scholars have
argued that the majority of revenue generated from NRR does not help local economies;
rather, because the extraction was funded by FDI, most of the profit leaves the local area
and often the entire country (see Stiglitz, 2002: 67­73). This suggests that future research
needs to examine the effects of foreign capital on social disorganization and homicide.
408 European Journal of Criminology 14(4)
We not only find that countries with higher NRR have slightly higher homicide rates
in general, but also suggest that within highly extractive countries an association between
NRR and homicide is most likely to exist over time. As a result, it is possible that the
effect of NRR on crime may harm some nations and not others, and that further analysis
of this issue is required. Unfortunately, data on homicide are least likely to be collected
in countries that are underdeveloped and have high NRR. We are not the first researchers
to face data problems with respect to missing data among poorer countries with respect
to cross-national homicide rates. Thus, future studies might look to various indicators of
violence that better capture the impact of developmental change on homicide and vio-
lence more generally in less economically developed countries.
Second, our study examines the impact of NRR on homicide over only a relatively
short period of time (13 years). That is, the true social impacts and cumulative nature of
resource-based economies may not be realized for decades after the increases in NRR
occur. Current limitations in cross-national homicide data (and control variables) do not
allow for an expanded look at long-term cross-national homicide trends yet. However, as
data continue to become available this relationship should be monitored. Although there
are considerable calls for alternative energy development and use across the globe, we
anticipate that rates of extraction of coal, oil and gas will continue to increase for some
time because the demand for energy in the global economy has shown few signs of con-
tracting in the near future.

Notes
1. We use the phrase `natural resource rents' (NRR) throughout the article to refer to the amount
of revenue generated from the extraction and sale of natural resources. Other terms sometimes
used for this in the literature include `natural resource wealth', `natural resource income' and
`natural resource revenue'. We use the phrase `natural resource extraction' only when refer-
ring explicitly to the act of extraction.
2. That term was later modified and is now known as `the natural resource curse' (see Frankel,
2010).
3. Gelb (1988) also examined this idea through the study of oil-producing states. Specifically, he
examined how oil revenues in the 1970s helped and harmed developing oil exporters.
4. Although there is considerable support for the relationship between natural resource wealth
and violence, not all researchers find that relationship. For instance, Brunnschweiler and
Bulte (2009) discovered that natural resource riches do not increase violence for the 97 coun-
tries they studied between 1960 and 2004.
5. Collier and Hoeffler (2004: 5) note that, for their variables, `there is little variation over time
[and as a result] there is a loss of efficiency in examining within country differences'. As a
result, they relied on a cross-sectional analysis of homicide rates.
6. Many cross-sectional studies of homicide rates include the percentage of males aged 15­24
in their analyses to account for the fact that this is often seen as a group that commits a high
level of crime. These data are not available for all of the countries in the analysis for all of the
years. Therefore we include the age structure and the percent female variables as proxies.
