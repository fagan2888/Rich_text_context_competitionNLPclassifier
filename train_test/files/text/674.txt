Health Plan Switching:
Choice Or Circumstance?
Data from the Community Tracking Study give a glimpse of who among the
privately insured are likely to switch plans, and why.
by Peter J. Cunningham and Linda Kohn
Changing health plans may be
beneficial to the extent that it results
from consumers' decisions and prefer-
ences about what type of health plan best
suits their health care needs. On the other
hand, consumers today are not only choosing
a plan to finance the use of services, but
within that decision are also choosing a deliv-
ery system or network of providers. There-
fore, changing health plans may lead to a
change in physicians, which may prove harm-
ful to continuity of care, access, and quality.1
The extent to which changes in health
plans are beneficial or potentially harmful de-
pends on the answers to several key ques-
tions: How frequently are changes made, es-
pecially by vulnerable populations who are
already at risk for problems with medical care
access and quality? To what extent is chang-
ing plans voluntary (for example, consumers
exercising choice) or involuntary (for exam-
ple, forced changes by employers)? How often
does changing health plans lead to a change in
the place that persons usually receive medical
care?
Previous studies have been limited to the
experience of a single company, which makes
it difficult to generalize to the privately in-
sured population as a whole.2 Using data from
the 1996­1997 Community Tracking Study
(CTS) household survey, this study is among
the first to examine consumers' switching
among private insurance plans nationwide.
Data And Methods
n Data. The CTS is a major initiative of the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)
to track changes in the health care system
over time and to gain a better understanding
of how health system changes are affecting
people.3 The CTS household survey was de-
signed to produce representative estimates for
the U.S. population as well as for sixty ran-
domly selected communities. The sample was
based on random-digit dialing, as well as on a
small field sample to represent households
without telephones. A family respondent was
selected to report on health insurance cover-
age (among other factors) for other persons in
the family included in the survey (all adults
and one randomly selected child).4 The overall
response rate for the household survey was 65
percent for families.
The sample includes 32,732 families and
60,446 individuals. The sample for this analy-
sis includes 37,545 nonelderly persons who
were privately insured throughout the survey
year (1996­1997).5
n Determining plan switching. We in-
clude both employer-sponsored private insur-
ance and private insurance plans that are pur-
chased directly by the enrollee. For persons
covered by private insurance on the day of the
interview, a change of health plans was con-
sidered to have occurred if they first enrolled
in their current plan during the prior twelve
months and if their previous plan was also

private insurance (asked in the survey). Per-
sons continuously covered by the same pri-
vate insurance plan throughout the twelve
months prior to the interview were consid-
ered to have not changed plans. Respondents
also were asked whether their current and
previous plans were health maintenance or-
ganization (HMO) or non-HMO plans.
Health Plan Switching:
A National Profile
n How many people change health plans?
About 17 percent of privately insured persons
changed their health plan during the year
prior to the survey. About two-thirds of per-
sons who changed plans stayed in the same
plan type (Exhibit 1), while about one-fourth
switched from a non-HMO to an HMO, and
10.5 percent of changers switched from an
HMO to a non-HMO.
n Why do people change plans? Most
changes were made for reasons other than
consumer preference. About one-third cited a
change in employment, while 36.3 percent
cited a change in employer plan offerings. Just
under one-fourth changed plans because of
some desired attribute of their current plan,
including 16 percent who changed because
the current plan is less expensive and about 8
percent, because their current plan has better
services, higher quality, preferred doctors, or
more convenient locations. About 4 percent
changed plans because of a change in their
eligibility (not shown), usually a change in
marital status or eligibility for a parent's plan.
About another 4 percent changed plans for
other miscellaneous reasons, or the reason
was not ascertained (not shown).
Persons switching to an HMO were more
likely than other types of plan changers were
to cite lower cost as the reason for changing
plans. Despite the so-called consumer back-
lash against managed care plans in recent
years, persons disenrolling from HMOs were
only slightly more likely than persons switch-
ing to HMOs to cite "better services" as the
reason for change, although the difference was
not statistically significant. If disgruntlement
with HMOs is a major reason for switching to
non-HMOs, then it would have to be related
to a change in employment. Persons disen-
rolling from HMOs were more likely than
other plan changers were to cite a change in
employment as the reason for their change,
while significantly fewer persons switching
to an HMO did so as a result of a job change.
This also suggests that it is much more dif-
ficult to draw the line between what repre-
sents a "voluntary" versus an "involuntary"
change of plans. While termination of em-
ployment could result in an involuntary

change in plans, the scope and generosity of
health benefits also may play a role in the
decision to leave a job or accept a different job.
In addition, employers may change their offer-
ings as a cost-effective way to make their total
compensation package more attractive to
both current and prospective employees.
On the other hand, "voluntary changes" in
plans usually take place within a choice set
that is constrained by both what an employer
offers and what the individual can afford.
Only about half of workers whose employer
offers coverage have a choice of more than one
plan.6 Even when workers have a choice, these
may be restricted in number, type, and cost.
n Who is most likely to change plans?
To the extent that one views changes in
health plans as a potential "problem" (that is,
leading to disruptions in care), there may be
particular concern about plan changes for cer-
tain "vulnerable" populations who either have
high health care needs or already are more
likely to experience problems with medical
care access and quality. However, as shown in
Exhibit 2, near-elderly persons (ages fifty-five
to sixty-four), blacks, Hispanics, and persons
in fair or poor health were less likely than
others were to change health plans.7 In addi-
tion, changes of health plans were no more
frequent among persons with lower incomes
or less education.
When they do change plans, blacks and
persons in fair or poor health who start out in
non-HMOs are more likely to switch to an
HMO. Blacks who decide to change plans
may have either more constrained choices or
greater preferences for HMOs, which usually
entail lower costs. Stronger preferences for
HMOs among blacks would be consistent
with a previous study that found that blacks
expressed greater willingness than whites did
to give up some choice in health care to save
on costs.8
Persons with more-serious health prob-
lems also may prefer HMOs when they switch
plans to save on out-of-pocket costs (espe-
cially since their health care use and costs
tend to be much higher than average). The
findings also suggest that favorable selection
practices among HMOs--to the extent that
they exist--are not so rampant as to prevent
persons with high health care needs in general
from switching to HMOs. On the other hand,
the greater use of services among those in fair
or poor health also means that switching to an
HMO may entail a greater risk if it means a
disruption in their care arrangements and the
providers they normally see.
n Does greater choice lead to more
plan switching? Although one might expect
that having a choice of plans through an em-
ployer would lead to more plan switching,
persons offered only a single plan change as
often as do those with some choice (presum-
ably because of an employer action).9
However, when people do change health
plans, having a choice is associated with a
higher likelihood of switching to an HMO.
This likelihood is as high for those who are
offered a choice of HMO and non-HMO plans
as it is for those offered any choice (findings
not shown). This suggests that the growth of
managed care plans is not solely the result of
employers' "forcing" their workers into HMO
plans by offering only HMOs, but also by em-
ployees seeking to save onout-of-pocket costs
by enrolling in lower-cost HMOs.
But while choice of plans through employ-
ers may lead to more switching to HMO
plans, persons choosing from plans in the
nongroup market are more likely to disenroll
from HMOs and less likely to switch to
HMOs than are persons who obtain their in-
surance through employers. It is not clear
why. However, any financial incentives that
employers offer their employees to enroll and
stay in an HMO would not be available to
those in the nongroup market. Also, fewer
HMOs offer nongroup policies, and if HMOs
in the nongroup market are less stable or of
lower quality than those in the group market,
negative experiences with these plans could
lead to more disenrollment.10
n Is plan switching more common in
areas dominated by managed care? The
growth of managed care in a particular area is
often accompanied by increased turmoil and
competition in the health insurance mar-

ket--attributable in part to more-aggressive
price shopping for health insurance by em-
ployers--which results in some plans merg-
ing, others leaving the market entirely, or new
plans entering the market. One would expect
that the main impact of this activity on con-
sumers would be an increased frequency of
health plan changes. However, we found that
the rate of plan changing is only slightly
higher in areas with moderate or high HMO
and point-of-service (POS) plan penetration
compared with areas with low penetration.11
Thus, to the extent that heavy managed care
activity is associated with greater turmoil in
the health insurance market (which we can-
not measure directly), the impact on consum-
ers appears to be fairly small.
As one would expect, persons in areas with
high HMO/POS penetration who change
plans are more likely than are persons in areas
with low penetration to switch to HMO
plans, while low-penetration areas experi-
ence higher rates of disenrollment from
HMOs. The comparable rates of switching to
HMO and non-HMO plans in low-penetra-
tion markets (34.8 percent and 33.6 percent,
respectively) suggests that overall HMO/POS
penetration in these markets is not increasing.
However, the higher rate of switching to
HMO plans (compared with non-HMO
switching) in areas with moderate penetra-
tion (20­40 percent) suggests that these areas
will eventually change to high-penetration ar-
eas. The much higher rate of switching to
HMO plans in high-penetration areas sug-
gests that HMOs will become even more
dominant in these areas.
n How often does plan changing result
in a change in providers? Persons who
changed health plans were twice as likely as
persons who did not change plans were to
change the place where they usually receive
medical care (Exhibit 3). In addition, a change
in the usual source of care was found to be
higher for persons switching between HMO
plans--or into or out of an HMO--compared
with persons who were switching between
non-HMO plans. This is consistent with the
fact that non-HMO plans include traditional
indemnity plans--which typically do not use
defined provider networks--as well as pre-
ferred provider organizations (PPOs) whose
provider networks tend to be larger and less
exclusive than those of HMOs.
For these same reasons, however, it is
somewhat surprising that the rate of changing
providers is still relatively low (less than 30
percent), even when the plan change involves
an HMO. That most plan changers maintain
their usual source of care suggests consider-

able overlap between provider networks,
which is more common in the network or in-
dependent practice association (IPA) model
of HMO. Alternatively, some may exercise
plan options to pay higher copayments for go-
ing outside the network (as with PPOs and
POS plans) or pay the full costs of medical
visits to keep seeing a physician with whom
they have a long-standing relationship.
Moreover, even among those who changed
both their health plans and their usual source
of care in the same year, only about half ex-
plicitly cited changes in their insurance as the
reason for changing their usual source of care
(Exhibit 4). The rest cited quality, the avail-
ability of their previous usual source of care,
or other reasons. While changes in insurance
may be indirectly related to some of these
other reasons, these findings suggest that
even fewer provider changes are directly asso-
ciated with a change in health plans.
It is important to note that these results do
not allow us to determine whether or not the
change in insurance actually caused the
change in usual source of care (that is,
whether the plan change occurred before or
after the change in providers). With the al-
most universal use of provider networks by
managed care plans, it also is possible that
some consumers change plans to gain access
to a provider in a different network.
Discussion
Two contradictory perspectives on the merits
of plan changing have emerged. The "con-
sumer choice" perspective holds that a change
may allow consumers to obtain a plan that
best suits their needs, and the resulting com-
petition among health plans leads to both
lower costs and higher quality. The key as-
sumption behind this view is that health plan
switching reflects consumers' choice.
Another perspective stresses that health
plan switching can lead to a change in physi-
cians, thus disrupting the patient/provider re-
lationship and continuity of care. A key as-
sumption behind this view is that consumers'
actual choices are limited, and hence most
plan changes are involuntary.
The results from this study suggest that
consumer choice is directly involved in only
about one-fourth of plan changes and that
most changing is the result of a job change or
a change in employers' plan offerings. On the
other hand, consumer choice appears to play a
somewhat larger role in switching to HMOs.
While this may in part reflect the fact that
some consumers cannot afford other options,
we did not find a significantly higher rate of
switching to HMO plans among low-income
persons. Rather than strictly being an issue of
affordability, a desire for lower health care
costs is something that consumers value, and
most have expressed a willingness to accept
some restrictions on their care to save on
costs.12
Although we could not examine how plan
changes directly affected health care access,
use, or perceived quality, it appears that major
disruptions in care through a change in
providers does not occur as often as one might
expect, although some plan changers might
incur higher out-of-pocket costs in order to
keep seeing the same physician. In fact, when
we consider all persons who had private in-
surance throughout the survey year, no more

than about 2 percent were forced to change
providers as a result of some change in their
insurance.13
Furthermore, it is likely that forced
changes in providers resulting from plan
changes will decrease even further, given the
fact that various "patients' bills of rights" are
designed to increase access to physicians and
that many managed care plans on their own
have been moving toward more open provider
networks since the time of the survey. On the
other hand, a return to high annual increases
in health insurance premiums may lead to
even greater demand among employers and
consumers for lower-cost plans, thereby in-
creasing the rate of plan switching.
Future rounds of the CTS will allow for an
examination of changes in the rate of plan
switching among privately insured persons,
to provide further insight into how changing
health plans affects people's experiences with
the health care system.
