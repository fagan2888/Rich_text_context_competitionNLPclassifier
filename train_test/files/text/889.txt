Social Relations and Health Assessments
Among Older People: Do the Effects of Integration
and Social Contributions Vary Cross-Culturally?

Research on health assessments has shown the importance of social relations as afactor influencing health, especially
among older people. Drawing upon sociological theories of social integration and social exchange, this research
examines two domains of social relations which are expected to influence assessed health. In addition, the study uses a
cross-national sample (N = 3,407) of noninstitutionalized older people from the Republic of Korea, Fiji, Malaysia,
and the Philippines to determine if modernization conditions the relationships between social relations and health.
Results indicate that social integration has a positive effect on subjective health assessments in all nations, whereas
social contributions are significant only in Korea. Findings suggest that health assessments by elders in the most
modernized nations appear to be much more influenced by the contributions they make to the social order than is the
case in nations which are less modernized.
HEALTH has long been interpreted as a state of complete
physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely
the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organiza-
tion, 1958). In order to capture this overall state of health
reflecting morbidity, function, and well-being, researchers
have often turned to self-assessments of health as one of the
most parsimonious and reliable indicators available (Engle
and Graney, 1986; Idler, 1993; Idler and Kasl, 1991).
Despite the limitations inherent in a single item to measure a
complex concept, it remains one of the most valuable indica-
tors of health and predictors of health service use and
mortality (e.g., Idler and Angel, 1990; Rakowski, Mor, and
Hiris, 1991; Wolinsky and Johnson, 1992). Indeed, Lange
(1986) proposed that subjective evaluation of health is a
combination of both illness and role performance reflecting
the dominant concepts in the medical and social functioning
models of health and illness.
While self-assessed health continues to be widely used
and command the attention of researchers, relatively little
attention has been given to how social context and social
relations may affect health assessments. There is a substan-
tial literature on the subject of social relations as protective
of health, the majority of which emphasizes the finding that
social support leads to better health (Berkman, 1984; Gott-
lieb, 1981; Goudy and Goudeau, 1981; Kaplan etal., 1977;
Stevens, 1992). Nevertheless, some empirical evidence has
shown that social support may also bring negative effects to
health because of ineffective "help," excessive help, and
unwanted or unpleasant interactions (Krause, 1995; Rook
and Pietromonaco, 1987).
Research on how social relations may influence health
assessments, beyond the effects due to morbidity and func-
tion, suggests that people who are dissatisfied with their
social relations actually rate their health poorer (Auslander
andLitwin, 1991; Krause, 1987). In addition, Stoller( 1984)
found that extensive informal assistance may have the unin-
tended effect of making health ratings more negative, pre-
sumably because of the dependency in the relationship. The
evidence is increasingly clear that social relations influence
health assessments, but the mechanisms of the influence are
still unclear. This study seeks to contribute to our under-
standing of social relations and health assessments among
older people in two ways. First, drawing from two sociologi-
cal theories, we examine if and how two salient dimensions
of social relations affect health assessments. Second, while
virtually all studies are conducted within one country, the
present research is cross-cultural. Drawing from moderniza-
tion theory, samples of elders from four Western Pacific
nations are used to determine if social integration and social
contributions influence the way older people assess their
health. We first consider the research literature in light of
two major sociological theories and then turn to moderniza-
tion theory for specifying anticipated effects in a cross-
cultural context.
Theoretical Background
Two theories are considered helpful for better explicating
the possible relationships between social relations and health
assessments in this research: social integration and social
exchange. Durkheim's (1951 [1897]) theory of social inte-
gration revealed the importance of social relationships such
as marriage, parenthood, religious involvement, and em-
ployment for promoting well-being (i.e., reducing suicide)
by providing a sense of meaning and purpose in life.
Durkheim pointed out that social integration creates a set of
constraints or controls on individual behavior such that the
traditional and stable rules of conduct characteristic of so-
cially cohesive groups give members a sense of certainty and
purpose in living. Although integration in social groups may
not always promote health, from this perspective, it is
usually better to be integrated than isolated. Social integra-
tion often leads to social support, thereby protecting the
S27
S28 SU AND FERRARO
person against the uncertainty and despair that may lead to
disordered functioning (Thoits, 1982).
Social integration theory, therefore, focuses on the ways
in which social linkages and social networks may control or
regulate an individual's behavior or thoughts and feelings in
ways that generally promote better health or well-being.
Social integration, as defined by House, Umberson, and
Landis (1988), refers to "the existence or quantity of social
ties or relationships, which may in turn be distinguished as to
type (e.g., marital, kin/nonkin) andfrequency of contact. A
person's degree of social integration/isolation is a function
only of the number of relationships s/he has with other
people or the frequency of interaction with those people'' (p.
302; emphasis in original). It is important from an integra-
tion perspective to gauge the sociometric linkages individ-
uals have, for these are seen as pivotal in shaping health and
morale. Previous research generally shows that structural
properties are important, but more consequential to health
and well-being are the content of those relations (Krause,
1987, 1995; Seeman, Seeman, and Sayles, 1985; Stoller,
1984). For the present study, therefore, we hypothesize that
among persons with similar levels of health status, social
integration will independently affect health assessments.
Although social integration may have positive or negative
effects on health, we hypothesize that social integration will
be associated with more favorable evaluations of health.
The second theoretical perspective considered is social
exchange theory, which views social life as analogous to
economic transactions and shares many tenets with behav-
ioral psychology. "Any action provides some rewards and
entails some costs. Rewards can assume many forms includ-
ing not only money, goods, and services, but also prestige,
status, and approval by others" as people attempt to "maxi-
mize rewards and minimize costs" (Michener, DeLamater,
and Schwartz, 1986, p. 13). In addition, social exchange
theory maintains that people will establish stable relation-
ships only if they find it profitable to continue their exchange
of goods and/or services. An individual judges the attractive-
ness of a relationship by comparing the profits it provides
against the profits available in other, alternative relation-
ships. The profit available in the best alternative relationship
is termed the individual's comparison level for alternatives
(Blau, 1964; Thibaut and Kelley, 1959).
It is quite common that people entering advanced old age
tend to become more dependent on others helping them with
activities of daily living or health maintenance functions
(Dowd, 1975). After a lifetime of typically giving more to
younger persons than they received from them, elders must
increasingly come to accept beneficence; for parents, the
beneficence most often comes from children (Dowd, 1984).
This is difficult for many, despite the fact they have estab-
lished a "social credit" from past contributions, because
they may have less to offer to balance the relationship. In
other words, their growing dependency on adult children
may make them feel awkward. In such cases, it is possible
that in addition to the actual health problems influencing
health assessments, the awkwardness of continually receiv-
ing beneficence without being able to contribute meaning-
fully to social relationships may make them more negative
about life and their health. The key issue appears to be what
the older person can contribute to a relationship to foster a
sense of reciprocity.
While several studies have examined help given to the
elder (e.g., Brackbill and Kitch, 1991; Langer, 1990; Wen-
towski, 1981), according to exchange theory, help given by
elders may be more important for understanding how they
feel about themselves and life. If they give to the relation-
ship, they are probably more independent, but if they give
little to the relationship, social dependency may be more
likely. Therefore, we hypothesize that among persons with
similar levels of functional health status, elders who contrib-
ute more to their social networks will more positively assess
their health. (There is also the possibility that high levels of
social contributions may be associated with poorer health
ratings because of feelings of uncompensated exchanges.
We hypothesize the positive effect but will conduct two-
tailed tests.) Although it may risk oversimplification, social
integration theory focuses on how structural linkages in-
fluence outcomes, while social exchange theory focuses on
how contributions to the networks are consequential.
Most of the literature on social relations and health assess-
ments comes from single-nation studies, many of them
surveying Americans. Still, there are other investigations
which examine these issues in Canada (McDaniel and
McKinnon, 1993) or other developed nations such as France
(Grand et al., 1988, 1990), Japan (Sugisawa, Liang, and
Liu, 1994), Israel (Auslander and Litwin, 1991), Poland
(Synak, 1987), and Sweden (Hanson et al., 1989; Mullins,
Sheppard, and Andersson, 1991). Most of these studies
show that older people who are less integrated assess their
health more negatively (Auslander and Litwin, 1991; Mul-
lins, Sheppard, and Andersson, 1991; McDaniel and
McKinnon, 1993). Despite these single-nation studies, we
are unaware of any comparative studies related to this topic.
Social integration theory was developed after the industrial
revolution, in part, because many social linkages were
substantially altered by modernization. Social exchange the-
ory is even more recent, and it is conceivable that the
utilitarian emphasis of the perspective may make its applica-
tion more appropriate for modern societies. There is a dearth
of research on how social relations affect health status and
health assessments in less developed nations, let alone com-
parative studies. Yet, different social and cultural contexts
may shape the way social relations influence health and
health assessments.
Modernization theory asserted that elders' status is gener-
ally higher in the less developed nations (Cowgill, 1986;
Cowgill and Holmes, 1972) and, with the exception of
simple nomadic societies, some empirical research supports
this assertion (e.g., Cox, 1990; Palmore and Manton, 1974).
On the other hand, there is a substantial literature from
anthropologists, historians, and sociologists showing that
modernization theory oversimplified the "plight" of older
adults (Haber and Gratton, 1994). For instance, the decline
in status for older people may have actually preceded mod-
ernization and been caused by cultural change, not industri-
alization (Fischer, 1977; Haber, 1983). Despite these limita-
tions of modernization theory for specifying causal
mechanisms, it may be useful as a heuristic framework for
hypothesizing associations between social relations, mod-
SOCIAL RELATIONS AND HEALTH ASSESSMENTS S29
ernization, and orientations to health. If elders are more
revered in traditional cultures -- especially the Asian cul-
tures studied here -- one might hypothesize that contribu-
tions to the social order to maintain reciprocity will be less
important in the traditional nations, where elders' status is
generally higher than in modern nations. We would also
expect social integration to be greater in less developed
nations and characterized by more proximate and enduring
ties. Thus, one might hypothesize that social integration in
less developed nations will have a stronger effect on health
assessments than would be the case in more developed
nations. The rationale for this expectation is that people on
the low end of the integration distribution in traditional
societies would feel slighted in comparison to their peers
(while limited integration in modern societies may seem less
important). Of course, this is an empirical question and
integration effects may vary by type (e.g., family vs associa-
tions). Given the lack of previous cross-cultural research on
the topic, the present investigation seeks to enhance our
understanding of how social relations affect health assess-
ments by considering older adults from four Western Pacific
nations at various stages of modernization. To summarize,
we anticipate that social integration's effect on health assess-
ments will be stronger in traditional societies, but that the
effect of social contributions on health assessments will be
stronger in more modern societies.
METHOD
Samples
Data for this research came from the 1983-1985 survey,
Social and Health Aspects ofAging in Fiji, Korea, Malaysia
and the Philippines, sponsored by the World Health Organi-
zation. This cross-national survey was conducted in 1984
and obtained interview responses from 3,577 individuals.
Although the survey was conducted a decade ago, its suit-
ability for cross-national comparison and tests of social
theories of aging make it unique for this study.
The same questionnaire was used to sample older people
living in households in all four countries. To improve com-
prehension and validity of the questionnaire across different
cultures, the questionnaire for each nation was translated
into the language and dialect, and back-translated into En-
glish to compare the differences and minimize problems
associated with cultural differences (Andrews, 1986). Dif-
ferent sampling designs were used for each country, and
response rates were generally quite high -- over 90%,
except for the urban Philippines sample (Metro Manila),
which had a response rate of 83.5%.
The samples in the Republic of Korea (n = 981) and Fiji
(n = 769) were designed to cover the entire countries and
random samples were applied, while in Malaysia (n =
1,000) the survey included only Peninsula Malaysia, where
purposive sampling was used. In the Philippines (n = 981),
the Tagalog region of Luzon (21 % of the Philippine popula-
tion) was sampled with a three-stage stratified cluster design.
The samples, except in Fiji, were weighted to be viewed as
representative of the populations for these areas for persons
aged 60 years and older, by sex, and by rural and urban
residence (Andrews, 1986).
Esterman and Andrews (1992) show that living arrange-
ments in the four countries are fairly similar: respondents
"lived in households which had an average size ranging
from 5.1 persons in Malaysia to 6.0 in the Philippines" (p.
276). There were relatively few elders who lived alone in
these four countries. The percentage of elders living alone
ranges from 2.0 in both Fiji and the Philippines to 5.7 in
Malaysia. As suggested by Esterman and Andrews (1992),
this is in direct contrast to the situation in most Western
nations, where up to 60 percent of elderly people live alone.
In fact, elderly people in the Western Pacific region are
almost twice as likely to live in extended households as their
European counterparts (Andrews, 1986). (In the U.S., 42%
of elders aged 65 and over lived alone in 1990, 33% lived
with a spouse, and only 13% lived with a relative other than a
spouse [U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1991].)
Despite the similarities in living arrangements, there is
considerable variability among the four nations. Table 1
profiles the four nations on 11 ecological indicators reflect-
ing state of modernization. The Republic of Korea is clearly
the most modernized of the four, especially evident on
indicators of energy consumption, telephones, TV, and
physicians per capita. The Philippines is probably the least
modernized of the four, with Fiji closer to the Philippines
and Malaysia more similar to South Korea.
The analysis is based on a sample of 3,407 noninstitu-
tionalized respondents: 969 Malaysians, 806 Filipinos, 713
Fijians, and 919 Koreans. Approximately 58 percent of all
respondents are female. The average age for all respondents
is 70.24; Korean and Malaysian respondents are slightly
older than Filipinos and Fijians. Although three of the
samples were weighted to assure accurate representation,
some caution is warranted when combining the surveys
because of bias due to different sampling designs.
Measures
The surveys asked a number of questions that were related
to the concepts under investigation: health assessments, func-
tional health, social integration, social contributions, and
status characteristics. Except for the status characteristics,
multiple measures for each concept were available. The
analysis began by creating a series of additive indexes with
the items for the indexes selected based on extant research
and theory (Fillenbaum, 1988; House, Umberson, and Lan-
dis, 1988; Wilson and Cleary, 1995). All of the health
measures had very solid alpha reliabilities, but one of the
three measures of social relations had a reliability below .60
and one below .70. Therefore, factor analyses were used to
optimize the linear relationship among the items. The results
presented below are derived from principal components fac-
tor analysis with an oblique rotation, but similar results were
also obtained from factor analysis with unweighted least
squares estimation procedures. The same sets of items were
identified in the factor analyses as were specified a priori.
Health. -- A total of 13 survey questions were used to
measure various dimensions of health status (Wilson and
Cleary, 1995). These included 2 questions on the subjective
evaluation of health and 11 questions on functional health
status. The first dimension of functional health, physical

activities of daily living (ADLs), was defined by the follow-
ing items: ability to eat, to dress and undress, to take care of
one's appearance, to walk, to get in and out of bed, and to
take a bath or shower. Responses were coded unable (0),
able with help (1), and able without help (2). (See Fillen-
baum's [1988] Multidimensional Functional Assessment of
Older Adults). The second dimension, labeled instrumental
ADL (IADL), was denned by the following items: ability to
get to places out of walking distance, to go shopping for food
and clothes, and to handle money. The third dimension of
functional health, sick days, was composed of two items: (1)
how many days respondents were so sick that they could not
carry on usual activities -- such as going to work or working
around the house, and (2) how many days in the last month
the respondent was in a hospital for physical health prob-
lems. The distributions for these two items were grouped
into five categories ranging from none (coded 5) to 22-31
days (coded 1). (All health items were coded so that high
values reflect better health.)
Self-assessed health was based on two items: "How do
you feel about your present health: do you feel quite
healthy?" Responses were yes and no, coded 2 and 1,
respectively. The second question was very similar to the
widely used self-rating of health: How would you evaluate
your present health; is it: (5) very good, (4) fairly good, (3)
average, (2) fairly bad, (1) bad? The factor based on these
two items is the dependent variable for the analysis. A
description of all variables in the analyses for each country
and the four countries together is presented in Table 2 with
ranges of variables, means, standard deviations, and factor
loading scores where appropriate. (Factor variables are pre-
sented in the first row of each block.)
Social relations. -- Seventeen indicators of social rela-
tions were examined in the preliminary analyses. By exam-
ining the distribution for each item, the correlations among
the items, and properties of alternative additive indexes, a
total of 10 items on social relations were selected for further
analyses. These were identified as indicators of three dimen-
sions of social relations: social contributions, integration in
voluntary associations, and integration in family and friend
networks (House, Umberson, and Landis, 1988). Additive
indexes were created for these three domains in preliminary
analyses, but the index for social contributions had an alpha
reliability less than .60. In order to optimize the linear
relationship among the items, factor analysis was used (the
factor pattern that emerged was identical to that specified
earlier). As shown in Table 2, social contributions gauge
how much help an elder provided. Whereas beneficence for
elders in these four countries is typically high, at least higher
than in the West, higher levels of help provided probably
indicate a balance in exchange relations. The three items
probe help offered in both family and community relations.
Integration in voluntary associations was based on three
items: (1) whether the respondent belongs to a social group;
(2) the respondent's degree of participation (a leader, active,
some, or no participation); and (3) whether the respondent
belongs to a group for elderly people. Integration with
family and friends was constructed from four items: (1) how
often the respondent attends family functions; (2) how often
respondent sees relatives; (3) number of people respondent
knows well enough to visit; and (4) whether the respondent
sees family and friends frequently enough. While the fourth
item is a more subjective indicator than the other three, it is
useful as an indicator of perceived integration. (Also, corre-
lations between it and the other three are similar to those
among the other three.) Missing data in small proportions on
the social relations indicators were recoded to the mean for
respondents from each country (Hertel, 1976).
Status characteristics. -- The measurement of other vari-
ables is fairly straightforward and is depicted in Table 2.
Each of the status characteristics considered has been shown
in previous research to be important in predicting health
assessments.

Causal Framework
The issue of reverse causality between health and social
relations merits consideration in the analysis and interpreta-
tions. While Durkheim's thesis stresses the role of integra-
tion on health and well-being, certain dimensions of health
may affect social integration. In particular, functional dis-
ability may limit some types of integration. Sensitivity to
this issue is important while interpreting the findings, but the
focus of this research is on how social relations affect health
assessments after controlling for functional disability. In
addition, careful examination of the social relations indica-
tors shows that most are oriented to belonging or social
contributions based on advisory roles (e.g., family sage) and
are not directly hinged on functional ability.
RESULTS
A series of hierarchical regression analyses were per-
formed to estimate the relationships between self-assessed
health and the predictor variables (Ordinary Least Squares:
OLS). We first examine the relationships among all coun-
tries together, including dummy variables for three of the
four nations. Next, we examine whether the relationships are
different across the four nations by analyzing each nation
separately (i.e., test for statistical interaction). Table 3
presents unstandarized and standardized regression coef-
ficients along with both R2 and adjusted R2 values for the
hierarchical models estimated on all countries simultane-
ously. (Although the measure of health assessment used is a
construct of two items, supplementary analyses using or-

dered logistic and ordered probit models for self-rated health
yielded very similar results.)
Model I simply uses the functional health measures to
predict health assessments. Sixteen percent of the variance is
accounted for by ADL, IADL, and sick days alone. Taking
status characteristics into consideration, as shown in Model
II, females and more educated elders are more likely to report
positive health while there are no differences by age and
household size. Model III adds the variable measuring social
contributions and reveals that elders who are providing help
to their families or communities are more likely to report
good health. Model IV substitutes social integration for social
contributions and shows that integration in voluntary associa-
tions is nonsignificant, but integration in family and friend
networks contributes to better self-assessed health. The ef-
fects of all variables are quite similar in Model V, which
includes both social contributions and social integration.
Model VI adds three dummy variables (0,1) for the
countries, with Korea serving as the reference group. Re-
gression slopes for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Fiji show
that elders in these three nations are more likely than Korean
elders to favorably evaluate their health status, even after
controlling for all other variables. Among these three na-
tions, respondents from the Philippines assess their health
most favorably followed by Malaysia and Fiji. (A glance
back at Table 2 shows Malaysian elders with the best health
based on ADL, IADL, and sick days, but Filipinos assess
their health more favorably in the multivariate analysis.)
There is little change in the effects of the independent
variables in Model VI, except that voluntary associations has
a weak positive effect. The findings are consistent with
previous research in the U.S. showing that women, the
oldest elders, and those with higher education are more
likely to have positive health assessments (e.g., Cockerham,
Sharp, and Wilcox, 1983; Ferraro, 1980; Fillenbaum,
1979). Overall, Model VI explained nearly one-fourth of the
variance in assessed health; the R2 value is comparable to that
reported by others on U.S. samples (Idler and Angel, 1990;
Rakowski and Cryan, 1990; Seeman, Seeman, and Sayles,
1985). As hypothesized, social integration and social contri-
butions positively affect health assessments.
Supplementary analyses treating the indicators of social
contributions separately reveal that the more an elder can
help to make family decisions, the more likely the elder
positively evaluates his or her health. On the other hand,
help looking after children and consultation regarding com-
munity problems were nonsignificant in predicting health
assessments.
Country-Specific Regression Analysis
As the regression equation for Model VI of Table 3
suggests, there are differences among countries in self-
assessed health. We can also see the difference between self-
assessed health, functional health, voluntary associations,
family and friends, and social contributions among the four
countries in Table 2. Therefore, country-specific OLS regres-
sion analyses were conducted to test for different associations
between the predictor variables and outcome variable for each
country. Moreover, in order to see if there is interaction
between countries and other predictor variables, models were
SOCIAL RELATIONS AND HEALTH ASSESSMENTS S33
estimated separately for each country. Rather than simply
comparing slopes, tests of differences of slopes (t-value) were
calculated according to the following formula:
MSE\ + SE\
where b refers to the unstandardized coefficient and SE refers
to the standard error of b (Marascuilo and Levin, 1983, p.
101). Table 4 presents unstandarized coefficients, standard-
ized coefficients, standard error of regression coefficients,
and R2 values for each country. Standardized coefficients are
provided for interpretations within a given country but
should not be used for cross-national comparisons. As be-
fore, Korea serves as a reference group for the analysis of
differences in slopes.
In Korea, all forms of social relations affected health
assessments and each effect is in the hypothesized direction.
Social relations appear to most affect the health interpreta-
tion process in the most modernized of the four countries. As
mentioned earlier, according to modernization theory, we
hypothesized that contributions to the social order will be
less important in the less developed nations and more impor-
tant in more modernized nations. In the country-specific
analyses, we find that Korea, as the most modern nation in
the analysis, is the only nation where social contributions are
significant in affecting elders' health assessments. Cultural
images of productivity and the ability to contribute to family
or society apparently influence self-assessments of health
through the exchange process.
Results for Malaysia indicate that functional health status,
education, and interaction in voluntary associations and
family and friend networks significantly affect assessed
health. The t-values for age and for voluntary associations
reflect interactions: the oldest elders in Korea are more
favorable in evaluating their health but this is not the case in
Malaysia; integration in voluntary associations in Malaysia
is negatively related to health assessments, but it is posi-
tively related in Korea.
The regression model for Fiji shows that functional health
has a significant influence on elders' health assessments, but
the effect of sick days is not as strong as in Korea. Women
and those with more education rate their health more favor-
ably. Better assessed health is also found among elders with
higher levels of voluntary association integration. An inter-
action between social contributions and country suggests
that, unlike Koreans, social contributions do not influence
health assessments among Fijian elders.
Finally, in the Philippines, the youngest and least modern-
ized of the four countries, social contributions do not signifi-
cantly affect health assessments. While social contributions
have a substantial positive effect on subjective health assess-
ments among Korean elders, no such effect is present among
Filipinos (and the respective slopes are significantly differ-
ent). Examining other contrasts for the Philippines and
Korea shows that IADL and age contribute less to health
assessments in the Philippines. The only variables which
significantly influence assessed health among Filipinos are
the functional health indicators and integration in family and
friend networks.
DISCUSSION
This research was designed to contribute to our under-
standing of how social relations influence the health interpre-
tation process. The two major aims identified were to exam-
ine (1) how two important domains of social activity affect
self-assessed health among older adults, and (2) whether

these relationships vary cross-culturally. We are unaware of
any study in the literature which has combined these scien-
tific aims.
The two domains of social relations considered were
social integration and social contributions in social ex-
changes. While previous research suggested the importance
of each, most studies suggested that content of relations and
active contributions to relations would be more important
(Krause, 1987; Stoller, 1984). In the cross-cultural analysis
undertaken, only social integration was found to be an
important influence on health assessments in all countries.
Integration in family and friend networks aided health as-
sessments in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Korea while
integration in voluntary associations had a positive effect
only in Fiji and Korea. Unexpectedly, voluntary association
integration had a slight negative effect on health assessments
in Malaysia, perhaps because of the unique character of
voluntary associations oriented to needy elders there. What-
ever the case, there is ample evidence of the importance of
social network integration in shaping health assessments,
consistent with social integration theory (Durkheim, 1951
[1897]; House, Umberson, and Landis, 1988; Thoits, 1982).
The significant effect is always positive for these countries
when it comes to integration in family and friend networks.
The effects due to voluntary association integration are
generally weaker, but positive in two out of the four nations
and negative in only one. While some caution is needed
when generalizing regarding modernization from just these
four nations, it appears that voluntary association integration
is least consequential -- either positive or negative -- when
the level of modernization is low (i.e., the Philippines).
While it has received previous little attention in survey
research, we also considered elders' contribution to others in
social exchanges. Despite hypothesizing that such contribu-
tions would favorably influence health evaluations, this
relationship was observed only among people of the Repub-
lic of Korea, the most modernized nation of the four. This
provides some support for social exchange theory because
the content of exchanges, in addition to structural properties,
also affect health assessments (Krause, 1987; Stoller, 1984).
However, this relationship was not observed in any of the
other, less modernized nations. Thus, it appears that contri-
butions to the social order are more important in modernized
societies, presumably because productivity is valued more.
If elders contribute to exchange relationships in modern
societies, their health assessments, and we may speculate
morale, are more favorable. On the other hand, in more
traditional societies, perhaps especially traditional Pacific
and Asian societies, structural integration is sufficient to
bolster health assessments in the face of poor functional
health, and social contributions do not further aid subjective
health.
Evaluating one's health status does not occur in a social
vacuum; and the health interpretation process is shaped not
only by physical health problems and status characteristics
but by social status, structure, and participation. The lack of
an effect on health assessments due to contributions to the
social order among three of the four countries should cer-
tainly not be interpreted as a refutation of social exchange
theory. There is clearly a need for further research on how
levels of modernization influence health interpretations, and
the measures of social relations available in this survey are
limited. Yet, the findings presented here should temper
assertions about the role of reciprocity when beneficence to
elders is normative, especially in less developed countries or
even in subcultural contexts. Structural integration was im-
portant to health interpretations across all societies consid-
ered here, but the importance of elders actively contributing
to the social order was consequential in the most modern
society only: Korea. In summary, we hypothesized that
modernization should increase the impact of social contribu-
tions on health assessments, and these results confirm that
hypothesis. We also hypothesized that modernization should
decrease the impact of social integration on health assess-
ments, but there is insufficient evidence to support this
hypothesis: integration was influential in all four countries.
Age differences in health assessments have also attracted
attention among researchers because they are not always
intuitively understood. There is an emerging body of litera-
ture in the United States that the oldest members of the senior
population do not always have more negative health rating
despite their higher levels of morbidity and functional limita-
tion (e.g., Cockerham, Sharp, and Wilcox, 1983; Ferraro,
1980; Idler, 1993). Parallel to these findings, the present
study also finds that the oldest members of the senior
population in Korea are more positive in evaluating their
health after controlling for functional health status. Of
course, the flip side of this interpretation is that the younger
members of the elderly population are somewhat pessimistic
in evaluating their health. As we observed this effect only
among the Korean elders suggests, once again, that cultural
images constructed from productivity and retirement may be
part of the reason researchers have observed a more negative
tone in health interpretations among those close to, ap-
proaching, or recently entering the "retirement years."
This research is not without its limitations. First, for
Malaysia and the Philippines, the surveys cover only selected
regions of the nation whereas for Korea and Fiji, the surveys
cover the entire country. This is not a serious flaw given the
comparative emphasis here and the dearth of related research,
but it does constrain external validity for those two nations.
Second, no measures of morbidity were available in the
survey. While the three sets of indicators of functional health
explain respectable levels of variance in health assessments
(similar to reports by Idler and Angel, 1990; Rakowski and
Cryan, 1990; Seeman, Seeman, and Sayles, 1985), we would
have preferred to include morbidity indicators in the analysis.
Of course, measuring morbidity across cultures is no simple
matter given differences in actual morbidity as well as liter-
acy, educational attainment, and cultural definitions of ill-
nesses. Whereas our hypotheses focused on the role of social
relations, adequate measures of functional health are even
more important given the correlation between the two. Never-
theless, the absence of indicators of morbidity merits caution
when interpreting the results. Third, the analysis did not
examine the possibility of reciprocal linkages between social
relations and health assessments. Although thefindingsin the
study suggest that social relations have a positive effect on
health assessments, it is also possible that better health leads
to stronger social integration and social contributions. Defini-
SOCIAL RELATIONS AND HEALTH ASSESSMENTS S35
tive tests of such interpretations, however, are not generally
feasible with cross-sectional data. Fourth, because different
sampling designs are used in the four nations, some caution is
needed regarding external validity. Finally, the measures of
social contributions are limited. Contributions to family in-
come and wealth were not measured, but may be important as
well.
Despite the limitations, this is the first study of which we
are aware that examines the contributions of social relations
to the health interpretation process in a cross-cultural frame-
work. The data clearly show the importance of social rela-
tions influencing health assessments above and beyond ef-
fects due to functional health and status characteristics.
Social integration has a salubrious effect in all four nations,
but contributions to the social order influence health assess-
ments only in the most modernized nation. The findings
suggest not only that social life is important to health
interpretation but that the social status of elders and norms of
beneficence, reflected in these four cultures, are also impor-
tant when older people seek to classify their state of bodily
function and overall health.
