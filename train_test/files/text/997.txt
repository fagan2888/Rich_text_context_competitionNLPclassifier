Access And Quality: Does Rural
America Lag Behind?
In 2000­01, the overall rural supply of providers was adequate to
provide access to care on par with that in urban areas.
by James D. Reschovsky and Andrea B. Staiti
ABSTRACT: Numerous state and federal programs and policies aim to improve rural health
care. This study compares access to and quality of medical care in urban and rural areas
from the perspective of physicians and patients, using a broad set of indicators taken from
the 2000­2001 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician and Household Surveys. Across
most dimensions examined, access and quality in rural areas--even rural counties not adja-
cent to metropolitan areas--were either equivalent or superior to that provided in urban ar-
eas. However, rural residents have greater difficulty obtaining mental health services and
generally face greater financial barriers to care.
Strong congressional forces regularly advocate for increased support
for rural health care, based in part on perceptions that access to and quality
of care in rural areas lag behind those in urban areas. These perceptions de-
rive in part from research showing that per capita physician supply is lower in ru-
ral areas and that smaller inpatient facilities there lack some technology-intensive
services.1 Also, some believe that lower Medicare payments deter physicians from
practicing in rural areas, although payment formulas actually compensate rural
physicians better than urban physicians relative to local practice costs.
As such, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act (MMA) of 2003 included funds for rural hospitals and home health agencies
and increased Medicare payments to all rural physicians, with additional pay-
ments going to those practicing in underserved areas. This is on top of existing
federal programs encouraging physicians to practice in underserved areas and
subsidies for other rural services. On the other hand, President Bush's proposed
fiscal year 2006 budget either greatly cuts or eliminates a number of rural health
programs.2 Given this recent policy activity, this is an opportune time to examine
differences in rural and urban patients' access to and quality of care.
We compare health care in urban and rural areas from both physician and pa-
tient perspectives. Our assessments do not encompass hospital quality, although
we include perceptions of both hospital- and non-hospital-based physicians. In

addition to urban-rural comparisons, we also compare how areas that are more or
less rural compare with urban areas as well as with each other. With some impor-
tant exceptions, the general picture that emerges is that across many dimensions,
quality and access in rural areas are at least on par with urban areas.
Study Data And Methods
Data are primarily from the 2000­2001 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Phy-
sician and Household Surveys, conducted by the Center for Studying Health Sys-
tem Change. Samples were representative of the population of physicians and ci-
vilian, noninstitutionalized individuals in the forty-eight contiguous states
(12,406 and 59,725, respectively) in 2000­01. Samples were clustered in sixty local
health care markets, comprising fifty-one metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs)
and nine nonmetropolitan portions of economic areas defined by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA), supplemented by a nonclustered sample, comprising
roughly 10 percent of all interviews to enhance the statistical power of national
estimates.
Detailed information on demographics, insurance coverage, health care use, and
attitudes was gathered about all adult family members and one randomly selected
child in the Household Survey. The Physician Survey obtained detailed informa-
tion on demographics, practices, and attitudes for nonfederal patient care physi-
cians providing at least twenty hours of direct patient care per week. Both surveys
used telephone interviews, supplemented in the Household Survey with in-
person interviews of households without telephones. We classified physicians
and patients by the location of their practice or home, respectively. Urban areas
are defined as those contained in MSAs; rural areas fall outside of MSAs. We fur-
ther divided rural areas into those adjacent or nonadjacent to an MSA (Exhibit 1).3
We compared the mean characteristics of urban physicians and patients with
those of their rural peers. Statistical significance tests accounted for the CTS sur-
veys' complex sampling structure. For selected measures, we calculated regres-

sion-adjusted means to hold constant a set of predictors. Comparisons discussed
in the text, unless otherwise stated, are statistically significant at the 5 percent
level.
We confirmed urban-rural differences in physician and patient characteristics
found in previous studies (data not shown).4 Female physicians were underrepre-
sented in rural areas (19 percent versus 24 percent in urban areas). Contrary to
common perceptions that rural physicians are older than urban physicians, rural
physicians tended to be slightly younger. Primary care physicians (PCPs), particu-
larly general and family practitioners, made up a larger portion of the physician
workforce in rural than in urban areas (49 percent versus 30 percent). Conversely,
specialists made up a smaller portion of the rural physician workforce (23 percent
versus 37 percent). Rural physicians were less involved with managed care plans
but relied more on revenue from Medicare and Medicaid than their urban coun-
terparts.
The supply of physicians, particularly specialists, was much lower in rural ar-
eas. There were 5.3 PCPs and 5.4 specialists per 10,000 population in rural areas,
compared with 7.8 and 13.4, respectively, in urban areas. Referral patterns between
rural and urban areas likely explain some of the difference in specialist supply,
since many rural areas were unlikely to be able to support subspecialist practices.
Consistent with this, physician supply was greater in nonadjacent rural counties
than adjacent ones, although still much lower than urban areas. Conversely, the
supply of hospital beds (from American Hospital Association data) was greater in
rural areas than in urban areas (36 versus 29 per 10,000 population).5
Rural residents were older and were more likely to be uninsured or covered by
public insurance, to have lower incomes, and to be in poorer health on average.6
Generally, residents of counties nonadjacent to metropolitan areas tended to be
more disadvantaged than those in adjacent counties, with lower incomes and rates
of insurance coverage.
Urban-Rural Access Differences
Access to care defies simple measurement; it encompasses both patients' care-
seeking decisions and system responses once the patient has initiated contact. We
framed our comparisons around three sets of potential barriers, which all plausi-
bly point to lower access to care in rural areas. The first set relates to "convenience
of use." Because of lower population density and fewer providers in rural areas, pa-
tients may wait longer to get appointments, travel longer to see providers, and
wait longer in doctors' offices. Less convenient access essentially makes care more
costly to use. The second set is "provider supply" factors. Having fewer providers
in rural areas may make it more difficult to obtain services because physicians are
less likely to accept new patients and can charge higher fees, or because physicians
themselves will have difficulties getting the services their patients need. The third
set of factors, "patient resource constraints," is related to patients' demand for ser-

vices. Because rural patients tend to be poorer and are less likely to have insurance
coverage, they are more likely to face financial barriers that discourage seeking
care and hinder their providers' ability to obtain services for them.7 Hence, the de-
mand for care will be lower in rural areas.
n General access measures. Exhibit 2 presents access indicators. First, we
present three general access measures from the CTS Household Survey: any unmet
medical need, whether getting needed care was put off, and whether patients had a
usual source of care. There were no significant differences in the percentage report-

ing unmet needs between rural and urban areas, and rural patients were only
slightly more likely to report delayed care (p  .10). Rural patients were more likely
to report having a usual source of care--long identified as an important component
of access to care and crucial for ensuring continuity of care (Exhibit 2).
n Convenience of use. In the CTS Household Survey, patients who had a physi-
cian visit in the past year (about 80 percent of all respondents) were asked about
their last visit (PCP or specialist), including the time it took to get an appointment
and to get to the doctor's office and the wait in the office before being seen.

Results were mixed. The average number of days needed to get an appointment
with a PCP did not differ significantly between urban and rural patients, but rural
patients reported longer waits to get specialist appointments. As expected, the
time reported traveling to the physician was longer in rural areas, although differ-
ences were not great.8 Travel times to specialists were longer, with a twenty-
minute urban-rural differential (Exhibit 2). There were no significant urban-rural
differences in wait times in PCP or specialists' offices (data not shown).
Household Survey respondents reporting unmet or delayed care needs were
asked to list reasons. We identified several related to convenience factors (Exhibit
2). Of these, only the first had significant urban-rural differences, with urban resi-
dents more likely to indicate that they couldn't get an appointment soon enough.
This suggests that although rural patients might have had longer waits, they were
less likely to consider this a reason for experiencing delayed or unmet care needs.
n Provider supply. If the lower supply of physicians in rural areas affects access
to care, this might be reflected in fewer rural physicians accepting new patients. Al-
though there was little urban-rural difference in the percentage of physicians ac-
cepting new private patients, rural physicians were more likely to accept new Medi-
care, Medicaid, and uninsured patients. They also provided more charity care,
although differences are not statistically significant (Exhibit 2).
Although highly important, getting in to see a physician does not guarantee ac-
cess to care. Physicians have to be able to obtain the needed services. We next
show the percentage of physicians indicating that they had difficulty obtaining
various services for their patients.9 Surprisingly, rural physicians were less likely
than their urban counterparts to report problems obtaining needed services (Ex-
hibit 2). Despite the low specialist supply in rural areas, there was little difference
across urban and rural areas in the ability to obtain referrals to high-quality spe-
cialists. Rural physicians were less likely to indicate problems obtaining hospital
admissions, ancillary services, and diagnostic imaging. However, they were much
more likely to report problems obtaining inpatient mental health services.10
The Physician Survey asked physicians who indicated difficulties obtaining
these services how important the lack of qualified providers (or facilities), health
plan networks or administrative procedures, or patients with no or inadequate in-
surance coverage were in explaining these difficulties. Results suggest that urban
and rural physicians differed in the reasons contributing to problems obtaining
needed services (data not shown). Among those indicating problems obtaining
services, the lack of qualified providers was more often cited as an important fac-
tor by rural than urban physicians in the case of specialist referrals (85 percent
versus 40 percent), mental health outpatient services (88 percent versus 66 per-
cent), and hospital admission (37 percent versus 29 percent), although the last
comparison was significant only at the 10 percent level.
We next assess whether patients perceived an inadequate supply of physicians.
Patients were asked whether they were satisfied with their choice of PCPs and

specialists. Little difference was found in responses between urban and rural re-
spondents. These comparisons might be confounded by greater health mainte-
nance organization (HMO) penetration in urban areas. When we compared satis-
faction with physician choice separately for those insured by HMO and non-HMO
plans, we found that rural patients covered by non-HMOs were less likely than
their urban counterparts to be dissatisfied with the choice of specialists.
n Patient resource constraints. As indicated, rural residents were poorer and
less likely to have insurance coverage than urban residents, which suggests that they
will face greater resource constraints in accessing care.11 Indeed, the percentage of
people reporting out-of-pocket health care spending in excess of 5 percent of in-
come was much greater in rural than urban areas (Exhibit 2).
When Household Survey respondents who indicated they had unmet or de-
layed care needs were asked to list reasons, the most prevalent reason given by
both urban and rural residents was concern about the cost. Rural residents were
much more likely than urban residents to give this response, which suggests that
patients' financial differences figure prominently in urban-rural access-to-care
differences (Exhibit 2). On the other hand, rural physicians indicating serious
problems obtaining specialist referrals, hospital admissions, or outpatient mental
health services were no more likely than urban physicians to mention patients' in-
adequate insurance coverage as an important factor (data not shown).
n Urban-rural differences in utilization. Although often used to indicate access
to care, use of health care provides an imperfect measure. This is because we do not
know what the "right" level of use is and because overuse of services is common (and
potentially harmful). We examined selected annual health care usage measures for
urban and rural patients. Because there were significant population differences
across urban and rural areas that were likely to affect the demand for health care, we
present regression-adjusted means that control for demand-side factors: age, sex, in-
come, health status, family composition, and type of insurance coverage. Adjusted
means provide a better indicator of usage differences attributable to disparities in
the provider supply, including the effect on convenience of use. However, additional
unmeasured patient-demand factors, such as cultural differences, could also ac-
count for the remaining urban-rural differences.
Rural residents had more adjusted annual hospital admissions (excluding for
births) than urban residents, although the total length-of-stay did not differ sig-
nificantly (Exhibit 2). Controlling for demand factors reduced estimated rural
hospital use, which suggests that rural residents are more likely than their urban
peers to have conditions or injuries requiring hospitalization.
Findings were mixed regarding outpatient utilization. Use of hospital emer-
gency departments for conditions not requiring an overnight stay serves as an in-
dicator of access to outpatient care, but little difference between urban and rural
residents was found.12 On the other hand, rural residents were found to have fewer
outpatient visits (Exhibit 2). Similar patterns were evident when only physician

visits are examined (data not shown). Rural residents made greater use of nonphy-
sician providers than urban residents. Finally, consistent with physician difficul-
ties obtaining mental health care, rural residents were less likely than urban resi-
dents were to report a mental health visit (Exhibit 2).
Quality Of Care
For this study, we lacked specific clinical measures of health care quality and
relied mostly on physicians' and patients' perceptions. One objective measure, al-
though limited, is physician board certification.13 Rural specialists were less likely
than urban specialists to be board certified, although no differences were found
among PCPs, who figure more prominently in the care of rural residents than ur-
ban residents (Exhibit 3). However, our subjective quality measures consistently
pointed to a conclusion of better-quality care in rural areas.
Physicians were asked how much they agreed with statements related to their
ability to provide high-quality care (Exhibit 3). In all cases, rural physicians were
less likely than their urban peers to disagree with the statements, which indicates
higher perceived quality. One possible explanation is the smaller influence of
managed care in rural areas; to account for this, we also calculated regression-
adjusted means that control for physicians' HMO involvement.14 This narrowed
urban-rural differences only slightly, and some lost their statistical significance.
Generally, rural PCPs treated a broader range of conditions and were more
likely than urban PCPs to staff emergency departments. One concern is whether
the scope of care rural PCPs are expected to provide without referral is broader
than it should be. Rural PCPs do not perceive this to be the case. PCPs were asked
whether the complexity or severity of patients' conditions for which they pro-
vided care without referral to specialists was greater than it should be, about
right, or less than it should be. Although 28 percent of urban PCPs indicated it
was greater than it should be, only 22 percent of rural PCPs did so.15
Greater perceived quality among rural physicians was confirmed by patients'
reports. Patients with a doctor's appointment in the past year were asked how
much they trusted their doctor to meet their medical care needs and were asked to
rate the thoroughness of the exam during their last physician visit and how well
their physician explained things. In each case, rural patients gave more positive re-
sponses about their physicians, although differences were small and only signifi-
cant at the 10 percent level. However, rural patients were slightly more likely than
their urban peers to indicate that their physician might be performing unneces-
sary tests and procedures (Exhibit 3).16
Adjacent Versus Nonadjacent Rural Areas
Only a few access indicators differed significantly between adjacent and non-
adjacent rural counties (Exhibit 2). Among these, no consistent pattern emerges
indicating that access is better or worse in nonadjacent counties than in adjacent

ones. Problems of patient resource constraints were greater in nonadjacent coun-
ties, reflecting residents' lower incomes and rates of insurance coverage. More-
over, accessing specialist care appeared to be less convenient in nonadjacent coun-
ties. On the other hand, nonadjacent rural residents were less likely than those in
adjacent rural counties to have emergency department visits that did not result in

Conclusions And Policy Implications
n Limitations. This study is unique in bringing together both physicians' and
patients' perspectives and in employing a broad set of access and quality indicators;
however, it does have limitations. First, by reporting means across large geographic
divisions, we provided a broad picture but could not address the considerable varia-
tion likely within both urban and rural areas. Second, some of the access measures
and nearly all of the quality measures were subjective in nature. Urban-rural differ-
ences in these measures could be affected by differing cultural values, experiences,
expectations, and standards among respondents.
n Physician/patient perspectives. In general, physicians and patients pro-
vided concordant perspectives on access to and quality of care in urban and rural ar-
eas. While perceived quality was consistently found to be superior in rural areas, a
more complex picture emerged with respect to access.
Because rural residents were poorer and less likely to be insured than their ur-
ban peers, they faced greater access problems related to cost. This suggests that
policymakers should employ policies aimed at increasing low-income patients'
purchasing power by expanding safety-net, income assistance, or public health in-
surance programs. Even broad-based reforms not specifically targeted to rural ar-
eas would alleviate some of the disparities we observed. These "demand-side"
access problems could be somewhat mitigated by rural physicians' greater will-
ingness to serve these patients. Although rural physicians worked longer hours
than urban physicians, they appeared to be more willing to accept patients for
whom they were likely to obtain little or no compensation: Medicaid recipients
and the uninsured.17 This could be in recognition that few, if any, local alternatives
exist; however, rural physicians' greater willingness to treat disadvantaged pa-
tients could also reflect greater "social capital" in rural areas--that is, the "norms
and networks that enable collective action."18
Although rural areas have far fewer physicians than urban areas, our results
suggest that in 2000­01, overall rural supply was adequate to provide access to
care on par with that in urban areas. Lower rural supply does not necessarily im-
ply inadequate supply, as geographic differences may reflect oversupply in urban
areas or differences in patients' demand for care.19 Moreover, for some specialized
services, it is reasonable to expect that rural patients will use urban providers.
If the supply of rural providers were inadequate, we would expect that patients
would have to wait for appointments and that physicians would be unable to ob-
tain needed services for their patients. We observed neither of these situations.
Longer travel distances to providers also could be an implication, although this
would also be expected because of lower population densities in rural areas. Gen-
erally, we saw little evidence suggesting that an inadequate supply of providers

prevented rural patients from obtaining needed care. Some evidence does point to
localized areas of shortage, however. One area where provider shortages did ap-
pear to be pervasive is mental health. Rural physicians reported greater difficulties
getting these services for their patients and were more likely to cite supply prob-
lems as the reason. Moreover, rural patients reported fewer mental health visits
than their urban counterparts.
Rural health care policy is in a state of flux. With respect to de-
mand-side programs, Bush administration support for additional commu-
nity health centers will alleviate patient resource constraints in many rural
areas, while proposed Medicaid cuts, which are much larger in magnitude, would
likely have the opposite effect for at least some segments of the rural and urban
low-income populations.
On the supply side, MMA contained some $17 billion over ten years in rural
health care subsidies, the price of obtaining key Senate support for the Medicare
drug benefit. (Our results predate MMA implementation.) The MMA subsidies
mostly benefit small rural hospitals, although the Medicare Bonus Payment Pro-
gram, for physicians practicing in designated shortage areas, was enhanced; the
Medicare fee formula was altered to increase payments to physicians practicing in
low-cost, mostly rural areas; and payments to some other providers were raised.
However, the MMA provisions are now being used to justify deep cuts or elimina-
tion of a number of other rural health programs in the administration's FY 2006
budget.
Although our results do not allow us to make assessments about the appropri-
ate level of support for rural health care, they do suggest that cuts in low-income
entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, will have a disproportionate effect on ru-
ral populations, where enrollments relative to the size of the population are
higher. Our results also suggest that subsidies directed to rural health care provid-
ers would be best targeted to those geographic areas with demonstrated short-
ages. This suggests, for instance, that enhancements to the geographically tar-
geted Medicare Bonus Payment Program and some of the smaller programs slated
for cuts or elimination may have greater effects on access to care in rural areas than
the MMA's broad-based physician payment formula changes and critical-access
hospital provisions. Finally, broad-based programs might be appropriate when
they are focused on a specific type of service, such as mental health care, for which
widespread and serious problems have been shown to exist in rural areas.

3. We also classified rural counties as those with and without at least 20,000 people living in towns and
small cities. Results were often similar across these two classification schemes. We report results based on
urban-area adjacency, because this is thought to be most relevant to issues of quality and access.

regression-adjusted means controlling for this. These controls affected results very little and are not re-

in prevalence of surgical procedures.
13. Board certification has been found associated with better clinical quality; see, for example, L.K. Sharp et
al., "Specialty Board Certification and Clinical Outcomes: The Missing Link," Academic Medicine 77, no. 6
(2002): 534­542. However, specialty mix and age patterns may confound urban/rural comparisons.

15. PCPs' assessment were confirmed by reports from specialists, who responded to a question whether the
complexity or severity of patients at the time of referral by PCPs was greater or less than it should be, or
about right. While 26 percent of rural specialists indicated that conditions were more complex or severe
than they should be at the time of referral, one-third of urban specialists indicated this.
16. Previous research using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data also indicated that quality-of-
care satisfaction levels do not differ significantly between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Schur

17. Tabulations from the CTS Physician Survey indicate that rural physicians on average work about 4 per-
cent (two hours) more each week than urban physicians. Differences are greatest among PCPs. Rural
PCPs work about 10 percent or (5 hours) more a week than urban PCPs. Rural physicians are also likely
than their urban counterparts to spend more time on call.
