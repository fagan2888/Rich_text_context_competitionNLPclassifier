to a deterioration in cognitive function
that persists well beyond any period of
acute intoxication? Is the functioning of
the brain altered in the long term? With

Context Cognitive impairments are associated with long-term cannabis use, but the
parameters of use that contribute to impairments and the nature and endurance of
cognitive dysfunction remain uncertain.
Objective To examine the effects of duration of cannabis use on specific areas of
cognitive functioning among users seeking treatment for cannabis dependence.
Design, Setting, and Participants Multisite retrospective cross-sectional neuro-
psychological study conducted in the United States (Seattle, Wash; Farmington, Conn;
and Miami, Fla) between 1997 and 2000 among 102 near-daily cannabis users (51
long-term users: mean, 23.9 years of use; 51 shorter-term users: mean, 10.2 years of
use) compared with 33 nonuser controls.
Main Outcome Measures Measures from 9 standard neuropsychological tests that
assessed attention, memory, and executive functioning, and were administered prior
to entry to a treatment program and following a median 17-hour abstinence.
Results Long-term cannabis users performed significantly less well than shorter-
term users and controls on tests of memory and attention. On the Rey Auditory Ver-
bal Learning Test, long-term users recalled significantly fewer words than either shorter-
term users (P=.001) or controls (P=.005); there was no difference between shorter-
term users and controls. Long-term users showed impaired learning (P=.007), retention
(P=.003), and retrieval (P=.002) compared with controls. Both user groups per-
formed poorly on a time estimation task (P.001 vs controls). Performance measures
often correlated significantly with the duration of cannabis use, being worse with in-
creasing years of use, but were unrelated to withdrawal symptoms and persisted after
controlling for recent cannabis use and other drug use.
Conclusions These results confirm that long-term heavy cannabis users show im-
pairments in memory and attention that endure beyond the period of intoxication and
worsen with increasing years of regular cannabis use.

gests an important role for the cannabi-

ing.21-24 Long-term use of cannabis may
result in altered functioning of the can-
nabinoidreceptoranditsassociatedneu-
romodulator systems.
This study investigated the nature of
cognitive impairments associated with
long-term cannabis use employing data
collected from a large clinical trial of
chronic users seeking treatment for can-
nabis dependence. The study com-
pared 102 cannabis users assessed prior
to treatment on carefully selected neu-
ropsychological tests with 33 nonuser
controls. The parameters of cannabis
use that contribute to impairment were
examined. It was hypothesized that per-
formance would deteriorate as the num-
ber of years of regular use increased.
METHODS
Design
A multisite, retrospective, cross-
sectional comparison-group design was
used to compare (1) long-term users
with a mean of 23.9 years of regular can-
nabis use; (2) shorter-term users with
a mean of 10.2 years of regular use; and
(3) nonusers of cannabis. Key con-
founding variables (age, IQ, other drug
use) were controlled through match-
ing or statistical methods. The sample
size required for this study was deter-
mined by estimating a 94% chance of
detecting a moderate effect size of 0.5
SD units at a 2-tailed  of .05.
Recruitment Procedure
and Assessment of Drug Use
Sixty-five of the 102 cannabis users were
delayed-treatment participants from the
Marijuana Treatment Project, a mul-
tisite US study (Seattle, Wash; Farming-
ton, Conn; and Miami, Fla) conducted
between 1997 and 2000 of the effective-
ness of brief treatments for cannabis de-
pendence.25 The remainder were re-
cruited through the Marijuana
Treatment Project specifically for this
study. Participants provided written in-
formed consent as approved by the eth-
ics committees of the participating in-
stitutions and were paid $75 for
completing the cognitive assessments.
Controls(n=33)wererecruitedfromthe
general population through media ad-
vertisements at only 1 site. The con-
trols were told that the researchers were
studying the effects of exposure to drugs
and alcohol on cognitive functioning,
and that at present only individuals at
the lighter end of the spectrum of drug
experience were required. The aim was
to minimize cannabis use among con-
trols while approximating the other
characteristics of the cannabis-using
sample. Assessors were not blinded with
regard to group assignment. Self-
reported drug and alcohol use were as-
sessed by the Addiction Severity In-
dex,26 a separate structured interview,
and the Time Line Follow Back proce-
dure.27,28 The Structured Clinical Inter-
viewforDiagnosticandStatisticalManual
of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-
IV) Axis I Disorders (SCID)29 assessed
cannabis dependence. Duration of regu-
lar (at least twice per month) cannabis
use was an averaged composite mea-
sure derived from the Addiction Sever-
ity Index, SCID, and the structured in-
terview. Current frequency of cannabis
use was calculated from the Time Line
Follow Back procedure.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Cannabis users were included if they
had used cannabis regularly for at least
3 years, were currently using at least
once a week, were seeking treatment to
assist them to cease or reduce their use
of cannabis, and were willing to par-
ticipate in the treatment program of-
fered. Participants were excluded if they
had ever had a serious illness or injury
that may have affected the brain, any
psychotic disorder, met a current
DSM-IVdiagnosisofdependenceonany
other drug or alcohol, or had a poor
command of the English language.

The user group was split at the median
for duration of cannabis use to enable
comparisonsoflong-termusers,shorter-
term users, and controls. No meaning-
ful division of groups could be achieved
onthebasisoffrequencyofcannabisuse,
which was almost daily for the major-
ity of the sample. Sex distribution and
years of education did not differ be-
tween groups. The majority of users
(68.6%) and controls (63.6%) were
white.Overall,usersandcontrolsdidnot
differ in age, but long-term users were
significantly older and shorter-term us-
ers were significantly younger than con-
trols (P.001). Premorbid intelligence
was estimated by several methods and
averaged: the Wide Range Achieve-
ment Test--Revised reading subtest
(WRAT-R READ)30,31; the North Ameri-
can Adult Reading Test (NAART)32; and
the Barona Index.33 The mean esti-
mated full-scale IQ (FSIQ) did not dif-
fer between the 3 groups based on du-
ration of cannabis use. The majority of
the sample (82.4% long-term, 88.2%
shorter-term users) reported experienc-
ing problems with memory, attention,
or concentration, which they attrib-
uted to their use of cannabis.
Cannabis Use, Required
Abstinence, and Urinalysis
Users first tried cannabis at a mean age
of 15.3 (SD, 2.6) years with regular use
(at least twice a month) commencing at
age 17.5 (SD, 3.2) years. Cannabis had
been used on a median 29 of the past 30
days (range, 1-30). Almost the entire
sample (98%) met the DSM-IV criteria
for cannabis dependence. The median
amount of cannabis smoked per week
was 1 quarter of an ounce (range, 0.01-
2.00 oz) with 2 average-sized joints typi-
callysmokedperday(range,0.12-20.00).
None of these cannabis-use parameters
differed between the long- and shorter-
term user groups. Twenty-two controls
had either never tried cannabis or used
it 10 or fewer times in their lives and 11
had used cannabis weekly to monthly
while at school or college between 4 and
30 years ago. Controls with a history of
cannabis use were excluded from "pure
sample" analyses.
Participants were required to ab-
stain from cannabis for at least 12 hours
prior to testing and to provide 2 urine
samples (1 the night before testing, an-
other during the test session). The me-
dian self-reported time since last use of
cannabis was 17 hours (range, 7-240
hours); this did not differ between long-
and shorter-term users. At the time of
testing, 70% of the sample reported that
they were not experiencing any dis-
comfort after abstaining from canna-
bis. Twice as many shorter-term users
than long-term users (P = .03) re-
ported mild withdrawal symptoms such
as cravings, irritability, depression,
anxiety, sleep, or appetite distur-
bances. In 78.3% of cases, creatinine-
normalized urinary cannabinoid me-
tabolite (THC-COOH) levels on the day
of testing were less than or equivalent
to those from the night before.34-37 Ab-
stinence from cannabis was supported
by significant correlations between the
level of normalized urinary cannabi-
noid metabolite on the day of testing
and the self-reported time since last use
(bivariate correlation coefficient
[r],-0.46; P.001), and the quantity
used on the last occasion divided by the
time since last use (r, 0.39; P.001).
The effects of these measures of re-
cent use were examined in relation to
test performance. "Pure sample" analy-
ses excluded users with higher metabo-
lites in the second urine sample. No
cannabinoid metabolites were de-
tected in the urine of the control par-
ticipants.
Other Drug Use
No other drug metabolites were de-
tected in any urine sample. Tobacco and
alcohol use was minimal. Alcohol was
consumed on a median of 3.4 and 1.7
days per month among users and con-
trols, respectively. Almost one third of
users and 46.8% of controls drank less
than once a month or not at all. Forty-
eight percent of the cannabis users had
only tried drugs other than cannabis a
few times or never; 52% had used other
drugs socially/recreationally primar-
ily during high school and college. Past
histories of regular drug use included
cocaine(n=24),amphetamines(n=11),
hallucinogens (n=17), and sedatives/
hypnotics or minor tranquilizers (n=7).
Current use of other drugs was less than
once a month or not at all for 93.1% of
the sample. More than half of the con-
trols (51.5%) had never tried any other
drug and the remainder had only tried
other drugs experimentally. "Pure
sample" analyses excluded all partici-
pants with histories of regular or heavy
use of alcohol or other drugs.
Neuropsychological Tests
and Procedures
Nine neuropsychological tests were
administered in the order listed in
TABLE 2,38-46 along with the 2 tests used
to assess premorbid IQ.30-32 A 10-
minuterestbreakwasgivenaftertheRey
AuditoryVerbalLearningTest(RAVLT)
Recognition test. Tests were adminis-
tered by trained assistants and took ap-
proximately 2 hours to complete. Qual-
ity assurance procedures were adopted
to ensure that procedures were stan-
dardized at each site with ongoing su-
pervision and review of audiotaped
assessmentsbycentralizedstaffthrough-
out the course of the study.
Data Analysis
Each cognitive test was analysed us-
ing SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS Institute,
Chicago, Ill) with analysis of covari-
ance (ANCOVA) for normally distrib-
uted variables or nonparametric tests
of group differences for skewed data.
The FSIQ and age were included as co-
variates in analyses where they corre-
lated with test performance. All par-
ticipants were initially included in
analysis, with the overall cannabis user
sample first compared with the con-
trol group (evaluated at P.05), fol-
lowed by comparisons on the basis of
duration of cannabis use (long- vs
shorter-term users vs controls, evalu-
ated at P.01). For 2-way interac-
tions, the Greenhouse-Geisser method
was used to adjust the df where appro-
priate and for multiple comparisons, a
Bonferroni adjustment controlled for
type I error. Analysis of covariance was
repeated on a purer sample that strictly

excluded those participants with ei-
ther a history of other drug use or pos-
sible recent use of cannabis prior to test-
ing. Semipartial correlations examined
the unique contributions of FSIQ, age,
duration of cannabis use, and recency
of cannabis use to the variance in cog-
nitive test performance.
RESULTS
Results from the 9 neuropsychologi-
cal tests are shown in TABLE 3 for can-
nabis users overall, for groups based on
duration of cannabis use, and for con-
trols. Effect sizes are calculated be-
tween long-term users and controls us-
ing the SD of the controls.
Speed of Comprehension
Cannabis user groups did not differ
from controls in the number of items
completed (range, 23-100) but users
overall made more errors (P=.03)
(range, 0-5). These results suggest that
cannabis users are more likely to sac-
rifice accuracy for speed.
Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
Mean words recalled on each trial are
depicted in the FIGURE. The learning
curves of shorter-term users and con-
trols were similar but long-term users
showed a learning curve with a less
steep gradient and long-term users re-
called fewer words on every trial. The
sum of words recalled across all trials
I through VII inclusive of trial B (re-
ferred to here as RAVLT sum; range, 37-
114) correlated significantly and in-
versely with the duration of cannabis
use after controlling for age and FSIQ
(partial r,-0.23; P=.01). When ana-
lysed by ANCOVA, there was a signifi-
cant effect of group (F2,127
= 8.36;
P.001) whereby long-term users re-
called significantly fewer words than ei-
ther shorter-term users (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] for difference, 3.84-
19.18; P=.001) or controls (95% CI for
difference, 2.83-19.93; P=.005) with no
difference between shorter-term users
and controls. When all trials were in-
cluded in a repeated measures AN-
COVA, a significant interaction be-
tween group and trial (F14,889
=2.84;
P=.007) suggested that long-term us-
ers recalled fewer words than shorter-
term users or controls on every trial
(P.05 for each comparison) except the
first, with a trend on trial B (the inter-
ferencelistpresentedonlyonce;P=.08).
The proportion of subjects with a
very poor learning ability (acquisition
3 words over 5 trials) was greater
among long-term users (13.7%) than
controls (0%) (P=.007) but not shorter-
term users (5.9%). The proportion of
long-term users recalling fewer than 10
words on trial V (27.5%) was more than
among shorter-term users (8.5%) or
controls (3.0%) (P=.002). Signifi-
cantly more long-term users (23.5%)
lost 3 or more words over the 20-
minute delay between trials VI and VII
than shorter-term users (4.3%) or con-
trols (3.0%) (P=.003). Long-term us-
ers showed a smaller primacy effect in
the serial position curve than either
other group (P=.02). Groups did not
differ in the recency effect or in words
recalled from the middle of the list.
Users overall and long-term users rec-
ognized fewer words than controls from
list A (overall, P=.03; long-term, P=.01)
and list B (overall, P=.01; long-term,
P=.04) but long-term users did not dif-
fer from shorter-term users. More than
half of the long-term users (55%) had a
recognition score for list A of 12 or less
compared with 28% of shorter-term us-
ers and 21% of controls (P=.002). Long-
termusersmisassignedmorewords(me-
dian, 2) than shorter-term users and
controls (each median, 0) (P.001). A
greater proportion of long-term users
(13.7%)comparedwithshorter-termus-
ers (6.4%) and controls (0%) actually
identified fewer words on recognition
than they had just prior during recall on
trial VII (P=.02). Long-term users' per-
formance was significantly poorer than
published norms47 for the general popu-
lation on most measures from the
RAVLT.
Stroop Test
Cannabis users did not differ signifi-
cantly from controls after inclusion of
covariates in any condition or on in-
terference scores. While there were no
performancedifferencesbetweenColor-
Word (CW) and Color-Read (CR) in
the control group, performance on CR
was, however, poorer than on CW in
both long- (P.001) and shorter-term

pleted on CR (partial r,-0.27; P=.003)
and CW (partial r,-0.27; P=.004) af-

Alphabet Task and
Omitted Numbers
Groups did not differ in the time taken
to complete any trial of the Alphabet
Task or in the number of items correct
in the Omitted Numbers task. The log
time to complete the alternating trial of
the Alphabet Task increased as a func-
tion of duration of cannabis use (par-
tial r, 0.26; P=.006), as did the square
root difference between times taken to
complete the alternating and loud tri-
als, an index of interference and lack
of flexibility (partial r, 0.26; P=.006).
Time Estimation Tasks
Cannabis users differed from controls
(P.001) in Time Estimation Task A
where they estimated the time taken to
completethepreceding(OmittedNum-
bers) task. Both long- and shorter-term
users underestimated the time by about
one third of the actual time taken (64.4
seconds)anddifferedsignificantlyfrom
controls (P=.01 and P.001, respec-
tively).Groupsdidnotdifferinthesimple
and brief warned passive Time Estima-
tion Task B or Time Production, where
they could use strategies such as count-
ing. Time estimation measures did not
correlate with duration of cannabis use.
Auditory Consonant Trigrams
Long-term users recalled significantly
fewer items than shorter-term users
(P=.007), controls (P=.002), and pub-
lishednorms48 ononlythe9-seconddelay
condition.Thenumberofitemsrecalled
did not correlate with duration of can-
nabisuse.Inthegeneralpopulation,the
greater the delay interval the worse the
performance.Incannabisusers,thisgen-
eral pattern was apparent, though there
was greater interference at the shorter-
delay interval than would be expected.
Paced Auditory Serial
Addition Test
Long-term users had slower processing
rates than shorter-term users on trial 1
(P=.007), with trends on trial 2 (P=.03)
and the total processing rate across all
trials (P=.02). Group differences on all
other measures failed to reach signifi-
cance but the performance of the long-
term users was poorer in comparison
with one set of norms49 but not an-
other.50

reduction in power to detect differ-
ences between groups, there remained
a significant difference with =.05 be-
tween long-term users and controls on
RAVLTsum (P=.03), recognition of lists
A (P=.004) and B (P=.01), and be-
tween users overall and controls on the
unwarnedTimeEstimationtask(P=.02).
Theseresultssupportthehypothesisthat
impaired memory function and time es-
timation are specific to chronic use of
cannabis.
In a separate analysis, exclusion of us-
ers whose urinary cannabinoid metabo-
lite levels exceeded those from the night
before testing by 50 ng/mg or more
(n=18) still resulted in significant dif-
ferences between long- and shorter-
termusers,andlong-termusersandcon-
trols on RAVLT sum (P=.002 and
P=.002, respectively), on recognition of
lists A (P=.005 and P=.006) and B

delay of the Auditory Consonant Tri-
grams test (P=.02 and P=.03), and us-
ersstilldifferedfromcontrolsontimees-
timation(P=.005).Whenthesamplewas
split at the median for time since last use
or level of urinary cannabinoid metabo-
lite on the day of testing and analyzed by
ANCOVA, there were no differences on
any measure between those who had
used cannabis within the past 17 hours
and those who had used cannabis 17 or
more hours ago, or those with high vs
low levels of urinary metabolites and no
interactions with duration of cannabis
use. Including measures of recent use as
covariates in ANCOVA did not change
the significance of differences between
long- and shorter-term users. These re-
sults support the hypothesis that im-
paired performance is not a conse-
quence of recent use prior to testing or
the extent of cannabinoid residues pre-
sent.
To explore further the influences of
duration of cannabis use and recency
of use, semipartial correlations were cal-
culated using the following predic-
tors: FSIQ, age, duration of cannabis
use, and hours since last use of canna-
bis. As shown in TABLE 4, the unique
contribution of duration of cannabis use
to the variance of each test variable was
superior or at least equivalent to that
of recency of use in all 6 test variables
that had significant contributions from
at least 1 cannabis use parameter. Re-
cent use contributed only to perfor-
mance on the memory tests. The fact
that a minority of the sample, primar-
ily shorter-term users, reported expe-
riencing mild withdrawal symptoms,
yet shorter-term users' performance was
not impaired, supports the interpreta-
tion of the cognitive impairments ob-
served as a long-term consequence of
cannabis use and not a manifestation
of overtly experienced withdrawal.
COMMENT
The results of this study have con-
firmed and extended previous find-
ings of cognitive impairments among
chronic heavy cannabis users. Long-
term users with a mean 24 years of regu-
lar cannabis use performed signifi-
cantly less well on tests of memory and
attention than nonuser controls and
shorter-term users with a mean of 10
years' use. The greatest impairment on
almost every measure was from the
RAVLT, indicating a generalized
memory deficit with impaired learn-
ing, retention, and retrieval. Long-
termusersrecalled2.5fewerwordsthan
controls on the delayed recall trial
where 49% of the long-term users'
scores were more than 1 SD, and 21.6%
were more than 2 SDs, below the con-
trol mean and normative data.47 A large
proportion of long-term users' recog-
nition scores were more than 1 SD
(51%) or 2 SDs (31.4%) below the con-
trol mean and norms.47 Effect sizes for
measures that differed significantly be-
tween long-term users and controls
ranged from 0.56 to 1.29 across all tests,
indicating moderate to large effects.
These results do not indicate a se-
vere memory problem but could nev-
ertheless translate into clinically sig-
nificantcognitiveimpairmentandcould
impact functioning in daily life. There
were significant differences between
long-term users and controls on 6 of the
9 tests administered and performance
on 4 tests worsened as a function of in-
creasing years of cannabis use. De-
spite this and a range of up to 17 years
of cannabis use in the shorter-term user
group, they differed significantly from
controls only on time estimation.

Altered brain metabolism in shorter-
term users may be detected with sen-
sitive techniques, such as functional
magnetic resonance imaging and posi-
tron emission tomography, but the
clinical significance of such changes re-
mains obscure. The strength of this
study is in its assessment of overtly rel-
evant cognitive processes; our results
suggest that shorter-term cannabis us-
ers are not impaired to an extent that
would interfere with cognitive func-
tioning in their daily lives. The fact that
the frequency of use was near daily
among long- and shorter-term users
suggests that the duration of cannabis
use is a more salient contributor to the
development of cognitive impairment
than quantity or frequency of use.
While most cannabis users cease us-
ing in their mid-20s to late 20s, approxi-
mately 20% continue to use through
their 30s and beyond.2 This is the first
study to our knowledge of a relatively
large sample of long-term entrenched
cannabis users seeking treatment. Con-
cern about perceived cognitive impair-
ment was one of many problems asso-
ciated with cannabis use that led the
users in this study to seek treatment.
This concern is unlikely to have biased
the results of this study since a slightly
higher proportion of shorter-term vs
long-term users reported experiencing
cognitive problems, yet shorter-term us-
ers mostly did not differ from controls
on the cognitive tests. Nevertheless, it
is possible that long-term cannabis us-
ers in the community who are not seek-
ing treatment may not experience im-
pairments to the same degree as those
assessed in this study.
While acknowledging the limita-
tions of retrospective designs, if care-
fully controlled and analyzed, this ap-
proach is the most efficient way to
evaluate the long-term cognitive ef-
fects of cannabis, given the costs and lo-
gistical difficulties in using prospective
research designs. The matching of
groups on measures of premorbid in-
tellectual functioning that are resilient
to brain damage, together with the ob-
served relationships between duration
of cannabis use and test performance,
support the assumption that the cogni-
tive impairments observed in the long-
term users were not preexisting but de-
velopedasaresultoftheirprolongeduse
of cannabis. Impairment appeared un-
related to withdrawal phenomena. The
cognitivefunctionsassessedinthisstudy
are dependent on the intact function-
ing of the hippocampus, prefrontal cor-
tex, and cerebellum,39,51-55 which are
densewithcannabinoidreceptors.56 The
effects that exogenous cannabinoids ex-
ert on the cannabinoid receptor system
and the role of endogenous cannabi-
noids as suggested by animal re-
search6,21-24 provide a credible neuro-
physiological explanation for the
development of cognitive impairments
as the result of hypothesized long-term
changes occurring over many years of
exposure to the drug.
In conclusion, our results confirm
that cognitive impairments develop as
a result of prolonged cannabis use, they
endure beyond the period of acute in-
toxication, and they worsen with in-
creasing years of use. Impairments de-
velop gradually but may only become
clinically significant and detectable by
standard neuropsychological tests af-
ter 1 to 2 decades of cannabis use. Nev-
ertheless, altered brain function with
subtle impairment has been shown to
manifest earlier.6,8,9,11,17,18 It is also likely
that impairments would be greater
among comorbid substance-depen-
dent persons. The risk to most medi-
cal cannabis users is likely to be small,
as long as they are not maintained at
high doses for many years. For ha-
bitual users, the kinds of impairments
observed in this study have the poten-
tial to impact academic achievements,
occupational proficiency, interper-
sonal relationships, and daily function-
ing. The extent to which these cogni-
tive impairments may recover following
cessation or reduction of cannabis use
will be addressed in a follow-up of this
sample subsequent to treatment for can-
nabis dependence.

elitis (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.2-5.7).
Comment. Although it has long been hypothesized that po-
liomyelitis is associated with an increased risk of PD,4 to our
knowledge this has never been empirically demonstrated. The
observed increased PD risk does not necessarily imply that po-
liovirus is directly implicated in PD pathogenesis. Rather, we
speculate that by reducing the number of neurons essential to
normal neuronal functions, the virally induced damage may
enhance the effect of normal age-related neuronal degenera-
tion and thus precipitate PD.1,4
We acknowledge possible limitations of our data. Because
patients with poliomyelitis may be admitted to hospitals or may
attend outpatient clinics more often than other persons, de-
tection bias could arise. However, in Denmark, the diagnosis,
evaluation, and treatment of PD normally take place at neu-
rological departments or neurological outpatient clinics. More-
over, although patients with PD initially may consult private
neurologists or general practitioners, the vast majority of pa-
tients with PD will at some point undergo clinical evaluation
or hospitalization at specialized hospital departments because
of the complexity of the disease. Therefore, we think that most
Danish patients with PD would be registered in the NHDR, and
we consider detection bias to be an unlikely explanation for
our findings.
Patients with polio may present a wide range of neurologi-
cal symptoms, which could cause diagnostic ambiguity. If di-
agnostic misclassification would explain our observations we
would have expected the risk of PD to be particularly in-
creased in patients with paralytic polio. However, an in-
creased risk of PD was also observed in patients with nonpara-
lytic polio. Moreover, the likely inclusion of patients with
nonpolio virus-related meningitis in the group of patients with
primary lymphocytic meningitis may indicate that the ob-
served PD risk is not particular to the poliovirus but also ap-
plies to other viruses infecting the central nervous system.
