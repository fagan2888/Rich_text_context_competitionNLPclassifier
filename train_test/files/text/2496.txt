Correlates of Sexual Activity and Satisfaction in Midlife
and Older Women
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Sexual activity is an important component of quality of life for women
across their lifespan. Prior studies show a decline in sexual activity with age, but
these studies often fail to consider the role of sexual satisfaction. The aim of this
study is to give updated prevalence estimates of sexual activity among women
and to elucidate factors associated with sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.
METHODS We report a cross-sectional analysis of the second wave of a nationally
representative sample of US adults aged 28 to 84 years, the Survey of Midlife
Development in the United States. The survey used self-administered question-
naires to assess demographic data, self-rated physical and mental health, medi-
cal problems and medication use, relationship factors, and sexual activity and
satisfaction.
RESULTS Of 2,116 women who answered the questions regarding sexuality, 1,345
(61.8%) women were sexually active in the previous 6 months. The proportion
of women who were sexually active decreased with advancing age. Women who
were married or cohabitating had approximately 8 times higher odds of being
sexually active (odds ratio
=
7.91, 95% CI, 4.16-15.04; P <.001). Among women
aged 60 years and older who were married or cohabitating, most (59.0%) were
sexually active. Among women who were sexually active, higher relationship satis-
faction (P <.001), better communication (P
=
.011), and higher importance of sex
P
=
.040) were related to higher sexual satisfaction, but age was not (P=.79).
CONCLUSIONS A considerable proportion of midlife and older women remain
sexually active if they have a partner available. Psychosocial factors (relationship
satisfaction, communication with romantic partner, and importance of sex) mat-
ter more to sexual satisfaction than aging among midlife and older women.

INTRODUCTION
The US population is aging. By 2030, there will be about 72.1 million
individuals aged 65 years and older in the United States, represent-
ing 19% of the population.1 In 2011 the first baby boomers turned 65
years old. As this unique population moves through midlife and into older
age, there is an increased interest in how sexuality changes with aging.
There is a strong link between a healthy sex life and higher quality of
life as individuals age.2-7 Prior studies on the relationship between sexu-
ality and aging in women have shown a decrease in sexual activity and
sexual function with time.5,8-13 These studies, however, have limitations:
(1) small sample sizes; (2) a focus only frequency of sexual activity and
include no information on sexual satisfaction, despite sexual satisfaction
also being important to women14,15; and (3) the use of clinical practice­
based samples, which may include more women with sexual function com-
plaints or medical problems than the general population.
In this study, we used the second wave of a nationally representative
sample (the Study of Midlife Development in the United States, MIDUS
II) of women aged 28 to 84 years to examine the prevalence of sexual
activity by age. We identified the correlates of both sexual activity and

sexual satisfaction, as well as the relationship between
sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.
METHODS
Population
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data
from MIDUS II (2004-2006). The first wave of MIDUS
included a random-digit dialing sample of 7,108 indi-
viduals in the mainland United States. For each house-
hold contacted, 1 respondent between the ages of 25
and 74 years was randomly selected. Older people and
men were oversampled. Non­English-speaking and
institutionalized individuals were excluded. Of the
7,108 adults in the first wave, 4,963 were successfully
interviewed in MIDUS II (mortality-adjusted response
rate 75%).16 Only women were included in the current
analysis. All participants provided informed consent,
and the Institutional Review Board at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison approved the study.
Measures
Participants completed a telephone interview and self-
administered questionnaires regarding demographics,
physical and mental health, and sexuality. Women were
asked how many sexual partners they had in the previ-
ous 12 months. If they answered any number greater
than 0, they were asked, "Over the past 6 months, on
average, how often have you had sex with someone?"
A specific definition of sex was not given in the survey,
and so interpretation was up to the individual. Individu-
als who answered never or not at all were considered
sexually inactive; all others were considered sexually
active, unless they did not answer the question.
Sexual satisfaction was assessed by the question,
"How would you rate the sexual aspect of your life
these days?" Responses were rated using a scale of 0 to
10, where 0=worst to 10=best. Prior sexual satisfac-
tion was assessed by the question, "Looking back 10
years ago, how would you rate the sexual aspect of
your life at that time?" using the same 0-to-10 scale.
Importance of sex was assessed by the question, "To
what extent would you say that sexual expression is an
important part of your relationships?" Responses were
rated using a Likert scale ranging from a lot to some to
a little to not at all. Women who were married or living
with someone in a marriage-like relationship were con-
sidered romantically partnered. Menopausal status was
assigned based on self-reported bleeding status using
a modification of the Stages of Reproductive Aging
Workshop classification.17 Women who had a hysterec-
tomy but still had 1 or 2 ovaries and women who had
bilateral oophorectomy were considered as separate
groups. Medication use and pain with intercourse in
the prior 30 days was evaluated by self-report. Depres-
sion status was assessed using a validated self-report
scale based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th Revision diagnosis of depression.18,19
Communication was evaluated by the question, "How
much can you open up to your spouse or partner if you
need to talk about your worries?" with a 4-point Likert
scale ranging from a lot to not at all.
Statistical Analyses
Means, medians, standard deviations, and percentages,
as appropriate, were used to describe sexually inactive
and sexually active women. Poststratification weights
based on race, age, and education status provided by
the MIDUS II study group20 were used to present
means and percentages for the general population.
Because no sampling was conducted for the second
wave follow-up study, only population-based adjust-
ment weights were created for MIDUS II. Sexual
activity was considered as a dichotomous variable (any/
none). The sexual satisfaction variable was divided into
3 levels (0-3, 4-7, 8-10). Univariate logistic regression
was used to examine factors that may be related to
sexual activity based on published literature. Factors
related to the outcome at P <.10 were entered into a
multivariate model. Romantic partner factors, such as
partner age and health status, were highly collinear
with whether the respondent was married or cohabitat-
ing and were not included in the multivariate model
of sexual activity. Univariate ordinal logistic regres-
sion was used to examine factors that may be related
to sexual satisfaction. Factors related to the outcome
at P <0.10 were entered into a multivariate model.
The final model met the proportional odds assump-
tion. Analyses of sexual satisfaction were restricted to
women who were sexually active in the prior 6 months.
Sampling weights were not significantly related to
either sexual activity or sexual satisfaction and were
not used in the regression models. All statistical analy-
ses were conducted with StataSE 13.0 (StataCorp).
RESULTS
Demographics
Of 2,647 women in MIDUS II, more than one-half,
1,475 (55.7%), reported having at least 1 sexual partner
in the past year, 641 (25.2%) had no sexual partner in
the past year, 116 (4.4%) refused to answer the ques-
tion, and 408 (15.4%) had missing data. Women who
refused to answer the question were older (P <.001),
more likely to be postmenopausal (P=.005), less likely
to be romantically partnered (P <.001), and had lower
income (P <.001), lower education status (P <.001),
and poorer health (P=.023) than those who answered.

Women for whom data were missing were younger
(P <.001), more likely to be racial minorities (P <.001),
and had poorer physical (P=.003) and mental health
(P=.007) than those who responded.
Of 1,799 romantically partnered women in MIDUS
II, 1,202 were sexually active. Of 804 women who
were not romantically partnered, 135 were sexually
active. Of all women who responded to the questions
regarding sex, 1,345 (61.8%) were sexually active (Fig-
ure 1). Characteristics of sexually inactive and active
women are summarized in Table 1. The mean ages of
sexually inactive women and sexually active women
were 62.0 years (SD=11.8 years) and 51.8 years
(SD=10.9 years), respectively. Most respondents were
white, and approximately one-half the sample either
naturally or surgically postmenopausal.
The proportion of women who were sexually active
decreased with older age (Table 2). Most (61.2%)
romantically partnered women were sexually active,
including 59.0% of women aged 60 years and older.
Frequency of sexual activity differed by age, with older
women reporting less frequent sexual activity than
younger women (Figure 2). Overall, 51.9% of the sexu-
ally active women had sex at least once a week, and
84.7% had sex at least once a month.
Factors Associated With Sexual Activity
In multivariate models, women who were married or
cohabitating had approximately 8 times the odds of
being sexually active (odds ration [OR]=7.91, 95%
CI, 4.16-15.04; P <.001), Table 3. Importance of sex
was also strongly related to sexual activity (P <.001);
women who rated sex as more important were more
likely to be sexually active. Other factors associated
with being sexually active were lack of depression,
higher prior sexual satisfaction, younger age, and lower
body mass index.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis for missing
data regarding sexual activity. We repeated the analy-
sis assuming all women who had missing data regard-
ing sexual activity were sexually active, and then
repeated the analysis assuming all women who had
missing data regarding sexual activity were not sexu-
ally active. Results, including which variables were
significant at the P <.05 level, were similar to those of
the primary analysis.
Factors Associated With Sexual Satisfaction
Mean sexual satisfaction was much higher among
sexually active women than among sexually inactive
women (Figure 1). Weighted mean satisfaction for
sexually active and inactive women (including women
both with and without romantic partners) was 6.2 vs
2.3, respectively. Factors associated with higher sexual
satisfaction among sexually active women in the multi-
variate model included higher relationship satisfaction,
better communication, higher ratings of the impor-
tance of sex, more frequent sex, higher prior sexual

women, we found that the proportion of
women who were sexually active in the
previous 6 months decreased with age. If
they were romantically partnered, how-

ing 59.0% of women aged 60 years and
older. Romantic partner status was the
factor most strongly related to whether
a woman was sexually active or not.
Among the women who were sexually
active, psychosocial factors (such as
relationship satisfaction, communica-
tion with her romantic partner, and
importance of sex) were significantly
related to sexual satisfaction, whereas
age and menopausal status were not.
Our estimates regarding preva-
lence of sexual activity in midlife and
older women are similar to reported
estimates, which range from 53% to
79% depending on the population
studied.11,21,22 Among women who were
romantically partnered, the prevalence
of sexual activity was high, even for
women in their 70s and 80s. Prior stud-
ies have suggested that lack of a roman-
tic partner is one of the most common
reasons sexual inactivity in this popu-
lation.8,23,24 Our study reinforced this
relationship. As women move through
midlife and older age, they may lose
romantic partners to death, divorce, or
separation, and become sexually inac-
tive. Some women, however, may still
participate in sexual activity outside
a cohabitating romantic relationship;
about 13% of sexually active women
in MIDUS II were not married or
cohabitating.
Loss of a partner is only one rea-
son why women may be less likely to
engage in sexual activity as they age.
Advancing age may bring new health
concerns in the woman or her partner,
or menopausal changes, such as vaginal
dryness, could affect sexual activity. In
this analysis, the relationship between
increasing age and decreasing sexual
activity persisted, even when control-
ling for these factors and others. One
reason may be a birth cohort effect--
attitudes towards female sexuality have
become more progressive during the
past 5 decades,25 and women born in
later decades may be more likely to
participate in sexual activity at every
age or more likely to report being sexu-
ally active on a survey. Longitudinal
studies using a broad age range of

women are necessary to untangle the effects of birth
cohort from aging.
Our findings suggest that those women who do
remain sexually active with age are able to maintain
sexual satisfaction through the years despite the
changes of menopause and aging. Women may adapt
to these physical changes by changing their sexual
behavior. For example, women who develop vaginal
dryness may incorporate types of sexual activity
other than penile-vaginal intercourse or incorporate
therapeutic aids, such as lubricants. Women may also
place more emphasis on other aspects of sex, such as
emotional closeness, and less emphasis on physical
sensations.26,27 These recalibrations in expectations sur-
rounding sex may allow older women to feel sexually
satisfied even if their sex lives are different from those
of their younger years.
In contrast to age, psychosocial factors (relation-
ship satisfaction, quality of communica-
tion with one's romantic partner, and
importance of sex) are highly related to
sexual satisfaction. Prior studies have
also shown a close connection between
relationship satisfaction and sexual sat-
isfaction,6,23,28-34 but few studies have
examined communication in particu-
lar.30,35 We find here that good commu-
nication between romantic partners in
general, not just in relation to sex, was
associated with higher sexual satisfaction.
Sexual satisfaction was lower among
women who were not sexually active in
the previous 6 months. It may be that
these women would prefer to be active
but lack a partner or have other interfer-
ing factors. It is also possible that low
sexual satisfaction led to sexual inactiv-
ity, or that sexually inactive women are
unsure how to respond to the question
and mark "0" even if they are not sexually
dissatisfied.
Our study has several limitations. This
study is cross-sectional, so causality can-
not be determined. Second, a validated
measure of sexual satisfaction was not
used. Third, MIDUS II had limited num-
bers of racial, ethnic, and sexual minori-
ties. Finally, about 20% women did not
respond to the questions regarding sexual
activity, which may result in bias.
Health care professionals should be
aware that many women maintain or
want to maintain a satisfying sex life into
middle age and beyond. Clinicians should
ask women about sexual activity and
sexual satisfaction and work with women
to develop strategies to maintain a satisfy-
ing sex life with aging, including ways to
improve relationship satisfaction and com-
munication, such as relationship therapy.
