Dimensions of Women's Mate Preferences:
Validation of a Mate Preference Scale in Iran
Mohammad Atari1 and Ramin Jamali2
Abstract
A large number of studies have assessed human mate preferences using lists of characteristics. To date, there is little data
regarding mate preferences in Iran. The present study aimed to investigate dimensions in mate preferences among Iranian women
and to validate a female-specific instrument in Iranian context. Three studies were designed and conducted. The first study was an
interview-based qualitative analysis of women's mate preferences. The second study provided a psychometrically sound list of 26
characteristics in a potential mate. The third study confirmed the five-factor structure of the instrument. In sum, five dimensions
of mate preferences among Iranian women are kindness/dependability, status/resources, attractiveness/sexuality, religiosity/
chastity, and education/intelligence, as measured by the newly developed 26-item scale.

In past few decades, a large number of empirical studies have
investigated the characteristics that humans prefer in a potential
mate (Buss, 1998; Candolin, 2003; Eastwick, Luchies, Finkel, &
Hunt, 2014; Okami & Shackelford, 2001; Shackelford, Schmitt,
& Buss, 2005). There are several differences in long- and short-
term relationships (Li & Kenrick, 2006) as well as gender dif-
ferences. Buss (1985) noted two major gender differences
regarding mate preferences, indicating that women are more
concerned with a potential partner's earning ability while men
are more interested in physical characteristics, such as potential
partner's attractiveness and cues for fertility. Therefore, it is
crucial to consider gender differences in examining human mate
preferences (Buss, 1989), which have been confirmed across
different cultures and methodologies (Buss et al., 1990; Buss,
Shackelford, Kirkpatrick, & Larsen, 2001; Li, Valentine, &
Patel, 2011; McGinnis, 1958; Wiederman & Allgeier, 1992).
Moreover, there are a number of female-specific variables that
can alter mate preferences (cf., Frederick, Reynolds, & Fisher,
2013). For example, it has been shown that mate preferences
may vary according to menstrual cycle (Gangestad, Garver-
Apgar, & Simpson, 2007; Pillsworth, Haselton, & Buss, 2004).
There are also some similarities between genders regarding mate
preferences. For instance, both women and men value charac-
teristics such as ``good disposition,'' ``emotional stability,'' and
``kind and understanding'' (Buss, 1989).
Mate preferences among females vary by culture (Buss,
1989). Yet, a number of studies have suggested the most impor-
tant factors in a potential mate for a female. Furnham (2009)
asked young people to rate 14 desirable factors under five
broader categories (ability, personality, physical, social, and
values). Females rated intelligence, stability, conscientious-
ness, height, education, social skills, political compatibility,
and religious similarity significantly higher than males. A
study in India also suggested that characteristics such as
healthy, kind and understanding, intelligent, and good earning
capacity were among the most important factors in choosing a
mate (Kamble, Shackelford, Pham, & Buss, 2014). Moreover,
the role of height has attracted a great deal of attention from
researchers (Frederick & Jenkins, 2015; Mueller & Mazur,
2001; Salska et al., 2008; Sear, 2006; Stulp, Buunk, & Pollet,
2013; Stulp, Pollet, Verhulst, & Buunk, 2012). More recent

studies have also highlighted the role of age, social class,
ethnicity (Furnham & McClelland, 2015), and intelligence
(Prokosch, Coss, Scheib, & Blozis, 2009) in females' mate
preferences.
Most of the existing literature on human mate preferences
relies on questionnaire-based surveys of participants who value
a certain characteristic to a certain extent. The number and
quality of characteristics vary across different studies (Shack-
elford et al., 2005). The most widely used mate preference
listing includes 18 characteristics, first used in 1930s by Hill
(1945). Over the past seven decades, this list has been used in
many seminal studies (e.g., Buss, 1989). Other studies have
also used different lists of mate preferences with different num-
ber of items (Buss & Barnes, 1986; Furnham, 2009; Goodwin
& Tang, 1991; Simpson & Gangestad, 1992).
A considerable number of studies that aimed to identify
the dimensions of mate preferences are methodologically
different regarding the content of items, number of items,
size of samples, and demographic details of samples. Yet, a
number of dimensions have uniformly been identified in the
literature. For example, dimensions of ``social status and
financial resources'' (e.g., Buss & Barnes, 1986; Fletcher,
Simpson, Thomas, & Giles, 1999; Furnham & McClelland,
2015; Parmer, 1998; Regan, Levin, Sprecher, Christopher, &
Cate, 2000), ``kindness and warmth'' (e.g., Buss & Barnes,
1986; Fletcher et al., 1999; Goodwin & Tang, 1991; Regan
et al., 2000), ``attractiveness and health'' (e.g., Fletcher et al.,
1999; Parmer, 1998; Simpson & Gangestad, 1992), and ``reli-
giosity'' (e.g., Buss & Barnes, 1986; Furnham, 2009; Shack-
elford et al., 2005) have been previously identified.
A number of studies have used factor analytic techniques to
identify the underlying dimensions of mate preferences. Good-
win and Tang (1991) subjected 15 characteristics to a factor
analysis and found three dimensions, that is, kindness/consid-
eration, extroversion, and sensitivity. Another factor analysis
on ratings of 15 characteristics identified two dimensions of
mate preference, that is, personal/parenting qualities and attrac-
tiveness/social visibility (Simpson & Gangestad, 1992).
Fletcher, Simpson, Thomas, and Giles (1999) submitted 75
characteristics to factor analyses and reported three major
dimensions (warmth-trustworthiness, vitality-attractiveness,
and status-resources). Furthermore, Buss and Barnes (1986)
found nine dimensions of mate preference (kind-considerate,
socially exciting, artistic-intelligent, religious, domestic, pro-
fessional status, likes children, politically conservative, and
easygoing-adaptable). More recently, a factor analytic study
reported 12 dimensions of mate selection preferences (kind and
understanding, dominant, pleasant, intellectual, wealthy and
generous, physically attractive, cultivated, humorous, sociable,
creative and domestic, reliable, and similar) using a list of
82 characteristics (Schwarz & Hassebrauck, 2012). Buss and
Shackelford (2008) reported four clusters of characteristics in a
potential male (good gene indicators, good investment ability
indicators, good parenting indicators, and good partner indica-
tors) and argued that more attractive women desire all these
indicators in potential mate.
Using a large archival database, Shackelford et al. (2005)
submitted 18 previously mentioned characteristics to a princi-
pal components analysis and identified four cross-culturally
universal dimensions (love vs. status/resources, dependable/
stable vs. good looks/health, education/intelligence vs. desire
for home/children, and sociability vs. similar religion) that
explained 35% of the total variance. Trade-off model (Gang-
estad & Simpson, 2000) was used to explain the grouping of
items into components. These authors also recommended con-
ducting within-culture analyses to identify specific dimensions
and constituent preferences that best capture the preference
ratings for that particular culture. Of note, data from Iran were
excluded from this investigation due to small sample size.
The present research aimed to investigate dimensions of
long-term mate preference among Iranian females through
three studies. This research would be important considering the
following: (a) Iran has been excluded from large-scale cross-
cultural studies investigating mate preferences (e.g., Schmitt,
2004a; Shackelford et al., 2005), (b) little data based on empiri-
cal investigations is available from Iran, (c) very small sample
sizes have been drawn from Iran in large-scale international
studies (e.g., Buss et al., 1990), and (d) to date, there is no
standardized measure for assessment of Iranian females' mate
preferences.
Study 1
This qualitative study aimed to prepare a preliminary list of
characteristics in mate preferences among Iranian women. We
used individualized sessions to provide a list to be subjected to
quantitative analyses.
Material and Method
Forty-seven heterosexual women aged between 19 and
31 years (M ¼ 24.5, SD ¼ 3.5) were recruited using conve-
nience sampling method. Twenty-one of the participants were
selected randomly in a premarriage consulting clinic. These
women were about to get married in near future. A total of
19 participants were recruited in university settings. Seven
participants were selected in work settings from the popula-
tion of working women. All participants were asked about
their socioeconomic status on a 5-point scale ranging from
1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Eleven women rated 5, 15
participants rated 4, 14 participants rated 3, 6 participants
rated 2, and 1 participant rated 1.
Two interviewers were involved: one woman and one man.
Characteristics of a potential long-term mate were discussed in
10-min individualized sessions. First, an overview of long-term
relationship was presented by the interviewer; then, partici-
pants were asked about their preferences in choosing a long-
term mate. Each participant reported between 10 and
20 desirable characteristics. Qualitative information were
coded and analyzed following a standard procedure (Boyatzis,
1998; Bryman, 2006). First, meaning units were extracted from
interviews. Meaning units are constellation of words or
2 Evolutionary Psychology
statements that relate to the same central meaning (e.g., ``I
definitely want my future long-term partner to be honest because
lying makes me sick''). Then, meaning units were analyzed to
form condensed meaning unit (e.g., ``wanting an honest partner
who doesn't lie''). Finally, condensed meaning units were coded
as single characteristics (e.g., ``honest and truthful'').
Results
A total of 205 characteristics were acquired. Fetish-like
responses related to specific body parts were excluded. For
example, one participant said: ``I wouldn't possibly think about
a guy, unless he has a six pack.'' Of course, many women are
attracted to muscular men (Frederick & Haselton, 2007; Gray
& Frederick, 2012), but this item represented an extreme
answer. Repeated characteristics (e.g., ``kind'' was present in
42 interviews) were also excluded and a final pool of 45
characteristics was formed, 37 of which were present in the
literature (e.g., Buss & Barnes, 1986; Furnham, 2009; Hill,
1945; Li, Bailey, Kenrick, & Linsenmeier, 2002). Therefore,
considering the aforementioned literature, and domestic stud-
ies (e.g., Khoei, Ziaei, Salehi, & Farajzadegan, 2013), an item
pool of 39 characteristics (see Table 1) was prepared to be
used in Study 2.

aThis adjective was drawn from our qualitative analyses. To our knowledge, there is no precise translation of this word into English. Therefore, we decided to
present a definition in parentheses. In meaning, this characteristic may be considered associated with ``jealousy,'' ``honor,'' ``confrontativeness,'' ``intrasexual
rivalry,'' and ``protectiveness''; however, neither of these translations conceptually capture the meaning of ``Qeirati'' in Persian language (This paragraph was
reviewed and confirmed by two professionals in translation).

Study 2
This quantitative study aimed to finalize the scale by conduct-
ing an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on previously pre-
pared items. Additionally, we secured evidence for the
convergent validity of the scale. The internal consistency coef-
ficients (Cronbach's a) of the subscales of the measure were
also examined.
Material and Method
Participants
Initially, 350 participants completed the survey. Excluding par-
ticipants with 15% of missing values (n ¼ 34) and married
participants (n ¼ 16), a total of 300 participants was used in
this study. We recruited convenience samples from various
locations (university settings, National Library of Iran, a hos-
pital, a school, a company, and a gym) and systematically
recruited groups of single bachelor of arts/bachelor of science
(BA/BS) students, single master of arts/master of science
(MA/MS) students, single doctor of philosophy/doctor of med-
icine (PhD/MD) students, and nonstudent working women to
ensure a diverse sample of women. The sample size was suf-
ficient for factor analytic purposes (Henson & Roberts, 2006).
The data were gathered from Tehran, Iran. Generally, Tehran
may be considered the cultural and political center of Iran with
over 14 million residents.
Age of participants ranged between 15 and 47 with mean of
25.97 years (SD ¼ 5.34). Forty participants had high school
diploma, 16 had associate's degree, 83 had BS/BA, 113 had
MS/MA, 43 had PhD/MD, and 5 participants did not report
their educational level. Minimum desired age for marriage was
26.45 (SD ¼ 3.14) and maximum desired age for marriage was
27.48 (SD ¼ 3.39). Moreover, the minimum preferred age
difference (with partner) was 4.09 (SD ¼ 2.58) and maximum
preferred age difference was 4.92 (SD ¼ 2.66). In the present
sample of women, the desired number of children was 1.86 (SD
¼ 1.03).
Measures
Demographics. A set of demographic questions was developed
for this study. Demographic details included age, educational
background, ideal age difference with partner (minimum and
maximum), ideal age of marriage (minimum and maximum),
desired number of children, weight, and height. The latter two
were used to compute body mass index (BMI).
Item pool. The prepared item pool of 39 characteristics was
administered on the sample. In this survey, participants were
asked to rate the importance of each item on a 4-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 1 (unimportant) to 4 (very important).
Preferences concerning potential mates questionnaire (PPMQ). This
ranking instrument includes 13 characteristics in a potential
mate (Buss & Barnes, 1986). Participants were requested to
rank each characteristic from 1 to 13. The most desirable char-
acteristic is ranked as 1 while the least desirable is ranked as 13.
Procedure
Participants were administered the questionnaire in public
places of universities and National Library of Iran after being
informed of the voluntary nature of participation. Participants
were not remunerated.
Statistical Analysis
In order to identify the underlying dimensions of mate prefer-
ence among Iranian females, descriptive statistics for each item
were first computed. Then, a preliminary EFA was carried out.
Considering descriptive indices, items' content, and the pre-
liminary EFA, appropriate items were subjected to a principal-
axis EFA with varimax rotation. Parallel analysis was per-
formed to determine the number of factors. Moreover, Pearson
correlation coefficients were used. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS 22.
Results
The final 39-item list of long-term mate preferences, their
sources, and their descriptive statistics are presented in Table
1. Item 1 (i.e., good cook and housekeeper) had the lowest mean
and was considered the least important characteristic in choosing
a mate in the present sample. On the other hand, Item 27 (i.e.,
loyal) was the most important characteristic in a potential mate.
A preliminary EFA was conducted and highly cross-loading
items were subsequently identified. Considering the theoretical
background of items' content and exclusion of psychometri-
cally problematic items, a battery of 26 items was selected to be
subjected to EFA. Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) measure of
sampling adequacy was very high (KMO ¼ 0.858). Moreover,
Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant, w2(325) ¼ 3,201.76,
p < .001. These findings suggested that the 26 items had suf-
ficient common variance to be subjected to EFA (Worthington
& Whittaker, 2006). Six factors had eigenvalues of 1 or higher.
Yet, in order to determine the number of factors, parallel anal-
ysis was used. Parallel analysis has proved to be an accurate
way of determining the number of factors (Patil, McPherson, &
Friesner, 2010) compared to other methods, such as retaining
factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 (Guttman, 1954) or the
scree plot (Cattell, 1966). Using 1,000 random data sets, par-
allel analysis suggested extraction of five factors. Therefore, a
principal axis factoring with fixed number of five factors and
varimax rotation was performed. These five factors explained
58.17% of the total variance (25.58, 13.12, 7.60, 6.58, and
5.29%, respectively). The rotated factor matrix for 26 items
of the scale is presented in Table 2.
All factors had conceptually consistent items. Factors were,
respectively, labeled as ``kindness/dependability,'' ``status/
resources,'' ``attractiveness/sexuality,'' ``religiosity/chastity,''
and ``education/intelligence.'' The correlation coefficients
4 Evolutionary Psychology
between the five subscales are presented in Table 3. All sub-
scales were moderately correlated. Except for the correlation
coefficient between Factor 2 (status/resources) and Factor 3
(attractiveness/sexuality), all subscales were correlated with
an approximate effect size of 0.2 to 0.3. Moreover, all subscales
were internally consistent (see Table 3).
The correlation coefficients between the five factors and
demographic details are presented in Table 4. Furthermore, Pear-
son correlation coefficients were calculated between the five
subscales and 13 items of the PPMQ. Since the PPMQ is a
ranking instrument, it was hypothesized that related subscales
and items would be significantly negatively correlated (see
Table 5). The mean rank of each characteristic is also summar-
ized in Table 5. The characteristic ``kind and understanding'' had
the lowest mean rank (i.e., the most important characteristic),
and ``good housekeeper'' was the least important characteristic.

Study 3
In the present study, we used confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) to examine the factor structure of the scale as identified
in Study 2. We expected the previous structure (see Table 2) to
have acceptable fit indices in a distinct sample.
Material and Method
The final 26-item version of the scale was completed by
100 unmarried female participants aged 18­47 years
(M ¼ 27.79, SD ¼ 5.87). The BMI ranged between 17.63 and
33.46. Moreover, the desired number of children was 1.71
(SD ¼ 0.94). The minimum desired age for marriage was 24.47
(SD ¼ 3.55) while the maximum was 31.49 (SD ¼ 5.22). The
participants were recruited using snowball sampling. Gener-
ally, snowball sampling method is a nonprobability sampling
strategy in which one or more individuals are recruited and then
they recruit one or more individuals, and so on. It has been
shown to be an effective sampling strategy to access hidden
groups of participants scattered sparsely in large populations.
In this study, four individuals (three men and one woman)
were assigned and instructed to survey 25 women. Fundamen-
tally, CFA is used to determine whether an instrument's factor
structure derived from exploratory factor analytic approaches
can hold up with another respondent sample (Mvududu & Sink,
2013). We used CFA to examine the previously identified fac-
tor structure of the scale (see Table 2). All factors were per-
mitted to co-vary. As fit indices for the CFA, the w2 over degree
of freedom (w2/df), the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), the root mean square residual (RMR), the Tucker­
Lewis Index (TLI), and the comparative fit index (CFI) were
analyzed (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Maximum likelihood was used
as the estimation method. The analysis was performed using
AMOS 19.
Results
The five-factor model fits the data fairly well (w2/df ¼ 1.41;
RMSEA ¼ 0.064, RMR ¼ 0.072, TLI ¼ 0.912, CFI ¼ 0.926).
There is no complete agreement regarding interpretation of fit
indices (Mvududu & Sink, 2013), but using relatively conser-
vative criteria (four or lower for w2/df, 0.90 or higher for CFI
and TLI; lower than 0.10 for RMR and lower than 0.08 for the
RMSEA), all current indices fell within acceptable range. It has
been reported that RMSEA may over-reject good models at
small sample sizes. As a result, this is less preferable when
analyses are performed on small sample sizes; however, the
RMSEA was acceptable in the present sample. Of note, in this
sample, Cronbach's a coefficients were .91, .85, .89, .70, and
.79 for ``Kindness/Dependability,'' ``Status/Resources,''
``Attractiveness/Sexuality,'' ``Religiosity/Chastity,'' and
``Education/Intelligence'' subscales, respectively. The correla-
tion matrix between subscales also suggested that subscales
were relatively independent (rmean
¼ .19).
General Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the dimensions
of long-term mate preferences among Iranian women. Follow-
ing a qualitative study and a comprehensive literature review,
an item pool of 39 items was prepared and quantitatively tested.
A 26-item scale had the most interpretable factor structure.
Finally, a CFA on a different sample of participants provided
robust psychometric characteristics for the scale. Since gender
differences play a significant role in mate preferences, an all-
female sample was used in this study in order to investigate the
dimensions of long-term mate preferences among Iranian
women. Developing such female-specific lists of characteris-
tics can help intrasexual research on mate preferences in future.
Five dimensions of mate preferences emerged in this study.
The first factor, ``kindness/dependability,'' is conceptually
similar to dimensions of ``kindness, warmth'' and ``sociability''
as previously identified in previous studies (Buss & Barnes,
1986; Fletcher et al., 1999; Regan et al., 2000; Shackelford
et al., 2005). The second factor, ``status/resources,'' is concep-
tually similar to dimensions of ``status/resources'' and ``social
status, financial resources'' (Buss & Barnes, 1986; Kenrick,
Sadalla, Groth, & Trost, 1990; Parmer, 1998; Regan et al.,
2000; Shackelford et al., 2005). The third factor, ``attractive-
ness/sexuality,'' conceptually resembles the dimensions of
``good looks'' and ``attractiveness'' identified in previous work
(Fletcher et al., 1999; Shackelford et al., 2005; Simpson &
Gangestad, 1992). The fourth factor, ``religiosity/chastity,'' is
very similar to ``religious'' component of mate preference in
Buss and Barnes' study (1986). The fifth factor, ``education/
intelligence,'' is very similar to ``education/intelligence'' pole
in work of Shackelford and colleagues (2005). While the cor-
relation coefficients between these factors were moderate in
Study 2; Study 3 suggested that these five factors are relatively
independent. Therefore, it may be concluded that these factors
are tapping relatively independent robust dimensions of mate
preference among Iranian women.
Study 1 revealed a number of culture-related characteristics
that were previously underrecognized (i.e., having housing,
intellectual, honest, and truthful; having a good financial status,
high self-confidence, tall, similar cultural background; and
having a high income level and supportive) or unrecognized
(i.e., Qeirati). ``Having housing'' is obviously an indicator of
financial resources and a recent qualitative analysis found it to
be important in Chinese culture (Zhang, Teng, Chan, & Zhang,
2014). ``Intellectual'' has also been reported in previous
research (Schwarz & Hassebrauck, 2012). ``Honesty and truth-
fulness'' and ``supportive'' are indicators of good personality
and are preferred by most women. This preference may be
explained by the fact that negative personality characteristics
increase the possibility of future infidelity in a potential mate
(Buss & Shackelford, 1997; Schmitt, 2004b; Shackelford, Bes-
ser, & Goetz, 2008). Interestingly, responses in the qualitative
interviews emphasized on ``current'' financial/social status
rather than ``potential'' status. For example, ``having a good
financial status,'' ``having housing,'' and ``having a good
6 Evolutionary Psychology
income level'' are suggesting the importance of current status
(compare with potential). The characteristic ``tall'' has been
recently recognized as a particularly important characteristic
for females (Stulp et al., 2013) and this was reflected in our
qualitative analyses. ``Similar cultural background'' also
resembles characteristics which measure similarity (e.g., simi-
lar political background).
``Qeirati'' is a newly discovered important characteristic
with cultural value. As mentioned before, to our knowledge,
no single adjective in English can completely capture the
meaning as perceived in Persian. This adjective is a male-
specific characteristic, which implies protecting female
members of the family from unwanted sexual attention or any
possible danger. Research suggests that, in perceived danger-
ous environments, women show a preference for protective and
physically formidable mates (Snyder et al., 2011). Therefore,
the present findings call for research on the relationship
between choosing Qeirati mates and other variables such as
domestic violence, childhood trauma, social perceptions, and
fear of crime.
The relationship between five factors of mate preference
and demographic details revealed that age was inversely asso-
ciated with all factors meaning that older women set lower
standards in choosing a mate. This finding may be explained
considering that the supply of available mates decreases with
age for women (Oppenheimer, 1988) and therefore they expand
their preferences in a potential mate (South, 1991). Also, it may
be explained by the fact that older women may have a weaker
bargaining hand in mating market (Fales et al., 2016). Yet,
previous research reported little in the way of age differences
(Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, & Kenrick, 2002; Schwarz &
Hassebrauck, 2012). Moreover, higher levels of education were
associated with stronger expectations for education/intelli-
gence factor and lower importance placed on religiosity/chas-
tity. Attractiveness/Sexuality subscale was also negatively
associated with educational level of participants. Ideal age for
marriage was inversely correlated with Religiosity/Chastity
(i.e., those who want to get married older are less inclined to
marry a religious person) and positively correlated with Edu-
cation/Intelligence subscale (i.e., those females who want to
get married older tend to marry a more educated/intelligent
person). Ideal age difference was only significantly correlated
with status/resources factor. This may be explained by the fact
that men with higher resources and social status tend to be older
(Kenrick & Keefe, 1992). Findings also revealed that those
with inclination toward more religious people desire a higher
number of children which is consistent with previous work
(Neuman & Ziderman, 1986). BMI was also significantly nega-
tively associated with attractiveness/sexuality factor; that is,
those who are more overweight tend to prefer less attractive
men. This is consistent with previous correlation between cou-
ples' BMI (Price & Vandenberg, 1980; Silventoinen, Kaprio,
Lahelma, Viken, & Rose, 2003).
The correlation coefficients between the five factors and
13 ranking characteristics may be considered as indicators
of concurrent validity of the dimensions. Each factor is
significantly correlated with the corresponding characteristics
in the 13-item ranking instrument (see Table 5). The ranks of
these 13 characteristics are also consistent with previous work
(Buss & Barnes, 1986).
Study 3 provided fit indices for the factor structure of the
26-item scale that was derived from preceding two studies. All
indices of fit fell within acceptable range. Moreover, all five
factors of mate preference were internally consistent. Factors
were also less strongly correlated suggesting relatively inde-
pendent dimensions of mate preference. The relative indepen-
dence of dimensions of mate preference in the current study is
consistent with previously reported universal dimensions of
mate preference (Shackelford et al., 2005).
Some limitations of this study are worth noting. First, this
study was conducted to investigate the dimensions of Iranian
mate preference. The 26-item list of characteristics may be
used within Iranian culture with acceptable validity and relia-
bility. It is also recommended for future research to cross-
culturally validate this scale. Some culture-specific variables
may be important in other cultural backgrounds as well. Sec-
ond, while there is evidence for temporal stability of mate
preferences, the current study did not assess test­retest relia-
bility of the 26-item list. Third, the present sample was drawn
from Tehran. Due to cultural plurality of Iran, it is recom-
mended to investigate the dimensions of mate preference in
other cities and cultures in Iran. Fourth, the sample size in
Study 3 is sufficient; however, small for a CFA. It is highly
recommended for future research to use confirmatory tech-
niques to confirm the five-factor structure of this newly devel-
oped scale.
Conclusion
In sum, the present study investigated a list of mate preferences
in Iranian women as an underrecognized population in evolu-
tionary psychological literature. A female-specific mate pre-
ference scale was developed and validated in three
consecutive studies. The five-factor structure of the newly
developed 26-item scale included kindness/dependability, sta-
tus/resources, attractiveness/sexuality, religiosity/chastity, and
education/intelligence. Therefore, this scale may be used as a
valid and reliable measure of female mate preferences.
