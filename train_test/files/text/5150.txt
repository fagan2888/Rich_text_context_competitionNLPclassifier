Introduction
In the past, vocabulary was sidelined in the area of language
learning and teaching because grammar was considered to be
the most important part of language and vocabulary was sec-
ondary to it (Milton, 2009). The developments in the area of
linguistics along with new sociocultural demands challenged
the status quo (Richards & Rodgers, 2003). More recently,
researchers (Amiryousefi & Kassaian, 2010; Amiryousefi &
Ketabi, 2011; Coady & Huckin, 1997; Hedge, 2008; Oxford &
Scarcella, 1994; Richards & Renandya, 2002; Schmitt, 2010)
have viewed vocabulary as an important part of language on
which effective communication relies. Schmitt (2010), for
example, believes that meaningful communication in a foreign
language depends mostly on words. If learners do not have the
available words to express their ideas, mastering grammatical
rules does not help. Vocabulary has, consequently, gained pop-
ularity in the general field of English language teaching and
learning, and research in second language lexical acquisition,
retention, and instruction has increased (Coady & Huckin,
1997; Hedge, 2008; Richards & Renandya, 2002).
During the previous decades, the area of language learning
and teaching has also been marked with the attempts to make
language learners autonomous (Harmer, 2001; Hedge, 2008).
Autonomy is believed to be the essence of language acquisi-
tion which can help language learners take charge of their
own learning (Little, 2007). One way through which language
learners can become autonomous is to help them use lan-
guage learning strategies (LLS) (Zarei & Elekaie, 2012).
LLSs are a set of conscious or semi-conscious thoughts and
behavior which are used by language learners to facilitate
their learning process (Cohen & Dornyei, 2002). Vocabulary
learning strategies (VLS) are also a part of LLSs which are
defined by Gu (2003) as those behavior and actions used by
language learners to use and to know vocabulary items.
The present study is, therefore, an attempt to explore the
Iranian EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners' and
teachers' beliefs about the usefulness of different types of
VLSs and to examine the effects of level of education on
their strategy preference.

Iranian EFL Learners' and Teachers'
Beliefs About the Usefulness of
Vocabulary Learning Strategies
Mohammad Amiryousefi1
Abstract
Vocabulary is an important part of language which is central to all language skills and meaningful communication. One way
through which vocabulary learning can be facilitated is by the use of vocabulary learning strategies (VLS). VLSs can empower
language learners to be more self-directed, regulated, and autonomous. Also, they can help language learners to discover
and consolidate the meaning of the words more effectively. Teachers' and students' behavior, functioning, and learning are,
however, controlled by their thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions. The present study was an effort to explore the
Iranian EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners' and teachers' beliefs about the usefulness of different types of VLSs. To
that end, a VLS questionnaire developed for this purpose was given to 392 EFL teachers and learners. Based on the results
of the study, the Iranian EFL learners and teachers believed that strategies such as paying attention to vocabulary forms,
functions, and semantic relations; guessing the meaning of new words from the context; and using monolingual dictionaries
can be very useful in discovering and consolidating the meaning of new words. They, nevertheless, expressed hesitancy to
use L1, bilingual dictionaries, and mnemonic devices. The results of Kruskal­Wallis Test also showed that the preference for
a few strategies differed across levels of education.

VLS
Although research on VLSs has been done for several
decades, the field has not been able to form a common and
unified definition of what the term exactly means. Various
authors and researchers (Catalan, 2003; Cohen & Dornyei,
2002; Gu, 2003; Nation, 2001; Takac, 2008) have defined
VLSs differently. Nation (2001), for example, believes that
VLSs are a part of LLSs which need to
1) involve choice. That is, there are several strategies to choose
from, 2) be complex. That is, there are several steps to learn, 3)
require knowledge and benefit from training, 4) increase the
efficiency of vocabulary learning and vocabulary use. (p. 352)
Cohen and Dornyei (2002), however, believe that VLSs
involve memorizing, recalling, reviewing, and using vocab-
ulary items. Catalan (2003) also believes that VLSs are
those actions which are taken by language learners to find
out the meaning of the words, to send them to their long-
term memory which is, based on Schmitt (2010), the ulti-
mate goal of vocabulary learning, to recall and to use the
words when needed. Takac (2008), however, believes that
VLSs are those strategies which are solely used for vocabu-
lary learning tasks.
In spite of the differences in definitions, almost all
researchers believe that studying VLSs can give teachers and
researchers useful insights. First, by exploring VLSs used by
different language learners, useful information can be
obtained regarding the cognitive, social, and affective pro-
cesses involved in vocabulary learning (Chamot, 2001).
Second, by exploring the VLSs used by successful learners a
list of useful strategies can be prepared to be taught to less
successful language learners to help and support them in
their language learning process (H. D. Brown, 2014). Third,
by exploring the beliefs and attitudes of language learners
about different VLSs, useful information can be obtained
about their desired and expected behavior and actions
(Schmitt, 2010). Learners' expectations and desires have big
impacts on their learning behavior because, according to
Schmitt (2010), if language learners do not value specific
behavior and actions, they will not have the needed motiva-
tion which is the very first step in the language learning pro-
cess. Fourth, Tseng, Dornyei, and Schmitt (2006) believe
that VLSs are the ways through which language learners can
be empowered to be more self-directed in their learning. By
exploring the beliefs and attitudes about different VLSs or by
getting information about the whats and hows of VLSs,
teachers can raise their awareness about what works for and
what works against their learners (H. D. Brown, 2014).
Finally, research has shown that students from different cul-
tural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds do not benefit
from the same strategies (Gu, 2003; Tran, 2011). It means
that culture plays an important role in vocabulary learning
and VLS use. Language learners from different cultures may
find different VLSs useful (Schmitt, 2000). By exploring the
beliefs and perceptions of language learners about different
VLSs, teachers will know what strategies to focus on.
VLS Classifications
Different taxonomies and classifications of VLSs are avail-
able in the literature of vocabulary learning and teaching
(Klapper, 2008; Nation, 2001; Rubin & Thompson, 1994;
Schmitt, 1997). Rubin and Thompson's (1994) taxonomy of
VLS, for example, consists of three major parts: (a) direct
approach, (b) indirect approach, and (c) mnemonics. Direct
approach contains strategies such as saying or writing the
words several times and putting the words on cards which
direct language learners' attention to vocabulary items them-
selves. Indirect approach, however, contains those strategies
such as reading a text and trying to make sense of it which
focus learners' attention to language learning tasks rather
than individual vocabulary items. Mnemonics also contain
strategies such as grouping the words and relating them to a
picture which are used to retain the words in the memory.
Schmitt's (1997) taxonomy, however, consists of 58 strate-
gies which can be divided into two broad categories, namely,
discovery strategies which are used to discover the meaning
of the words and consolidation strategies which are used to
retain them. Schmitt's (1997) taxonomy is believed to be the
most comprehensive one because it is specifically prepared
for vocabulary learning, and there is little overlap between
the classifications of the strategies (Akbari & Tahririan,
2009). Nation (2001) in his taxonomy of different kinds of
VLSs makes a difference between aspects of vocabulary
knowledge, sources of vocabulary knowledge, and learning
processes (pp. 352-353). Aspects of vocabulary knowledge
refer to what is involved in knowing a word such as its writ-
ten and spoken forms, sources of vocabulary knowledge
refer to the context in which the word is used and learning
processes refer to those actions that lead to the learning and
retention of the given words. His taxonomy, therefore, con-
sists of three major parts, namely, planning strategies which
are used to choose what to focus on, source strategies which
are used to find information about words, and process strate-
gies which are used to establish vocabulary knowledge.
Klapper (2008), however, divides VLSs into the strategies
which are used in explicit learning of vocabulary and those
which are used in implicit vocabulary learning. Strategies
such as analyzing vocabulary items, using cards, or keeping
vocabulary notebooks are used in implicit learning, whereas
strategies such as listening to stories, watching movies, or
reading stories are the ones used in implicit learning. Tran
(2011) modified the taxonomy developed by Catalan (2003)
to study the Vietnamese EFL teachers' perceptions about
vocabulary learning and teaching. His taxonomy contains 68
items which are also divided into two main parts, namely,
discovery strategies and consolidation strategies. The dis-
covery part has strategies such as leafing through the diction-
ary to learn words and asking the teacher for an L1 translation
Amiryousefi 3
which can help language learners to discover the meaning of
the words. The consolidation part, however, has strategies
such as using scales for gradable adjectives and using mne-
monic devices which can be helpful in consolidating the
meaning of the learned items.
The Importance of Students' and
Teachers' Beliefs
Research (Borg, 2003; Nation & Macalister, 2010; Phipps &
Borg, 2009; Rashidi & Moghadam, 2014; Riley, 2009) in the
field of language teaching and learning has shown that stu-
dents' and teachers' beliefs about the nature of language and
language learning and teaching affect their pedagogical prac-
tices in the classroom. It is believed that beliefs affect stu-
dents' and teachers' autonomy and success in language
learning and teaching, and underlie all choices they make.
Differences in beliefs can, therefore, make students' and
teachers' approach a learning task differently despite their
similarities in language proficiency and level of education.
Beliefs also influence students' and teachers' personal attri-
butes such as anxiety and motivation (Riley, 2009). Nation
and Macalister (2010) believe that what teachers and stu-
dents do is determined by their beliefs. In the same fashion,
Phipps and Borg (2009) believe that students' and teachers'
beliefs act as a filter through which all practices and experi-
ences are passed and interpreted. The social-cognitive theory
also states that a student or a teacher's behavior, learning,
and actions are products of a continuous interaction between
cognitive, behavioral, and contextual factors. That is, a stu-
dent or a teacher's behavior, actions, and learning or teaching
are shaped by factors such as the reinforcements experienced
by himself or herself and/or by other's beliefs, perceptions,
and interpretation of the task and context (Bembenutty &
White, 2013; Kitsantas & Zimmerman, 2009). Language
learners' use of LLSs in general and VLSs in particular is,
consequently, affected by factors such as their own and their
classmates' and teachers' beliefs about their usefulness and
effectiveness. Beliefs are, nevertheless, considered to be
dynamic and may change over time or may change as teach-
ers' and students' factors such as level of education change
(Barcelos & Kalaja, 2011; Zhong, 2014).
Riley (2009), however, believes that if teachers' and stu-
dents' beliefs are consistent with each other, there will be a
supportive atmosphere in the classroom which will enhance
the quality of learning and teaching. Otherwise, there will be
a clash and lack of understanding between the teachers and
the students which may lead to dissatisfaction (Rashidi &
Moghadam, 2014; Riley, 2009). Examining students' and
teachers' beliefs about different aspects of language teaching
and learning can, therefore, provide valuable information
about what practices and tasks are considered useful by
teachers and students to be included and what differences
exist between their beliefs to be taken into account.
The Purpose of the Present Study
Under the umbrella of social-cognitive theory (Bembenutty
& White, 2013; Kitsantas & Zimmerman, 2009), which
states that beliefs and thoughts are powerful and can affect
human beings' behavior and functioning and with regard to
the importance attached to the role of LLSs in making lan-
guage learners autonomous (Zarei & Elekaie, 2012), the
value credited to the role of vocabulary in language learning
and the role of culture in vocabulary learning and VLS use
(Schmitt, 2000, 2010), the present study is an endeavor to
explore the Iranian EFL learners' and teachers' beliefs about
the usefulness of different types of VLSs. The present study,
therefore, addresses the following research questions:
Research Question 1: What are the most useful VLSs in
the Iranian EFL learners' and teachers' opinions?
Research Question 2: Does the level of education affect
the participants' beliefs about the usefulness of VLSs?
The Study
The Participants
The sample of the study included 392 participants comprising
320 students and 72 English teachers. The participants of the
study were English learners and teachers of four big and
famous institutes (Iran Language Institute, Pouyesh, Gouyesh,
and Iranian Academic Center for Education, Culture and
Research (ACECR) in Isfahan, Iran. The students participated
in this study were learning English in different levels from
elementary to advanced at the adults' departments of these
institutes in the spring semester of 2014. Their age ranged
from 16 to 43, and their degrees ranged from high school
diploma to PhD. The majority of the teachers were also
female. Their age ranged from 21 to 58, and they had different
degrees in English from BA to PhD. Table 1 shows the char-
acteristics of the participants of the study.
The Instrument
To elicit the required data, a 5-point Likert-type scale ques-
tionnaire was used. The VLS questionnaire was developed
based on the questionnaire used by Tran (2011) to study the
Vietnamese teachers' beliefs about vocabulary learning and
teaching. The original questionnaire contained 63 items which
were divided into two broad categories of discovery strategies
and consolidation strategies. Based on the characteristics of
the Iranian EFL learners, teachers, and teaching and learning
context, it was, however, reduced to 54 items, and some of the
items were also reworded. The anchor points for the existing
items ranged from 1 = very useless to 5 = very useful. It was
also divided into discovery strategies with 15 items and con-
solidation strategies with 39 items. Discovery part of the ques-
tionnaire contained strategies such as checking the meaning of

the words in a bilingual or monolingual dictionary and guess-
ing the meaning of the unknown words which can be used by
language learners to arrive at the meaning of the words, while
consolidation part contained strategies such as writing words
down or saying them aloud several times to remember them,
reviewing the words, and relating the words to personal expe-
riences or pictures which are used to consolidate their mean-
ing. Based on J. D. Brown's (2001) suggestion to minimize the
measurement errors, the questionnaire was translated into
Farsi, the participants' native language and the Farsi format
was given to the participants.
The final format was reviewed by six experienced teach-
ers and scholars, and based on their validation necessary
changes were made. To check the validity of the question-
naire, factor analysis with varimax rotation was also used. As
shown in Table 2, the Kaiser­Meyer­Olkin (KMO) is bigger
than 0.6 (KMO = 0.618 > 0.6), which shows that the 54 strat-
egies fit into the two main tentative factors as originally
hypothesized (i.e., discovery and consolidation strategies).
It was also given to a group of 32 English teachers and 69
English learners which were comparable with the partici-
pants of the study to explore its reliability and the following
results were obtained. As shown in Table 3, is bigger than .7
for both the students and the teachers, which shows the reli-
ability of the instrument used.
Results
The data were prepared for analysis and then analyzed using
the statistical package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version
16. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the responses
to the items available in the questionnaire. For the sake of
simplicity and space, the responses of the students and teach-
ers to each part of the questionnaire are summarized in Table
4. The first column of Table 4 (ranks) presents Likert-type
scale values (from very useless to very useful), and the
numbers in the next columns show the percent of the stu-
dents and teachers who selected those scales for each part.
As shown in Table 4, around 89% of the students and 87%
of teachers had selected either useful or very useful for the
items available in the discovery part of the questionnaire,
and around 87% of the students and 88% of the teachers had
selected useful or very useful for the items available in the
consolidation part. Generally speaking, the results show that
the majority of the participants believed that both discovery
and consolidation strategies are useful in vocabulary learn-
ing. These results are, however, too general and belong to
those participants who had selected one of the anchor points
of very useless, useless, useful, and very useful. The rest who
had not responded or had selected "no idea" were excluded
in the calculation of the general percent of each part of the
questionnaire. The details about the most valued strategies
are, however, presented in the following parts.
The Most Useful Strategies
To extract the most useful strategies in the participants' opin-
ions, the frequency of the responses to each item of the ques-
tionnaire was calculated. The items for which at least 60% of
the respondents had selected the anchor points of useful or
very useful were marked as the most useful and the rest were
discarded. Finally, 6 discovery and 20 consolidation strate-
gies remained for the students, and 8 discovery and 25 con-
solidation strategies remained for the teachers. The results are
shown in the following tables. Numbers 1 to 5 used in the
tables, respectively, show 1 = very useless, 2 = useless, 3 = no
idea, 4 = useful, 5 = very useful, and the numbers used under
them show the percent of the teachers and the students who
selected each of these anchor points. The letter "M" stands for
the mean and "SD" for the standard deviation of the responses
to the items listed. As it is clear, the teachers and the students
did not agree on the usefulness of several strategies.
Table 5 shows the results for those discovery strategies
which were rated as the most useful by both the students and
teachers. As shown in Table 5, both the teachers and the stu-
dents believed that strategies such as paying attention to the
function, suffixes and prefixes of the words, using monolin-
gual dictionaries, guessing the meaning of the words and
asking the teacher to use the words in English sentences, or
give synonyms for them can be useful in discovering their
meaning.
Table 6, however, shows those strategies which were
rated as the most useful only by the teachers. The teachers,
unlike the students, believed that if the learners try to link

English words to some Farsi ones and pay attention to the
available pictures and clues, they can get their meaning bet-
ter. The majority of the students did not, however, think so.
Table 7, on the other hand, shows the most useful consoli-
dation strategies in both the teachers' and students' opinions.
As stated earlier, these strategies can be used to consolidate
the meaning of the learned vocabulary elements. As shown
in Table 7, both the teachers and the students believed that
strategies such as using the words in interactions, learning
the words in sentences, checking the pronunciation of the
words, repeating the words, listening to English music, and
watching English movies can be useful in consolidating the
meaning of the words and sending them to long-term mem-
ory for future use.
Table 8, however, contains those consolidation strategies
which were rated only by the teachers as the most useful
strategies to be used to consolidate the meaning of the already
learned vocabulary elements. The Iranian EFL teachers,

consequently, believed that activities such as relating the
words to personal experiences, using flash cards, listening to
tapes or CDs containing the words, and keeping a vocabulary
notebook can be useful in consolidating the meaning of
vocabulary elements.
The majority of the Iranian EFL learners did not, how-
ever, agree on the usefulness of the strategies listed in Table
8. As shown in Table 9, they believed that, along with the
strategies listed in Table 7, memorizing the newly learned
vocabulary items can also be a useful practice in consoli-
dating their meaning. However, the majority of the teachers
did not believe that memorization can be a useful activity in

The Iranian EFL learners and teachers did not, neverthe-
less, believe in the usefulness of mnemonic strategies such as
the key-word method and the loci method which have a long-
standing position in the literature.
The Effect of Educational Level on Strategy
Preference
To examine the effects of level of education on the strategy
preference, at first the participants were divided into differ-
ent groups based on the degrees they held. Accordingly, the
teachers were divided into three groups: (a) BA, (b) MA, and
(c) PhD, and the students into four groups: (a) diploma, (b)
associate degree, (c) BA, and (d) MA and higher. The reason
why the students with MA and PhD degrees were classified
into one group was that only a very small number (3) of the
students had a PhD degree. Then the Kruskal­Wallis Test

was used due to the nonexistence of normality in the data to
measure the effects of level of education on the students' and
teachers' strategy preference. The results of the Kruskal­
Wallis Test used for the teachers showed that for all 54 items
available in the VLS questionnaire the p values were bigger
than .05 showing that there was not a meaningful difference
between the responses of the teachers in the three groups to
the items available in the VLS questionnaire.
However, as shown in Table 10, the results of the Kruskal­
Wallis Test used for the students suggested that for the con-
solidation strategies (a) trying to use the words in interactions;
(b) associating the word with its word coordinates, for
instance, apple is associated with peach, orange . . .; and (c)
reviewing the vocabulary section of the textbook the p values
were, respectively, .023, .034, and .025 which were less than
.05 representing a meaningful difference between the
responses of the students in the four groups to these items.
An inspection of the mean ranks showed (Table 10) that
for Strategy Number 1, the mean rank of the students with an
associate degree was 71.94, which was the highest. The fre-
quency of the responses of the students in different groups to
the options available for this strategy also showed that all the
students (100%) with an associate degree had selected the
anchor points of useful or very useful indicating that in these
students'opinions trying to use the newly learned vocabulary
elements in interactions can be a very good practice to con-
solidate their meaning. This strategy was also selected as one
of the most useful consolidation strategies in both the teach-
ers' and the students' opinions (Table 7).
For Strategy Number 2, the highest rank, as shown in
Table 10, was 81.15 which belonged to the students holding
MA or higher. The frequency of the students' responses to
the options available for this strategy showed that around
50% of these students had selected either useful or very use-
ful showing that about half of these students believed that
associating a word with its word coordinates can help them
consolidate its meaning. The majority of the students in other
groups had either no idea regarding the usefulness of this
strategy or selected useless or very useless.
The highest rank for Strategy Number 3 was 64.26 which
belonged to the students with a BA degree. The frequency of
the responses of the students with a BA degree to this item
showed that around 85% of them had selected useful or very
useful for this strategy. As indicated in Table 7, this strategy
was also selected as one of the most useful consolidating
strategies in both the teachers' and the students' opinions.
Discussion and Conclusion
From the last half of the 20th century on, the field of language
teaching and learning has been marked with the efforts to
shift the attentions from teacher-centered classes to learner-
centered ones. To this end, terms such as autonomy, aware-
ness-raising, and self-regulation have made their way into the
field (H.D. Brown, 2014). In learner-centered classes, the
emphasis is on making the learners independent and self-reg-
ulated. To do so, learners should become strategic learners,
that is, they should be instructed to use LLSs (Schmitt, 2010).
Teachers'and students'thoughts, perceptions, and beliefs are,
however, important forces that can have great effects on the
decisions they make and the pedagogical practices they use.
Teachers' and students' actions, decisions, and functioning
are, therefore, sifted through their thoughts and beliefs
(Bembenutty & White, 2013; Kitsantas & Zimmerman,
2009). Exploring their beliefs about different aspects of lan-
guage teaching and learning can provide useful insights about
the processes involved. It can also raise teachers' and learn-
ers' awareness about what works and what does not (H.D.
Brown, 2014).
The present study was, therefore, an effort to explore the
Iranian EFL teachers' and learners' beliefs about the useful-
ness of different types of VLSs and to examine the effects of
level of education on their strategy preference. The results of
the study showed that the students valued 6 discovery strate-
gies (e.g., paying attention to the function of the word in the
sentence, paying attention to the prefixes and suffixes, and
guessing the meaning of the words) and 19 consolidation strat-
egies (e.g., using the words in interactions, connecting the
words to their synonyms and antonyms, and imagining the
meaning of the words). The teachers also believed that these
strategies were useful for vocabulary learning except for
memorizing the words which was believed to be useful only
by the students as a consolidation strategy. The teachers, how-
ever, valued 2 more discovery strategies (linking the English
word to a Farsi one that reminds the learners of the English
word's form and meaning, and analyzing the available pictures
Amiryousefi 9
and clues) and 6 more consolidation strategies (e.g., connect-
ing the word meaning to a personal experience, using flash
cards and keeping a vocabulary notebook) for which the stu-
dents did not show a high esteem. The results of Kruskal­
Wallis Test also showed that the teachers' beliefs about the
usefulness of different VLSs were not affected by their level of
education. However, the preference for a few strategies dif-
fered across levels of education for the students.
By considering the strategies which were valued by the
participants of the study, it can be inferred that for the Iranian
EFL teachers and learners: (a) Paying attention to the form of
vocabulary items is considered to be important in both dis-
covering the meaning of the words and consolidating them.
It can be seen in strategies such as paying attention to the
grammatical functions of the words, analyzing the word
affixes or considering them, and paying attention to the spell-
ing and the spoken form of the words; (b) mechanical activi-
ties such as repeating the words, saying them aloud, or
writing them down several times are also deemed essential;
(c) the context is very important both during the first encoun-
ter with the words to understand their meaning and during
the time the learners try to retain them; (d) guessing the
meaning from the context and paying attention to the word
relations can also promote vocabulary learning; and (e)
vocabulary production has also an important place. It can be
done through activities such as linking the new words in a
story or using them in the interactions with peers and teach-
ers. Strategy preference may, however, be affected by learn-
ers' factors such as level of education.
The results of the present study can further support the
importance of context, word lists, semantic relation among
words, guessing the meaning of words from context, and
vocabulary production in vocabulary learning and retention
which are also proved useful by the studies done in the litera-
ture (Krashen, 2004; Nassaji, 2003; Nation, 2002; Schmitt,
1997, 2010; Tran, 2011; Waring, 1997). However, the results
of the present study do not support the results of the studies
done by researchers such as Folse (2004) and Prince (1996),
who found that L1 can be facilitative in vocabulary learning,
and bilingual dictionaries can provide students with useful
information. The present study, on the contrary, showed that
the majority of the Iranian EFL teachers and learners
expressed hesitancy to use translation activities and tasks, L1
equivalents, and English to Farsi dictionaries for vocabulary
learning. Also, the majority of the participants did not agree
on the usefulness of mnemonic devices such as the key-word
method and the loci method which have a long-standing
position in the literature of vocabulary learning and teaching
and are believed to contribute to vocabulary learning and
retention (Amiryousefi & Ketabi, 2011; Sagarra & Alba,
2006). It can be due to the cultural factors which are believed
to have an important role in VLS use (Schmitt, 2000). The
results of the present study can, to some extent, support the
fact that beliefs are dynamic and the changes in the learners'
and teachers' attributes such as the level of education may
result in a change in their beliefs about different aspects of
language learning and teaching (Barcelos & Kalaja, 2011;
Zhong, 2014).
As the results of the present study suggest, teachers should
be cognizant of the fact that their beliefs do not always match
their students' beliefs. Teachers and students are, conse-
quently, recommended to articulate their educational beliefs.
In this way, teachers can raise their awareness about their
students' accurate and inaccurate beliefs about all aspects of
language learning and teaching in general and about vocabu-
lary learning and teaching in particular. It can help teachers
justify their educational practices which in their students'
opinions are not useful or logical to stimulate satisfaction
and cooperation in their students and hence increase the
quality of teaching and learning (H. D. Brown, 2014; Murray
& Christison, 2011; Rashidi & Moghadam, 2014).
