Context.--Although cholesterol-reducing treatment has been shown to reduce
fatal and nonfatal coronary disease in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD),
it is unknown whether benefit from the reduction of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD extends to individuals with average serum
cholesterol levels, women, and older persons.
Objective.--To compare lovastatin with placebo for prevention of the first acute
major coronary event in men and women without clinically evident atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease with average total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C levels and
below-average high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.
Design.--A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
Setting.--Outpatient clinics in Texas.
Participants.--A total of 5608 men and 997 women with average TC and LDL-C
and below-average HDL-C (as characterized by lipid percentiles for an age- and
sex-matched cohort without cardiovascular disease from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] III). Mean (SD) TC level was 5.71 (0.54)
mmol/L (221 [21] mg/dL) (51st percentile), mean (SD) LDL-C level was 3.89 (0.43)
mmol/L (150 [17] mg/dL) (60th percentile), mean (SD) HDL-C level was 0.94 (0.14)
mmol/L (36 [5] mg/dL) for men and 1.03 (0.14) mmol/L (40 [5] mg/dL) for women
(25th and 16th percentiles, respectively), and median (SD) triglyceride levels were
1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76] mg/dL) (63rd percentile).
Intervention.--Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) or placebo in addition to a low­
saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet.
Main Outcome Measures.--First acute major coronary event defined as fatal
or nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death.
Results.--After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, lovastatin reduced the inci-
denceoffirstacutemajorcoronaryevents(183vs116firstevents;relativerisk[RR],
0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.79; P.001), myocardial infarction (95 vs
57 myocardial infarctions; RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P = .002), unstable angina
(87 vs 60 first unstable angina events; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.95; P = .02), coro-
nary revascularization procedures (157 vs 106 procedures; RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-
0.85; P = .001), coronary events (215 vs 163 coronary events; RR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.61-0.92; P = .006), and cardiovascular events (255 vs 194 cardiovascular events;
RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91; P = .003). Lovastatin (20-40 mg daily) reduced LDL-C
by 25% to 2.96 mmol/L (115 mg/dL) and increased HDL-C by 6% to 1.02 mmol/L
(39 mg/dL). There were no clinically relevant differences in safety parameters be-
tween treatment groups.
Conclusions.--Lovastatin reduces the risk for the first acute major coronary
event in men and women with average TC and LDL-C levels and below-average
HDL-C levels. These findings support the inclusion of HDL-C in risk-factor assess-
ment, confirm the benefit of LDL-C reduction to a target goal, and suggest the need

ing pharmacological intervention.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL observations
have demonstrated consistently a strong
positive,continuous,independent,graded
relation between plasma total choles-
terol (TC) and the incidence of coronary
heart disease (CHD). This relation cov-
ers a wide range of cholesterol concen-
trations, including those considered nor-
mal or mildly elevated.1-3 In the Multiple
Risk Factor Intervention Trial follow-up
ofscreenedmen,69%ofdeathsfromCHD
in the first 6 years of follow-up occurred
in subjects with TC values between 4.71
and6.83mmol/L(182-264mg/dL).4 Inthe
first 16 years of the Framingham Heart
Study, 40% of participants who devel-
opedamyocardialinfarctionhadaTClevel

the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coen-
zyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin
reduced total mortality in patients with
CHD by 30% because of a 42% reduction
in deaths from CHD.6 Subsequently,
pravastatin was shown to reduce fatal
and nonfatal coronary events in patients
with7 and without8 CHD. However, it is
unknown whether benefit from reduc-
tion of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) in patients without CHD
(primary prevention) extends to indi-
viduals with average serum cholesterol
levels, women, and older persons.
The Air Force/Texas Coronary Ath-
erosclerosisPreventionStudy(AFCAPS/
TexCAPS) targeted a cohort of gener-
ally healthy middle-aged and older men
and women with average TC and LDL-C
levels and with below-average high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
levels.Theprimaryendpointanalysiswas
the incidence of first acute major coro-
nary events, defined as fatal or nonfatal
myocardialinfarction,unstableangina,or
suddencardiacdeath.Theinclusionofun-
stableanginawasauniquefeatureofthis
study, and its inclusion as a primary end
point reflectsthe increasingfrequencyof
unstable angina as the initial presenta-
tion of CHD in the United States.9
METHODS
The design of the study has been de-
scribed in detail previously.10 In sum-
mary,AFCAPS/TexCAPSwasarandom-
ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
primary prevention trial that included
6605 men and women and was conducted
at 2 sites in Texas, Lackland Air Force
Base in San Antonio (n = 3737) and Uni-
versity of North Texas Health Science
Center in Fort Worth (n = 2868).
AFCAPS/TexCAPS was powered to
investigate whether long-term lipid low-
ering with lovastatin would decrease the
rate of first acute major coronary events
compared with placebo during at least 5
yearsoffollow-upinacohortwithoutclini-
calevidenceofatheroscleroticcardiovas-
cular disease and with average TC and
LDL-Clevelsandbelow-averageHDL-C
levels. Unstable angina was prospec-
tively defined and required new-onset
exertional angina, accelerated or rest an-
gina, or both, and at least 1 of the follow-
ing:(1)electrocardiographicfindingsofat
least 1-mm ST-segment changes and re-
versibledefectonstressperfusionstudy,
(2) angiographic findings of at least 90%
epicardial vessel stenosis or at least 50%
stenosis in the left main coronary artery
(without exercise testing), or (3) at least
1-mm ST-segment changes with pain on
electrocardiographic stress testing and/
or rest electrocardiograph and evidence
of at least 50% stenosis in a major epicar-
dial vessel.
Secondary objectives were to investi-
gate whether long-term treatment with
lovastatin,comparedwithplacebo,would
decrease cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality across the spectrum of clinical
events by measuring the rates of 7 sec-
ondary end points, including 2 compo-
nents of the primary end point. The sec-
ondaryendpointswere(1)fatalornonfatal
coronary revascularization procedures,
(2) unstable angina, (3) fatal or nonfatal
myocardial infarction, (4) fatal or nonfa-
talcardiovascularevents,(5)fatalornon-
fatal coronary events, (6) cardiovascular
mortality, and (7) CHD mortality.
The tertiary objectives were to inves-
tigate safety, that is, whether long-term
treatmentwithlovastatin,comparedwith
placebo, would result in similar rates of
total mortality, noncardiovascular mor-
tality (with subset analyses for uninten-
tional or violent death and death from
cancer), fatal and nonfatal cancer (ex-
cluding basal cell and squamous cell skin
cancers), and discontinuation of medica-
tion because of adverse drug effects.

All participants provided written in-
formed consent.
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board
and the institutional review boards of the
2 participating centers approved the con-
sentformandprotocol.Thestudywascon-
ducted under the supervision of a steer-
ingcommittee.Administrative,clinical,and
datamanagementwasperformedbyacon-
tract research organization with staff at
each site who were under the supervision
of the clinical investigator. All personnel
involved in participant care were blinded
to treatment assignment and lipid levels.
Participants who met entrance crite-
ria and completed a 12-week American
Heart Association Step I diet run-in,
including a 2-week placebo baseline
run-in, were randomized to treatment
witheitherlovastatin,20mg/d,ormatch-
ing placebo. Participants in the lovas-
tatin group were titrated to 40 mg/d if
their LDL-C level was more than 2.84
mmol/L(110mg/dL)atthe3-monthstudy
visit. The blind was maintained by titrat-
ing equal numbers of randomly selected
placebo-group participants to 2 tablets
daily. Throughout the trial, dietary re-
inforcement and other risk factor modi-
fication information was provided.
An extensive safety evaluation was
performed prior to treatment, at 1 year,
and at each subsequent year-end visit.
Clinical visits were every 6 weeks for the
first year. After 1 year, all randomized
participants who continued the study
drug were seen semiannually. Partici-
pants who discontinued use of the study
drug were contacted on an annual basis
for follow-up by questionnaire, which in-
cluded an assessment of possible end
point events and cancer occurrence. End
pointeventinformationwascompiledand
adjudicated in the same manner for all
participants, including those who had
withdrawn from the study. An end point
committee, blinded to treatment-group
assignment and not involved in partici-
pant care, used prespecified criteria to
adjudicate all end point events.
For analyses of changes in lipids, fro-
zen serum samples obtained on the date
of randomization before active treat-
ment(day1)andatthe1-yearvisit(post-
treatment) were assayed at a special-
ized lipid laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, Md. This labora-
toryalsoanalyzedlipidsfortheNational
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) III as noted by Sempos
et al11 (also P. S. Bachorik, PhD, unpub-
lished data, 1997). The laboratory was
standardized for lipid and lipoprotein
measurements through the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention­Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
Lipid Standardization Program.12 All
LDL-C values were calculated based on
the Friedewald estimation.13
Statistical Analysis

tion-to-treat basis and all P values were
2-sided. A log-rank test, with study cen-
ter and sex as stratification factors, was
used to assess the effect of therapy on
the rate of primary end point events.
Analyses of relative reductions in risk
resulting from lovastatin therapy were
calculated using the Cox proportional
hazardsregressionmodelthathadstudy
center and sex as stratification factors.
Theproportionalityassumptionwasmet
forallCoxmodels.Cumulativeincidence
and interval estimates were calculated
using the life-table method.
The effect of therapy on percent
change in lipid parameters from base-
line to 1 year was assessed using an
analysis of variance model that included
treatment, study center, and sex after
first examining a model that also in-
cluded the treatment-by-center and
treatment-by-sexinteractioneffects.All
participants with data at both baseline
and 1 year were included.

discontinuedtherapybecauseofadverse
events or had clinically important ad-
verse events or laboratory abnormali-
tieswerecomparedbetweenthe2treat-
mentgroupsusingtheFisherexacttest.
The trial was designed to continue un-
til a total of 320 participants had expe-
rienced a first primary end point event
or for a minimum of 5 years after the last
participant was randomized, whichever
occurred later. In addition to the final
analysis, 2 interim analyses of the trial
were planned for the points at which 120
and240participants,respectively,expe-
rienced the first primary end point
event. A group sequential design was
used with an early stopping rule, de-
scribed previously,10 which preserved
the type I error probability of .05. The
critical values for finding statistical sig-
nificance for 120, 240, and 320 partici-
pantswithprimaryendpointswere.003,
.016, and .044, respectively.
RESULTS
Early Termination for Efficacy
Following a review of the second in-
terimanalysis(datafrom267participants
who had experienced a primary end point
event), the Data and Safety Monitoring
Board recommended that the trial be

bers of the steering committee agreed

Baseline Characteristics
Beginning May 30, 1990, and ending
February 12, 1993, 6605 participants
were randomized to treatment with lo-
vastatin (2805 men and 499 women) or
placebo (2803 men and 498 women). For
comparison with the age- and sex-
matched US population without clinical
evidence of cardiovascular disease, the
NHANESIIIpercentileispresentedfor
average baseline lipid levels.14 Baseline
lipidlevelsweresimilarinbothtreatment
groups; combined averages were as fol-
lows: mean (SD) TC, 5.71 (0.54) mmol/L
(221 [21] mg/dL) (51st percentile); mean
(SD) LDL-C, 3.89 (0.43) mmol/L (150 [17]
mg/dL) (60th percentile); mean (SD)

dL)formenand1.03(0.14)mmol/L(40[5]

tiles, respectively); and median (SD) tri-
glycerides, 1.78 (0.86) mmol/L (158 [76]
mg/dL) (63rd percentile). The 2 treat-
ment groups were also balanced with re-
spect to baseline demographics, risk fac-
tors, and medications (Table 1). A more
detailed description of the baseline char-
acteristicsofthestudycohortincompari-
son with the US NHANES III reference
population is provided elsewhere.15
Adherence and Dropouts
The mean (SD) duration of follow-up
was 5.2 (0.9) years (range, 0.2-7.2 years)
for those treated with lovastatin and 5.2
(0.9) years (range, 0.1-7.2 years) in the
placebo group. As assessed by pill
counts, 99% of participants adhered to
their study regimen for at least 75% of
the time that they were receiving active
treatment. Study drug regimens were
maintained until trial termination by
2335 (71%) of the 3304 participants ran-
domized to lovastatin and by 2081 (63%)
of the 3301 randomized to placebo (Fig-
ure1).Participantstreatedwithplacebo
were more likely to be withdrawn from
the study as a result of developing CHD
orstartingcholesterol-reducingmedica-
tion (generally at the request of their
primary care physician). The frequency
of discontinuation for other reasons was
similar between treatment groups.
Lipid Parameters
Lovastatin had a significant effect on
changes in lipid levels from baseline
(day 1) to posttreatment as assessed at
1 year (P.001). Low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol levels were reduced by
25%, TC levels were reduced by 18%,
triglyceridelevelswerereducedby15%,
HDL-C levels were increased by 6%,
and the ratios of TC to HDL-C and
LDL-C to HDL-C were decreased by
22% and 28%, respectively. By compari-
son, in the placebo group, there were
small changes in lipid levels that were
not clinically important (Figure 2).
Treatment effects were similar in men
and women (Table 2).
In the lovastatin group, 1657 partici-
pants (50%) were titrated from 20 mg/d
to 40 mg/d, and of these, no participant
was subsequently back-titrated. At 1
year, 1216 participants (42%) receiving
lovastatin and 86 (3%) receiving placebo
reachedthestudytargetforLDL-Cval-
ues of no more than 2.84 mmol/L (110
mg/dL); 2334 participants (81%) receiv-
ing lovastatin and 350 (12%) receiving
placebo reached an LDL-C level of 3.36
mmol/L (130 mg/dL) or less.

A total of 116 participants treated
withlovastatincomparedwith183inthe
placebo group had at least 1 primary end
point event. Results of primary and sec-
ondary end point analyses are summa-
rizedinTable3.Participantsarecounted
only once within a specific end point
analysis; however, a participant may be
included in more than 1 analysis in Table
3 if they experienced different types of
end points, experienced an event that is
comprised in more than 1 end point
analysis(eg,thesecondaryendpoint,un-
stable angina, is also a component of the
primary end point), or both.
Life-table plots (Figure 3) illustrate a
difference between treatment groups
beginning in the first year of treatment
and continuing throughout the remain-
der of the study. These show the cumu-
lative incidence and the number of par-
ticipants at risk. By treatment year, the
average risk reduction in the primary
end point (acute major coronary events)
with lovastatin was 43% in the first year
and 12%, 30%, 41%, and 49% in the sec-
ond, third, fourth, and fifth years, re-
spectively. These yearly rates were not
statistically different from each other.
For the primary end point, the event
rateforsubjectsreceivinglovastatinav-
eraged 7 per 1000 patient-years and was
37% less than the 11 per 1000 patient-
years observed for the placebo group.
Theseratescorrespondtocumulativein-
cidences of 4.0% and 6.8% for the lovas-
tatin and placebo groups, respectively,
during the study period (P.001).
For secondary end points, treatment
withlovastatinresultedinsignificant,con-
sistentbenefitcomparedwithplacebo,in-
cluding 33% reduction in revasculariza-
tions(P=.001),32%reductioninunstable
angina (P=.02), and 40% reduction in the
incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocardial
infarction(P=.002).Forcoronaryandcar-
diovascular events (total fatal or nonfa-
tal),treatmentwithlovastatinresultedin
significant (P=.006 and P=.003, respec-
tively) reductions of 25% compared with
placebo. The category of cardiovascular
eventsincludedallatheroscleroticcardio-
vascular events, as specified by the end
point definitions, including stable an-
gina, thrombotic cerebrovascular acci-
dents,transientischemicattacks,andpe-
ripheral arterial vascular disorders. For
the secondary end points fatal cardiovas-
cular events and fatal CHD events, there
were too few events to perform survival
analysis based on prespecified criteria
(Table 3).
Figure 4 summarizes the effect of
treatmentontherateofthefirstprimary
end point event for predefined factors:
sex, age (older defined as above the me-
dian by sex: 57 years for men and 62
years for women), history of hyperten-
sion,activecigarettesmoking,familyhis-
tory of CHD, baseline LDL-C, and base-
line HDL-C. Treatment group, as well as
eachofthesefactors,demonstratedasig-
nificant association with risk (eg, smok-
ing was positively associated with first
acute major coronary events). Baseline
triglyceride level (P = .98) and history of
diabetes (P = .34, 155 participants with
diabetes) were not significant predictors
of outcome. Within a factor, the numeri-
cal rate of first acute major coronary
events was similar among those treated
with lovastatin in the CHD positive-risk
subgroup and those treated with placebo
whodidnothavetheCHDriskfactor(eg,
lovastatin-treated smokers had rates
similar to placebo-treated nonsmokers).

events was numerically greater in wom-
en than in men (46% vs 37% reduction in
relative risk); however, the actual num-
ber of women who had a primary end
point event was small (20 of 997), and
there were no statistical differences in
treatment effects between sexes. None
of the subgroups differed significantly in
treatment benefit (eg, treatment benefit
wasnotdifferentforparticipantswithhy-
pertension compared with participants
withouthypertensionandbenefitwasnot
differentforsmokerscomparedwithnon-
smokers, since none of the treatment-by-
subgroup interactions were significant).
There were no significant interactions
between treatment and either LDL-C
(P = .99)orHDL-C(P = .16)whenevalu-
ated as continuous variables in a model
with the other associated covariates. No
threshold to benefit was observed in
LDL-C and HDL-C ranges studied.
In addition to the protocol-specified
rates that considered time to the first
event for withdrawn and active partici-
pants,wealsoanalyzedthetotalnumber
of events experienced by active and
withdrawn participants including mul-
tiple events of the same type (eg, mul-
tiplemyocardialinfarctionsexperienced
by a participant). There were 142 and
209 acute major coronary events in par-
ticipantstreatedwithlovastatinandpla-
cebo, respectively, with rates of 8 and
12 per 1000 patient-years, respectively.
There were 137 and 195 coronary revas-
cularizations (8 and 11 per 1000 patient-
years) in participants treated with lo-
vastatinandplacebo,respectively.Com-
bining acute major coronary events and
coronary revascularizations, there were
279 and 404 (16 and 23 per 1000 patient-
years) in the lovastatin and placebo
groups, respectively. If 1000 men and
women were treated with lovastatin for
5 years, approximately 19 acute major
coronary events (12 myocardial infarc-
tions and 7 presentations of unstable an-
gina)and17coronaryrevascularizations
could be prevented.
Tolerability and Safety
Overall, treatment with lovastatin
was well tolerated. Mortality and inci-
dence of fatal and nonfatal cancer (ter-
tiary end points to assess safety) did not
demonstrate any difference between
treatmentgroups.Theoverallmortality
rate was similar in each group, with 80
deaths among participants treated with
lovastatin and 77 deaths among partici-
pants treated with placebo (4.6 and 4.4
per 1000 patient-years in participants
treated with lovastatin and placebo, re-
spectively). The majority of deaths had
noncardiovascular causes. There were
17 deaths from cardiovascular causes
among participants treated with lova-
statin and 25 in the placebo group (1.0
and 1.4 per 1000 patient-years in lova-
statin and placebo groups, respectively)
and 63 deaths from noncardiovascular
causes among participants treated with
lovastatin and 52 in the placebo group
(3.6 and 3.0 per 1000 patient-years
among participants treated with lova-
statin and placebo, respectively). There
were 4 deaths from trauma, 3 in the pla-
cebo group and 1 in the lovastatin group.
The overall incidence of fatal and non-
fatalcancer,excludingnonmelanomaskin
cancers,was15.1and15.6per1000patient-
years (252 and 259 cases) among partici-
pants treated with lovastatin and pla-
cebo, respectively. The most frequently
reported tertiary end point cancers are
summarizedinTable4.Thenumberofpar-
ticipantsreportingnonmelanomaskincan-
cers,predominantlydiagnosesofbasalcell
andsquamouscellcancers,was250(7.6%)
in the lovastatin group and 243 (7.4%) in
the placebo group.
Thenumberofparticipantswithanyad-
verse experience that led to discontinua-
tion was 449 (13.6%) in the group treated
with lovastatin and 445 (13.8%) in the pla-
cebo group. Both treatment groups had
similar numbers of adverse experiences
that were considered serious (ie, life-
threatening, causing death or a perma-
nent disability, resulting in or prolonging
hospitalization, or diagnosis of any can-
cer), 1131 (34.2%) and 1126 (34.1%) in the
groups treated with lovastatin and pla-
cebo, respectively. One participant from
each treatment group was unblinded af-
ter discontinuation of the study drug and
before the end of the study. A placebo-
treatedpatient,whodiscontinuedtherapy
because of idiopathic hepatitis, was un-
blinded because a primary care physician
advised beginning lipid-reducing treat-
ment. Another participant was un-
blinded when he developed study drug­
related Stevens-Johnson syndrome after
approximately9monthsoftreatmentwith
lovastatin. Following appropriate treat-
ment and within 2 weeks of discontinuing
lovastatin use, this participant recov-
ered. No other lovastatin-related, life-
threatening, serious, adverse experi-
ences were reported.
Consecutive elevations of more than 3
times the upper limit of normal in either
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were
rare, and the incidence was similar in
bothtreatmentgroups(18[0.6%]of3242
participantsand11[0.3%]of3248receiv-
inglovastatinandplacebo,respectively).
(Notallparticipantshadpostrandomiza-
tion tests.) Examining these elevations
by final dose for those who were titrated
also revealed no significant trends. Con-
secutive elevations of more than 3 times

The number of participants with any

COMMENT
InAFCAPS/TexCAPS,treatmentwith
lovastatin resulted in a 37% reduction
(P.001) in the risk for first acute major
coronary events, defined as fatal or non-
fatal myocardial infarction, unstable an-
gina, or sudden cardiac death. The study
wasoriginallypoweredtodetecta30%dif-
ference between the treatment groups
after 320 participants had experienced a
primary event; however, the benefit af-
ter the second interim analysis (with 267
participants experiencing an event) was
ofsuchmagnitudethatthepredefinedcon-
ditions for stopping the study were met.
The differences between the 2 treatment
groupsappearedasearlyas1year(40par-
ticipantswitheventsintheplacebogroup
vs 23 treated with lovastatin).
Analysis of secondary end points con-
firmed that the composite primary end
point was representative of its compo-
nents:lovastatintherapysignificantlyre-
duced the risk for fatal or nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction by 40% and unstable
angina by 32%. Risk reduction with lo-
vastatin across the spectrum of cardio-
vascular events was further confirmed
by a 33% risk reduction in the need for
revascularizations (P = .001) and 25%
risk reductions in both total cardiovas-
cularandtotalcoronaryevents(P.006).
The number of deaths in AFCAPS/
TexCAPS was low (157 total deaths; 42
cardiovascular deaths, of which 26 were
CHD deaths), and as predicted,10 the
studywasnotadequatelypoweredtode-
tect treatment differences in the low fre-
quencyendpointsofcardiovascularmor-
tality and CHD mortality.

Primary end point risk reduction with
lovastatin was apparent across all base-
line LDL-C tertiles with no threshold
to benefit observed across baseline
LDL-C levels (range, 2.33-6.08 mmol/L
[90-235 mg/dL]). Benefit was also appar-
ent within subgroups, including women,
men older than the median age (57
years), women older than the median age
(62 years), and for participants with
additionalCHDriskfactors.Asobserved
in secondary prevention trials,6,7 female
AFCAPS/TexCAPS participants re-
sponded to treatment as well as, if not
betterthan,maleparticipants.Lovastatin
appeared to attenuate (Figure 4) the risk
conferred by sex, age, family history,
hypertension, smoking, LDL-C levels,
and below-average HDL-C levels.
AFCAPS/TexCAPS is, to our knowl-
edge,thefirstprimarypreventiontrialto
demonstrate risk reduction from lipid
modificationingenerallyhealthymenand
women without clinical evidence of car-
diovascular disease and with average TC
and LDL-C levels and below-average
HDL-Clevels.ThebaselinemeansforTC
andLDL-C(5.71mmol/L[221mg/dL]and
3.89mmol/L[150mg/dL],respectively)are
similar to the average levels for age- and
sex-matched individuals without cardio-
vasculardiseaseinNHANESIII.14 Mean
baseline HDL-C values (0.94 mmol/L
[36 mg/dL] for men and 1.03 mmol/L
[40mg/dL]forwomen)werebelowtheav-
erage for the NHANES III reference
population; however, the HDL-C range
for the cohort is 0.47 to 1.58 mmol/L
(18-61 mg/dL). Only 17% of AFCAPS/
TexCAPS participants would have met
current National Cholesterol Education
Program (NCEP) guidelines for drug
therapy (TC, 6.21 mmol/L [240 mg/dL];
LDL-C, 4.14 mmol/L [160 mg/dL]; and
2ormoreriskfactors)and32%wouldnot
have a fasting lipid profile measurement
by current NCEP guidelines (TC,
6.21 mmol/L [240 mg/dL] without 2 or
more risk factors).16
Earlier primary CHD prevention
studies included only middle-aged men
with very high TC and LDL-C con-
centrations.8,17,18 In the Lipid Research
Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention
Trial (LRC-CPPT),17 the upper age
limit was 59 years (mean age, 47.8
years), and the mean TC, LDL-C, and
HDL-Cconcentrationsatbaseline(prior
to diet therapy) were 7.55 mmol/L
(292 mg/dL), 5.59 mmol/L (216 mg/dL),
and 1.16 mmol/L (45 mg/dL), respec-
tively.IntheHelsinkiHeartStudy,18 the
upper age limit was 55 years (mean age,
47.3 years), and the mean baseline lipid
valuesforTC,LDL-C,andHDL-Cwere
6.98 mmol/L (270 mg/dL), 4.86 mmol/L
(188mg/dL),and1.22mmol/L(47mg/dL),
respectively. Likewise, the West of
Scotland Coronary Prevention Study
(WOSCOPS)8 waslimitedtomiddle-aged
men; the upper age limit was 64 years
(meanage,55.2years)andthemeanbase-
line lipid values for TC, LDL-C, and
HDL-C were 7.03 mmol/L (272 mg/dL),
4.97 mmol/L (192 mg/dL), and 1.14
mmol/L (44 mg/dL), respectively. All of
these trials reported statistically signifi-
cant reductions in the primary end point
of the combined incidence of nonfatal
myocardial infarction and CHD death;
the risk reductions were 19% in
LRC-CPPT,17 34% in the Helsinki Heart
Study,18 and 31% in WOSCOPS.8 Ex-
trapolation of the results of these 3 trials
ofmiddle-agedmenwithmoderate-to-se-
verehypercholesterolemiatothegeneral
population with lower TC and LDL-C
levels,towomen,andtoolderindividuals
has remained a matter of debate.19
Results from AFCAPS/TexCAPS are
consistent with findings from previous
primary prevention trials with high-risk
cohorts8,17,18; however, treatment with lo-
vastatin in AFCAPS/TexCAPS extends
thebenefittoalower-risksegmentofthe
general population. In contrast with ear-
lier studies, the AFCAPS/TexCAPS co-
hort included Hispanics, African Ameri-
cans, and older persons (baseline mean
age,58.2years;upperlimit,73years;21%
older than 65 years).15 The AFCAPS/
TexCAPS trial is also the first large-
scale primary prevention trial of LDL-C
reduction to include a substantial num-
ber of women (997 of the 6605 partici-
pants randomized). The cohort was also
generally healthy, with only 12% active
smokers, 22% with hypertension, and 2%
with diabetes.

while myocardial infarction, as the cause
for initial presentation, was decreasing.9
AFCAPS/TexCAPS data indicate that
approximatelyequalnumbersofpatients

nonfatal myocardial infarction.
The issue of safety and drug tolerance
isparticularlyimportantinprimarypre-
vention, where the risks of long-term
drug therapy must be considered in the
contextofachievablebenefit.AFCAPS/
TexCAPS provides long-term safety
data on a cohort treated up to 7 years
with lovastatin. The withdrawal rate
wascomparabletothatseeninotherpri-
marypreventiontrials,8,18 andfrequency
of withdrawal for adverse experiences
was similar in the treatment groups.
The results confirm and, by longer
treatment duration, extend those from
theExpandedClinicalEvaluationofLo-
vastatin (EXCEL) trial,20 in which 8245
participants were studied for 1 year
using regimens representative of the
entire lovastatin dosage range. Both
EXCEL and AFCAPS/TexCAPS dem-
onstrated no cases of lovastatin-induced
myopathy, no significant differences
between treatment with lovastatin,
20 mg/d, and placebo in the number of
participants experiencing clinically im-
portant elevations in transaminase con-
centrations (3 times the upper limit of
normal) and CK elevations (10 times the
upper limit of normal). Furthermore,

The AFCAPS/TexCAPS results in-
dicate that cholesterol reduction with
lovastatin for men and women with
average TC and LDL-C levels could po-
tentially improve quality of life by ex-
tending CHD event-free survival and
conserving invasive treatments. The
economic impact of treatment requires
resource utilization analyses that con-
sider the cost of long-term treatment,
hospitalization, and the cost of diagnos-
tic and therapeutic intervention.
Thesefindingssupportandextendthe
recommendations of the NCEP to in-
clude HDL-C in addition to TC in initial
risk-factor assessment, target LDL-C
reductionastheprimarygoaloftherapy,
and, if necessary, titrate treatment to
achieve an LDL-C goal level. The ben-
efit seen in all subgroups and across
all tertiles of LDL-C in AFCAPS/
TexCAPS occurred with 25% LDL-C
reduction and suggests that treatment
with lovastatin could be considered in
asymptomatic participants at relatively
low risk for CHD and with average
TC and LDL-C levels (3.36 mmol/L
[130mg/dL])andbelow-averageHDL-C
levels (1.29 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]).
AFCAPS/TexCAPS demonstrates
thatlovastatin,20to40mg/d,canreduce
the risk for first acute major coronary
events in men and women with average
or mildly elevated TC and LDL-C levels
and below-average HDL-C levels.
Using NHANES III survey data,14,15
approximately8millionAmericanswith-
out documented cardiovascular disease
meet the age and lipid criteria of
AFCAPS/TexCAPS. Assuming that
only 17% of the reference population
would qualify for drug treatment by
current NCEP guidelines, we estimate
that 6 million Americans currently not
recommended for drug treatment may
benefit from LDL-C reduction with
lovastatin. These results support the in-
clusion of HDL-C measurement in initial
risk-factor assessment and suggest reas-
sessment of NCEP guidelines regarding
pharmacological intervention.
