Introduction
Research methodologies for the exploration of traditional,
complementary, and alternative medicines (TCAM) are
developing in ways congruent with Indigenous science and
traditional knowledge systems. These emergent research
approaches are not necessarily exclusive of Western scien-
tifically oriented methods (Jones, Ingham, Cram, Dean, &
Davies, 2013; Te Karu, Bryant, & Elley, 2013). They do,
however, require adaptation and interrogation of method-
ological impact upon participants and Indigenous peoples
(Durie, 2004). Effective application of integrated methodol-
ogies requires consideration of cultural sensitivity and cross-
cultural reliability for the reconciliation of academic research
priorities with diverse participant realities (Saini, 2012).
Tension is evident for researchers balancing representation
of participants' realities and the need to conform to conven-
tionality and rationality of "acceptable" Western science­
based research protocols (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014; Ritenbaugh
et al., 2008). The power embedded in the underlying philoso-
phy of research methodologies must be acknowledged (Carr,
2002). Furthermore, if comparisons are to be made between
health systems grounded in divergent worldviews, with con-
trasting definitions of well-being (Connor, 2012), research-
ers must possess expertise in the system being studied as
well as in the research methods being applied (Durie, 2004).
The potential for revelation of insights from TCAM and
Indigenous knowledge systems is being limited by polarized
views of legitimacy and validity between research paradigms
(Durie, 2004; Murthy, 2010). Applying Western scientific
"rules" of research can act as a control mechanism and risk
the assimilation of traditional knowledge, under the guise of
facilitating "legitimate" discourse (Saini, 2012). Indigenous
science provides empirical evidence, gathered over the cen-
turies and sustained by oral or codified traditions, that is
already available to look to for insights (Winkelman, 2009).
Literature included in this synthesis indicates recent research
in TCAM, and Indigenous healing is less interested in find-
ing new information. Rather, it seeks to validate what those
systems already know and to translate that knowledge into
language and measures that can be understood according to
Western science (Chacko, 2003; Joshi, 2004).
TCAM encompasses knowledge of healing systems from
around the globe, including Indigenous medicine traditions
(Hollenburg, Zakus, Cook, & Xu, 2008).These healing systems

Bridging Indigenous and Western
Sciences: Research Methodologies
for Traditional, Complementary, and
Alternative Medicine Systems
Amy Massey1 and Ray Kirk1
Abstract
Emergent research methodologies congruent with Indigenous knowledge and worldviews are providing access to insights
from traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine, including Indigenous healing systems. Tension is evident for
researchers balancing representation of Indigenous realities with expectation to conform to the conventionality and rationality
of "acceptable" Western science­based research protocols. Where past research pursuits have been limited by polarized
views of legitimacy and validity, Western science and Indigenous science are now converging as equally valid notions of
science to guide emergent research practices such as Kaupapa Mori. This narrative synthesis explores complex relations
between epistemology, methodology, and practice. It aims to contribute to the transfer of knowledge between Indigenous
and Western scientific paradigms.

provide ancient and living knowledge of therapeutic strate-
gies for health based on the experiences of culturally or geo-
graphically defined groups. Examples include Ayurveda
and yoga, the traditional healing systems of India, and tradi-
tional Chinese medicine (TCM) (Patwardhan, Warude,
Pushpangadan, & Bhatt, 2005). Indigenous healing systems
have roots in various Indigenous cultures (Winkelman,
2009).Although they shareTCAM classification (Hollenburg
et al., 2008), Indigenous medicine systems are uniquely
characterized by oral traditions, distinct languages, the
importance of community, and the view that human health is
interconnected with the earth (Robbins & Dewar, 2011). The
example included in this article is Rongoa Mori, traditional
Mori medicine in Aotearoa, New Zealand (McGowan,
2009). In many places around the globe, TCAM remain the
most accessible systems of health care. Although the bio-
medical system is dominant in New Zealand and other colo-
nized, Westernized countries, TCAM coexist--even though
biomedicine has questioned and, in some cases, discounted
their efficacy. The resultant state of medical pluralism is
common to modern societies (Winkelman, 2009).
The role of research in TCAM, including Indigenous
healing traditions, is debated (Durie, 2004; Coulter, Lewith,
Khorsan, Kirk, & Mittman, 2014; Shukla & Gardner, 2006).
With increasing rates of acceptance and use (Coulter et al.,
2014; Kumar, Bajaj, & Mehrotra, 2006), research validating
effectiveness and safety of TCAM is important. Not only
does it assure the protection of its users, it also holds poten-
tial to reveal greater knowledge and resources for health. The
question for researchers is how to both evaluate evidence of
healing capacity and access the fullest meaning of data gath-
ered from distinct worldviews (Coulter et al., 2014).
This article explores the interface between TCAM and
Western science, with a narrative synthesis of emergent and
Indigenous research approaches for the investigation of
whole systems of healing. This narrative synthesis works to
bridge discourses by demonstrating the potentiality, applica-
bility, and credibility of research methodologies representa-
tive of distinct worldviews. It acts as yet another strand in the
weaving of knowledge across typical discipline and sector
boundaries (Chacko, 2003). Ultimately, this synthesis aims
to make a contribution to the transfer of knowledge between
Indigenous and Western scientific paradigms (Saini, 2012)
for the enrichment of health practices and greater choice in
health care.
Background
"Research is methodology." Methodology guides the way
research questions are applied in the field, allowing the
researcher to make statements about the significance of results
or outcomes (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002). Methodology,
therefore, provides the rationale for methods used to produce
"valid" knowledge. Knowledge is considered valid only if it is
produced in ways conforming to methods prescribed by a
chosen research methodology. Methodology claims a knowl-
edge of its own in asserting certain procedures. An aptly
selected methodology will justify decisions of the researcher
and prove necessity of researcher actions. While research
methods are justified by the methodology, the methodology
is justified by an underlying philosophy. Access to the func-
tions of methodology, from conception of research questions
to drawing of conclusions, is provided by exploration of rela-
tionships between the methodology's philosophy and the
researched subject. There is immense power in the philoso-
phy of methodology that is assumed superior in its ability to
judge and validate claims to truth made by the research sub-
ject (Carr, 2002). Truth is an ever-evolving creation (Cajete,
2004). To look beyond current knowledge, a researcher must
develop capacity to see their subject through different lenses.
This is the place for new methodology, seeking not only evi-
dence but also meaning from the data (Clough & Nutbrown,
2002).
In its broadest sense, the Latin root of science, scientia,
means knowledge. The term Western science has been used
with a degree of exclusivity since the 20th century to refer to
officially sanctioned knowledge of positivist inquiry, sup-
ported and acknowledged by governing bodies. As a domi-
nant, global system of knowledge, Western science has
served as a basis for research investigating efficacy and
effectiveness of health care, including Indigenous and
TCAM healing practices. Aspects of knowledge from
Indigenous healing and traditional medicine systems may
conflict with the rationale of Western science or may be mis-
understood in codified or highly metaphoric oral information
systems. But that does not make this knowledge unscientific.
Rather, it makes it scientific knowledge of a different kind
(Snively & Corsiglia, 1998). Indigenous science is empirical
knowledge founded in processes of revelation, traditional
teachings, and empirical observation in real-life settings over
time (Lavallee, 2009). Snively and Corsiglia (1998) defined
Indigenous science as relative to both scientific knowledge
of long-time resident, usually oral-culture, populations (as in
Indigenous healing traditions), and scientific knowledge of
persons within a society, affected by the interests and world-
views of their own community (as in TCAM). Traditional
ecological knowledge is a richly documented example of
Indigenous science. It also serves as an example of an
Indigenous science being "rediscovered" by Western science
researchers, looking to traditional local knowledge which
Western Science claims to legitimize, in endeavors such as
bioprospecting (Battiste & Henderson, 2000). Binary discus-
sions of Western science and Indigenous science are now
converging as significant Indigenous knowledge is tran-
scribed and acknowledged as equally valid according to rela-
tivist, rather than universal, notions of science (Snively &
Corsiglia, 2001).
Nonetheless, the application of research methodologies in
concordance withWestern scientific criteria can lead research-
ers to draw conclusions according to Eurocentric scientific
Massey and Kirk 3
thinking. Indigenous and culturally derived traditional
knowledge has its own distinct philosophies and understand-
ings of health. Rationalization of this knowledge for coinci-
dence with Western scientific principles is taking data out of
its true context, rendering it meaningless in the absence of
the overarching principles of knowledge. Indigenous knowl-
edge cannot be sufficiently assessed by Western scientific
criteria alone (Durie, 2004). Tuhiwai-Smith (1999) identified
Indigenous research as a site of struggle between Indigenous
knowing and Western interests. Tuhiwai-Smith (1999) fur-
ther noted injustices of colonization and research for their
significant impacts upon Indigenous populations, regulating
and realizing an underlying code of imperialism with scien-
tific paradigms, scholarly disciplines, and the individuals
and institutions supporting them. It is significant to
acknowledge that practices that constitute folk medicine in
one society may in fact represent professional practice in
another, according to differences in local power structures
(Winkelman, 2009).
Considerable numbers of people use complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM) in both developing and devel-
oped nations, many of them well educated (Chacko, 2003;
Winkelman, 2009). As attitudes are changing so too health
services are changing. At one time competing and marginal-
ized, doctors are now training in modalities such as acupunc-
ture and herbal medicine; holistic health professionals are
integrating use of stethoscopes and practicing alongside
medical practitioners; and, Indigenous frameworks are being
introduced for provision of more holistic, culturally compe-
tent care. Thus, the distinction between biomedical and com-
plementary health sectors is no longer absolute (Winkelman,
2009).
There are calls for further scientific research documenting
clinical evidence of efficacy to support access to and utiliza-
tion of complementary and alternative practices alongside
biomedical practices (Wellcome Trust, 2000). There is also
already a multitude of other information sources providing
"clinical" evidence already in existence; for example, identi-
fiable patterns in long-standing traditional use, similar appli-
cations in various areas of the world, and congruencies found
between pharmacological, biomedical properties of healing
agents, and the pathophysiology of disease (Winkelman,
2009). The development of research methodologies can sup-
port a fuller understanding of TCAM and Indigenous prac-
tices as whole systems of healing and the place for these
modalities in provision of modern health services.
Objectives
This article presents a narrative synthesis that identifies and
compares methodologies used in the evaluation of traditional
healing practices. In considering the aim(s), suitability, and
validity of each approach, contributions can be made to the
interpretation of research findings for maximum receptivity
to learnings brought to light in a meeting ground between
two distinct worldviews (Popay et al., 2006).
Method of Synthesis
Following the protocol guidance of Popay and colleagues
(2006), this article provides a narrative synthesis of articles
applying either or both Indigenous and Western research
methodologies to evaluate effectiveness of various healing
approaches. From the synthesis, this article also considers
the potential for transference of findings between knowledge
systems.
Popay and colleagues (2006) described narrative synthe-
sis as a form of trustworthy story telling. Just as story telling
is central to the sustaining and transmission of knowledge
among Indigenous cultures, the nature of this narrative syn-
thesis aims to bring evidence together to tell a story about
long-established practices and newly determining research
approaches for the sharing of knowledge that can enrich
health systems and health care practices.
Four main elements of a narrative synthesis detailed in the
general framework provided by Popay and colleagues (2006)
and relevant to this research involve theorizing how, why,
and for whom certain research methodologies work; organiz-
ing a preliminary synthesis of research findings; looking for
relationships within the data; and assessing the robustness of
the data and the data synthesis. First, the lead author sur-
veyed studies considering whether or not the research inter-
ventions achieved objectives, for whom they were effective,
and why they may have been effective. This initial survey of
the data enabled selection of studies utilizing a range of
methodologies and preliminary assessment of applicability
for this narrative synthesis. Next, factors seen to be facilitat-
ing research implementation or acting as barriers in imple-
mentation were identified and organized thematically for
further exploration. These relationships in the data were then
investigated to understand why and how the research was
undertaken and why the interventions had an effect, if any.
Findings have been expanded upon for generalizability and
relevance in different contexts.
Appropriately, the protocol for narrative synthesis does
not rely upon any one authoritative system of knowledge or
rigorously tested techniques. However, as the Cochrane
handbook (Higgins & Green, 2011) highlights, it is possible
such a narrative approach to the synthesis of data may be
prone to bias or generate unsound conclusions. These prob-
lems are not limited to narrative synthesis. Statistical tech-
niques can equally produce misleading results and may also
be reported with bias, as this synthesis later demonstrates.
Somewhat aligned with the motivation for this synthesis,
there is also a need for methodological strengthening of this
narrative technique. The authors have aimed to address this
need by way of application of Popay and colleagues' (2006)
guidance.

Study Selection
Atotal of 14 articles were included in the primary synthesis and
appraisal of research quality, considered together with exten-
sive supplementary reading of background information and
articles related to content of the studies. The retrieval strategy
for studies to be included involved electronic bibliographic
database searches of EMBASE and MEDLINE, generating
304 and 12 studies, respectively. The search returned articles
reporting research in multifarious modalities broadly classified
as CAM. Only those studies with specific reference to healing
practices with Indigenous or cultural origins in long-established
traditional knowledge systems were included. Acknowledging
the diversity and depth of Indigenous and TCAM healing tradi-
tions, the authors have focused on four systems, including
Rongoa,Ayurveda, yoga, and TCM. The selection of these sys-
tems is based on, and limited by, the authors' relevant training
and familiarity with these traditional medicine systems. Further
limits were applied to source articles using human participants,
published since the year 2000, and reported in English lan-
guage. The search criteria used for both databases was
([Complementary medicine or alternative medicine] or [tradi-
tional medicine or Indigenous medicine] or [integrative medi-
cine]) AND ([qualitative research] or [quantitative study] or
[methodology or mixed methods])AND ([Ayurveda] or [yoga]
or [Rongoa] or [Chinese medicine]). It was necessary to sup-
plement these database searches with the use of Google Scholar
to find research articles representative of Kaupapa Mori
approaches. Resources from relevant websites, such as the
World Health Organization and Association of Ayurvedic
Professionals, and resources provided by University of
Canterbury teaching staff were also examined for relevant
content.
Each of the studies selected evaluates TCAM healing
practices and/or the associated healing experience. Articles
were chosen to represent diverse research methodologies uti-
lizing either or both Indigenous scientific research designs
and/or Western scientific research standards, making it pos-
sible to consider compatibility of methods and transfer of
learnings between knowledge systems (Saini, 2012).
With methodological, observational, and analytical con-
tributions from fields of anthropology, geography, biology,
conservation, education, social science, history, and public
and clinical health, the research reviewed in this article is
evidence of the multidisciplinary expertise culminating in
emergent methodologies for research in TCAM and
Indigenous healing systems. Its relevance reaches far beyond
health and political sectors. Its primary impact is upon the
people to whom this knowledge belongs, the Indigenous
communities of our world, and its potential impact is for the
health of all people. The purpose and positionality of each
research article is examined with reference to these wider
perspectives. Certain characteristics of researchers' method-
ological choices are discussed, making explicit connections
between methodological assumptions, relevance of data, and
the obtaining of multiple meaning from the data (with use of
interpretive analyses and researcher-led reporting).
Findings
Research Methodologies
A multiscience perspective (Ogawa, 1995) is valuable when
considering suitability of research methodologies. With
access to two systems of knowledge, researchers investigat-
ing TCAM, and especially Indigenous healing, must bridge
any "divide" between Western scientific and Indigenous sci-
entific paradigms (see "Background" section; Durie, 2004).
Determining a valid research design is fundamental. At polar
ends of the debate, the position of researchers trained in bio-
medical methodologies may consider knowledge as valid
only when it is verified in a randomized double-blind, con-
trolled trial. Whereas critics of biomedical methodologies
maintain that evaluation of traditional medicines according
to concepts of biomedicine may fail to produce true knowl-
edge, owing to a dependence on scientific vocabulary and
design criteria representative of imperialistic, Westernized
ways of thinking (Tilburt & Kaptchuk, 2008). It may be sig-
nificant to recognize many Indigenous people living in
developed countries are already living in the divide, informed
by both Western science and Indigenous science. There
within may be the greatest opportunity for innovation: allow-
ing each system its own integrity while developing research
approaches that incorporate elements of both for maximum
relevance and creation of new knowledge (Durie, 2004).
Recent studies (Jones et al., 2013; Shukla & Gardner, 2006;
Te Karu et al., 2013) reveal a new frame of thinking indica-
tive of a coming together of Indigenous and Western scien-
tific bodies of knowledge, sustaining credibility of both
worldviews (Durie, 2004).
Western Science­Based Methodologies
The World Health Organization's (2002) First Global
Strategy on Traditional and Alternative Medicine supports
clinical research and evaluation of traditional medicine's
efficacy in treating certain diseases while also acknowledg-
ing challenges of incomparable methodologies and termi-
nologies. Comparative examination of health practices may
be helpful in determining safety, efficacy, and cost-effective-
ness of different treatments (Durie, 2004; Winkelman, 2009).
Three of the studies included in this narrative synthesis used
Western science­based randomized trials to evaluate
Indigenous healing practices either exclusively, in compari-
son or combination with biomedical approaches. Although
the chosen methodology is consistent, in actuality, there is
variance in application of the methodology.
Kligler and colleagues (2011) assessed yoga as a comple-
mentary strategy in an integrative treatment for asthma among
154 adults (77 treatment, 77 control). Their randomized trial
Massey and Kirk 5
evaluated combined effectiveness of an integrated, lifestyle-
oriented treatment program in clinical status as well as qual-
ity of life (QoL).Adouble-blind control protocol was deemed
impractical and unethical, making a rigorous study design a
challenge. However the multicomponent treatment plan with
lifestyle orientation was considered to have maximum appli-
cability to the real-life experience of living with asthma. The
results of this study are particularly noteworthy for the vari-
ance in outcomes between measures. Clinical testing of pul-
monary function tests revealed no change. However,
statistical analysis of the QoL survey showed both overall
and disease-specific QoL improved significantly. These
results indicate improvements are mediated by mechanisms
not physiologically attributable to effects on airway inflam-
mation (Kligler et al., 2011).
As the first clinical trial of its kind, Ritenbaugh et al.
(2008) researched TCM as an individualized, whole system
approach to treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders
and compared outcomes with naturopathy and standard care
options. Whole systems research aims to maintain theoretical
congruency with the system of medicine being investigated.
Treatments were not provided in isolation, rather within a
framework that fostered development of health-enhancing
behaviors, including dietary habits, exercise, and stress
release practices. Subjective reports were quantified using
linearly interpolated values. Standard care, naturopathy, and
TCM groups all reported positive change, though TCM pro-
vided most effective pain relief. Divergent of the classical
gold standard of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), the
study was limited by sample size with 160 randomized
patients, inconsistencies in treatment duration between
groups, and changes made to reduce participant burden and
provide rapid pain relief. However, as the first study of its
kind, the authors are quick to point out the exploratory nature
of the research and the greater importance of providing guid-
ance for future studies as opposed to rigorous adherence to
methodology.
In contrast, Macklin et al. (2006) focused exclusively on
acupuncture, as an aspect of TCM. Macklin and colleagues
(2006) emphasized soundness and validity of research
based on a large sample size and rigorous adherence to both
research methodology and TCM principles. Three groups
were provided acupuncture treatment, using the following:
acupuncture points individualized according to TCM diag-
nosis; preselected, standardized acupuncture points; or
sham points not correlated with acupuncture points. Despite
variable changes in blood pressure recorded for all groups
throughout treatment duration, Macklin et al. (2006)
reported no significant benefits for individualized or stan-
dardized treatment versus sham acupuncture. For all the
reported validity of the methodology, the researcher's
application does not fit with recent recommendations for
study in the maturing field of acupuncture research,
requiring either application of whole system interventions
or a more mechanistic focus to understand how each
treatment component translates into a physiological out-
come (Langevin et al., 2011).
Indigenous Science­Based Methodologies
Indigenous research methodologies are predicated on the
legitimacy and validity of Indigenous knowledge and philoso-
phy, including language and culture (Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999).
Beliefs of participants are not only protected, they are also
endorsed in the research process (Durie, 2004). The applica-
tion of Indigenous science for the conduction of research will
necessarily vary according to local teachings and cultural tra-
ditions (Lavallee, 2009).At the heart of this research paradigm
is connectedness and relationality, ensuring accountability of
researchers and application of research outcomes for the good
of those participating (Durie, 2004; Tuhiwai-Smith, 1999).
Kaupapa Mori is one such research approach (Jones
et al., 2013; Te Karu et al., 2013). Mori are tangata whenua
of Aotearoa, New Zealand (Health Research Council [HRC]
of New Zealand, 2010). In accordance with Te Tiriti o
Waitangi and in acknowledgment of disproportionately neg-
ative health and well-being statistics, Mori participation and
prioritization in health research is critical (HRC of New
Zealand, 2010). Kaupapa Mori research is affirming the
genuine need to seek traditional knowledge as a way of
understanding and as a basis for creative solution finding to
the health crisis facing Mori today. It involves development
of distinctively Mori philosophies and frameworks to
inform academic work, which will in turn enhance Mori
potentiality. Te Ao Mori (Mori worldview) and Te Reo
(Mori language) possess a vast knowledge that can be
drawn upon to effect change in health care and empower-
ment of Mori. Mori health organizations operating in com-
munity and iwi capacities already affirm the need to reclaim
and more fully understand use of traditional healing (Reinfeld
& Pihama, 2007). Application of Kaupapa Mori research
methods can enhance the quality of research and outcomes,
ensuring research contributes to Mori health development.
Consultation, use of Te Reo, and upholding of Mori cultural
concepts forms the foundation for cooperative relationships
between researchers and Mori groups. In particular, cultural
concepts of health and well-being must be affirmed and pro-
tected by the research process, encompassing Te Ao Mori,
whakapapa (genealogy), tikanga (custom), te taha wairua
(spiritual elements), taha whanau (family and community),
taha tinana (physical elements), and taha hinengaro (emo-
tional, psychological elements) (HRC of New Zealand,
2010). In the wake of colonial encroachment and disposses-
sion, recognizing the impacts of historical and present-day
sociopolitical context, and acknowledging importance of
place and relationships are central to achieving hauora (opti-
mal health, as defined by Mori) (Reinfeld & Pihama, 2007).
The significance of relatedness among researchers, par-
ticipants, and their respective roles in communities was a
theme repeatedly represented in the research of Te Karu and
6 SAGE Open
colleagues (2013). Using an inductive qualitative approach
guided by principles of Kaupapa Mori methodology, Te
Karu et al. (2013) interviewed 12 Mori with gout using sem-
istructured interviews to ascertain understanding, perception,
and treatment of gout. Use of Kaupapa methodology added
richness to the data gathered, consulting with health provid-
ers, local iwi, and local Mori leaders to gain unanimous sup-
port for the project. Recognition of matauranga Mori (Mori
knowledge) and Te Ao Mori was upheld with use of open-
ended questions in interviews, with most korero (discussion)
conducted in participant's homes. Findings revealing over-
whelming sufferance, feelings of self-blame and presumed
blame of others brought to light the importance of connec-
tions with people for wellness (Te Karu et al., 2013).
Working at the Interface
Scientific methodologies and Indigenous methodologies are
no longer distinct. Protocols can be and are being adjusted
for research work that synchronizes Eurocentric scientific
protocol with Indigenous scientific knowledge. Durie (2004)
suggested working at the interface, identifying meeting
grounds common to both paradigms and working toward the
same goal of health. As protocols are amended and new
methods are developed in approaches upholding of
Indigenous beliefs, enthusiasm for participation can increase
(Durie, 2004; Jones et al., 2013). More than any explanation,
the experience of researching divergent worldviews or
knowledge systems is engaging the interest of Western sci-
ence-trained researchers and enabling, for example,
researcher participation and reporting in customary ceremo-
nies or rituals. As well as enriching researcher understand-
ing, participation is changing researcher attitudes too (Durie,
2004; Jones et al., 2013; Shukla & Gardner, 2006).
Research Methods
Tilburt and Kaptchuk (2008) noted that "All research should
hold the potential to achieve social value. Different entities
may view the social value of traditional medicine research
differently" (p. 579). Although research interests in knowl-
edge production differ from practical interests of communi-
ties, emerging research now demonstrates mutuality in the
contribution to and benefit from the research (Wallerstein &
Duran, 2006). Local Indigenous and traditional knowledge is
being revealed, sustained, and in some instances grown in
theapplicationofparticipatoryresearchmethods.Community
members are empowered, enabled, and better resourced as an
outcome of research that is providing opportunities to give
voice and share personal stories (Jones et al., 2013; Shukla &
Gardner, 2006; Te Karu et al., 2013).
Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)
A collaborative research orientation focuses on relationships
between academic researchers and community members, with
mutual learning opportunities for mutual benefit. A long-term
commitment enables incorporation of community knowledge,
encourages participation, and integrates community practices
within the research process. CBPR has emerged as an inte-
grated set of research methods using social action and educa-
tion for improved health and reduction of health disparities.As
CBPR has matured over recent decades, tensions have been
raised surrounding the challenge of mutuality in research rela-
tionships. Some of the issues inherent to the dynamic and
evolving context of research founded upon researcher­
community relationships include power, privilege, discrimi-
nation, consent, participation, and the ability to affect social
change (Wallerstein & Duran, 2006). Yet efficacy of methods
central to CBPR is affirmed by multiple studies considered
in this review (Jones et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2006; Shukla
& Gardner, 2006; Te Karu et al., 2013).
Community and Place
Numerous research articles in this narrative synthesis dem-
onstrated usefulness of community-based research
approaches in combining local healing knowledge with for-
malized systems of medicine. In a community-based research
project, Shukla and Gardner (2006) demonstrated the impor-
tance of a community setting for exploration of connections
with place and people for healing. Local knowledge was
grown with community education sessions and resources
were shared to foster backyard revitalization of endangered
plants native to the area. Te Karu et al. (2013) found differ-
ences in care seeking behavior and treatments between rural
and urban communities, reiterating the importance of place
as the location for healing and, therefore, the importance of
place in health research (Shukla & Gardner, 2006; Te Karu
et al., 2013). Working in a community hospital, Kumar et al.
(2006) found friends and neighbors were the most common
source of CAM knowledge for the treatment of diabetes. In
Te Karu et al.'s (2013) study, one participant explicitly rec-
ommended local marae-based services for improved access
to and more timely provision of culturally appropriate care.
Notably, Rongoa was found to play a significant role in the
lives of those living rurally, where seven of eight rural par-
ticipants used Rongoa as part of their daily routine to treat
gout, physically and spiritually.
Power
As with Kaupapa Mori approaches, the central aim of health
in CBPR is attained by way of committing to reciprocal
researcher­community relationships (Jones et al., 2013).
Power relations exist between the researcher and participants
(Clough & Nutbrown, 2002). There is authority and power
vested in those who are in possession of the methodology,
with its underlying worldview (Royal, 2005). Important ques-
tions must be asked when researching the voice of others.
Who is listening to the participants? Why are they listening to
the participants? In whose interests are they listening? How
Massey and Kirk 7
well is the participant able to articulate intentions and effec-
tively tell his or her own story (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002)?
The potential for full disclosure, meaningful discourse, and
sharing of life stories can be limited between people with dif-
ferent worldviews, outlook, interests, and power, as it can be
difficult for one another to step outside of their entrenched
perspectives (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002; Durie, 2004). In
particular, it can be difficult to elicit voices from those who
have been marginalized or disempowered as "other."
Participatory Partnerships
Collaborative partnership is a primary requirement in inter-
national research ethics. Partners in research collaborations
must share vocabulary to ensure social value and scientific
validity (Tilburt & Kaptchuk, 2008). For Mori community
health providers involved with Te Karu et al.'s (2013)
research team, developing a meaningful, long-term partner-
ship with a research institute resulted in opportunities to give
voice to community health issues previously unheard.
Incorporating the voices of the researcher as well as partici-
pants can be positional, political, and persuasive (Clough &
Nutbrown, 2002). Community-based research by Shukla and
Gardner (2006) in India, gave voice to community members,
articulating with high persuasion the potential of their local
knowledge, the place of vaidus (local healers) in health care,
and the resources available naturally in their environment.
Articulation of community voice was all the more persuasive
with botany experts and outside researchers validating and
recognizing the significance of local knowledge. Enabling
articulation of a group that has been historically marginal-
ized is now affecting change in government and biomedical
structures of domination, as seen in environmental resource
management and documentation of vaidu knowledge.
Storytelling
People appreciate an opportunity to share their story, to be
listened to and understood (Jones et al., 2013; Shukla &
Gardner, 2006; Te Karu et al., 2013).
As Seidman (1991) noted,
Telling stories is essentially a meaning-making process. When
people tell stories, they select details from their stream of
consciousness . . . It is this process of selecting constitutive
details of experience, reflecting on them, giving them order, and
thereby making sense of them that makes telling stories a
meaning-making experience. (p. 1, as cited in Clough &
Nutbrown, 2002, p. 77)
Use of clinical rhetoric was identified as an issue in inter-
views conducted by Te Karu et al. (2013). There is a differ-
ence between rhetoric, utilized in clinical settings and policy
processes alike, and reality as experienced by an individual
(Pihama, Cram, & Walker, 2002). Rhetoric can reflect limita-
tions in cultural competence and restricted understanding. In
Te Karu et al.'s (2013) case, it also suggests the skill of the
researcher listening more than merely hearing what is famil-
iar. Where an uninformed researcher may have unconsciously
missed this opportunity for insight, Te Karu and colleagues
(2013), as Mori researchers sharing a relationship with par-
ticipants and understanding of their circumstances, were able
to steer and contribute to dialogue to give real voice to partici-
pants (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002). Participant recommenda-
tions for marae-based services came from their wanting to
facilitate dialogue for better understanding of the doctors and
pharmacists. Regardless of whether information was pro-
vided by health professionals, participants did not feel it was
understandable nor did participants feel understood. Among
Te Karu and colleagues' (2013) interviewees, none had
knowledge of alternate treatment options even though most
were unsatisfied with pharmaceutical treatment that formed
the basis of their symptomatic relief of gout.
Relationships
Relationships formed by bringing people together in a
research process can be healing in themselves. Participants
in Jones and colleagues' (2013) Kaupapa Mori research felt
understood by Jones's ability to identify with Mori perspec-
tives, having shared experiences of asthma, and as a mother.
Face-to-face interaction was pivotal to the cultural frame-
work for extended fieldwork, which required researchers to
know the community and be known by the community. Jones
et al. (2013) also observed the way in which collective expe-
riences fitted together (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002), using
photovoice and drawings as an additional medium of articu-
lation for parents and children. For researchers involved in
transcribing and thematic analysis, the additional mediums
were also helpful for coding as participants' articulation was
not always as clear in narrative text as it was implicit in the
understanding between interviewer and participant.
Gathering the Data
Kumar et al. (2006) selected 493 study participants by sys-
tematic sampling of 6,094 diabetes patients accessing a hos-
pital outpatient endocrine clinic in Allahabad, India.
Investigating knowledge and practice of CAM, including
Ayurveda, homoeopathy, naturopathy, acupressure, and oth-
ers, their study found that 71% of hospital attendees were
aware of CAM treatment options. Furthermore, 95% of those
with awareness of CAM treatments were using CAM as a dia-
betes treatment. Quick, additional relief lowering blood sugar,
low cost, and availability were main reasons for using CAM,
with data suggesting effectiveness and user satisfaction
among 45% of CAM users were driving CAM use. Discussion
of statistical analysis went so far as to suggest higher use of
CAM could reflect dissatisfaction with allopathic treatment
options, though it also concluded few participants were satis-
fied with CAM use exclusively. Generalizability of Kumar
8 SAGE Open
and colleagues' (2006) sample is compromised as the study
took place within a biomedical hospital setting, hence sam-
ple selection risks interaction with traits inherent to that pop-
ulation (Krageloh, 2008). In this instance, a survey among
patients utilizing a specialized endocrine clinic for medical
treatment of diabetes may not represent practices prevalent
in wider populations. Community-based studies are needed
to reveal actual usage patterns (Kumar et al., 2006).
Purposeful sampling was used in Slocum-Gori, Howard,
Balneaves, and Kazanjian's (2013) research, inviting health
care providers to participate in focus groups regarding imple-
mentation of a yoga therapy program. The group participat-
ing is therefore neither guaranteed to be a representative
sample, nor are their comments necessarily generalizable.
However, they do provide a collective viewpoint. Validity
and generalizability are limited with groups assembled spe-
cifically for the purposes of research. Issues can be exacer-
bated when data are then analyzed and interpreted by
researchers removed from the interview process (Clough &
Nutbrown, 2002), as identified in the separate coding pro-
cess undertaken by researchers removed from interviews in
Jones et. al.'s (2013) research. Slocum-Gori and colleagues
(2013) aimed to minimize such issues in an analysis process
that combined focus group observation, an initial coding
scheme, and refinement of thematic categories. Looking to
education methodology, the authors found room for further
methodological development. Focused conversations (as
opposed to focus groups) can create a dynamic that is more
allowing of contribution, reflection, reshaping, and rephras-
ing in the group process of conversing. In focused conversa-
tions, when the participating group are not only the data
source but also analysts and coauthors of the research, issues
of misinterpretation during data analysis are minimized
(Clough & Nutbrown, 2002).
Interpreting the Data
Interpretive approaches have limitations. It may be that par-
ticipants are required to make sense of their own experiences
for the first time, at the time they are explaining them to the
interviewer. Interviewers and researchers coding transcripts
then have to interpret each participant and make sense of the
participants' description of their experience. Jones et al.
(2013) used interpretive phenomenological analysis as an
inductive qualitative research technique for narrative analy-
sis. Their analysis was grounded in the participants own
articulation and sense-making. In the case of Jones's research,
the researchers coding interview dialogue were not the inter-
viewers. Removed from the cultural and social context of the
community, those researchers coding data (by the author's
own admittance) struggled to interpret full meaning of the
data from transcripts alone. Although Jones et al. (2013)
attempted to maintain validity by showing interviewees tran-
scripts for feedback, layers of interpretive processes can
affect accuracy of reporting.
Interpretation of research data is not limited to qualitative
research. Kligler and colleagues' (2011) randomized experi-
mental study of integrative care for asthma involved statisti-
cal analysis of QoL surveys and clinical pulmonary function
data. In addition to yoga and yogic breathing exercises, the
treatment plan also offered nutrition advice, supplements and
food elimination, and encouraged personal journaling. Group
yoga sessions made treatments more cost-effective and pro-
vided social interaction with others experiencing similar life-
style changes. In such a complex, whole systems intervention,
the issue of most importance in this study remains faithful
interpretation of 154 complex individual experiences accord-
ing to survey data. In the absence of face-to-face interviews,
how does a survey designed by the researchers allow those
researchers to see beyond what is already known? Are
reported outcomes characteristic of the integrity and honesty
that comes from a research practice of listening for what is
not known (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002)?
Kumar and colleagues (2006) reported statistical data
from interviews with 493 participants. Their analysis proved
useful in making correlations between CAM use and objec-
tive determinants such as educational level, socioeconomic
status, or age. However, their quantification and statistical
analysis of more subjective areas, including knowledge of
CAM and reasons for CAM usage, risked misrepresentation
and may have oversimplified the data (Chacko, 2003;
Krageloh, 2008). In contrast, Chacko (2003) used ethno-
graphic methods to determine usage of complementary strat-
egies in diabetes treatment. Her research also took place in
India and found participants relied primarily on biomedical
treatment for their condition, but often used Ayurvedic and
folk remedies as supplements. In addition to employment of
markedly different research methodology, her conclusions
provided substantially different reasons for CAM usage. As
opposed to finding correlations with age, education, and
socioeconomic factors, Chacko's observations and use of
open-ended questions during in-depth interviews revealed
health management decisions were linked to cultural back-
ground and environmental resources. Where Kumar et al.'s
(2006) research recommended biomedically based education
in treatment options, including CAM, Chacko's (2003)
research found evidence of locally based healing knowledge
as a source of cultural capital.
Validity of the Data
Consideration of divergent methodology, diverse methods,
and contradictory results brings one to question validity of the
data. Where internal validity is the reliability of an interven-
tion to produce an outcome in a controlled environment,
external validity considers applicability of research outside of
the testing conditions. The need for rigorous internal validity
must also be balanced with external validity for real-life
applicability (Krageloh, 2008). For researchers Ritenbaugh
and colleagues (2008), the tension between internal validity
Massey and Kirk 9
and external validity was evident in their application of a
randomized controlled clinical trial protocol for assessment
of a whole systems approach to treatment of temporoman-
dibular disorders. One hundred sixty participants were ran-
domized to three treatment arms to receive individually
tailored care according to naturopathic, TCM, or speciality
care. Efficacy was assessed according to four measures of
pain, using a conditional change model to assess change.
Protocols were applied to increase similarities among differ-
ent practitioners administering care. Although variation in
timing of endpoint data collection, involvement of multiple
practitioners, and variability of individualized whole sys-
tems methodology may not satisfy calls for rigorous experi-
mental controls, the research does sufficiently reflect the
way in which these modalities are actually implemented in
real-world practice (Tilburt & Kaptchuk, 2008).
Findings substantiating low reliability, questionable or
subjective validity, and a lack of inter-rater reliability in stud-
ies involving multiple practitioners give rise to discussions
pertaining to diagnostic uncertainty and variability.
Diagnostics are an important feature in all health systems for
two reasons: In the clinic, they are fundamental for their
impact in treatment planning, efficacy, and outcomes (Joshi,
2004; Mist, Ritenbaugh, & Aickin, 2009), and in research,
they are demonstrative of sound empirical basis and funda-
mental for their representation of theoretical underpinnings
of the whole system being investigated (Mist et al., 2009).
Mist et al. (2009) and Joshi (2004) quantifiably evaluated
typical diagnostics used in TCM (tongue, pulse, and observa-
tion) and Ayurveda (evaluating prakriti based on observation
and interaction), respectively. Mist and colleagues (2009)
assessed inter-rater reliability and reproducibility of diagnos-
tics between practitioners using Fleiss kappa statistical anal-
ysis to consider the reliability and validity of diagnostic
judgments between practitioners. Joshi (2004) took a differ-
ent approach, attempting to quantify what are traditionally
subjective, observation-based diagnostic methods to evalu-
ate accuracy of prakriti classification. Both studies found a
sound empirical basis and consistency in diagnostics, indi-
cating transferability of research and potential applicability
of quantified measures in future studies (Joshi, 2004; Mist
et al., 2009).
The importance of clinical validity for the production of
"valid" knowledge reflects biomedicine's prevailing attitude
of superiority, stemming from empirical establishment. The
profession holds that it has the scientific basis, university
education, professionalization, and laboratory validation to
prove efficacy, which alternatives do not. Yet, although that
may be the dominant ideology, reviews of the evidence sug-
gest a relatively small proportion of clinical procedures are
in fact scientifically established with the gold standard dou-
ble-blind randomized clinical trial (Winkelman, 2009). As
identified by Kligler et al.'s (2011) and Ritenbaugh et al.'s
(2008) research teams, for the obvious reasons of ethical
dilemma and practicality, ideal investigation standards are
not always possible. Consequently, allopathic medicine is
also guided by clinical observation, the same system of veri-
fication used for centuries in Indigenous and alternative heal-
ing traditions (Winkelman, 2009).
Convergence of the Data
Diametrically opposing conceptual approaches and diagnos-
tic criteria can make comparison between research in bio-
medicine and alternative medicine systems problematic,
though not irresolvable (Saini, 2012; Winkelman, 2009).
Finding a degree of parity with allopathic standards, accord-
ing to Eurocentric research standards, appears to be a wide-
spread goal among the research synthesized (Joshi, 2004;
Kumar et al., 2006; Mist et al., 2009; Ritenbaugh et al.,
2008).
In investigating the possibility of quantifying Ayurvedic
diagnostics, Joshi (2004) provided a foundation for clinical
comparison between Ayurvedic diagnostics and allopathic
clinical standards of measurement. Based on pioneering psy-
chology research analysis of personality types (Eysenck &
Martine, 1987, as cited in Joshi, 2004), Joshi suggested his
method for translation of typically subjective data to quanti-
tative estimates may help with the scientific establishment of
Ayurveda. Making recommendations for further application
of the methodology, such as computation of nadi patterns for
diagnostic assessments, Joshi (2004) stated quantitative esti-
mates are a necessary basis for biostatistical analysis of
Ayurvedic diagnostics that may prove advantageous in the
convergence of Ayurvedic research data with Western
approaches for integrative health approaches.
In addition to being a useful tool for increasing validity,
triangulation is one method of cross-validation for assessing
congruency across methods and practices (Saini, 2012).
Multiple applications of triangulation were central to the
research process undertaken by Jones et al. (2013) whose
research provided a sound example of strategies to ensure
data reliability and validity. For data triangulation, inter-
views sought to elicit further perspective from other whanau
(family) members. Method triangulation was achieved using
photovoice, drawings, and observational field notes to enrich
interview content. Investigator triangulation was achieved
by consultation with members of the research team, seeking
collective agreement regarding themes. Theoretical validity
was achieved with peer review by outside research experts,
and extended fieldwork engaging community members in
consultation.
Research Measures
In addition to the matter of how to measure health and heal-
ing, it is worth considering what to measure. Measures of
health care efficacy and effectiveness are variable. They are
also changing. The dominant research interest of science is
shifting from the absence of symptoms to the distinct goal of
10 SAGE Open
wellness. This shift in focus has been a catalyst in the devel-
opment of new research measures (Durie, 2004) more
aligned with native science's prioritization of gathering
understanding and meaning from data rather than seeking to
control or predict research outcomes (Cajete, 2004).
Increasingly, mixed methods of research are adding meaning
to quantitative data (Slocum-Gori et al., 2013), as the value
of subjective experiences of health as a source of both mean-
ing and knowledge is more widely recognized (Cajete, 2004).
Outcome Measures
The measure of outcomes, as opposed to outputs, is also
being recognized as a more appropriate and meaningful way
of assessing effectiveness in health care. Outcome measures
are not comparable with clinical rating scales or patient sat-
isfaction surveys because they are not confined to particular
health measures. Outcome measures allow for a more global
perspective and may incorporate individual, whanau, and
clinical views of physical, emotional, social, environmental,
and spiritual domains (Durie, 2004). Valid outcome mea-
sures for TCAM research must be consistent with terminol-
ogy and concepts unique to each healing system. To measure
effects of therapies on QoL, researchers such as Joshi (2004)
are working to create analogous measures appropriate to
healing traditions. As new outcome measures overlap with
existing measures, increasing contribution can be made to
existing knowledge bodies (Tilburt & Kaptchuk, 2008).
Wellness Measures
The premise of Indigenous health research measures is that
wellness should be a key objective for the intervention. With
a shift in measurement, from outputs to wellness, comes an
increasing need to understand the way in which health is
conceptualized. If the measures are to be both accurate and
useful, they must be constructed according to Indigenous
concepts of health (Durie, 2004). Thus, fundamental to
research in Indigenous health are Indigenous understandings
of health itself (Durie, 2004).
Understandings of wellness differ between and within
worldviews. Connor (2012) explores two definitions of well-
being: extrinsic and intrinsic. He explains extrinsic well-being
as a deriving of wellness from material means represented as
standard of living and QoL. Government reporting of eco-
nomic growth or poverty alleviation as a determining factor
for health is an example of Western-centric aspiration of well-
being as earning potential. Kumar and colleagues (2006)
research aligns with extrinsic well-being values, looking for
correlations between CAM utilization and variables including
socioeconomic and education status as health indicators. In
contrast, research by Shukla and Gardner (2006), Jones (2013),
and Chacko (2003) investigated intrinsic well-being. Intrinsic
well-being comes from feelings of fulfillment and enhanced
relationships that promote well-being of places, sustaining the
community and environment. Indigenous-inspired wellness
frameworks are centered on aspects of intrinsic well-being
including identity, autonomy, control, community inclusion,
and family kinship. Well-being is therefore a direct result of
relationships with people and care for ecology in the places we
share everyday (Connor, 2012).
If comparisons are to be made between health systems
grounded in divergent worldviews, with contrasting defini-
tions of well-being, researchers must possess expertise in the
system being studied as well as the research methodology
applied to be informed in their exploration during the
research process and in creative application of the research
data. The innovation must not risk diminishing innovations
of the past. Rather it must uphold the wisdom of the past to
inspire new responses to wellness challenges, in a world that
has vastly changed over the centuries (Royal, 2005). Both
Joshi (2004) and Mist et al. (2009) identified the importance
of researcher background expertise in the system being stud-
ied. Understanding theoretical underpinnings of the whole
system that is being evaluated allows for recognition of sub-
tleties that may otherwise be overlooked or misinterpreted.
Thus, it is evident that the focus is shifting from analysis of
small components of healing practices to the wider context
of parent knowledge systems, upholding diverse values and
more fully recognizing interacting components of the heal-
ing process (Winkelman, 2009).
Transfer of Knowledge
Contrary to those critics who suggest rejuvenation of ancient
knowledge would be "going backwards," in this time of
increasing globalization and increasing prevalence of chronic
lifestyle health conditions (Chacko, 2003; Durie, 2004;
Kumar et al., 2006; Murthy, 2010), there may be much
understanding to be gained from traditions that have observed
the health impacts of urbanization over thousands of years
(Murthy, 2010; Royal, 2005).
Knowledge of ancient health traditions is often transmitted
orally through generations, emphasizing practice-based teach-
ing and practical learning. Information may be codified within
scriptures or undocumented (Shukla & Gardner, 2006). Shukla
and Gardner (2006) made a useful distinction between local
medicine traditions, describing traditional systems of medi-
cine (TSM) as those based on systematic codified knowledge
from pharmacopedias or ancient scriptures in comparison with
traditional medical knowledge (TMK) or folk medicine, which
is orally transmitted with skills acquired by "doing." Even in
the absence of formalized texts and distinct lack of legal or
political support, these systems have endured over time.
Community Knowledge
CBPR approaches are revealing the immense potential of
local knowledge in growing and legitimizing TCAM knowl-
edge, applicability to wider audiences, and recognition by
Massey and Kirk 11
governments and nongovernment organizations (Shukla &
Gardner, 2006). Research of Shukla and Gardner (2006) has
provided a platform for which formally trained scientists and
botanists can interact with holders of traditional knowledge.
In addition to their achievements implementing community-
based conservation, outcomes of their work demonstrate the
huge potential for legitimization of knowledge, community
education models for knowledge transmission, collaborative
funding and research opportunities, and mobilization of
communities. Their effective implementation of a grassroots
research approach is also informing government agendas for
ecological sustainability and health. The challenge is one of
durability, requiring supportive legislative and policy mea-
sures beyond the community, at national and international
levels (Shukla & Gardner, 2006).
Systematic Reviews
The systematic review is a research approach to knowledge
transfer that aims to bring primary research evidence closer
to decision making. Regarded as the most reliable method of
summarizing data and evaluating evidence, systematic
reviews of CAM can affect considerably health care decision
making, media portrayal, public opinion, and attitudes
among the scientific community (Linde, 2009).
In a systematic review of mixed method studies consider-
ing the credibility of aboriginal research designs, Saini
(2012) found none of the 68 reviewed studies conducted a
cross-validation analysis between aboriginal and Western
research methodologies. In this absence of evidence, Saini
(2012) found grounds neither for the dismissal of Indigenous
research designs nor for necessitating use of Western mea-
sures of validity and reliability. Rather, Saini (2012) found
justification to move away from conformity to Western sci-
entific processes toward culturally relevant standards of par-
ticipation, authenticity, and tradition in research processes.
Without examining feasibility and limitations of applying
Western notions of validation to assess credibility of
Indigenous knowledge, scientific "rules" of research can be
used as a control mechanism rather than a method of knowl-
edge expansion. Such ethnocentric epistemology can lead to
the assimilation of traditional knowledge into Western
frameworks, under the guise of facilitating "legitimate" dis-
course (Saini, 2012).
The highly subjective and interpretive nature of method-
ologies currently being explored for the investigation of
whole systems of Indigenous healing has some bearing on
the reliability and validity of systematic reviews in CAM,
including Indigenous healing systems. Insufficient reporting,
publication or funding bias, and errors in quality assessment
are issues creating controversy and debate in both CAM and
biomedicine. Systematic review methods are well developed
for RCTs; however, methods for the systematic review of
qualitative data are still developing (Linde, 2009; Ring,
Ritchie, Mandava, & Jepson, 2010; Tong, Palmer, Craig, &
Strippoli, 2014). Thomas and Harden (2008) described "the-
matic synthesis" as one approach to analyzing and synthesiz-
ing qualitative research in systematic reviews addressing
questions about the lived experiences and perspectives of
people. Using health promotion and public health as the con-
text for their methodological development, their work is
moving beyond the assessment of "what works?" to answer
policy makers' questions about intervention need, accept-
ability, appropriateness, and intervention implementation.
Despite these limitations, in a comprehensive analysis of
more than 8,000 Ayurvedic research articles, sourced from
approximately 700 research journals, Manohar, Eranezhath,
Mahapatra, and Manohar (2012) found close to half of the
published research literature on Ayurveda is in the form of a
review paper. What is more, their findings suggest a majority
of original research is specific to subjects of drug standard-
ization and preclinical studies. Although clinical trials, case
studies, and case reports were sourced and included in the
review, a scarcity of research assessing Ayurveda as a whole
system (Manohar et al., 2012) indicates the substantial
research gap and the need for development of methodolo-
gies. Once a body of literature is established utilizing new
methodologies appropriate for whole systems research, sys-
tematic reviews may yield more accurate results.
Applicability of TCAM Knowledge
Perspectives holding TCAM as subsidiary to biomedicine are
reiterated and reinforced with research funding allocation.
Those few studies funded by biomedical organizations inves-
tigating TCAM as an alternative to biomedicine are unlikely
to offer true assessment of their potential (Winkelman, 2009).
In a randomized controlled clinical trial of acupuncture treat-
ment for hypertension published by the American Heart
Association, Macklin et al. (2006) found "active acupuncture
provided no greater benefit than invasive sham acupuncture
in reducing systolic or diastolic blood pressure" (p. 838). Yet,
despite the rigorous methodology cited in the article, physio-
logical changes and reported outcomes are curiously contrast-
ing. For example, decreases in diastolic blood pressure are
consistently greater among those receiving individualized
acupuncture than those receiving sham acupuncture through-
out treatment duration and for more than 35 weeks following
treatment commencement. It is beyond the scope of this arti-
cle to investigate or presume motivation of any author, publi-
cation, or funder. However, reporting limitations of some
papers prompts questions surrounding potential bias.
Repositioning of Indigenous and traditional healing sys-
tems as complementary rather than alternative systems of
medicine may reduce polarity with biomedical systems and,
in turn, allow traditional medicines a greater role in main-
stream health systems as a tool for healing and health promo-
tion (Murthy, 2010). Integrative medicine takes this a step
further. Investigating the feasibility of yoga therapy integra-
tion, Slocum-Gori and colleagues (2013) based their research
12 SAGE Open
at an urban cancer center. Using a mixed methods approach
including focus groups with health care providers and breast
cancer survivors as well as self-reported surveys, the research
aimed to understand factors that might impede or promote
integration of yoga therapy. Data gathered from breast can-
cer survivors indicating previous use of CAM and yoga prac-
tice suggested acceptability and sustainability of a yoga
therapy program. Corroboration obtained from health care
providers regarding feasibility and existing literature docu-
menting outcomes of yoga therapy provided evidence of
practicability and potential effectiveness of an integrative
treatment program. The oncology setting was a significant
choice of site in that it was later to become the site of integra-
tive cancer treatment services, beginning with yoga therapy.
Slocum-Gori et al.'s (2013) research team also addressed
social factors with provision of group yoga therapy. TCAM,
especially Indigenous traditions, consider social environ-
ment and health of the collective peoples central to care,
whereas biomedicine's primary concern with biological
well-being means a biomedical physician may focus treat-
ment purely on the individual. Slocum-Gori and colleagues'
(2013) study is significant for their examination of compati-
bility of biomedical care with yogic healing practices affect-
ing the subtler energetic body, breath, and mind. Such
concepts expand biomedical preconceptions of the body. In
TCAM healing traditions, the physical body is just one of
multiple levels of the body upon which healing can operate.
Vitalism underlies the basic principle of self-healing that
is central to many TCAM therapies and Indigenous realities.
Vitalism emphasizes the body's innate ability to restore natu-
ral balance, allowing linking between the sacred and secular,
spiritual and scientific. Indigenous beliefs remind us that
such aspects are not distinct. On the contrary, they are con-
stantly interacting within and without the client to produce
health (Winkelman, 2009). Quantum science may be bring-
ing Indigenous understanding of nature closer to Western
scientific thought, with chaos theory explaining the process
of movement and evolution of energy for creation of new
forms (Cajete, 2004). Such theories are relevant to growing
research knowledge too, as inherent to Indigenous knowl-
edge is the notion that the world is an embodiment of knowl-
edge. Thus knowledge is energy, intrinsic to the world,
inseparable from lived experience and more than merely a
finite product of research (Royal, 2005).
Receptivity to the Learnings
There has been a struggle for the space for Indigenous initia-
tives, in health and education alike, raising the issue of
receptivity to Indigenous ways within mainstream institu-
tions established according to Eurocentric values and hierar-
chy (Pihama et al., 2002). For Kaupapa Mori researchers
and writers, including Tuhiwai-Smith (1999) and Bishop and
Glynn (1999, as cited in Pihama et al., 2002), Indigenous
research methodologies are a counterhegemonic movement
indicative of a proactive political discourse. Research vali-
dating Indigenous reality challenges unequal distribution of
power and structural barriers. Indigenous people are no lon-
ger positioned as "other," but become the norm in their own
cultural construction.
Historically, contests between peoples were territorial.
Increasingly today, contests are cultural and intellectual,
seeking to determine areas in which Indigenous knowledge
can prevail or coexist for the benefit of Indigenous people
and, indeed, all people (Durie, 2004). Political and social
dominance of biomedicine can lead to technical, organiza-
tional, and administrative absorption of TCAM systems of
medicine, with the adoption of techniques, control of prac-
tices, and assimilation of knowledge. As traditional remedies
are recognized as effective, pharmaceutical firms and multi-
national corporations have made attempts to seize rights and
patent active plant compounds for commercial use. Although
internationallawprotectscustomaryknowledgeofIndigenous
communities, cultural mediators are required to define who
constitutes the Indigenous community, acquire informed con-
sent, establish cooperative agreements, and broker the gap
between local and global systems (Winkelman, 2009).
Contributions to the translation of health knowledge from
diverse worldviews are accruing across disciplines (Chacko,
2003) free from constraints of biomedical partiality
(Winkelman, 2009). This narrative synthesis finds health
geography is identifying relationships between health and
place (Gesler & Kearns, 2002), anthropology and sociology
are lending research methodologies and providing insights
linking health and culture (Winkelman, 2009), and education
is identifying differences in wellness aspirations and meth-
ods for empowerment in the research process (Clough &
Nutbrown, 2002; Connor, 2012). The weaving of knowl-
edge, experience, and expertise across typical discipline and
sector boundaries is not to undermine the positioning of
boundaries encompassing areas of expertise. Rather, to posi-
tion knowledge within a broader multidimensional whole
and maximize potential for unexpected, innovative discover-

Conclusion
The expansive nature of TCAM and Indigenous knowledge
derived from intellectual and spiritual praxis is challenging
researchers to develop methodologies capable of examining
spirituality, belief, and experience while maintaining objec-
tivity (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014). At a time when the value of
such knowledge is being increasingly recognized for its
potential to contribute to well-being of not only populations
but also the earth on which we live, the need for such meth-
odologies is urgent (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014; Murthy, 2010).
Currently, researchers are balancing representation of
Indigenous worldviews, TCAM participants' realities, and
the need to conform to conventional research protocols
(Ahuriri-Driscoll,2014;Ritenbaughetal.,2008).Maintaining
Massey and Kirk 13
research credibility is not just about integrity in research pro-
cesses and proper selection of methodology. It is also about
the taonga, the gift, of participants' stories (Jones et al.,
2013).
Clough and Nutbrown (2002) suggested the rationale for
methodology selection may be as much an act of faith and
feeling as a cognitive process. Whole systems research
(Langevin et al., 2011; Ritenbaugh et al., 2008) allows con-
sideration of context in which the healing system originates,
the place in which research is being conducted, and the soci-
ological dynamics, including structural factors, that are
reproducing or redefining health outcomes (Abraido-Lanza,
Armbrister, Florez, & Aguire, 2002). Kaupapa Mori
research included in this synthesis also demonstrates meth-
ods are becoming intrinsic to the issue for investigation,
rather than extrinsic and separate from it (Jones et al., 2013;
Te Karu et al., 2013). In this sense, the methods researchers
choose can be tested as much as their hypotheses or objec-
tives (Clough & Nutbrown, 2002). Although not made
explicit, in some studies (e.g; Macklin et al., 2006) the
assumption is that effective measures of efficacy will bring
healing practices in line with a set of values and measures,
standardized according to biomedicine. Rather, such research
risks limiting understanding of complex healing responses
and outcomes.
Tierney (1998, as cited in Clough & Nutbrown, 2002)
concluded that new methodological and epistemological
avenues demand the charting of new paths, not the repeated
return to well-worn paths. Yet, in the literature reviewed, many
researchers are walking well-worn research paths with investi-
gations conforming to methodologies based on scientific phi-
losophy. The methodological gap in truly innovative research
methodologies is now fusing with the potential of Indigenous
science­based research approaches. Even in light of distinct
identities, these methodologies have common philosophical
foundations reflective of cultural and community epistemology
(beliefs and knowing), ontology (nature of being), and axiol-
ogy (values and behaviors). This reconciliation of academic
research priorities with TCAM knowledge and Indigenous
realities (Royal, 2005) is expanding research methodologies,
growing a body of literature, and supporting TCAM incorpora-
tion in community and hospital health for innovative practice
and health care provision (Coulter et al., 2014).
