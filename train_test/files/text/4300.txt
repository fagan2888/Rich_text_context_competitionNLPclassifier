Introduction
This article focuses on the meanings of a creative arts lei-
sure programme designed for caregivers of people with
dementia. Outreach tutors from a South London art gallery
conducted four 90-minute art- and craft-making sessions
within a Healthy Ageing Café in an inner London borough.
The programme was designed in conjunction with carers
who attended the café with their loved ones affected by
dementia. During the carers' arts programme, the people
with dementia were cared for elsewhere, within the familiar
environment of the café. The four sessions were followed
by a joint art gallery visit for caregivers and their loved
ones with dementia, where they saw the group's creative
products on public display alongside other artwork from
the gallery's collection.
While informal caregivers are recognised as a crucial
resource for people with dementia, many experience consid-
erable stress and health problems. They report more depres-
sion and anxiety than demographically matched people
without caring responsibilities (Lavela and Ather, 2010),
and are at greater risk of depression than those who care for
older people with other chronic conditions (Schoenmakers
et al., 2010). Some spouse caregivers describe struggling to
preserve a sense of connectedness within their marital
relationship, a loss of identity and inability to meet their
own needs (Gahagan et al., 2007; O'Shaughnessy et al.,
2010). These losses may be compounded by reductions in
leisure, social activities and other meaningful occupations
(Clark and Bond, 2000; Hwang et al., 2009). Female car-
egivers, in particular, may feel unable to accept day-time
respite services from feeling that, as women, they are
obliged to care and unentitled to leisure (Strang, 2001). In
addition to experiencing stress and loss, caregivers of peo-
ple with dementia are also more vulnerable to declining
physical health (Pinquart and Sörensen, 2007), particularly
in contexts of socioeconomic hardship and inadequate sup-
port. Nonetheless, positive aspects of dementia caregiving
also need acknowledgments such as personal growth, resil-
ience and spirituality (Netto et al., 2009).
`A respite thing': A qualitative study of a
creative arts leisure programme for family
caregivers of people with dementia
Lorinda Pienaar1 and Frances Reynolds2
Abstract
This study explored the meanings of participating in a 5-week creative arts leisure programme designed for family
caregivers of people with dementia, using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Eight carers attended and four who
met the eligibility criteria agreed to be interviewed. Participants experienced the arts group as providing a sense of
freedom and respite, strengthening identity through promoting achievement, offering social support through a collective
focus on art- and craft-making and increasing resilience for coping with caring. Some found the 5-week programme too
short. Benefits were linked to the security of knowing that loved ones with dementia were close by, being well cared for.
Further research is needed into the long-term benefits of creative arts groups for promoting carer well-being.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
There is some recognition that leisure activities offer a
buffer against stress, and have health-protective effects,
especially among less socially advantaged people (Iwasaki,
2006). Leisure activities potentially reduce caregiver bur-
den (Losada et al., 2010). Some caregivers view leisure as
a temporary escape from caring, which helps to preserve
health and emotional functioning, thereby enhancing cop-
ing (Gahagan et al., 2007). However, some describe feeling
too overwhelmed by obligations and guilt in relation to car-
ing to take any leisure breaks (Gahagan et al., 2007;
Schumacher et al., 2012). For some whose lives are domi-
nated by caregiving and exhaustion, making time for lei-
sure can be seen as an additional burden ­ `one more thing
they "had to do"' rather than presenting opportunities for
choice or relaxation (Gahagan et al., 2007: 59). Taking time
for self away from the cared-for person also entails access
to alternative care arrangements. Shanley (2006) suggested
that brief experiences of leisure could provide a creative
form of respite for carers enjoyed while their loved ones
with dementia were being well cared for by others.
However, the forms of leisure that were envisaged con-
sisted of `pampering' and passive entertainment, rather
than activities that invited active engagement, challenge or
development of new skills.
There is increasing recognition that engagement in crea-
tive art-making may offer a source of health and subjective
well-being, with suggestions that this is a topic that requires
more research (Camic, 2008; Clift et al., 2009; Mowlah
et al., 2014; Murray and Gray, 2008). Furthermore, muse-
ums, art galleries and other cultural resources are now
being regarded as promoting public health (Camic and
Chatterjee, 2013).
A number of literature reviews have summarised evi-
dence about the benefits of visual art-making for health and
well-being, in medical contexts (Staricoff, 2004; Stuckey
and Nobel, 2010), for people with mental health problems
(Hacking et al., 2006; Heenan, 2006; Leckey, 2011;
Spandler et al., 2007) and older people (Castora-Binkley
et al., 2010). Recurring themes are that engagement in art-
making reduces stress, facilitates contact with more posi-
tive emotions, increases self-worth and promotes feelings
of social connectedness. The review by Perruzza and
Kinsella (2010) adds that creative arts interventions com-
monly enhance perceived control and sense of purpose, and
may transform the illness experience. Such reviews com-
monly observe that evidence about outcomes is weak with
very few studies including control groups or random sam-
pling. Yet as Castora-Binkley et al. (2010) point out, people
tend by virtue of their own interests to opt in or out of crea-
tive leisure interventions and retain a high level of personal
influence over their activities within such interventions. So,
for ethical and practical reasons, randomised controlled
designs, regarded as preferable in many fields, are rarely
selected for research into the effectiveness of creative art-
making programmes.
Few studies have explored the benefits of creative art-
making programmes for carers. Camic et al. (2014) offered
carers and people with dementia eight 2-hour joint sessions
based in two art galleries, involving viewing and discussion
of selected items of art displayed in the gallery, as well as
personal art-making. The reported findings focused primar-
ily on benefits for participants with dementia (described by
themselves or their caregivers), such as increased cognitive
engagement, reminiscence, new learning and social inclu-
sion. There was less detailed analysis of caregivers' experi-
ences of this creative intervention. The intervention
achieved no change in the quantitative measure of caregiver
burden although qualitative accounts suggested that car-
egivers enjoyed the social aspects of the intervention.
Although evidence is limited, it suggests that a creative arts
intervention may offer caregivers multi-faceted experi-
ences that promote subjective well-being, such as hope,
affirmation and mutual support.
Purpose of this study
The research objective was to explore the meanings of a
creative arts leisure intervention for caregivers of family
members with dementia.
Method
A qualitative research approach was appropriate to gain a
rich `insider' perspective. Interpretative phenomenological
analysis (IPA) has underpinned previous research into the
creative process (e.g. Lawson et al., 2014; Van Lith et al.,
2011) and provided insight into the challenges of caregiv-
ing (O'Shaughnessy et al., 2010). This is an approach that
values detailed idiographic analysis of small numbers of
participants to obtain rich understandings of their shared
anddistinctiveexperiences(Smithetal.,2009).Researchers'
own contribution to interpreting and bringing theoretical
understanding to participants' accounts is acknowledged.
In this study, it was considered helpful for each author to
bring different professional backgrounds (occupational
therapy and health psychology) to the analysis process.
Ethics
The project was approved by the University Ethics
Committee. People attending a Healthy Ageing Café in an
inner London borough were made aware of the creative arts
intervention through posters displayed within the café.
Anyone interested in attending was then provided with
detailed written information. For ethical reasons, caregiv-
ers were informed that they could choose to participate in
the creative programme without taking part in the research
interviews. Carers were also reassured that their attendance
at the Healthy Ageing Café was not in any way affected by
their decision to take part or not in the creative arts project.
Pienaar and Reynolds 3
They had to attend at least three of the four art-making ses-
sions to be eligible to be interviewed. Those agreeing to be
interviewed gave written consent. All stated names (of par-
ticipants, and any other person referred to in interviews) are
pseudonyms.
The intervention
The creative arts intervention comprised four sessions of
art-making in the carers'group, and one free-of-charge visit
to a prestigious local art gallery accompanied by the loved
one with dementia. In the preliminary stages of designing
the programme, both carers attending the café and outreach
tutors from the local art gallery were consulted. The practi-
cal sessions were 1.5
hours weekly, facilitated by an arts
tutor from the local art gallery (with an arts, not therapy,
background), and a trained staff member from the
Alzheimer's Society. Both were familiar with managing
group dynamics in a sensitive way. There were no fees for
attending and no particular requirements concerning the
caregiver's status or severity of the loved one's illness. The
practical creative art-making sessions followed a person-
centred philosophy, with participants able to choose from
among a range of arts and crafts each week. There were no
ground rules about what could/could not be expressed.
Caregivers were free to communicate their caregiving
experiences in words or nonverbally through their art if
they wished, or to focus on other topics during the art-
making sessions.
Participants
Four of the eight participants who attended the creative arts
programme gave written consent to join the research. This
sample comprised two female spouse caregivers (Maggie
and Doreen), one male spouse caregiver (Bob) and one
daughter caregiver (Lydia), with ages ranging from 50­
79
years approximately. All were Caucasian, spoke fluent
English and lived in inner London, and appeared to be of
lower socioeconomic status. Small samples allow in-depth
analysis, and are valued in IPA studies (Smith et al., 2009).
Regarding the four who were not interviewed, two male
participants opted out of the programme after the initial
session to continue to participate with their loved ones in
the Café's regular activities. One male carer's spouse
became unwell towards the latter end of the programme
which prevented him from participating in the carers' art
programme, although he was still attending the café. One
male with an ethnic minority background did not attend the
carers' art intervention sufficiently to meet the inclusion
criterion.
Data collection
Semi-structured interviews were carried out in privacy, in a
room within the café by the first author (L.P.) within a week
following the conclusion of the creative art intervention, so
that the memory of their experience was still fresh.Although
involved in the initial design of the programme and liaison
with the art gallery, the interviewer had played no part in
the intervention, and had not observed participants during
their creative activities. This was thought to reduce any
pressure on participants to `reward' the facilitators who
provided the creative arts experience by inflating positive
feedback. A topic guide (Table 1) offered some structure,
but the intention was to follow the participants' own
accounts of their lived experiences in a flexible, sensitive
way. Interviews were about 50minutes long.
Fairly straightforward questions were asked at the begin-
ning to ease potentially burdened caregivers into talking
about their experiences. More exploratory and sensitive
questions were sequenced in the middle of interview, and
the final two questions helped to lighten the emotional tone.
The guide was nonetheless used flexibly, respecting the
participants' own priorities.
Data analysis
Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verba-
tim. As part of the immersion process, L.P. also listened a
few times to the audio-recordings before transcribing and
analysing. It became apparent from the interview data that
to understand the meanings of the creative art group, there
also needed to be analysis of the caregiving experience that
participants also described at some length in the interviews.
Their accounts of caregiving revealed psychological needs

that the art-making group may have helped to address.
Following the guidelines of Smith et al. (2009), the initial
stage of data analysis was idiographic, starting with identi-
fication of specific meanings through marginal comments,
and then moving to inferring broader themes. Both authors
conducted this process independently in the initial stages,
charting themes and subthemes. Through cross-case analy-
sis, the authors then looked for convergent themes, and
followed usual IPA practice (e.g. Van Dijkhuizen et al.,
2006) in seeking to resolve differences by discussion and
going back to the data, rather than seeking any form of
quantitative agreement. The authors sought to maintain a
`phenomenological attitude', `reflexively restraining pre-
understandings' (Finlay, 2008: 1), albeit within limita-
tions, as IPA methodology regards researchers as bringing
their own interpretative lenses to the task of understand-
ing participants' accounts. Reflexivity, sensitivity to con-
text and attention to divergent as well as convergent
themes were all strategies that helped to increase credibil-
ity. To help maintain a sense of the first-person accounts,
all themes and subthemes are tagged with a relevant quota-
tion. Transferability of findings cannot be assumed. Rather,
readers need to assess the similarity between the context of
this study and others (Smith et al., 2009).
Findings
The four caregivers all described experiencing various
challenges in their caring role. These are presented in
Table 2.
In brief, participants described their everyday life as a
`compromised experience', requiring considerable toler-
ance, ongoing concessions and modified expectations and
loss of self.All described experiencing loneliness and some-
times feeling overwhelmed by their obligations and the con-
stant need to `think for two'(e.g. in anticipating and avoiding
risks to the cared-for person). Caregiving depleted their
resources, and two of the caregivers feared negative conse-
quences for their own health.
Five convergent themes (some with further subthemes)
encompassed the meanings of the creative art-making
group, and will be explored below (Table 3).
`It felt good doing art work' ­ an accumulation
of positive influences of art-making on mood
and identity
All four participants were enthusiastic about the creative
art-making group, expressing not only pleasure in engaging
the creative process but a deep sense of self-affirmation.
They took pride in various aspects of their artwork and
were sometimes surprised by its quality and, by inference,
their own creative abilities:
I had done something I have never done before and I was
pleased with it. So I suppose that made me feel good ... I'm so
proud of that bag. (Doreen)
A number of experiences contributed to participants
taking pride in their work, including their own aesthetic
judgements, and the feedback of tutors and group mem-
bers. Some took pride in accomplishing more than the
tutor had expected in the sessions, and in making items of
sufficient quality to be shared as gifts (which in turn com-
municated their creative abilities to others, and led to posi-
tive feedback):
The bags came out really lovely. I was so proud of them. I
didn't think I could do anything like that. And I made two
bags, so my two daughters can have one each. (Maggie)
The experience of achievement was further enhanced by
participants' experiences of the art gallery visit, where they
saw their art products on public display. For example, Lydia
said, `I was shining', to describe her excitement at seeing
her work displayed alongside acclaimed art from the gal-
lery collection. Lydia expressed a desire to reconnect with
her creative self, and was hoping to use the intervention as
a springboard to future art-making opportunities:
I feel I could go back and do something else now. (Lydia)
While two felt able to re-contact previous creative inter-
ests through the intervention, two participants (Maggie and
Doreen) had never before engaged in art-making as adults.
They commented on how the art group had enriched them
as persons, exposing them to novel experiences and the
opportunity to learn:
I was never taught nothing, none of them [artistic] things at
school. So it's very interesting knowing all these different
things. (Maggie)
Given their everyday experience of giving constant
attention to their loved one and `thinking for two', they had
found the new opportunity to learn to be a refreshing and
distinctive experience. Like Lydia, both Maggie and Doreen
expressed a desire to follow-up the intervention by engag-
ing in further creative occupations, although they recog-
nised substantial barriers to doing so (associated with their
caregiving commitments).
Bob had described himself as having `always been'
interested in art, but like Lydia had not participated for
some time, due to his caregiving and other responsibilities.
Through the art group, he felt he had re-contacted his crea-
tive side:
For me it got me drawing again ... I probably wouldn't have
got interested in art again had we not come here. (Bob)
Pienaar and Reynolds 5
All participants described valuing the expressive ele-
ment within the creative process.
Even if you don't feel that you are very creative ... some sort
of expression comes out. (Lydia)
The self-expressive nature of art-making offered a
source of excitement contrasting with their more mundane
`everyday' obligations:
I have knitted [before], but that is something completely
different, you know, it's art. (Doreen)
Lydia expressed excitement about the incidental or sur-
prise element inherent to art-making:
You can't see what it's gonna come out like ... It is hard to
imagine ... until you peel back the lino and the prints come
out.(Lydia)
Lydia's account was distinctive in that she initially felt
obliged to participate by her friends in the café, rather
than having an intrinsic interest. Yet she went on to expe-
rience the self-expressive process within this group as
stress-relieving:
First I didn't wanna go into the room even though I'd agreed to
it ... but when I came into the room and started to do it ... it
seemed to lift my mood. (Lydia)
Although Lydia described the art-making mostly as
improving her mood, at times she understood her imagery
to express sadness and grief:
I got a bit emotional for doing the flower for my mum, `cause
you know, obviously I miss her. (Lydia)
The support of the group in such circumstances was highly
valued, and will be explored further in the next theme.
`Enjoying being together' ­ group participation
motivates participation
All participants highlighted the social benefits of participa-
tion in the programme, as well as enjoying the inner experi-
ence of creativity. They valued the camaraderie of the
group, mutual encouragement and the respectful input and
careful planning of the arts tutor. The group offered a shared
and mutually affirmative experience:
Because we were looking at what each other were doing,
giving each other praise. (Bob)
These shared positive interactions among peers not only
built companionship, but also confidence:
It build my confidence up a bit, because ... we were all
commenting on each other's work ... Nice to see what other
people can do as well. (Lydia)
All participants commented on the pre-existing bond
between them from their previous meetings in the café, a
dynamic that may have strengthened the intimacy and
openness between them:
I think because we knew each other before, you know, it
helped. (Doreen)

6 Health Psychology Open 
Participants highlighted certain similarities between the
caregivers' art group and a discussion-based caregiver sup-
port group. Both offered opportunities to share problems,
but they valued the art group for having a more enjoyable
focus, and relieving the necessity to talk about caregiving:
Like the normal carer forums we have, we just sit and listen to
each other's solutions to problems, you know what problems
they having ... helpful ... but sometimes depressing, whereas
this was enjoying being together. (Bob)
The group was regarded as encouraging and supportive,
motivating attendance:
Working in a group gives you encouragement, you know, to do
it, whilst if you were on your own, you would probably not
have bothered. (Bob)
Maggie and Doreen thought that the non-judgemental
attitude of the group aided trust and self-expression:
We could sort look at each other's work and say, oh yeah, oh
God, what the hell! ...We could talk while we were doing it ...
and it was good. (Doreen)
No negative dynamics were described. All participants
recognised the central role of the facilitators not only in
teaching skills for making arts and crafts, but in orchestrat-
ing such a supportive environment:
They just made us feel welcome, made us feel at ease,
encouraged. (Lydia)
Doreen, in particular, highlighted how the facilitators
had instilled confidence in their new art-making skills:
They told us we did wonderful things even though we looked
at it and thought they were rubbish, but they boosted your
confidence. (Doreen)
Participants also valued the way the facilitators had
organised the programme which allowed them to attend
without any need to set aside time for preparation:
Just came to do what was put before me. (Bob)
This preparation enabled participants to take part in the
programme without compromising their caring responsi-
bilities. This links with the next theme, experiencing the
leisure group as a form of respite.
`It was a sort of like a respite thing' ­ the
caregivers' art group as a space of freedom to
allow caregivers to do their `own things'
`Respite' refers to a temporary period of rest or relief from
something difficult or distressing. Participants regarded the
facilitated creative art group as offering respite, as a space
of freedom away from caring, and a symbolic space to
allow them to do `their own things':
It gave me a couple of hours away from Harry, you know, sort
of like respite really, which I know, I won't normally get ... it
was sort of like a respite thing. (Doreen)
While only one participant (Doreen) explicitly used the
term `respite', all participants'accounts reflected aspects of
this concept. A key to the success of the programme as a
form of respite or space for stress relief for the caregivers
was the security of knowing that their loved ones with

dementia were being cared for appropriately in close prox-
imity within the café environment. This security enabled
them to forget the worries of caregiving, to focus more
deeply on their creative occupations and interact more fully
with other group members and the facilitator. Participants
thought that both they and their loved ones experienced a
temporary freedom from the intensity of the caregiving and
carereceiving relationship. Even so, two described check-
ing on the well-being of their loved ones during the art ses-
sions. This illustrates the interdependence of the couples
and perhaps the caregiver's need to cope with guilt when
engaged in a separate activity:
I would not have participated in it, if I hadn't been here [at the
café] with my wife ... I would pop out and then come back
again ... I just go to see if she was, you know, alright with that.
(Bob)
Maggie also found freedom in the art room, feeling it
was near enough to her husband and yet separate:
I don't know what he was doing out there. So it was quite nice,
to just be on our own. (Maggie)
Maggie expressed a desire to continue her creative art-
work, but thought that this was unlikely, without the provi-
sion of satisfactory alternative care for her husband.
Participants enjoyed respite from caregiving both
through spending time immersed in the art-making process
as well as participating in the social exchanges surrounding
this. This helped them to forget about the outside world
temporarily, including their caring responsibilities:
It did seemed to you know, help me to relax and forget about
things. (Lydia)
`Easier to care' ­ influence of the creative arts
groups on caregiving
The creative process and the accepting social environment
of the art group were thought to promote relaxation. Three
participants experienced this as having long-term benefits,
enhancing their sense of control and providing a resource
for caregiving for some time after the end of the sessions:
It was easier to care, I don't feel so stressed and under pressure
... when I come away from here. (Lydia)
Maybe I can reflect back on how I felt when I was doing the
sessions and try to ... calm down that way. (Lydia)
You are going to be relaxed when you go outside to your
husband. (Maggie)
It is recognised that as the interviews were conducted
within a week after the end of the programme no long-
term benefits could be explored. But in the short-term, the
respite experience of the creative arts programme had
beneficial `ripple out' effects into the caregivers' manage-
ment of the stress of caring, according to their accounts.
However, not all the experiences of the creative pro-
gramme were positive, as shown by the final theme below.
`Wasn't long enough' ­ limitations of the
programme
Despite clear information about the structure of the pro-
gramme at the start, three of the participants expressed
some dissatisfaction with the number of sessions, their
duration each week, and the rather cramped physical space
available for the art group:
Without being rude ... it wasn't sort of a lot of time. (Lydia)
At one point in the interview, Lydia also elaborated on
her personal limitation, being `quite slow working', which
may have exacerbated the problem for her.
Doreen took a more pragmatic approach to the pro-
gramme's time limitations, appreciating that their loved ones
with dementia might be stressed by their caregivers'absence:
I know we had limited time here ... They're limited on the
time because you are with your partner and, you know
sometimes ah, I don't know if you [have] noticed, sometimes
some of the partners get a bit aerated and ah, [ask] `where are
they'? (Doreen)
The ending of the programme evoked a mixture of feel-
ings. Maggie and Doreen expressed some sadness at the
ending:
It's sad, very sad ... When I went to ... the art gallery, I
thought, ah, this is the last time. (Doreen)
Lydia expressed even stronger feelings about the ending
of the programme, and seemed to feel cheated out of a pre-
cious opportunity:
It's a bit upsetting, really ... `cause you get to do something
and you enjoy it, and then it sort of stops. (Lydia)
Although Bob wanted the programme to be longer, he
did not dwell on any negative aspects of the ending. Instead
he focused on the reconnection with his creative self as a
positive gain from participating in the programme, and
expressed his hope to continue:
It got me drawing again. (Bob)
Discussion
Although the analyses of the participants' caregiving
experiences were conducted separately from the analyses
of the meanings of the art-making group, it is clear from
8 Health Psychology Open 
comparing Tables 2 and 3 that the creative art programme
met certain deep-seated needs arising from giving day-to-
day care to a person with dementia. This group, with its
variety of affirmative experiences, addressed (albeit in an
inevitably limited way) the compromised experience of
caring, which required continuous watchfulness (e.g. to
manage risk, or de-escalate tension), careful negotiation
of joint activities and loss of self. The social processes
within the group supplemented, in a particularly pleasur-
able way, the support already gained from the carers'
group at the Healthy Ageing Café. In focusing upon pro-
cesses and products of art-making, these social interac-
tions helped to strengthen a sense of self that was not,
within that art-making space, solely defined by caregiv-
ing, or burdened by everyday problems. Guilt, associated
with leaving loved ones with dementia to alternative care,
was minimised by having them close by, in a familiar sup-
portive environment. Caring was very much experienced
as depleting coping reserves, and the art-making group
offered a temporary respite. Participants felt that the expe-
rience of focusing deeply on creative expression enabled
them to return to their caregiving role in a better state of
emotional control and relaxation.
The findings suggest that the creative art-making group
affirmed a positive identity outside of caring, albeit for a
brief period. Furthermore, the caregiver identity was also
maintained by having relatives nearby, in close enough
proximity to contact if necessary. Tangible artistic products
(appraised personally as well as shown to others within the
group, displayed more formally in the art gallery or given
as gifts) helped demonstrate participants' capability to self
and others. This resonates with evidence that creative occu-
pations strengthen a person's sense of identity beyond the
labels imposed by long-term mental and physical illness
(Lawson et al., 2014; Stickley and Eades, 2013).
Participants thought they only rarely expressed feelings
about caregiving through their artwork, a finding that con-
trasts with that of Roberts et al. (2011), whose participants
were caring for family members with mental health prob-
lems. Roberts et al. found that carers of people with mental
health problems tended to interpret the artwork on display
in an art gallery through the lens of their caregiving experi-
ences (e.g. viewing the art as metaphorically expressing
loss and grief). There was no evidence, from participants'
accounts, that facilitators had dissuaded them from such
cathartic self-expression. Instead, it appears that the partici-
pants created their artwork primarily for pleasure rather
than as a form of therapy.
Roberts et al. (2011) also described the gallery experi-
ence as offering carers a bridge into new occupations unre-
lated to mental health settings, and the caregiving role.
Some of the caregivers in this study also expressed a desire
to continue with their newfound creative leisure occupation
but acknowledged substantial barriers unless suitable alter-
native care for their loved ones was provided.
The creative arts group offered camaraderie and partici-
pants highlighted that making art together was more pleas-
urable than problem-focused carer support groups. There
was no evidence that facilitators set any ground rules pre-
venting the airing of problems. Similar feedback was elic-
ited by Roberts et al. (2011) in their art gallery intervention
for carers of people with mental health problems. The moti-
vating and supportive functions of the group and the tutors
(or group facilitators) in community art interventions have
been noted in other studies (e.g. Camic et al., 2014; Lawson
et al., 2014), and clearly rely on the facilitators' skills not
only in presenting interesting art projects but managing
group dynamics to enhance the experience of mutual sup-
port, respect and sharing.
This study has been relatively unusual in discovering
that a creative arts leisure intervention may offer a mean-
ingful form of brief respite to caregivers of people with
dementia. Gahagan et al. (2007) also described leisure as
having a respite function, although the meanings of specific
leisure occupations for caregivers were not explored.
Shanley (2006) suggested that brief episodes of pleasurable
leisure could be regarded as a form of respite for carers
although rather passive occupations were described such as
manicures or massage. The creative art-making group in
this study offered opportunities for active learning and self-
direction, perhaps strengthening a sense of agency more
effectively than passive leisure occupations. It provided
caregivers with a symbolic space of freedom, akin to the
`haven away from the rest of life' described by Collie et al.
(2006: 765), and the `safe harbor' described by Predeger
(1996: 56). Creative arts interventions have been portrayed
as offering temporary respite also by La Cour et al. (2005)
and Garrett (2014).
Participants in this study linked the respite experience
to having their loved ones nearby. For many caregivers,
feelings of guilt and moral obligation act as barriers to tak-
ing up leisure opportunities (Argüelles and Von Simson,
2001; Gahagan et al., 2007). The presence of dependency
behaviour or insecure attachment in the person with
dementia may also limit caregivers from taking time for
leisure (Nelis et al., 2013). The close physical proximity of
caregivers to their loved ones may have helped maintain
attachment security between the caring dyads, and reduced
caregiver worries. By reducing these various barriers, car-
egivers may have enjoyed more complete immersion in the
creative occupation, setting aside their caring concerns
temporarily and achieving flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 2002).
Resonating with the flow concept, they also described
experiences of optimal challenge during art-making,
orchestrated by the tutor, promoting confidence and
achievement. Csikszentmihalyi (2002) posits that aware-
ness of self is much reduced during flow experiences but
emerges more strongly afterwards, enhancing the person's
subsequent ability to pursue valued goals, cope with adver-
sity and take pleasure in everyday events. This theory
Pienaar and Reynolds 9
resonates with the caregivers' descriptions of deriving
feelings of calmness from participating in the group which
they could then apply in their caregiving roles.
Critical evaluation
Programmes for caregivers need to be designed flexibly
around their needs and goals (Zarit and Femia, 2008), and
carers were involved early on in the design of this inter-
vention. Despite this, most participants found the interven-
tion too short. The problems of managing endings have
been noted in previous studies of art-making groups
(Lawson et al., 2014; Stacey and Stickley, 2010). Careful
attention is needed when designing community art projects
to planning suitable follow-up events and opportunities for
participants who wish to take their new interests forwards.
Previous studies have noted that some participants use arts
interventions as `stepping stones' to new roles and occupa-
tions (Heenan, 2006). It could be considered unethical to
offer participants a highly meaningful, stress-relieving
experience without any real opportunity to take it further.
The IPA method was appropriate for exploring caregiv-
ers' intertwined experiences of creativity and well-being,
an under-researched topic, although this methodology does
not enable isolation of effective `variables' within an inter-
vention. The researchers worked together to verify and
challenge emergent themes, starting with an idiographic
analysis and using reflexivity to increase awareness of their
respective roles within the research process. For example,
L.P.'s background as an occupational therapist would likely
encourage appreciation of the psychological importance of
active (rather than passive) leisure participation, while the
second author's (F.R.) background as a health psychologist
was likely to attune her to caregivers' identity issues.
The study sample was small but in line with IPA guide-
lines (Smith et al., 2009), and contained a balance of people
with and without previous art-making experience. However,
the research lacks the stories of the four caregivers who
attended part of the programme but who did not wish (or
were not eligible) to be interviewed. For ethical reasons, no
further enquiry was made of their experience of the inter-
vention, and it is therefore not known if they were less sat-
isfied with it, or not. It is interesting, however, to note that
three of the four who were not interviewed returned to tak-
ing part in café activities with their loved ones, in prefer-
ence to being separated.
L.P. established trust and rapport when initially planning
the intervention with the caregivers at the café. F.R. was an
`outsider' to the data collection process, and helped analyse
the interview data with a fresh perspective. The context is a
clear limitation, with the intervention situated in an inner
London borough. Carers from more advantaged back-
grounds and with lengthier experience of art-making might
have offered richer accounts of the meanings of this creative
activity. The findings may not readily transfer to caregivers
from more affluent areas who may have more options for
maintaining leisure occupations, for paying adult education
course fees to enable further arts participation, and/or pur-
chasing professional respite care.
Further research
Additional studies are clearly needed to explore the short-
term and long-term benefits of creative arts interventions
for caregivers of people with dementia. Indeed, the value
of visual art-making over and above any other form of
leisure group for carers needs to be established. This study
focused on a group of participants who were already well
known to each other, and the merits and difficulties inher-
ent in joining an unfamiliar creative leisure group could
be explored. In particular, participants linked their ability
to enjoy relaxation and flow during art-making to the
security of having their loved ones nearby. Close physical
proximity appeared to help participants manage feelings
of guilt and moral obligation that act as barriers to leisure
participation and its health-promoting properties, as
well as maintaining their identities as committed carers.
Interviewees offered little comment about any guilt and
anxiety associated with being separated from their loved
one during the creative intervention. But we note that a
further three carers who enrolled in the programme pre-
ferred to discontinue and return to participating in café
activities with their loved ones. Carers' experiences of
managing guilt when pursuing independent interests is an
issue worthy of further research.
Conclusion
This qualitative study found that a short-term creative arts
leisure intervention for carers of people with dementia
facilitated self-expression and positive identity, addressing
the undermining effects of chronic caregiving on self. The
arts group also provided a deep sense of camaraderie and
mutual encouragement. Because interaction focused on
artistic processes and products, it was regarded as more
pleasurable and relaxing than a problem-oriented carers'
group. The creative art-making within a supportive social
environment helped to alleviate the sense of depletion that
carers associated with caregiving and offered a brief expe-
rience of respite that they felt enhanced their resilience and
coping resources.
Caregivers'needs for psychologically restorative leisure
activities are largely overlooked. Museums and art galleries
are being increasingly recognised as having a role to play in
promoting well-being, being rich in cultural heritage, offer-
ing a `sanctuary' from everyday stress and promoting cog-
nitive and emotional exploration in a non-stigmatising
setting (Camic and Chatterjee, 2013). Further research into
the benefits of creative arts interventions for caregivers is
recommended.
