Background. Previous studies have linked higher religious attendance and longer survival. In this study, we examine
the relationship between survival and private religious activity.
Methods. A probability sample of elderly community-dwelling adults in North Carolina was assembled in 1986 and
followed for 6 years. Level of participation in private religious activities such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study was
assessed by self-report at baseline, along with a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables. The main out-
come was time (days) to death or censoring.
Results. During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,137 subjects (29.5%) died. Those reporting rarely to never
participating in private religious activity had an increased relative hazard of dying over more frequent participants, but
this hazard did not remain significant for the sample as a whole after adjustment for demographic and health variables.
When the sample was divided into activity of daily living (ADL) impaired and unimpaired, the effect did not remain sig-
nificant for the ADL impaired group after controlling for demographic variables (hazard ratio [RH] 1.11, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 0.91­1.35). However, the increased hazard remained significant for the ADL unimpaired group even
after controlling for demographic and health variables (RH 1.63, 95% CI 1.20­2.21), and this effect persisted despite
controlling for numerous explanatory variables including health practices, social support, and other religious practices
(RH 1.47, 95% CI 1.07­2.03).
Conclusions. Older adults who participate in private religious activity before the onset of ADL impairment appear to
have a survival advantage over those who do not.
HE impact of religion on health is a topic of increasing
interest to epidemiologists, sociologists, and clinicians.
Many recent studies have found health differences between
religious and nonreligious groups, yet many questions re-
main unanswered. New studies are needed to illuminate
which specific areas of religious participation are beneficial
to which health outcomes (1).
Investigations to date have predominantly explored the
effect of organizational religious behaviors, such as church
attendance, on health. Although some research has been
criticized for poor design, a growing body of soundly con-
ducted investigation is showing a positive health effect for
religious participants (2,3). Six recent studies have demon-
strated a reduction in mortality for frequent church attenders,
even after controlling for demographic, health, social, and
psychological factors known to impact mortality (4­9).
Studies of private religious activities have shown a psy-
chological benefit for participants. In a randomized, con-
trolled, double-blind study, O'Laiore found persons who
pray to have improvement over nonpraying counterparts in
10 of 11 measures of self-esteem, anxiety, and depression
(10). Other studies have shown a correlation between sense
of well-being and private religiousness (11­13).
Few prospective studies have been published to date that
analyze the relationship between physical health and private
religiousness. Various cross-sectional studies have shown
that those who are sicker or more disabled pray more
(14,15). This finding agrees with Krause and Van Tran's
suppressor model of religiousness, which theorizes that religion
is used as a coping device in times of crisis (16), but it fails
to demonstrate possible health benefits. Gupta identified
prayer as protective against coronary heart disease in a rural
population in Rajasthan, India (17), but did not find prayer to
be significantly protective in an urban population (18). Do
private religious activities such as prayer or study of scrip-
ture have a beneficial health effect in a Western population?
We hypothesized that elderly persons who participated in
private religious activity would survive longer than those
who did not and that this benefit would be stronger in those
who reported private religious activity in the absence of any
impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs). Impairment
in ADLs has been shown to correlate with both increased
private religious activity and increased mortality (15,19).
Analysis of the ADL impaired and the ADL unimpaired
separately may show greater benefit for the ADL unim-
paired, because their religious activity may reflect habit and
not simply prayer under duress.
METHODS
Design and Sample
This study used a prospective cohort design. Data came
from the Duke University Established Populations for Epi-
demiologic Studies of the Elderly (Duke/EPESE), a popula-
tion survey that was part of a multicenter, collaborative in-
vestigation of persons aged 65 and older. The North
Carolina sample was enrolled in 1986­1987 and is a popu-

lation-based, stratified random sample, with African Ameri-
can and rural older adult subjects oversampled. At baseline,
5,223 residents of five contiguous counties (Durham, Gran-
ville, Vance, Warren, and Franklin) in the Piedmont area of
North Carolina were selected. Details of the sampling
method are presented elsewhere (20). Of those initially se-
lected, 4,162 completed the baseline survey, yielding an
80% response rate. Of these, 26 were neither Caucasian nor
African American and were deleted from the analysis. An
additional 160 proxy interviews were deleted, because no
self-reported data were available for these interviews. Of
the remaining 3,976, data on private religious activities
were available for 3,851 sample members.
Analysis of the 125 nonresponders to the private religious
activity question versus the 3,851 responders revealed no
significant differences in age, gender, rural or urban loca-
tion, or years of school between the groups. However, a
higher percentage of African Americans than white sample
members answered the religion items.
The religious composition of the sample is overwhelm-
ingly Protestant (97.3%, with 59.3% Baptist). Only 1.0%
identified themselves as Catholic, Jewish, or Eastern Ortho-
dox; 1.4% reported that they were either atheist or had no
religious association; 0.2% of sample members had missing
data for this question.
Assessment
Private religious activities were assessed by the question
"How often do you spend time in private religious activities,
such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study?" Responses
available were (1) rarely or never, (2) a few times a month,
(3) once a week, (4) two or more times a week, or (5) daily
(or more often). Responses were dichotomized into rarely or
never (1) versus all other groups (2­5). There were 678 sample
members (17.6%) in the rarely to never group and 3,173
sample members (82.4%) in the other groups combined.
Vital status was assessed through annual follow-up inter-
views either by telephone or in person, with dates of death
confirmed by abstracting death certificates (n  1,137).
Surveillance continued until 1992, with length of time in
days from the initial interview until death recorded as the
time until death. Those alive at the final interview in 1992
were censored at 183 days (6 months) beyond the last inter-
view date. Those lost to follow-up, 7.3%, were censored at
183 days beyond the last contact.
Covariates were chosen because of demonstrated associa-
tions with mortality (4,20­28). All were measured at base-
line (1986­1987) and comprised five categories: religion,
demographics, physical and mental health, social connec-
tions, and health practices (see Table 1).
In addition to private religious activity, both church atten-
dance and religious media use were analyzed. Church atten-
dance and religious media use were divided into once a
week or more versus less than once a week.
Demographic variables included age, defined as 65­74
versus 75 or older, gender, ethnicity, and education. Educa-
tion was divided between 0 to 10 years of school and 11 or
more years of school, because high school in North Carolina
formerly ended after the eleventh grade.
Physical health variables included chronic conditions and
impaired daily activities (inability to perform one or more
ADLs [29] vs no inability in ADLs) as well as self-rated
health. Lifetime history of chronic conditions were dichoto-
mized as none versus one or more of the following (by self-
report): cancer, stroke, heart attack, diabetes, hip fractures,
fracture of other bones; or current angina pectoris, bronchi-
tis, cardiac glycoside use, antihypertensive use, or cognitive
impairment on the Short Portable Mental Status Question-
naire (30). Additionally, two blood pressure (BP) measure-
ments were taken; if systolic BP averaged 140 mm Hg or
diastolic BP averaged 90 mm Hg, a diagnosis of hyperten-
sion was included in the chronic diseases variable. Self-
rated health was measured as the answer to the question
"Overall, how would you rate your health--as excellent,
good, fair, or poor?" with responses dichotomized between
good or excellent versus fair or poor. Mental health mea-
sures included depression, as measured by a CES-D depres-
sion score of 9 or more (31), and self-reported negative life
events in the year prior to baseline. Negative life events in-
cluded illnesses or deaths of family or friends, divorce, resi-
dential moves, legal or financial problems, and retirement.
Social connections variables included marital status and
six measures of social support: immediate social network,
personal contacts in the last month, satisfaction with a sup-
portive confidant, satisfaction with social interaction, and
support given and received from family and friends.
Health practices included smoking, defined as yes or no
as a current smoker at the baseline interview; drinking alco-
hol, dichotomized into 20 or more drinks in the previous
month versus less than 20; and body mass index. Body mass

index was divided into bottom quintile, middle three quin-
tiles, and top quintile, with the middle group used as the ref-
erence group.
Covariates with missing data at baseline were imputed to
their mean if fewer than 2% were missing. If between 2%
and 5% were missing, stochastic regression imputation tech-
niques were used. No variable was missing more than 5%.
Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS (32) or SUDAAN
(33) statistical analysis software. Baseline associations be-
tween private religious activity and all covariates were ana-
lyzed using the chi-square statistic. The relationship between
private religious activity and each of the covariates was as-
sessed. The unadjusted association between higher levels of
private religious activity and survival was examined first,
followed by the sequential addition of five groups of covari-
ates, using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with
95% confidence intervals (34). First demographic variables
were added, followed by the addition of physical and mental
health variables. Social connections were added third, fol-
lowed by health practices, and fifth and finally by the addi-
tion of the two religion variables. This model was first ap-
plied to the group as a whole and then to the ADL impaired
and ADL unimpaired groups separately.
We tested for both a dose­response and a threshold effect
for devotional activity as follows. Four dummy variables
were constructed to represent increasingly frequent devo-
tional activity. Two Cox proportional hazard models were
analyzed, the first including the full complement of control
variables but without the four dummy variables, and the
second also fully adjusted but with the addition of the four
dummy variables. The difference between the omnibus
(Satterthwaite adjusted) chi-square statistics was 4.04 (4 df)
(cut-off for .05
2  9.48), which indicates no evidence of a
significant trend across increasing levels of devotional activity.
Subsequently, a third Cox proportional hazard model was
analyzed, including all control variables in addition to the
dichotomized variable for rarely/never versus any devo-
tional activity. The difference between the omnibus chi-
square statistic for the model with the single dichotomous
variable and the same statistic for the model with four
dummy variables was 0.18 (3 df) (cut-off for .05
2  2.35).
This indicates no evidence of significant additional effect
above the threshold level of several times a month. Finally,
the increase of 3.86 (4.04­0.18) in the chi-square statistic
created by adding the single dichotomous variable to the
model that included only control variables provides evi-
dence of a significant effect for any devotional activity (cut-
off for .05
2 [1 df]  3.84). Therefore, we present in Table 1
the hazard ratios for the independent variable, dichotomized
as any versus no devotional activity.
RESULTS
First, the relationship between private religious activity
and covariates at baseline was analyzed. Odds of low pri-
vate religiousness were associated with a likelihood of both
low church attendance and low religious media use. There
was also a strong association between gender and private re-
ligious activity, with males nearly three times more likely
than females to be low private religious participants. Addi-
tional demographic features of those likely to be infrequent
participants were younger age, urban location, and white
race; education level was not significantly different between
the two groups. In physical and mental health measures,
only those reporting negative life events occurring in the
year prior to survey were less likely to be rare to never par-
ticipants in prayer, meditation, or Bible studies. Odds of im-
paired function, history of chronic health conditions, and
depression were not significantly different between higher
and lower frequency participants. Interestingly, those who
were married were much more likely to be in the rarely to
never category. Other than marital status, those with a
higher score on social contact measures were more often in
the higher frequency category. As expected, alcohol and
smoking were much higher in the rarely to never group. Al-
though no significant correlation was found with the lowest
quintile in body mass index, the highest quintile showed a
higher frequency of participation. Overall, correlations were in
the expected direction and consistent with previous research.
Those who reported rare participation in private religious
activities were more likely to die during the follow-up pe-
riod than those who did not, but this association disappeared
for the group as a whole once known risks for mortality
were included (RH 1.08, 95% CI 0.90­1.30). In the strati-
fied models, similar results were obtained for the ADL im-
paired group (n  2,058; Table 1). However, a significant
survival advantage was seen for those reporting private reli-
gious activity among the ADL unimpaired group (n 
1,793; Table 1). The increased hazard remained statistically
significant for this group after controlling for demographic
and health variables (RH 1.63, 95% CI 1.20­2.21), and this
effect persisted after further controlling for explanatory
variables, including health practices, social support, and
other religious practices (RH 1.47, 95% CI 1.07­2.03).
DISCUSSION
In this study we found that private religious activities
provided a protective effect against mortality for an elderly
population free of functional impairment, even after con-
trolling for numerous covariates; no such effect persisted in
the ADL impaired group. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to document a possible protective effect for private re-
ligious activity on mortality in a large community-dwelling
population. Whereas studies of organizational religious ac-
tivity (ORA) and mortality have shown a positive correla-
tion (4­9), this study demonstrates protection via nonorga-
nizational religious activity (NORA), at least for those who
practice NORA before the onset of impairment in ADLs.
Impairment in ADLs has long been recognized as a
strong predictor of mortality in elderly adults (19,35­41).
Functional health status, as measured by ADL impairment,
is often viewed as a "method of conceptualizing [overall]
health status" (19). Because declining health has been asso-
ciated with increased private religiousness (14,15), our
analysis was stratified by ADL impairment. The purpose
was to distinguish between those praying in a foxhole (i.e.,
offering prayer in times of need at the end of life) and those
who may have had a long-term habit of private devotionals
more likely to positively affect physical health.
PRIVATE RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY AND SURVIVAL M403
A study by Koenig and coworkers demonstrated that an
ill, elderly population may not be able to overcome the force
of impending mortality even when employing various be-
haviors that have been shown in healthy populations to cor-
relate with extended survival (42). It is possible that the rel-
atively subtle effects of private religious activity are not
sufficient to overcome the overwhelming force exerted on
mortality by health decline to the point of ADL impairment.
Thus, the milder effects of private religious activities on
mortality are more detectable among those persons who are
relatively healthy. Future studies may want to ask how long
a person has been engaged in private religious activity, to
determine if habits begun after the onset of ADL impair-
ment are begun too late to show a survival benefit.
A number of hypotheses have been offered to explain the
physical health benefit from religious activity. Social sup-
port and health behavior differences have often been sug-
gested as the primary mechanisms of health benefit, but this
study found, as did other recent religion and mortality stud-
ies (4­9), that adjustments for differences in these areas did
not fully account for the survival benefit religious partici-
pants received.
Another prominent theory suggests that the repetitive rit-
ual of prayer or meditation provides health benefits through
mechanisms such as blood pressure reduction and improved
psychoneuroendocrine function. This model asserts that
physiologic benefits occur as a response to positive emo-
tions experienced during prayer or meditation (43). Al-
though a growing body of literature supports these asser-
tions, particularly in those who practice meditation techniques
frequently (44­46), the repetitive ritual model does not seem
adequate to explain the results found in this investigation.
First, frequent meditation is not a part of typical Protestant
religious practice. Second, this study found that the protec-
tive benefits extended nearly equally from those that partic-
ipated daily or more all the way down to those that reported
only participating in private religious activity a few times a
month. In other words, the risk appears only in the lowest
frequency group, and the benefit extends to all other groups,
regardless of frequency.
Although the repetitive ritual model does not seem to
provide a useful model to explain the findings here, other
prominent hypotheses do. Many of these, such as improved
psychological state (43), enhanced immunity (47), better
coping methods (48), and stress reduction (49), do not re-
quire daily participation to provide physical benefit. Those
who pray or meditate even occasionally may have an im-
proved psychological state or better coping skills, and thus
reduced stress and/or enhanced immunity, because of the
comforting knowledge of having a higher being to turn to in
time of need. Levin has proposed that simply having reli-
gious faith may cause "the fostering of learned optimism"
(43). Participating in prayer or Bible study even occasion-
ally may be an identifying feature of those who benefit from
this learned optimism engendered by faith. Having a sense
of the availability of a Higher Power may reduce stress and
thus provide the various psychological and physical benefits
described.
Data from this study indicate that the absence of private
religious activity and the subsequent lack of psychological
benefit may manifest at a level below clinical depression
and still have a physical health impact, because depression
was one of the covariates for which these results were con-
trolled.
This study has a number of strengths. These include a
large sample size, longitudinal design, good response rate,
and adjustment for numerous confounders. The endpoint
chosen, all-cause mortality, is subject to minimal reporting
bias, and the elderly population surveyed had a mortality
rate high enough to provide more than adequate follow-up
events for hypothesis testing.
One significant limitation of this study was the lack of
specificity for the private religious activity variable, which
asks about "prayer, meditation, or Bible study." Although
meditation is not typical of Southern Protestant religious
observance, sample members were likely reporting both on
prayer and Bible study, and may have been including in the
category of prayer even brief ritualistic prayer before meals.
Future studies should both separate prayer from other types
of private devotionals and distinguish between different
types or dimensions of prayer. Other limitations included
the lack of data on both the nutrition and exercise levels of
sample members. Additionally, the predominantly Protes-
tant nature of this population precludes generalizability to
non-Protestant populations.
Future studies may want to determine what aspect of pri-
vate religiousness is most beneficial to health. In a compre-
hensive review of the benefit of social support on mental
health, George described the accumulating evidence that
specific dimensions of social support may be differentially
important in protecting against late-life depression. Specifi-
cally, perception of social support is more protective against
depression than objective measures such as social network
size or structure (50). In particular, the availability of a con-
fidant and the perceived adequacy of social interaction have
shown strong protective health effects in community and
clinical samples (51,52). In the case of devotional activity, it
may be that the perceived availability of a Higher Power or
the perceived adequacy of the responsiveness of that Higher
Power, rather than the actual number of times an elder
called upon that resource, represents the key benefit to sur-
vival. Future studies may want to estimate the differential
effect of frequency of devotional behaviors versus the sub-
jective sense of the availability of a higher being.
This study indicates that physicians' appropriate support
of the faith of their patients may have positive health effects.
The study also strengthens the assertion that private religion
users receive not only psychological but physical benefits.
In conclusion, this analysis demonstrated a significant
protective effect against mortality for private religious ac-
tivity in a relatively healthy elderly population. This protec-
tive effect remained significant even after controlling for
multiple confounding variables. Although no protective ef-
fect persisted in the ADL impaired portion of our popula-
tion, this finding is consistent with the suppressor model of
religious participation (16), which posits that increased
prayer occurs in response to stress. The ADL impaired
group may have begun private religious activity only in re-
sponse to declining health, too late to show a protective ef-
fect against mortality.
