Background: Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of cardiovas-
cular outcomes and type II diabetes. Most of the metabolic
abnormalities defining metabolic syndrome are observed in HIV.
Objective: To determine the incidence and risk factors for
metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected adults in the Nutrition for
Healthy Living (NFHL) study (2000­2003) and prevalence relative to
the findings of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) (1999­2002).
Methods: Metabolic syndrome is $3 of the following: hyper-
triglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
hypertension, abdominal obesity, and high serum glucose. The
baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the NFHL study (n =
477) was compared to that in the NHANES (n = 1876), adjusted for
age, race, gender, poverty, exercise, and diet.
Results: Almost one quarter of NFHL subjects had metabolic
syndrome. Most with metabolic syndrome (77%) had low HDL and
hypertriglyceridemia plus $1 additional abnormality. The prevalence
of metabolic syndrome was significantly lower in HAART and non-
HAART users compared with NHANES participants unadjusted for
body mass index (BMI). After adjustment for BMI, it was no longer
significant but the trend remained. The incidence of metabolic
syndrome in the NFHL study was higher with increasing viral load,
higher BMI, higher trunk-to-limb fat ratio, and Kaletra (lopinavir/
ritonavir) or didanosine (ddI) use and lower among college-educated
persons.
Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome is mostly diagnosed through
low HDL and high triglycerides in HIV. The risk of developing the
syndrome is related to HIV, specific medications, and body fat.
Key Words: HIV, metabolic syndrome, prevalence, incidence,
longitudinal study, risk factors, NHANES

Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of developing
cardiovascular outcomes and type II diabetes. It was
estimated to be present in 23.7%1 of adults in the United States
between 1988 and 1994, and the rate is increasing. The
syndrome is defined as the occurrence of 3 or more of the
following abnormalities: hypertriglyceridemia, low high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, hypertension, abdom-
inal obesity, and high serum glucose. Metabolic syndrome in
the United States is more prevalent with increasing age and is
highest among Mexican Americans. Furthermore, African-
American and Mexican-American women have higher rates
than men in each of these ethnic groups.1
The components of metabolic syndrome have been
recognized in patients infected with HIV. Low HDL and low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and elevations in
triglycerides were observed in untreated HIV-infected patients
early in the HIV epidemic, before the advent of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART).2­4 Although these abnormal-
ities were seen most often in those with more advanced
disease, they also occurred in patients with asymptomatic HIV
disease.4 Since the mid 1980s, several additional abnormalities
have been noted in HIV, including hypertension,5 visceral
adiposity6,7 and insulin resistance.8,9 Although the relative
frequency of these abnormalities compared with the general
population is debated,8 and the etiology is unclear, specific
antiretroviral treatments9 have been implicated as causative
agents in some studies. Jerico et al10 showed a positive

association between metabolic syndrome and stavudine (d4T)
and lopinavir/ritonavir in HIV-infected adults in Spain.
The cumulative effects of HIV may play a role in the
occurrence of metabolic abnormalities because HIV-infected
patients are living longer as a result of successful treatment,
and they are then also at risk for type II diabetes and
cardiovascular disease associated with aging in the general
population. Certainly, risk factors for cardiovascular disease
and diabetes, such as poor dietary habits,11 low level of
physical activity,8 and smoking,12 are common in HIV-infected
adults.
The prevalence and incidence of metabolic syndrome in
HIV-infected adults in the United States is unknown. Two
Italian studies found a higher prevalence of metabolic
syndrome among Italian HIV-infected patients treated with
HAART13,14 compared with HIV-negative blood donors14 and
the general United States population.13
The purpose of this analysis was (1) to compare the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome and each of its 5 com-
ponents in HIV-infected adults with that in the US population
(National Health and Nutrition Survey [NHANES] 1999­
2002)15 (2) to determine the incidence and predictors of newly
developing metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected adults.
METHODS
Nutrition for Healthy Living Study
Study Participants
The Nutrition for Healthy Living (NFHL) study is
a cohort of HIV-infected adult volunteers who were followed
semiannually to evaluate the relation between HIV infection
and nutrition. Eligible participants included HIV-positive
adults (aged 18 years or older) living in the greater Boston area
or Rhode Island. Participants were recruited through advertise-
ments on the radio as well as in local newspapers, health
clinics, and physician networks as described previously.16­18
Individuals were excluded if they had any of the following
conditions at enrollment: pregnancy, thyroid disease, or any
malignancies other than Kaposi sarcoma. Participants were
also excluded if they were not fluent in English. Further details
of this study have been reported elsewhere.19­21 Beginning in
July 2000, metabolic measurements were collected, including
fasting serum glucose and lipids, waist circumference, and
blood pressure. The Institutional Review Boards at Tufts
University School of Medicine and Miriam Hospital, Rhode
Island, approved this study, and written informed consent was
obtained from each participant. NFHL data for these analyses
began at the first visit for which participants had all the
parameters necessary to diagnose the metabolic syndrome (n =
477). In this study, we included participants who were between
25 and 65 years old (actual range: 25­63 years) and were seen
between September 2000 and November 2003. The cross-
sectional analysis was performed on the first visit in this data
set. The longitudinal analysis was performed on those without
metabolic syndrome at the first visit and included all
subsequent visits or until a participant met the definition of
metabolic syndrome or died.
Interview Data
Trained interviewers collected information from patients
on demographics, dietary intake by 3-day food records, HIV-
related clinical events, and therapy.7 HAART use was defined
as current use at the first study visit in this data set. From
reported household income, we determined which participants
were living below the US federal poverty level (yes/no).22
Daily caloric intake was determined from the 3-day food
records using the Minnesota Nutrition Data System version
4.06_34. Physical activity was assessed by the physical
activity recall instrument developed by Sallis et al,23 which
assesses usual activity over the past 7 days. We defined
``regular exercise'' as any moderate, hard, or very hard phy-
sical activity in the past week and ``strength training'' as any
strength training in the past week.
Laboratory Data
Plasma triglycerides, serum HDL, and plasma glucose
levels were obtained after a 5-hour fast.18,20,21,24 Using the
Beckman LX-20 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA), plasma
glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method, plasma
triglycerides by the 2-step enzymatic method, and HDL by an
enzymatic method (separated by dextran sulfate, 500,000
molecular weight). HIV RNA was measured by the Roche
Amplicor Monitor reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Somerville,
NJ), with a lower detection limit of 400 copies/mL.
Physical Examination
Blood pressure was measured with the Omron Auto-
matic Inflation Blood Pressure Monitor (HEM-722CR,
Omron Healthcare, Inc., Bannockburn, IL) after the partici-
pant had been seated for 5 minutes with his or her feet on the
floor and his or her arms supported at heart level. Subjects
were weighed (kilograms) on a digital scale fully dressed but
without shoes, heavy clothing, or objects before eating or
drinking (minimum 5-hour fast). Height (centimeters) was
measured without shoes by a stadiometer. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared
(kg/m2) and then categorized into ,25 (normal or less), 25 to
29.9 (overweight), or $30 (obese).
Waist circumference was taken without outer clothing,
using a tape measure in light contact with but not compressing,
the skin.25 It was measured at the natural waist indentation at
the end of a normal expiration while subjects were standing.
Research personnel were trained and recertified semiannually
in anthropometry. The reliability of these measures has been
shown to be high.7
Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry
Yearly dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans were
performed on the Hologic QDR-2000 machine (Hologic,
Waltham, MA). A series of cutoff lines positioned at
anatomic markers was used to define trunk fat and limb fat
(arms and legs). The ratio of trunk fat to limb fat was cal-
culated, and the distribution was then divided into quar-
tiles for analysis. The quartiles were determined separately
for men and women.

National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1999­2002)
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey Participants
The NHANES (1999­2002) is a representative sample
of nonincarcerated adults in the United States selected on the
basis of a complex multistage design so as to include an
adequate number of minorities.15 We included NHANES
(1999­2002) participants who were between 25 and 65 years
old, had an examination in the mobile van rather than at
home, and who had blood drawn after fasting for at least
8 hours (n = 1876). To be consistent with the NFHL study,
we included all Hispanic/Latinos except Mexican Americans,
because only (0%) of NFHL participants were Mexican. In
the study by Ford et al, 1 Mexican Americans had the highest
risk of metabolic syndrome, and therefore differ from other
Hispanics.
Interview
Data were collected by means of personal interviews.
Poverty (yes/no) was determined by US Census Bureau
calculations (available at: http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/
poverty/povdef.html). Participants were asked if they had
engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity and muscle-
strengthening activities over the past 30 days. We defined
regular exercise as any moderate or vigorous activity over the
past month and strength training as any strength training over
the past month. Average daily caloric intake was determined
from 24-hour dietary recall. Daily caloric intake per body
weight was calculated (kilocalories per kilogram per day) for
the NFHL study and NHANES.
Definition of Metabolic Syndrome
The definition of metabolic syndrome is based on the
``Report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/A-
merican Heart Association Conference on Scientific Issues
Related to Definition.''26 It is defined as the presence of 3 or
more of the following 5 abnormalities: (1) abdominal obesity
(waist circumference .102 cm for men and .88 cm for
women, (2) hypertriglyceridemia (.150 mg/dL), (3) low HDL
cholesterol (,40 mg/dL for men and ,50 mg/dL for women),
and (4) high BP (systolic .130 mm Hg and/or diastolic $85
mm Hg), (5) high fasting glucose ($100 mg/dL). In the NFHL
study and NHANES, persons with a diagnosis of diabetes or
being treated for diabetes were classified as having ``high
fasting glucose'' (n = 9 in the NFHL study, n = 108 in the
NHANES) and persons taking medication for high blood
pressure were defined as having high blood pressure (n = 27 in
the NFHL study, n = 412 in the NHANES).
Analytic Methods
Outcomes
We evaluated metabolic syndrome and each of its
5 components (metabolic abnormalities) as separate outcomes.
Thus, the outcomes include metabolic syndrome, low HDL,
hypertriglyceridemia, high blood pressure, abdominal obesity,
and high blood glucose.
Nutrition for Healthy Living Study: Prevalence
Unadjusted Prevalence of Each Outcome in
Nutrition for Healthy Living Study
The unadjusted prevalence of each outcome within the
NFHL cohort was the number of cases of the outcome divided
by the total number of participants in the NFHL study (n =
477). To obtain the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around
each estimate of prevalence, we used generalized estimating
equations (GEEs) for the binomial with the Poisson
distribution, and we used the log link to obtain the robust
variance in PROC GENMOD.27 All analyses were conducted
in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Nutrition for Healthy Living Study Versus
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey: Characteristics and Prevalence
Characteristics
To determine if there were significant differences in
characteristics of HAART users and non-HAART users in the
NFHL study relative to characteristics of NHANES partic-
ipants, we used PROC SURVEYREG for continuous variables
and PROC SURVEYFREQ for categoric variables. Because
participants in the NHANES are selected by a complex
multistage design, analytic models using NHANES data must
include sample weights to produce correct national estimates
for the NHANES and the corresponding variances. We
specified the strata, cluster, and weight of the sampling scheme
for the NHANES using the NHANES variables ``sdmvstra,''
``sdmvpsu,'' and ``wtmec4yr,'' respectively. For the NFHL
cohort, we set weight equal to 1 and ``sdmvpsu'' to the
participant's identification number.
Unadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios for Each
Outcome: Nutrition for Healthy Living Study Versus
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
For each outcome, we determined the odds ratio (OR)
comparing HAART users in the NHFL study with
participants in the NHANES and non-HAART users in
NFHL study with participants in the NHANES (PROC
SURVEYLOGISTIC, SAS 9.1; SAS Institute)28 using the
same weighting scheme as explained previously. We first
obtained an unadjusted OR and then an OR adjusted for age
in years, race, gender, poverty, regular exercise, strength
training, and caloric intake. These variables are associated
with metabolic syndrome, and most differ between the
NFHL study and NHANES. We performed separate models
adjusted for BMI in addition to the other variables
mentioned previously. When there was significant evidence
for nonlinearity between age in years and each outcome, we
included the significant restricted cubic spline terms in the
model29 in addition to age in years. When the prevalence of
a metabolic abnormality is common, the OR may over-
estimate the true prevalence ratio.30 In this study, all the
metabolic abnormalities are common, with the exception of
high glucose.

Combinations of Components of
Metabolic Syndrome
We determined the combination of metabolic abnor-
malities for each person with metabolic syndrome. The fre-
quency of each combination was determined separately in the
NFHL study and NHANES.
Nutrition for Healthy Living Study: Incidence
of Metabolic Syndrome
The incidence rate of metabolic syndrome was
determined among those without the syndrome at baseline
who were followed over time. The incidence rate was the
number of new cases over the total person-months of follow-
up. There were 7026 person-months of follow-up. The
median (25th and 75th percentiles) time of follow-up was 19
months (25th 12, 75th 31). Because the NHANES is a cross-
sectional study, there are no incidence data available for
comparison on HIV-negative individuals.
We evaluated the relative risk of developing metabolic
syndrome across levels of demographic, clinical, and
nutritional predictors using Cox proportional hazards re-
gression with time-varying covariates (PROC PHREG, SAS
9.1; SAS Institute). Clinical and nutritional predictors were
assessed at the beginning of the interval before an event (BMI
and trunk-to-limb fat ratio) or over the interval before an event
(change in viral load, weight, exercise, diet, or medication
use). We categorized a change in viral load .0.5 log10
copies/mL as reflecting clinical treatment failure. We also
tested for duration of continuous medication use up until the
end of the interval. We tested for types of HAART use (eg,
protease inhibitor [PI] based, nonnucleoside reverse transcrip-
tase inhibitor [NNRTI] based, mixed) and specific medica-
tions. Predictors that were associated with developing
metabolic syndrome at P , 0.2 on univariate analysis were
tested in the multivariate model. Gender, age, and race were
included in the final multivariate model even though they were
not significant independent predictors so as to adjust for
confounding.
RESULTS
The characteristics of NFHL study participants, by
HAART use, and those of NHANES participants are shown in
Table 1. Significant differences between the cohorts are
described in the footnote for Table 1.
Unadjusted Prevalence of Each Outcome in
Nutrition for Healthy Living Study
The unadjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the
NFHL study was 24% (95% CI: 21% to 28%). The most
common metabolic abnormalities in the NFHL study were low
HDL (prevalence = 54%, 95% CI: 49% to 58%) and high
triglycerides (prevalence = 47%, 95% CI: 42% to 51%), and
the least common was high blood glucose (prevalence = 4%,
95% CI: 3% to 7%). The prevalence of high blood pressure
and abdominal obesity were 33% (95% CI: 29% to 37%) and
25% (95% CI: 22% to 30%), respectively.
Number and Frequency of Different
Combinations of Abnormalities: Nutrition for
Healthy Living Study Versus National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
The percentages of participants in each cohort (NFHL
study vs. NHANES) with the following number of abnormal-
ities were as follows: $1 abnormality (81.6% vs. 81.3%);
$2 abnormalities (51.8% vs. 56.7%); $3 abnormalities
(24.3% vs. 34.1%); $4 abnormalities (5.2% vs. 15.8%), and
all 5 abnormalities (0% and 4.5%). Among those with meta-
bolic syndrome in each cohort, 76.7% of NFHL participants
and 47.0% of NHANES participants had hypertriglyceridemia
and low HDL plus at least 1 additional criterion. The distri-
bution of the various combinations of abnormalities in those
with metabolic syndrome is shown in Table 2.
Odds Ratio of Each Outcome in HAART and
Non-HAART Users in Nutrition for Healthy
Living Study Versus National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey
HAART users (adjusted OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47 to
0.96) and non-HAART users (adjusted OR = 0.55, 95% CI:
0.33 to 0.93) in the NFHL study were less likely to have
metabolic syndrome compared with NHANES participants
(Table 3). Those using Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) were
equally likely to have metabolic syndrome as those in the
NHANES (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.46 to 2.8; P = 0.76), whereas
those not using lopinavir/ritonavir were less likely to have
metabolic syndrome compared with those in the NHANES
(OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.92; P = 0.02). After adjusting
for BMI, the difference in metabolic syndrome between NFHL
and NHANES participants was no longer statistically sig-
nificant, but the same trend still exists (adjusted OR = 0.77,
95% CI: 0.5 to 1.2).
The odds of having low HDL was 1.6 times higher in
HAART users (adjusted OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.1) in the
NFHL study compared with NHANES participants, and the
odds of having high triglycerides was 2.5 times greater in
HAART users in the NFHL study than in NHANES
participants (adjusted OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.9 to 3.4). Non-
HAARTusers in the NFHL study were also more likely to have
low HDL (adjusted OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.7 to 4.3) than
NHANES participants, but they were equally likely to have
high triglycerides (adjusted OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.6).
High blood pressure was equally common in HAART users
(adjusted OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.2) and non-HAART
users (adjusted OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.3) in the NFHL
study compared with NHANES participants. Abdominal
obesity was significantly less likely in HAART users (adjusted
OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.60) and non-HAART users
(adjusted OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.67) in the NFHL study
compared with NHANES participants. High blood glucose
was also much less common in NFHL participants compared
with NHANES participants regardless of HAART use
(adjusted OR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.11) or non-HAART
use (adjusted OR = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.17). Adjustment
for BMI when evaluating the differences in each component of

the metabolic syndrome between participants of the NFHL
study and NHANES did not change the results.
Incidence of Metabolic Syndrome in Nutrition
for Healthy Living Study
The baseline characteristics of NFHL participants
without metabolic syndrome at baseline (n = 338) are shown
in Table 4 (baseline frequency).
There were 88 new cases of metabolic syndrome over
a total of 7026 person-months of follow-up for an incidence
rate of 1.2 per 100 person-months. Among the 88 new cases of
metabolic syndrome, 84% participants had hypertriglyceride-
mia, 89% had low HDL, 72% had high blood pressure, 37%
had abdominal obesity, and 32% had high glucose.
In the final multivariate model, the risk of developing
metabolic syndrome over follow-up (Table 4) was significantly
higher with an increasing viral burden, lopinavir/ritonavir or
didanosine (ddI) use, increasing weight, greater BMI, and
greater trunk-to-limb fat ratio, adjusted for race, gender, and
age. The risk was significantly lower among those with
a college education. The risk was 80% higher among those
with at least a 0.5-log increase in viral load in the previous
6 months. The risk was 2 times higher in those using
lopinavir/ritonavir or ddI. Even after adjusting for BMI, the
risk was 2-fold higher among those who gained more than
2 kg over the previous 6 months, and the risk increased from
2.3-fold to 4.9-fold with increasing quartile of trunk fat
relative to limb fat.
Duration of individual medications or types of HAART
was not an independent predictor of metabolic syndrome.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is one of the first large studies of
the incidence and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in HIV.
Our results suggest that HIV itself, treatment, and host factors
affect the risk of metabolic syndrome in HIV disease. Among
our cohort of HIV-infected adults, the risk of developing
metabolic syndrome was higher in those with a clinically
relevant increase in viral load ($0.5 log) in the previous 6
months. This association is most likely related to the effect of

HIV on HDL levels,31 because increasing viral load was
associated with decreasing HDL in this cohort. In contrast, the
relation between increasing viral load and metabolic syndrome
does not seem to be mediated by general inflammation caused
by chronic infection for 2 reasons. First, high viral load did not
predict development of metabolic syndrome. Second, in
a separate analysis in our cohort, neither absolute viral load
nor change in viral load was associated with C-reactive protein
(CRP), a marker of generalized inflammation that is associated
with cardiovascular outcomes in the general population.
Specific antiretroviral therapies are known to affect
individual components of the metabolic syndrome adversely,
such as increasing triglycerides (lopinavir/ritonavir,32 nevir-
apine,33 and nelfinavir33) and increasing fasting glucose
(indinavir34 and lopinavir/ritonavir35). Other therapies have
been associated with improvements in metabolic profiles, such
as increases in HDL cholesterol (nevirapine and nelfinavir).33
In our cohort, lopinavir/ritonavir users had a higher risk of
developing metabolic syndrome. This is supported by results
from a cross-sectional study by Jerico et al.10 In contrast to that
study, we found no association between d4T and metabolic
syndrome. There was no association between metabolic
syndrome and indinavir, nelfinavir, or nevirapine in our study.

changes, the increased risk of metabolic syndrome among our
ddI users may reflect the effect of previous treatments on
individuals or may be related to greater disease severity. HIV
patients are generally prescribed ddI after they have failed
other antiretroviral medications because of metabolic side
effects, other toxicities, or uncontrolled viral load.
Obesity is a leading cause of metabolic syndrome in the
general population, and we found that it is an important risk
factor for metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected persons as well.
Many HIV-infected patients maintain or gain weight as they
survive longer with improved treatments. In our cohort, more
than 35% were overweight (BMI: 25­29) and 18% were obese
(BMI $ 30). Less than 2% had a BMI , 18. Body shape was
an equally important risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A
greater amount of trunk fat relative to limb fat increased the
risk of metabolic syndrome, even after adjusting for BMI and
weight gain. Peripheral fat atrophy, as measured by low triceps
skinfold, was not a predictor of metabolic syndrome, however.
This suggests that greater trunk fat is an important risk factor
for metabolic syndrome whether or not there is a significant
loss of peripheral fat. Body shape abnormalities have been
widely noted in HIV since the mid-1990s, including peripheral
fat atrophy and central fat deposition. Our previous data7 and
those of others36,37 suggest that these 2 abnormalities are the
result of separate processes that do not commonly occur
together. The cardiovascular outcomes of lipodystrophy need
further study.
Despite the adverse effects of HIV and antiretroviral
treatments on some components of metabolic syndrome, the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower in our HIV-
infected cohort compared with the US population, even after
adjusting for differences in demographics, physical activity,
and diet between the 2 populations. There are several reasons
why the rate might be lower in HIV. One possible explanation
is that only 2 of the 5 components of metabolic syndrome were
more likely in HIV-infected adults compared with NHANES
participants: metabolic syndrome was mostly (77%) driven by
hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL in HIV. Both abnormalities
have been associated with HIV disease before and after the
introduction of HAART.2­4,38 The present analysis suggests
a strong effect of HIVon low HDL, because HAART and non-
HAART had a higher prevalence of low HDL compared with
that in the NHANES. It also suggests a strong effect of therapy
(but not HIV) on triglyceride levels, because only HAART
users differed from NHANES participants on hypertriglycer-
idemia. Another possible explanation for differences in
metabolic syndrome between the NFHL study and the
NHANES is the higher rate of obesity in the NHANES.
After adjusting for BMI, the difference in metabolic syndrome
between NFHL and NHANES participants was no longer
statistically significant, but a trend still exists. Adjustment for
BMI when evaluating the differences in each component of the
metabolic syndrome between NFHL and NHANES partic-
ipants did not change the results.
Our findings differ from those of 2 small Italian studies
on metabolic syndrome in HIV. These studies compared
HAART patients with HIV-negative blood donors14 and
NHANES participants13 and found an increased prevalence
of metabolic syndrome associated with HIV infection. In
contrast to these studies, our population was not limited to
HAART users and it included a more diverse demographic
group of men and women. These studies may also differ
from ours because HIV-negative blood donors are generally
healthier than the general population, and this could amplify
differences in prevalence. In addition, in contrast to our
analyses, in comparing HAART users with NHANES
participants, the authors of these small Italian studies did
not account for the NHANES sampling scheme in their
analysis, which would affect the standard errors and
diminish differences, nor did they adjust for confounding
factors.
When comparing the prevalence of the other compo-
nents of metabolic syndrome with that of the NHANES, we
found a similar rate of hypertension. Bergersen et al39 found
that patients on HAART had a similar rate of hypertension as
HAART-naive patients and HIV-negative controls. In contrast,
Gazzaruso et al5 found a higher rate of hypertension in
HAART patients compared with age- and sex-matched HIV-
negative blood donors. In another study of HIV-infected
patients on HAART, patients with HIV-associated lipodys-
trophy were more likely to have hypertension than those
without lipodystrophy.40 Abdominal obesity is a commonly
reported component of HIV-associated lipodystrophy,7 and
specific HAART therapies may be implicated in the etiology of
this abnormality.41 Yet, in our cohort, the rates of abdominal
obesity were lower than in the NHANES, even after adjusting
for demographics, physical activity, and dietary factors.
Although lower BMI in the NFHL study may partially explain
the lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the NFHL
study compared with the NHANES, the mechanism is unclear
because the prevalence of abdominal obesity remained lower
in the NFHL study even after adjustment for BMI. This is
supported by the findings of Bachetti et al36 and Gripsolver
et al,37 who found a similar prevalence of abdominal obesity in
HIV compared with population controls in the Cardia Study.
High blood glucose was rarely observed in our cohort (4%)
and was significantly less frequent than in the NHANES.
Indinavir has been associated with insulin resistance,34 but this
agent was only used by 11.5% of persons in our cohort. Indin-
avir users did not have a higher prevalence of high glucose
compared with NHANES participants. Thus, loss of control of
glucose seems to be infrequent and rarely contributes to the
diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in our HIV cohort.
There are several limitations to our analyses. We were
not able to compare our population with NHANES
participants living in the northeastern United States directly,
because this level of detail is not publically available. Our
results may not be generalizable to the entire population of
HIV-infected adults in the United States. Our study protocol
called for a minimum fast of 5 hours before collecting fasting
lipids and glucose, whereas an 8-hour fast was required of
participants in the NHANES. Neither used the 12-hour
standard fast. Chylomicrons may have still been present in the
sera, exaggerating triglyceride levels. In that case, the true rate
of metabolic syndrome might actually be lower in our study,
showing a greater difference between the NFHL study and
NHANES, because participants in the NHANES had a longer
fast. Finally, some of our participants may have had

preexisting risk factors for metabolic syndrome before
becoming HIV-positive. The exact dates of HIV infection
and development of diabetes or hypertension cannot be known
for sure. Nevertheless, at the time of enrollment in the NFHL
study, all 4 people who reported a past history of diabetes said
they were diagnosed with diabetes before they knew they were
HIV-positive. Among those with a previous diagnosis of hy-
pertension at study entry (n = 37), 17 said they were diagnosed
with hypertension before they knew they were HIV-positive. If
we exclude those people with a diagnosis of diabetes or
hypertension before they knew they were infected with HIV,
we again observe a lower rate of metabolic syndrome in HIV-
infected individuals compared with NHANES participants.
We have no data on past waist circumference or lipid levels.
In summary, HIV-infected patients are at risk of
metabolic syndrome, even though the rate is lower than that
in the general population. HIV providers should monitor
patients for factors that indicate a risk of cardiovascular disease
outcomes.
