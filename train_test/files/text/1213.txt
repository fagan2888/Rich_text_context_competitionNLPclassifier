Civic Engagement and Older Adults:
A Critical Perspective
Marty Martinson, MPH, MEd,1 and Meredith Minkler, DrPH, MPH1
The aging of the baby boom generation, together with
research that links volunteerism and positive health
outcomes in later life, has contributed to a burgeoning
of interest in initiatives and programs promoting civic
engagement among older adults. Although useful in
potentially expanding role options in later life, this
growing attention also underscores the importance of
stepping back to critically examine frequently over-
looked questions concerning the framing and potential
consequences of the new emphasis on civic engage-
ment. Following a brief review of semantics and defi-
nitional issues in this area, we use a critical gerontology
framework, emphasizing both political economy analy-
sis and perspectives from the humanities, to explore
underlying questions such as these: What roles are
older adults being encouraged to play in civic life?
What meanings are implied by these roles? What
political and economic forces underlie these roles?
What types of civic engagement are left out of the con-
versation? Our goal is to encourage a broadening of the
dialogue to include potentially problematic normative
and political economic dimensions of civic engagement,
particularly volunteerism, as they pertain to older adults.
Key Words: Civic engagement, Volunteerism,
Health outcomes
The emergent discourse on civic engagement and
older adults among gerontologists, policy makers, and
other stakeholders signifies another marker in the
transformation of how aging is conceptualized and
perceived. As the oldest members of the country's 78-
million-strong baby boom generation approach re-
tirement, the public and private sectors, and the larger
society, are pondering the social, political, and eco-
nomic impacts that the graying of the boomers may
portend. In contrast to the ``apocalyptic demography''
scenario (Robertson, 1990) often favored by the mass
media, proponents of a civic engagement perspective
offer a far more positive assessment. These analysts
argue that, with increased life expectancies and more
education than their parents, ``boomers will enter later
life with many healthy, productive years ahead'' and
``have the potential to become a social resource of
unprecedented proportions by contributing to the civic
life of their communities'' (Harvard School of Public
Health/MetLife Foundation, 2004, p. 8).
In 2004, the Gerontological Society of America
(GSA) and the American Society on Aging (ASA) each
independently launched initiatives to examine and
promote civic engagement among older adults. The
GSA's Initiative on Civic Engagement in an Older
America is a 5-year project supporting ``the study of
civic engagement by experts in the field of aging.'' This
initiative encourages ``research on programs and public

policies likely to increase civic participation among
older adults'' (GSA, 2004). Echoing similar themes but
focused more on practice dimensions, the ASA's Civic
Engagement Project is a 3-year initiative to recognize
the aging population as ``a vast, untapped social re-
source'' and ``to support and encourage civic engage-
ment by elders'' (ASA, 2005).
The burgeoning interest in civic engagement and
older adults underscores the importance of critically
exploring fundamental questions regarding why and
how civic engagement is being promoted, and what this
signifies about perceptions of aging. We begin this
article with a brief review of the semantics of civic
engagement and provide some historical background
on older adult volunteerism. We then demonstrate the
utility of a critical gerontology framework, which
brings together political economy and humanities per-
spectives to explore several unaddressed questions
regarding civic engagement and older adults. As
gerontologists and engaged scholars who are deeply
involved in the conduct and study of an intervention
supporting civic engagement in older Californians, we
approach this task as loving critics. Our goal is to
broaden the dialogue to include the problematic
normative and political economic dimensions of the
civic engagement discourse and, more specifically, the
promotion of volunteerism for older adults. Only by
asking difficult questions can we expand and improve
the options for those who take a civic engagement path
in later life, while supporting those who do not.
Defining Civic Engagement
The term civic engagement has been used in reference
to a wide variety of activities, including voting, being
involved in political campaigns, participating in paid
and unpaid community work, staying up to date on
news and public affairs, and helping one's neighbor.
Capturing some of this breadth, political scientists
Ramakrishnan and Baldassare (2004, p. v) define civic en-
gagement as ``both political participation and civic
volunteerism.'' In the influential report promoting civic
engagement among older adults, Reinventing Aging:
Baby Boomers and Civic Engagement, the Harvard
School of Public Health/MetLife Foundation Initiative
on Retirement and Civic Engagement defines civic
engagement as the process in which individuals are
``actively participating in the life of their communities''
through voting, joining community groups, and volun-
teering (2004, p.3). However, in operationalizing civic
engagement with regard to older adults, the authors
focus solely on the activity of volunteering rather than
offer a more extensive and multifaceted treatment of the
concept. Like many scholars in this emerging field, these
authors use the terms volunteerism and civic engage-
ment interchangeably. When civic engagement is re-
duced to the act of formal volunteering, other activities
associated with civic life, including voting, engaging in
community activism, staying informed about current
events, caregiving, and having informal connections, are
notably ignored. Because this article focuses primarily
on civic engagement as the term is being used in the
contemporary discourse on older adults (that is, in
terms of formal volunteering), we are unable to do
justice to the broader concept here. The semantic issue
becomes important, however, as we explore the roles
older adults are now being encouraged to play in civic
life as community volunteers, the political and economic
forces that underlie these roles, and the types of civic
engagement that often are left out of the conversation.
Historical Context
Although the promotion of civic engagement in
older adults has achieved considerable attention in the
first years of the 21st century, efforts to institutionalize
such engagement through volunteer programs may
be traced to the early 1960s. In 1963, President John
F. Kennedy proposed the development of a National
Service Corps to provide service opportunities for
youth and older persons. At the time, just 1 in 10
individuals was engaged in volunteer service (Freed-
man, 1999). The National Service Corps was to have
served as a ``domestic Peace Corps,'' involving full-time
service for at least 1 year and providing living expenses
for participants, and aimed at addressing poverty. As
Freedman explains, it was the latter provision that
ultimately led to the program's defeat in Congress,
where segregationists characterized it as ``a back door
to racial integration in the South'' (p. 84).
Growing pressure to address poverty in the elderly
population, however, and the realization that involve-
ment of low-income elders in stipendiary service could
help overcome conservative opposition to ``another
government handout'' led to the creation of the Office
of Economic Opportunity's Foster Grandparents Pro-
gram in 1965. Originally designed to provide minimum
wage to low-income seniors working 20 hr a week with
children in settings such as orphanages and hospitals,
the program today involves seniors of all income levels
who provide mentoring, tutoring, and emotional
support to at-risk youth (see http://www.seniorcorps.
org/about/sc/index.asp).
Two other federal programs fostering volunteerism
in older adults also trace their lineage to the 1960s: the
Senior Companionship Program, which gives financial
support to low-income adults aged 60 years and older
who provide in-person services to other seniors in need;
and the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, which
connects volunteers aged 55 years and older with
a range of service opportunities in their communities.
In addition to these three national Senior Corps pro-
grams, through which approximately half a million
seniors volunteer (see http://www.seniorcorps.org/
about/sc/index.asp), a number of other entities have
played an important role in promoting volunteering
among older adults. Organizations such as the Execu-
tive Service Corps (http://www.escus.org), the Experi-
ence Corps (http://www.experiencecorps.org), and the
National Retiree Volunteer Coalition (http://www.
nrvc.org) have helped connect substantial numbers of
seniors to volunteer opportunities in their communities.
Seldom mentioned in the literature on civic engage-
ment and older adults, however, is another type of
Vol. 46, No. 3, 2006 319
organization through which many older Americans
work to foster social change and promote social justice.
Organizations such as the Gray Panthers (http://
www.graypanthers.org), founded in 1972 to fight all
forms of age discrimination and other social injustices,
and the Older Women's League (http://www.owl-
national.org) work to change the systems that foster
inequities in society. The Older Women's League's
motto, ``Don't agonize--Organize!,'' indeed resonates
with many midlife and older Americans for whom civic
engagement means first and foremost building grass-
roots efforts, coalitions, and broad social movements
to create a more just nation and world. As we suggest
in the pages that follow, in ignoring or discounting
the history and contemporary manifestations of such
activities, proponents of civic engagement in older
adults tend to wittingly or unwittingly feed into
a historically conservative vision of volunteerism as
an alternative to welfare-state programs.
Civic Engagement and Baby Boomers:
A Critical Gerontology Perspective
Older adults are being encouraged to become
civically engaged by volunteering in their communities
in part because of the believed benefits of such service to
their health and well-being. Three decades of research
on health and formal volunteer activity have indeed
suggested, as Musick and Wilson (2003, p. 260) point
out, ``a positive, if modest, relationship between the
two'' (see Chappell, 1999, and Morrow-Howell, Hinter-
long, Rozario, & Tang, 2003, for helpful reviews of this
literature). As these and other analysts note (cf. Musick
& Wilson; Thoits & Hewitt, 2001), however, with a few
exceptions, problematic research designs and the lack
of information about diverse populations make it diffi-
cult to ascertain how volunteering is experienced by
different individuals and communities. Further research
clearly is needed to examine interactions between race,
gender, class, and volunteering; how volunteering is
defined and counted; the differential distribution of
benefits; and the causal pathways between volunteering
and health. At the same time, as we already noted, far
more attention also must be paid to broader questions
concerning the political economy context within which
the new emphasis on volunteerism and civic engage-
ment is taking place, the potential impact of this
burgeoning movement on the perceived meanings of
aging and later life, and the ways in which the civic
engagement movement, like the productive aging
movement (Holstein, 1999), may unwittingly devalue
those older adults for whom such engagement is either
not possible or not chosen. It is to these broader and
frequently ignored questions that we now turn.
To broaden the dialogue about these larger ques-
tions, we employ a critical gerontology framework,
described by Baars (1991) as ``a collection of questions,
problems, and analyses that have been excluded
from the established mainstream'' (p. 220). As Chris
Phillipson and Alan Walker (1987) suggest, what is
proposed in critical gerontology is ``a more value
committed approach to social gerontology--a commit-
ment not just to understand the social construction of
ageing but to change it'' (p. 12). Critical gerontology
has been characterized as evolving along two paths
that sometimes intersect but tend to remain distinct
(Minkler, 1996). The political economy path views
aging in broad structural terms and considers how
political and economic contexts and factors such as
race, class, and gender interact to help shape and
determine the experience of aging and growing old
(Calasanti & Slevin, 2001; Estes, Biggs, & Phillipson,
2003; Quadagno & Reid, 1999). The humanities path,
in contrast, is more concerned with putting ``a human
face--and a human body and spirit--on ageing and
growing old'' (Minkler, p. 470). It focuses on the
meaning of aging as understood from the inside out
(Cole, 1992; Holstein, 1999; Moody 1988). Both paths
offer useful insights into the rationale for, and poten-
tial pitfalls of, the new emphasis on civic engagement
and volunteerism in later life.
Traveling critical gerontology's political economy
path, we begin by situating the new push for civic
engagement and volunteerism among older Americans
within its broader sociopolitical context: the politics
of retrenchment that have been a central feature of
American political and economic life over the past three
decades. From this perspective, it is no accident that the
view of older Americans as ``a growing yet largely
untapped civic resource for responding to community
needs through both paid and unpaid work'' (GSA, 2004)
has emerged with the decline of the welfare state. The
federal government's diminished funding for many
social services and public programs places greater
responsibilities on already deficit-ridden states and
municipalities, which in turn often call on individuals,
families, and volunteerism to help take up the slack. The
renewed call for older adult volunteers has emerged in
part from this devolution, and it suggests a new twist on
productive aging models that have become increasingly
popular in gerontology. As Holstein (1999) suggests, ``In
a society witnessing a shift in both political and moral
economics, the productive aging scenario can become
the unintended handmaiden for a political agenda that
delegitimizes old age benefits'' (p. 366). This too can be
said for the civic engagement scenario as older adults are
called on to be useful and to counter budgetary
shortfalls through volunteering while their own safety
nets are disintegrating.
The economic and political imperative behind the
new emphasis on civic engagement and older volun-
teerism is acknowledged in a number of key writings in
this field in the United States (Freedman, 2002; Jirovec
& Hyduk, 1998), Canada (Chappell, 1999), and the
United Kingdom (Anheier & Salamon, 2001; Biggs,
2001) that note the desperate economic need to fill
gaps in services and systems now vacated or severely
underfunded by government. For example, Chappell's
assessment of the impact of changing fiscal policies on
volunteerism rings as true in the United States as it does
in her native Canada:
The devolution of service programs, previously
provided by government to the voluntary sector,
has enormously increased pressure and opportunities
320 The Gerontologist
for the voluntary sector. The partial withdrawal of
government responsibility has meant that adminis-
trative and financial responsibility for the social
safety net for vulnerable persons and groups now falls
to the community. (p. 8)
In the United States, Jirovec and Hyduk (1998)
similarly assert that we are ``in an era of diminishing
governmental responsibility for the human services,''
raising concerns among social welfare professionals
who are ``likely to have more involvement with non-
profit, voluntary agencies, and more duties related to
the development and evaluation of volunteer programs
and services'' (p. 29). Morrow-Howell (2000) suggests
that older adults may have to take the responsibility for
filling these service needs, stating, ``Growing social
problems and reduced public expenditures will demand
increased volunteerism. . . . Thus, our society may
require the productive engagement of older adults''
(p. 1).
Civic Ventures founder and president Marc Freed-
man (2002), one of the most visible champions of civic
engagement for older adults in the United States, offers
a more positive perspective on the ``daunting human-
resource shortages that exist all across the nonprofit
and public-service sector.'' He suggests that older
volunteers ``might well produce a windfall for Amer-
ican communities in the 21st century . . . [and] along the
way bring opportunities for greater fulfillment and
purpose in later years'' (p. 86).
There is indeed recognition among scholars in the
field of civic engagement and volunteerism that the
economic imperative serves as a powerful motivator
for the current promotion of volunteering in later life.
However, for many proponents of initiatives pro-
moting civic engagement and older volunteerism, this
recognition is not followed by a deeper look at what
the economic imperative suggests. Do the politics of
retrenchment and devolution, and the resulting cut-
backs in health and human services, mean that older
people now have a responsibility to be productive and
to give back to the community through civic engage-
ment and volunteering? Who is being served by
recruiting older adults in large numbers to fill these
service needs? If federal and state governments are
taking away resources that support the community
good, is the answer to have older people--many
of whom have already been negatively and dispro-
portionately affected by these cutbacks--step in to
fill those unmet needs, thereby releasing govern-
ment of long-term responsibility? Does such a sub-
stitution of resources even accomplish what it is being
set up to do?
Among the few American scholars who have
critically examined such questions, political scientists
Theiss-Morse and Hibbing (2004) argue that ``Volun-
teering in a soup kitchen will help hungry individuals in
a town but will do nothing to address broader prob-
lems of homelessness and poverty'' (pp. 237Â­238).
These analysts assert that a narrow focus on volunteer-
ing, viewed by many as a helping activity and not
a political activity, serves to devalue and detract from
the necessity of other types of civic engagement, such as
political involvement to promote increased governmen-
tal responsibility and action to address basic human
needs. As social historian Theodore Roszak (2001)
further points out,
[V]olunteerism is not politically neutral; it has
always been closely linked to conservative values
as the glowing alternative to mandatory govern-
ment programs. Voluntary service is the rich man's
substitute for the welfare state and is often falsely
opposed to government, as if the two must be at
odds. (p. 125)
From this perspective, presenting older volunteers as
a primary resource for addressing fundamental social
and economic problems is misleading and dangerous,
letting government off the hook in the provision of
basic goods and services for the community and, in
particular, for its most vulnerable members.
In his critical look at the emergence of social policies
and public discourse promoting volunteerism and
productive or positive aging in Britain, Biggs (2001)
offers a similar analysis. Utilizing a critical narrativity
framework, he asks, ``How does social policy, and the
stories it tells, influence the spaces in which we might
grow old?'' (p. 303). Bringing to bear both political
economy and humanities perspectives, he examines
why and how ``the British Government has embarked
upon a large, if not to say baffling, array of initiatives
to promote positive aging'' (p. 307). Similar to the
productive aging discourse in the United States, the
positive aging perspective in Britain evolved in part
as images of aging as frailty and dependence on the
welfare state gave way in the 1990s to new perceptions
of the elderly as a potent ``grey market'' with ``the
capacity to participate much more effectively in a
variety of social arenas than we previously thought
possible'' (p. 307). In Britain, as in other parts of
Western Europe and the United States, the ``aging
population is being redefined as a social, political and
economic opportunity'' (p. 310), with older citizens
valued for their ability to contribute to the market
economy through paid or unpaid workforce participa-
tion. The emerging social policies promoting paid work
and volunteer opportunities for older adults both create
and reflect a new public discourse on what it means to
be old. In Biggs' words,
We are told a story of autonomous older people,
actively involved in their communities, achieving joy
through the return of work and voluntary activities.
It also appears that later life is being defined as
a relatively homogeneous part of the life course,
beginning at approximately age 50. Work-like
activities are presented as a sort of social therapy
that capitalizes on postmodern aging and simulta-
neously draws older people back into the social
mainstream. Another marginalized group is saved!
(p. 311)
The danger of this story is that it ignores the
diversity of the aging population, the ways in which
society's structural and social forces advance opportu-
nities for some and limit them for others, and the
Vol. 46, No. 3, 2006 321
economic and political incentives for utilizing older
volunteers. Further, it ignores the effects of this social
construction of aging, as defined by one's productivity,
on the lives of those who are growing old. By putting
forth a view of volunteerism and lifelong labor as
normative ideals to which older people should aspire,
society tacitly devalues the worth of those older people
who cannot or choose not to engage in such activity.
It is in the latter regard that the humanities path in
critical gerontology offers useful insights, attending as
it does to questions of how we value aging and raising
questions of the meaning of later life from the
perspective of those who live it.
Such questions were cast in stark relief by ``Mary,''
an older woman who called in to a radio talk show
featuring civic engagement proponent and scholar
Marc Freedman (2002). As he tells the story, Mary
disagreed with his perspective on the healthiness and
desirability of being productive in late life. In Freed-
man's words, ``She was someone who had worked hard
since age 16, for more than 40 years functioning as
a paragon of productivity, only opting to put on the
brakes when her boss persisted in heaping greater and
greater responsibility on her. Finally, she said, `That's
it,' and retired'' (p. 87). Freedman explained that Mary
was exhausted and ``was offended by what sounded
like my exhortation to take on more duties, make
contributions, do more work'' (p. 87). He acknowl-
edged the validity of this woman's concern, and
explained that his intention is to ``expand opportunities
and options, not obligations . . . [to] widen the range of
compelling pathways available to individuals in later
life'' (p. 87).
Freedman's response to Mary is commendable in
suggesting that volunteerism and civic engagement
should be viewed as opening new opportunities, not an
admonition to follow a particular path. However, the
questions of how this promotion of productivity may
be read as expectations and how this may then affect
the lives of older adults like Mary remain unaddressed.
Furthermore, the issue is oversimplified, and therefore
missed, when it is reduced to being a matter of choice.
Freedman suggests, ``Not everyone will want to pursue
public service in later life. Some will prefer to hit the
[golf] links, while others will choose to do nothing
at all. It is their privilege'' (p. 87). This assertion that
``it is their privilege'' not to volunteer misses the fact
that some older people do not have a choice due in
part to their lack of privilege in a market economy
that discriminates against people by class, race,
gender, age, and health status (Estes et al., 2003;
Quadagno & Reid, 1999). For many, having to serve
as a full-time caregiver for a partner or parent with
Alzheimer's disease, unexpectedly being called upon
to raise one's grandchildren, or having to work in
a minimum-wage job simply to make ends meet may
sharply constrain choice in relation to valued volun-
teer activities.
In their recent study, The Ties that Bind: Changing
Demographics and Civic Engagement in California,
Ramakrishnan and Baldassare (2004) explore the
differential involvement of diverse communities in civic
volunteerism and political activities. In examining the
issue of choice, they give this explanation:
[A]lthough civic engagement may involve acts of
individual choice, these choices are often structured
by various social, economic, and institutional
factors. Thus, for instance, poverty and lack of
education mean fewer skills that are relevant to
political participation and fewer opportunities to
be mobilized into participation in political activities
and volunteerism. (p. 1)
A critical gerontology framework enables us to raise
important questions about how the burgeoning move-
ment for late-life volunteerism sits within a political
and historical context, and to consider the ways in
which social and structural factors influence one's choice
or ability to volunteer or be productive in a socially
valued manner. Within a humanities context, we also
must ask how the emphasis on volunteering as a desir-
able, or even required, activity to achieve a more mean-
ingful later life may affect the self-images of older people
and society's images of what aging should look like. In
his critique of Britain's policy narrative that emphasizes
civic engagement and active aging as the means by which
an older life has social value, Biggs (2001) points out
that other meaningful and very personal experiences of
late life are thereby devalued and even contradicted:
Interpretations of the life tasks of maturity that
emphasize other potentialities surrounding aging--
spirituality (Howse, 1999), gero-transcendence
(Tornstam, 1996), ``the well-earned rest'' and
contemplation through ``coming to terms with
oneself''--may not be compatible with an active/
positive narrative of productive aging. (p. 313)
Similarly, Holstein (1999) points to research in
cultural psychology, anthropology, and philosophy
that suggests ``cultural messages which elevate an ideal
of productive aging can easily subvert--or, at a mini-
mum, complicate--an older person's ability to find
coherence and purpose in the face of frailty and dis-
ability'' (p. 367). In addition to preventing individuals
from embracing all the possibilities of the aging process,
notions like productive aging and civic engagement
in later life may limit what gerontologists and society
can learn about aging and may contribute to a less
respectful view of older persons. In Holstein's words,
By assuming the desirability of productivity and
reducing the vision of an aging society to it,
advocates bypass a critical task--to understand
aging in all its manifestations and to respect elders
not only when they are contributing in any way
elucidated to date, but also when they become more
dependent. (p. 367)
The growing movement to institutionalize volun-
teering and civic engagement among older Americans
must be approached with thoughtfulness and a critical
eye for whether such efforts are as healthy and
empowering as current promotions suggest. The
authors of Reinventing Aging engage in some reflection
on the dangers of the active aging paradigm, stating
that, in an attempt to counter previous decline and loss
322 The Gerontologist
images of late life, ``society may have too willingly
embraced the contrasting image of the `active senior'--
indefatigable, healthy, usually wealthy, and eternally
young'' (Harvard School of Public Health/MetLife
Foundation, 2004, p. 5). However, the authors do not
retreat from their presumption of productive aging as
being desirable, good, and empowering. As they assert,
Productive aging will require careful planning by
individual boomers. An organized effort could help
boomers envision, and plan for, a life that achieves
meaning in their later years by connecting in new
ways to the larger community around them. (p. 5)
The implication here is that, without a plan for
productivity, one cannot have ``a life that achieves
meaning in their later years.'' Again, this paradigm
ignores other ways of achieving meaning, fulfillment,
and peace as one ages.
Without underplaying the value of civic engagement
and volunteerism for those who choose such a path in
later life, and the value of efforts such as the GSA's
recent initiative to expand options for such engagement,
we caution that an overemphasis on civic engagement
and volunteerism in later life, like the earlier emphasis
on productive aging, can contribute to the stigmatiza-
tion and disempowerment of those elders who fail to
meet our criteria for ``a good old age'' (Cruikshank,
2003; Holstein & Minkler, 2003; Katz, 2000). Such
stigmatization and disempowerment may negatively
impact the well-being of individuals and communities,
as it implicitly suggests that older people may be of
lesser value if they are not able to contribute, whether
in paid or unpaid capacities, in the market economy.
Summary and Conclusion
From our stance as loving critics, we have used
a critical gerontology framework to highlight some
of the less frequently asked questions regarding the
meaning and significance of the new emphasis on civic
engagement and older adults. Although we did not
intend this discussion as a detailed treatment of these
issues, we offered it as an attempt to broaden the
dialogue on civic engagement and older adults and to
move it into some largely uncharted terrain.
Although this conversation remains in its infancy,
several initial recommendations may be offered. First,
although volunteerism and other forms of civic
engagement should not be required of older adults,
those who are interested in participating should be
encouraged and enabled to do so. For low-income
individuals who wish to volunteer but for whom there
may be economic impediments, the provision of
government stipends to make such participation
possible should be expanded. At minimum, reimburse-
ment for transportation and other volunteer-related
expenses should be provided to those for whom desired
participation might otherwise be a hardship.
Second, and at the same time, we should be critically
aware of how programs stressing civic engagement
and volunteerism in older adults may impact and reflect
the social significance of later life. In the words of
ter Meulen and colleagues (1994), ``The societal role
assigned to the elderly and the public programs
developed on their behalf, will not only influence the
self-perception of the aged, but will also project
a picture of the value placed on them by society'' (p.
S10). To help foster such critical awareness, the forums
in which the virtues of civic engagement and older
adults increasingly are being discussed should be
expanded to include frank discussions of the potential
pitfalls and limitations of this approach, and how these
may be addressed.
Third, we must consciously expand conventional
notions of civic engagement to include the work of
organizations such as the Gray Panthers and other
grassroots movements led by older adults that focus on
broad social change objectives. As Gray Panthers
founder Maggie Kuhn (1991) asserted, ``The old,
having the benefit of life experience, the time to get
things done, and the least to lose by sticking their necks
out, [are] in a perfect position to serve as advocates for
the larger public good'' (p. 38). All too often, such
efforts are left out of the discourse on civic engagement,
whose political roots have favored individually focused
social betterment over broader institutional and policy-
level change initiatives.
Finally, the creation of an environment honoring
and enabling diverse civic engagement opportunities
must be broadened still further to respect those elders
who do not volunteer, for whatever reasons, in order
that we may embrace aging in all its forms, lives,
abilities, and meanings. For in last analysis, a real
commitment to a good and satisfying later life would
mean ``recognizing and reinforcing the essential mean-
ing of old age,'' which transcends things such as
whether or not people volunteer and involves more
fundamentally the right to flourish and grow and ``live
a good old age'' in whatever ways are possible and
desired (Minkler, 2000, p. 454). Part of creating an
honoring environment means involving older people, in
all their diversity, in determining how our social
institutions and ways of living can reflect a broader
appreciation for all older adults, regardless of whether
or not they are civically engaged.
As gerontologists, we must continue to advocate for
and develop programs and policies that promote an
environment respectful of older people for who they
are, not simply for what they can contribute. Such an
environment would enable older people to live with
dignity and to create their own meanings for later life.
For some, that will include volunteer work and other
forms of civic engagement. For others, it will not.
