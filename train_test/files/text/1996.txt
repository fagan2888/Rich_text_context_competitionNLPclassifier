African Americans have higher prevalence of chronic kid-
ney disease than non-Hispanic whites.1 Higher prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes contribute to, but do not appear to
fully explain, this disparity.2,3 Recently published national data
confirm that blacks with both hypertension and prehyperten-
sion have higher rates of early kidney disease as indicated by
microalbuminuria.4 The reasons for racial disparities in micro-
albuminuria are not known.
Emerging data link low serum vitamin D status to hyperten-
sion,5­8 albuminuria,9,10 and chronic renal disease.11,12 Potential
mechanisms include stimulation of renin production,13 vascular
smooth muscle proliferation,14 inflammation,13 thrombosis,15
and impairment in endothelial function.16,17
Given unexplained racial disparities in microalbuminuria and
well documented disparities in serum vitamin D status,18 we
examined the hypothesis that low vitamin D might account for
racial differences in albuminuria and also microalbuminuria.
Methods
Participants. We examined data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from
2001­2006. Because of our focus on racial disparity in albu-
minuria, we confined our analysis to participants who self-
reported their ethnicity and race as non-Hispanic white or
black.
Our sample included 7,651 adult participants (20 years and
older) who participated in the interview and examination
and for whom blood pressure (BP), vitamin D status, urinary
albumin, and creatinine values were available. We excluded
participants with chronic kidney disease (defined as esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate <60) and females who were
pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test or self-reported preg-
nancy). In secondary analyses, we excluded participants with
macroalbuminuria and also those with elevated parathyroid
hormone (PTH) (>74 pg/ml).19

Vitamin D and Racial Disparity in Albuminuria:
NHANES 2001­2006
Kevin A. Fiscella1,2, Paul C.Winters1 and Gbenga Ogedegbe3
Background
National data show unexplained racial disparity in albuminuria.We
assessed whether low serum vitamin D status contributes to racial
disparity in albuminuria.
Methods
We examined the association between race and albuminuria (spot
urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) 30) among non-Hispanic
black and white nonpregnant adults who were free of renal
impairment in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 2001­2006.We conducted analyses without and with
serum 25(OH)D.We adjusted for age, sex, education level, smoking,
body mass index (BMI), diabetes, diagnosis of hypertension, and use
of antihypertensive medication.
Results
Albuminuria was present in 10.0% of non-Hispanic blacks and
6.6% in non-Hispanic whites. Being black (odds ratio (OR) 1.46; 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.23­1.73) was independently associated
with albuminuria.There was a graded, inverse association between
25(OH)D level and albuminuria. Notably, the association between
race and albuminuria was no longer significant (OR 1.19; 95% CI
0.97­1.47) after accounting for participants'serum 25(OH)D. Similar
results were observed when participants with macroalbuminuria
(ACR 300mg/g) or elevated parathyroid hormone (>74 pg/ml) were
excluded or when a continuous measure of 25(OH)D was substituted
for the categorical measure.There were no interactions between
race and vitamin D status though racial disparity in albuminuria was
observed among participants with the highest 25(OH)D levels.
Conclusion
Suboptimal vitamin D status may contribute to racial disparity in
albuminuria. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine
whether supplementation with vitamin analogues reduces risk for
albuminuria or reduce racial disparity in this outcome.

Vitamin D and Disparities in Albuminuria
sized arm cuffs.20­22 Readings were taken from participants
while sitting after 5min of rest. In determining mean BP, the
first reading was used if only one measurement was obtained;
the second reading was used if two readings were taken; and if
more than two readings were taken, values were averaged over
the last two when available.20­22
Participants were defined as having treated hypertension
if they reported taking antihypertensive medications and
untreated if they did not. Among untreated participants, BP
was classified using the Seventh Joint National Committee
for Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High BP (JNC-7) guidelines23: normal (systolic BP (SBP) was
<120mmHg and the diastolic BP (DBP) was <80mmHg),
prehypertension (SBP of 120­139mmHg or DBP of
80­89mmHg), stage 1 hypertension (SBP of 140­159mmHg
or DBP of 90­99mmHg), and stage 2 hypertension (SBP of
160mmHg or DBP of 100mmHg). Participants taking
antihypertensive drugs were considered to have controlled BP
if their SBP was <140mmHg and their DBP was <90mmHg.
Vitamin D status. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using a radi-
oimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN). The coefficient
of variation for the years 2001­2006 ranged from 10­13% and
the sensitivity for the 25(OH)D assay was 1.5ng/ml).24 The
serum 25(OH)D was adjusted for assay drift using methods
recommended by the National Center for Health Statistics.25
Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the biologically active
form of vitamin D, serum 25(OH)D is regarded as the best
indicator of vitamin D status in individuals without kidney
disease.26 We grouped 25(OH)D into the following categories:
<25, 25­49, 50­74, 75­99, and 100nmol/l.
Albuminuria. The untimed urinary albumin/creatinine ratio
(ACR) was classified as normal if ACR <30mg/g, microalbu-
minuria if ACR is between 30­299mg/g, and macroalbuminu-
ria if ACR 300mg/g.27 In addition to predicting progression
of renal disease, albuminuria (both micro and macro) predicts
cardiovascular disease.28 The definition of ACR was based on
the criteria of the National Kidney Foundation.29 The rationale
for using ACR of 30mg/g and above is based on evidence that
microalbuminuria is a predictor of cardiovascular disease and
end organ damage.30
In our primary analysis, we combined participants with
micro and macroalbuminuria into a single category: albu-
minuria. In secondary analyses, we focused on microalbu-
minuria by excluding participants with macroalbuminuria
from the analysis.
Race. Race and Hispanic ethnicity were assessed by self-report
and were categorized as white (non-Hispanic) or black (non-
Hispanic). Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and par-
ticipants who self-identified with more than one race/ethnic
group were not included in this study.
Control variables. We adjusted for potential confounding by
including variables associated with albuminuria and vitamin D.
These include age, sex, smoking, body mass index (BMI), BP,
and diabetes.31­36 This represents a conservative approach since
some of these variables may be affected by serum 25(OH)D
levels.
Age at screening was grouped into categories of 20­34,
35­44, 45­54, 55­64, and those 65 years and older. Smoking
status was defined as never smoked, current smoker, and
former smoker. BMI was determined based on participants
assessed weight (kg) and height (m) and categorized (<25.0;
25.0­29.9; 30kg/m2). Diabetes mellitus was defined by self-
report of physician diagnosis or current use of medications for
diabetes mellitus.
Statistical analyses. Analyses were conducted with SUDAAN
(version 10.01) and Stata (version 10.1, College Station, TX),
adjusting for the complex survey design of NHANES to yield
appropriate standard errors and population parameter esti-
mates. We examined the independent association of race with
albuminuria (present or not) using logistic regression mod-
els. We compared the black-white differences in log odds of
albuminuria before and after adjustment for 25(OH)D. We
assessed interactions between 25(OH)D and race and between
25(OH) D and BMI. We also conducted analyses stratified
by serum 25(OH)D levels to examine possible differences in
effects by race. Finally, we conducted several secondary analy-
ses. For this purpose, we repeated our analyses using micro-
albuminuria as a dependent variable, and excluding those with
macroalbuminuria. We also repeated the analyses excluding
those with elevated PTH and also using 25(OH)D as a con-
tinuous variable.
The model was checked for multicollinearity and no prob-
lem existed (all variance inflation factors <2). Since all of our
independent variables are categorical, logit plots for linearity
assessment were not needed. Independence is assumed due to
the strict sampling methodology used by the NHANES group.
Inspection of residuals did not reveal any influential outliers.
In addition, a Hosmer­Lemeshow Goodness-of-fit 2 statistic
of 4.06, P = 0.8516 indicates that our model fits the data well.
Results
Our final sample included 7,651 non-Hispanic blacks and
non-Hispanic whites, ages 20 years and older. Rates of miss-
ing data ranged from 0.01% for diabetes to 0.65% for estimated
glomerular filtration rate. Albuminuria was missing for 3.5%
of participants. Age, BP, and smoking were independently
associated with missing albuminuria data. Twenty five percent
of blacks had 25(OH)D levels below 25nmol/l compared to
only 2% of whites.
The overall prevalence of albuminuria in the total sample
was 7.0%. Its prevalence was 10.0% among blacks and 6.6%
among whites. Table 1 compares the characteristics of partici-
pants with and without albuminuria. As expected, those with
hypertension, older than 55, less education, obese, diabetes,
and those with lower serum 25(OH)D levels had higher preva-
lence of albuminuria. Figure 1 compares 25(OH)D levels by
race. Blacks clustered in the lowest levels of 25(OH)D.

Race is a significant risk factor for albuminuria (Table 2).
Blacks had a 46% greater odds of albuminuria (odds ratio (OR)
1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23­1.73) than whites after
adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking, BMI, diabetes,
BP, and hypertension treatment status. Other risk factors for
albuminuria besides race included older age, diabetes, BP, and
smoking.
When vitamin D categories were added to the model, it
showed a graded, inverse relationship with albuminuria.
The lowest level was associated with a 2.4 higher odds for
albuminuria compared to levels >100nmol/l. Notably, the
association between race and albuminuria was no longer sta-
tistically significant after accounting for serum 25(OH)D (OR
1.19; 95% CI 0.97­1.47). We observed similar effects when
we used a continuous measure of 25(OH)D. Each nmol/l unit
increase in 25(OH)D is associated with a 1% decreased odds
for albuminuria (P < 0.01).
When we excluded participants with macroalbuminuria, we
observed a similar relationship between race and microalbu-
minuria (OR 1.37; 95% CI 0.97­1.47) and a similar attenua-
tion with adjustment for 25(OH)D status (OR 1.11; (95% CI
0.90­1.37). Similar results were also observed for the subsam-
ple (N = 2,375) where those with elevated PTH were excluded.
Vitamin D status continued to show a graded inverse relation-
ship with albuminuria. Similarly, the adjusted OR for race
declined from 1.56 to 1.41. However, CIs were wider and over-
lapped 1.0 for these analyses based on a smaller subsample
(N = 2,355).
There was no statistically significant interactions between
race and 25(OH)D (measured either as categorical or continu-
ous measure) or between race and BMI or BP. However, when
we stratified the analyses by 25(OH)D level, blacks showed
statistically significant higher rates of albuminuria only at
25(OH)D levels 75nmol/l (P < 0.03). Among participants

Vitamin D and Disparities in Albuminuria
with 25(OH)D levels 75nmol/l, blacks showed higher crude
prevalence than whites for albuminuria (13.3% vs. 4.9%). This
effect persisted after adjusting for age, sex, education, smoking,
BMI, BP, and diabetes (P < 0.03). However, only nine blacks
were in this category, i.e., had 25(OH)D levels 75nmol/l.
Discussion
Reasons for disparity in albuminuria between blacks and
whites are not fully known. Given emerging data linking
low serum vitamin D status to albuminuria,9,10 and develop-
ment of kidney disease,11,12 we examined the hypothesis that

original contributions Vitamin D and Disparities in Albuminuria
vitamin D explains the association between race and albu-
minuria in a national sample of black and white adults. The
findings reported in this study confirm our hypothesis that
vitamin D contributes to the noted racial disparity in albu-
minuria. Consistent with a previous report,4 we observed
significantly higher prevalence of albuminuria among non-
Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites. We
confirmed previous risk factors for albuminuria including
older age, diabetes, BP, and smoking.31,32 Unexpectedly, the
association of BMI and albuminuria was not statistically sig-
nificant. This could represent adjustment for factors in the
causal path between BMI and albuminuria (e.g., diabetes and
BP) and/or inadequate statistical power.
As reported in a previous study,9 we also observed a graded,
inverse response between 25(OH)D levels and albuminuria.
The lowest levels were associated with the highest prevalence
of albuminuria. Our findings did not change when partici-
pants with macroalbuminuria or elevated PTH were excluded
from the analyses.
Notably, when we adjusted for serum 25(OH)D, the rela-
tionship between race and albuminuria was no longer sta-
tistically significant. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that 25(OH)D may partly mediate the association between
race and albuminuria. This finding is broadly consistent
with a growing body of evidence suggesting that suboptimal
vitamin D status is associated with vascular-related condi-
tions that are more prevalent among blacks. These include
hypertension,37 diabetic nephropathy,10 peripheral vascular
disease,38 kidney disease progressing to renal failure,11 and
cardiovascular diseases39 and mortality.40
Endothelial dysfunction represents a possible underlying
mechanism of the effects of low vitamin D levels on albu-
minuria. Emerging data suggest that low vitamin D levels are
associated with endothelial dysfunction and its correction alle-
viates this dysfunction.16,41­44 Albuminuria is associated with
endothelial dysfunction including impaired vascular func-
tion.45,46 Intriguingly, blacks have higher rates of endothelial
dysfunction and small vessel disease than whites.47,48 Thus, it
is conceivable that suboptimal vitamin D status among blacks
might contribute to disparities in vascular-related conditions
via endothelial dysfunction as manifested in part through
albuminuria.
Anthropological data suggest an evolutionary link between
race and vitamin D consistent with an interaction between
health outcomes, skin color, and latitude offering further
plausibility for this provocative hypothesis. Vitamin D levels
in response to ultraviolet (UV) exposure from the sun may
have played a pivotal role in the evolution of differences in
skin pigment that emerged based on continental ancestry.49
At low latitudes where UV exposure is high, dark skin pig-
ment from higher concentrations of melanin may protect the
skin and circulating blood folate.50 As human populations
moved north with less intense UV exposure, selection pres-
sures from vitamin D deficiency resulted in lighter skin pig-
ment. Reductions in UV exposure from northern residence
and less exposure (more in door activity and greater use of
sun protection) appear to be associated with rising preva-
lence of vitamin D deficiency.51 Consistent with the findings
from our study sample, vitamin D levels are lowest among
blacks.52
These findings are subject to several important caveats. First,
because our findings are based on cross-sectional data, we can-
not determine the temporal relationship between 25(OH)D lev-
els and albuminuria. A previous study showed that low vitamin
D levels at baseline predicts progression of kidney disease up
to 16 years later.11 Such results are conceivable given the rela-
tive stability of serum 25(OH)D levels over time.53,54 Second,
we cannot exclude the potential for confounding; it is possible
that vitamin D is simply a marker for other factors associated
with albuminuria. However, findings from a small randomized
controlled trial suggest the possibility of a causal relationship,
such that supplementation with the vitamin D analog, parical-
citol, reduced albuminuria among persons with chronic kidney
disease.44 Third, the use of a single untimed ACR sample may
underestimate albumin excretion among blacks (due to higher
creatinine excretion).55,56 Thus, use of ACR to assess kidney dis-
ease provides a conservative estimate of this racial disparity. Last,
although we did not observe a statistically significant interaction
between race and 25(OH)D, we observed a statistically signifi-
cant effect of race and albuminuria only at 25(OH)D levels equal
to or above 75nmol/l. Whether this represents a chance finding
or a differential effect by race, it has implications for the extent to
which vitamin D status might contribute to this disparity. There
is some evidence for vitamin D economy among blacks for bone
turnover and formation, meaning that blacks maintain bone
health at lower levels of vitamin D.57 Further study is needed to
determine whether this holds for other outcomes. In particular,
interventional trials are needed to both confirm a causal role of
vitamin D status in albuminuria for both whites and blacks and
determine whether there is a threshold effect.
In conclusion, vitamin D status may contribute to racial
disparity in albuminuria. Randomized controlled trials are
needed to determine whether supplementation with vitamin
analogues will prevent albuminuria or mitigate racial disparity
in albuminuria.
