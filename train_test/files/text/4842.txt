Article
This study was designed to investigate a number of theoreti-
cal propositions based on a collection of essays by Urie
Bronfenbrenner from the mid-1990s to the 2000s that high-
light a metamorphosis in his ecological systems theory to a
bioecologicalmodelofhumandevelopment(Bronfenbrenner,
1994, 1995b, 1999; Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994;
Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000; Bronfenbrenner & Morris,
2006). One reason for our investigation is that, two relatively
recent essays have drawn attention to the misunderstandings
and (mis)application of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological the-
ory (Darling, 2007; Tudge, Mokrova, Hatfield, & Karnik,
2009). Tudge et al. (2009) in a review of 25 studies that used
Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory concluded that only four
of those tested the more recent forms of the theory. They
concluded that to avoid misleading readers, investigators
should clearly specify (a) whether they are using
Bronfenbrenner's "older ecological theory" or the "newer
bioecological model," and (b) which portions of the older or
newer model are used in an investigation.
Another reason for this examination is that not all aspects
of Bronfenbrenner's (1995a, 1995b; Bronfenbrenner & Ceci,
1994; Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000) theory have been
investigated. For example, Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn
(2000) argued that there is limited research examining meso-
systems; specifically, the association between neighborhoods
and family/parenting--two microsystems that contain the
developing child and are salient to children's development.
Consequently, we examine how aspects of the microsys-
tem--neighborhoods, parenting, and family factors are asso-
ciated. We also examine Bronfenbrenner's arguments
(Bronfenbrenner, 1995a; Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994;
Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000) that proximal processes
exert a more powerful influence on developmental outcomes
than contextual factors, and that the influence of proximal
processes vary as a function of the person, context, and
developmental outcome.
We were also motivated for this undertaking by
Bronfenbrenner's (1995a) suggestion that he hoped his work
"would impel others to seek closure and yield scientific
insights" (pp. 619-620). Thus, we are challenged to examine
aspects of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory bearing in
mind that all the varied aspects of his theory cannot be exam-
ined in a single investigation (Bronfenbrenner, 1999).
Before proceeding with our investigation, we first outline
the main elements of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory,

Child Social Development in Context:
An Examination of Some Propositions in
Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Theory
Godwin S. Ashiabi1 and Keri K. O'Neal2
Abstract
In his later writings, Bronfenbrenner revised his ecological theory, resulting in the bioecological model that gave prominence
to proximal processes and the relationship between the context and individual characteristics. Drawing on the bioecological
model, we hypothesized that (a) contextual influences will be mediated by proximal processes, (b) proximal processes
will have a more powerful impact on children's development than contextual factors, and (c) the effect of contextual and
proximal processes will vary as a function of child characteristic and developmental outcome. Data used were from a sample
of 28,064 six- to eleven-year-olds in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. A multigroup structural equation model
that employed a process-person-context research design was used to analyze the data. In general, support was found for the
meditational hypothesis and the hypothesis that the impact of contextual factors and proximal processes varies as a function
of person and the developmental outcome. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that proximal processes exert a
more powerful effect on development than contextual factors.

starting with his ecological systems view of human develop-
ment to its current focus on proximal processes and sug-
gested research designs for examining the theory. We then
lay out our hypotheses for this investigation based on propo-
sitions outlined in Bronfenbrenner's theory. After that, we
examine research that links the contextual aspects of
Bronfenbrenner's theory to proximal processes, and ulti-
mately, children's socioemotional development.
In its earliest inception, Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological
model (Bronfenbrenner, 1977b, 1979) gave prominence of
place to the environment and divided an individual's envi-
ronment into nested and interrelated systems: the microsys-
tem, mesosystem, macrosystem, and exosystem. The
microsystem is the immediate environment in which the
child lives. Microsystems include any immediate relation-
ships or organizations the child interacts with, such as, the
family, peer group, or school setting. The mesosystem
describes interrelationships between different microsystems.
For example, parental involvement in children's schooling
can have a positive influence on children's academic compe-
tence through children's valuing of academics. The exosys-
tem level has indirect effect on an individual's developmental
outcome and is the setting in which the individual does not
actively participate. Examples of the exosystem include the
parents' workplace. Events happening at the workplace can
affect children through how parents interact with their chil-
dren. Bronfenbrenner's final level is the macrosystem. It
involves the society, and includes cultural values and
describes the economic conditions under which families live
(Bronfenbrenner, 1976), along with material resources, and
opportunity structures (Bronfenbrenner, 1994). The interre-
lations among these nested environments allow for examina-
tion of how patterns of interactions within these systems
influence each other and affect individuals' developmental
outcomes (Bronfenbrenner, 1977a, 1979).
Bronfenbrenner refined and revised his theory to what
would come to be known as his bioecological model. During
this time, more concern was given to differentiating between
the concepts of environment, the person, proximal process,
and the concept of time as they relate to human development
(Bronfenbrenner, 1995a, 1999; Bronfenbrenner & Evans,
2000). Specifically, Bronfenbrenner placed greater emphasis
on proximal processes and called them "the engines of devel-
opment" (Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000, p. 118).
In two interrelated propositions he outlined the centrality of
proximal processes. First, Bronfenbrenner (1995a) argued that
. . . human development takes place through the processes of
progressively more complex reciprocal interaction between an
active, evolving biopsychological human organism and the
persons, objects, and symbols in its immediate external
environment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a
fairly regular basis over extended periods of time. Such enduring
forms of interaction in the immediate environment are referred
to as proximal processes. (p. 620)
In the developing child, an example of such enduring pat-
terns of proximal processes would be parent­child interac-
tions. Bronfenbrenner and Ceci (1994) suggested that
proximal processes (a) are the mechanisms through which
developmental potentials are actualized and (b) exert a more
powerful influence on developmental outcomes than contex-
tual factors.
In his second proposition, Bronfenbrenner (1995a) and
Bronfenbrenner and Evans (2000) posited that
the form, power, content, and direction of the proximal processes
affecting development vary systematically as a joint function of
the biopsychological characteristics of the developing person; of
the environment, both immediate and more remote, in which the
processes are taking place; and the nature of the developmental
outcomes under consideration. (p. 621)
Proposition 2 suggests that to understand the impact of prox-
imal processes on developmental outcomes, we have to focus
attention on the person, the context, and developmental out-
come under consideration.
Bronfenbrenner (1999) outlined the properties of proxi-
mal processes as follows:
(a) the individual must engage in an activity, (b) to be effective,
the activity must take place on a fairly regular basis over an
extended period of time, and become increasingly complex, and
(c) proximal processes are not limited to interpersonal
interactions; they can also involve interaction with objects and
symbols. (pp. 5-6)
What is evident from Bronfenbrenner's discussion is that
proximal processes can take on different shapes and form--
persons, objects, or activities--proximal processes have to
have regularity, and be free from interruptions to become
increasingly complex.
Bronfenbrenner (1995a) and Bronfenbrenner and Evans
(2000) argued that an adequate test of the bioecological
model requires a new form of research design that draws on
the two propositions relating to (a) the nature of proximal
processes and (b) how proximal processes interact with per-
son and context to influence particular developmental out-
comes. Such a research design Bronfenbrenner and Evans
(2000) termed the "process-person-context-time (PPCT)
model" (p. 621).
We acknowledge at the outset that given that our study
relies on secondary analyses of cross-sectional data, it placed
some constraints on our ability to implement all elements of
Bronfenbrenner's theory. Specifically, we were unable to
assess the time dimension of the theory. Consequently, we
employed what may be termed a limited version of the PPCT
research design. Specifically, we use a process-person-con-
text (PPC) design to examine in a multigroup structural
equation model (SEM) the associations among predictors of
children's positive and negative social behaviors.
Ashiabi and O'Neal 3
In using the PPC model (Figure 1), we examined whether
the associations among socioeconomic status (SES; macro-
system construct), neighborhood social capital, family and
parenting stress (microsystem factors), parent­child interac-
tions (proximal processes), and children's positive and nega-
tive social behaviors (developmental outcomes) differed
between male and female children (child characteristic).
Drawing on Bronfenbrenner's bioecological theory, we
hypothesize that (a) contextual influences (SES, a macrosys-
tem construct, and neighborhood and parenting factors,
microsystem constructs) will be mediated by proximal pro-
cesses (parent­child interactions), (b) proximal processes
will have a more powerful impact on children's developmen-
tal outcomes than contextual factors, and (c) the effect of
contextual and proximal processes will vary as a function of
child characteristic (child gender). Our choice of childhood
as a test of Bronfenbrenner's theory is driven by the fact that
younger children are heavily dependent on their parents,
thus, contextual and family factors are more likely to have a
greater influence on their developmental outcomes.
We now turn our attention to the examination of research
linking contextual factors and proximal processes to chil-
dren's developmental outcomes. We start by examining the
association among SES, family and parenting factors, and
child outcomes. We then assess the links between neighbor-
hood factors and child developmental outcomes. In examin-
ing the influence of contextual factors, we also discuss the
mediating role of proximal processes.
Contextual Influences and Child
Development
SES and Child Outcomes
There is a great body of evidence linking SES (a macrosys-
tem construct) to children's socioemotional competence,
although the association is not as strong (Barajas, Philipsen,
& Brooks-Gunn, 2008) and consistent as the link with cogni-
tive development (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). Studies of
children have found associations between SES and psycho-
logical well-being (Costello, Compton, Keeler, & Angold,
2003). Children in families with limited financial resources
compared with their more affluent peers are more likely to
experience a variety of socioemotional difficulties, such as
behavioral problems (Anthony, Anthony, Morrel, & Acosta,
2005), internalizing and externalizing symptoms (Duncan,
Brooks-Gunn, & Klebanov, 1994), problematic peer rela-
tions, and disruptive classroom behaviors (Patterson,
Kupersmidt, & Vaden, 1990).
SES and Family and Parenting Effects
Parents, a microsystem for their children, are also impacted
by socioeconomic circumstances. Parents from lower SES
backgrounds often experience higher levels of parenting
stress, psychological distress, and depression (Klebanov,

& Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, &
Mullan, 1981) than their higher SES counterparts. Pinquart
and Srensen (2000) identified four ways in which SES may
affect adult psychological well-being via (a) positive
appraisal of one's life; (b) improved quality of life; (c) low
material resources that contribute to economic strain and,
thus, psychological distress; and (d) the prevention of stress-
ors and increased coping abilities through the availability of
material and other resources.
Neighborhoods and Child Outcomes
Neighborhoods, a microsystem construct, are also linked
with children's developmental outcomes. The associations
between neighborhoods and children's behavioral and emo-
tional problems are less consistent than those reported for
cognitive and school outcomes (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn,
2000). However, the relationship remains even after control-
ling for family socioeconomic circumstances and parental
characteristics (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000; Sampson,
Morenoff, & Gannon-Rowley, 2002).
Children raised in poor neighborhoods are at an
increased risk for a number of negative outcomes includ-
ing internalizing and externalizing behavior problems
(Beyers, Bates, Pettit, & Dodge, 2003; Chase-Lansdale &
Gordon, 1996; Chase-Lansdale, Gordon, Brooks-Gunn, &
Klebanov, 1997), delinquency, mental health issues (Evans,
2004; Leventhal, Dupere, & Brooks-Gunn, 2009; Sampson
et al., 2002), conduct disorders (Aneshensel & Sucoff,
1996), and delays in their cognitive and social develop-
ment (Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998).
Although the level of neighborhood social capital, that is,
the resources inherent within community networks may
ameliorate some of these negative outcomes, the poorest
neighborhoods often have the fewest readily available
resources (Murray, Berkel, Gaylord-Hardon, Copeland-
Linder, & Nation, 2011; Rankin & Quane, 2002; Sampson,
Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997).
Neighborhoods and Parenting
Several studies (Chung & Steinberg, 2006; Dorsey &
Forehand, 2003; Rankin & Quane, 2002; Vieno, Nation,
Perkins, Pastore, & Santinello, 2010) have reported associa-
tions between aspects of neighborhood and parenting behav-
iors. For example, Chung and Steinberg (2006) in a study of
how neighborhood structural and social characteristics, par-
enting, and peers impacted adolescents'delinquency reported
that weak neighborhood social organization had on indirect
effect on delinquency via parenting behaviors and peers.
Similarly, Dorsey and Forehand (2003) in a study of how
social capital, neighborhood dangerousness, and positive
parenting relate to child psychosocial adjustment difficulties
reported that social capital related to child psychosocial
adjustment difficulties through positive parenting and neigh-
borhood dangerousness.
Processes and Child Development
What is clear from the research on SES, neighborhoods,
and child developmental outcomes is that, both SES and
neighborhood characteristics exert their effects on child
development via parenting and proximal processes, such
as, parent­child interactions and positive parenting behav-
iors. These views are in line with the family stress model
(Conger et al., 1992, 1993; Conger, Ge, Elder, Lorenz, &
Simons, 1994; McLoyd, Jayaratne, Ceballo, & Borquez,
1994). The family stress model suggests that SES impacts
children's outcomes via parental mental health and family
processes, and subsequently, adversely impacting parent-
ing behaviors (Evans, 2004; Knerr, Gardner, & Cluver,
2013), which in turn, have deleterious impacts on chil-
dren's well-being (Grant et al., 2003; Repetti, Taylor, &
Seeman, 2002).
Some research on neighborhood effects on child develop-
ment have found a meditational path via parental psycho-
logical distress, family processes, and parent­child
relationship constructs (Kohen, Leventhal, Dahinten, &
McIntosh, 2008; Kotchick, Dorsey, & Heller, 2005; Law &
Barber, 2007; White, Roosa, Weaver, & Nair, 2009). Kohen
et al. (2008) reported that lower neighborhood cohesion was
associated with maternal distress and family dysfunction,
which, in turn, were correlated to poor quality parenting
behaviors, and ultimately, poorer child outcomes.
The literature reviewed shows that macro- and microsys-
tem factors may affect children's development via proximal
processes. Specifically, both SES and neighborhood effects
operate by affecting parenting and family processes, parent-
ing practices, interactions between parents and their chil-
dren, and ultimately child outcomes. Furthermore, the review
shows that the constructs selected to test Bronfenbrenner's
theory and the associations among the constructs are well
grounded in the literature.
Method
Data Survey and Design
The data used were from the National Survey of Children's
Health (NSCH), 2007, a national cross-sectional telephone sur-
vey sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the
Health Resources and Services Administration (Child and
Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative [CAHMI], 2007).
The NSCH was intended to examine the physical and emotional
health of children aged 0 to 17 years, and the factors that may
relate children's well-being (Blumberg et al., 2007). The NSCH
used the sampling frame on the National Immunization Survey
(NIS), a large-scale random-digit-dialed (RDD) telephone
Ashiabi and O'Neal 5
survey designed to collect immunization history for children.
For a detailed description of NSCH's data survey and design see
Blumberg et al. (2007).
Data Collection and Sample
Computer-assisted telephone interviewing that started in
April 2007 to July 2008 resulted in 91,642 completed child-
level interviews. A letter was mailed prior to telephone calls.
Potential responders used this number to alert interviewers
that there were no children in their household, to ask ques-
tions about the study, or to complete an interview (Blumberg
et al., 2007). Consent for participation was obtained when it
was determined that a household contained an age-eligible
child. The respondent was the adult in the household who
was most knowledgeable about the sampled child's health
and health care. In a majority of households, the respondent
was the child's mother, father, or male/female guardian. For
the present study, data on 28,064 children aged 6 to 11 years
were used (Table 1).
Measures
Person characteristics
Gender of child. We used the gender of children to indicate
person characteristics because Bronfenbrenner (2005; Bron-
fenbrenner & Morris, 2006) argued that biological charac-
teristics of individuals can influence proximal processes and
determine their developmental outcomes.
Macrosystem. We conceptualized family SES as a macrosys-
tem construct because it (a) affects how the microsystemic
factors function (Bronfenbrenner, 1977a), and (b) describes
the economic conditions under which families live (Bronfen-
brenner, 1976), and includes among other variables, material
resources and opportunity structures (Bronfenbrenner, 1994).
Socioeconomic status.It was measured with three items:
anyone in the household employed at least 50 weeks (0 =
no, 1 = yes), income-poverty partitioned into eight levels
based on US Department of Health and Human Services
(USDHSS) guidelines (0 = at or below 100% of poverty to
8 = above 400% poverty level), and maternal education cat-
egorized into 3 levels (0 = less than high school to 3 = more
than high school).
Micro- and mesosystem links. We used two constructs (neigh-
borhood social capital and family and parenting stress) to
assess the effects of the microsystem, the most immediate
setting in which a child is situated (Bronfenbrenner, 1979,
1995a). Also, mesosystem effects--the relations between
two microsystems (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 1995a)--are
depicted by the association between neighborhood social
capital and family and parenting stress.
Neighborhood social capital.Four items were used as
indicators of this construct. The questions asked respon-
dents to indicate their level of agreement with the follow-
ing statements (people help each other out, we watch out
for each other's children, people I can count on, and adults
nearby I can trust) on a 4-point scale (1 = definitely agree
to 4 = definitely disagree). The items were reverse-coded
such that a higher score represents increased neighborhood
social capital
Family and parenting stress.This construct was assessed
with four observed indicators. Of these indicators, coping
with the demands was measured on a 4-point scale (1 = very
well to 4 = not very well at all); the other three indicators--
child much harder to care for, child does things that really
bother you, and how often felt angry with child--were mea-
sured on a 5-point scale (1 = never to 5 = always). Higher
scores on these indicators indicated higher levels of family
and parenting stress.
Proximal processes. Bronfenbrenner conceptualized proximal
processes as the driving forces of development (Bronfen-
brenner, 1999; Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000; Bronfen-
brenner & Morris, 2006). Examples of proximal processes
include playing with a child or reading activities, and the
relations between people and objects and symbols they come
into contact with (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 1998). In prior
research, proximal processes have been assessed by using
parents' disciplinary practices (Riggins-Caspers, Cadoret,
Knutson, & Langbehn, 2003) and educational interventions
and family functioning (Campbell, Pungello, & Miller-John-
son, 2002). We conceptualized proximal processes using a
proxy measure of parent­child interactions that assessed sen-
sitivity to the child's interest and affect, development of reci-
procity and regular routines, and active participation on the
part of parent (Rosenberg, Robinson, & Beck, 1986).
Parent­child interaction.Three items were loaded on this
factor: How well can you and your child share ideas or talk
about things that really matter (reverse-coded: 1 = not very
well at all to 4 = very well); in the past week, how many days
did all members of the family eat together (0-7); and, during
the past 12 months, how often did you attend events your
child participated in (1 = never to 4 = always). A higher score
indicates higher level of parent­child interaction.
Developmental outcomes
Positive social behaviors. This factor was made up of four
items that asked parents to report on a 5-point scale (1 = never
to 5 = always) the frequency with which children engaged in
the following behaviors: gets along with other children; tries
to understand other people's feelings; tries resolve conflicts
with classmates, family, or friends; and shows respect for
teachers and neighbors.
6 SAGE Open
Negative social behaviors. This construct was made up of
four items that asked parents to report on a 5-point scale
(1 = never to 5 = always) the frequency with which chil-
dren engaged in the following behaviors: argues too much,
bullies or is cruel or mean to others, disobedient, and stub-
born, sullen, or irritable. A higher score indicates that the
child engages in negative social behaviors with a higher
frequency.
Data Analytic Approach
A multigroup SEM was conducted using AMOS 6.0 program
(Arbuckle, 2005) with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation
procedures. The model incorporated the macrosystem (SES),
microsystem (neighborhood social capital and family and par-
enting stress), and proximal process (parent­child interactions)
constructs to examine gender differences in the associations

Generally, (Table 2) the indicators of SES were positively
correlated with the indicators of social capital, parent­child
interactions, and positive social behaviors, but were on the
other hand, mostly negatively associated with the indicators
of parenting and family stress and negative social behaviors.
Neighborhood social capital indicators were also mostly pos-
itively correlated with parent­child interactions and positive
social behaviors, and negatively with parenting and family
stress and negative social behaviors.
The variables used as indicators of parenting and family
stress were by and large positively associated with the indi-
cators of negative social behaviors, but negatively correlated
with the indicators of parent­child interactions and positive
social behaviors. The indicators of parent­child interactions
were mostly positively correlated with the indicators of posi-
tive social behaviors, but negatively associated with the indi-
ces of negative social behaviors. Finally, the indicators of
positive social behaviors were negatively correlated with
indices of negative social behaviors.
The Full Model
The goodness-of-fit for the unconstrained model, showed
that it had a good fit to the data, 2(392 df) = 9,100.15, p <
.001; Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .95, Root Mean Square
Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = .03, Test of close fit
(PCLOSE) = 1.00. This implies that the hypothesized casual
model of the associations among the constructs is tenable.
The unconstrained model (Figure 2) explained 74% and 54%
of the variation in positive social behavior for boys and girls,
respectively, and 73% and 70% of the variation in negative
social behavior for boys and girls, respectively.
To test for differences in slope between boys and girls, a
second model with equality constraints placed on all param-
eters was estimated. A chi-square test of difference between
the unconstrained and equality-constrained models, 2(30 df)
= 239.51, p < .001, suggests that some of the paths were
moderated by gender. To make interpretation of the results
easier to follow and consistent with the questions investi-
gated, we discuss the findings pertaining to each construct
sequentially. In reporting the findings, we use unstandard-
ized coefficients, because using standardized coefficients
could mask any significant differences that may exist
between the path coefficients boys and girls (Kline, 1998)
SES effects. The results showed that for boys and girls, living
in a higher SES family was positively correlated with neigh-
borhood social capital (boys = .49, girls = .48), and negatively
with family and parenting stress (boys = -.13, girls = -.12).
Furthermore, although children living in higher SES families
experienced increased parent­child interactions (boys = .13,
girls = .05), there was a significant difference in such interac-
tions (z = 3.66, p < .001); boys were more likely to benefit than
girls. In addition, there appears to be an attenuation effect in
the association between SES and both positive and negative
child behaviors. Specifically, for both genders, the observed
relation between SES and positive child behaviors in the
unconstrained model was negative (boys = -.16, girls = -.04),
a reversal of coefficients signs from the expected. Further
exploration (data available from the authors) revealed that
when only SES and neighborhood social capital are included
in a submodel, the association between SES and positive
social behaviors was in the expected direction (boys = .04,
girls = .03).
Finally, in terms of negative child behaviors, its correla-
tion with SES was reduced to nonsignificance in the uncon-
strained model (boys = -.03, girls = -.02). As before, a
submodel using only SES and neighborhood social capital as
predictors of negative social behaviors revealed a significant
association between SES and negative social behaviors for
both genders (boys = -.24, girls = -.17). These patterns of
findings suggest that family and parenting stress and parent­
child interaction factors may attenuate and mediate the
effects of SES on child outcomes.
Neighborhood social capital effects. Neighborhood social capi-
tal was negatively associated with family and parenting
stress (boys = -.15, girls = -.14), and positively with parent­
child interactions (boys = .08, girls = .06), with the associa-
tion being much stronger for boys than for girls (z = 2.29,
p = .01). As with the attenuation effects observed with SES,
there appears to be an attenuation effect regarding the asso-
ciation between neighborhood social capital and both posi-
tive and negative child behaviors. Specifically, for both
genders, the correlation observed between neighborhood
social capital and child positive behaviors in the uncon-
strained model was negative (boys = -.05, girls = -.01), a
finding inconsistent with expectations because of the rever-
sal of the regression coefficient signs. A submodel analysis
using only SES and neighborhood social capital as predictors
of child outcome showed the association between neighbor-
hood social capital and positive social behaviors to be posi-
tive (boys = .06, girls = .05). Also, neighborhood social
capital was positively associated with negative social behav-
iors for both genders (boys = .07, girls = .06), a finding
inconsistent with expectations. A submodel analysis as pre-
viously reported revealed a negative association between
neighborhood social capital and negative social behaviors
(boys = -.14, girls = -.12).
Family and parenting stress effects.Family and parenting
stress was negatively correlated with positive social behav-
iors (boys = -.05, girls = -.09) and parent­child interactions

(boys = -.33, girls = -.28). The observed negative associa-
tion with parent­child interaction was much stronger for
boys than for girls (z = -2.83, p = .002). Finally, family and
parenting stress was positively associated with negative
social behaviors (boys = .93, girls = .85), with the effect
being much stronger for boys than for girls (z = 1.96, p < 05).
Effects of parent­child interactions.Parent­child interactions
was positively linked with positive social behaviors (boys =
1.19, girls = .70) and negatively with negative social behav-
iors (boys = -.44, girls = -.53). The association with positive
social behaviors was much stronger for boys than for girls (z
= 4.81, p < 001), whereas the correlation with negative social
behaviors was much stronger for girls than for boys
(z = -2.20, p < 05).
The power of proximal processes. We examined the standard-
ized total effects to investigate our hypothesis that proximal
processes will have a more powerful effect on child positive
and negative social behaviors than contextual factors. For
negative social behaviors, we found family and parenting
stress (b = .85 for boys, b = .83 for girls) to have the most
powerful effect, with proximal processes (parent­child rela-
tions) being the second most powerful (b = -.18 for boys,
b = -.20 for girls). Conversely, in terms of positive social
behaviors, parent­child interactions had the most powerful
effect (b = .86 for boys, b = .62 for girls), whereas family and
parenting stress had the second most powerful effect
(b = -.63 for boys, b = -.55 for girls).
Discussion and Conclusion
The current study investigated a number of propositions
basedonBronfenbrenner'sbioecologicaltheory.Specifically,
we hypothesized that (a) contextual influences--SES, neigh-
borhood, and parenting factors--will be mediated by proxi-
mal processes--parent­child interactions, (b) proximal
processes will have a more powerful impact on children's

developmental outcomes than contextual factors, and (c) the
effect of contextual and proximal processes will vary as a
function of child characteristic. In general, we found support
for these hypotheses.
We discuss our findings by examining the associations
among the contextual constructs, proximal processes, and
developmental outcomes. In accordance with our hypothesis,
we found that the effects of SES (a macrosystem construct) on
child positive and negative social behaviors was mediated
through its association with neighborhood social capital and
family and parenting stress (microsystem factors), and parent­
child interactions (proximal processes). The meditational
hypothesis is also consistent with the family stress model's
(Conger et al., 1992; Conger et al., 1994; McLoyd et al., 1994)
view that SES is associated with children's outcomes via paren-
tal mental health and family processes, and subsequently,
adversely impacting parenting behaviors (Evans, 2004; Knerr
et al., 2013), and ultimately, children's outcomes. The fact that
part of the effect of SES on children's developmental outcomes
was mediated by its association with neighborhood social capi-
tal suggests that among parents, their experiences with social
relationships within neighborhoods can buffer economic con-
ditions by reducing parental stress and distress and improving
parenting (Cook, Shagle, & Degirmencioglu, 1997).
Also, consistent with Bronfenbrenner's views
(Bronfenbrenner, 1995a; Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000)
that child characteristics may interact with contextual fac-
tors, we found that the association between SES (a macro-
system construct) and parent­child relations (proximal
processes) was stronger for boys than for girls. The observed
differential relations may suggest that given that male chil-
dren are at an increased risk of engaging in negative social
behaviors (Griffin, Botvin, Scheier, Diaz, & Miller, 2000),
parents may intentionally increase their interactions with
their male children while they are younger to create bonds
that build bridges as children get older. With such bonds
between parents and their male children, the influence of
peers on negative social behaviors may be minimized.
The findings also revealed that the association between
SES and positive social behaviors may be attenuated;
whereas, the effects of SES on negative social behaviors was
found to be nonsignificant. Taken together, these results are
consistent with the view that although SES may be associ-
ated with children's socioemotional competence, the associ-
ation may not be as strong (Barajas et al., 2008; Bradley &
Corwyn, 2002). Specifically, it suggests that other factors
may partially or wholly explain the association between fam-
ily socioeconomic circumstances and child developmental
outcomes. It also highlights Bronfenbrenner's arguments
that contexts and processes that are closer to children, and in
which children actively participate have a more salient influ-
ence on their developmental outcomes (Bronfenbrenner &
Morris, 1998)
Furthermore, consistent with our hypothesis, the associa-
tions between neighborhood social capital and child positive
and negative behaviors appeared to be attenuated by family
and parenting stress and parent­child relations. The attenua-
tion effect may explain the view that the associations between
neighborhoods and children's behavioral and emotional
problems are less consistent than those reported for cognitive
and school outcomes (Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2000).
Specifically, the associations between neighborhood social
capital and child positive and negative behavior were medi-
ated by its links with both family and parenting stress and
parent­child interactions. The observed meditation is conso-
nant with reports that the effects of neighborhoods on child
socioemotional development are mediated by parental psy-
chological distress, family processes, and parenting behav-
iors (Kohen et al., 2008; Kotchick et al., 2005; White et al.,
2009).
The observed stronger association between neighborhood
social capital and parent­child relations (proximal processes)
for boys compared with girls may reflect differential parent-
ing behaviors toward boys and girls (Chaplin, Cole, & Zahn-
Waxler, 2005), and may buttress the aforementioned point
that parents increase their interactions with their male chil-
dren while they are younger to create bonds that build bridges
as they get older.
In line with our hypothesis and Bronfenbrenner's argu-
ment (Bronfenbrenner, 1995a; Bronfenbrenner & Ceci,
1994; Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000) that proximal pro-
cesses (parent­child interactions) will mediate the effect of
microsystem factors (family and parenting stress), we found
that the effect of family and parenting stress on positive and
negative child behavior was mediated by parent­child inter-
actions. Specifically, consistent with findings in the family
stress tradition (Conger et al., 1992, 1993; Conger et al.,
1994; McLoyd et al., 1994), we found that increased family
and parenting stress diminishes parent­child interactions,
which, in turn, affected child positive and negative social
behaviors.
Furthermore, consistent with Bronfenbrenner's (Bronfen
brenner,1995a;Bronfenbrenner&Ceci,1994;Bronfenbrenner
& Evans, 2000) argument that the context interacts with
child characteristics to influence developmental outcomes,
we found that higher levels of family and parenting stress
was more deleterious to boys' positive social behaviors than
it is for girls. That is to say, when family and parenting stress
increases, it has more of a negative effect on boys' positive
social behaviors than it does for girls. Simply put, increased
family and parenting stress put boys at risk for diminished
positive social behaviors. Furthermore, increased levels of
family and parenting stress had a greater impact on boys'
engagement in negative social behaviors than it did for girls.
Taken together, these findings suggest that family and par-
enting stress may be more detrimental for boys by adversely
affecting the quality of their interactions with parents, which,
in turn, increases their engagement in negative social behav-
iors. This finding may lend some credence to an earlier argu-
ment that the reason why SES and neighborhood social
Ashiabi and O'Neal 11
capital may be associated with a significant increase in inter-
actions between parents and their male children compared
with their female children may be the realization by parents
that decreasing interaction with sons increases the risk of
engagement in negative social behaviors and decreases the
probability of engaging in positive social behaviors.
In support of Bronfenbrenner's view (Bronfenbrenner,
1995a; Bronfenbrenner & Evans, 2000) that the impact of
proximal processes is a function of the person and develop-
mental outcome, the findings showed that association
between parent­child interactions (proximal process) and
child positive and negative social behaviors varied as a func-
tion of child characteristics (gender). Specifically, we found
that increased levels of parent­child interactions promoted
boys' positive social behaviors to a greater extent than girls'.
In addition, increased levels of parent­child interactions
were more beneficial to reducing girls' negative social
behaviors than that of boys. These findings are also conso-
nant with Bronfenbrenner's views (Bronfenbrenner, 1995a)
that the specific impact of proximal processes on develop-
mental outcomes may differ depending on the developmen-
tal outcome in question (Bronfenbrenner, 1995a, 2005).
In using the standardized total effects of each factor as
indicator of strength, we found partial support for our hypoth-
esis that proximal processes will have a stronger effect on
child outcomes than contextual factors. Specifically, we
found that depending on the developmental outcome, con-
textual factors­in this instance family and parenting stress--
were stronger in predicting negative social behaviors.
Alternatively, in terms of positive social behaviors, parent­
child interactions (proximal processes) was a stronger pre-
dictor. These findings could mean that (a) our measure of
parent­child interactions was not sensitive enough or (b)
depending on developmental outcome, contextual factors
may be more salient.
Limitations of the Study
Although the present study adds to the existing literature,
there are some limitations worth mentioning. First, given
that this was a secondary analysis of survey data, it has the
limitations encountered when using pre-existing data. For
example, the measure of parent­child interactions utilized in
the study may not capture many dimensions of the construct
of interest because of its restricted range. Second, the study
was cross-sectional, thus it cannot address the pathways
through which neighborhood and contextual factors affect
child positive and negative social behaviors. As such, the
fourth component of Bronfenbrenner's PPCT model, time,
cannot be addressed. Furthermore, although the hypothe-
sized model tested was supported, it is not exhaustive; equiv-
alent models with different paths and constructs than those
included in this study also could account for the variation
observed. Another limitation was that the data used represent
different age groups, thus limiting the generalizability of the
findings. Given these limitations, it would be useful to exam-
ine the model using a more diversified sample in a longitudi-
nal analysis study to Bronfenbrenner's hypotheses.
Conclusion
As Bronfenbrenner and Evans (2000) noted, the bioecologi-
cal model is not a theory about how human beings develop,
but rather, it aims to improve our understanding about the
conditions and processes that influence human development.
In that regard, we believe that this present enterprise has fur-
thered our knowledge about the contextual conditions and
processes that influence children's positive and negative
social development. An outline of the main conclusions of
our study is as follows: First, the effects of contextual fac-
tors--macro- and microsystem variables (SES, neighbor-
hood social capital, and family and parenting stress)--on
child social development were partially mediated by proxi-
mal processes (parent­child interactions). Second, as was
theorized by Bronfenbrenner, some of the effects of contex-
tual factors on child social development were modified
(moderated) by child gender. As well, the effects of proximal
processes on child positive and negative social behaviors dif-
fered significantly by child gender. Finally, we found partial
support for the hypothesis that proximal processes will have
a more powerful effect on development than the context in
which it occurs.
We conclude with the observation by Bronfenbrenner
(1995a) that he hoped his work "would impel others to seek
closure and yield scientific insights" (pp. 619-620). We also
hope that our undertaking will engage others to explore dif-
ferent domains and questions utilizing Bronfenbrenner's bio-
ecological theory.
