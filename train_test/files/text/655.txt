Employer-Based Health Insurance In A Changing Work Force
by Deborah Chollet
Abstract: The loss of manufacturing jobs and the expansion of service jobs and part-time employment
have contributed to a decline in the rate of employer-sponsored health insurance among workers. Not
only does manufacturing provide more of its own workers with coverage compared with other industry
groups, but it also is a significant net "exporter" of coverage to dependent workers in other industries.
In 1991 the net export of coverage represented a 20 percent tax on manufacturing employers per
covered worker, while professional services--the fastest-growing industry group--collected a subsidy
from other industry groups equal to more than 12 percent per covered worker. Similarly, larger
firms--those that employed 100 workers or more--paid a self-imposed tax of as much as 13 percent
per covered worker to support dependent workers employed in smaller firms.
Employer-sponsored health insurance plans are the single largest source
of private insurance coverage among nonelderly Americans. In 1991,
140 million Americans under age sixty-five--including nearly eighty-
nine million workers--had coverage from an employer-sponsored health
plan. Approximately three-quarters of employer-insured workers are covered
as a benefit of their own employment; all others--some twenty-one million
workers--are covered as the dependent of an employer-insured worker,
according to the March 1992 Current Population Survey.
The number of Americans covered by an employer health plan has
declined over the past decade. Historically, during periods of economic
recession the number and proportion of workers without employer coverage
has risen. However, at least since 1985 economic expansion has failed to
produce growth of employer-sponsored health insurance among workers
and their dependents. Between 1985 and 1991 the number of jobs that
provided health insurance declined by nearly 2 percent; 1.2 million fewer
workers were covered by their own employer in 1991 than had been
covered six years earlier. Since 1988 the loss of employer-insured jobs has
accelerated.
The erosion of coverage by employer-sponsored plans coincides with
major changes in the structure of the U.S. work force. The loss of manufac-
turing jobs characterized by relatively high rates of employer-sponsored

coverage and the expansion of service jobs and part-time employment have
contributed to the decline in coverage.
This DataWatch describes the economic burden of employer-sponsored
health insurance coverage assumed by employers and workers in different
industries and different-size firms. Estimates of uninsured workers and em-
ployer-insured workers are presented, as are estimates of the net change in
employer-insured jobs within major industry groups relative to the change
in industry employment. These estimates indicate that the growth of em-
ployer-insured jobs has been consistently slower than job growth in indus-
tries that have experienced net job growth. In industries with declining
employment, employer-insured jobs have declined even faster.
Uninsured And Employer-Insured Workers
It is well known that the percentage of workers who are uninsured varies
among industry groups and firm sizes. Uninsured workers are counted as the
difference between all workers in an industry or firm-size group and workers
who report having coverage from any of a number of sources: as a benefit of
the worker's own job; as the dependent of another worker; from an individ-
ual policy; or as a beneficiary of a public program, usually Medicaid. In 1991
just over half of all workers (55 percent) were covered directly by their own
employer; all other employer-insured workers were covered only by another
worker's plan. Nationally, for every ten workers insured by their own
employer, another three were covered only as dependents.
Variation by industry group. In 1991 the proportion of workers who
were uninsured from any source throughout the year (or for a significant
portion of the year) varied markedly among industry groups. Nearly 42
percent of agricultural workers reported having no insurance coverage
(Exhibit 1). Among workers principally employed in construction and
personal/entertainment services, nearly 30 percent were uninsured all year.
These very high rates of uninsured workers contrast with very low rates of
uninsured workers in other major industry groups, especially in government
(7 percent) and in finance, insurance, and real estate (8 percent).
In general, industries with low rates of uninsured workers have relatively
high rates of employer coverage, either sponsored by the workers' own
employers or received as dependents of workers at other firms. In no
industry is a low rate of employer coverage fully offset by coverage from
other sources, such as individually purchased insurance or public programs.
In firms that do not contribute to health coverage, coverage received by
workers as dependents of workers in other firms represents a real subsidy.
This subsidy is collected in the form of higher wages by the dependent
workers; by the firm as higher profit (perhaps supporting an otherwise

unprofitable enterprise); or by consumers as lower product prices.
The cost of coverage provided to dependent workers employed by an-
other firm represents a transfer among firms and industry groups--in effect,
a tax on firms that export coverage and a subsidy to firms that import
coverage for workers that they do not otherwise insure- In general, industry
groups with relatively high proportions of uninsured workers are also rela-
tively large importers of health insurance coverage--from other employers'
plans and from Medicaid (Exhibit 2).
Variation by size of firm. Differences in coverage also occur systemati-
cally among firms of different sizes, regardless of industry group. Among
wage and salary workers who identified firms with fewer than ten employees
as their principal job in 1991, 29 percent reported having no insurance
from any source throughout the year (Exhibit 3). This rate was systemati-
cally lower as firm size increased; in firms of 1,000 employees or more, only
9 percent of workers reported having no coverage from any source during
the year.

firms to have coverage sponsored by their own employer (regardless of
full-time job status) and less likely to have employer-based coverage only as
a dependent of another worker. Among workers in firms of a thousand or
more employees, just seventeen workers are covered only as a dependent for
every hundred workers covered by their own employer (Exhibit 3). In
contrast, for every hundred workers covered by their own employer in firms
with fewer than ten employees, another ninety-five are covered only as the
dependent of another worker.
Medicaid. Medicaid is a relatively small but growing source of coverage
among low-income workers in the United States, mainly as a result of
federal expansions of Medicaid eligibility effective since 1990 and expan-
sions in many states in excess of the federally required minimum. All states
must cover pregnant women and infants (to age one) with family incomes
below 133 percent of the federal poverty level States may extend eligibility
to pregnant women and infants up to 185 percent of poverty with full
federal matching, and many have done so. Some states have extended
Medicaid to these groups with income as high as 200 percent of poverty.
These provisions have resulted in a small but growing number of workers
and families who qualify for Medicaid. While only about 2 percent of
American workers reported receiving coverage from Medicaid during 1991,
in some industry groups--agriculture, retail trade, business and repair serv-
ices, and personal and entertainment services--reliance on Medicaid as an
exclusive source of health coverage ranged between 4 percent and 6 percent
of total industry employment. Similarly, reliance on Medicaid by workers
employed in small firms (4 percent) is greater than that among workers in
large firms (2 percent). However, nearly 29 percent of Medicaid-insured
workers identified firms with 1,000 employees or more as their principal
employer; only 20 percent identified firms with fewer than ten employees
(Exhibit 4). As defined here, these workers reported no coverage from an
employer (either from their own employer or as a dependent) that year.
Growth And Loss Of Employer-Insured Jobs
Since 1985 U.S. net employment has grown 7.4 percent. This includes
rapid growth in some industries (professional services, personal/entertain-
ment services, and self-employment) and declining employment in others
(manufacturing and mining). As employment has changed among industry
groups, so has the proportion of workers covered by their own employer
(Exhibit 5).
Several aspects of the relative change in employer-covered workers ver-
sus the change in industry employment since 1985 are significant. First,
industries that have grown most rapidly since 1985 also have gained em-

ployer-insured jobs. However, in each of the fast-growing industries, em-
ployment growth has substantially exceeded the growth of employer-
insured jobs. For example, for every hundred jobs gained in professional
services (the highest-growth industry), only forty included coverage (Ex-
hibit 5). As a result, while the number of own-employer-insured workers in
high-growth industries has risen, the percentage of workers in the industry
with coverage from their own employer has declined.
Second, while own-employer coverage has trailed employment growth in
all industries, the erosion of coverage has been particularly pronounced in
slow-growth industries. In very-low-growth industries--construction and
agriculture--the decline in employer-insured jobs has been dramatic, with
losses of 270 to 344 employer-insured jobs per 100 new jobs gained overall.
Finally, in both manufacturing and mining--industry groups that histori-
cally have had among the highest rates of employer-insured workers--the
rate of loss of employer-insured jobs has exceeded the rate of decline in total
employment (Exhibit 6). For every 100 manufacturing jobs that have been
lost since 1985, 224 employer-insured manufacturing jobs have been lost
(see Exhibit 5).
These changes in the number and rate of employer-insured jobs across
sectors suggest that further employment growth is unlikely to stem the
dwindling rate of employer-based coverage. Furthermore, the rapid decline
of insured jobs in major sectors of the economy may be problematic for
other industries. Both mining and manufacturing are relatively small im-
porters of coverage from other industries. To the degree that they are also
exporters of health coverage to dependent workers in other industries, the

faster loss of insured jobs in mining and manufacturing withdraws a real
subsidy from other industries and contributes to an ongoing decline in
employer-based coverage relative to employment in all sectors.
Effects Of Changes In Employer-Insured Jobs Across Sectors
Changes in the structure of employment and primary employer coverage
may exert a secondary effect across sectors by changing available sources of
insurance coverage for workers whose only coverage is received as a de-
pendent of another worker. In particular, declining own-employer coverage
in industries that export coverage suggests loss of dependents' coverage and,
therefore, growing noncoverage in other industry groups as well
The distribution of health insurance exported to dependent workers in
other industry groups (Exhibit 7) is significant in several ways. First, indus-
try groups that have gained employment the fastest since 1985 are also
among the strongest net importers of dependent coverage from other indus-

try groups, both absolutely and relative to own-industry employment. In
1991 the professional services industry "imported" coverage for 1.2 million
workers net of its export of coverage to workers in other industry groups.
Second, the two industry groups that absolutely lost employer-insured
jobs between 1985 and 1991--manufacturing and mining--are major ex-
porters of insurance coverage to workers in other industries. In 1991 manu-
facturing exported coverage to 3.2 million dependent workers in other
industries net of imported coverage; these dependent workers were not
otherwise covered by an employer plan of their own. On average, for every
hundred manufacturing jobs that are lost, a net fifteen workers in other
industry groups also lose employer-sponsored coverage. Thus, the net loss of
more than one million manufacturing jobs since 1985 has produced an
estimated net loss of dependent workers' coverage for at least 157,000
workers employed in other industries. The slow growth of employer-insured
jobs in import industries, moreover, has failed to offset the interindustry loss
of dependent workers' coverage.
Finally, within industry groups, large firms are the greatest net exporters

of dependent workers' coverage both absolutely and as a proportion of
large-firm workers (Exhibit 8). In 1991 firms with 1,000 employees or more
exported coverage to 4.3 million dependent workers in firms of other sizes,
net of imported coverage. For every hundred large-firm workers in 1991,
nearly ten workers in smaller firms were covered as dependents.
Similar to the net loss of exported coverage associated with the loss of
employer-insured jobs in some industries, the downsizing of large U.S. firms
apparently has also contributed to the erosion of coverage among workers
and dependents since 1985. Further growth in small firms is unlikely to
produce offsetting increases in coverage for workers and their families,
absent government action requiring significant employer contributions to
coverage. In 1991 small firms--and particularly those with fewer than
twenty-five workers--were strong net importers of insurance coverage.
Export Of Health Insurance Benefits As Taxation Across Sectors

workers and their employers in firms that do not provide benefits (Exhibit
9). Net tax subsidy rates are calculated in each sector as the number of
workers in another sector that employers cover as dependents, net of
imported coverage, per the number of workers covered within the sector as
the primary beneficiary. Obviously, sectors with both a high rate of covered
workers and a high self-imposed net tax bear the largest total burden to
support dependent workers employed in other sectors.
Among the industry groups, the highest rates of effective taxation on
health insurance benefits offered to workers occur in mining (35 percent)
and manufacturing (20 percent), as well as in transportation, communica-
tions, and public utilities (23 percent). In addition, these industry groups
have relatively high rates of covered workers, resulting in a disproportion-
ate cost burden for them. Compared with all other industry groups, mining
and manufacturing also have shown absolute loss of employment as well as
the fastest loss of insured jobs. Conversely, the greatest rates of subsidy are
being collected by firms and workers in personal and entertainment services
(72 percent) and by self-employed workers (141 percent)--both fast-grow-
ing sectors--as well as in retail trade (35 percent).
The magnitude of self-imposed taxation to support dependent workers
also is positively related to firm size. In 1991 all firms with 100 employees or

more paid a significant, self-imposed net tax per covered worker to support
coverage of dependent workers in smaller firms (Exhibit 9). This tax varied
from 4.5 percent among firms that employed 100 to 499 workers to nearly
13 percent among firms that employed 1,000 workers or more. Conversely,
firms with fewer than 100 employees received an average net subsidy of 3.4
percent to 50 percent per covered worker in 1991 in the form of depend-
ents' coverage provided to their workers by larger firms.
These taxes and subsidies across sectors are likely to affect the number of
jobs that offer coverage as well as job growth within sectors. That is, the
additional cost imposed on insured mining and manufacturing jobs, as well
as on insured jobs in large firms (sectors that have taxed themselves heavily
to support dependent workers in other industries) discourages the offering

of benefits in those industries and may contribute to total job loss as well
Conversely, high rates of subsidy encourage employment in some sec-
tors--especially professional services and self-employment, as well as retail
trade. In addition, the availability of these subsidies to some employers
probably deters other employers from providing health benefits to their
workers. That is, in industries that import substantial amounts of coverage,
firms that do not receive subsidies are best able to compete with firms that
are subsidized only if they, too, do not offer coverage to their workers.
Competition does not allow employers in such an industry to consider
whether their workers are covered at all.
Concluding Remarks
The erosion of employer-sponsored health insurance among American
workers and their families is significant. The loss of employer-insured jobs
in one sector affects coverage in others as dependents' coverage also is lost.
Major industry groups and small and large firms are strongly interdepend-
ent, in terms of the dependents' coverage imported from and exported to
other sectors. It is notable that the industry groups that have actually lost
jobs since 1985, and at an even faster pace have lost employer-insured jobs,
are among the strongest net exporters of dependent coverage to other
industry groups. Conversely, the rate of dependents' coverage imported by
high-growth industries suggests that their growth has been encouraged by
the real subsidies provided to their workers in the form of such coverage.
These patterns offer little to support the belief that erosion of employer-
based coverage will reverse itself. The extraordinary growth of health care
costs--persistently and by wide margins exceeding the growth of prices and
wages in all other sectors--implies an increasing burden on businesses that
provide health insurance benefits to their workers. As the subsidies pro-
vided to other-industry workers in the form of dependents' coverage also
become more burdensome, the propensity to offer family coverage or any
coverage at all to one's own workers declines.
Aggressive government action to curb the growth of health care costs
may stem the further erosion of employer-based coverage among workers
and their families. However, it is unclear whether that action alone would
be sufficient to reverse the loss of insured jobs that is being driven by
competition. Nevertheless, failure to act seems virtually certain to encour-
age continued loss of employer-based coverage among American workers,
as well as the loss of total employment in sectors that tax themselves to
support coverage of dependent workers employed eslewhere.
