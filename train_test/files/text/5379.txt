Abstract. Eye movements are strongly influenced by the task given to an observer. The immediacy
of such eye movements, which are difficult to control consciously, offers the potential to explore
highly variable subjective evaluations, such as aesthetic preference, with reliable objective measures.
We presented a variety of images in sets of 2, 4, or 8 items for different durations and analyzed
oculomotor statistics such as cumulative fixation duration, refixations, and the sequence of fixations
while participants searched for their preferred image, after which participants indicated their preference
using a button press. The total amount of time spent looking at any image correlates with selection
preference and does so increasingly well with longer presentation duration. For short presentations,
the first and last fixations correlate better with image preference. All response measures become
increasingly variable as the number and complexity of presented images are increased. A weighted
combination of these measures can significantly improve the correlation with preference, suggesting
a "signature" which could be used as a reliable indicator for task-free subjective evaluation of stimuli
in visual psychophysics. Its role as an improved fitness function in visually driven evolutionary
algorithms is discussed.
Keywords: aesthetics, visual perception, attention, eye movements, eye tracking, top-down, bottom-up.
1Introduction
The empirical study of the aesthetic experience is not easy. Fechner (1865, as cited in Berlyne, 1971)
was well aware of this when he first established the field of experimental aesthetics and observed that
"aesthetic phenomena are among the most complex phenomena within the domain of
psychology, and this is often used as an excuse by psychologists for being able to say so little
about them".
This difficulty stems, in part, from a wide range of definitions of what constitutes, or contributes
to, the aesthetic experience (Arnheim, 1974; Berlyne, 1971; Hassenzahl, 2008) as well as the range
and complexity of the stimuli, including paintings and sculpture, architecture, musical compositions
and performances, film and dance, which can be evaluated aesthetically. These challenges frequently
result in a reductionist approach, which allows more precise questions about the relationship between
some feature of the stimulus and the consciously articulated preferences to be explored in a highly
controlled manner. However, as observed by Arnheim (1974), the aesthetic experience is rather fragile
and typically relates to the gestalt, or whole, rather than the sum of any isolated parts meaning that
a reductionist approach will never be able to explain the effects of the complex interaction of many
individual features on the aesthetic evaluation of the stimulus. Previously, we have shown (Holmes &
Zanker, 2008) that evolutionary algorithms (Bentley, 1999; Goldberg, 1989; Holland, 1975), which
provide a robust method for searching complex feature spaces for highly fit interactions, can be used to
answer questions relating to aesthetic preference, using the time spent fixating each image in a simulta-
neously presented array as a measure of fitness. In this paper, we identify a more powerful oculomotor

signature which correlates with selections based on visual aesthetic preference using a wide range of
photographic stimuli, with a view to integrating this signature as a fitness measure in the gaze-driven
evolutionary algorithm (Holmes & Zanker, 2008) to facilitate the aesthetic evaluation of complex
visual stimuli without the need for conscious articulation of that preference.
The association between the task being performed and the eye movements made while performing
the task is well established. In picture viewing (Buswell, 1935; Yarbus, 1967), music and word read-
ing (Land & Furneaux, 1997; Rayner, 1998), visual search (Connor, Egeth, & Yantis, 2004), complex
real-world scene perception (Henderson, 2004), and motor tasks (Land, 2007), consistent patterns of
eye movements have been detected across participants which point to the crucial role that the task
plays in the direction of overt attention. Free viewing tasks, where the participant is not given any task
to perform but is merely encouraged to explore the visual scene, are typically used to highlight the
influence of low-level, or bottom-up, influences on eye movements stemming from the visual scene
itself. However, such effects are not stable over time (Tatler, Baddeley, & Gilchrist, 2005), suggesting
the presence of some internally motivated, top-down tasks generated by the participant. It has been
suggested that humans seek to create a stimulating and pleasing visual environment for themselves
(Berlyne, 1971) and that such behavior might be biologically conditioned as a result of the positive sen-
sations that such stimuli provide (Biederman & Vessel, 2006). If that is indeed the case, then the pattern
of eye movements made while performing an aesthetic evaluation task might allow preferences to be
predicted under free viewing conditions, allowing aesthetic preferences to be explored experimentally
without the many problems associated with conscious reporting of subjective preferences (Nisbett &
Wilson, 1977).
Artworks have long been used to elicit eye movements for scientific study, whether for the purposes
of exploring task demand effects (Yarbus, 1967) or for providing an insight into the relationship be-
tween artistic images and the viewer's aesthetic response to it (Buswell, 1935; Locher, Krupinski, Mello-
Thoms, & Nodine, 2007; Stratton, 1906; Tatler, Wade, & Kaulard, 2007; Wooding, Mugglestone, Purdy,
& Gale, 2002). Most attempts to relate eye movements to the aesthetic qualities of the stimulus have
concentrated on the looking behavior of participants while viewing paintings one at a time (Buswell,
1935; Henderson & Hollingworth, 1998; Rayner & Pollatsek, 1992; Wooding, 2002) and have shown a
degree of consistency between viewers with respect to the number and duration of fixations in regions
of the artwork which are highly detailed and thus potentially more informative. Attempts to correlate
such fixational measures with respect to the outcome of a relative evaluation of several stimuli presented
simultaneously are less common, perhaps due to the large individual differences in aesthetic preference
(Arnheim, 1974; Berlyne, 1971), but this does not preclude a potential consistency in the oculomotor be-
havior during the collection of visual information about the stimuli prior to the decision being made, and
there is evidence to support a tendency for gaze to linger on objects or artistic images we prefer (Pieters
& Warlop, 1999; Plumhoff & Schirillo, 2009; Santella & DeCarlo, 2004).
Preferential selection based on eye movements is not new and is central to the preferential looking
paradigm (Dobson, 1983; Teller, 1979) and further supported by the gaze cascade model of preference
decision making (Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Shimojo, Simion, Shimojo, & Scheier, 2003). Funda-
mental to both of these is the relationship between accumulated fixation time and task relevance first
identified by Yarbus (1967). Supporting empirical studies are traditionally performed with just two
concurrently presented stimuli, with preference being attributed to a stimulus if it attracts the gaze
above chance, that is, more than 50% of the presentation time. In other words, the preferential look-
ing paradigm utilizes a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) method of selection which reduces the
noise in the decision making by controlling the cognitive load on the participant and the differences
between the images in the binary choice (Houston-Price & Nakai, 2004). However, this inevitably
constrains the variability between stimuli to one or two features (i.e., stimulus dimensions) and means
that an exploration of interactions among multiple stimulus features results in a large number of trials,
introducing the risk of additional noise arising from participant fatigue.
Most models of overt visual search involving multifeatured stimuli, suggest two phases; the first
being associated with scanning the visual field for relevant locations and the second being associ-
ated with the more detailed identification, comparison, and evaluation of these image regions (Locher
et al., 2007; Van der Lans, Pieters, & Wedel, 2008; Velichkovsky, Joos, Helmert, & Pannasch, 2005).
This first phase has been shown to be highly susceptible to the distribution of low-level image features
over the visual field (saliency; Itti & Koch, 2000) and is characterized by frequent, short fixations
(Antes, 1974; Glaholt & Reingold, 2009). The second phase introduces top-down effects, for exam-

ple, driven by the task being performed, the emotional content of the image, or personal preferences
(Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Land, 2007; Locher et al., 2007) and results in fewer but longer fixations
(Antes, 1974; Glaholt & Reingold, 2009). Over a prolonged viewing period, the two operation modes
are likely to alternate repeatedly and interact, because participants look for what they like but their
preferences can also be influenced by what they see (Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Shimojo et al., 2003).
This would suggest that the time course of the eye movements, over and above the cumulative fixation
time used in the preferential looking paradigm, is likely to provide substantial information, which re-
lates to the participant's decision making. A variety of oculomotor measures, other than fixation time,
are available from an eye tracker, which have, to varying degrees, been correlated with viewing strate-
gies during visual search, single image viewing, and decision making. These include number, spatial,
and temporal distribution of fixations (Carbon et al., 2006; Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Land, 2007;
Pannasch, Helmert, Roth, Herbold, & Walter, 2008; Shimojo et al., 2008; Wooding, 2002) and saccade
size (amplitude) which has been show to have an inverse correlation with fixation duration during
the later (top-down initiated) phase while viewing artworks (Pannasch et al., 2008). This paper will
focus on the spatiotemporal distribution of gaze positions and their associated durations, which should
already contain implicit information that also could be derived from analysis of saccade amplitudes.
To test whether the oculomotor measures generalize across aesthetic preference tasks, it is im-
portant that a range of images is evaluated, and four different categories were used in the current
experiment. Common small objects and buildings are known to have distinct representations in the
human brain with differing typical locations in the visual field--small objects are typically located
in the fovea, while buildings are more frequently seen in the peripheral visual field (Aguirre, Zarahn,
& D'Esposito, 1998; Levy, Hasson, Avidan, Hendler, & Malach, 2001). These two stimulus types
are used along with familiar packages of commercial products, which represent an everyday exam-
ple of preference-based visual search in visually cluttered environments such as supermarket shelves
(Van der Lans et al., 2008). We have shown previously that simple images such as monochromatic
rectangles with varying height to width ratio and colored shapes can be evolved using an evolutionary
algorithm in which the fitness of each image is based on the cumulative fixation duration (Holmes &
Zanker, 2008). To link to such work on basic figures, a fourth category of simple colored geometric
shapes is included in the present study to further validate the generality of the experimental findings.
Within each main category, images representing four different types of stimuli (subcategories) are used
to control for any effects unique to a semantically associated type of image or to a particular class of
features. In addition to manipulating the image type, the display size and presentation duration are var-
ied in our experiments, with the intention of determining an optimal signal to noise ratio for sampling
aesthetic preference with a view to providing sufficient competition between images without fatiguing
the participant. This is particularly important if the signature is to be incorporated in an evolutionary
algorithm where competition for a limited resource, such as the attention of the participant, is vital to
establish relative preference, or fitness scores, for the images being presented in an iterative process.
2 General Methods
2.1Participants
Seven participants with normal, or corrected-to-normal, vision were recruited from the Psychology
department at Royal Holloway, University of London. The project was approved by the institutional
ethics committee.
2.2Stimuli
Samples of two, four, and eight images from one of four categories, each comprising four subcate-
gories (see Figure 1), were displayed using a Cambridge Research Systems ViSaGe (Visual Stimulus
Generator). Luminance was not normalized across the images, as we were interested in identifying
oculomotor signature that would work despite uncontrolled luminance. Background luminance (white)
was 86.3 cd/m2. Stimuli were displayed on a 48-cm diameter cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor at a dis-
tance of 57 cm from the participant. The physical size of an image on screen ranged from 20 mm 3 30
mm to 50 mm 3 40 mm. Random sampling without replacement from a set of eight images for each
subcategory ensured that no image was displayed more than once in each screen presentation, but the
same image could be displayed in more than one trial (in case of eight displayed images, the full set
was presented in each trial). This was intended to introduce contextual effects because the aesthetic
evaluation of each image is relative to the other individuals presented (Shen, Elahipanah, & Reingold,
429 Holmes T, Zanker JM
2007). Individuals were displayed in a radial fashion (see Figure 2) with their center at 8Â° from a
central fixation cross-hair presented immediately prior to the stimuli, that is, the stimuli were presented
peripherally with respect to the fixated location at the start of each screen presentation.
Participants were presented with samples of images and instructed to look for the image they most
preferred. The following variables were manipulated:
Display size: Two, four, or eight images randomly placed at the cardinal/ordinal locations.
Examples of the locations of two, four, or eight image presentations are shown in Figure 2.
Presentation duration: The images were displayed for 1,500, 2,500, or 5,000 ms before being
obliterated by a number indicating the button to be pressed to select the image.
Image category: The images in a single screen presentation were taken from a single subcategory
of the following categories: objects, buildings, commercial products, or shapes.
Image subcategory: Each of the four image categories comprised four semantically related
subcategories, for example, the shape category featured differently colored circles, squares,
triangles, and pentagons. The full list of subcategories is given in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Complete image set for Experiments 1 and 2. All eight images for each category and subcategory
are shown in one of their 8AFC presentations. Reading top-down and left to right: objects (scissors, cameras,
watches, mobile phones); buildings (houses, churches, schools, shops); product packages (Bio powder, color
powder, bio tablets, color tablets); shapes (circles, triangles, squares, pentagons). Random samples from the set
of images formed 2AFC and 4AFC presentations. The spatial position of each image was randomly selected for
each trial, so, for example, the red square could appear in any of the 2/4/8 locations for presentations from the
squares subcategory.

Each subcategory comprised eight distinct images taken from Google Image searches on the cat-
egory names that were converted to a 256-color bitmap and resized for presentation. The full image
set is shown in the 8AFC configuration in Figure 1.
2.3Timing
After a central fixation cross-hair was displayed for 1,000 ms, participants were presented with a
screen of two, four, or eight images for evaluation for 1,500, 2,500, or 5,000 ms. After this period,
numbers corresponding to buttons on a keypad were displayed at the stimulus locations, obliterating
a large part of each image; this was to ensure that enough of the image was visible so that participants
did not need to spend time encoding the spatial location of their preferred image during the image
presentation stage but were unable to continue evaluating the images after the image presentation time.
Participants then indicated their preferred image by pressing the number corresponding to the image
(see Figure 2) on a physical keypad. No time limit was imposed on the manual response, but partici-
pants were encouraged to do this as quickly as possible. On making their selection, a color noise mask
was presented for 250 ms to eradicate after images, before the next trial began.
2.4 Eye tracking
A Cambridge Research Systems 50-Hz Video Eye-Tracker (CRS VET) was used to sample raw x and
y coordinates for gaze location every 20 ms. Fixations were defined as distinct periods of 100 ms or
more with gaze location remaining within a 2.5-mm window on the screen, that is, 0.25Â° of visual an-
gle at a viewing distance of 57 cm. Areas of interest extending 5 mm beyond the edges of each image
were used, which corresponds with the 0.5Â° spatial resolution of the eye tracker. Oculomotor measures
were calculated as follows:
Duration was calculated by simply summing the duration of all fixations for each image.
The sequence of first fixations was recorded on the basis of the first fixation on an image
location, for example, in the 4AFC condition, a first fixation sequence of (Images 1, 3, or 4)
would indicate that Image 1 was fixated first, then Image 3 followed by Image 4, with possible
off-target fixations and refixations of Image 1 prior to the first fixation of Image 3, possible off-
target fixations and refixations of Images 1 and 3 prior to the first fixation of Image 4 and Image
2 never being fixated.

numbers shown in each configuration correspond to the button on the numeric keypad used to identify preference
for the image at that location.

Last fixation was recorded as simply the last location fixated prior to images being obliterated
by the manual selection numbers.
Returns were defined as distinct refixations, that is, they were separated by at least one fixation
of a different image or empty space.
2.5 Experiment 1
Experiment 1 evaluated the effects that array size and presentation length have on the predictive poten-
tial of the oculomotor measures. It comprised two stimulus presentations for each of the four catego-
ries (random selection of subcategory), for presentation durations of 1,500, 2,500, and 5,000 ms and
display sizes of two, four, and eight, that is, 72 trials, for each of the seven participants. All conditions
were randomly interleaved, meaning that the participant was unaware of how much time they had to
locate their preferred image.
3Results
Each of the oculomotor measures (duration, first fixation, last fixation, returns) was examined for its
correlation with the manually chosen image, that is, the number of times the longest fixation, first
fixation, last fixation, and most frequently returned to location matched the manually chosen preferred
location was calculated for each participant, for each of the display sizes. If a measure is uncorrelated,
then the number of matches should be at chance level (i.e., 50% in the 2AFC condition, 25% in the
4AFC condition, 12.5% in the 8AFC condition), meaning that the ratio of matches to chance (propor-
tion of correct matches/chance level for the presentation size) should be 1, with results higher than 1
indicating a positive correlation and results less than 1 indicating a negative correlation. The results
for the ratios of correct matches to chance across the 3 display conditions and 3 presentation durations
are shown in Figure 3.
The results of two-tailed repeated measures ANOVAs, corrected using Bonferroni, for each of the
oculomotor measures showed a significant main effect from the number of images presented: fixation
duration, F(2, 12) = 11.367, p < .005; first fixation, F(2, 12) = 9.270, p < .01; last fixation, F(2, 12) =
13.095, p < .005; returns, F(2, 12) = 36.619, p < .001. Two-tailed post hoc comparisons between the
three AFC levels identified significant differences between presentation of two and four images for
fixation duration (p < .05), presentation of two and eight images for last fixation (p < .05) and returns
(p < .01), and presentation of four and eight images for last fixation (p < .05) and returns (p < .005). The
results of two-tailed repeated measures ANOVAs, corrected using Bonferroni, for each of the oculomo-
tor measures showed only a marginal main effect from the presentation duration on fixation duration,
F(2, 12) = 4.913, p = .056, with no significant effect on any of the other measures (p > .05). Similarly,
the interaction between number of images and presentation duration was only significant for fixation
duration, F(4, 24) = 4.284, p < .05. Post hoc analysis of this interaction for fixation duration revealed
a significant effect from presentation in the 8AFC condition, F(2, 12) = 5.825, p < .05, and from the
presentation size in the 1,500 ms, F(2, 12) = 5.427, p < .05, and 5,000 ms, F(2, 12) = 19.906, p < .001,
conditions.
The results for the returns measure show performance below chance in both the 2AFC and 4AFC
conditions. This is largely because returns were very scarce in those trials, suggesting that participants
either did not have enough time to complete first fixations on all the stimuli, as would certainly be
the case in the 1,500-ms presentation for eight images, or were able to maintain representations of up
to four locations in working memory from initial scanning of the images prior to any prolonged fixa-
tion based on preference. Overall, the results clearly show an increased performance above chance
on all measures when the participant is presented with more choice, that is, the oculomotor statistics
are more informative when there are more candidates to be evaluated, with little or no effect from
extended presentation time, especially for the single fixation measures.
3.1 Experiment 2
The second experiment evaluated the effects that image category and presentation length have on the
predictive potential of the oculomotor measures. It comprised four stimulus presentations with a fixed
display size of 8 for each of the 16 subcategories, for presentation durations of 1,500, 2,500, and 5,000
ms each, that is, 192 trials for each of the three participants, selected from the initial seven. This meant
that the participants saw images from Experiment 1 supplemented by images they had never seen be-
Using an oculomotor signature as an indicator of aesthetic preference 432
fore. Randomization of the location of the images meant that participants were highly unlikely to see
the same arrangement viewed in the 8AFC condition in the first experiment. As before, all conditions
were randomly interleaved, meaning that the participant was unaware of how much time they had to
locate their preferred image.
4Results
Figure 4 shows little difference in the overall performance of the four oculomotor measures for the
four categories, with all performing better than chance. The results of two-tailed repeated measures
ANOVAs, corrected using Bonferroni, for each of the oculomotor measures showed only a significant
main effect from the category for first fixation (F(3, 6) = 11.271, p < .05). There was a significant
main effect from the presentation duration for the returns measure (F(2, 4) = 17.777, p < .05), and a
significant main effect from the interaction of category and duration for first fixation (F(6, 12) = 4.723,
p < .05). No significant effect was observed between subcategories of image type for any of the four
major categories.
These results are similar to those for the 8AFC condition in the Experiment 1 and suggest that the
image type had little effect on the measures. The strong performance of the first fixation measure in
the 1,500-ms shape is probably a result of the simplicity of the eight images being used in each of the
trials allowing an almost reflexive saccade to be made to the preferred color in later trials. The consist-
ent improvement in the performance of the returns measure for longer presentation times across all
image types confirms the importance of this behavior when making comparative preference choices
and suggests that in the absence of prior knowledge of the image characteristics, this might be the best
single indicator of preference.
Figure 3. Ratio of number of times the four oculomotor measure corresponds with the subsequent manual AFC
selection, relative to chance levels: (a) fixation duration; (b) first fixation; (c) last fixation; (d) returns. Consistent
improvements are visible across measures with increased number of images, with no consistent effect from
presentation duration. Results are averaged over 24 trials for each condition, N 5 7. Bars show standard error.

4.1 Oculomotor signature
The results from Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that predictive potential of each of the oculomotor meas-
ures depends on the size of the stimulus sample and duration of presentation while only being mildly
affected by the image category and, in this case, associated image complexity. Figure 5 shows an
example of the cumulative fixation plot for a single participant (P4) in a single trial (5,000 ms, 8AFC,
buildings category). From this plot, it can be seen that neither the first image fixated nor the image be-
ing fixated at the end of the trial was identified as the preferred image by the viewer, highlighting the
problem with single fixation measures, as the first fixation is made without information about the other
choices available, and the final fixation might be made after a decision has been made.
The number of times first fixation matches the selected preference, expressed as a percentage of
all trials in which at least one image was accurately fixated (396 of the 6 3 72 = 432 trials reported in
Experiment 1), is shown in Figure 6 for all items presented. Here, it can clearly be seen that the first
item fixated is less likely to reflect the final selection as both presentation duration and presentation
size increases and although always above chance for the display size, as choice and presentation time
increase, late fixated items are increasingly likely to correlate with the manual preference selection.
However, this presents a problem for a cumulative duration-based fitness evaluation, as the later an
item is first fixated, the less chance it has to accumulate a long fixation duration. This suggests the need
to weight the fixation duration according to the lateness of the first fixation for each item.
On the basis of these observations and the group results for Experiments 1 and 2, a new oculomo-
tor measure, or "signature," was calculated using a multiplicative weighting which effectively scales
the cumulative fixation duration, according to the likelihood that this image will be the preferred
image, using the sequence of first fixations and the number of returns (distinct refixations after first
fixation) to the image, as follows:
Figure 4. Ratio of number of times the four oculomotor measure corresponds with the subsequent manual AFC
selection, relative to chance levels: (a) fixation duration; (b) first fixation; (c) last fixation; (d) returns. Results
are averaged by image category (object, building, package, or shape) over 16 trials for each category and each
presentation duration (192 trials in total), N 5 3. Bars show standard error.

measures showed significant improvements at 1,500 ms for fixation duration, t(2) = 4.200, p < .05, and
returns, t(2) = 3.560, p < .05; at 2,500 ms for fixation duration, t(2) = 3.308, p < .05, first fixation, t(2)
= 4.015, p < 0.05, and returns, t(2) = 16.000, p < .005; and at 5,000 ms for first fixation, t(2) = 3.004,
p < .05, and last fixation, t(2) = 6.513, p < .05. These results are consistent with a signature that now
accounts for some of the time-dependent deficiencies of some of the individual measures.
5Discussion
The results from Experiments 1 and 2 confirm that accumulated fixation duration correlates with
preference better than chance, and combining it with measures such as the order of first fixation and
the number of returns to an image, which relate to sustained interest in the image, results in an ocu-
lomotor signature which correlates significantly better with the conscious preference decision (see
Figure 7).
These results confirm a strong relationship between the subjective decisions we consciously make
and the eye movements which precede expression of those conscious decisions using convention-
al methods such as button presses and questionnaire responses. More fundamentally, they demon-
Figure 7. Effect of using weighted combinations of oculomotor measures with the new subjective fitness function
described in Equation 3. The new measure performs consistently across all four image types and performance
improves monotonically with presentation time. All presentations were in the 8AFC configuration, 5,000 ms.

Using an oculomotor signature as an indicator of aesthetic preference 436
strate the usability of preferential looking paradigms with normal, healthy adult participants and not
just with observers who would have difficulty understanding a task or communicating a response
(Dobson, 1983; Teller, 1979). In addition, this work provides further support for the gaze cascade model
(Glaholt & Reingold, 2009; Shimojo et al., 2003) which suggests an increase in sustained interest that
is visible from fixations late in the presentation period. This correlation between accumulated fixation
duration and consciously expressed preference also lies at the heart of the gaze-driven evolutionary
algorithm (Holmes & Zanker, 2008) and the results from Experiments 1 and 2 further support the use
of eye movements as a fitness measure for aesthetic preference. This is because the fixation duration
represents a "better than chance" indication of preference and so can be used to provide the selection
pressure needed to drive an evolutionary optimization process. Early versions of the algorithm relied
on the specification of a task, such as "look for your preferred shape," to motivate the participant's eye
movements. While the active selection of a pleasing and stimulating visual environment has been sug-
gested to be a background task for humans (Berlyne, 1971; Biederman & Vessel, 2006), an oculomotor
signature, such as that developed here, which correlates with such a task could now be incorporated
in a free viewing version of the paradigm, which simply requires the participant to look at the images
evolving on screen without any explicit task specification. The removal of task specification, as well as
consciously articulated response, would provide a language-independent means for exploring complex
preferences relating to aesthetics. Early results using stimuli inspired by Op Artist Bridget Riley sug-
gest that the signature in Equation 3 can be used to generate aesthetically pleasing complex patterns in
the absence of a specific task (Holmes, 2010; Zanker, Voigt, & Holmes, 2010).
Clearly, the oculomotor signature developed here does not represent a comprehensively optimized
model for preferential looking, which would need to incorporate parameters for the presentation dura-
tion, the image complexity, and the complexity of the decision-making task, perhaps using pupilom-
etry with respect to the amount and variety of the choice (Holmes, 2010). However, the improved cor-
relation between looking and preference could facilitate better fitness estimation than fixation duration
alone in gaze-based computer interactions where aesthetic preference is used to drive an optimization
algorithm (Holmes & Zanker, 2008). The improved correlation between the new oculomotor signa-
ture and aesthetic preference would increase the selection pressure in that evolutionary algorithm and
accelerate the location of highly fit solutions (Goldberg, 1989) allowing more complex image spaces
to be searched without increasing the demands on the participant (Takagi, 1998, 2001, 2009). This
has important consequences for the nonreductionist investigation of visual aesthetic preference, since
such an approach is dependent on the availability of techniques which can manipulate and search
complex images.
The present experiments highlight the importance of the presentation time for the preferential
looking paradigm with normally functioning adults, especially with a measure such as the returns
measure used here. If presentations are too short for the number and complexity of images being
compared, then there is insufficient time to complete the bottom-upÂ­driven location phase of visual
search before initiating the top-downÂ­driven identification phase (Locher et al., 2007; Van der Lans
et al., 2008), which is important for a meaningful response to an aesthetic preference task (Glaholt &
Reingold, 2009). With short presentation times, it is possible that gaze-based measures such as the one
proposed here might better reflect image saliency than image preference (Itti & Koch, 2000), although
more recent evidence suggests that the looking behavior changes less during the course of viewing
than previously thought (Tatler, Hayhoe, Land, & Ballard, 2007), meaning that the benefit from pro-
longed exposure might simply be the result of longer fixations later in the time course (Glaholt & Rein-
gold, 2009). However, this interaction between a feed-forward and a feedback loop raises a question of
causality: Does fixation precede preference or preference precede fixation? Clearly, correlation results
such as those presented here cannot resolve this, and further investigation of this is needed. However,
the inclusion of this signature in a task-independent gaze-driven evolutionary algorithm does present
an opportunity for learning general trends in a participant's preference, through the frequencies of
specific image features in final population, and these can then be used to generate previously unseen
stimuli for a forced-choice task where the presentation duration is manipulated to verify the effects of
timing on actual preference (Zanker et al., 2010).
The oculomotor signature developed here is a quantitative behavioral measure which can be
used to evaluate aesthetic preference with highly complex visual stimuli without any prior knowl-
edge as to the contribution to that preference from individual features. As such, it already addresses
several concerns with experimental research into aesthetics including the ambiguity of qualitative
437 Holmes T, Zanker JM
results (Arnheim, 1974; Berlyne, 1971; Hassenzahl, 2008), the limitations imposed by the reductionist
methodologies (Arnheim, 1974) and the unreliability of conscious reflection on subjective decisions
(Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). Advances in technology are resulting in eye trackers that are more accurate,
easier to use, and more affordable. Moreover, off-the-shelf portable eye trackers now present the possi-
bility to study such signature oculomotor behaviors away from the laboratory facilitating quantitative
evaluation of artworks in their original forms as they were meant to be seen. It seems that in addition
to beauty itself and understanding of beauty might lie in the eyes of the beholder.
