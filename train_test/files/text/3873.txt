presidential elections using Big Data
and network analysis
Saatviga Sudhahar1, Giuseppe A Veltri2 and Nello Cristianini1
Abstract
The automated parsing of 130,213 news articles about the 2012 US presidential elections produces a network formed by
the key political actors and issues, which were linked by relations of support and opposition. The nodes are formed
by noun phrases and links by verbs, directly expressing the action of one node upon the other. This network is studied by
applying insights from several theories and techniques, and by combining existing tools in an innovative way, including:
graph partitioning, centrality, assortativity, hierarchy and structural balance. The analysis yields various patterns. First, we
observe that the fundamental split between the Republican and Democrat camps can be easily detected by network
partitioning, which provides a strong validation check of the approach adopted, as well as a sound way to assign actors
and topics to one of the two camps. Second, we identify the most central nodes of the political camps. We also learnt
that Clinton played a more central role than Biden in the Democrat camp; the overall campaign was much focused on
economy and rights; the Republican Party (Grand Old Party or GOP) is the most divisive subject in the campaign, and is
portrayed more negatively than the Democrats; and, overall, the media reported positive statements more frequently for
the Democrats than the Republicans. This is the first study in which political positions are automatically extracted and
derived from a very large corpus of online news, generating a network that goes well beyond traditional word-association
networks by means of richer linguistic analysis of texts.

Introduction
In all mature democracies, political elections are the
arena of enormous mobilisation of material and sym-
bolic resources, where the mobilisation of symbolic
resources is defined as the strategic use of words,
images and concepts to either persuade or influence
public opinion. The American presidential elections
are among the most interesting campaigns because of
the sheer amount of resources deployed and the influ-
ence of the United States on global governance.
This study presents a large-scale analysis of mass
media coverage of the 2012 US presidential elections,
combining automatic corpus linguistics methods and
network analysis to obtain a network representation
of the entire campaign coverage by the news media.
Mapping the full extent to which an electoral campaign
is represented by media offline and online constitutes a
very difficult challenge for researchers, given the large
amount of data and the multitude of sources available
in advanced democracies. In addition, whenever the full
coverage has been analysed, the core method used so
far has been traditional content analysis (in either the
automatic or manual coding variant), which allows us
to identify the most salient issues in each candidate's
campaign (e.g. Conway et al., 2012).

The traditional lines of investigation of the social sci-
ences, such as the ideological position of candidates, their
political communication strategy and the social represen-
tations (Moscovici and Duveen, 2000) of the election in
the media remain salient, but require new conceptual and
methodological approaches. We propose a Big Data
approach, based on automated information extraction.
Our study is based on the automated analysis of
130,213 news articles related to the US presidential elec-
tions from 719 news outlets, based on state-of-the-art
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) techniques, to extract information
about the key actors and their relations in the media
narrative of the US elections. These relations are in the
form of subject-verb-object (SVO) triplets extracted by
a parser, and are organised as a network, or semantic
graph, which can then be analysed with mathematical
tools. This approach goes well beyond traditional
word-association networks, producing not only dir-
ected links, but links whose semantic nature is retained
and understood. Much of the following analysis would
not be possible without these features, which ultimately
resulted from the use of a parser to identify noun
phrases and verbs to form SVO triplets. An example
of one such triplet is `Obama criticised Romney'.
This article is divided into different sections: first, we
discuss the theoretical framework that informed our
study, stating the importance of applying a semantic
graph approach to texts; second, we outline the novel
methodology employed to automate the analysis of
news media content. Third, we present our findings;
last, we conclude by reflecting on both theoretical and
methodological aspects of studying the network of
actors and actions.
Big Data analysis of news coverage
In this study, we analyse texts by an automatic identi-
fication of `semantic triplets', formed by key actors,
objects and their relationships. In particular, we con-
sider SVO triplets, following the approach developed
by Quantitative Narrative Analysis or QNA (Earl
et al., 2004; Franzosi, 1987). The core idea of QNA is
that SVO triplets form the fundamental units of narra-
tion. Our methodological contribution to that literature
has been to automate the extraction of triplets, by iden-
tifying subjects and objects with noun phrases and
using a parser. The set of triplets obtained is naturally
organised into a network, which we call a `semantic
graph'. The semantic graph encodes the relations
among all actors in the corpus. Note that sometimes
the expression `semantic graph' is used to indicate net-
works formed by linking co-occurring words, which is a
purely statistical approach that makes no use of more
detailed linguistic information. Instead, our process of
automatically extracting the SVO triplets from the
corpus is based on the use of a syntactical parser,
and is described in detail in the Appendix.
In the context of a news corpus about a political
election, we introduce a slightly different interpretation
of SVO triplets based on the observation that candi-
dates define their political positioning through a set of
claims or actions through which they either endorse or
oppose issues and actors. This interpretation will be
discussed in the next section. In this sense, SVO triplets
can be used as a source of political positioning infor-
mation. Extracting triplets and adding them in two
coherent semantic graphs provides a map of the candi-
dates' strategic positioning across a wide range of
issues. Manually generated semantic graphs have been
applied in several different collections of texts. For
example, Moretti (2013) decomposed novels into net-
work structures in which actors are linked by verbs. In
this approach, the properties of a text can be revealed
by the structural and topological features of the novel
network. Similarly, Mac Carron and Kenna (2012) ana-
lysed three classical mythological narratives comparing
the topological properties of their corresponding
narrative networks.
All these studies were necessarily limited in size
for being reliant on manual coding. However, some
progress has recently been made in the automatic cre-
ation of networks, the closest approach to ours being
Diesner et al. (2012) where statistical co-occurrence of
named entities is used to form networks. Also in this
case, however, the semantics of the link in the network
is only provided by statistical co-occurrence between
words and not by linguistic analysis.
Compared to these previous studies, we introduce
several methodological innovations that are character-
istic of a beneficial Big Data approach. This is a crucial
point: we not only `went big' by increasing the `reso-
lution' of the data collected but this is also the first time
such methodology has been applied on a Big Data
scale, by making use of syntactical parsers and a fully
automated text analysis pipeline. We have increased the
quality and resolution of the data obtained by auto-
matic extraction because this method goes well
beyond the traditional creation of networks based
on word co-occurrences. We have retained semantic
information by extracting SVO triplets and classifying
relationships in a signed network. It is the first time
that noun phrases are used rather than words. Our
automated infrastructure produced the network of
actors and their relations without human intervention,
starting from the corpus of 130,213 articles that we
have collected.
The mass media representation of the campaign
is decomposed into a signed network structure that
reveals relationships between the main actors ­ e.g.
2 Big Data & Society
Obama and Romney and the other objects (e.g. the
economy, Iraq, etc.). Besides analysing the overall cam-
paign network, we also extract the networks of each of
the candidates. The relationships between Obama and
Romney and other objects constitute their networks of
claims; the sign (positive or negative) of the edge indi-
cates the nature of the relationship.
Ideographs, rhetorical space and issues ownership
In the public sphere (Habermas et al., 1974), there are
competing definitions of public issues, within what is a
complex game played for semantic control (Gaskell
et al., 1998). This is particularly evident during the con-
text of political elections. Candidates define their polit-
ical positioning through a complex set of claims
through which they either endorse or oppose issues
and actors (both individuals and/or institutions). To
identify and map this multifaceted ideological and pol-
itical representative space, we start from the notion of
`ideographs' introduced by rhetorical theorists (McGee,
1980). Ideographs are ideological stances, expressed in
a few words, which define an actor's political identity.
They are the basic structural elements, or building
blocks, of ideology. Thus, they may be thought of as
`ideographs' for, like Chinese symbols, they signify and
contain a unique ideological commitment.
Interestingly, this observation complements the
approach commonly taken in QNA, where the emphasis
is on detecting `who did what to whom': here, by viewing
actions (and claims) as position statements, we can iden-
tify SVO triplets with political positioning claims (where
we only consider triplets linked by a verb that expresses
support or opposition for the object), and provide a
rigorous and effective representation of the rhetorical
and political space in which the candidates' positioning
takes place ­ this is achieved by embedding the resulting
network of triplets into a space as shown in the
`Network partitioning and embedding' section.
As part of our approach, we can also create graph-
ical descriptions of the overall positioning of an actor,
by operationalising and expanding McGee's notion of
ideograph into a network perspective to include any
graphs encoding all positive and negative statements
made by actors towards objects (i.e. other actors or
political issues). In this context, it is an important
observation that the decomposition of the network of
triplets leads to a meaningful distinction of two sub-
networks roughly corresponding to the `Democratic
Party' and `Republican Party' (Grand Old Party
(GOP)) semantic fields (see Figure 4). The embedding
of the network into a space can also be used to visualise
the political space in which positioning takes place (see
Figure 5). Subsets of the triplets centered on a specific
candidate can also be used to create candidate-specific
`ideographs', summarising the political position of an
actor (as further demonstrated in the Appendix).
The second important point is that our network is
constructed out of media reporting rather than from
direct quotations from candidates. In that respect, we
present how the online news `mediascape' has repre-
sented the positioning of Obama and Romney regard-
ing all issues that were deemed newsworthy.
The ideographs constructed on endorsement and
opposition claims can reveal if `issue ownership'
occurs. The theory of issue ownership rests on the prop-
osition that due to long-standing party reputations,
candidates are more likely to be perceived as having
credibility over certain issues `owned' by their party
(Campbell et al., 1966; Hamill et al., 1985). For
instance, voters see Republicans as being better able
to handle foreign policy and government management
issues, while the Democrats are perceived as more adept
on civil rights and social welfare issues. Prior research
suggests that these partisan issue associations are con-
sistent and well defined (e.g. Hayes, 2008; Petrocik,
1996). However, candidates do occasionally venture
into `enemy territory'. Specifically, Downs (1957)
argues that to appeal to the largest segment of voters,
candidates in a two-party system should cast some poli-
cies into the other's territory in order to convince voters
that their net position is closer to them. Thus, instances
of issue trespassing should be expected as a function of
normal campaign strategy (Hayes, 2008). The construc-
tion of a semantic graph, as previously described, which
represents the campaign and the two candidates' issue
networks, has the additional benefit of allowing the
identification of issue trespassing.
In this study, we formulate a number of typical
research questions from a social scientific perspective
within the context of our network approach to text and
media data. The questions that inform this study are:
1. How did the media `as a whole' report and represent
the campaign and the political positions of Obama
and Romney? How are the candidates positioned in
a political space by their actions of support and
opposition?
2. What do the semantic signed graphs of the two can-
didates reveal to us about their communication stra-
tegies and positioning?
3. What can the structure of an election's semantic
graph reveal to us, both in general and in this par-
ticular instance?
Topological properties of a semantic graph
The set of SVO triplets that we have extracted from the
news corpus can best be analysed when linked together
Sudhahar et al. 3
to form a network, which we call a `semantic graph'.
Graph partitioning methods can be deployed to embed
actors in a political space based on their relations with
other actors. The methodology is described in
Appendix A8. It is a remarkable observation that the
key political fault-lines are readily detected by this
approach.
We analyse other global properties, such as struc-
tural balance, assortativity and hierarchy, as well as
the centrality of nodes. The former provide insights
about the structural features of semantic graphs. The
latter reveal the roles played in the election by specific
actors or issues in the political `fields'.
There are a number of well-known measures of
centrality of nodes in a network including: betweenness
centrality, closeness centrality, out-degree, in-degree,
pagerank, hubs and authorities. We select some of
these in order to capture certain aspects of narrative
centrality. Different measures of centralities help us in
identifying nodes and their roles in the candidates'
semantic graphs. For example, degree centrality reveals
the most salient issues or actors; betweenness centrality
identifies issues or actors that have a bridging function
between clusters of issues/actors; and in-closeness
centrality helps us identify the nodes that act as `con-
textualisers'. We will discuss the interpretation of cen-
tralities in further detail in the section entitled
`Detecting the central actors in the semantic graphs'.
Methodology and data
Our software pipeline (Sudhahar et al., 2013) detects
election-related articles in large corpora, parses them,
extracts SVO triplets, and identifies key actors, objects
and actions. The triplets are then used to form a net-
work and the network is analysed. A detailed descrip-
tion of the pipeline architecture is available in
Appendix A5. The two guiding principles were for us
to be able to re-use existing tools where possible, and to
build a system that can be scaled up to large corpora.
The overall methodology represents an innovative com-
bination of existing techniques and tools applied to a
novel research aim that extracts meaningful networks
out of large textual datasets.
Dataset
The dataset used for this study is obtained using our
infrastructure, which is a media monitoring system
(Flaounas et al., 2011) that gathers and analyses news
items from the web from a large number of news out-
lets. English-language news articles related to the 2012
US elections were identified using an automatic text
classifier. The classifier was a support vector machine
(Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) trained and vali-
dated using the election news feed from Yahoo!, where
it achieved 83.46% precision (correct classification) and
73.29% recall. The dataset comprises 490 US and inter-
national media outlets in English for a total of 81,023
articles during the primaries (1 January 2012 to 1
August 2012); and 444 US and international media out-
lets in English for a total of 49,190 articles during the
election (1 August 2012 to 1 November 2012). In total,
130,213 articles were analysed from January to
November 2012 using the SVO triplets method.
Figure 1(a) shows the types of outlets and the
number of outlets in each type that were captured in
our analysis. The types of news outlets captured were
newspapers, broadcast media, blogs and online media
and magazines. Figure 1(b) shows the number of art-
icles collected from January to November by the 2012
Elections tagger.
The plot shows peaks of media attention for the
elections in January (during the Republican victory
in the primary contests in Iowa), September (during
the Democrat conventions), October (during the presi-
dential debates) and November (during the election day
and Obama's victory).

Filtering of relevant and reliable entities,
actions and triplets
As each step of our pipeline may be subject to error, we
rely on the large amount of data we collect in order to
maintain a clean dataset and correct classification/
extraction. This is done by filtering away uncertain
results at various stages of processing and introducing
the need to quantify the reliability and relevance of
a triplet, as well as that of the entities and their actions.
Appendix A4 discusses in detail how this step is
performed.
Positive and negative relations between entities
An important part of our study is that the verbs linking
entities are classified into those that show a positive or a
negative attitude (the remaining triplets are removed as
they are not relevant for our goal of detecting political
positions). So once we have identified a set of reliable
triplets, we can also assign a weight that quantifies the
relation of support or opposition between these two
entities. These claims or actions can then be interpreted
as `positioning statements' and be used to define the
political position of the actors involved.
We do this by assembling two lists of verbs, one sig-
nalling actions compatible with a positive attitude and
the other signalling a negative attitude. Verb lists denot-
ing political support/opposition are manually created by
going through actions in triplets that were extracted
from the elections corpus. Synonyms of these verbs
were then added to the lists using an online thesaurus
dictionary. Using the verb lists we could count a triplet
as a vote in favour of a positive or negative attitude, and
calculate a weight for each of the two possible relations.
The verb lists are available in Appendix A9.
In order to define the extent to which one actor a
supports/opposes an object or another actor b, we need
to combine the number of positive and negative state-
ments observed in the data connecting node a to node
b. We model this as the probability of observing a posi-
tive or a negative verb, when a is seen as acting on b,
therefore reducing this to the estimation of a Bernoulli
random variable. Bearing in mind the uncertainty
introduced by using finite (and possibly small) samples
of observations, we consider also the confidence of our
estimation of the parameter of the Bernoulli distribu-
tion associated to each oriented pair of actors (a,b).
This is done by using the Wilson score coefficient, a
standard approach in statistics, as described in
Appendix A2.
Once the entities and their relations are quantified
with the above methods we assemble them in a network
in which nodes represent entities/objects and edges rep-
resent positive/negative weights.
Results and discussion: Analysis
of networks
At the end of the software pipeline described above, we
have obtained 295,164 distinct triplets formed by
41,739 distinct actors and 3677 distinct verbs. After fil-
tering the actors and the triplets to identify the most
relevant and reliable ones, we are left with only 2275
distinct triplets (of course, observed multiple times) and
we kept only the 406 most significant actors and 609
(positive and negative) links.
The most reliable actors or links are obtained by
comparing their relative frequency in a topic-specific
corpus with that of a separate, static background
corpus or by their absolute number of mentions in
the text (explained in Appendix A4). However, this
measure of relevance is not appropriate in all domains.
When key entities in the topic-specific corpus are also
very widely used in the background corpus, the relevance
weighting will fail to give greater weighting to the most
important entities. In this case, key entities can be identi-
fied by their absolute number of mentions in the text as we
do for this study. Therefore, we use the top 100 most
frequent entities in the 2012 elections corpus as key enti-
ties. Triplets containing these key entities are considered
reliable if they have been seen in more than k independent
documents. The decision on k is explained in Appendix
A6. Finally, triplets containing these key entities are used
to create the network and this network contained the
most significant actors and links.
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the complete signed and
directed networks obtained from our pipeline during
the primaries phase (January to August) and the main
elections phase (August to November) in 2012. The
nodes in the network represent key entities and edges
represent positive/negative weights. The green/red
colour on the edges indicates positive/negative relations
and the size of the node represents the degree of
the node.
During the primaries we can see many hubs showing
different campaigns taking place within the Republican
camp (`Romney', `Santorum', `Gingrich', `Perry', `Cain')
besides the Obama campaign, while after the conventions
we see only the two huge campaigns by `Obama' and
`Romney', who were the dominant players.
Network partitioning and embedding
As discussed above, candidates define their political
positioning through a complex set of claims through
which they either endorse or oppose issues and actors,
which are captured in the network. Their positioning
takes place in the public sphere and is reported by the
media. We use this reported `political space' to map
such positioning, and the main challenge is whether
Sudhahar et al. 5
we can gain insights about this `space' from the net-
work of triplets.
A first analysis that can be performed on the net-
work is its partitioning by means of spectral decompos-
ition (see Appendix A8), which also has the effect of
assigning each node a `degree of membership' to one of
the two partitions. The results show that the two can-
didates and the two parties are naturally separated by
this method, a finding that provides a powerful sanity
check for the entire pipeline, as well as providing an
embedding of actors into a `political space' where prox-
imity is correlated to the amount of support (directly
and indirectly) linking them (Figures 4 and 5). This also
allows us to assign topics to one of the two camps: for
example, `Israel' was portrayed as being closer to the
Republican camp in 2012, while `Abortion' was closer
to the Democratic camp. The sub-networks resulting
from the partition are shown in Figures 6 and 7.
Assortativity, hierarchy and structural balance
The next step is to analyse the overall topological prop-
erties of the entire network. Assortativity refers to a
preference for a network's nodes to attach to others
Figure 2. Network with positive and negative edges between entities (US presidential election data: Primaries 2012).
6 Big Data & Society
that are in some way similar. Though the specific meas-
ure of similarity may vary, network theorists often
examine assortativity in terms of a node's degree.
Correlations between nodes of similar degree are
often found in the mixing patterns of many observable
networks. For instance, in social networks, highly con-
nected nodes tend to be connected with other high
degree nodes. On the other hand, technological and
biological networks typically show disassortative
mixing, or dissortativity, as high-degree nodes tend to
attach to low-degree nodes. We measured assortativity
and hierarchy, finding that the network is not assorta-
tive but hierarchical. The interpretation of such
structural features is open because there are no clear
pre-existing studies about semantic networks and their
assortative mixing. We further develop this point in the
discussion, while the technical steps carried out in our
testing are reported in the Appendix.
We also analysed the structural balance of the net-
work (Cartwright and Harary, 1956; Davis, 1967). This
notion (defined in more detail in the Appendix)
attempts to capture the natural property of networks

expressing the attitude (positive or negative) among
nodes: reciprocity (if A likes B then B should like A)
and transitivity (if A likes B, and if B likes C, we would
expect that A likes C).
The results show that while at the level of dyads
(pairs of nodes) there is strong balance (or reciprocity),
at the level of triads (three nodes) there is significant
imbalance. One of the main reasons for this is the pres-
ence of many triads where the two candidates profess to
support the same issue, while still remaining critical of
each other (the technical Appendix reports on the
detailed definitions, findings and statistical tests asso-
ciated with structural balance).
Detecting the central actors in the
semantic graphs
The next step is to analyse each of the two candidates'
networks. One of the most important questions is the
identification of the `central' issues or actors in each
political camp during the campaign as reported by the
media data that we have collected. Given the complete
network of all actors and their relations, we explored
various measures to quantify the centrality of actors.
The transposing and interpreting of centrality meas-
ures into semantic graphs is still a work in progress and
there is no completely validated way of doing this. This
is particularly true in our case, in which we go beyond
the use of simple co-occurrences to generate the links
between nodes. We selected a number of centralities
that have been used before in the context of semantic
graphs (Doerfel, 1998; Kim, 2011; Yuan et al., 2013).
We used the degree of a node as the basic measure of
prominence, as it indicates the number of other actors
or issues a given actor directly interacts with (Freeman,
1979). This often ­ but not necessarily ­ correlates with
the frequency with which the actor is mentioned in the
corpus.

Sudhahar et al. 9
Because we have a directed network, we can com-
pute the in-closeness centrality of nodes (Carrington
et al., 2005), which measures the degree to which a
node can be easily reached `from' other nodes (i.e.
using edges coming in towards the node) where
`easily' means the shortest distance. In a semantic
graph, a node with a high in-closeness positions itself
closest to the centre of reference playing a `connotative'
role or, in other words, a `qualifier' or `contextualiser'.
Betweenness has been measured to identify those nodes
that are crucial in holding together the network and
connecting different clusters of issues or actors (the
nodes with high betweenness centrality are translated
as active mediators in the communication).
Last, we used the notion of hubs and authorities: a
high authority actor receives links from many good
hubs (highly connected actors). In the context of our
network, we interpret authority as a proxy for an
agenda-setting item in both active and passive terms1
(further technical details are available in the Appendix).
We can also apply the tools described above to ana-
lyse the two sub-networks obtained by partitioning the
overall election network (see Appendix for the parti-
tioning method). The detailed results of that analysis
are presented in the Appendix A10, but the main find-
ings are as follows.
Democratic camp. The highest degree objects in the
Democratic campaign are: Obama, President, Clinton,
Americans, Economy and Campaign. This indicates
that the economy was the most salient issue upon
which the campaign focused, with the discussion of a
`Plan' to recover the US economy. The objects with the
highest betweenness centralities in the Democratic net-
work were: Obama, President, Campaign, Clinton,
Americans, Biden and Speech, showing how these enti-
ties were the bridges linking the otherwise separate
aspects of the electoral narrative. The objects with the
highest in-closeness centrality in Obama's network
include: `Campaign', `Law', `Redistribution', `Pledge',
`Ads', `Overhaul', `Biden', `Investments', etc. These
objects are a mixture of policy and economic tools
(law, redistribution, overhaul of a policy, investments)
and contexts (Campaign, Ads, Pledge). Objects with
high authority can help us to define the agenda-setting
efforts of each of the two parties. In the Democratic
network, we can find: Obama/President, Economy,
Plan, Rights, Proposals, Efforts, Biden/Vice-President,
Speech, Remarks, Election, Policies and Campaign.
Besides the expected presence of Obama and Biden,
the other objects are indicative of a campaign strongly
focused on the economy and on actions and tools (plan,
proposals, efforts, policies) combined with an emphasis

degree.

on rights. In the above discussion about issue owner-
ship during US presidential campaigns, the latter topic
has traditionally been a Democrat theme. It appears
that the 2012 campaign was very much focused on
the `Economy' and `Rights' for the Democrats ­ the
agenda-setting effort was directed towards these two
issues.
Republican camp. The top two objects in terms of degree
centrality in the Republican network are Mitt Romney
and Paul Ryan, followed by two nouns: People
and Plans, which refer to the Republican initiative of
prescriptions for the US economy. In the case of the
Republican network, the objects with high betweenness
centralities are all actors: `Romney', `Ryan', `People'
and `Republicans'. It was also the case for the
Democratic network that actors were the most bridging
objects. However, it appears that for the Republican
network there are the two candidates ­ Romney and
Ryan ­ and then the `People' or the Republican Party.
In the Republican network, we find high in-closeness
centrality for objects such as: `Amendment', `Work',
`Proposal' and `Breaks'. Some of them come from the
Republican campaigns but others are forced upon
them. The highest object in terms of authority is
`Romney'. This is followed by `Plans', `People',
`Decision' and `Proposal', all of which are keywords
of Romney's campaign and language. However, there
are two objects suggestive of a reaction rather than an
initiative in terms of agenda setting: `Mourdock', `Bill'
and `Public Broadcasting'. All three objects are related
to attacks from Obama's campaign (see Appendix).
`Israel' is also present among the objects with high
authority and refers to Romney's speech in Israel
about US foreign policy in the Middle East. The
remaining objects with high authority are what now
with hindsight appear to be important issues in the
2012 Republican campaign: tax breaks (Breaks), the
amendment to the federal marriage law (Amendment)
and the work requirements for welfare benefits (Work).
Positive and negative statements, and
divisive issues
Actors can choose to signal their position in the polit-
ical space by either making negative statements about
what they do not stand for, or positive statements
about what they do stand for. We have considered
how often an actor is reported as making positive
or negative statements about another actor or issue.
Similarly, we have considered how often an actor is
the target of positive or negative statements or actions.
In other words, we have measured how often actors
position themselves by their opposition to or support
for something or someone. We also measured the extent
to which an object is `divisive' ­ in that it attracts
very different sets of statements ­ and therefore how
important it is for political positioning by both parties.
The most divisive subjects and objects in the network. Since
we have positively and negatively signed networks, it is
possible to assess the divisiveness of subjects or objects
in the network. This will examine the target or source
nodes of diverse sign links (positive and negative) or
same sign links (positive or negative) in the network.
To identify the most divisive objects, for each node we
take into account all the incoming edges and count how
many were positive (p) and negative (n). Treating this
as a Bernoulli random variable, we use its variance to
measure how divisive the object is. More details on this
are given in the Appendix A3.
Table 1 shows the most divisive subjects and objects
in our network. Among the subjects we find the main
actors of American politics and of the 2012 campaign.
The presence of the GOP (the Republican Party) at the
top of the list confirms what was discussed previously
about how much more divisive the Republicans had to
be by comparison to the Democrats. We detect that the
most divisive objects in the campaign concern either the

economic split between the two camps (tax breaks,
economy) or the social split between them (gay mar-
riage), while it is also confirmed that the Clintons
remain very polarising figures.
Positive object ratio analysis of the election network. We
experiment with positive object ratios (PORs) for
Obama and Romney, which could reveal their cam-
paign representations in the media dataset. We also
analyse this for the overall network. The POR for a
candidate is computed using equation (1). Po
refers to
the number of positive statements/expressions made by
the candidate about an object and No
refers to the
number of negative statements/expressions made by
the candidate towards the same object. The overall
POR is computed by taking into account the total
number of positive/negative statements towards an
object.
POR ¼
Po À No
Po þ No
ð1Þ
From Figure 8, a number of interesting questions
can be answered. For example, was the media reportage
of the 2012 electoral campaign biased towards one of
the two parties? The overall positive objects ratio plot
in Figure 8 provides the answer, albeit within the limi-
tations of the methodology applied in this study. This
quantity reflects the number of times an actor has been
the object in a SVO triplet with a positive verb. The two
objects `Democrats' and `Republicans' are present in
different quadrants: the `Democrats' are reported as
being (slightly) more often the object of positive state-
ments or actions, while the Republicans are more often
the object of negative statements or actions.
From Figure 8, we also learn that both vice-presi-
dent candidates, Biden and Ryan, had mildly negative
reporting. Above all, the chart confirms the extreme
importance played by the status of the US economy
as the main issue towards which the campaign gravi-
tated. `Economy', `Money', `Jobs' and `Taxes' are the
main focus of the reporting and also of both
candidates.
Comparing the two campaigns
Democratic camp. Barack Obama's ideograph provides
us with Figure 9: on the Y axis we have the POR of
objects linked to Obama (the weight vector for outgo-
ing links only) and on the X axis their frequency. The
two top items that were most positively referred to by
Obama are `Nomination' and `Supporters' and this is
not particularly surprising. The other objects present in
Figure 9 reveal a more interesting picture.
Figure 10. Candidate Romney: overall positive objects ratio vs. frequency.
Sudhahar et al. 13
As discussed previously, issue ownership in US
presidential elections traditionally assigns an advantage
to the Republican Party in using the economy as a
campaign issue (Campbell et al., 1966; Hamill et al.,
1985). However, the 2012 elections saw an `issue tres-
passing' strategy with President Obama taking the ini-
tiative on the `economy'. This is evident from the fact
that objects such as `financing', `redistribution' and
`investments' have a high POR.
The other defining issue related to the economy
was jobs creation: the object `jobs' has a mildly negative
ratio indicating that the media reported Obama out-
comes in jobs creation less effectively. Further, two
important and defining issues of the campaign, repre-
sented in Figure 9, are `Rights' and `Law'. `Rights' refer
to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. `Law'
also refers to the amendment to the federal marriage
law. These issues were important for President Obama
but they were also an important focus of Mitt
Romney's representation in the media.
On the negative part of the chart, we found a rather
frequent disapproval of `plans'. This is due to the topic
of the Republican `economic plans'. The US economy
and economic policy is also highly relevant in the nega-
tive part of the chart, with a perhaps obvious negative
link to the recession and with the Republican recipe for
federal government budget cuts.
Republican camp. The two top positive objects in
Romney's signed network according to Figure 10 are
`Nomination' and `Supporters', as is the case for
Obama's signed network. The other very frequent and
positive objects are: `Work', `Rights', `Legislation',
`Ownership' and `Proposal'. `Work' refers to the debate
over the work requirements necessary to access welfare
benefits: Romney, who strongly supported this measure,
accused Obama of wanting to remove such requirements.
`Changes' is also a highly positive object linked to
Romney in the mass media data. It refers to one of the
mottos of Romney's campaign about changing the cur-
rent status of the US and trying to re-appropriate the
concept of change from Obama that was used as a
slogan in his first presidential campaign (`Change').
At the opposite end of the chart we find the item
most negatively linked to Romney: Taxes. This rela-
tionship reflects the great emphasis given by Romney
and the Republican Party to tax cuts and breaks as the
economic solution to recession, something confirmed
by the presence of other relevant objects in Figure 10
(`Benefits', `Cuts', etc.).
Romney is negatively linked to the object `Unions',
perhaps unsurprisingly, because of his critical com-
ments about US labour unions and in particular of
his opposition to the Employee Free Choice Act. The
object `Bailout' refers to Romney's statements against
the car industry federal bailout in Michigan (his home
state), which was a major moment during the campaign
as his opposition created problems for his own
campaign.
The object `Amnesty' refers to the amnesty given to
illegal immigrants by the Obama administration. This
issue is negative and linked to Romney because his pos-
ition on this issue was confused during the campaign;
from an initial critique he later declared that he would
not revoke the amnesty. Media data widely reported his
ambivalence on the topic.
Among the non-economic issues, three topics have
been identified in the negative quadrant: abortion, the
amendment to the marriage law and women. The first
two are issues about civil rights and are negatively
linked to Romney. The difference between Obama
and Romney here is evident: Obama continued the
`issue ownership' of the Democrats on rights in add-
ition to his personal history while Romney re-affirmed
traditional Republican positions on abortion and
marriage.
Conclusions
Analysing the media coverage of the US election using
our Big Data approach revealed the strategic position-
ing of actors around issues in the `mediascape' of online
English language news. We used a semantic graph
obtained by parsing the text, identifying the noun
phrases and the verbs and linking them and used
SVO triplets as building blocks for a network. This
approach is innovative and has never been applied to
a real-world dataset of this scale. Using media data and
transposing signed relationships in a graph, we uncov-
ered the unique mixture of endorsements and disap-
proval that constitute the Republican and Democratic
camps. It is a remarkable finding that the spectrum of
political positions can be reliably recovered from the set
of claims attributed to each actor by the media report-
ing. The split of the network into the two main camps
provides strong evidence that the main political rela-
tions can be extracted by this approach.
Results suggest that the 2012 campaign was charac-
terised by Obama's strategy of defending his record on
the economic policy and `owning the issue', by his being
`on the attack' about a number of issues and forcing
Romney and the Republicans to be defensive about
salient issues. The set of triplets show that the 2012
campaign was very much focused on the issues of the
US economy and civil rights for the Democrats. The
agenda-setting effort was directed towards these two
areas. Obama challenged the traditional Republican
issue ownership about the economy. Other major
actors who played an important role for Obama
and Romney were Bill Clinton and Paul Ryan.
14 Big Data & Society
Overall, media reporting contained more frequently
positive statements about the Democrats than the
Republicans. Overall, the Republicans were more fre-
quently the object of negative statements either by
Democrats or other actors. The Republican Party
(GOP) is the most divisive subject in the campaign,
and is portrayed in a more negative fashion than the
Democrats.
The topological features of these semantic graphs are
less straightforward ­ and perhaps more interesting to
interpret. The network's structurally unbalanced nature
marks a difference with social networks. The presence
of unclosed triplets indicates that latent and unrealised
ties might be common in semantic graphs in which
there is less obligation to be `coherent'. Most likely,
this is because of the specific event under investigation:
a political campaign. Another structural characteristic
was the disassortative nature of the network, with high-
degree nodes connecting with low-degree nodes and
vice versa. In disassortative networks, well-connected
nodes join a much larger number of less well-connected
nodes. This is typical for biological and technological
networks. Real-world social networks are usually
assortative because in real life2 everyone in a society
would like to connect with elites, while the elites
would rather communicate with those who share the
same social status. In our case, we studied a political
campaign and proposed that a disassortative network
might represent the network translation of a mobilisa-
tion campaign operated by the candidates.
This study was made possible by the use of a com-
putational infrastructure for the collection and analysis
of `Big Data' representing an example of the applica-
tion of techniques to gain insight about societal phe-
nomena. AI and text mining techniques were used to
detect election-related articles, parse their content,
extract the key actors in a narration and their relations,
forming a network whose topology has then been ana-
lysed. We believe that our methodology represents a
substantial step forward in the linguistic analysis of
texts by means of extracting relational data. The
future will include making better use of the information
coming from the parser, which can go well beyond the
simple SVO structure of sentences and focus also on
automating the creation of positive/negative verb lists
using the tool OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005).
A network approach to text based on semantic
graphs is a promising approach to analysing large cor-
pora of texts and, with a clear application in mapping
`mediascapes', in cases of specific events and potentially
also longitudinally.

Notes
1. The rationale behind this is that highly connected nodes ­
in our case mostly the two candidates ­ make constant
reference to these nodes (objects). In the context of a cam-
paign, this may be interpreted as the outcome of an
agenda-setting effort. However, some objects might
appear as having high authority because of the need for
a candidate to respond to a direct attack. In other words,
authority could be considered a proxy of both active and
passive (forced upon) agenda setting.

A2 ­ Estimation of Bernoulli parameter using
Wilson coefficient
A possible approach to quantifying the weight of a
relation between entity a and entity b is to consider a
confidence interval around our estimate of the value of
that relation. This will relate to the estimation of the
parameter of a Bernoulli distribution, so that we can
then calculate the confidence interval around this
16 Big Data & Society
estimate by using standard methods. We use the Wilson
score confidence interval (Wilson, 1927) for a Bernoulli
parameter given by,

p is the fraction of positive observations, z=2
is
the (1 À /2) quantile of the standard normal distribu-
tion and n is the total number of observations. The final
score of our links should be associated to a function of
the proportion of positive triplets, which is possible in
this case since: (P À N)/(P þ N) ¼ 2P/(P þ N) À 1; then
observing that P/(P þ N) is the rate of positive men-
tions, we can treat the estimation of this quantity like
the estimation of parameters of a Bernoulli distribu-
tion. This score is computed using the lower bound of
the Wilson interval. For a confidence level of 95% the
value for z=2
is 1.96. This can be approximated to 2
and a simplified version of the Wilson score interval can
be obtained by considering the number of positive (P)
and negative (N) triplets found between any two entities
a and b. The final weight on the links becomes,

side of the mean. When a positive/negative relation is
supported by many independently generated triplets
(from k different documents), i becomes smaller and
the resulting network would contain the most reliable
information. Hence we can introduce a threshold to the
percentage of i and accept relations only if i lies below
this threshold. We provide details on how we select this
threshold in the validation section.
A3 ­ Variance of Bernoulli as measure of
divisiveness in objects
We compute the variance score Sv
for each node as
shown in equation (2). Sorting the nodes according to
the score would give us a ranking of objects from the
most divisive to the less divisive. The same could be
done to find out the most divisive subjects by looking
at the outgoing links of nodes.

A4 ­ Relevance and reliability of entities, actions
and triplets
There is a need to quantify the reliability and the rele-
vance of a triplet, as well as entities and actions to
reduce the amount of errors in our output. To tackle
this problem, we first define both the weight of an entity
and action. These weights may differ for different appli-
cations and tasks, but allow for the ranking and selec-
tion of the most relevant or reliable information to
include in the network. Relevance of entities or actions
to a specific topic can be gauged by comparing their
relative frequency in a topic-specific corpus with that of
a separate, static background corpus. Equation (5)
shows the weighting method,
wi ¼
f ði, D1Þ
f ði, D2Þ
ð5Þ
Where wi
refers to the weight of the entity/action i;
f ði, D1Þ and f ði, D2Þ refer to the frequency of the entity/
action in a given corpus D1
and a background corpus
D2
, respectively. The highest weighted entities/actions
can be considered as key entities/actions in the given
corpus.
However, this measure of relevance is not appropri-
ate in all domains when key entities in the topic-specific
corpus are also very widely used in the background
corpus, the relevance weighting will fail to give greater
weighting to the most important entities. In this case,
key entities can be identified by their absolute number
of mentions in the text as we do for the elections study.
Therefore we use the top 100 most frequent entities
in the 2012 elections corpus as key entities. In this
study we are interested in analysing networks of posi-
tive/negative relationships between entities and hence
we use all actions denoting political support or
opposition identified in the corpus for the analysis.
Triplets containing key entities are considered reliable
if they have been seen in more than k independent
documents.
A5 System pipeline
We describe here the software pipeline that we have
used in our experiments. The two guiding principles
were for us to re-use existing tools where possible,
and to make a system that can scale to large corpora.

. News corpus ­ The system uses articles contained in
an available news corpus to perform the task.
. Extract data ­ We could first extract the content
from articles that are specific to a domain which is
of interest to the analysis, e.g. crime, elections,
sports, etc.
. Co-reference resolution ­ The text in every indivi-
dual article is processed for named entity co-refer-
ence resolution. The Orthomatcher module in
ANNIE Information extraction system in General
Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE)
(Cunningham, 2002) distribution is used to perform
this task.
. Anaphora resolution ­ Once the co-references have
been resolved the Pronominal resolution module in
ANNIE is used to perform anaphora resolution. The
system solves pronouns in all forms that are identi-
fied by GATE.
. Minipar parser ­ We use the parser Minipar (Lin,
2003) to parse the above processed text. The parser
tags each word of the sentence with its grammatical
relation to it. Minipar has its own limitations since it
cannot parse sentences more than 1024 characters
long. On the other hand, we found that this length
exceeds the size of a typical sentence in the news
which is made of approximately 500 characters.
. Extract triplets ­ From the Minipar parser output
we extract words tagged with s (subject), i (verb) and
obj (object of the verb) relations. A SVO triplet is
formed out of these words if the s, i, obj relations are

. Store in triplet DB ­ All extracted triplets are stored in
the Triplets database along with the article informa-
tion from which they were extracted. This includes,
article date, title, content and article feed URL. We
also store the Minipar parser output for each article.
. Weight entities and actions ­ Entities (subject/object
of triplet) and actions are weighted according to
equation (2) and this weight is used to rank and
select the highest ranking candidates as key entities
and key actions.
. Filter triplets with key entities and actions ­ We then
filter the triplets that have key entities as subjects/
objects and key actions as verbs.
. Create networks ­ Directed networks are created
with the triplets where the nodes are entities and
the edges are actions linking them. To create net-
works we use Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003)
which is a general platform for complex network
analysis and visualization. We also used JUNG3
for automatically generating networks and analysing
network properties.
. Weight positive and negative relations between enti-
ties ­ Positive and negative relations indicate friend-
ship or hostility between actors like mentioned
before. In order to identify the strength of these rela-
tions we introduce a weighting method which is
shown in equation (3). This would result in entities
linked by a positive/negative link with weights.
. Create signed networks ­ We create signed networks
where nodes are entities and edges are the positive/
negative links with weights.
. Spectral graph partitioning ­ Signed networks are
partitioned using spectral graph partitioning methods
to assess the degree to which actors/objects belong to
or are in favor of one of two parties, in the assump-
tion that the networks are naturally organised into
two main communities. We used the JAMA4 matrix
package for java to perform this task.
. List of entities showing partitions ­ Once the net-
work is partitioned we obtain a list of entities
which shows the association of them to one of the
two communities in the network.
A6 Validation
Estimating the performance of our methodology is a
difficult but important task since there are no accessible
corpora that have been annotated in terms of SVO
triplets that we can use in order to measure the preci-
sion and recall of our method, and there are no other
networks of actors/objects that have been generated by
hand, based on a corpus. Nonetheless, we can measure
various aspects, in order to increase our confidence in
the method, and obtain a rigorous statistical estimate of
performance.
Validation of triplets
We used a corpus covering the Civil Rights movement
in Northern Ireland for which 72 manually extracted
triplets were available (De Fazio, 2013). We applied our
methodology, without filtering `reliable' triplets due to
the limitations of the data. Our method extracted 66
triplets, of which 41 were correct and 31 were missed.
This gives us 62% precision and 57% recall in the very
unfavourable case when we cannot use any filtering for
reliable triplets. This means that there is a 38% prob-
ability of a triplet being incorrect, if it has been seen just
once. If we use this figure as the error rate for triplets
seen once, we can use it in a model for the probability
of error in triplets seen more than k times, which would
be 0.38k. This is true under the assumption that the
triplets seen more than k times are independently gen-
erated. By only selecting triplets that are seen at least
three times we achieve a 5% error rate. But we use
higher values for k according to the Wilson score
model.
Sudhahar et al. 19
We also analysed by hand 75 triplets coming from
the 2012 US election campaign, and checked how many
were actually present in the articles that were indicated
by our pipeline as supporting them. Of 75, 72 were
actually present in the article achieving 96% precision.
This gives us a clear estimate of precision after our
filtering step, but no estimation of recall, which we
expect to be low.
Validation of the networks
Our next validation method was intended to measure
the extent to which our analysis captures the division
into two camps of the US political actors/objects. We
use permutation testing (Annis, 2005; Good, 2005;
Welch, 1990), a central part of non-parametric test-
ing. It directly obtains the distribution of the test
statistic under the null hypothesis by calculating all
possible values of the test statistic under rearrange-
ments of the treatments (labels) on the observed data
points. The one-sided p value of the test is calculated
as the proportion of sampled permutations where the
test statistic is greater than or equal to that in the
original dataset.
We obtain the eigenvalue distance d between the
`Republicans' and the `Democrats' in the entity list
and use it as the test statistic. We compare it with dis-
tance d1
obtained by taking the distance between the
same actors from 100 randomised networks. Here we
use two random network models, Erdo
¨ s­Re
´ nyi (Erdo
¨ s
and Re
´ nyi, 1960) and Random re-wiring to generate the
random networks.
Finally we check for the number of times r that
d1
! d in the 100 random networks to calculate the p
value which is r/100. Table 2 shows the resulting p
values obtained for experiments performed on the
2012 and the previous election cycles. It shows that
the p value is very low for the same signal appearing
by chance. Therefore we could say that the network
topology contains meaningful information.
We also checked the effect on p values when different
thresholds are introduced to the confidence interval i in
our weighting equation (3) which is, i ¼ 2
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
P:N
PþN
þ1
p
PþNþ4
. This
helped us to select an optimal threshold for i. We expect
that p value of the resulting network should be 0.01
and the network should contain more information as
possible. Table 3 shows the p values obtained for dif-
ferent thresholds of i according to the two randomisa-
tion models. According to our selection criteria 35% is
considered optimal since in both cases the p value
is 0.01 and also the network is large enough and con-
tains more information.
We also note that the p values are not significant for
values of i in two different cases. For example in
Table 3 when i is low (13%, 17%, 20%, 23%) we see
that the p values are insignificant and this could be
because the network contains less information. On the
other hand, when values for i are very high (43%) the
network contains more noise, which in turn causes the
signal to disappear and therefore leads to insignificant p
values. Networks for i ¼ 32% and 35% are the most
significant according to Table 3 and 35% fits our
criterion.
The statistical significance study on the elections net-
work and the precision estimates performed on the tri-
plets we have extracted point in the same direction: that
our system extracts very precise information that repre-
sents the true relations among the entities in the corpus.
Estimating the recall would be harder, but since we
work in the setting of very large datasets, we choose
to focus on obtaining high precision rather than high
recall.

A7 ­ Properties of networks
A number of statistical properties have been developed
to capture features of social networks (Mac Carron and
Kenna, 2012). Some structural properties are quantified
using the characteristic path length l, the longest geo-
desic lmax and the clustering coefficient C. In this sec-
tion we will discuss various properties of networks
which are prevalent in real world networks and com-
pare it with the results obtained for election networks.
Hierarchical networks. Complex networks have a modu-
lar structure implying that groups of nodes organise in
a hierarchical manner into increasingly larger groups.
Hierarchical networks are characterised by a power law
dependency of the clustering coefficient C(k) on the
node degree according to equation (6). This implies
that while nodes with a small degree are part of
highly cohesive, densely interlinked clusters, the hubs
in the network are not, as their neighbors have a small
chance of linking to each other. Therefore the hubs play
the important role of bridging the many small commu-
nities of clusters into a single, integrated network.
CðkÞ $
1
k
ð6Þ
We tested for hierarchical structure in the networks
by plotting the average clustering coefficient C(k) vs.
degree k. Figure 13a shows the plot in a log­log
scale. The nodes with a smaller degree present higher
clustering than those with a larger degree and the decay
approximately follows equation (6). This indicates that
the nodes with a low degree are part of densely inter-
linked clusters, while the nodes with a high degree,
which are the hubs, bring together the many small com-
munities of clusters into a single, integrated network.
Candidates' ideograms are attempts at creating
an organic network of issues (objects) and actors
(subjects). Moreover, the hierarchical structure of the
semantic graph represents the hierarchical nature of
concepts indicating the presence of overarching hubs
that represent semantic domains (for example, the
`economy', `civil rights', etc.).
Assortativity. Assortativity is the measure of the prefer-
ence of nodes to attach to other similar or dissimilar
nodes. Assortativity is high when high-degree nodes
tend to connect to other high-degree nodes; it is low
when high-degree nodes are linked to low-degree
nodes. Assortativity can also be tested by plotting the
degree of the neighbours knn
of a vertex as a function of
its degree k. A positive slope indicates assortativity and
a negative slope indicates disassortativity.
Figure 13b plots the average hknn
i of the degrees of the
neighbours of vertices of degree k. It shows
the disassortative nature of the network where high-
degree nodes tend to connect with low-degree nodes
and vice versa. This could represent a network expression
of a `mobilisation' of symbolic resources. Real-world

social networks are usually assortative because in real life
everyone would like to connect with the elites in a society;
whereas the elites would rather communicate with those
who share their own social status. The only times when
elites appeal to the masses are special occasions such as
political elections. In a semantic graph, the disassortative
nature of the network can be interpreted as the mobilisa-
tion of candidates on many different issues, even marginal
ones, to attract the largest amount of voters possible. In
other words, it represents the semantic equivalent of poli-
tical rallies in small towns that, nevertheless might have
some significance for the overall electoral result.
Structural balance of networks. In addition to the contri-
bution to communication theory and political science
literature, we aim to contribute to the current debate on
structural balance theory in social networks. Structural
balance theory originated in social psychology during
the mid-twentieth century. As formulated by Heider
(1946) in the 1940s, and subsequently cast in graph-
theoretic language by Cartwright and Harary (1956),
structural balance considers the possible ways in
which triangles on three individuals can be signed
and posits that triangles with three positive signs
(three mutual friends) and those with one positive
sign (two friends with a common enemy) are more plau-
sible and hence should be more prevalent in real net-
works than triangles with two positive signs
(two enemies with a common friend) or none (three
mutual enemies). Balanced triangles with three positive
edges exemplify the principle that `the friend of my
friend is my friend', whereas those with one positive
and two negative edges capture the notions that `the
friend of my enemy is my enemy', `the enemy of my
friend is my enemy' and `the enemy of my enemy is my
friend'.
Even though balance theory has been intended for
undirected networks, it has also been applied to direc-
ted networks by ignoring direction. The work by
Leskovec et al. (2010) analysed theories of balance
and status in the context of social media sites using
the triad configurations of their networks, investigating
the extent to which each theory helped explain the link-
ing behavior of users on these sites. Hassan et al. (2012)
compare the predictions of network edge signs made by
their system to the structural balance theory by count-
ing the frequencies of different types of triads in the
predicted network.
We study structural balance in our election networks
based on closed triads, which are acyclic or cyclic and
mutual dyads. The acyclic triad depicts transitivity. The
triad involving actors i, j and k is transitive if whenever
i ! j and j ! k then i ! k (Wasserman, 1994). A
mutual dyad occurs when i ! j and j ! i. According
to Heider, we know the rules for balance in transitive
triads and mutual dyads, but in the case of cyclic triads
we introduce rules for balance.
There are six possible closed triads for transitivity in
a network and four possible closed triads for the cyclic
case. Figure 14 shows the six different configurations of
transitive triads and four configurations of cyclic triads
with the number of transitive and cyclic triples in each

case. We analyse structural balance in transitive and
cyclic triads for all these configurations separately.
When considering positive and negative signs on
triads there could be eight types for a single transitive
triad as shown in Figure 15. According to the balance
theory cases 1, 2, 7 and 8 are balanced. For the cyclic
case there could be four types as Figure 16 shows. We
consider a cyclic triad balanced when the product of the
signs is positive. Since (À1)n is = þ1 for n = even and
equal to À1 for n = odd, any network path containing
an even number of opposition statements indicates a
support from the root to the leaf of the path. Since
we assume that any agent should not be critical of
itself, we expect that all closed cycles will contain
only an even number of negative edges, in order to be
self consistent. Hence cases 1 and 2 are balanced. In a
mutual dyad there could be two positives (1), two nega-
tives (2) or one positive and one negative (3). In this
case (1) and (2) are balanced.
We present our results on structural balance for each
type of triad shown in Figure 14. This includes the
analysis of structural balance in transitive, cyclic
triads and mutual dyads in networks of different sizes
from the US elections.
In all the configurations in Figure 14 we analyse the
transitive, cyclic triads and the mutual dyads separately
for structural balance. Our experiments are based on 11
election networks of different sizes N. We generate
these networks by using different confidence thresholds
for Wilson score shown in equation (3). For each net-
work we calculate the fraction of balanced triads Tb
and then recalculate the same value Tr
for 100
random networks. We generate 100 random networks
by removing signs from triads and producing them
randomly but keeping the fraction of positive links fp
in the network the same. We count the number of times
m that Tr
4 Tb
, hence our p value pT
is estimated as
follows:
pT ¼
m
100
ð7Þ
Table 4 shows the scores for Tb
and pT
for the total
number of transitive triads found in all types of triads
in Figure 14. In Table 5 we report the scores for each
triad type separately. Tn
refers to the number of tran-
sitive triads in each case. According to Table 4 we see
that pT
is very high and 14% < Tb
< 38%, which indi-
cates very poor structural balance overall. In Table 5
we see that type 1 and type 3 triads contribute signifi-
cantly to the overall imbalance since the majority of
imbalanced transitive triads lie in these configurations.
When carefully looking at the signs in triad type 1
and 3 we find that the most dominating transitive triad
is the one with three negative links (À,À,À). For triad
type 3 in the majority of the cases the signs on the
mutual edge were negative. Therefore according to
this triad type 2 entities A and B have some sort of
disagreement between each other, while they both
also disagree about another entity C.
It shows that when candidates both disapproved on
one issue usually they still disapproved of each other,
therefore not creating any common ground. Hence,

there might be a substantial latent `convergence space'
on issues that is not expressed because of the competi-
tive nature of the campaign.
Table 6 shows the scores for Tb
and pT
for the total
number of cyclic triads found. Here we see that
33% < Tb < 79% while values for pT
remain low in
most cases other than the largest network. We see
that structural balance fails in cases where there is
less information in the networks (N 70) or there is
more noise (N ¼ 1047). Also we found that many
balanced cyclic triads were found in triad type 5 accord-
ing to Figure 14 with negative signs on mutual edges
and a positive sign on the remaining edge. An increased
number of this type had caused the improvement in
balance in the cyclic triads.
Table 7 shows Db
(fraction of balanced dyads) and
pD
scores for mutual dyads found in the network. pD
refers to the p value of the number of times that
Dr > Db
in 100 random networks. Dr
is the fraction of
balanced dyads in a random network.
It is interesting to see that 81% < Db < 100% while
pD
is 0 for all cases, indicating that they are significantly
balanced. We found that the dyad type most likely to
contribute to the balance was the dyad with two nega-
tive (À,À) links. Hence the network shows very high
balance in the dyad level.
From the experiments we can say that election net-
works do not show balance at the triad level while they
do at the cyclic level and dyad level. Triadic closure and
transitivity appears not to be characteristics of our

semantic graphs and this can be intuitively interpreted
as a less `coherent' set of signed ties. This intriguing
finding suggests that semantic graphs might be charac-
terised by a low level of `coherence' and the unbalanced
nature can be explained in the context of what the
semantic graphs represent. In the case of the represen-
tation of the US election, in the context of competition
among political actors, coherent positioning on issues
does not translate into a similar endorsement of other
actors that might share the same views. However, at the
dyad level, balance is present and especially in the nega-
tive form (À À), suggesting tested here is a great deal of
common ground regarding what is disapproved of that
binds the two parties and candidates.
A8 ­ Network partition method
The network should be partitioned into two classes
such that nodes in the same class are linked by positive
edges and nodes in different classes are linked by nega-
tive edges. The division of a network into two parts can
be a computationally expensive step, but the
optimisation problem can be relaxed, reducing to a
simple algebraic task by introducing the approximation
that the adjacency matrix of the network is symmetric
and positive definite, an assumption that can be readily
satisfied. We lose information at this stage by ignoring
the direction, but it is done only for the partitioning of
the network. For the rest of the analysis we use the
actual directed network.
Given a network with its adjacency matrix A, we
make it symmetric by adding it to its transpose result-
ing in matrix M ¼ A þ AT.
In matrix M where Mij 2 fÀ1, þ 1g we want to assign
each node to one of the two classes fÀ1, þ 1g as men-
tioned. This leads to the following optimisation problem.
argmax

We relax this problem (which is NP hard) by allow-
ing the membership function of each node to assume
values in <ð y 2 <Þ while keeping the norm of y fixed to
avoid trivial solutions.

y2<,jj yjj¼m

The problem now reduces to the following optimisa-
tion problem.
argmax
y
yTMy
yTy
This is equivalent to the eigenvalue problem,
My ¼ y by Rayleigh quotient (Horn and Johnson,
2012) since M is symmetric and positive definite by
construction, and therefore is efficiently solvable.
The real value assigned to each node in the eigen-
vector can be interpreted as the degree to which it
belongs to one of the two classes. Each eigenvector
corresponds to a possible bi-partitioning of the
graph, with the quality of the partition being repre-
sented by the corresponding eigenvalue. Therefore it
is natural to make use of the first eigenvector, possibly
looking at the second one when the eigenvalues are
very similar.

adjacency matrix, we can then analyse separately the
two resulting sub-networks, one relative to the
Obama camp and the other relative to the Romney
camp. In this section we will report the network cen-
trality and their interpretation in Obama's and
Romney's ideographs separately. The networks are
shown in the main text.
Obama's network. Table 9 presents the most prominent
object defined by a set of network metrics in the
Democratic part of the network. Let us consider four
main network metrics: degree, betweenness, closeness
centralities and authority.
Degree. Degree centrality indicates how prominent
an object is in the network by `brute force' of number of
incoming and outgoing links. As shown in Table 9, in
the case of the Democratic network, the highest degree
objects are: Obama, President (in this case acting as a
synonym for Obama), Clinton, Americans, Economy,
Campaign, etc. Several items are of particular interest
here: Economy, Plan, Rights, Proposals and GOP. The
economy was the most salient issue upon which the
campaign focused, with an indication of a clear plan
to recover the US economy. Hence, it is not surprising
that `economy' has a high degree centrality in the
Democrats' network. The presence of both `Plan' and
`Proposals' suggests the Obama campaign was focused
on presenting defined courses of action rather than
principles. This is in line with Conway et al. (2012)
who analysed Obama's strategy during the 2012 cam-
paign in terms of the complexity of its rhetoric.
Interestingly enough, the object `GOP' (Grand Old
Party) or the Republican Party is among those with
highest degree centrality.
Betweenness. The objects with the highest between-
ness centralities in the Democratic network were:
Obama, President, Campaign, Clinton, Americans,

Biden and speech. This is unsurprising because
Obama's policies and standpoints on a wide range of
different issues were the main link bringing about these
nodes. The same can be said about Campaign, Clinton
and Biden. The other bridging node is `speech', because
the links between issues were made in Obama's (and
Clinton's or Biden's) speeches. Thus the speech is the
`bridge' between the different issues in the sense
that they bring the issues together. The other interesting
item is `Americans'. This is the object that Obama's
campaign used as the noun for American citizens. It
marks the difference with Romney's high betweenness
item `People' (as we will see in the next Section), which
has a Republican connotation.
In-closeness. Table 9 reports `in-closeness' centrality.
Considering the objects with the highest in-closeness cen-
trality in Obama's network, we find objects such as:
`Campaign', `Law', `Redistribution', `Pledge', `Ads',
`Overhaul', `Biden', `Investments', etc. These objects are
a mixture of policy and economic tools (law, redistribu-
tion, overhaul of a policy, investments) and contexts
(Campaign, Ads, Pledge). The vice-president Biden can
also be considered as a context in the sense of being the
context of a given Obama statement. This centrality mea-
sure gives an idea of the Democrats' domains of state-
ments that can be compared to the Republicans'.
Authority. As discussed previously, identifying
objects with high authority can help us to define the
agenda-setting efforts of each of the two parties.
Using Table 9 to navigate the objects with the highest
authority in the Democratic network, we can find:
Obama/President, Economy, Plan, Rights, Proposals,
Efforts, Biden/Vice-President, Speech, Remarks,
Election, Policies, Campaign and Debbie Stabenow.
The latter refers to the Democratic Senate candidate
in Michigan and the related Republican `Asian Ad',
an unfortunate television advert for the Republican
candidate Peter Hoekstra. Beside the expected presence
of Obama and Biden, the other objects are indicative
of a campaign strongly focused on the economy and on
actions and tools (plan, proposals, efforts, policies)
combined with an emphasis on rights. In the above
discussion about issue ownership during US presiden-
tial campaigns, the latter topic has traditionally been a
Democrat theme. It appears that the 2012 campaign
was very much focused on the `Economy' and
`Rights' for the Democrats, and the agenda-setting
effort was directed towards these two issues.
Mitt Romney's network. Table 10 presents the most pro-
minent objects defined by a set of network metrics in
the GOP of the network. Let us consider four main
network metrics: degree, betweenness, closeness cen-
tralities and authority.
Degree centrality. The top two objects in terms of
degree centrality in the Republican network are
obviously related to the presidential `ticket': Mitt
Romney and Paul Ryan. The two main actors of the
Republican campaign are followed by two nouns:
people and plans. We have mentioned earlier the his-
torical and symbolic importance of this term of the
GOP. It is, therefore, unsurprising that it is among
the objects with a very high degree in the network of
Table 10. Network centrality measures for the Republicans' sub-network.

claims. Another object with high degree centrality is
`Plans', which refers to the Republican initiative of pre-
scriptions for the US economy.
`Voters' and `Supporters' also have a high degree
centrality as they constitute the main targets of the
campaign. The other target of many Republican state-
ments was the object `People' (we have previously dis-
cussed the symbolic value of this term in the
Republican political vocabulary).
There are, however, two objects that are related to
controversies and attacks from the Democrats. The first
is `Mourdock'. This refers to the controversial public
statement on abortion and rape made by the
Republican senator Richard Mourdock.5
The second issue related to an `attack' from
Obama's campaign is the object `Bill'. It refers to the
Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan
`blocking' a farm bill that Obama claimed would `pro-
vide relief and certainty to US farmers and ranchers'
during the worst drought in more than 50 years.
Another interesting object with high degree centrality
is `Israel'. Candidate Romney travelled to Israel during
the campaign and expressed his strong support for the
Israeli state and his policy in the Middle East. This
topic generated a substantial amount of discussion in
the media.
Betweenness. In the case of the Republican network,
the objects with high betweenness centralities are all
actors: `Romney', `Ryan', `People' and `Republicans'.
Also in the case of the Democratic network, actors were
the most bridging objects, but it appears that for
Republicans there are the two candidates ­ Romney
and Ryan ­ and then the `People' or the GOP. By
comparison, in Obama's network there is the presence
of Bill Clinton in addition to Joe Biden, there are the
`Americans' rather than `People', and there is no party
but rather Obama's `speeches'.
In-closeness. As discussed in the case of the
Democrats' network, these are objects that in virtue
of their high in-closeness centrality are related to con-
text as `qualifiers'. In the Republican network, we find
objects such as: `Amendment', `Work', `Proposal' and
`Breaks'. Some of these objects have been explained
before, but to summarise: `Amendment' refers to the
amendment to the federal marriage law to allow
same-sex marriage; `Work' refers to the work require-
ments necessary to receive welfare benefits; `Breaks' is
related to tax breaks and `proposal' to the Republican
anti-recession economic policies; `Bill' to Obama's
attack on Paul Ryan about the Farms Bill. Another
relevant object is `PBS', which refers to Romney's com-
ments on public broadcasting framed by the `Sesame
Street' comment.6 What is evident is that some of the
objects with high in-closeness centrality come from the
Republican campaigns but others are forced upon
them.
Authority. As mentioned before, authority centrality
represents a proxy of agenda-setting efforts. In this
respect, the objects with the highest authority centrality
in the Republican network have been already encoun-
tered in the above description. Not surprisingly, the
highest object in terms of authority is `Romney'. This
is followed by `Plans', `People', `Decision' and
`Proposal', all of which are keywords of Romney's cam-
paign and language. However, there are three objects
indicating a reaction rather than an initiative in terms
of agenda setting: `Mourdock', `Bill' and `Public
Broadcasting'. As discussed above, all three objects
are related to attacks from Obama's campaign.
`Israel' is also present among the objects with high
authority and it refers to Romney's speech in Israel,
about US Middle East foreign policy.
The remaining objects with high authority are what
now appear to be important issues in the 2012
Republican campaign: tax breaks (Breaks), the amend-
ment to the federal marriage law (Amendment), the
work requirements for welfare benefits (Work).
