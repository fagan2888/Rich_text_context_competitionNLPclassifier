Background
More than 40% of treated hypertensives in the United States do
not have their blood pressure under control.This is partly owing to
non-persistence with prescribed medication, which occurs within
1 year in 32­53% of newly treated patients. Knowledge of factors
related to non-persistence is limited, partly because previous studies
have being conducted mostly in elderly patients enrolled in a single
health insurance.
Methods
Weighted logistic regression was used to identify factors associated
with non-persistence in hypertensive patients from National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys III (NHANES III) and NHANES
1999­2002 who had been prescribed antihypertensive medication.
Results
Of 6100 participants, 903 were non-persistent (sampling weighted
national prevalence of 12.5%), even though they had elevated blood
pressure. Non-persistence was 12 times higher in patients <30 years
than in those 50 years old (P < 0.001), 31% higher in men than in
women (P = 0.01), and 43% higher in Hispanics, as compare to other
racial groups (P = 0.03). Patients with low income were almost two
times more likely to be non-persistent (P < 0.001). Having no health
insurance increased non-persistence by 88% (P = 0.002), and patients
who did not visit their doctor during the last year were 10 times more
likely to be non-persistent than those who made at least one medical
visit (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
In addition to young age, factors related to access to health care and
medications (low income, health insurance, and visits to the doctor)
were the main predictors of non-persistence. Policies that improve
access to health care and patient follow-up may be of great impact in
maintaining persistence.

Long-term control of elevated arterial pressure results in large
reductions in morbidity and mortality attributable to hyperten-
sion.1 However, only 57% of known hypertensive patients receiv-
ing pharmacologic treatment in the United States have their
blood pressure controlled.2 It is estimated that 15% of all cases
of acute myocardial infarction3 and 32% of all strokes4 among
subjects treated for hypertension can be attributed to uncon-
trolled blood pressure. Failure by patients to use medications as
prescribed is considered a major contributor to poor control of
hypertension and lessens the effectiveness of antihypertensive
drugs in preventing stroke, coronary heart disease, and chronic
kidney disease.5 In fact, simulation studies suggest that improv-
ing compliance with existing antihypertensive medication could
be more beneficial than using an ideal antihypertensive drug,
i.e., a drug that makes the quality-adjusted life expectancy of a
hypertensive person similar to that of a non-hypertensive.6
Non-adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medication is
highly prevalent. Patients may either modify or miss medication
doses in the context of ongoing use (non-compliance) or may
prematurely discontinue therapy completely (non-persistence).7
Pharmacy claims data have been frequently used to estimate
compliance as the ratio of total days of medication supplied to
total days in a period of time (medication possession ratio).7 In
a recent study among new hypertensive patients enrolled in a
single health insurance plan, Grant et al. found a 35% cumula-
tive non-compliance (medication possession ratio <80%) over
an average follow-up of 40 months.8 Similarly, in a large study
among patients from the Department of Veteran's Affairs com-
pliance rates ranged from 78 to 84% over 12 months.9 Pharmacy
claims databases have also been used to identify patients who
stop filling out their prescription medication for a predefined
period of time (non-persistent). Recent studies using this
approach have shown that 32­53% of newly treated hyperten-
sives stop using their medication by the end of the first year of
treatment.10,11
Several factors have been associated with antihypertensive
treatment non-compliance and non-persistence. However,
results from previous studies of non-adherence are of limited
generalizability because they have been conducted mostly
among middle-aged and elderly patients enrolled in a single
health insurance.9,10,12,13 Also, these studies have provided lit-
tle information on the effects of enabling factors such as health
insurance, income, and use of health services, since all partici-
pants were insured and received total or partial reimbursement

for prescribed medications.9,12,14 Moreover, findings from pre-
vious studies12,13 may not apply to current practice, since the
pattern of medication prescription and use has likely changed
during the last decade as a consequence of increasing aware-
ness of the benefits of blood pressure reduction, new practice
guidelines, and availability of newer drugs with less undesirable
side effects.15,16 This study used data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) to evaluate the
role of factors that describe the propensity of patients to comply
with treatment recommendations (predisposing factors); factors
that comprise the resources available to help patients in obtain-
ing health care and medications (enabling factors); and factors
that reflect the patients' requirements for care and medication
(need characteristics).17
Methods
Analyses in this article are based on data from NHANES III
(1988­1994),18 NHANES 1999­2000, and NHANES 2001­
2002.19 NHANES III was conducted in two phases, from 1988
to1991 and from 1991 to 1994. The most recent NHANES
have a similar design but are conducted in yearly waves. Also,
a unique set of weights is available for combining the data from
NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­2002. The sample for NHANES
is selected through a complex multistage design based on pri-
mary sampling units (counties), household segments within
the counties, and finally, sampled persons from selected house-
holds. This design is aimed to obtain a representative sample
of the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the United
States. African Americans, Mexican Americans, people of age
12­19 and >60-years, low-income whites, and pregnant women
are oversampled to obtain precise estimates in these groups.
NHANES participants provided informed consent and the data
collection procedures are approved by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Institutional Review Board as ensuring
confidentiality.
This analysis includes NHANES participants who reported they
had been diagnosed with hypertension and advised by their phy-
sicians to use antihypertensive medication (n = 6,733). Trained
NHANES interviewers verified the medications being used during
the 30 days prior to the survey date by direct inspection of medi-
cation containers. Individuals who did not use antihypertensive
medication during that period were classified as non-persistent.
A group of 571 participants who were not taking antihypertensive
medication and had normal blood pressure during the physical
exam (systolic blood pressure <140 and diastolic blood pressure
<90mmHg) was excluded. These participants were likely normo-
tensives or hypertensives who had their blood pressure control-
led by non-pharmacologic therapy. They would have been falsely
classified as cases of non-persistence, and their inclusion would
have biased the observed associations towards the null. Pregnant
women (n = 14) and subjects without medication use data were
also excluded (n = 48). The analysis was aimed at identifying the
independent effect of predisposing factors (age, gender, ethnicity,
education, marital status, language, alcohol intake, and smoking),
enabling factors (average family annual income, having health
insurance, and visits to the doctor during the last year), and need

characteristics (body mass index, self-reported health status, and
coexisting chronic disease). People with a history of diseases that
require regular and persistent use of medications were classified
as having a chronic disease. This included people with a history of
arthritis, stroke, emphysema, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, diabetes,
or acute myocardial infarction.
All analyses were statistically weighted to maintain the repre-
sentativeness of the sample for the US population, to avoid selec-
tion bias, and to correctly estimate the precision of regression
coefficients. NHANES mobile examination center-examined
sample weight values were used to adjust for the differential prob
abilities of selection and non-response in the survey sample.19,20
A new set of analytical weights was calculated and used in the
analysis to account for the fact that data came from two inde-
pendent surveys (NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000 plus
NHANES 2001­2002). The new set of sampling weights was
calculated as a weighted average of the original weights, fol-
lowing the recommendation of Korn and Graubard.21 This
approach yields unbiased and efficient estimation of popula-
tion parameters. Although sampling weights account for non-
participation, they do not account for the exclusion of subjects
that results from missing data on one or more variables included
in the analysis. If subjects with missing data are excluded, the
sum of the weights for the remaining subjects will not equal the
population size and selection bias could occur.22 To avoid this
bias, multivariate imputation by chained equations was used to
fill out missing values and to generate 10 imputed data sets.23
Each completed data set was analyzed independently and the
parameters of interest were averaged across the 10 copies, using
Rubin's formula,24 to obtain a single estimate. Multiple logis-
tic regression with sampling weights was used to estimate the
independent effect of each factor on non-persistence. The first
imputed data set was used for model building and variable selec-
tion and the resulting model was applied to the remaining data
sets before averaging the estimates.22 The excess fraction (attrib-
utable risk), i.e., the proportion of non-persistent cases in the
population that could be reasonably associated to each factor,
was used to summarize the impact of enabling factors on non-
persistence. The excess fraction was calculated as the proportion
of exposed cases times (odds ratio (OR)-1/OR).25 All analyses
were conducted adjusting for the complex survey design using
Stata 9.0 (StataCorp. 2005, College Station, TX).
Results
This study includes 6,100 subjects who reported that they have
been advised to take antihypertensive medication, 61.2% from
NHANES III, 18.4% from NHANES 1999­2000, and the rest
from NHANES 2001­2002. A total of 903 individuals were not
taking antihypertensive medication, corresponding to a sam-
pling weighted national prevalence of non-persistence of 12.5%
(95% confidence interval--CI: 10.9, 14.4); 15.6% (12.8, 18.8) in
NHANES III, and 10.4% (8.8, 12.2) in recent NHANES. Mean
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 139 and 76mmHg,
respectively, in patients who were taking their antihypertensive
medication and 150 and 86mmHg in those who were not (P <
0.001 for both comparisons). The average age was 61 years, 42%

were men, 76% were White, and 33% had a less than high school
education (Table 1). Smoking and alcohol intake were consid-
erably higher in non-persistent patients. Lack of health insur-
ance and not visiting the doctor during the last year were also
higher among subjects who were not taking 
antihypertensive

medications (Table 2). Also, a significant fraction (66%) reported
suffering from at least one chronic disease with non-persistence
cases being more likely to have a chronic disease.
The crude analysis showed that non-persistence increased
dramatically with younger age and with subjects <30 being

more than 10 times more likely to be non-persistent than those
50 years old (Table 3). Participants 50 years old were used as
the reference group because the prevalence of non-
persistence
was homogeneous and the lowest in this age group. Men,
African Americans, Hispanics, and those who were divorced
were significantly more likely to be non-persistent. Also, non-
persistence prevalence was significantly higher among smokers
and individuals who had 2 alcohol drinks/day. Individuals with
average family income <$55,000/year were twice as likely to be
non-persistent (Table 4). However, the larger crude increases in
the frequency of non-persistence occurred in people who did
not visit a physician during the last year (OR: 11.86; P < 0.001)
and those without health insurance (OR: 3.15; P < 0.001). On
the contrary, individuals who were suffering from some form of
chronic disease were significantly less likely to be non-persistent
(OR: 0.59; P = 0.006).
The results from the multivariate analysis showed that age,
gender, and race were the only predisposing factors independ-
ently associated to non-persistence with antihypertensive medi-
cation. After adjustment for other risk factors, non-persistence
increased about 2.5 times in people 40­49 and 30­39 years
old (P < 0.001) and over 12 times in those <30 years old (P <
0.001), as compared to patients 50 years old (Table 5). Also,
non-
persistence was 31% more likely in men than in women
(P = 0.011) and 43% more likely in Hispanics than in other
ethnic groups (P = 0.027). All studied enabling factors were

independently and significantly associated with non-persistence
(Table 5). Low-income patients were 1.96 times more likely to
be non-persistent than those with a family average income
$50,000/year (P < 0.001). Similarly, non-persistence was 1.88
times more frequent among patients without health insurance
(P = 0.002). However, visiting the doctor during the last year was
the enabling factor with the strongest effect on non-persistence.
Patients who did not seek medical attention during the last year
were over 10 times more likely to be non-persistent than those
who made at least one medical visit (P < 0.001). After adjust-
ment for other factors, none of the need factors studied (body
mass index, self-reported health status, and coexisting chronic
disease) was significantly associated to non-persistence. On the
other hand, the prevalence of non-persistence decreased by 27%
between 1988­1994 and 1999­2002 (P = 0.019).
The fraction of cases of non-persistence that could theoretically
be prevented by eliminating the exposure (excess fraction) was

41.3% (95% CI: 28.8, 51.6) for low income, 17.5% (95% CI: 17.5,
17.6) for not visiting the doctor, and 6.9% (95% CI: 6.7, 7.2) for
not having health insurance. Overall, having any of these three
risk factors increased non-persistence 2.56 times and accounted
for an excess of 53.1% of all cases (95% CI: 42.6, 61.6).
Discussion
Despite significant advances in detection, treatment, and con-
trol of high blood pressure,2 essential hypertension remains the
second major contributor to the current burden of morbidity
and mortality in developed countries and developing countries
with low mortality.26 Poor medication-taking behavior is a
major determinant of uncontrolled blood pressure, a condition
that occurs in over 40% of treated hypertensives in the United
States.2
This study shows that 12.5% of hypertensive patients advised
to take blood pressure lowering medication are not taking it,
even though they still have elevated blood pressure. Age was
the stronger predictor of non-persistence in this study, with
subjects <30 being 12 times more likely to be non-persistent
than those 50 years old, independent of other risk factors.
The observed age effect was of the same direction but stronger
than the effect reported in previous studies.10,27 The stronger
age effect observed in this study is probably a consequence of
including subjects from a wider age range than those included
in previous studies.10,27
Prevalence of non-persistence was 31% higher in men than
in women. Previous studies have shown that non-persistence is
8­12% more frequent among men but have failed to adjust for
other predisposing and enabling factors.10,27 Although crude
non-persistence prevalence was significantly higher in African
Americans and Hispanics, the adjusted analysis showed no
relative increase in African Americans and a significant 43%
increase in Hispanics, as compared to other racial groups. An
effect of race on treatment persistence has not been previously
reported, but several studies have shown an increased risk of
non-compliance among African Americans, as compared to
whites.9,13,14 Unfortunately, those studies have included few or
no Hispanics and have not taken into account important con-
founders. An increased non-persistence in Hispanics could be
partly explained by communication difficulties owing to lin-
guistic barriers and poor understanding between patient and
physician. Unfortunately, no data on the language spoken by
the treating physician were available.
Although financial problems are commonly cited as a barrier
to hypertensive care,28 most studies of antihypertensive treat-
ment adherence have been conducted in insured populations
with total or partial reimbursement for prescribed medications,
limiting the opportunity to assess the role of enabling factors such
as income, health insurance, and use of health services.9,10,13,27
Results from this analysis indicate that patient with an average
family income below $50,000/year were almost two times more
likely to be non-persistent than those with higher income. Low
income has been associated to lower frequency of hypertension
screening but did not seem to influence pharmacologic treatment
or patient follow-up.28 Lack of health insurance was associated
with an 88% increase in the risk of non-persistence in the present
study. This finding is consistent with poorer follow-up of treated
hypertensives without health insurance reported in a previous
study.28 An important finding of the present study was that
patients who did not visit their 
doctor during the year 
preceding
the interview were 10 times more likely to be non-
persistent than
those who made at least one medical visit. In a large population
study, Perreault et al. found that a greater number of 
medical
visits had no significant effect, whereas 
hospitalization had a
significant positive impact on persistence.10 Also, Caro et al.
has reported significantly increased persistence in hypertensive
patients who visited the doctor five or more times during the
last year.27 Consistent results have also been observed in studies
of compliance.13,14 These results suggest that factors that help
patients to obtain medication and health care could significantly
improve treatment persistence.
Several limitations must be considered in interpreting these
results. First, this analysis is based on a cross-sectional sample
that includes only those hypertensive patients who survived up
to the time of the interview. Since survival should be higher for
patients who remain under treatment, the results of this analy-
sis may be different from those from a cohort study. However,
findings from this analysis are still useful to identify poten-
tial determinants of persistence and high-risk groups. Second,
there was no way to verify whether the doctor had actually
prescribed antihypertensive medication. However, Klungel
et al.29 compared self-reported antihypertensive drug use and
pharmacy records and found that the accuracy of self-report
was considerably high (sensitivity of 94.2% and specificity of
96.3%). Therefore, this source of error should have a negligible
impact on the results of the present study. Third, non-persistent
patients in this study are a mix of those who never started treat-
ment and those who stopped taking their medication for at
least 1 month. Whether the observed associations are different
for one group and the other cannot be ascertained with the
data at hand. Finally, the type of antihypertensive medication
prescribed to non-persistent patients is not known. This may
be of relevance, since the type of antihypertensive drug influ-
ences persistence and is related to factors such as age, gender,
and comorbidities.10,30
To my knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to measure
simultaneously the independent effect of patient's predisposing,
enabling, and need characteristics on persistence with antihy-
pertensive medication. The main strength of this study is the
use of data from NHANES. Since NHANES provide nation-
ally representative samples, the findings from this analysis are
unlikely affected by selection bias and can be extrapolated to
the US population. This study, in particular, overcomes the
limitations of previous studies that mostly comprised elderly
people enrolled in a health insurance plan, with less than ideal
representation of ethnic minorities. Another strength of the
present analysis study was the availability of high quality data
for the definition of the target population and the ascertain-
ment of persistence status. Specifically, hypertensive status was
determined by interview and blood pressure measurements,
and trained interviewers verified the medications being used

by direct inspection of medication containers. Finally, I was able
to account for the effect of multiple characteristics that influence
the use of antihypertensive medication, beyond those regularly
available in pharmacy claims databases.
In summary, non-persistence with antihypertensive medica-
tion increased significantly with young age, in men, and among
Hispanics. Non-persistence was also considerably increased in
populations with financial barriers to the availability of health
care. In fact, low income, having no health insurance, and not
visiting the doctor during the last year accounted for more than
50% of the cases of non-persistence. Policies that improve access
to health care and patient follow-up may be of great importance
in maintaining long-term persistence with antihypertensive
medication.
