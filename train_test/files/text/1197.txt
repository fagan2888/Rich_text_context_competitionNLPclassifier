ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Although the effects of nutrition on health and school performance
are often cited, few research studies have examined the effect of diet quality on the
academic performance of children. This study examines the association between over-
all diet quality and academic performance.
METHODS: In 2003, 5200 grade 5 students in Nova Scotia, Canada, and their pa-
rents were surveyed as part of the Children's Lifestyle and School-performance Study.
Information on dietary intake, height, and weight and sociodemographic variables
were linked to results of a provincial standardized literacy assessment. Diet Quality
Index--International was used to summarize overall diet quality. Multilevel regression
methods were used to examine the association between indicators of diet quality and
academic performance while adjusting for gender and socioeconomic characteristics
of parents and residential neighborhoods.
RESULTS: Across various indicators of diet quality, an association with academic perfor-
mance was observed. Students with decreased overall diet quality were significantly more
likely to perform poorly on the assessment. Girls performed better than boys as did chil-
dren from socioeconomically advantaged families. Children attending better schools and
living in wealthy neighborhoods also performed better.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an association between diet quality
and academic performance and identify specific dietary factors that contribute to this
association. Additionally, this research supports the broader implementation and
investment in effective school nutrition programs that have the potential to improve
student access to healthy food choices, diet quality, academic performance, and, over
the long term, health.

LITERATURE REVIEW
The academic performance of children impacts
their future educational attainment and health and
has therefore emerged as a public health concern.1
Generally, as levels of education increase, there is an
associated increase in income and social status.2 This
associated increase in socioeconomic status affects
health by influencing access to health care, quality of
housing, work environment, lifestyle factors, such as
nutrition and recreation, and social psychological fac-
tors, such as self-esteem and health awareness.3 Given
the demonstrated importance of academic perfor-
mance and resulting educational attainment to future
health, it is imperative to understand the determinants
of school performance. A number of factors are re-
cognized as affecting school performance including
gender, ethnicity, quality of school and school experi-
ence, nutrition, child health, and socioeconomic fac-
tors.4 This paper focuses on the importance of
nutrition, specifically overall diet quality, to academic
performance.
In past decades, poor diet, characterized by excess
intake of dietary fat and refined sugars and inade-
quate intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains,
has been identified as one of the primary mecha-
nisms underlying the rising prevalence of overweight
and obesity in school-age children.5,6 The prevalence
of childhood overweight and obesity is particularly
high in North America and more specifically in the
province of Nova Scotia where the prevalence of child-
hood overweight is significantly higher than the
national average.7-9 Examination of the prevalence
of overweight among grade 5 students in Nova Scotia
indicates that 32.9% of students were at risk for over-
weight, with 9.9% being overweight.10 The diminish-
ing diet quality and increasing body weights among
children draw renewed public health attention to the
effects of diet on academic performance and future
health.
The relationship between diet and academic perfor-
mance is often stated; however, few studies have
examined the effects of diet quality on academic per-
formance. Studies of nutrition and academic perfor-
mance have typically focused on hunger, malnutrition,
and micronutrient deficiency.11-13 Undernourished
children have been shown to have decreased atten-
dance, attention, and academic performance as well
as experience more health problems compared to
well-nourished children.11,14 More recently, studies
have examined the impact of breakfast on cognition,
behavior, and academic performance of school-age
children.11,15-17 This research suggests some positive
effect of breakfast on performance of specific cognitive
tasks.11,16,17 However, gaps exist in the literature exam-
ining the long-term effects of breakfast on school per-
formance and how the observed effects of breakfast
on cognition are modified by age, sex, and nutritional
status.11,17 The single study not restricted to breakfast
demonstrated a positive association between the con-
sumption of regular meals and school performance.18
The predominant approach to studying diet has
focused on the role of individual nutrients or foods.19
However, individuals do not consume single nutrients
but combinations of foods.20 In recognition of the mul-
tidimensional nature of diet, studies of the interrela-
tions of nutrition and health have examined the
effects of overall diet quality using summary measures
of food and nutrient intake.20,21 The current study em-
ploys such an approach to investigate the association
between diet quality and academic performance in
a sample of 5200 grade 5 students in the province of
Nova Scotia, Canada.
METHODS
Subjects
The 2003 Children's Lifestyle and School-perfor-
mance Study (CLASS) is a large study of health, nutri-
tion, physical activity, school performance, and
socioeconomic determinants among grade 5 students
in Nova Scotia, Canada, where 98.4% of students
attend public school.22 Of the 291 Nova Scotia public
schools with grade 5 classes, 282 (96.9%) participated
in the recruitment of participants by distributing a con-
sent form and short survey to parents. Parental consent
was received for 5517 students, giving an average
response rate of 51.1% per school. Trained CLASS rep-
resentatives visited participating schools during school
hours to administer a survey on children's activities and
a modified version of the Harvard Youth/Adolescent
Food Frequency Questionnaire (YAQ).23 Height and
weight of participating students were also measured
by CLASS representatives in a discreet manner behind
a mobile screen in student classrooms. Height was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 cm after students had removed
their shoes and body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg on
calibrated digital scales. Generally, the administra-
tion of the surveys and measurement of heights and
weights took less than 45 minutes to complete. Further
details on the conduct of the CLASS are provided
elsewhere.10,24,25
Ethics Approval. This study, including the
informed consent procedure, was approved by the
Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Board of Dal-
housie University. Informed consent was obtained
from parents before the participation of their children.
Instruments
Assessment of Diet Quality. The YAQ is a validated
food frequency questionnaire suitable for grade 5
students. Information obtained from the YAQ
allows calculation of student's intake of foods from
210 d Journal of School Health d April 2008, Vol. 78, No. 4 d ª 2008, American School Health Association
recommended food groups as well as energy and
nutrient intakes. On the basis of the latter, we calcu-
lated the Diet Quality Index--International (DQI-I),
a composite measure of diet quality.26 A composite
measure of diet quality is preferable to multiple analy-
ses of nutrients and food groups.20,21 The DQI-I overall
score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat-
ing better diet quality. Further information on the
development, validation, and scoring of the DQI-I is
available elsewhere.21,26,27
The DQI-I has been demonstrated as an effective
means of cross-national comparisons of diet quality.26
However, it has been suggested that DQI-I scoring is
more in line with US recommendations, and therefore,
DQI-I interpretations should be carefully interpreted in
other countries where dietary recommendations are
based on existing food patterns that are different from
those in the United States.28 In order to provide a com-
parative measure of overall diet quality, the Healthy
Eating Index (HEI), an alternative measure of diet qual-
ity, was also calculated based on YAQ responses.29
In addition to examining the association between
overall diet quality and academic performance, it is
also valuable to determine which specific aspects of
diet quality are most important to academic per-
formance. The DQI-I was chosen as it encompasses
adequacy, variety, balance, and moderation as com-
ponents of diet quality and provides a score for each.26
The association between each of these DQI-I compo-
nent scores and academic performance was examined
independently. The dietary adequacy component ofthe
DQI-I represents the intake of foods and nutrients
essential to a healthy diet such as fruits, vegetables,
grains, dietary fiber, protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin
C. Intake of less healthful dietary components such as
saturated fat, salt, and ``empty calorie foods'' is reflected
in the DQI-I moderation score. The DQI-I variety score
reflects the diversity of foods in the diet, whereas over-
all dietary balance, in terms of the proportion of energy
intake from carbohydrate, fat, and protein, is indicated
by the DQI-I balance score.26
Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and
moderate fat intake are considered as indicative of
high-quality diet and are emphasized as part of the
total diet approach to improving nutrition among
children.5,20 In order to determine their specific associ-
ations with academic performance, the number of serv-
ings of fruits and vegetables and percentage of caloric
intake from dietary fat were examined independently.
With the exception of DQI-I balance component score,
which had a skewed distribution, diet quality indicators
were considered as tertiles.
Assessment of Academic Performance. The Ele-
mentary Literacy Assessment is a standardized test
administered by the Nova Scotia Department of Edu-
cation in the fall of 2003. The assessment was admin-
istered approximately 6 months following the CLASS
survey when participating students were enrolled in
grade 6. Completion of the assessment required stu-
dents to read a variety of materials and answer writ-
ten questions based on those readings. Materials
included a short story, information texts, a poem,
and a visual media text. Reading and writing assess-
ments were marked centrally by a team of experi-
enced grade 6 teachers under the supervision of the
Nova Scotia Department of Education. Both individual-
and school-level test results were linked to the CLASS
database and were considered in the present study.
Data available from the Nova Scotia Department of
Education included individual results as a dichoto-
mous outcome (pass/fail) for both the reading and the
writing assessments. At the student level, academic
performance was treated as a dichotomous variable
with good academic performance defined as passing
both the reading and the writing assessments and
poor academic performance as failing either the read-
ing or the writing assessment or both. Of the 4966
grade 5 students remaining after exclusion for outly-
ing observations for energy intake, 4589 (92.4%)
were successfully linked with the Elementary Literacy
Assessment. At the school level, the percentage of
students passing both assessments was a marker of
performance.
Assessment of Other Covariates. At risk for over-
weight and its more severe form, overweight, were
defined using the international body mass index cut-
off points established for children and youth by the
World Health Organization's International Obesity
Task Force.30 The Nova Scotia public school system is
administered through 7 school boards, 1 of which did
not allow height and weight measurements to be taken.
For the 816 students without these measurements,
weight status was considered as a missing category. So-
ciodemographic factors including student gender,
urban or rural residency, parental marital status, edu-
cation, and income were assessed using the question-
naire completed by parents of the participating
students. Age was not considered as a covariate as the
vast majority of grade 5 students were either 10 or 11
years old at the time they completed the CLASS survey.
School neighborhood income was estimated by averag-
ing postal code­level estimates of household income,
available through Census Canada, of students attend-
ing that particular school. School neighborhood aver-
age income was divided into tertiles for analysis.
Data Analysis
Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine
the associations between indicators of diet quality and
academic performance. Multilevel methods account
for the clustering of student's observations within
schools and allow for quantification of second-level
factors such as neighborhood income and school-level

academic performance. Gender of the student and
parental marital status, income, and educational
attainment were considered as first-level covariates.
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are pre-
sented for all analyses. Missing values for all covari-
ates were considered as separate categories, but their
estimates are not presented here.
Of the 5517 children who received parental con-
sent, 5200 completed the YAQ. We excluded 234
(4.5%) students with outlying observations based on
energy intakes less than 500 kcal or greater than 5000
kcal/day in accordance with established recommenda-
tions for outliers in nutritional research.31 Following
established recommendations, all analyses involving
dietary factors were adjusted for energy intake.31
Examination of cross-level interactions revealed no
significant effects. All analyses were performed using
the HLM6 (Scientific Software International, Inc.,
Lincolnwood, IL) software program.
Response Weights. Evaluation of nonresponse was
conducted using postal code­level estimates of house-
hold income available through Census Canada for
participating and nonparticipating grade 5 students.
As participation rates were slightly lower in residen-
tial areas with lower postal code­level estimates of
average household income, weighting factors were
constructed to adjust for this difference. These weight-
ing factors were used in all statistical analyses in or-
der to adjust for nonresponse and provide provincial
estimates.
RESULTS
Information on the sociodemographic characteris-
tics of study participants is presented in Table 1. Of
the 4589 students with complete information on diet
quality and school performance, 875 (19.1%) failed 1
or both of the components of the literacy assessment.
Table 2 presents unadjusted results for DQI and other
dietary indicators on school performance. The overall
diet quality scores ranged from 26.0 to 86.0, with an
average score of 62.4. Students reporting increased
diet quality were significantly less likely to fail the lit-
eracy assessment. Relative to students in the lowest
DQI-I tertile, students in the second and third tertiles
were 26% and 41% less likely to fail. Variety and ade-
quacy rather than moderation and balance were the
DQI-I components most significantly associated with
academic performance. Students with an increased
fruit and vegetable intake and lower caloric intake of
fat were significantly less likely to fail the assessment.
Analysis of HEI, an alternative summary measure of
diet quality, yielded results similar to the association
between DQI-I and academic performance.
Relative to girls, boys were twice as likely to fail
their literacy assessments (Table 3). Increased paren-
tal income and educational attainment were sig-
nificantly associated with decreased odds of poor
academic performance. Parental marital status was
also associated with academic performance: those
children living in a lone-parent household had
increased odds of failing 1 or both assessments. Stu-
dents attending school in an urban area were signifi-
cantly less likely to fail than those living in rural
areas. Additionally, school neighborhood income was
found to be significantly associated with academic
performance. Children living in neighborhoods with
increased average income levels were less likely to fail
1 or both assessments. Meanwhile, children attending
schools with a poorer average performance on the lit-
eracy assessment had significantly increased odds of
failing the assessment.
Adjusting for differences with respect to gender,
parental income and education, and school, students
in the second and third DQI-I tertiles were, respec-
tively, 18% and 30% less likely to fail the literacy
assessment (Table 3). Parental education and income
remained significantly associated with students'
academic performance. Overall school performance
continued to be strongly associated with student's
academic performance. Urban or rural residence,
weight status, and marital status of parents were not
independently associated with academic performance
after adjustment.

DISCUSSION
These findings demonstrate an independent associ-
ation between overall diet quality and academic per-
formance among grade 5 students in Nova Scotia,
Canada. Dietary adequacy and variety were identified
as specific aspects of diet quality important to aca-
demic performance, thereby highlighting the value of
consuming a diverse selection of foods in order to
meet the recommended number of servings from each
food group. Additionally, fruit and vegetable con-
sumption and dietary fat intake, 2 critical nutritional
concerns among children,5 were demonstrated as
important to academic performance. The contribution
of diet to academic performance is frequently stated;
however, the focus of much of the research has been
on hunger, malnutrition, micronutrient deficiency,
and the effects of breakfast on cognition. In separate
reviews, Taras and Rampersaud conclude that the pro-
vision of a healthy breakfast through school breakfast
programs is effective in improving cognitive function-
ing and academic performance, especially among
undernourished populations.11,16 This study extends
current knowledge in this area by demonstrating the
independent importance of overall diet quality to aca-
demic performance and by identifying specific dietary
factorsthat contribute to the association between nutri-
tion and academic performance. The consistency of this
association across various indicators of diet quality
gives emphasis to the importance of children's nutri-
tion not only at breakfast but also throughout the day.
Academic performance influences future educa-
tional attainment and income, which, in turn, affect

health and quality of life.2 The socioeconomic benefits
of educational attainment carry forward to future gen-
erations as children from socioeconomically advan-
taged backgrounds are more likely to succeed in
school. Moreover, as increased levels of educational
attainment and income facilitate increased under-
standing of nutrition messages and access to healthy
food,24,32,33 children from socioeconomically advan-
taged families are more likely to consume healthy diets.
Increased diet quality among these children will pro-
vide further benefit to their academic performance and,
in terms of health, contribute to healthy child develop-
ment, which influences health throughout the life
course. In addition, healthy eating behaviors adopted
in childhood are likely to continue through adoles-
cence and adulthood and result in decreased risk of
chronic diseases.34 Alternatively, children from socio-
economically disadvantaged backgrounds are more
likely to have poor diets and poor academic perfor-
mance resulting in lower levels of educational attain-
ment and poorer health outcomes. Over time, the
cyclical and compounded effects of socioeconomic fac-
tors and diet quality on academic performance may
contribute to future increases in socioeconomic dispar-
ities in health. This research supports previous research
demonstrating that academic performance varies ac-
cording to the student's gender and that male students
are more likely to perform poorly in terms of literacy.4
This relationship has been observed as steady across
different levels of socioeconomic status.4
In light of the current childhood overweight epi-
demic and underlying poor dietary habits, prevention
is a public health priority. Our findings suggest
enhanced learning as an additional benefit of a
healthy diet in childhood. In a review of overweight and
student school performance, Taras and Potts-Datema
note the consistency of the association between child-
hood overweight and poorer levels of academic
achievement.35 Clearly, overweight results from an
imbalance between diet and physical and sedentary
activities, and thus, each of these lifestyle factors may
hold an association with academic performance. How-
ever, in the present study, weight status was not inde-
pendently associated with academic performance
when the associations between diet quality, socioeco-
nomic factors, and academic performance were consid-
ered. The lack of an independent association of weight
status suggests that underlying diet quality may be
largely contributing to the previously observed associ-
ation between childhood overweight and academic
achievement. School-based programs that promote
healthy eating and physical activity may therefore be
effective in both preventing childhood overweight and
improving academic performance.25,36 Our findings
further highlight the importance of promoting dietary
adequacy and variety, increased fruit and vegetable
intake, and moderate consumption of dietary fat as
key nutrition messages for school-based programs and
policies.
This study involved a population-based sample in
a relatively homogenous setting where almost all ele-
mentary school children attend public schools that
are similarly funded. The high response rate, relative
to other school-based surveys requiring parental con-
sent, and the use of a weighting factor in analyses to
adjust for nonresponse bias should be considered as
strengths. Conversely, the rate of nonresponse does
introduce the potential for bias of results. Systematic
differences between responders and nonresponders
other than income may introduce bias, which would
adversely affect the results and limit the generalizabil-
ity of the findings.
Our analyses were adjusted for various confound-
ers, most importantly socioeconomic confounders;
however, we may not exclude confounding by factors
that were not considered. The consistency of the rela-
tionship between diet quality and academic perfor-
mance across the various indices of diet quality is
a further strength of the present study. A variety of
outcomes for academic performance have been exam-
ined in the research.11,16,35,36 This study is unique in
that it linked nutritional information with census-level
data and standardized test results, minimizing bias in
the assessment of academic performance. However,
this study is limited by the extent to which 2 standard-
ized tests accurately measure academic performance.
The nutritional information was collected using the
YAQ, a validated food frequency questionnaire suitable
for this age-group; however, self-administered re-
sponses remain subject to error. Results of this study
highlight the associations between diet quality and
academic performance. However, the direction of
these associations cannot be ascertained from a cross-
sectional study. Interpretation of the demonstrated
association between diet quality and academic perfor-
mance is based on the literature surrounding this asso-
ciation and related theory that led to the development
of the research objectives. In order to demonstrate the
temporal sequence of the relationship, further longitu-
dinal research examining diet quality and academic
performance would need to be conducted. These
strengths and limitations should be considered when
interpreting the present findings and making compar-
isons with other studies.
In summary, we demonstrated that, above and
beyond socioeconomic factors, diet quality is impor-
tant to academic performance. This association is
important to children's future educational attainment
and herewith future income, socioeconomic status,
and health. These findings support the broader imple-
