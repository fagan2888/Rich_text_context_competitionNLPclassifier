Thin-Capitalization Rules and
Company Responses
Experience from German Legislation
Abstract
By granting intracompany loans to their foreign affiliates, multinational firms may reduce
their tax liability abroad. Many countries have legislated thin-capitalization rules (TCRs) that
limit the allowable levels of intracompany loans or restrict interest deductibility if certain
thresholds are crossed. This paper empirically analyzes the effect of the German TCR on
corporate policy. We find that tightening the regulations in 2001 had some limiting effect on
leverage. Foreign affiliates reacted by reducing intracompany loans and increasing equity,
with no significant evidence of reduced real investment. A possible reason for the limited
impact of the TCR was that multinational firms had the option to work around the regulation
by using holding company structures. Indeed, holding companies have been used to shift huge
amounts of intracompany loans onto the books of German affiliates. At the same time,
however, only part of these observed reorganizations seem to have been a reaction to TCR.

1. Introduction
There is growing empirical evidence that multinational firms adapt their financial policies in
a tax-efficient way. Studies on the financial structure of U.S. outbound investment (Foley,
Desai, and Hines 2004, Altshuler and Grubert 2003) as well as German outbound investment
(Mintz and Weichenrieder 2005) suggest that an increase in the host country tax rate by 10
percentage points on average increases the leverage of manufacturing firms by some 2­4
percentage points. Countries with high tax rates therefore seem to attract a considerable
amount of tax-deductible interest cost. To a considerable extent the debt that multinationals
shift into high-tax countries takes the form of cross-border intracompany loans. Germany,
which during most of the 1990s had the highest corporate tax rate among OECD countries,
is an obvious example. Ramb and Weichenrieder (2005) point out that at the end of the
1990s this type of finance on average accounted for some 20 percent of the balance-sheet
total of German manufacturing corporations that were held by a foreign direct investor.
Governments may react in several ways to curb tax-efficient financing schemes that
come at a tax revenue cost. One method taken by some home countries of multinationals
(Japan, the U.S., and Italy) is to use interest allocation rules.1 Under an interest allocation
rule, the interest deduction is allocated according to a pro rata share. That is, for tax
purposes, there may apply a compulsory shift of interest deductions from the parent firm to
the foreign affiliates.
In this paper we will consider thin-capitalization rules that are applied by host
countries of multinational firms. A thin-capitalization rule (TCR) typically restricts the tax
deductibility of interest if the amount of loans granted by the investor or a closely related
party is deemed excessive. In France, for example, an interest payment by a foreign-owned
corporation to its investor may be qualified as a dividend, if the loans provided by this

investor exceed 150% of her equity share. Similar TCRs with various ratios are used, for
example, in Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands.2 In recent years, thin-capitalization
rules have attracted additional political attention because of their possible interference with
European law. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) disallowed application of a former
German thin-capitalization rule to companies operating in Germany if the loan is given by
an investor located in an EU member country. The ECJ held that the rule selectively
discriminated against EU investors.
So far there have been few empirical studies on the economic effects of TCRs.3 A
recent exception is Buettner et al. (2007), who argue that German investment abroad tends to
be more tax-sensitive if the host country employs a TCR. Overesch and Wamser (2006)
provide some evidence that tightening of TCR rules reduces the fraction of intracompany
loans in German FDI financing. The present paper is an effort to further improve our
knowledge of the working of TCRs in practice. In this paper we will highlight the empirical
reactions of foreign companies to the German TCR legislation. Besides the immediate
question whether the introduction or tightening of the TCR has had the desired effects on the
amount of intracompany loans, a second question is how firms have accommodated. For
example, a multinational that faces restrictions in financing its German affiliate by
intracompany loans could react by using more equity or more third-party debt, or it could
reduce investment along with the amount of intracompany loans.
Yet another possibility is that multinationals succeed in working around legal
restrictions. Particular weak spots in the legislation may allow this. For example, the
German TCR, which was introduced in 1994, featured a special preference for holding
companies. It provided a safe-haven debt-to-equity ratio of 3:1 for all nonbank corporations,
but provided a more lenient 9:1 safe haven for holding companies. That is, an interest
payment from a German holding company to its foreign investor was safe from being

competition, see Haufler and Runkel (2008) or Fuest and Hemmelgarn (2005).

qualified as a dividend as long as ratio of the investor's loans to his or her equity in the firm
was smaller than 900 percent. Under the German 1994 TCR rule this may have invited the
use of domestic holding corporations to work around the more stringent 3:1 rule.4 A main
purpose of this paper is therefore not only to look at the financing reaction of foreign
affiliates in Germany, but also to consider empirically, by drawing on information provided
by the Deutsche Bundesbank database MiDi, the extent to which firms took advantage of
this loophole.
The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we will give a
description of the German TCR and describe its evolution over time. Section 3 introduces
the MiDi data that are used for the present analysis, and Section 4 then empirically examines
corporate reactions to the 2001 change in the German TCR. Section 5 investigates to what
extent holding companies have been used as vehicles to work around the German TCR.
Section 6 concludes.
2. The Evolution of the German TCR
In Germany, an explicit TCR was legislated in 1993 and became effective in January 1994.
Before that date no explicit rules existed.5 The newly introduced § 8a of the corporate tax
code (KStG) allowed the authorities to qualify an interest payment as a deemed dividend if
the loans granted by an investor exceeded three times his or her share in total corporate
equity as measured at the end of the last fiscal year. In such a case the deemed dividend then
reduced the tax deductibility of interest for German corporate taxes. An exception applied if
the firm could convincingly argue that the same loan would have also been granted by a
nonaffiliated third party or if the loan was only given temporarily. Effectively, the regulation
4 In a recent study, Weichenrieder and Mintz (2007) highlight possible additional roles of holding companies
for avoiding taxation in an international setting. Empirically, another important role is the minimization of
withholding taxes.
5 An attempt to curb thin capitalization by using a bylaw of the finance ministry was overturned by the courts.
See Weichenrieder (1995, p. 177) for an account of the history of the German TCR.
5
created a safe haven if the intracompany-debt-to-equity ratio of three or less was complied
with, while higher levels of thin capitalization created the risk of nondeductible interest
payments. The German TCR is only applicable if the investor's share in the corporation is at
least 25 percent (including shares held indirectly via affiliated entities). It also fails to be
binding for unincorporated businesses like branches of foreign multinationals and
partnerships. Since the rule only applied to investors who could not claim an imputation tax
credit for dividends to reduce German income taxes, the TCR was mainly relevant for
foreign owners of German corporations who are not subject to German income tax.
As mentioned above, the 1994 TCR gave a preference to holding companies that
could receive a loan from their owners up to nine times their equity stake in the firm (safe
haven of 9:1).6 To be considered a holding company under the regulation, a corporation
must either restrict itself to the provision of financial services to affiliated companies or hold
shares in other corporations amounting to 75% of total assets or more.
A first revision of § 8a KStG became effective in January 2001. From 2001 the safe
haven for nonholding companies was reduced to 1.5:1, i.e., an interest payment could be
deemed a dividend if the loans granted by an investor exceeded her share of the corporate
equity by 50 percent.7 While this further limited the amount of intracompany loans provided
by a foreign parent to a German affiliate, a preference for holding companies continued to
apply. The safe haven for these companies was set at a ratio of 3:1.
A second revision of the TCR was triggered by a ruling of the ECJ. In its decision of
12 December 2002 it held that the German rule discriminated against EU investors. This
triggered a revision of the German TCR, which became effective in January 2004. The rules
continue to allow deeming interest payments to affiliated parties to be dividends if the loan
granted by an investor exceeds 150 percent of the investor's share of corporate equity.8
6 A special provision is available for banks.
7 For loans with a variable interest rate a smaller safe haven of 0.5:1 applied.
8 Corporations that can argue that a third party would have granted the loan at a comparable interest rate may
exceed the ratio under the old and new rules.
6
However, they now apply to foreign and domestic investors alike. In addition, the
preferential safe haven for holding companies was lifted. As a measure to protect small and
medium-sized domestic firms with loans granted by their shareholders, interest is not
deemed a dividend if the interest paid to the investor falls short of 250,000. Because of
lacking data for the post-2004 era, this paper does not attempt to give empirical evidence on
the effects of this last revision, but is mainly concerned with the introduction and the 2001
revision. Finally, it should be mentioned that Germany has recently enacted a further change
in its approach towards thin capitalization. From the year 2008, the thin-capitalization rule
has been replaced by an earnings-stripping rule.9 Yet, the experience with previous
legislation can give potentially important lessons for the future and for other countries.
3. German FDI Statistics
To evaluate the impact of German TCR legislation we make use of the German FDI
database MiDi of the Deutsche Bundesbank. By law, affiliates of foreign investors have to
report a reduced balance sheet to the Deutsche Bundesbank if the total assets of the direct
investment meet mild size requirements. For wholly owned affiliates of foreign investors,
this was DM 500,000 from 1989 to 1992, DM 1,000,000 from 1993 to 2001, and 3,000,000
from 2002. In the case where a foreign-owned company holds yet another German company,
information has also to be provided on this dependent company, allowing a look at
ownership chains of foreign-owned firms in Germany.
Among other things, the database gives information on equity, third-party debt, loans
received from affiliated firms inside and outside Germany, and total assets of foreign-owned
affiliates in Germany. This information on financial structure makes the data a very good
basis for our empirical investigation.10
9 For details see Bundesministerium der Finanzen (2007).
10 Other studies that have used the German FDI database MiDi to identify tax effects on foreign-owned firms
include Becker, Fuest, and Hemmelgarn (2006) and Ramb and Weichenrieder (2005).
7
The firm-level data from 1996 to 2004 has a panel structure that allows tracking of
firms across years. Unfortunately, this panel structure is missing for the years 1989 to 1995,
and during this period firms cannot be traced over time. This implies that some effects of the
German legislation can only be measured in a limited way. If, for example, the introduction
of the TCR in 1994 has given incentives to use new holding companies to take advantage of
their preferential treatment, then this behavior can only be detected since 1996. Similarly,
changes in the financial structure from the 1994 introduction of the TCR cannot be traced on
a firm level during the period 1994­1996. Our evaluation of the empirical effects will
therefore rest largely on the analysis of the 2001 reform of the rules.
4. TCR and the effect on high-leveraged firms
A first empirical question is whether the introduction in 1994 and the further tightening in
2001 of the German TCR formed a binding restriction on firms with pronounced thin
capitalization and triggered a reduction in the relative prominence of intracompany loans.
Figure 1 provides some descriptive evidence for nonfinancial incorporated affiliates by
depicting the ratio R of an investor's loans (plus the loans granted by other foreign-affiliated
firms) to the 'investor's share of total equity in German-incorporated affiliates over time.11
More precisely, the figure plots this ratio for a firm in the 25th percentile, for one in the 75th
percentile, and for the median firm. The firms in the 75th percentile show very high
intracompany loans provided by the foreign investor relative to his share in total equity.
Throughout the period 1989­2002 all nonfinancial corporations in the 75th percentile
received loans from foreign investors or foreign-affiliated companies that amounted to more
than 200% of the foreign investor's equity. Simple eyeball econometrics would suggest that
11 While the German TCR calls for using the lagged values of equity when calculating the safe-haven ratio, we
have to rely on the current equity for pre-1996 periods, as firms can be followed over time only from 1996
onwards. For consistency reasons current equity is also used in Figure 1 for later years. Because of a special
exemption for banks and differences in balance sheets, we excluded financial firms.
8
the introduction of the TCR in 1994 and its tightening in 2001 were accompanied by a
decrease in intracompany debt. While the pre-1994 value was around 400% for a firm in the
75th percentile, it came down to some 300% after the introduction of the TCR and stayed in
this range for a couple of years, only to experience an additional decrease after the
tightening of the TCR in 2001.
Of course, the picture drawn by Figure 1 may be deceptive. It is conceivable that
even without the introduction and tightening of the TCR, a moderating time trend or other
reasons for a reduced use of intracompany loans were present. For example, the cut in the
German headline corporate tax from 40% to 25% in 2001 may have made intracompany
loans less attractive (see Ramb and Weichenrieder 2005).
Figure 2 is constructed similarly to Figure 1, but restricts attention to foreign-owned
branches (including partnerships), which are not subject to the German TCR. The graph
shows that thin capitalization is not restricted to corporations, but can also be found for
branches. Throughout the period 1989­2004, more than 20 percent of the unincorporated
foreign-owned firms had a ratio R above 2: loans from foreign affiliated firms amounted to
at least 200 percent of the foreign investor's equity. While branches have not been affected
by the introduction of the TCR in 1994 and its tightening in 2001, they also showed a
decline in the use of intracompany loans over time. Conversely, during the years following
the tightening of the rules in 2001, branches showed a smaller reduction in R than did
corporations. Like corporations, branches experienced a decrease in the federal German
profit tax rate from 40 to 25 percent in 2001.

In the next step we want to investigate econometrically the specific reactions that the
tightening of the TCR rules had on foreign-owned firms in Germany, using micro data. A
problem that persists even with micro data at hand is that any decrease in the relative use of
intracompany loans after the introduction may be attributable to a common time trend ­ the
(uniform) reduction of the income taxes on branches and incorporated affiliates, or other
common shocks ­ rather than to the tightening of the TCR. In other words, we are in need of
a control group that was not subject to the tightening of the TCR. While foreign-owned
corporations were potentially affected by the 2001 reform of the TCR, the regulations do not
apply to foreign partnerships and foreign-owned branches located in Germany. We therefore
consider these latter types of businesses as a potential control group, which we will in the
following call simply "branches".12
An important firm characteristic that we are interested in is the definition of intrafirm
debt as it is applied by the TCR. We therefore define the variable IRAT as the ratio of
intrafirm debt, which a company has received from foreign-affiliated firms, to the total
equity of the firm in the preceding year. The lag in the denominator of the ratio is motivated
by the fact that such a lag is present in the relevant definition of the safe haven in the
German tax code. Since in the following we will concentrate on years for which the data set
has a panel structure, we can eschew the (somewhat simpler) ratio R, which was used in
Figure 1 and Figure 2, and replace it with IRAT. In the year 2000, a company may either
have had an IRAT of more or less than 1.5. If the reform of the TCR was affecting firm
financial policy, then we should expect that firms that in 2000 had already complied with the
2001 safe haven had a smaller incentive to reduce their IRAT than did firms that found
themselves in a situation beyond the future safe haven. More importantly, within the group
of firms that in 2000 showed an IRAT of more than 1.5, corporations should have had a
12 A conceivable alternative control group consists of firms with less than 25 percent foreign ownership. We
did not pursue this alternative for two reasons. First, the number of foreign-owned firms having a foreign
ownership between 10 and 25 percent is relatively small. Second, unlike branches, these firms have a much
different financial structure with few loans from foreign-affiliated firms.
11
larger incentive to reduce their IRAT than branches, as the TCR and its revision were not
applicable to the latter group. In particular, corporations should have felt a larger incentive
to reduce the ratio than branches. The strategy to empirically identify the effects of the
regulation therefore is to look at whether corporations that in the year 2000 started with an
IRAT of more than 150 percent showed a subsequent reduction in the amount for
intracompany loans that was larger than the reduction for the control groups.13
Of course, to be a suitable control group, branches should have similar financial
structures to corporations. As Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, this was roughly the case in 2000,
the year preceding the reform.
We start the empirical analysis by defining several variables. CORP takes on the
value 1 if the firm under consideration is incorporated (and potentially affected by the TCR).
It is zero otherwise. Conversely, the dummy BRANCH takes on the value 1 if CORP = 0.
The variable RATIO is created as a dummy that equals zero if a firm in the year 2000 had an
IRAT below or equal to 1.5, and that equals one otherwise. Finally, we employ a time
dummy D01_02 that marks the years 2001 and 2002 in which the tightened regulation was
effective, but takes on the value zero in 2000.
The variables used in our regression are built by interacting these dummies:
(1) CORP_HIGH_01_02 = CORP  RATIO  D01_02,
(2) CORP_LOW_01_02 = CORP  (1 ­ RATIO)  D01_02,
(3) BRANCH_HIGH_01_02 = (1 ­ CORP)  RATIO  D01_02,
(4) BRANCH_LOW_01_02 = (1 ­ CORP)  (1 ­ RATIO)  D01_02.
13 We decided not to use data on 2003, because such data could have been contaminated by the expectation of
the 2004 reform.
12
With the help of these variables we can form a baseline regression that uses IRAT as
the endogenous variable:
(5) IRATit
= tt
+ fi
+ b1
 CORP_HIGH_01_02it
+ b2
 BRANCH_HIGH_01_02 it
+ b3
 BRANCH_LOW_01_02it
+ b4
 SALESit
+ uit
.
Here t is a year fixed effect, f is a firm fixed effect, and SALES is the yearly turnover
of an observed firm. u is the error term. By construction, b1
, b2
, and b3
measure how the
endogenous variable developed in 2001 and 2002 compared to the starting year 2000. More
precisely, because we included time fixed effects, the coefficients capture the differential
effect with respect to the excluded base group CORP_LOW, i.e., the group of corporations
that started out with IRAT < 1.5 in 2000. First, we expect that the coefficient b1
will be
significantly negative, since corporations that started out with IRAT2000
> 1.5 should have
felt a larger pressure to adapt their financial structure than corporations that were already
complying. While such a negative coefficient would be consistent with an influence of the
TCR on financial policy, it could also result from a general tendency of high-leveraged firms
to return to lower leverage. Therefore, we will also test whether b1
is significantly different
from the coefficient b2
that takes up the reactions of thinly capitalized branches.
To perform the regression we introduced several restrictions on the sample of
selected firms. First, while the MiDi database contains firms that are indirectly owned by a
foreign investor via a German intermediate firm, we concentrate on firms that are directly
held by a foreign investor with an ownership share of at least 25%. Only this type of firms
was affected by the pre-2004 TCR. Second, we drop firms that have more than one foreign
investor. The reason is that the TCR requires calculating the ratio IRAT on an investor level,
which from our data is impossible if there is more than one foreign investor. Third, to
calculate the ratio IRAT for the year 2000 we need 1999 information on equity. This
additionally reduces the sample. Fourth, we exclude observations with negative values of
lagged equity, as in these cases it is not possible to calculate a sensible value for IRAT.
Fifth, we excluded holding companies, banks, and other financial firms that received a
13
different treatment under the TCR and/or possess a very different financial structure. Finally,
we require the firms in our sample to have three consecutive observations.14 This leaves us
with a working sample of 1699 corporations and branches observed over the period 2000­
2002.
Table 1 gives an overview of the firms in our four different baskets. Using the
borderline of IRAT = 1.5, we have 109 branches with low levels of thin capitalization
(IRAT  1.5), and 34 branches with a high level (IRAT > 1.5). Corporations are somewhat
more likely to fall in the high basket than branches: we have 576 high-leveraged
corporations and 980 for which IRAT  1.5.
Within the group of branches (corporations) that in 2000 had a ratio of 1.5 or less, the
average was 0.286 (0.437). Branches and incorporated affiliates are roughly similar when
we look at the subgroups of firms that in 2000 had IRAT > 1.5: for incorporated firms IRAT
then averaged 525 percent, compared to 431 percent for branches.
Interestingly, the average size of the firms (as measured by turnover) in the four
baskets hardly depends on incorporation. Indeed, the average sales in the low and high
baskets are slightly higher for branches.
Table 2 reports the result for the empirical model in equation (5), while Table 3
contains the relevant descriptive statistics of the sample. First, consider the column in
Table 2 that uses IRAT as the dependent variable. As explained above, we grouped firms
into four baskets. We included dummies for three groups and chose low-leveraged
corporations as the base case for which no dummy applies. The significant negative
coefficient of the variable CORP_HIGH_01_02 therefore indicates that corporations that in
2000 started out with high intracompany loans (IRAT > 1.5) significantly reduced their thin
14 During our period of interest (2000­2002) there was a change in the reporting requirement that induced the
dropout of a large number of small firms with less than 3 million balance sheet total. The requirement of three
consecutive observations makes sure that for our sample the number of observations per firm is not correlated
with firm size. Since the endogenous variable is a ratio with equity in the denominator, equity losses
sometimes produce very extreme values in the endogenous variable. We therefore excluded 5 percent of the
remaining firms on the basis that their value of IRAT in one of the three years exceeded 20.9. We also
excluded a limited number of firms that changed from an incorporated to an unincorporated status during our
period of interest.
14
capitalization in the following two years, in contrast with corporations that started out with a
value of IRAT below 1.5.
While this result is indicative, one may object that corporations in the high-leveraged
subsample had simply more opportunity to reduce this ratio. To infer whether the tightening
of the thin-cap rules was effective, it is therefore necessary to compare the corporations that
started with IRAT > 1.5 with those unincorporated firms that also started out with a high
level of thin capitalization. If there is a different effect on corporations from that on
unincorporated firms that were not affected by the tightening of the regulation, then we
should expect the coefficient b1
to be significantly different (smaller) from the estimated
coefficient b2
. Indeed, this is the case, and the linear restriction b1
= b2
is rejected at the 5-
percent level. On average, high-leveraged corporations reduced IRAT by 120 percentage
points more than high-leveraged branches.
The next five columns report how other balance sheet items have reacted to the
tightening of the TCR. One way to accommodate a reduction of intracompany loans could
be to reduce investment. The results in the second column give no evidence of such a
reaction. The coefficient for high-leveraged corporations does not differ from that of low-
leveraged corporations, nor does it differ from the one for high-leveraged unincorporated
firms. The hypothesis b1
= b2
cannot be rejected at usual significance levels. The third
regression shows that, if anything, corporations that tended to be affected by the tightening
of the TCR increased their financial assets more than other corporations. But the test b1
= b2
is only rejected at the 11-percent level. Another possible reaction of corporations to
accommodate to the tightened TCR is to increase equity. In comparison with low-leveraged
corporations, the increase in equity for high-leveraged corporations indeed is highly
significant. When the change is compared with the change for unincorporated firms with
high leverage, however, the difference in differences is not significant. The fifth regression
in Table 2 shows the relative change in intracompany loans. The estimated coefficient of
-1.034 for b1
implies that, compared with low-leveraged levered corporations, high-
15
leveraged corporations reduced their average amount of intracompany loans by 103
percent.15 The comparison with high-leveraged unincorporated businesses yields no
significant results, that is, the hypothesis b1
= b2
cannot be refuted.
The estimated coefficients for log SALES turn out to be insignificant in columns 1
through 4 of Table 2, but at least weakly significant and positive in columns 5 and 6. This
suggests that firms that experience an increase in sales tend to prefer an increase in
intracompany loans and third-party debt over an increase in equity.

To examine the robustness of our results and to gain additional insights into the
working of the thin-capitalization rules, we also tested a finer grouping of firms. For that
purpose we divided all firms for which in the year 2000 IRAT was larger than 1.5 into three
subgroups. HIGH1 (HIGH2, HIGH3) indicates the lowest (middle, highest) leveraged
subgroup with IRAT > 1.5. The dividing lines between these subgroups were drawn such
that each of the three groups had the same number of firms. This produced the following
thresholds based on year 2000 information. For subgroup HIGH1, 1.5 < IRAT < 2.61. For
subgroup HIGH2 (HIGH3), 2.61 < IRAT < 5 (IRAT > 5). While this additional grouping
may allow identifying more exactly what types of firms did react, the split-up produces
rather small groups of unincorporated affiliates against which the development of
corporations can be compared. While 188, 189, and 199 corporations fall in the groups
HIGH1, HIGH2, and HIGH3, the corresponding group sizes are 13, 12, and 9 for branches.
15 This of course must imply that the control group of firms on average increased their intracompany loans,
allowing for a difference of more than 100 percent.

As in the regressions of Table 2, corporations that start out with a low level of IRAT
in 2000 act as the baseline group against which other groups of firms are compared. The
numbers of firms and total observations are also kept unchanged. The estimates for the
variables CORP_HIGH1_01_02, CORP_HIGH2_01_02, and CORP_HIGH3_01_02
confirm that highly thin-capitalized corporations significantly reduced IRAT after the year
2000 as compared to less leveraged corporations. The comparison between corporations and
17
branches in different thin-capitalization groups is captured by the three tests in the lower
part of the table. The results show that only in the extremely leveraged comparison groups
did corporations have a significantly stronger reduction of IRAT than branches. While this
seems to suggest limited evidence for the impact of the 2001 reform on corporations, one
should keep in mind the rather small group sizes.
As in Table 2, the results of Table 4 show now evidence that corporations reacted to
the tightened TCR by disinvesting (column 2) or reducing financial assets (column 3). At the
same time, the results in column (4) suggest that the affected corporations increased their
equity to comply with the tightened rules. The significance of the reduction in intracompany
loans depends on the comparison group. The reduction is always significant for high-
leveraged corporations if the comparison is with low-leveraged corporations. If compared
with branches having similar leverage, then the policy change is only significant for group
HIGH2.

.
By and large, our estimation results indicate that the tightened TCR was successful in
reducing thin capitalization.16 At the same time, we find no evidence that firms that were
most likely to be affected by the new rule reduced investment.17 Instead, the results suggest
16 This is also confirmed by a recent paper by Overesch and Wamser (2006) that does not consider the exact
channels through which the firms reacted.
17 We also checked whether firms that, because of their initial value of IRAT, were particularly affected by the
TCR tightening had a smaller survival probability in subsequent years, but found no such evidence.
19
that corporations with high levels of thin capitalization increased their equity and tended to
reduce intracompany loans.
5. The creation of ownership chains
As discussed in the previous section, a foreign firm that faces the need to adjust its
financial structure because of a thin-capitalization rule may increase its equity base, increase
the use of third-party debt, or reduce the amount of intracompany loans along with total
assets.
In the German case, also a less straightforward route was conceivable. Given that
holding companies enjoyed a preferential safe haven under the 1994 TCR, foreign investors
may have found it attractive to use an ownership chain to circumvent the implications of the
TCR for nonholding companies. Figure 3 illustrates. Under a direct ownership structure
(case A), the allowable debt-to-equity ratio was 3:1 for fiscal years 1994 to 2000. Under an
alternative indirect structure (case B), the parent establishes a holding company and endows
it with a debt-to-equity ratio as high as 9:1. These funds can be used by the holding company
to buy the preexisting affiliate from the parent without triggering a net inflow of funds into
Germany.18 The larger the purchase price, the larger the total debt and equity that can be
allocated to the holding company. Since the holding company is a German legal entity, it
does not fall under the 1994 TCR and may endow the affiliate with debt. But even if it holds
only equity of the affiliate, the total allowable intracompany debt that could be channeled to
Germany is larger than in the direct case.
Unlike in the direct case A, the dividends paid by the affiliates do not directly accrue
to the parent, but take a route via a holding company. In a last step, to ensure that the interest
paid on the parent debt is tax-deductible from the profits earned by the affiliate, the two
18 It should be mentioned that the holding company, to qualify for the preferential safe haven, had to hold at
least one additional company, the size of which was irrelevant, however.
20
German affiliates have to enter into a profit transfer agreement to assure tax consolidation
between the holding company and the affiliate, which allows interest paid by the affiliate to
be used to reduce profits transferred to the holding company.

After 2000, a change from a direct to an indirect ownership structure still allowed
larger amounts of intracompany debt for German affiliates, but, as laid out above, while the
safe haven for normal corporations was set to 1.5:1, the safe haven for holding companies
was only lowered to 3:1. The scheme laid out above was well known to tax-law practitioners
(see Krebs 1998), and it is an empirical question to what extent it indeed was used to escape
the German TCR. Our principal question in this section therefore is the possible extent to
which foreign-owned firms have changed their internal structure from a direct one to an
indirect one as illustrated by Figure 3?
Again, our investigation is impeded by the fact that the database MiDi lacks a panel
structure for years prior to 1996, which makes it impossible to track foreign affiliates over
time for the period 1993­1996, so changes in the ownership structure can only be detected
21
after 1996. A change in ownership structure from direct to indirect may have been motivated
by the TCR if the following conditions hold:
- The corporation that is used to form the ownership chain must be a holding company, as
only those could benefit from the preferential safe haven.
- The ownership fraction that the holding company acquires in the affiliate must be at least
50%, the minimum to establish a profit transfer agreement that is accepted for tax
purposes.
- The dependent affiliate must be outside the banking industry, as this industry is not
affected by the German TCR.

Annotation: The table reports the number of affiliates that are reported as indirectly held via a German
intermediate holding company, but were owned directly by a foreign investor in the preceding reported year.
To be included, the dependent affiliate must not be in the banking sector, and the holding company in the
ownership chain in the current year must own at least 50% of the equity. As in the preceding section, we
excluded affiliates with more than one foreign investor.
Based on the above criteria, we found a total of 389 foreign-owned affiliates that initially
were held directly by a foreign investor and were transformed into an indirect participation
via a German holding company at some point between 1996 and the end of 2003. In 94

22
cases, the change from direct to indirect ownership via a German holding company left the
identity of the foreign parent unchanged (Table 5, column 1). But some of the restructurings
were accompanied by other changes in ownership: in 182 cases the inclusion of the German
holding company was accompanied by a change in the identity of the foreign parent firm,
but the new parent resided in the same country (Table 5, column 3).20 In these cases, the
restructuring in Germany may have been going along with a restructuring of the corporate
group in the parent country. A German affiliate that used to be held via a certain corporation
abroad may have been moved to a different corporation within the same company group.
Hence, the ultimate foreign group that owns the German affiliate could have stayed the
same. Conversely, the previous parent may have sold the German affiliate to a new investor
who then preferred a German ownership chain rather than direct ownership. In this second
case, tax considerations are less likely to be the decisive reason for the change to indirect
ownership. For example, the new owner at the time of purchase of the German affiliate may
have already owned a German holding company and for governance reasons may have
decided to transfer the ownership to it. Indeed, while only 30% of the 94 affiliates in column
1 were transferred to a preexisting holding company for which data in the database is
available years prior to acquisition, ownership for 57% of the 182 companies of column 2
was transferred to a preexisting German holding company. So we decided to report this case
separately.
Besides the cases reported in columns 1 and 3, column 5 also reports cases in which
both the parent and the country of the parent have changed. In these cases, 55% of the
affiliates were transferred to preexisting holding companies, 45% of the affiliates were taken
over by holding companies that in the previous years were not included in the database.
20 The MiDi database does not give information on characteristics of the foreign parent, but it reports an
identification number for the parent and the country of residency.

A first question is whether the changes in ownership structure that are described by
Table 5 have economic significance. The 94 affiliates that are reported in column 1
represented a balance sheet total of some 13.8bn. evaluated at the end of the year in which
the respective changes in the ownership link occurred. The equivalent figure for the group of
182 affiliates in column 3 is 22.3bn., and the balance sheet total of the 113 affiliates in
column 5 was 9.5bn. These figures compare to the balance sheet total of all directly held
affiliates in our sample (with at least 50 percent foreign ownership, outside banking) of
180bn. in 1997, representing 6198 affiliates. The comparable figure for 2004 is 415bn.,
representing 3980 affiliates.21 Clearly, the firms that experienced a change from direct
ownership to indirect ownership via a German holding company were above average size,
and the total assets involved are considerable, reflecting a moderate but nonmarginal
fraction of total foreign-owned assets in Germany.
In a next step, we investigate to what extent the changes in the ownership links have
triggered an increase in total debt within Germany and, concurrently, an increase of debt tax
shelter. Table 6 collects the relevant data. Since the advantages of using a German holding
company structure were lowered by the 2001 TCR reform, we split all restructurings
between 1997 and 2003 into those that occurred until 2000 and those that occurred between
2000 and 2003. When we compare the year before and after the change of the ownership
link and look at the total debt variable for the 94 firms with a constant ultimate parent, we
find that the total volume of debt was roughly kept constant. For those firms restructured
before 2001, columns 1 and 2 indicate that the aggregated value of total debt was 4.0bn.
before and 4.1bn. in the year after the restructuring. Restructurings after 2000, in total,
have been associated with a reduction in debt. The fact that the restructurings did not
significantly increase the debt levels of affiliates does not rule out a tax motivation for the
change in the ownership link. Such a conclusion would overlook that the holding companies
heavily increased their debt levels. For these, the aggregated values of total debt increased
21 The reduction of the number of affiliates is due to a redefinition of the reporting requirements in 2002.
25
by 6.9bn. in 1997­2000 and by 1.0bn in 2001­2003. These changes mainly reflect an
aggregated increase in loans from affiliated companies outside Germany by 6.0bn.
(0.5bn.) in 1997­2000 (2001­2003). The total assets of the holding companies involved
moved from 3.0bn. to 15.2bn. in the first time window and from 7.6bn. to 12.5bn. in the
second (columns 4 and 5).22 The increase in total assets that was experienced by the holding
companies in both time windows was somewhat larger than the total assets of the affiliates
that were taken over. This may indicate either that the purchase price (paid to the foreign
parent) was considerably larger than the equity of the acquired affiliate, or that the holding
company bought other assets during the year of the ownership change. The database allows
calculating the increase in financial assets of the holding companies that are associated with
the year of the ownership change. The vast majority of the 12.2bn (4.9bn.) in years 1997­
2000 (2001­2003) reflected an increase in shares in affiliated companies. Only a small
portion of the increase came from investments in other financial assets. Hence, if the holding
companies invested in other assets than the German affiliate, which was acquired from the
parent, then the other financial investments were also in affiliated firms.
Overall, the data for the 94 cases in which a directly held affiliate has been
transformed into an indirect participation implies that the transactions were suitable for
reducing taxable income in Germany. On the one hand, the funds channeled to Germany are
used by the holding companies to earn tax-exempt income from owning shares in affiliated
companies. On the other hand, a large fraction of the funds provided by the foreign parent
took the form of intracompany loans, the interest on which is tax-deductible in Germany and
taxable abroad. The extent to which the ownership restructurings have pumped debt into
Germany has changed over the years. While the holding companies involved have increased
their borrowings from affiliated companies considerably when the holding company
privilege was still generous (i.e., before 2001), the effect in later years has flattened off.
22 For this calculation the debt and total assets of firms that did not appear in the data prior to the ownership
change was set to zero. Since the reporting requirements are rather moderate, this should lead to only small
errors.
26
Next, consider the 182 cases in which the affiliate experienced a change from direct
to indirect participation, but the ultimate parent changed even though the country of the
ultimate investor stayed the same. Again, a comparison of the last year before the ownership
change to the first balance sheet after the change shows that, also in this group of
restructurings, most changes in leverage occurred at the level of the German holding
companies, but hardly at the level of the ultimate German affiliate. Total assets of the 182
affiliates moved from 14.8bn. to 16.6bn. (5.0 to 5.7bn.), and their debt increased by
0.2bn (0.5bn). At the same time, the shares in affiliated companies of the holding
companies involved increased by 20.6bn. (14.2bn.) for restructurings in the period 1997­
2000 (2001­2003). The takeover of the preexisting affiliates went along with a huge
increase in debt levels at the holding company level. Total debt increased by 14.9bn. and
10.7bn. in the two time windows, and the lion's share involved intracompany loans.
Finally, consider the 128 cases of changes in the ownership chain that implied a
change of the country of the foreign direct investor. Evaluated at the year after the
ownership change, the total assets of the affiliates were 4.7bn. and 4.8bn. during the two
time windows. Compared to these values, the increase in the shares of the holding
companies was quite pronounced at 9.6bn. and 5.2bn. In the first (second) time window,
the restructuring was associated with an increase of cross-border intracompany loans by
6.0bn. (1.3bn.).
Taken together, the figures in Table 6 imply that the 389 cases of restructuring of
ownership were accompanied by an increase of intracompany loans to German holding
companies of 37.4bn., 68% of which occurred before the tightening of the TCR from 2001.
Since a large fraction of holding companies that served as vehicles to increase
German intracompany loans are new establishments, this points to a potential problem of
previous studies that tried to identify the effects of international tax differentials on leverage
decisions. Often these studies employ fixed-effects panel estimations that cannot take up the
27
effect of new firms. To the extent that changes of leverage are conducted by using new
vehicles, within estimators that only capture the change occurring in existing affiliates may
underestimate debt shifting activities.
The above calculations illustrate that ownership restructurings have been extensively
used to increase the level of intracompany loans from abroad. A remaining issue is the
extent to which the increase in intracompany loans would have been possible without the use
of holding companies. Instead of using intermediate holding companies, a directly held
affiliate could pay out accumulated earnings as a dividend and borrow back these funds from
its foreign parent. The attractiveness of this policy option depends of course on whether the
TCR are already binding, and this is likely if the intracompany loans are larger than the
relevant save haven. Evidence is provided by considering equity and intracompany loans
from abroad aggregated on a company group level for those foreign investments that have
been restructured using a German intermediate holding company. For this purpose, we take
the sum of all intracompany loans that a group of German affiliates owes to affiliated
companies outside Germany and divide it by the total equity of all the affiliates that are
directly held by the foreign parent. We do not include the equity of indirectly held affiliates,
as this should already be reflected in the equity of the German intermediate firm. Groups of
companies are identified by the same identification number of their foreign parent. All
numbers are collected for the years after an ownership change.
The figures collected in Table 7 show that in many cases, the aggregated ratio of
cross-border intracompany loans to parent equity (post restructuring) would have complied
with the respective TCR even without making use of the holding company privilege. For
example, the median ratio for all company groups before 2001 was 2.136, when the German
TCR still provided a safe haven of 3. Similarly, the median for 2001­2003 was 1.228, when
1.5 was allowed by TCR standards. This suggests that for some foreign-owned firms the
ownership restructuring may have been the preferred way of increasing leverage in Germany
for other reasons than working round the TCR. At the same time, for quite a number of
28
cases, the overall ratio of intracompany loans to net equity was beyond the respective safe
haven, and the intention to work around the TCR is a prime candidate for explaining the
restructuring.

Table 8, which takes advantage of the same measure of leverage as Table 7, reports
on the exact number of restructurings that led to a thin capitalization above the safe haven
level in the absence of a holding company and its privilege. Aggregated across all three
types of restructurings, this has been the case for some 50% of the restructured affiliates. If
we look at the relevant fraction of total debt increases due to higher holding company debt,
we arrive at 58.1% for the 1997-2000 period and at 77.2% for 2001-2003. The available
evidence suggests that debt increases were concentrated in groups of firms with pronounced
29
thin capitalization (after restructuring). At the same time it suggests that in many cases the
overall debt levels reached by the ownership change would have been possible without the
intermediate holding company.
6. Summary and Conclusions
The paper has looked at the experience of the German TCR from various angles. The
introduction in 1994 as well as the tightening of the rules in 2001 was followed by a visible
reduction of thin capitalization among the foreign-owned affiliates with the largest fraction
of cross-border intracompany borrowings as a fraction of equity. However, the role of the
thin-capitalization rules needed careful econometric consideration, as the intracompany
loans of branches, which did not fall under the TCR, experienced the same declining trend.
The econometric analysis produced a significant effect of the TCR: the reduction of the ratio
between loans from affiliated parties and foreign-owned equity was more pronounced for
high-leveraged corporations then for unincorporated affiliates starting with a similar share of
thin capitalization. In the German case, the TCR did not seem to produce a reduction in
investment. While not or only weakly significant, our results suggest that affiliates reacted
by using more equity and more third-party debt.
A second part of the paper has highlighted a loophole of the legislation that was due
to a preference given to holding companies. For this reason, foreign multinationals could
work around the German TCR by introducing a German intermediate holding company that
used loans from affiliated companies abroad to buy a preexisting affiliate. Based on the
MiDi data of the Deutsche Bundesbank, the paper shows that for the period 1997-2003 the
use of holding company structures has been responsible for a total of more than 37bn. of
new intracompany loans in the nonfinancial sector, which should have led to a sizable
increase in tax-deductible interest in Germany and a loss in tax revenues. However,
restructurings of this type were also observed in cases where the relative level of
30
intracompany loans was low. Therefore, not all of the restructurings that have taken place
can be interpreted as an effort to work around the TCR. Instead, for some of the cases the
use of a leveraged intermediate holding company may have been considered an easier
approach than an increase in the leverage of the operating affiliate. This is a potentially
important message for empirical estimates of the elasticity of leverage with respect to tax
rates. In many cases the empirical identification strategy has looked at the within variation
of tax rates and leverage for a given set of affiliates. If multinationals rather react to tax
differentials by setting up new affiliates, then the within variation may seriously
underestimate the tax-rate elasticity of leverage.
