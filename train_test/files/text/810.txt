THE SHORTCOMINGS
OF VOLUNTARISM
IN THE SMALL-GROUP
INSURANCE MARKET
by Catherine G. McLaughlin and Wendy K. Zellers
Prologue: Americas reliance on voluntary solutions to vexing
social problems is a theme that runs through its history. Private
foundations are public trusts that society, in its search for volun-
tary solutions, turns to for social experimentation and innova-
tion. Sometimes foundations achieve success in their pursuits;
often they do not. But whatever the outcome, most foundations
do not evaluate their program efforts with the same energy and
expenditure that was allocated for their design. Occasionally,
though, foundations do put forth the extra effort, as this paper
by Catherine McLaughlin and Wendy Zellers indicates. Along
with colleague Lawrence D. Brown, the authors were enlisted
by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to evaluate the re-
sults of its Health Care for the Uninsured Program. In this
paper, they underscore the challenge of structuring a set of in-
centives that encourage people to change their behavior voluntar-
ily--in this case, to buy health insurance. As a part of their ef-
fort, they collected survey data in four of the nine program sites
on the small businesses that offered health insurance to their em-
ployees and those that did not. The data showed that useful pro-
jects that reduced the number of working uninsured people were
created in the four sites, but the evaluators also found that the
market penetration ranged from 2 to 17 percent, with only one
project in the double digits. Their conclusion: Larger efforts are
required to make significant reductions in the number ofpeople
who lack health insurance. The Robert Wood Johnson Founda-
tion retained McLaughlin and Brown several years ago to evalu-
ate another of its efforts--the Community Programs for Afford-
able Health Care--and their findings were published in Health
Affairs (Winter 1990). McLaughlin holds a doctorate in eco-
nomics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Zellers re-
ceived a master's degree in public health from the University of
California, Berkeley.

Concern for the growing number of uninsured, and particularly the
working uninsured, prompted The Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation (RWJF) to initiate the Health Care for the Uninsured
Program in January 1986. In creating this program, the foundation aimed
to support the development and implementation of new public/private
health care financing arrangements at the state and local level Although
many of the fifteen projects sponsored by the program used multiple
strategies, the primary focus has been the development and marketing of
affordable health insurance products for small businesses.1
Of the projects targeted to uninsured small businesses, nine eventually
enrolled firms to participate.2 As part of the overall program evaluation,
survey data were collected from over 1,300 small businesses in four
communities on the prevalence and characteristics of small businesses
and their employees with and without health benefits and those partici-
pating in the sponsored plans. The results of these surveys give an
indication of what well-coordinated, subsidized public/private initiatives
can accomplish and of how many and what kinds of small firms will elect
to remain without health insurance.
In general, the foundation-sponsored projects have enrolled a rela-
tively small percentage of the small businesses in their target areas; in
many ways, those businesses do not differ significantly from the firms
already offering health insurance to their employees. In our four survey
sites, the market penetration rate--that is, the percentage of small
businesses not offering health insurance that then enrolled in the
foundation-sponsored plan--ranged from 2 percent to 17 percent, with
only one project in the double digits. So, although these projects have
increased slightly the number of employees with insurance, they are not
making great inroads into the hard core of small businesses not inter-
ested in offering coverage, given current options.
Description Of Study Sites
Several strategies have been pursued by the four sites we studied
(Exhibit 1). The Pima County (Tucson, Arizona) foundation-sponsored
project, Health Care Group, was administered by the state's Medicaid
program (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System [AHCCCS])
and contracted with an AHCCCS health maintenance organization
(HMO) in Tucson to offer four insurance plan options, varying in
deductible levels and coinsurance rates. An indirect subsidy from the
state, which provided administrative and marketing services to the
HMO, reduced premiums to about 9.5 percent below their market rate.

determine whether or not (and for how long) businesses had to be uninsured (that is, could not offer a group health

c These figures represent the minimum percentage required from each employer.
d Projects with indirect subsidies keep premium costs down by paying administrative and marketing expenses, by
funding or facilitating the purchase of reinsurance, or by providing stop-loss protection. Projects with direct
subsidies keep premium costs down by paying at least some portion of the premium amount on behalf of
employees, employers, or the insurance company.
Corporation was set up under the auspices of the Florida Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services, Florida Health Access contracted
with a private HMO for coverage that offered high- and low-option
plans, with copayments and covered benefits varying in the two options.
The state provided an indirect subsidy not only by supporting the Florida
Health Access Corporation's administrative and marketing functions,
but also by paying the sponsoring HMO directly for claims from $15,000
to $115,000, thereby enabling premiums to be set 25 to 40 percent
below market rates for comparable products.
The demonstration project in Genessee County (Flint, Michigan),
the Health Care Access Project, offered several approved "off-the-shelf '
insurance plans already available in the community. In what was called
the One-Third Share Plan, employers paid one-third of the premium.
Direct state subsidies were available to employees who had been on
general assistance prior to employment. Depending on the employee's
income level, the state paid either one-third or two-thirds of the pre-
mium, with the employee paying either one-third or nothing.

Plan for Private Employers (SCOPE) designed a plan that promotes
outpatient and primary provider care and requires high copayments for

$5,000). A national indemnity insurer contracted with the Denver
Department of Health and Hospitals to sell the plan in the area.
Too many confounding factors exist to allow us to ascertain the
extent to which individual plan or site characteristics contributed to
market penetration rates. However, information about what kinds of
firms were enrolling in each project is valuable in evaluating the effects
of different approaches. In addition to surveying small businesses, we
surveyed insurance companies and agents in the four sites. The data help
clarify what incentives and changes would be needed to make significant
increases in the provision of employer-based health insurance.
Study Methods
The Small Business Benefits Survey (SBBS) was conducted by the
Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan during
the summer of 1990 in the four sites. A small business was defined as one
with two to twenty-five persons working more than seventeen hours per
week, including any owner(s) who also worked at that location more
than seventeen hours per week. Because of the high employee turnover
in this market, we asked respondents to count only those persons work-
ing the week before the firm was surveyed. To be eligible for our survey,
small businesses that were part of a multibranch firm had to have
decision-making power for the health benefits offered to employees.
Sample frame. The sample frames of participant firms in Tucson,
Tampa, and Flint were the complete census of businesses enrolled in the
foundation-sponsored plan at the time of the study. In Denver, the
sample frame of participants represented a subset of enrolled firms com-
piled by Denver project staff. This subset consisted of firms with two to
twenty-five persons working who indicated at the time of enrollment
that they would be willing to be contacted at some later date for a
survey--a stipulation placed by the insurance company selling the plan.
Of the 224 eligible firms, 188 were willing to be contacted. There was no
apparent participation bias according to size or type of business.
Sample frames for the comparison firms--that is, firms that did not
participate in the Health Care for the Uninsured Program--originated
from either Dun and Bradstreet's Dun's Marketing Indicator (DMI) lists
or the Employment Security Section 202 data (ES-202). DMI is a
commercially available sample frame of all businesses that have applied
for any type of credit, supplemented by various forms of business identi-
fication, including the Yellow Pages phone directory. State ES-202 data
are composed of all businesses within a state that file for unemployment
insurance payments. The sample frame in Tucson was restricted to the

DMI list because the state would not release ES-202 data. In Tampa,
Flint, and Denver, comparison firms were drawn from both lists. Analy-
sis of the two frames indicated few differences.3
Comparison firms from both frames were selected using a stratified
random technique. Selection strata were defined by firm size and Stand-
ard Industrial Code (SIC). Employment-size strata were two to four
employees, five to nine employees, and ten to twenty-five employees.
SIC code strata consisted of ( 1 ) agriculture, mining, and construction;
(2) manufacturing, utilities, and transportation; (3) wholesale and retail
trade; (4) finance and professional services; and (5) other services.
Survey mode and instrument. A dual-mode mail and telephone
survey was undertaken. All businesses in the sample were first contacted
by phone to establish the eligibility of the business, identify the person
who would act as a respondent to the mail survey, and obtain correct
address information. All eligible businesses who completed the screen-
ing interview received a survey packet in the mail. Over the next few
weeks, nonrespondents received a reminder and a second packet. Three
weeks after the second mailing, all of the remaining nonresponding
participant firms and a subset of the remaining comparison firms were
selected for a telephone interview.
The survey questionnaire consisted of two sections: one that con-
tained questions about firm-level characteristics, and one that consisted
of a grid that asked for demographic and health insurance information
about each individual employee, up to eight employees. Because of
respondents' time constraints, firms with more than eight persons work-
ing more than seventeen hours per week (18.5 percent of the sample)
were asked at the time of the screening call to list all eligible employees.
From this list, seven employees were randomly selected and, along with
the eligible owner, were entered in the grid with unique identifiers.
Appropriate weights were then applied to these subsets in the analysis.
Results Of The Survey
Response rates. The SBBS response rates were high relative to the
response rates experienced by most national surveys of small businesses.4
Rates among participant firms ranged from 71 percent in Tampa to 84
percent in Flint, with Tucson and Denver at 80 percent and 82 percent,
respectively. In Flint, where all comparison firms were contacted by
phone, the response rate was slightly less, 74 percent. In the other cities,
response rates were much smaller for the comparison firms (Tucson, 58
percent; Tampa, 54 percent; and Denver, 55 percent), reflecting the fact
that only half of the firms that did not respond to the mail survey were

selected for a telephone interview. Based on the telephone response rate
for the 50 percent subsample, we estimate the "effective" response rate
in Tucson, Tampa, and Denver to be 70-75 percent.
Three components of the analysis weights were applied to the SBBS
samples of participants and comparisons: ( 1 ) a basic sample selection
weight, (2) a nonresponse adjustment, and (3) a population poststratifi-
cation factor. All results reported use weighted data.
Coverage. Even among this group of small firms, the propensity to
offer health insurance clearly increases with firm size (Exhibit 2). This
trend is due in part to the fact that many small-group policies are not
available for firms with fewer than ten workers. In addition, certain
underwriting practices that could lead to exclusion and that are applied
only to the smallest firms result in lower levels of coverage.
Except in Tucson, approximately half of the firms with two to five
full-time workers offer health insurance. The provision of employer-
based group health insurance is much more common among the larger
firms, with a notable jump in the percentage offering insurance occur-
ring at six workers in Denver and at ten workers in Tucson and Flint,
and a steady increase noted in Tampa.
The relatively high level of coverage in Denver for firms with ten to
twenty-five workers most likely reflects different work force and industry
composition. Denver ranks second in the nation for median number of
school years completed by its residents and has 64 percent more college
graduates than the U.S. average.5 This may mean that the expectation
for nonwage benefits is higher. The average firm in Denver also earned a
higher revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee (Exhibit 3).

We grouped firms by number of full-time workers. In part, this defini-
tion of firm size corresponds to health insurers' reluctance to cover
part-time workers. With only one exception, the fifty-four health insur-
ance companies we interviewed restricted benefit availability to full-
time employees, usually defined as those working at least thirty hours a
week. We found that anywhere from 10 percent to more than 50 percent
of small-firm employees are part-time workers, with those firms not
offering health insurance having, on average, twice as high a proportion
of part-time workers as those that do offer insurance (Exhibit 4).
Not surprisingly, larger, wealthier, and older firms were more likely to
offer health insurance. Firms offering health insurance were also more
likely to offer other fringe benefits and pay higher wages. Clearly, a lot of
these firm characteristics go together. In general, older firms are larger
and gross higher revenue. However, most of these individual effects held
up in logistic regression analyses. Gross revenue per employee, size, and
proportion of full-time workers were all statistically significant determi-
nants of the probability of a firm's offering health insurance.6
Participants. The foundation-sponsored plans appear to have at-
tracted firms that are, on average, slightly smaller, younger, and poorer
than those firms that offered other forms of health insurance. In fact, the
participant firms were younger than either of the comparison groups--
those with insurance and those without (Exhibit 5). With one excep-
tion, they also had a lower revenue per FTE employee (Exhibit 3).

both the size and age distributions were very similar. Relative to firms
offering other health insurance, the participating firms were more likely
to gross lower revenues per FTE employee, with two to four times as large
a proportion grossing less than $30,000 and one-half to one-third as
many grossing over $90,000 per full-time employee. As with size and
age, the distribution of participating firms with respect to revenue per
FTE employee was close to that of firms without insurance.
The exception to this pattern is Denver, where two kinds of partici-
pant firms exist: those that did not offer insurance at time of enrollment
in the foundation-sponsored plan, and those that did and were merely
switching to a different, perhaps lower-cost, plan. Denver was the only
program site that allowed currently insured firms to enroll in the spon-
sored plan. Approximately 40 percent of the Denver participants were
insured at the time they enrolled in the foundation-sponsored plan.

switching were older and wealthier than those without insurance at time
of enrollment. One-fourth of the newly covered firms in Denver had
been in operation only one or two years at the time of the survey,
compared with only 7 percent of those switching. Almost 30 percent of
the participants without prior coverage reported gross revenues of less
than $30,000 per FTE employee. Only 15 percent of the participants
changing carriers were in this bottom revenue group. The newly covered
firms were also significantly smaller (Exhibit 4). Given the relationship
between age, size, and gross revenue of firms, it is possible that in a few
years both groups of Denver participants will more closely resemble the
firms with other sources of health insurance.
Over half of the participating firms in Tucson, Tampa, and Flint
reported changing carriers in the past three years. So, although firms
currently offering health insurance were not eligible to enroll in the
foundation program, most of them had offered a plan in the recent past.
Only 20 percent of the firms without health insurance at the time of the
survey reported having previously offered a plan. Even though the two
groups of firms appear similar in terms of size, age, and revenue, there are
clearly differences in either the ability of the firm to obtain health
insurance or in employer or employee preferences regarding insurance.
Except in Flint, employees of participating firms earned, on average,
higher wages than employees of firms not offering health insurance and
lower wages than employees of firms that offer other health insurance
(Exhibit 6). The difference in Flint most likely reflects the program's
target population: small businesses that employed a former Medicaid or

marketing this foundation-sponsored health insurance plan.
There were slight differences in the personal characteristics of em-
ployees in these groups of firms. A significantly larger percentage of
employees of firms offering non-foundation-sponsored health insurance
had worked for that firm for more than three years, and a significantly
smaller percentage had worked for the firm for less than one year.
Reflecting the relatively young age of the participant firm, a smaller
percentage of the employees of these firms had worked more than three
years than was the case in either of the other two groups. Employees of
firms that do not offer health insurance were more likely to be part-time
workers and, except in Flint, to be hourly workers. While an employee
of a firm in Tucson that did not offer health insurance was more likely to
be a young, single man, there were no clear patterns in the other sites
with respect to age or marital status of the worker, nor the proportion of
men or women.
Approximately three-fourths of employers, both participant firms and
firms offering other insurance, cited the need to attract and keep em-
ployees as an important reason for offering insurance. Almost half of the
employers said that a sick employer, employee, or a family member of the
employer or an employee was an important reason why they decided to
offer health insurance. Except in Tampa, approximately one-third more
participant firms cited this as an important reason than firms offering
other insurance. The reverse was true in Tampa.
Policy Implications
To understand the kinds of firms responding to the Health Care for
the Uninsured Program initiative, we need to divide them into two
groups: those that offered health insurance in the recent past, and new
entrants into the market. Those that previously offered health insurance
looked very much like the comparison firms, in both firm and employee
characteristics. Why they dropped their previous insurance or why they
switched to the foundation-sponsored plan is not clear. Most mentioned
large premium increases or dissatisfaction with the previous insurer as
reasons for dropping coverage, and two-thirds said that finding an afford-
able plan was an important reason for offering the foundation-sponsored
plan. However, the importance of price in decision making was no
different for the firms that offered other insurance.
Most of the Health Care for the Uninsured Program projects have
found a small niche in the previously uninsured market--firms that are,
on average, smaller and younger with relatively low revenue but with
expectations of growing richer and with higher-paid employees who

SHORTCOMINGS OF VOLUNTARISM 39
expect such benefits as health insurance. It is possible that the main
barrier to obtaining insurance faced by these participating firms was
their relatively young age. In time, these firms may grow to resemble the
firms that had health insurance coverage from other sources.
Whichever group we examine, the market shares of the foundation-
sponsored plans are quite small. The largest share is in Tampa, where we
estimate that approximately 17 percent of the firms with two to twenty-
five employees that did not have health insurance enrolled in the
Florida Health Access Corporation plan. The other three sites achieved
much lower shares, ranging from 2 to 5 percent.
These low rates are consistent with the low penetration rates esti-
mated by Ken Thorpe and colleagues in the Brooklyn and Albany pilot
studies.7 In all cases, the premiums were subsidized; there were not many
takers. There are obviously many possible reasons, including offering
what is perceived as an undesirable package (for example, the Arizona
Health Care Group uses HMOs under contract with the state's Medicaid
program, in contrast to Florida's offer of an established and respected
HMO at a heavily subsidized price; the SCOPE plan in Denver has a
very high copayment), insufficient or ineffective marketing to potential
enrollees, and premiums that remain "too high."8
Our results give some additional insight into why so many small firms
do not offer insurance. For example, because of certain insurance indus-
try underwriting practices, specific businesses may have difficulty finding
insurance products. Our survey of insurers found systematic exclusions of
certain businesses.9 Other insurers will cover these industries, but they
add a substantial (as high as 50 percent) surcharge to the usual premium.
Another gap in coverage exists for part-time workers. Our results
indicate that businesses with a larger proportion of full-time workers are
more likely to offer health insurance. In addition, the percentage of
full-time workers with employment-based health insurance was two to
three times greater than the percentage of their insured counterparts
working fewer than thirty hours a week.
We also found that there is a fairly hard-core group of small-business
owners who do not want to provide health insurance benefits to their
employees. Almost half of the employers in our survey who do not offer
health insurance indicated that they were not interested in doing so.
Usually these employers state that this lack of coverage reflects a lack of
demand on the part of their employees, that they can recruit employees
without it, and that most of their employees are covered elsewhere.
Without doubt, however, cost is the primary reason given for why these
employers do not offer health insurance. Many were as concerned about
the rapid increase in premiums as with their current level, often citing

40 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Summer 1992
doubling of premiums after one or two years of initial enrollment.
The Health Care for the Uninsured Program spawned several interest-
ing projects that reduced the number of working uninsured in these four
sites. For the younger firms that enrolled, coverage probably came
sooner than would otherwise have been the case. Whether some of the
other firms would have had access to or found other affordable plans is
not clear. What is clear is that the impact of this relatively small
private/public-sector initiative was fairly limited. Larger efforts are called
for if we want to make significant reductions in the number of people
who lack health insurance coverage.
NOTES
1. For more on these projects, see W.D. Helms, A.K. Gauthier, and D.M. Campion,
"Mending the Flaws in the Small-Group Market," in this volume of Health Affairs.
2. The nine Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-sponsored projects that eventually en-
rolled participant firms are located in Appleton, Wisconsin; Tucson and Phoenix,
Arizona; Birmingham, Alabama; Denver/Boulder CMSA, Ft. Collins, and Colorado
Springs, Colorado; Tampa/St. Petersburg/Clearwater MSA and rural Tallahassee, Flor-
ida; Bath/Brunswick and Skowhegan/Somerset, Maine; Memphis, Tennessee; Flint and
Marquette, Michigan; and Salt Lake City, Utah.
3. Steve Heeringa at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research is prepar-
ing a final technical memorandum on the differences between the DMI and the ES-202
sample frames. He reports that the only significant difference between the two frames
is that more sampled businesses on the DMI frame are unreachable or out of business
than are the sampled businesses from the ES-202 data.
4. For the most part, there have been only three national studies since 1980 that report
information on small businesses and health benefits: ( 1 ) a mail survey conducted by
ICF, Inc., for the Small Business Administration (ICF/SBA) in 1987; (2) a mail survey
conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) in 1989; and
(3) a telephone survey undertaken by the Health Insurance Association of America
(HIAA) in 1989. The ICF/SBA study reported an overall response rate of 20 percent
(with 45 percent of their sample representing employers with more than 100 employ-
ees); the response rate for the NFIB study was 29 percent (3 percent of the NFIB
sample--which was drawn from their membership list--contained businesses with
more than 100 employees); and HIAA had an overall 66 percent response rate (59
percent of the HIAA sample comprised businesses with more than 100 employees).

significant determinants in their study of small businesses. See K. Thorpe et al.,
