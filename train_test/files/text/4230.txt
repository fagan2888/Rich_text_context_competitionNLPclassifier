Translating new
knowledge into practices:
reconceptualising stroke as
an emergency condition
Stephanie J Snow
Abstract
Objectives: To examine how the new concept of stroke as an emergency condition led to the
development of new clinical pathways for stroke patients in Newcastle Upon Tyne, implemented
through protocols which were then rapidly adopted across the UK and further afield.
Methods: Historical analysis using health policy documents, published papers and correspond-
ence on stroke alongside 17 interviews with stroke clinicians and managers in the UK and the US.
Results: The challenges of implementation stemmed from organisational and professional barriers
rather than scientific or technological difficulties. Stroke's historical status as a non-treatable illness
was a barrier to the adoption of acute treatments. Building new pathways for stroke patients by
developing protocols for paramedics and emergency room staff originated as a local solution to a
local problem but were taken up widely.
Discussion: Understanding the clinical response to the reconceptualisation of stroke as a
treatable disease contributes to our understandings of the relations between clinical research and
practice. These findings have implications for how we understand the translation of new knowledge
into practice and its transfer across different clinical communities and settings. Protocols are
shown to be a particularly valuable tool, bridging knowledge between communities and manifesting
a new identity for stroke.

which there was no acute treatment. In the
mid-1990s the successful trials of tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA), a clot-busting
drug, established tPA as the first acute
treatment for ischaemic stroke which offered
significant improvements in outcomes and
complete cure for some patients.2 However,
its use is dependent on an appropriate
diagnosis being made within 3 h of the
onset of stroke and subsequent trials have
confirmed that time to treatment is the key
to good outcomes.3 These new paradigms of
treatment have generated new clinical and
service models for the treatment of stroke
worldwide. Here I draw on documents and
interviews with clinicians and managers to
analyse the development of an acute stroke
service in Newcastle Upon Tyne in the
North East of England and the introduction
of tPA into practice. I show how new
pathways for stroke patients were created
through protocols for paramedics and emer-
gency room staff and suggest the findings
have implications for our understanding of
the translation of new knowledge into prac-
tices and its transfer across clinical
communities.
Methods
The evidence employed here arises from an
ongoing broader historical study, which is
exploring how and why the understanding,
research, diagnosis, treatment and experi-
ence of stroke has changed over the past 60
years. It uses documentary sources such as
health policy documents, published papers
and correspondence on stroke together with
17 interviews with stroke physicians, neur-
ologists, managers and patient activists in
the UK and the US. Oral history was used as
a tool to reconstruct participants' responses
to the new understandings of stroke, partly
because it is the most sensitive method of
exploring experiences of work4,5 and is
especially suited to revealing how local net-
works, relationships, and communication
pathways underpin medical practice at
local level.6 Manchester Local Research
Ethics Committee decided that formal
NHS approval was not required.
Permission was sought to audio-record and
fully transcribe the interviews.
Results
The evidence shows that the challenges of
implementing the new paradigms of practice
which are contingent on conceptualising
stroke as an emergency condition have
stemmed from organisational and profes-
sional barriers rather than scientific or
technological difficulties. The difficulties
experienced by clinicians attempting to
establish an acute stroke service at the
Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne
originated from multiple sources: stroke's
historical status as a non-treatable illness
which was primarily suffered by older
patients; local configurations of emergency
services; and inter-professional disputes
about the ownership of patients. The multi-
disciplinary stroke team built new pathways
for stroke patients across the city by design-
ing protocols for paramedics and emergency
room staff to improve the diagnostic accur-
acy of stroke in the various settings and the
rapid triaging of patients to the acute stroke
service. The Newcastle Upon Tyne experi-
ence is not unique but is illustrative of the
barriers stroke clinicians have encountered
worldwide when setting up acute thromb-
olysis services. It is not surprising then that
the Newcastle Upon Tyne stroke protocols
which were developed as a local solution to a
local problem were adopted nationally and
disseminated further afield. My analysis
explores first the way in which stroke was
reconceptualised during the 1990s as an
emergency condition then moves to the
establishment of stroke services, the creation
of the protocols, and the dynamics of the
Newcastle Upon Tyne setting, which shaped
their final form. The protocols, I suggest,
192 Chronic Illness 9(3)
bridged knowledge and practices between
the different clinical communities prompting
actors to channel acute stroke patients on to
new pathways. Finally I argue that the
adoption of protocols for acute stroke in
many parts of the world says much about the
broader characteristics of contemporary
medicine as well playing a highly significant
role in reconceptualising stroke as an emer-
gency condition.
New paradigms for stroke
In high and middle income countries stroke
is the second leading cause of death and the
World Health Organisation predicts that
heart disease and stroke will remain the
single leading causes of death globally for
several decades to come.7 The onset of a
stroke can be rapid, with symptoms occur-
ring without warning; clinically it is defined
as `acute neurological dysfunction usually
due to a pathological process in blood
vessels'.8 The commonest cause of stroke ­
around 90% of cases ­ is through ischaemia,
where a clot prevents blood reaching a
cerebral vessel and causes cell death. For
the first half of the 20th-century physicians
treated stroke patients by practising `mas-
terly inactivity' or `skilful neglect'.9 Stroke
was understood to be a terminal although
protracted disease process.10 But in the
1950s in parallel with the growing use of
anticoagulants, enzymes such as fibrinoly-
sin, and hypotensive drugs, specialist stroke
units were developed from within depart-
ments of geriatric medicine. These were
generally non-acute services and offered a
range of rehabilitative therapies including
physiotherapy and speech and language
therapy.11 A few studies suggested organis-
ing stroke services in these configurations
could help stroke patients achieve the max-
imum return to functionality.11 In the US,
some intensive care units for stroke patients
were set up but these seemed to have little
significant impact on mortality and
morbidity and this type of unit dwindled
from the 1970s onwards.12 By the 1980s, new
models of care emerged which focused on
rehabilitating patients from the earliest
days, sometimes in designated stroke units
and sometimes through mobile stroke
teams.11 Nevertheless in 1988 a King's
Fund Forum on stroke drew attention to
the poor quality of services in relation to
both the organisation and therapeutic
treatments.
The services that are provided in hospital,
primary care, and the community seem
haphazard, fragmented, and poorly tai-
lored to patients' needs, and there is a
striking lack of convincing data on the
effectiveness of widely used medical, psy-
chological, and specific rehabilitative
treatments.13
Stroke was not therefore considered to be
an acute condition requiring emergency
treatment, nor indeed did it necessarily
result in hospital admission.
But during the early 1990s, the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke (NINDS) in the US carried out
trials of the use of tPA in eight university
medical centres and around 40 hospitals
countrywide. NINDS researchers were
called in to all stroke patients to treat them
as acute emergencies using tPA and a
placebo. Laboratory work had confirmed
that tPA could restore blood flow and limit
cell loss but there was a significant risk of
cerebral haemorrhage which had been a
major and frequent complication of earlier
trials with thrombolytic therapies. The idea
of using drugs to dissolve the clot came from
cardiology. Thrombolytic agents had been
used to treat acute myocardial infarction
since the late 1950s and by the 1980s were
the primary treatment option.14 Treating
acute stroke in an equivalent fashion `made
sense; it's working in the heart, it should
work on the brain', said Patricia Grady who
was Deputy and Acting Director of NINDS
Snow 193
in the early 1990s. But the context of the
brain was very different to that of the heart
and made the implementation of thromb-
olysis `really tricky and very exciting'.
Whereas the heart had one terminal artery
the brain had four vessels and although in
most drug trials `if you're giving a drug you
can withdraw the drug, this one . . . you
can't take it back', noted Grady.a John
Marler, the neurologist who designed the
NINDS trials, commented that the most
difficult clinical aspect of tPA was its
potency to do `harm in a time measured in
minutes' and so the challenge had been to
build a trial that enabled tPA to demon-
strate its full potential whilst limiting its
risks.b The trials were therefore set up for
tPA to be administered in very tight time-
frames of 90 and 180 min of the onset of
stroke to reduce the risk of haemorrhage, as
well as maximise the potential for recovery.2
`Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Acute
Ischaemic Stroke' was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine in December
1995 accompanied by a major press confer-
ence and, for the first time in the history of
stroke, provided evidence of the effective-
ness of an emergency treatment during its
acute stage. When those involved in the
trials gathered to see the results of the
statistical analysis, it was, said Mike Welch
who had been in charge of the study's
Coordinating Centre in Detroit, `a remark-
able moment, the first time ever that any-
thing had ever proven to be effective for
acute stroke'.15 `You just know you're in a
moment that's a paradigm change', noted
Patrick Lyden, the principal investigator in
Virginia.15 The approval of tPA was a
`wake-up call' to the established patterns of
`therapeutic nihilism' that dominated the
treatment of stroke patients, wrote Louis R
Caplan, Professor of Neurology at Harvard
Medical School in 2008.16 Nevertheless, the
introduction of tPA into practice has proved
controversial as suggested by current statis-
tics: only 2­5% of acute stroke patients are
treated with the new treatments; less than
15­40% of patients arrive at emergency
centres within the timeframe.17 Many of
the difficulties as we shall see through the
Newcastle Upon Tyne exemplar have arisen
from organisational and professional bar-
riers rather than scientific or technological
problems.
tPA was a simple treatment. The dose,
based on a patient's body weight, was
administered by injection and intravenous
drip. The clinical diagnosis was determined
through patient history, observation and
examination and used established technol-
ogy ­ computerised tomography (CT) scan-
ning. Scanning provided visual images of the
brain's soft tissue that could definitively
diagnose whether the stroke was ischaemic
or haemorrhagic. tPA, of course, was
licensed only for use in ischaemic strokes
because of the risks of it exacerbating
bleeding. The treatment could produce dra-
matic results within hours of its administra-
tion and the NINDS trials had shown how
long-term outcomes were improved by its
use. But tPA was only licensed for use within
3 h of the onset of stroke which meant that
there was a very tight timeframe in which to
achieve clinical diagnosis of ischaemic
stroke confirmed by scanning. Diagnosis
was not an easy clinical task, even for
those with experience:
`stroke has protean manifestations and
differentiation of stroke mimics in the
hyperacute setting can be challenging
even for experienced vascular neurologists
and stroke physicians'.18

centre and be diagnosed and treated within a

few hours of the onset of stroke provoked
disbelief amongst clinicians worldwide.
Accustomed to thinking of stroke patients
as non-acute cases, clinicians struggled to
reconstruct stroke within the parameters of
time-driven urgency and the high tech inter-
ventions usually associated with dramatic
medical emergencies such as heart attacks or
road traffic accidents. The idea of treating
stroke within 60 min of the onset of symp-
toms was deemed `crazy' by most neurolo-
gists, recalled Marler (see footnote b). The
difficulties have their roots in the long-held
concepts of stroke as a terminal although
protracted illness from which there is no
respite and stroke's associations with geri-
atric medicine which has always had low
medical status. They were also driven by the
culture of neurology which was not prac-
tised as an acute specialty. Rafael Llinas,
Associate Professor of Neurology, Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine
was a resident in neurology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA in the
mid-1990s. He explained that:
Most of the great neurologists of that time
[pre-tPA] were diagnosticians; this is where
the lesion is, this is the aphasia . . . people
come in with a stroke and they would see
them three or four days later and they
would pour over them for an hour and
very, very quickly it became from that to -
you have to come, you have to come right
now, you have to come in 15 minutes . . . in
the middle of the night . . . you have to
make a decision and . . . it's an entirely
different culture [post-tPA].c
The way in which tPA was set to funda-
mentally change neurological practice was
augured during the trials. Marler recalled
being thanked by a nurse who worked in one
of the tPA trial emergency centres: `Well,'
she said, `you've made our job so much more
fun. First of all we see the neurologists in the
emergency room when we've never seen
them before, and second we see them move
so quickly' (see footnote b). And over recent
years some clinicians have begun to refer to
stroke as `brain attack' in order to encour-
age the same cultural responses that are
embedded in medical and social structures
for heart attacks. In essence the challenge
presented by tPA was not one of technical or
scientific complexity, but in getting the right
patient to the right place for treatment
within the timeframe.
In the UK, Professor Gary Ford, stroke
physician in Newcastle Upon Tyne, remem-
bered reading the NINDS trials results
showing tPA was effective and thinking:
`this is of no relevance to the NHS, we can't
implement it'.d However, as we shall see
now, Ford did indeed become an early
adopter of thrombolysis, developing an
acute stroke service and creating new stand-
ards for practice.
Stroke services in Newcastle Upon Tyne
Gary Ford had trained in geriatrics and
clinical pharmacology and when he became
a senior lecturer in Newcastle Upon Tyne in
1992, with a clinical position at the Freeman
Hospital, he set up a stroke service encom-
passing research as well as clinical practice.
At the time there were no models of acute
stroke services but he surmised that in view
of the new neuroprotective drugs then being
developed for stroke, acute stroke units may
well become the models for the future. The
service began in a very low-key way: `we just
decided we'd put all the acute strokes on one
ward' (see footnote d). Over the next few
years Ford acquired an offsite ward and
allocated half the beds to stroke rehabilita-
tion patients. Stroke patients were all
referred by their general practitioners

(GPs) as the Freeman Hospital had no
Accident and Emergency (A&E) depart-
ment. Local A&E services were situated at
the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI), a few
miles away from the Freeman. At this point
­ pre-announcement of the tPA trial results
­ acute stroke patients were defined as those
who had suffered a stroke in the last seven
days.11 In specialist units like the one set up
by Ford, CT scanning was one of the
assessment tools but Ford had found it
difficult to establish scanning as part of the
routine treatment: `we could barely get scans
on everybody and . . . [nobody] had a scan,
you know, within an hour'.19 It was the
difficulties experienced by Ford in setting up
his stroke service which informed his imme-
diate reaction to the announcement of tPA
that it would be impossible to implement a
new treatment which required such a tight
timeframe for its administration. Indeed,
Ford may well not have pursued the poten-
tial of tPA without the intervention of Jo
Harbison, Ford's registrar of the time who
had a keen interest in stroke.e Harbison
suggested: `you should get the ambulances
just to bring the stroke patients to . . . the
Freeman Hospital directly'. This, said Ford,
`was a simple thing to say but actually not
that easy to do'. Ford discussed the matter
with the Chief Executive of the Ambulance
Service for North East Northumbria and in
1997 they established a rapid ambulance
protocol enabling paramedics to take poten-
tial stroke patients directly to the Freeman
Hospital's acute assessment area where there
was an on-call stroke nurse, rather than to
the A&E department of the RVI.20
However, this provoked much local
resistance.
there was a lot of opposition to that. . . . my
physician colleagues . . . in the Freeman
Hospital thought this was a really bad
thing because they thought the paramedics
would bring all sorts of stroke patients,
old ladies falling over . . . so they were anti
it. . . . colleagues at the other hos-
pitals . . . didn't have a stroke unit or
stroke service . . . they were opposed to
it . . . they thought they were not going to
get patients, and the neighbouring trust in
North Tyneside immediately wrote a let-
ter . . . stating under no circumstances
should any patient in North Tyneside be
directed to the Freeman Hospital. So there
was a lot of opposition . . . which is a gen-
eral feature of innovation in the NHS
actually (see footnote d).
It is perhaps useful to add here that these
pressures were in part driven by the new
arrangements for the NHS which had
created a quasi-market in 1991 which
involved the separation of purchasers and
providers of care. Hospitals became inde-
pendent Trusts and were not guaranteed
funding but had to compete with other
providers, including non-local Trusts and
private hospitals for contracts.21 Thus
although the opposition to Ford's plan was
driven by persistence of historical attitudes
to stroke patients and their treatment, it was
also exacerbated by the wider tensions in
health service organisation.
Initially only two or three stroke patients
a month were brought to Ford's service but
numbers increased after Ford wrote directly
to paramedics and reassured them that there
was no problem if they brought a patient
who turned out not to have a stroke (see
footnote d). After the first 15 months a
review showed that 84% of patients
admitted via the rapid ambulance protocol
had a confirmed diagnosis of acute stroke or
transient ischaemic attack (TIA).20 As
Harbison et al. pointed out in their report
to the Lancet, the protocol had been estab-
lished without additional training for

paramedics (i.e. little additional costs had
been required) and yet had proved remark-
ably effective. During this period, Newcastle
Upon Tyne was one of only two centres in
the UK using the new therapies. In many
other centres, the fact that tPA had not yet
been licensed in Europe created too many
uncertainties for physicians to implement it.f
Face, arm, speech test
Ford's direct engagement with the
Emergency Services caused him to think
more deeply about the critical role served
by paramedics in the case of stroke
patients: `they could potentially in the
long run be giving drugs in the ambulance'
(see footnote d). A pharmaceutical com-
pany, Janssen Cilag, interested in market-
ing thrombolytic drugs, agreed to fund the
development of a diagnostic stroke instru-
ment for paramedics and a promotional
educational video. In 1998 Ford drew
together a small group of stroke and
A&E physicians and ambulance personnel
and together they undertook:
`a quick review of what was out there and
we came across the Los Angeles paramedic
stroke scale and the Cincinnati . . . stroke
recognition instrument. We basically did a
minor modification to the Cincinnati
instrument . . . adding in a GCS (Glasgow
Coma Scale)' (see footnote d).
The purpose of the Newcastle Face Arm
Speech Test (FAST) was to allow the rapid
diagnosis of potential stroke patients by
paramedics. The group designed FAST to
integrate easily into existing assessment
procedures used by emergency services
such as the Glasgow Coma Scale. It con-
tained three key elements: facial weakness,
arm weakness and speech disturbance and
these were incorporated into the ambulance
report form used universally.22 To promote
FAST, the group also produced a training
package for paramedics which was distrib-
uted to ambulance staff in Newcastle Upon
Tyne and incorporated into the training
programme for new recruits in 1998­1999.
A prospective study of the acute stroke
service at the Freeman Hospital in 2000
produced evidence that paramedics using
FAST had achieved high levels of detection
and diagnostic accuracy of stroke. FAST
did not require paramedics to acquire new
knowledge but rather to focus their existing
knowledge on the key elements of stroke in
order to differentiate their response to stroke
patients from other emergency patients.
FAST was notable for showing how
within the structures of the NHS, para-
medics could effectively redirect patients to
stroke centres. It also illustrated the way in
which local configurations of A&E services
around Newcastle Upon Tyne drove much
of Ford and his team's work: `In other
places it was never so critical because the
patients would be coming anyway' (see
footnote d). FAST was developed to address
the specific problems in Newcastle Upon
Tyne yet it was later taken up as a diagnostic
tool by many stroke guideline producers
including the European Stroke Association
and the American Stroke Association.19 The
local context of Newcastle Upon Tyne was
to trigger the development of a further
protocol for use in the emergency room in
the early 2000s.
Recognition of stroke in the emergency
room
The 2000 prospective study, as well as
confirming the effectiveness of FAST for
paramedics, revealed that referrals to the
acute stroke service from other health pro-
fessionals, specifically GPs and A&E doc-
tors, had around a 30% misdiagnosis rate.
To address this issue Ford and his team

tPA was licensed in Europe in 2002.

decided to develop a specific stroke recog-
nition tool for use by staff in the Emergency
Room (ER) with the aim of improving the
accuracy of stroke diagnosis. Thus ROSIER
originated as a solution to a particular local
problem. The development process under-
taken by Ford et al. illustrates not just how
tightly medical practice has become inter-
twined with scientific evidence over the
recent past but also the continuing priority
accorded to clinical observations and what
may be termed as `tacit' knowledge.
Work began by collecting data over a
12-month period on patient referrals to the
acute stroke service from the ER. On
arrival at the acute stroke unit patients
were clinically assessed by a research neur-
ologist who was qualified in the use of the
US National Institutes of Health Stroke
Scale (NIHSS), or by the on call registrar
or consultant. At the time of the clinical
examination, no access was given to ima-
ging results or stroke team diagnoses. This
first phase focused on creating data on
stroke and non-stroke patients' character-
istics and evaluating these against the
literature so as to produce a set of
standardised signs and symptoms which
together formed a diagnostic profile for
stroke patients. A combination of variables
from this diagnostic profile was then
chosen for the one-page proforma with a
scoring system for each symptom or sign.
Prospective stroke patients were to be
scored on seven items consisting of clinical
history (loss of consciousness, convulsive
fits) and neurological signs (face, arm or
leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual
field defect). Scoring was simple and `Yes'
or `No' were the only responses available
thus allowing only quantifiable information
to be recorded. The proforma also
included basic demographic details, blood
pressure and blood glucose concentrations
­ the latter to ensure early identification of
hypoglycaemia, a potential stroke mimic.
Here then, the process of standardisation
meshed clinical observations and scientific
evidence to produce a form which gave a
numerical score. That numerical score
represented the clinical diagnosis.
Yet although the form's design ensured
that it collected only quantitative data and
numerical scores, the process of its design
incorporated softer elements such as taking
account of the implicit routines and prac-
tices of the ER. In other words the setting in
which the scale was to be used was instru-
mental in shaping its design. For example,
knowing that the ER was a very busy and
crowded environment meant that Ford and
his team consciously avoided:
`selecting items that are difficult to
assess . . . such as confusion and gait
or limb ataxia. Due attention to the
instrument's clinical use by ER staff was
one of our primary concerns'.18
The implementation of ROSIER into ER
practice was supported by special teaching
sessions for ER staff during which Ford and
his team obtained feedback on the use of the
scale in practice and refined it accordingly.
Assessment of eye movement abnormalities
for example, was not included because
junior ER staff had raised concerns about
the `ease of eliciting these signs' although
later analysis suggested that including this
sign would have detected a further two of
101 stroke cases.18
The scale had limitations and the pro-
forma warned that a score of 0 in some
patients did not mean that a diagnosis of
stroke could be dismissed completely.
Patients suffering cerebellar strokes for
example displayed no motor weakness, one
of the key measures on the scale, and were
therefore particularly unlikely to be recog-
nised.23 This illustrates the difficulties in
bureaucratising medical practice to the
extreme. Nevertheless, implementing
ROSIER at the Freeman Hospital suc-
ceeded in improving diagnostic rates of ER
staff to more than 90% of possible stroke
198 Chronic Illness 9(3)
patients. ROSIER was welcomed widely by
the stroke community.
The ROSIER scale is an important step
forward . . . Nor and colleagues deserve
praise for developing a well-designed,
robust instrument . . . ROSIER represents
a further step along the road to optimum
stroke care ­ with only 1­2% patients in
our leading centres receiving thrombolytic
treatment, there is still a long way to go.24
ROSIER's legitimacy in the UK was
sealed when it was implemented nationally
through the 2007 Stroke Strategy and
included in the National Institute for
Clinical Excellence guideline on acute
stroke and TIA.25 It has since become one
of the best-known screening tools for diag-
nosing stroke in the ER and clinical guide-
lines on the management of acute stroke in
many parts of the world including some of
Europe, the US, Australia and China rec-
ommend its use.26
Discussion
In summary, the paradigmatic shift to
treating stroke acutely, established by the
1995 NINDS trials, created new conceptions
of stroke as an emergency condition. The
difficulties of implementing tPA say much
about the inherent tensions engendered by
the global application of new knowledge in
early 21st-century medicine. These are gen-
erated as much by the size and complexity of
health service organisations and the multi-
plicity of clinical specialties and practi-
tioners as by the nature of the knowledge
itself. There is no `easy strategy' for equili-
brating the `generalised truth' generated
through laboratory science and randomised
control trials into medical settings and
communities shaped through the specifici-
ties of time and place.27 That Ford and his
team chose to establish new pathways for
acute stroke patients in Newcastle Upon
Tyne through the development of protocols
reflects one of contemporary medicine's
strongest characteristics: the standardisa-
tion of medical routines and practices
through the production of evidence-based
protocols/guidelines which has been part of
medicine since the 1970s and is now `ubi-
quitous'.21 The rise and spread of these
instruments has been one of the strategies
employed to tackle some of the most thorny
issues in recent decades: economic savings in
the face of soaring health costs; the preser-
vation of professional autonomy; and the
assertion of order and coherence over an
expanding and increasingly diverse medical
domain.28,29
The purpose of the Newcastle Upon Tyne
protocols was to translate the new evidence-
based therapy of tPA into practice. As
discussed earlier, the barriers to establishing
stroke as an acute emergency condition were
multiple and some were contingent on the
local arrangements for emergency services in
Newcastle Upon Tyne. The protocols
proved to be a powerful bridging mechanism
for transferring specialist knowledge and
practices from the specialist stroke team to
other communities within emergency care
services. Ford and his team standardised the
stroke diagnostic process by combining
objective and subjective sources of know-
ledge and taking the implicit routines, prac-
tices and sensibilities of paramedics and ER
staff into account. Specialist knowledge was
distilled into the protocols in a meaningful
form for the actors involved and promoted
new responses. Notably the protocols did
not require actors to develop new know-
ledge, but rather led them to use their
existing knowledge in a new way and to
respond differently if a positive diagnosis of
stroke occurred by sending the patient to the
acute stroke service as rapidly as possible.
Stroke services in Newcastle Upon Tyne
may well have developed differently if
the Freeman Hospital had had its own
emergency department, or if Ford had not
succeeded in building strong working
Snow 199
relationships with the paramedics. The
protocols were a local solution to a local
problem. Nevertheless, the swift take-up of
FAST and ROSIER as new standards in
stroke strategies in many parts of the world
suggest they offered a universal solution to
diagnostic and organisational dilemmas
around stroke.
The adoption of protocols to manage
acute stroke can be explained in part
through the striking way in which the
meanings embedded in the protocols chal-
lenged historical attitudes and responses to
stroke. Persistent conceptions of stroke as a
non-urgent, non-treatable condition
mediated strongly against the introduction
of rapid triage systems for acute stroke
patients, not just in Newcastle Upon Tyne
but worldwide. We have seen how the
difficulties were exacerbated by inter-profes-
sional disputes and the culture of neurology.
But manifest in the protocols was a new
identity for acute stroke patients. For the
first time in the history of the specialty they
were cast as medical priorities within health
care services. No longer on the margins of
medicine, stroke was a condition that
charged the clinical community with swift
and decisive action. The protocols served as
a simple mechanistic device for re-routing a
particular group of patients through health
systems and were a highly effective means of
bridging knowledge across clinical commu-
nities. Most importantly, however, they
were a widespread declaration of the para-
digm shift in stroke medicine that had
resulted from the NINDS trials.
