The benefits of regular physical activity (PA) to children's and
adolescents' well-being are well-documented (Jimenez-Pavon,
Kelly, & Reilly, 2010; Timmons, Naylor, & Pfeiffer, 2007). It is
particularly important to establish an active style in early child-
hood because activity patterns acquired in this life period track
over time (Jackson et al., 2003). Yet, epidemiological studies
indicate that many preschool-aged children fail to meet the rec-
ommended PA levels (Hinkley, Salmon, Okely, Crawford, &
Hesketh, 2012b). Insufficient levels of PA have been found in
Western as well as Eastern countries (Hinkley et al., 2012b).
For example, only 16% of Hong Kong preschoolers have been
reported to engage in adequate amounts of PA when excluding
preschool physical education classes (Department of Health,
Hong Kong SAR, 2009). It is, thus, important to identify modi-
fiable factors that promote PA in early childhood (Hinkley,
Salmon, Okely, Crawford, & Hesketh, 2012a).
Social-ecologic models describe children's PA as develop-
ing within an ecological niche with the immediate home and
neighborhood environments playing a major role in this pro-
cess through the provision of opportunities or creation of barri-
ers for engagement in PA (Sallis & Glanz, 2009). Figure 1
depicts a simplified model of home and neighborhood environ-
mental influences on preschool-aged children's PA based on
socio-ecologic theories. Several studies have provided initial
support for elements of the proposed model. Specifically, pre-
schoolers' PA was found to be positively associated with time
spent outdoors (Kneeshaw-Price et al., 2013), access to places
for PA, and the availability of active-play equipment in the
neighborhood (Farley, Mariwether, Baker, Rice, & Webber,
2008; Potwarka, Kaczynski, & Flack, 2008). Conversely, there
is some evidence that passive-play equipment, such as video
games and computers, may have a negative effect on children's
PA by providing attractive and affordable opportunities for

Measures of Environmental Correlates
of Physical Activity for Urban Chinese
Preschool-Aged Children: Development
and Reliability

Abstract
We adapted/developed and examined the test­retest reliability and internal consistency of eight parent-report measures
of home and neighborhood environmental correlates of physical activity appropriate for Chinese preschool-aged children
and their parents/primary caregivers living in densely populated urban environments. This study consisted of a qualitative
(cognitive interviews) and a quantitative (test­retest reliability) component. Chinese versions of the measures were pilot-
tested on 20 parents of Hong Kong preschool-aged children using cognitive interviews. Measures were then administered
to 61 parents twice, 1 week apart. Test­retest reliability and internal consistency were computed. Except for two items, the
test­retest reliability of items and scale summary scores ranged from moderate to excellent. The internal consistency of the
measures exceeded recommended minimal values (Cronbach's  > .70). The parent-report measures examined in this study
are potentially appropriate for use in investigations of environmental correlates of the physical activity of Chinese preschool-
aged children living in densely populated urban environments. However, their predictive validity with respect to Chinese
preschool-aged children's physical activity needs to be assessed in future studies.

passive activities that replace more active pursuits (Ross,
Dowda, Saunders, & Pate, 2013).
The neighborhood environment can also affect children's
PA through its impact on parental perceptions of neighbor-
hood safety (Burdette, Whitaker, & Daniels, 2004; Carver,
Timperio, & Crawford, 2008; O'Connor et al., 2014; Suen,
Cerin, & Wu, 2015), including risk of crime (Burdette et al.,
2004; Suen et al., 2015), stranger danger (Carver et al., 2008;
Suen et al., 2015), risk of unintentional injury (Bruce, Lake,
Eden, & Denney, 2004), and traffic hazards (Bringolf-Isler et
al., 2010; Suen et al., 2015). In other words, parental safety
concerns based on unfavorable perceptions of the neighbor-
hood environment may lead to parental restrictions of active
play in the neighborhood. These safety concerns may be
buffered by higher levels of perceived community cohesion
(Durand, Dunton, Spruijt-Metz, & Pentz, 2012).
Relationships of neighborhood characteristics with pre-
school-aged children's PA depicted in Figure 1 are relatively
understudied and restricted to Western populations.
Consequently, they may not be applicable to populations of
parents and preschool-aged children living in other geo-
graphical locations and cultures, such as ultra-dense Chinese
metropolises which, unlike most Western cities, are typified
by high levels of air pollution and a shortage of appropriate
outdoor play space (Cerin, Chan, Macfarlane, Lee, & Lai,
2011). To study environment­PA behavior relationships in
preschool-aged children of ultra-dense Chinese metropo-
lises, relevant measures of environmental characteristics that
are culturally appropriate and specific to the target popula-
tion (Chinese parents and their preschool-aged children) are
needed. Although parent-report measures of aspects of the
neighborhood environment relevant to preschool-aged chil-
dren's PA are available in English, they have not been trans-
lated and validated/adapted for a Chinese population
(Hinkley et al., 2012a).
Thus, the aim of this study was to translate, adapt or
develop, and examine the reliability of parent-report mea-
sures of home and neighborhood environmental correlates of
preschool-aged children's PA appropriate for use with par-
ents/primary caregivers of preschool-aged children living in
Hong Kong, an ultra-dense Chinese metropolis (Cerin et al.,
2011). Specifically, we report on the translation/adaptation
and repeatability of measures of perceived (a) community
cohesion, (b) signs of physical and social disorder, (c) traffic
safety and pedestrian infrastructure, (d) stranger danger, (e)
availability of active-play equipment, (f) availability of pas-
sive-play equipment, and (g) places for child's PA(see Figure
1). We also report on a newly developed measure of per-
ceived risk of unintentional injury.
Method
This study consisted of a qualitative, adaptation stage involv-
ing cognitive interviews and refinement of measures trans-
lated from their English original versions into Chinese and a
quantitative, test­retest reliability stage.
Participants
In 2011-2012, two convenience samples of Chinese-speaking
parents/primary caregivers of Hong Kong preschool-aged
children were recruited from kindergartens, preschool play-
group centers, and Maternal Care and Health Clinics of the
Department of Health. Twenty participants participated in
the qualitative stage of the study, whereas 61 participants
participated in the quantitative, test­retest reliability stage of
the study. Inclusion criteria were being the parent/primary
caregiver of at least one 3- to 5 year-old Chinese-speaking
child living in Hong Kong. Exclusionary criteria were par-
ents/primary caregivers of children with a disease affecting
Suen et al. 3
their PA behavior or cognitive functioning and those who
were unable to read and write in Chinese. Eligible partici-
pants completed a demographic survey prior to participating
in the study. Table 1 reports the socio-demographic charac-
teristics of the samples.
Procedures
The study was approved by Human Research Ethics
Committee for Non-Clinical Faculties of the University of
Hong Kong #EA560310 and the Ethics Committee of the
Department of Health (Hong Kong SAR) # L/M 80/2011.
Informed consents were obtained from the participants prior
to data collection. In the qualitative stage of the study, the
original English versions of seven extant parent-report mea-
sures (see "Measures" section) included in this study were
reviewed by a panel of experts including two psychologists,
two researchers in public health, an exercise scientists, and a
pediatrician. In addition, the panel of experts originated five
items gauging perceived risk of unintentional injury in the
neighborhood. The English versions of the eight measures
were translated into Chinese, back-translated into English,
and re-reviewed by the panel of experts. This process resulted
into the Chinese working versions of the eight measures.
The Chinese working versions of the set of measures were
tested on a sample of Chinese-speaking parents of Hong
Kong preschool-aged children. Standardized cognitive inter-
views (~40 min each) examined participants' interpretations
of the items. The information gathered during these inter-
views was used to modify the wording of the items or add
new items (when necessary). The modified measures were
used in the test­retest reliability stage of the study. In the
quantitative stage (test­retest reliability) of the study, partici-
pants were asked to complete the Chinese version of the mea-
sures(firstassessmentT1).Themeasureswerere-administered
7 to 10 days following the first administration (T2).
Measures
Seven items from the Perceived Neighborhood Scale
(Martinez, 2000) were used to measure community cohesion.
The measure was originally devised to test the participants'
feelings of membership, trust, mutual influence, and shared
socio-emotion ties with neighbors. Respondents rated each
item using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The original scale was
found to have excellent reliability and validity (Martinez,
2000; Martinez, Black, & Starr, 2002) and internal consis-
tency (Cronbach's  = .85; Martinez et al., 2002). No sub-
stantive content changes were made to this scale by the panel
of experts or as a result of cognitive interviews.
Fourteen items measuring perceived signs of physical and
social disorder were taken from the Disorder Scale developed
by Coulton (Coulton, Korbin, & Su, 1996) and measuring per-
ceptions of deleterious conditions in the neighborhood that are
salient to caregivers of young children. Participants were
asked how frequently a particular event/condition occurred in
their neighborhood (e.g., How often do you see litter or trash
on the footpaths and streets in your neighborhood?) and pro-
vided responses on a 5-point frequency scale (from never to
frequently). Three new items were added to this measure, 2 of
which were suggested by a panel of experts (There are stray
dogs around and Public open spaces, parks, green/dirt strips
and sidewalks are not kept up) as they were deemed to repre-
sent relevant environmental hazards in some areas of Hong
Kong. One item was added as a result of the cognitive inter-
views (Burning joss sticks and paper). Cronbach's alpha of the
original measure was .95 (Coulton et al., 1996).
Perceived risk of unintentional injury in the neighborhood
was measured with a five-item scale constructed by the
above-mentioned panel of experts, including items related to
risk of injury due to stray animals; littered and disorderly
neighborhood streets, footpaths, or open spaces; falling
objects from high-rise buildings; and falls during play

(e.g., I'm afraid of my child being attacked by a dog or other
stray animals in my neighborhood). Respondents provided
their answers on a 4-point Likert-type scale.
To measure perceived neighborhood traffic safety and
pedestrian infrastructure, six items were taken from an
extant survey (Grow et al., 2008) and two items were sug-
gested by the panel of experts (The traffic makes it unsafe
for my child to play outdoors in my neighborhood and The
traffic makes it unsafe for my child to walk or ride a bike on
the road in my neighborhood). Respondents rated each item
on a 4-point Likert-type scale. The test­retest reliability of
the original items ranged from .28 to .73 (Joe, Carlson, &
Sallis, 2008).
Four measures were taken from the Neighborhood Impact
on Kids Survey (http://www.nikproject.org/index.htm).
Perceived stranger danger in the neighborhood was gauged
using 4 items rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale. No sub-
stantive, content changes were made to this scale by the
panel of experts or as a result of the cognitive interviews.
Test­retest reliability of these items in a previous study was
.87 (Rosenberg et al., 2009). Availability of active-play
equipment within or outside the neighborhood was assessed
using 8 items. Response options were at or around the home,
in the neighborhood (~15 min from home), and outside the
neighborhood. Test­retest reliability of these items ranged
from .53 to .85 (Joe et al., 2008). Seven items were used to
measure availability of passive-play equipment at home
(prior test­retest reliability intra-class correlation coefficient
[ICC] = .51-.96; Joe et al., 2008). Respondents were asked
how many of the listed functioning devices were available at
home (from 0 to more than 3). Places for child's PA in the
neighborhood (defined as an area 15-min walk from home)
were assessed using 11 out of 14 available items. Only items
deemed relevant to preschoolers were selected. The test­
retest reliability of the original items ranged from .42 to .85
(Joe et al., 2008).
Data Analyses
We computed the test­retest reliability of each item included
in the measures. Test­retest reliability of items with fre-
quency or Likert-type response scales were estimated using
ICCs based on absolute agreement two-way mixed effects
models. Responses of items gauging availability of active-
play equipment and places for child's PA were categorical.
Hence, their test­retest reliability was assessed using kappa
coefficients. ICCs and kappa coefficients .80 were consid-
ered excellent, values between .60 and .79 were considered
substantial, values between .40 and .59 moderate, and ICCs
< .40 were considered poor (Landis & Koch, 1977). Mean,
minimum and maximum item ICC or kappa coefficients
were computed for each measure with and without items
showing poor repeatability (ICC or kappa < .40).
We then computed means and standard deviations of sum-
mary scores of each measure for each of the two assessments.
The summary scores were based on items that showed an
acceptable level of repeatability (first step in the analyses).
We also computed the internal consistency (Cronbach's ) of
measures representing multi-item unidimensional scales
(e.g., community cohesion, perceived signs of social and
physical disorder, perceived risk of unintentional injury) for
each assessment. Cronbach's alphas exceeding .70 suggest
an acceptable level of internal consistency (Nunnally, 1978).
Finally, we estimated test­retest reliability (ICC) of the sum-
mary scores of each measure. Data were analyzed using the
SPSS statistical software package version 20.0.0.
Results
Participants tended to report relatively high levels of com-
munity cohesion, low levels of perceived signs of social and
physical disorder and moderate levels of perceived risk of
unintentional injury, traffic hazards, and stranger danger
(Table 3). The test­retest reliability of items gauging com-
munity cohesion was moderate. Item-specific test­retest
reliability of other measures ranged from moderate to sub-
stantial, with the exception of a poorly performing item
gauging perceived signs of physical and social disorder and
an item gauging perceived traffic safety and pedestrian
infrastructure (Table 2). The level of internal consistency of
the scales was acceptable (Table 3). Test­retest reliability of
the summary scores of the examined instruments ranged
from moderate to excellent, with the single-item perceived
traffic safety­not many cul-de-sacs showing the lowest test­
retest reliability and availability of passive-play equipment
the highest.
Discussion
We adapted and examined the reliability of seven extant par-
ent-report measures of home and neighborhood environmen-
tal correlates of young children's PA for use with Chinese
parents or primary caregivers of preschool-aged children liv-
ing in Hong Kong, a Chinese ultra-dense metropolis. We also
developed and examined the reliability of a new measure of
perceived risk of unintentional injury in the neighborhood
appropriate for the same target population.
Input from a multi-disciplinary panel of experts and par-
ents indicated that five out of seven extant measures did not
require any substantive changes to the items. These included
community cohesion, perceived stranger danger, places for
child's PA, and availability of passive and active-play equip-
ment. The first two measures describe, respectively, feelings
of community interconnectedness and parental protection of
children that may be common to all humans, regardless of
their cultural background, which would explain why no
amendments to the measures were suggested. As to the other
two measures, it appears that the types of play equipment and
places to play available to Hong Kong children are similar to
those found in Western countries. This is not surprising given
Suen et al. 5
that Hong Kong is a highly developed, global trade center
with a high level of availability of goods and facilities. This
situation is likely to be similar in other Chinese metropolises
(McKinsey Global Institute, 2012).
Two items were added to the extant measure of traffic
safety and pedestrian infrastructure, both of which depicted
situations of traffic hazards associated with parents prevent-
ing their children from engaging in PA outdoors. It was
deemed necessary to include these items because traffic vol-
ume and hazards are relatively high in Hong Kong (Cerin
et al., 2013), as they are in other Chinese cities (Pucher,
Peng, Mittal, Zhu, & Korattyswaroopan, 2007), and only
under certain circumstances they may be perceived as suffi-
ciently serious to warrant parental intervention (prevent chil-
dren from playing outdoors).
Three items were added to the measure of perceived signs
of physical and social disorder. These included the presence
of stray dogs; un-kept open spaces, parks, and footpaths; and
burning joss sticks and paper. Stray dogs are the top safety
hazards affecting children's outdoor PA, an environmental
correlate of PA in other age groups in Hong Kong (Cerin et
al., 2013), and an acknowledged environmental "hazard" in
many other Chinese cities (Hou, Jin, & Ruan, 2012). An item
about un-kept public open spaces, parks, and footpaths was
included in the measure because Hong Kong has large
expanses of open spaces (e.g., country parks). However, most
of these spaces are too steep or overgrown to be suitable for
children's play. "Burning joss sticks and paper" was added to
the measure of signs of physical and social disorder because
it is a rather dangerous practice unique to the Chinese
culture.

6 SAGE Open
In general, the translated/adapted versions of extant self-
report measures of the home and neighborhood environ-
ments showed moderate to excellent levels of test­retest
reliability. The results are consistent with those found (when
available) for the English original versions (Joe et al., 2008;
Rosenberg et al., 2009). Two items were found to have poor
test­retest reliability. One of these items belonged to the
measure of perceived signs of physical and social disorder
and pertained to the presence of "Disorderly or misbehaving
groups of young children." Respondents might have been
unsure as to whether misbehaving young children should be
classified as a sign of social disorder. As this type of occur-
rence is unlikely to be a sign of social disorder and represent
a real threat to the community, we propose the item be
excluded from the scale. Another poorly performing item
was "There are crosswalks and signals on busy streets." We
maintain that this item could also be omitted because it mea-
sures an aspect of the environment that is relevant to walking
for transportation, which preschool-aged children are
unlikely to engage in when unaccompanied.
Of note is that measures of places for child's PA and avail-
ability of passive-play equipment at home showed the high-
est levels of test­retest reliability, possibly due to the more
objective nature of these features as compared with those
involving affective judgments (e.g., threat posed by strang-
ers) and a greater level of respondents' knowledge about
these features (equipment at home as opposed to equipment
in the neighborhood). It is also noteworthy that all measures
had an acceptable level of internal consistency indicating
that they gauged unidimensional features of the perceived
environment.
We developed a preliminary measure of perceived risk of
unintentional injury appropriate for Chinese parents of pre-
school-age children. This is an understudied aspect of the
neighborhood environment that is unrelated to crime and traf-
fic hazards but that can be an important source of concern for
parents of young children (Bruce et al., 2004). During forma-
tive work, five main threats of unintentional injury in the
neighborhood were identified. Mirroring the newly added
items to the scale of perceived signs of physical and social
disorder, the presence of stray animals and littered and un-kept
outdoor spaces, streets, and footpaths were identified as pos-
sible sources of injury. Falling objects from high-rise build-
ings were also identified as a significant danger to young
children playing outdoors. This is in line with a previous study
on Hong Kong older adults (Cerin et al., 2010) and highlights
the nature of the built environment of Hong Kong and other
Chinese metropolises typified by a large number of compactly
located, residential high-rise buildings with opens spaces,
small parks, and playgrounds within close proximity. Of note
was the fact that the mere act of playing outdoors was identi-
fied as a potential source of unintentional injury (falling while
playing). The test­retest reliability of this new scale was mod-
erate and its level of internal consistency acceptable.
Establishing whether the metric properties of the mea-
sures examined in this study are generalizable to other
Chinese populations is warranted. Future studies will also
need to establish the construct validity of the examined
measures by conducting confirmatory factor analyses
(where appropriate) and estimating associations of the indi-
vidual measures with preschool-aged children's PA
behavior.
Conclusion
We adapted and translated in Chinese seven extant measures
of various perceived aspects of the home and neighborhood
environments deemed to be relevant to urban Chinese pre-
school-aged children's PA and appropriate for their parents/
primary caregivers. We also developed a new measure of
perceived risk of unintentional injury in the neighborhood
and examined the test­retest reliability and, where applica-
ble, the internal consistency of all eight measures. This study
suggests that all measures have adequate levels of test­retest
reliability and internal consistency and can be potentially
used in studies of environmental correlates of urban Chinese
preschool-aged children's PA. Yet, the measures' factorial
validity and predictive validity as actual correlates of Chinese
preschool-aged children's PA need to be assessed in future
studies.
