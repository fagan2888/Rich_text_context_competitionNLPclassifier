Abstract
Objective: To test transethnic replication of a genetic risk score for obesity in white and black young adults using a national
sample with longitudinal data.
Design and Methods: A prospective longitudinal study using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Sibling
Pairs (n = 1,303). Obesity phenotypes were measured from anthropometric assessments when study members were aged
18­26 and again when they were 24­32. Genetic risk scores were computed based on published genome-wide association
study discoveries for obesity. Analyses tested genetic associations with body-mass index (BMI), waist-height ratio, obesity,
and change in BMI over time.
Results: White and black young adults with higher genetic risk scores had higher BMI and waist-height ratio and were more
likely to be obese compared to lower genetic risk age-peers. Sibling analyses revealed that the genetic risk score was
predictive of BMI net of risk factors shared by siblings. In white young adults only, higher genetic risk predicted increased
risk of becoming obese during the study period. In black young adults, genetic risk scores constructed using loci identified
in European and African American samples had similar predictive power.
Conclusion: Cumulative information across the human genome can be used to characterize individual level risk for obesity.
Measured genetic risk accounts for only a small amount of total variation in BMI among white and black young adults.
Future research is needed to identify modifiable environmental exposures that amplify or mitigate genetic risk for elevated
BMI.

Introduction
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered
genetic loci that associate with obesity risk [1]. Genetic risks
manifest early in life; children at higher genetic risk gain weight
more rapidly during infancy and early childhood and reach
adiposity rebound earlier in life and at higher body-mass-index
(BMI) [2­4]. In turn, this rapid growth early in life functions as a
mediator of genetic risk for adult obesity [4]. These observations
suggest the possibility that genetic information can inform research
to understand pathogenesis of obesity in childhood, with the goal
of improving prevention and treatment [5,6].
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) discovered in GWAS
of obesity phenotypes have small effects; the most penetrant SNP
predicts an increase of less than one half of one BMI point in adult
samples [7]. As a result, many samples designed to investigate
obesity etiology are underpowered to study individual GWAS
discoveries. Combining information on multiple GWAS discov-
ered SNPs to compute a ``genetic risk score'' can provide a tool for
investigating genetic contributions to obesity etiology in samples
far smaller than are needed for GWAS [8,9].
To date, most genetic risk score research on obesity has focused
on European-descent samples [2­4,10,11]. Expanding the scope of
genetic research to consider other populations is a public health
priority [12]. A challenge is that GWAS-discovered SNPs may not
cause disease themselves, but may instead serve as proxy measures
of causal variants elsewhere in the DNA sequence. Allele
frequencies and patterns of linkage disequilibrium vary across
racial and ethnic groups [13]. One implication of these differences
is that a SNP measured in a GWAS may serve as a proxy for a
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 7 | e101596
given causal variant in the GWAS discovery population, but not in
a new sample drawn from a different ethnic group. This problem
is compounded when GWAS discoveries are followed up in
existing databases that may not contain the original GWAS-
discovered SNP and proxies must be selected [14].
An increasing number of large and representative samples of
adults from diverse populations are available with genome wide
data from respondents. Genetic risk scores are a promising tool for
population health research using such datasets but relatively small
differences in allele frequency and LD patterns across groups may
complicate the interpretation of genetic risk associations [15,16]. A
necessary first step is to test scores in different ethnic populations
and establish whether a genetic risk score based on discoveries
made in one population will translate to another.
This study tests transethnic replication of a genetic risk score for
obesity in white and black young adults in the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Sibling
Pairs Study. We tested genetic associations with obesity at two
waves (when respondents were roughly 18­26 and 24­32 years
old, respectively). We next tested genetic associations with change
in obesity over the 7-year interval between waves. We conducted
tests separately in the white and black samples and then tested for
differences in genetic associations between the two groups. We also
compared the performance of the GRSs computed from SNPs
identified in samples of European ancestry to additional GRSs that
incorporate SNPs discovered in a recent GWAS of African
Americans.
Materials and Methods
Sample
Add Health is a nationally representative cohort (n = 20,745,
aged 12­20 years at Wave 1 in 1994­95) drawn from a probability
sample of 80 US high schools and 52 US middle schools,
representative of US schools in 1994­95 with respect to region,
urban setting, school size, school type and race or ethnic
background. The Wave 3 (2001­2002) and 4 (2008­2009) data
collection originally contained n = 15,197 individuals (then aged
18­26 years, mean age 22.3 years) and n = 15,701 individuals (then
aged 24­32 years, mean age 28.9 years) respectively. The Add
Health Sibling Pairs [17] data used here consists of 1,595
individuals (58% white, 42% black) from 965 families (564 sibling
pairs, 30 sibling trios, 2 sibling quads, and 369 singletons) who
were genotyped from samples collected during Wave 4 of the Add
Health study (this phase of the Add Health study genotyped only
the Sibling Pairs). The Sibling Pairs cohort oversampled black
respondents (42.1% of Sibling Pairs as compared to 28.4% of all
Add Health are black). The Sibling Pairs cohort did not differ from
the full Add Health sample in terms of gender, age, maternal
education, or health of the respondents (detailed results available
upon request). The Siblings Pairs cohort was roughly 0.25 BMI
units above the full Add Health sample at both Waves 3 and 4 but
the waist to height ratios were identical in both groups. Missing
data for phenotypic information reduced the number of respon-
dents that could be used in the below analyses. The exact
reduction in sample varied by phenotype, but the minimum white
sample used in analysis was 773 respondents and the minimum
black sample was 530 respondents (n = 1,303).
Genetic Risk Score
Genotyping was conducted with the Illumina HumanOmni1-
Quad v1 platform using DNA extracted (via Oragene saliva
collection) from 1,946 individuals at Wave 4. After quality controls
(see http://ibs.colorado.edu/jb/pairsgwasqc.pdf), the genetic da-
tabase included 1,886 individuals with valid data on 940,862 single
nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis focused on non-Hispanic
white and black individuals as indicated by self-report (n = 1,303)
and SNPs with missing call rates below 5% (this criteria resulted in
the removal of 18,665 SNPs from the original set of 959,862
SNPs). Principal components, which are commonly used to adjust
for population stratification in GWAS [13], were computed with
231, 649 SNPs (selected from the full set of SNPs to be in linkage
equilibria) from chromosomes 1­22.
We constructed three multi-locus indicators of genetic risk for
obesity. The genetic risk score for European-descent populations
(GRS-E) included 31 SNPs discovered in GWAS of adult BMI in
European-descent individuals [7] (this risk score is available
through the restricted use mechanism of Add Health). The genetic
risk score for African-Americans (GRS-A) included 8 SNPs
discovered in GWAS of adult BMI in African American and
African individuals [18]. Genetic risk scores were created from sets
of SNPs identified as genome-wide significant in their respective
studies. We constructed a third genetic risk score (GRS-Omni)
from the complete set of loci discovered in either GWAS. For loci
in or near the genes FTO, SEC16B, and GNPDA2, the two GWAS
identified loci in high linkage disequilibrium (r.0.9) and a single
tag SNP was selected. The method used to compute the risk scores
was the same for each set of SNPs. We summed the BMI-
increasing alleles (as identified in each GWAS) for each SNP and
then summed these counts of BMI-increasing alleles across the
SNPs. Due to the lack of a comparable effect size metric between
the Speliotes et al. [7] and Monda et al. [18], we use unweighted
risk scores in most analyses although we also report weighted risk
scores for GRS-E (using weights from [7]) to examine sensitivity to
the weighting. For individuals with missing information on SNPs
to be included in a risk score (8% of individuals were missing
information on at least one SNP in GRS-Omni but no individual
was missing information on more than four SNPs), we calculated
pro-rated genetic risk scores by dividing the calculated genetic risk
score by the number of SNPs with available calls and multiplying
by the total number of SNPs in the score.
The SNPs included in the genetic risk scores are reported in
Tables 1 and 2. Since base rates of the risk alleles varied between
the white and black samples, we standardized the weighted sums
of risk alleles to have a mean of 0 and a SD of 1 separately in each
of the white and black samples for each genetic risk score. (For
analyses conducted using both white and black samples, results
were consistent if risk scores are instead standardized across race).
In the black sample, GRS-E and GRS-Omni were highly
correlated (r = 0.91); GRS-A was less correlated with both (with
GRS-E, r = 0.23; with GRS-Omni, r = 0.54). Effect-sizes reported
from genetic risk score analyses reflect the effect of a one standard-
deviation increase in genetic risk on obesity outcomes.
Anthropometry
Anthropometric assessments of the Sibling Pairs were conducted
at Add Health waves 3 and 4. Weight and height were measured
during in-person interviews [19]. Participants were weighed
without shoes on a digital bathroom scale (to the nearest half-
pound in Wave 3 and tenth of a kilogram in Wave 4). The scales
had a maximum of 330 pounds (200 kg); individuals above these
thresholds were coded as being at the maximum scale weights (9
and 19 individuals were coded at this maximum weight for Waves
3 and 4 respectively). Heights were measured to the nearest 1/8th
of an inch. BMI was computed as kilograms per height in meters
squared. Obesity was defined as BMI$30. Anthropometric
characteristics of the white and black samples are described in
Table 3.

Statistical Analysis
We tested genetic associations with BMI and obesity using
linear and logistic regression models, respectively. Analyses were
conducted separately in whites and blacks. We analyzed change in
BMI and obesity from Wave 3 to Wave 4 by including the level of
Wave 3 BMI (or obesity) as a predictor in multivariate regression
models predicting Wave 4 BMI (or obesity). All regressions were
estimated using multilevel models (random intercept) to account
for the non-independence of observations within families [20] and
were adjusted for age and sex. All continuous outcomes were
standardized within race. There was greater variability in the BMI
of black respondents, see Table 3. Effect sizes reflect the effect in
SDs of a 1 SD increase in genetic risk score on BMI or BMI
change or on the log odds of obesity or in log odds of change in
obesity (reported as odds ratios).
We conducted two additional sets of analyses. First, because a
previous study reported that the predictive performance of an
obesity genetic risk score differed in black and white populations
[4], we tested for differences in genetic associations with obesity
phenotypes between blacks and whites. These analyses combined
black and white respondents were into a single dataset. The
models included a main effect term for race, a main effect term for
genetic risk, and an interaction term testing race differences in the
magnitude of the genetic effect.
Second, to rule out confounding by unmeasured population
stratification [21], we conducted a sibling difference analysis using
family fixed effects. The sibling difference analysis tested whether,
within a pair of siblings who grew up in the same household, the
sibling with the higher genetic risk score had the higher BMI.
Sibling difference analyses provide a control for any unmeasured
population stratification [22]. To maximize statistical power for
these models, we analyzed all available data from waves 3 and 4
and introduced an individual-level random intercept to account
for the non-independence of observations within individuals.
Results
White and black young adults at higher genetic risk as measured
by GRS-E had higher BMIs compared to their lower genetic risk
age-peers (Table 4). For whites, genetic associations with BMI
were 0.16 at Wave 3 and 0.17 at Wave 4 (p,0.001 for both;
results with unweighted risk scores are reported unless indicated
otherwise). For blacks, genetic associations with BMI were r = 0.14
at Wave 3 and r = 0.13 at Wave 4 (p,0.01 for both). Genetic
associations with BMI did not differ between the white and black
samples at either Wave (p.0.75 for both tests).
White and black young adults at higher genetic risk as measured
by GRS-E were also more likely to be obese compared to those at
lower genetic risk. For whites, genetic associations with obesity
were OR = 1.42 [1.14­1.78] at Wave 3 and OR = 1.54 [1.30­
1.83] at Wave 4. For blacks, genetic associations with obesity were
OR = 1.19 [0.96­1.48] at Wave 3 and OR = 1.19 [0.98­1.45] at
Wave 4. Genetic associations with obesity were similar in blacks
and whites at Wave 3 (p = 0.38). At Wave 4, the effect magnitude
was larger among whites as compared to blacks (p = 0.06). Over
the 7-year interval between waves 3 and 4, white young adults at
higher genetic risk gained more weight and were more likely to
become obese as compared to their lower genetic risk age-peers
(for BMI, r = 0.06, p,0.05; for obesity status, OR = 1.43 [1.14­
1.79]). Genetic risk was not associated with change in BMI and
obesity among blacks. Insufficient statistical power is a possible,
but unlikely, explanation for the failure to detect an association
between the GRS and BMI change in the black Sibling Pairs;
based on the effect observed in the white Sibling Pairs, we have

73% power in the black Sibling Pairs sample. However, the Add
Health Sibling Pairs is slightly underpowered as a dataset to test
black-white differences in genetic risk score associations with BMI
change; power for these analyses was below 50%.
Weighting GRS SNPs by the effect-sizes estimated in GWAS
had a modest effect on genetic risk score performance. Because
weights customize the contribution of each SNP to the GRS
according to its effect on BMI, the expectation is that a weighted
GRS will provide superior prediction as compared to a GRS in
which all SNPs are weighted equally. For most of the phenotypes
analyzed, test-statistics and effect sizes were similar for weighted
and un-weighted scores (Table 4).
We also analyzed genetic associations with a more direct
measure of adiposity: the ratio of waist-circumference to height
[23­25]. Similar to results for BMI, white and black young adults
at higher genetic risk as measured by GRS-E had higher waist-
height ratios as compared to their lower genetic risk peers (for
whites r = 0.16, for blacks r = 0.13; p,0.001 for whites and p,
0.01 for blacks; as with BMI, the waist-height ratio was
standardized in each racial group). Genetic associations did not
differ between white and black samples (p = 0.86).
As a final test of the performance of GRS-E, we examined
sibling differences in BMI using fixed effects regression techniques.
Because previous race-stratified analyses yielded parallel results for
whites and blacks with BMI, we pooled samples for the sibling
differences analysis (for added stringency, we also included the first
four principal components). Results were little changed from our
original analyses. Across the Wave 3 and 4 assessments, the sibling
with the higher genetic risk score had higher BMI (b = 0.62,
p = 0.06; BMI was unstandardized in this analysis).

To test whether incorporating SNPs discovered in GWAS of
African-descent individuals would improve GRS performance in
African Americans, we compared the performance of GRS-E to
that of GRS-A and GRS-Omni in the black Add Health Sibling
Pairs (n = 667). Table 5 reports results for the analyses described
above using the alternate genetic risk scores. For BMI, results were
similar for all genetic risk scores (see also Figure 1). Inclusion of
SNPs discovered in the Monda et al. [18] GWAS of BMI in
African Americans and Africans modestly improved the perfor-
mance of the genetic risk score (GRS-A and GRS-Omni scores
performed better than GRS-E in the black Sibling Pairs).
Discussion
We used data from a prospective longitudinal study to examine
the effects of cumulative genetic risk on body-mass phenotypes in
white and black young adults. Consistent with findings from
previous studies using samples of white adults [4,14,26], individ-
uals at higher genetic risk had higher BMI, were more likely to be
obese, and had higher levels of body fat (as measured by waist-
height ratio) compared to their lower genetic risk peers. A novel
finding of our study is that magnitudes of genetic associations,
especially with BMI, were similar in white and black samples.
Results for white and black samples differed in analyses of change
over time. In the white sample, young adults at higher genetic risk
gained more weight and were more likely to become obese as
compared to those at lower genetic risk. In the black sample, these
associations were in the same direction, but were smaller in
magnitude and not statistically significant. We further showed that
alternate genetic risk scores derived from GWAS of Europeans
and from GWAS of African Americans and Africans performed
similarly in predicting BMI and obesity in African American
young adults. We also note that although the risk score created
from the GWAS on African Americans utilized a small number of
SNPs, the association is unlikely to be driven by a single SNP given
the fact that the weights cited in the GWAS [18] are relatively
consistent with the least predictive SNP being only half as
predictive as the most predictive SNP. In contrast, the most
predictive SNP in the Speliotes et al. [7] GWAS is ten times
predictive as many of the other SNPs.
The magnitudes of genetic associations with obesity phenotypes
were small; e.g. a one SD increase in GRS-E predicted a 0.14 SD
increase in BMI at Wave 3 for those in the black sample. These
translate to roughly a 0.9 point increase in BMI. Using the genetic
risk score as an individual-level risk assessment would produce too
many false positive and false negative results to recommend
immediate clinical translation [27]. Nevertheless, the small effects
we report are consistent with effect sizes for many other
biomarkers routinely assessed in clinical settings [28]. Moreover,
sibling comparison analyses showed that genetic associations with
BMI were detectable within sibling pairs, indicating that genetic
effects, although small, are apparent even in individuals who share
those risk factors for obesity defined by the family environment.
More research is needed to understand how GWAS-discovered
genetic risks combine with other risk factors in order to understand
complex traits [16].
Our findings have important implications for the use of genetic
risk scores in obesity research. Our study provides evidence of
transethnic replication of a genetic risk score for obesity based on
GWAS discoveries in European-descent samples in a population-
based black cohort. Some of the SNPs discovered in GWAS of
obesity in European-descent samples have been replicated in black
samples [18,29], but transethnic replication a GWAS-based
genetic risk score for obesity was uncertain. A recent analysis of
data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study
found that associations between the genetic risk score and obesity
were weaker in blacks as compared to whites [14]. In that study,
the genetic association with body-mass-index was r = 0.13 in
whites, a little less than what we report from Add Health, but
Figure 1. Comparison of GRS predictions. Panel A compares the predictive performance of GRS-E in both white and black samples of Add
Health respondents based on a model where Wave 3 BMI is predicted by only GRS (separately in each racial group). Panel B focuses on predictions
based on the three risk scores for only the black sample of respondents. The fitted lines are based on linear models controlling for age, sex, and one
of the risk scores. The predictions assume an age of 21 and female.

among blacks the magnitude of this association was reduced by
two thirds. Research is needed to determine the cause of the
discrepancy between results from the ARIC and Add Health
cohorts. Three obvious differences in the cohorts are their age­
ARIC participants are in their 50s and 60s whereas Add Health
participants are in their 20s; the timing of assessments­the ARIC
cohort was assessed in the late 1980s and 1990s whereas the Add
Health cohort was assessed in the 2000s; and the geographic
locations where individuals in the samples lived­black ARIC
participants lived in North Carolina and Mississippi whereas Add
Health participants were representatively drawn from across the
United States. Thus, age, period, and cohort factors as well as
factors related to place all represent candidate explanations
[4,26,30].
Developmental processes, gene-environment correlations, and
gene-environment interactions are promising targets for future
inquiry into variation in the effects of obesity genetic risk scores
[31­33]. Research in European-descent samples has identified
rapid childhood growth, partly arising from decreased satiety
response, as a mediator of genetic risk for obesity and points to
sedentary lifestyle and poor diet as important moderators of
genetic risk for obesity [10,11,14,34]. These factors and others
may differ between Add Health black respondents and the older
African Americans examined in other studies, contributing to the
small differences in genetic associations with obesity that we
observe at Wave 4. Now that this study has provided evidence for
transethnic replication of the genetic risk score in black young
adults, future research can investigate the role of gene-environ-
ment interactions in determining genetic associations with obesity
in blacks.
We acknowledge limitations. First, we provide evidence for
transethic replication of genetic risk score associations with obesity
phenotypes in white and black young adults, but results may not
generalize to other ethnic groups. Additional studies focusing on
other populations are needed. Second, the obesity phenotypes we
examined were derived from anthropometric assessments that may
capture body-size variation due to muscle mass as well as
adiposity. We did replicate genetic associations with body-mass
index using waist-circumference-to-height ratio, a superior mea-
sure of adiposity (that was available only for Wave 4). Finally, Add
Health is a nationally representative sample, but the Sibling Pairs
Study subsample that we analyzed is smaller and may not
represent children who do not have siblings. As with all genetic
research, replication of findings in additional samples is a priority.
