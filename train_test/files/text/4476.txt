Abstract
Objective: To explore the incidence and possible underlying pathogenic mechanisms of
nontraumatic convexal subarachnoid haemorrhage (cSAH; a rarely reported condition) in a
cohort of Chinese patients.
Methods: Medical records from all patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) who had been
treated at Peking University Third Hospital, China, between January 2010 and December 2014
were retrospectively reviewed to identify cases of cSAH.
Results: Of 144 patients with SAH, cSAH was observed in 14 cases (9.7%). The most frequent
presenting symptoms in cSAH cases were severe headache (n ¼ 8) and a focal neurological deficit
(n ¼ 8). The parietal (10/14 patients, 71.4%) and frontal (9/14 patients, 64.3%) lobes were the most
common haemorrhage sites. Cause of cSAH was identified in 11 patients: in seven cases (50.0%),
significant stenosis or occlusion in the internal carotid artery system, ipsilateral to cSAH, was
reported; in four cases, cSAH was caused by cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebrovascular
malformation, anticoagulant therapy or possible cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
Conclusion: cSAH is an important subtype of nonaneurysmal SAH, with diverse aetiologies. In
the present study, internal carotid artery system atherosclerotic stenosis was the most frequent
cause of cSAH.

Introduction
Nontraumatic convexal subarachnoid
haemorrhage (cSAH) is an atypical presen-
tation of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH),
in which the haemorrhage is located in one
or a few cortical sulci of the brain.1 cSAH
remains under-reported in the literature, and
to the present authors' knowledge, there are
currently no published systematic or com-
prehensive reviews of the topic.
Causes of cSAH are diverse, and other than
aneurysm rupture, include cerebral amyloid
angiopathy, reversible cerebral vasoconstric-
tion syndrome, coagulopathy, cerebral venous
thrombosis, vascular malformation, vasculitis,
posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syn-
drome, brain tumours and abscesses, bilateral
internal carotid artery stenosis and drug
misuse.2­13
In the present study, medical records
from patients who had been diagnosed
with SAH at Peking University Third
Hospital, Beijing, China, between January
2010 and December 2014 were retrospect-
ively reviewed to ascertain the prevalence of
cSAH, to collate information regarding the
main clinical and radiological presentations,
and to determine possible underlying patho-
genic mechanisms.
Patients and methods
This retrospective, observational cohort
study included patients with cSAH, who
were admitted to Peking University Third
Hospital, Beijing, China between January
2010 and December 2014. The radiology
reports of consecutive patients with SAH,
who were admitted within the study period,
were screened to identify patients with poten-
tial cSAH.1 Eligible patients were! 18 years-
of-age and presented with hyperdensity
exclusively in a cortical sulci identified by
computed tomography (CT SOMATOM
Definition Flash; Siemens Medical Systems;
Erlangen, Germany) and/or a hyperintensity
observed on fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI; MAGNETOM SonataTM system;
Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen,
Germany), and hypointensity observed
using gradient recalled echo T2*-weighted
MRI sequences. Patients with traumatic
haemorrhage and/or parenchymal bleedings
that ruptured into the subarachnoid space
were excluded. Medical records including
hospital notes, laboratory data (comprising
routine blood tests, blood biochemistry,
coagulation function, autoimmunity and
tumour-related tests), and imaging results
(including plain CT, CT angiography, MRI,
magnetic resonance angiography, magnetic
resonance venography, and digital subtrac-
tion angiography) were reviewed. Data relat-
ing to patient demographics, clinical
presentation, and outcome were documented
and collated. Patient follow-up data up to 30
March, 2015 were also reviewed.
The study was approved by the institu-
tional review board of Peking University
Third Hospital (Approval No. 2013144).
Patient informed consent was not con-
sidered to be required due to the retrospect-
ive, observational nature of the study.
Results
Of 144 patients identified with spontaneous
SAH, 14 fulfilled the criteria for nontrau-
matic cSAH. Demographic and clinical
characteristics are shown in Table 1 and
Table 2. The study cohort consisted of 10
male and four female patients (median age,
62 years [range 19­87 years]). With the
exception of one 19-year-old female, all
patients were > 45 years. Medical history
data revealed that the most common con-
comitant condition was hypertension (10
patients). Two patients had experienced a
previous transient ischemic attack, one had
experienced a cerebral infarction, one had
experienced a previous SAH, and the remain-
ing 10 patients had no previous history of
cerebral vascular disease (Table 2).

Clinical presentation
Headache was one of the most common
presenting symptoms (8 patients) and
among these patients, two had neck rigidity
and none had a history of migraine. One of
the patients with headache (patient 10) also
had generalized seizures and although there
was no history of epilepsy and trauma, the
patient responded well to anticonvulsants,
and an MRI scan and magnetic resonance
venography showed the presence of a sig-
moid sinus thrombosis. Three other patients
with headache presented with unilateral
weakness and numbness.
Eight patients presented with focal
neurological deficits as the main symptom.
Two of these patients experienced transient
weakness of both lower limbs and six
patients had unilateral symptoms that per-
sisted over 24 h. Six of the patients with
neurological deficits had MRI scan images
available, and acute ischemic stroke was
confirmed in four patients. One 74-year-old
female (patient 3) had reported experiencing
dizziness, and the CT scan showed a left
parietal lobe cSAH.
Imaging findings
Plain CT scans were available for all 14
patients with cSAH and showed that haem-
orrhages were typically unilateral (observed
in 12 [85.7%] patients) and localized
between one to three neighbouring sulci
(Table 1). Two patients had bihemispheric
involvement: a 56-year-old male (patient 11)
who was receiving warfarin for mesenteric
vein thrombosis caused by phlebitis; and an
87-year-old male (patient 13), who after 6
months experienced a second cSAH attack
involving the right frontal and parietal lobe
sulci. The most common haemorrhage sites
were the parietal and frontal lobes, observed
in 10 patients (71.4%) and 9 patients
(64.3%), respectively.
Cranial MRIs were available for 11
patients, of whom 10 had undergone diffu-
sion-weighted MRI. Four patients were
found to have scattered acute subcortical
infarcts all of which were ipsilateral with the
cSAH. Representative scan images from a
53-year-old male (patient 6) with right sided
cSAH, acute ischemic stroke and severe
(75%) stenosis of the right middle cerebral
artery (MCA) are shown in Figure 1. Of nine

60-year-old male (patient 7) showed small
microbleeds in the basal ganglia.
Vascular imaging was performed on 10
patients and included magnetic resonance
angiography, magnetic resonance venography,
CT angiography and digital subtraction
angiography. Following review of the
images (JH), no evidence of reversible cere-
bral vasoconstriction syndrome was found.
Seven patients showed significant arterial
stenosis (!70%) or occlusion affecting the
anterior cerebral artery (ACA), MCA,

posterior cerebral artery (PCA), or internal
carotid artery. For two of these patients,
scattered acute ischemic stroke was con-
firmed by MRI and the stroke infarcts and
cSAH were in the same region of the narrow
arteries. Three patients had patent menin-
geal arteries confirmed by digital subtrac-
tion angiography. One patient (patient 1), a
58-year-old male, had A1 segment narrow-
ing in the left ACA to > 90% without open-
ing of the anterior communicating artery;
the second patient (patient 2) was a 60-year-
old female with scans showing occlusion of
the right MCA and compensatory flow from
the ipsilateral ACA via the meningeal artery
(Figure 2). This patient had total occlusion
from the M1 segment of the right MCA.
The left ACA obtained blood supply from
the right internal carotid artery via the
anterior communicating artery. The right
MCA received compensatory feeding from
the ipsilateral ACA via the meningeal artery,
and from the ipsilateral PCA via the
meningeal artery. The third patient (patient
3) was a 74-year-old female who had signifi-
cant stenosis (70%) of the left internal
carotid artery at C1 and C6 segments. The
left posterior communicating artery and
anterior communicating artery were patent
and the left MCA region was supplied by the
left PCA via the meningeal artery and the
left ophthalmic artery through the recurrent
meningeal branch artery.
Laboratory findings
For all patients, platelet counts during the
hospital stay were within a normal range
(120­350 Â 109/l). Ten patients received
coagulation function screening and in one
patient (patient 7), the serum D-dimer level
was elevated to 0.65 mg/ml (normal range,
0­0.3ug/ml) but autoimmunity (including
thyroid function, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibo-
dies, extractable nuclear antigens, double-

dies) and tumour-related test results
(including [see ] cancer antigen [CA]125,
CA199, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-
fetoprotein and squamous cell carcinoma)
for this patient were normal.
Patient follow-up
Follow-up data was available for all
patients, and showed that in the one patient
(patient 11) who was taking anticoagulant
medications (warfarin) prior to the cSAH,
these were subsequently terminated. The
cause of cSAH in patient 10 was cerebral
venous sinus thrombosis, and consequently
this patient began taking anticoagulants
following the cSAH. Patient 14 had a
repeat cerebral infarction one week after
the first event and received aspirin as anti-
platelet treatment. Patient 8 had a repeat
cSAH in the same occlusion artery region
approximately two years following the first
cSAH. Patient 13, who had a cSAH in the
bilateral frontal parietal lobe, had a repeat
cSAH in the right parietal lobe approxi-
mately six months later.
The cause of cSAH was identified in 11
patients and remained undetermined in
three (patients 5, 12, 14). Significant internal
carotid artery system atherosclerosis was the
most common cause of cSAH (n ¼ 7,
50.0%). For the remaining four patients,
cSAH was caused by cerebral venous sinus
thrombosis (patient 10), cerebrovascular
malformation (patient 9), anticoagulant
therapy (patient 11) or possible cerebral
amyloid angiopathy (patient 13).
Discussion
Of 144 patients with SAH who attended
Peking University Third Hospital between
January 2010 and December 2014, cSAH
was observed in 14 cases (9.7%). This
prevalence is higher than previously
reported (6.0­7.5%),1,4,6 possibly due to a
number of factors including the retrospect-
ive nature of the present study, which may
have led to selection bias. In addition, a
radiologic database was used to identify
patients with cSAH in the present study,
rather than a diagnostic code, because the
authors believe that cSAH could easily be
missed, as coding may be inaccurate and
lead to an underestimation of the condition.
Overall, however, the present data agree
with other reports that show nontraumatic
cSAH is a relatively rare condition in
patients with SAH.2­13
Internal carotid artery system atheroma-
tous disease was the most common cause of
cSAH in the present study, affecting 50%
patients, and was higher than the previously
reported prevalence of 33%.1 All of the
present cohort were acutely symptomatic
suggesting that cSAH may derive from an
acute alteration in haemodynamics (e.g.,
plaque rupture and/or further atherothrom-
botic narrowing or acute hypertension). In
addition, all the present cases of cSAH were
associated with significant ipsilateral intra-
cranial disease. Although a few cases of
cSAH associated with symptomatic intra-
cranial stenosis or occlusion have been
reported,1,9,10 the pathologic mechanisms
remain unclear. Despite carefully reviewing
all imaging studies, no evidence of reversible
cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome was
found in the present patient cohort.
In an observational study of 24 patients
with cSAH, five cases with concurrent ische-
mic lesions were reported.14 In another study
involving 15 patients with cSAH, five cases of
concomitant carotid artery stenosis were
described.1 In a retrospective review of 4 953
patients with acute stroke/transient ischemic
attack involving eight (0.16%) patients with
cSAH, five patients had occlusion of major
arteries and three were suggested as having
cerebral amyloid angiopathy.5 Several studies
have suggested that cerebral amyloid angio-
pathy is a common cause of cSAH.1,3,5,6 In
the present study, nine patients had gradient
1876 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
recalled echo T2*-weighted MRIs and none
fulfilled the criteria for possible or probable
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (including mul-
tiple haemorrhages of varying sizes/ages with
no other explanation, or a single lobar,
cortical, or cortical/subcortical haemorrhage
without another cause, multiple haemor-
rhages with a possible but not a definite
cause, or some haemorrhage in an atypical
location).15 One patient in the present study,
however, an 87-year-old male with recurrent
cSAH, may have had cerebral amyloid
angiopathy, but this could not be confirmed
due to lack of MRI scan or vessel imaging.
Antithrombotic drug use has also been sug-
gested to be associated with an increased risk
of SAH,16 however, only one patient was
found in the present study, for whom antith-
rombotic drug use may have accounted for
the cSAH.
The results of the present study may be
limited by several factors. First, the observa-
tions were from a single tertiary care centre
using a small sample of patients, and thus,
may have been influenced by selection bias.
Secondly, this was a retrospective study and
not all patients had undergone cerebral
angiography and MRI, which meant data
may have been incomplete. Moreover, some
small vascular malformations, small aneur-
ysms, focal venous thromboses, malignant
tumours or vasculitis may have been missed.
Finally, although no patients died during the
hospitalisation period in the present study,
the lack of systematic follow-up for these
patients made it difficult to infer accurate
prognostic data for the present cohort. The
outcome of cSAH appears to depend on the
underlying aetiology of the disease and age.6
Thus, a well-designed, prospective, case-con-
trolled, double-blind, multicentre study is
required to overcome the shortcomings of
the present small study.
In conclusion, internal carotid artery
system atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion
was the most common cause of cSAH in the
present study of 14 patients with cSAH.
The authors suggest that vascular radio-
graphic evaluation, particularly cervical
vessel imaging, should be performed in all
patients with cSAH so that a potentially
fatal underlying vascular abnormality may
not be missed. Further prospective studies
are needed to substantiate the present results
and to investigate whether patients with
cSAH and significant atheromatous disease
should be treated with antiplatelet therapy.
