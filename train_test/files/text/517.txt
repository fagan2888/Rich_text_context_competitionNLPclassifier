ABSTRACT: The aims of this study were to quantify and describe the variations in respiratory
symptoms and diagnosis prevalence across regions of the world according to national income.
In 2002 and 2003, the World Health Organization implemented the World Health Survey (WHS),
which used a standardised survey instrument to compile comprehensive baseline information on
health and healthcare expenditure. We analysed the WHS data to assess the global patterns of
self-reported wheeze and doctor-diagnosed asthma, two commonly reported measures of
respiratory health.
In total there were 308,218 participants with complete records, from 64 countries. The weighted
mean age of the survey population was 43 yrs. Global prevalence of current wheezing symptoms
ranged from 2.4% in Vietnam to 24% in Brazil; the prevalence of diagnosed asthma ranged from
1.8% in Vietnam to 32.8% in Australia. Overall, the prevalence of symptoms and diagnosis showed
a U-shaped pattern with the largest prevalence reported in low- and high-income countries. The
smallest prevalence was consistently found in middle-income countries.
These WHS analyses have provided global prevalence estimates of wheeze and doctor-
diagnosed asthma using data gathered simultaneously and consistently across six continents.
These findings support the need for continued global respiratory illness surveillance for disease
prevention, health policy and management.
KEYWORDS: Asthma, income inequality, prevalence, wheezing, World Health Survey
Over the past several decades, worldwide
increases in the prevalence of asthma
have been reported in surveillance and
epidemiological studies [1, 2]. Asthma is char-
acterised by variable airflow limitation or airway
hyperresponsiveness to various environmental
stimuli [3­5]. Wheezing is the most common
symptom associated with asthma, although
wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and short-
ness of breath are all symptoms often used to
define asthma [6­11].
The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) reports
adult asthma prevalence ranging from 5­18% with
increases in associated morbidity and decreasing
associated mortality in industrialised countries [1,
12, 13]. GINA was established in 1989 by the United
States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes,
National Institutes of Health and the World Health
Organization (WHO), to raise awareness among
health professionals, governments and the general
public about the dangers and increasing prevalence
of asthma [13­16]. In 2003 and 2004, GINA
published reports on the global burden of asthma,
based on literature reviews primarily from peer-
reviewed publications based on the International
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood
(ISAAC) and European Community Respiratory
Health Survey (ECRHS). GINA continues to
update the reports as new information becomes
available [13, 17].
In 2002 and 2003, WHO implemented the World
Health Survey (WHS), which used a standardised
survey instrument to compile comprehensive
baseline information on a wide range of health
measures (including asthma) and healthcare
expenditures. The broader aims of the WHS were
to develop low-cost, valid, reliable and compar-
able cross-national information and an evidence

base for surveillance and policy adjustment [18]. All 192 WHO
member states were invited to take part in this effort and just
over one-third participated.
While the WHS collected data across six continents from adults
aged o18 yrs, ECRHS only gathered information from Europe
and Australia, and ISAAC is restricted data collection to
children aged ,15 yrs.
In the research described herein, WHS data were utilised to
assess the global patterns of respiratory disease. The objectives
of our study were to quantify the prevalence of respiratory
symptoms and diagnosis worldwide using data collected with
identical survey questions and systematic population survey
methods; and to describe the variations in respiratory
symptom and diagnosis prevalence across world regions
according to national income.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects and data collection methods
The WHS was administered in 70 countries, of which 68
responded to respiratory symptom questions and 64 reported
on asthma diagnosis. Each country's national health ministry
was responsible for the survey programme. The countries that
chose to participate in the survey, their economic standing
(income status), sample size and type of survey used (short or
full) can be found on the WHO website for the WHS [18]. The
full questionnaire included questions on several factors
associated with living conditions in most economically develop-
ing nations (such as mud housing) and collected information on
social habits in countries where such surveillance systems do
not exist (such as smoking prevalence). The short version
omitted several of these questions and was administered to
mostly higher income countries. WHO provided each country
with the relevant training to carry out the survey and conduct
data analyses [18].
The WHS had a list of options and modules for the various
survey components. The modules measured aspects of health
in multiple domains: 1) risk factors, e.g. tobacco, alcohol and
pollution; 2) responsiveness of health systems and whether
health systems met expectations; 3) coverage, access and
utilisation of key health services, e.g. immunisation, treatment
of childhood illness, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/
AIDS; and 4) healthcare expenditures. Each country chose
which combination of modules to use.
A number of pre-tested survey administration tools were
available and each country could choose the method that it
judged most practical and cost-effective. The choices were the
following: household face-to-face survey; computer-assisted
telephone interview survey, which was conducted using
computerised systems when there was good telephone net-
work coverage; and computer-assisted personal interview
survey using a portable personal computer to replace paper
and pen methods of data collection.
The eligible population for the WHS consisted of adults aged
o18 yrs. The sample from each country was stratified by sex,
age and type of residence (rural/urban). Individuals were
sampled from these strata and each respondent was given a
separate sampling probability value (or weight). Only one
person from a randomly selected household was interviewed
for the individual questionnaire and was ultimately included
in these analyses.
National income
Countries were grouped by their per capita gross national
income in purchasing power parity (GNI PPP) [18, 19], which
were taken from the World Bank's data and statistics tables [19,
20]. Countries were classified into tertiles based on GNI PPP:
per capita income of fUS$ 3,000 (low income); US$ 3,000 to
US$ 8,000 (middle income); and .US$ 8,000 (high income). All
analyses were conducted on ungrouped countries as well as
with the tertiles.
Sampling weights
The WHS employed a probability sampling design. This meant
that every individual in the sampling frame (o18 yrs) had a
known and non-zero chance of being selected into the survey
sample. Some countries used a single-stage random-sample
strategy; however, most sites carried out multi-stage cluster
sampling methods and probability weights were used for each
stage. In either case, the WHS sampling frame aimed to cover
100% of the eligible population in the surveyed country.
Therefore, the weighted estimates are corrected for the indivi-
dual probabilities of being surveyed. Further details about the
WHO sampling guidelines are available from WHO [18].
For a multi-stage cluster sample, the total probability of being
sampled was calculated by multiplying all the probabilities
within a sample stage. The inverse of this total probability was
the probabilistic individual weight for a specific person within
the country. A total weight was calculated for each country by
adding all the individual weights and comparing the sum with
the country population; for countries that used a single-stage
random sample or when the sum of all the weights did not add
up to the adult country population (o18 yrs), a correction
factor was used. Therefore, the weighted data represented
pooled data corrected by the individual probability of being
surveyed (based on age, sex and urban/rural location) and
country population.
Sex and age
Sex was recorded as female or male on the basis of the
interviewer's observation. The WHS questionnaire had two
questions for age. The primary question for age was a
continuous variable. In cases where respondents declined to
answer the question, interviewers were advised to estimate
their age in categories. For the purpose of these analyses, the
age ranges were re-grouped into three categories: 18­29 yrs
(reference group), 30­49 yrs, and .50 yrs. A subgroup
analysis was conducted in 18­44-yr-olds to compare with
analyses of the entire the WHS population, as respiratory
symptoms (for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for
example) are far more common at older ages.
Smoking
The short version of the questionnaire omitted the questions
relating to tobacco smoking. The question on the long version
was, ``do you currently smoke any tobacco products such as
cigarettes, cigars or pipes?'' with the following response
choices: daily; yes, but not daily; and no, not at all. A
respondent was considered a current smoker if he/she
answered positively (daily or yes but not daily).

Urban/rural
The household survey for the WHS included information on
location with the following categories used for classification: 1)
urban; 2) peri-urban/semi-urban; 3) rural; and 4) other. These,
along with external databases describing population distribu-
tions [21] for countries that had missing values in the WHS
(Australia, Nepal, Norway, the Netherlands, and Slovenia),
were used to distinguish urban and rural areas during
analyses. Countries that had o50% rural households were
classified as mostly rural; those with ,50% rural were
classified as mostly urban.
Income inequality
An external database was used to import information on country
level income inequality (Gini coefficient) to merge with the WHS
data [21]. The Gini coefficient is a measure of household income
inequality within a country [21, 22]. Gini values for the Comoros
were not available and analyses were conducted by placing the
country as high inequality, then low inequality, then by leaving
the country out entirely, to note any differences in disease
prevalence for the categories. No difference was evident, so Gini
for Comoros was left as missing. Countries with 45 or greater for
a Gini coefficient were considered to have high income inequal-
ity, countries below 45 were considered to have low income
inequality. Further summaries for the country classifications are
available in the supplementary material.
Respiratory outcomes
Five questions on respiratory symptom and diagnosis were
used to describe current wheezing symptoms and diagnosed
asthma.
Current wheezing symptoms
These were indicated if there was a positive response to any of
the following symptom questions. During the last 12 months,
have you experienced any of the following: 1) attacks of
wheezing or whistling breathing? (yes/no); or 2) attacks of
wheezing that came on after you stopped exercising or some
other physical activity? (yes/no). These questions differ
slightly from those used in ECHRS (``have you had wheezing
or whistling in your chest at any time in the last 12 months?'')
[11, 23] and ISAAC (``have you had wheezing or whistling in
the chest in the past 12 months?'' and ``how many attacks of
wheezing have you had in the past 12 months?'') [24­26].
Diagnosed asthma
This was indicated if there was a positive response to any of the
diagnosis questions: 1) ``have you ever been diagnosed with
asthma (an allergic respiratory disease)?'' (yes/no/don't know);
2) ``have you ever been treated for it?'' (yes/no/don't know); 3)
``have you been taking any medications or other treatment for it
during the last 2 weeks?'' (yes/no/don't know). Responses of
``don't know'' were coded as ``no'' for the respiratory outcomes.
These questions differ slightly from those used in ECHRS
(``have you ever had asthma?'' and ``was this confirmed by a
doctor?'') [11, 23] and ISAAC (no direct questions on asthma
diagnosis in the core questionnaire) [24­26].
Statistical analysis
The authors received the final country datasets from WHO in
August 2005. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) [27, 28]. SAS
survey procedures (proc surveyfreq and surveymeans) were
used to account for sampling weights and the complex sampling
design effect. Further details of the data analysis methods are
described elsewhere [29, 30]. Proc glimmix (SAS Institute, Inc.)
was used to obtain weighted multilevel prevalence ratios as a
measure of risk in these cross-sectional data.
Except for a few nonparametric analyses (to obtain Spearman's
rank correlation coefficients), all analyses used the individual
weights described above and accounted for the complex
sampling design effect. Results were stratified by sex, smoking
status (where available) and national income.
Missing data
Respondents who did not provide data on respiratory out-
comes were excluded from the analyses. Current wheezing
symptoms were not asked in Hungary and Nepal, and
diagnosed asthma data was not obtained from Guatemala,
Ethiopia, Nepal, Hungary, Israel or Mexico. Consequently,
these countries do not appear in any tables or figures for those
outcomes.
Miscoded responses or out-of-range codes were changed to
missing and excluded from the analysis. The question on
tobacco smoking was not included in the short questionnaire,
thus the following countries are missing from the analyses
with smoking: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, UK, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal.
The study materials and methods were approved by the
institutional review board at the University of Massachusetts
(Lowell, MA, USA).
RESULTS
The total sample in the WHS was 308,218 (table 1). The
weighted mean age of the survey population was 43 yrs.
Finland had the highest weighted mean age overall (53 yrs)
and Slovakia had the lowest at 34 yrs. Among the portion of
respondents that answered the tobacco use questions, current
smokers were less frequent than nonsmokers. Rural house-
holds accounted for 70% overall and there were slightly more
countries with high income inequality (55%). The middle GNI
PPP category accounted for 44% of the global study popula-
tion, while 35% were in the low-income group and 21% in the
high-income countries.
Respiratory outcomes and population characteristics
Current wheezing symptoms were more prevalent than
diagnosed asthma (table 1). Smokers and those aged .50 yrs
showed the highest prevalence of both categories of asthma.
Males more frequently reported current wheezing symptoms
than females. Overall prevalence patterns of current wheezing
symptoms and diagnosed asthma showed some expected
patterns: an increase with age and more common in smokers
than nonsmokers.
Respiratory outcomes among countries
There was a 10-fold variation in current wheezing symptom
prevalence across countries (2.4% in Vietnam and 24.3% in
Brazil). With a few exceptions, most of the countries
geographically in the global north had a higher prevalence of

current wheezing symptoms than most of the countries in the
global south (fig. 1).
Diagnosed asthma showed a narrower range in prevalence
across countries; the majority of estimates fell within a four-
fold range of prevalence, with Vietnam the lowest at 1.8% and
Australia the highest at 32.8% (fig. 2).
Respiratory outcomes and national income
Regression analyses that included national income without
grouping the countries into tertiles showed almost no associa-
tion with respiratory symptoms or diagnosis (adjusted PR
1.00001, 95% CI 1.00001­1.00002 and PR 1.00003, 95% CI
1.00002­1.00003 for wheezing symptoms and asthma diagno-
sis, respectively). However, for countries grouped by national
income, the high-national income group had the highest
overall weighted prevalence for all respiratory outcomes, with
current wheezing symptoms at 11.7% (fig. 1) and diagnosed
asthma at 9.3% (fig. 2). Prevalence was lowest in the middle-
national income group, with current wheezing symptoms at
6.7% and diagnosed asthma at 4.5%. Nevertheless, the middle
income countries had the largest inter-country range in
prevalence of current wheezing symptoms (3.3% in China
and 24.3% in Brazil). For diagnosed asthma, the widest range
in prevalence was found in the high national income group
(4.2% in Russia and 32.8% in Australia). Overall, the
prevalence of current wheezing symptoms and diagnosed

asthma showed a U-shaped pattern with higher prevalence of
respiratory outcome reported in low- and high-income
countries. Exceptions to this pattern were found for mostly
urban regions and low-Gini countries, where the pattern
showed a peak in current wheezing symptoms for middle-
income countries and an increasing upward trend in diag-
nosed asthma prevalence (moving from low- to high-income
countries) for urban regions only. This U-shaped prevalence
pattern remained in individual categories of smoking and sex,
as well as in mostly rural regions and among high-Gini
countries, even after adjusting for age (table 2). The U-shaped
pattern remained even in subgroup analyses of 18­44-yr-olds.
It should also be noted that the highest prevalence of current
wheezing symptoms was found in low-income countries with
high income inequality (table 2).
The country-level correlation between diagnosed asthma and
current wheezing symptoms was lowest in the middle
national-income group (Spearman's correlation coefficient:
r50.37, p,0.0001) and somewhat higher in both the low
national income group (r50.46, p,0.0001) and the high
national income group of countries (r50.45, p,0.0001).
DISCUSSION
Among the 68 countries with responses to wheezing symp-
toms and the 64 countries surveying diagnosed asthma
outcomes in the WHS, the prevalence varied greatly, ranging
from 2.4% to 24.3% for current wheezing symptoms and 1.8%­
32.8% for diagnosed asthma. In general, highly industrialised
(higher income) countries, such as Australia and countries in
Western Europe, had the higher prevalence of current
wheezing symptoms and diagnosed asthma, while lower
prevalence was found in middle-income countries, particularly
in eastern and central Europe. Brazil, as a middle-income
country, was notable for its very high prevalence of both
diagnosed asthma and current wheezing symptoms. Although
Brazil was in the middle-income countries, it had a high Gini
coefficient [21] and, thus, high within country income inequal-
ity and also had almost 85% (see online supplementary
material) of the survey population responding from urban
households (high urbanisation) indicating that both the income
inequality and high urbanisation might be factors in the high
prevalence of respiratory disease reporting from Brazil [15].
At the community or national level, respiratory disease/
asthma reporting could greatly affect the estimated prevalence,
especially if mortality rates from these conditions are high. In
most of the countries identified in the middle-national income
group, GINA reports have identified very high-mortality rates
due to asthma relative to the low prevalence reported for this
group [13, 16, 17]. However, even with low country reporting
rates, other influential factors may be at play, such as:
environmental (urban air) pollution, which has been identified
as a risk factor for respiratory illness in both children [31­34]
and adults [17, 35]; access to healthcare and disease informa-
tion (which allow for disease identification, treatment, and
management) [17, 36­38]; and the highly contested hygiene
hypothesis [39­44], which postulates that a lack of exposure to
dirt in childhood may increase an individual's susceptibly to
respiratory illnesses, asthma in particular, and may explain
the high asthma prevalence observed for the high-income

countries [1, 2, 13, 17, 34, 40], although high urbanisation is
more likely to be the driving factor. Among low-income
countries, the influencing factors may be exacerbated by
poorer access to healthcare.
The middle national income group was also distinguished by a
high within-group range in prevalence of current wheezing
symptoms, while for diagnosed asthma, the within group range
was highest among the high-national income group. This
difference in within group range between diagnosed asthma
and current wheezing symptoms may reflect the variation in
reporting, as well as the disparity in access to healthcare and
disease information between countries, particularly within the
national income groups. For affirmative responses to diagnosed
asthma, the participant had to have seen a physician and/or
been taking asthma medications. Therefore, one would expect,
as seen here, that asthma diagnosis questions would be more
sensitive to country level of development (and hence access to
medical care) than the current wheezing symptoms questions.
One might also expect that the correlation between current
wheezing symptoms and asthma diagnosis would vary by
socioeconomic and cultural differences, for which national
income may be a partial proxy. Country-level features, such as
access to healthcare, health literacy, willingness to report
symptoms and cultural differences in how breathing problems
are labelled and understood, could all affect the ratio of current
symptoms to diagnosis of asthma. Consistent with this idea,
the country-level correlation between diagnosed asthma and
current wheezing symptoms was lowest in the middle-national
income group (Spearman's correlation coefficient: r50.37,
p,0.0001) and somewhat higher in both the low-national
income group (r50.46, p,0.0001) and the high-national
income group of countries (r50.45, p,0.0001).
The U-shape for the pattern of symptom prevalence across
tertiles of GNI PPP seems to counteract the hypotheses that
relate increases in respiratory symptom prevalence to increased
industrialisation and, thus, increased national income [45­49].
However, country level factors other than national level income,
such as pollution levels (as in urban settings), may be far more
influential in the association with respiratory symptom pre-
valence [13, 15]. Clearly, the prevalence of both symptoms and
diagnosis was quite high across urban regions regardless of
national income. It is likely that this U-shape pattern repre-
sented a net effect of several different factors, with some
contributing to higher risk in low-income countries (occupa-
tional hazards, pollution and poor access to healthcare) and
others tending to increase asthma risk and reporting in high-
income countries (pollution and greater awareness of asthma).
Factors such as these may ``balance out'' in such a way that the
middle-income countries have the lowest risks.
A further challenge in data collection is that even in clinical
settings, asthma is not very well-defined [9, 13­16]. Physician
diagnosis varies greatly by country and many asthmatics are
not diagnosed [13­16, 24]. These complexities in defining
asthma also lead to difficulties in linking factors that may be
associated with asthma aetiology or exacerbation [1, 13­17].
Nevertheless, most surveys have found questions on wheezing
to be a reliable indicator for asthma [9, 11, 13­17, 23, 24, 50, 51].
With these data, our analyses of the WHS presents an effort to
present information beyond that collected in other large
respiratory disease studies, such as ECRHS and ISAAC.
Conclusions
These WHS analyses have provided global estimates of wheez-
ing and doctor-diagnosed asthma prevalence using data that
were gathered concurrently, in a consistent and reliable fashion,
across a wide sample of countries. The patterns in these results
suggest different causes for self-reported wheezing and asthma
diagnoses in different socioeconomic contexts; there is a clear U-
shaped pattern of disease prevalence across strata of national
income. These analyses of validated questions in WHS identify
relationships between country characteristics and respiratory
disease prevalence that are consistent with global trends in
socioepidemiological approaches to structural determinants of
health [13­17, 30].

Our analyses additionally strengthen the body of evidence
supporting the use of questionnaires for studying respiratory
symptoms. We encourage simpler, standardised sampling
strategies to facilitate ongoing data collection in more countries
worldwide. We further believe that these types of studies will
be valuable in global respiratory illness surveillance for disease
prevention, health policy and management.
