Introduction
Analysis of biological evidence in the form of plant and ani-
mal remains is fundamental to environmental reconstruction.
Biological evidence includes, but is not exclusive to pollen,
spores, diatoms, plant macrofossils, mollusca, fossil insect
remains, foraminifera and chironomidae. Pollen analysis is a
versatile, established, and widely used technique (Lowe &
Walker, 1997; Twiddle, 2012), with multiple applications
ranging from environmental reconstructions to forensic evi-
dence. Due to this diversity, we have chosen pollen analysis
to exhibit the advantages of using EcoCount. Identifying,
counting, and recording pollen grains and spores remain a
highly skilled, time-consuming, and demanding task
(Stillman & Flenley, 1996). Standard techniques necessitate
the classification and recording of between 300 and 500 pol-
len grains from each representative sample. The quality and
quantity of the preserved pollen vary, and attaining the mini-
mum number of pollen grains can involve counting numer-
ous slides. Green (1997) suggested the "sheer time and effort
involved in counting pollen" as a significant obstacle to the
progression and development of high-resolution pollen stud-
ies (France, Duller, & Lamb, 2000). Furthermore, Green
(1997) correctly encouraged resolving methodological
impediments in pollen analysis (palynology) as a high prior-
ity and was an advocate of automation. Although automated
pollen counting systems have been proposed and are
continuing to be developed (e.g., Allen et al., 2006; Costa &
Yang, 2009; France et al., 2000; Holt et al., 2011; Langford,
Taylor, & Flenley, 1990; Li & Flenley, 1997), the potential of
these systems appears not to have been fully realized or
embraced by the palynology and wider environmental com-
munity. The reasons for this have ranged from expense of the
systems, reliability and accuracy issues, and simple reluc-
tance of the palynology community to embrace a radical
change to their technique/field. However, efforts have been
made to develop user-friendly low cost systems to facilitate
wider availability (e.g., Costa & Yang, 2009). Until a fully
reliable and financially accessible system is available, simple
changes within the pollen analysis methodology can improve
the efficiency of the palynologist.
There are many steps in the process of pollen analysis that
do make the technique a labor-intensive and a time-consum-
ing activity. Procedural steps such as chemical treatments
during the sample preparation process are essential and can-
not be removed or rushed, for example, spinning to remove
water prior to acetylation. However, with

EcoCount: A New Digital Approach to
Environmental Data Recording
Phillip P. Allen1 and Neil Sewell2
Abstract
Techniques that analyze biological remains from sediment sequences for environmental reconstructions are well established
and widely used. Yet, identifying, counting, and recording biological evidence such as pollen grains remain a highly skilled,
demanding, and time-consuming task. Standard procedure requires the classification and recording of between 300 and 500
pollen grains from each representative sample. Recording the data from a pollen count requires significant effort and focused
resources from the palynologist. However, when an adaptation to the recording procedure is utilized, efficiency and time
economy improve. We describe EcoCount, which represents a development in environmental data recording procedure.
EcoCount is a voice activated fully customizable digital count sheet that allows the investigator to continuously interact with
a field of view during the data recording. Continuous viewing allows the palynologist the opportunity to remain engaged
with the essential task, identification, for longer, making pollen counting more efficient and economical. EcoCount is a
versatile software package that can be used to record a variety of environmental evidence and can be installed onto different
computer platforms, making the adoption by users and laboratories simple and inexpensive. The user-friendly format of
EcoCount allows any novice to be competent and functional in a very short time.

procedural experience, the preparation of samples can be
relatively efficient. Yet once the laboratory preparation phase
has been successfully completed, there is ample opportunity
for improvement of the current procedure. One specific area
for enhancement is the actual data recording of the identified
pollen and spores. Once the palynologist has identified the
pollen grain or spore, the data along with ancillary informa-
tion such as preservation condition, presence of charcoal, or
the preparation spike (e.g., lycopodium) are entered onto a
count sheet. The use of a paper count sheet remains a com-
mon occurrence for the palynologist and is often augmented
by a number of hand tally counters (analogue and digital)
that have been designated a specific pollen type.
Computerized count sheets utilizing software such as
Microsoft Excel have been used and remove the data entry
step into subsequent programs such as Tilia/TGView
(Grimm, 1992, 2004), but the current process of recording
the primary pollen data represents an inefficient step in the
palynologist's routine.
Currently, recording pollen types requires the palynolo-
gists to look away from the microscope, find the correct taxa
on the sheet/tally counter/cell, and physically enter data,
which over the duration of a full count represents a signifi-
cant inefficient use of time.
We acknowledge that the process of physically recording
the pollen allows the palynologist to further engage and
become familiar with the evolving data set, which develops a
deeper connectivity to the results. Yet, constantly breaking
contact with the field of view remains a cumulative ineffi-
cient use of time. Therefore, if a record of the identified pol-
len could be constructed while the palynologist continues to
engage with the field of view and connects to the developing
data set, it would make one aspect of the pollen counting
procedure more efficient and economical. The process of
manually transferring data from the count sheet into a spread-
sheet or directly into programs such as Tilia/TGView
(Grimm, 1992, 2004) is time-consuming. If this step of phys-
ical data recording and transfer could be eliminated from the
procedure, it would save further time and remove an ineffi-
cient step in the working-up of pollen data.
EcoCount--The Advantage of the New
Digital Approach to Environmental
Data Recording
An alternative technique that improves efficiency for data
recording and transfer is presented here. The EcoCount pro-
gram is a voice activated automated computer program.
EcoCount uses the Microsoft Speech Application
Programmers Interface (API) to perform both listening and
speech synthesis. The API enables the software to record the
user's voice and parse the recorded sound to identify key-
words and phrases. EcoCount uses these words and phrases
and interprets the user's requirement, for instance, by
incrementing the count of a particular type of pollen. The
configuration (Figure 1) can be via a headset or freestanding
microphone where the palynologist tells the computer what
to record. In addition, EcoCount uses the Microsoft API to
enable a talkback function so that the software can engage
with the palynologist either through the speakers or head-
phones. On recognition of a phrase such as "Count Tilia,
Count Good," the talkback function says what the computer
has understood in the form of "Count Tilia, Count Good."
This informs the palynologist of the action and enables him
or her to undo that count if necessary by saying the command
"Edit undo."
EcoCount operates on a simple spreadsheet format, with
each taxon listed in individual cells. These cells can be
included or excluded from the total count via a tick box being
activated. The palynologist first creates a dictionary of taxa
by adding in all the pollen and spore types they expect to
observe. Once the dictionary has been created, this can be
kept as a template file for expedient deployment in succes-
sive counts. Subsequent taxa types can be quickly added in
during the counting and identification phase. The taxa names
are entered into the sheet, via the sub menu (Figure 2).
Following the addition of new pollen type(s), the program is
then restarted and the computer will instantly recognize and
use the recently added pollen type.
The data can be entered into the spreadsheet via two ways.
First, manually--The palynologist adds information by
looking up each taxon in the spreadsheet and uses a mouse to
input the value.
Each taxa cell can be increased and decreased by an incre-
ment of one, when the curser is placed on the corresponding
taxa row and double clicked. If a value has been entered into
the wrong cell, right click and choose decrement. This pro-
cess of physically finding the correct taxa remains relatively

inefficient but does generate a digital file, which makes data
transfer into Tilia/TGView (Grimm, 1992, 2004) convenient.
The spreadsheet can list the taxa in alphabetical order, which
is optional, and also has a time stamp displayed to tell the
palynologist when the last values were added into a cell. Yet
this method represents time and resource management issues,
and is not the preferential use of EcoCount.
Second, automatically--Information is added via the
voice recognition option within EcoCount.
The palynologist turns on the listening function and tells
the computer what pollen or spores and their preservation
condition the operator has identified, for example, "count
Betula" and "count Good." The palynologist prefixes the
word that he or she wants the computer to record with the
command "count"; this makes the computer listen at a spe-
cific time. Even if the EcoCount program is left unattended
in "listen" mode, the computer will not record data until the
"count" command is heard; this function reduces the chance
of background noise being mistakenly recorded by the com-
puter and attributed to a pollen taxon. Each time a pollen
type is spoken, it is automatically added into the correspond-
ing taxa cell in the spreadsheet, by an increment of one.
There is a playback function that repeats the last taxa and
preservation condition recorded by the computer
to the palynologist; this function insures the correct taxa is
recognized and recorded by the computer. Therefore, if it
was a mistake, the command "edit undo," removes the last
taxa added in. New taxa can be added into the spreadsheet at
any time during the count following a simple save and restart
procedure. Therefore, identification of taxa not included in
the original dictionary template is not an issue. All pollen
types recorded are automatically entered into a total count
tally; thus, the palynologist knows when the minimal count
goal has been met. Cells for the pollen preservation and
unidentified pollen grains are located within the spreadsheet
window (Figure 2); however, these values are not included in
the total count. The preservation nomenclature of Good,
Crumpled, Corroded, and Ruptured used in EcoCount has
followed the categories proposed by Jones et al (2007). Due
to the unfamiliar marriage of botanical names and a synthetic
voice, there is a "read word" function that allows the opera-
tor to hear how the computer listens to words.
Discussion
The software described here for recording pollen is user-
friendly, accurate, consistent, and very efficient. Following
initial development, this program was tested and used within

a university and private consultancy laboratory setting, and
we find EcoCount to be a very robust and dependable piece
of software. One logistical distinction of this package is the
ease with which it can be loaded onto a Mac and PC plat-
form. The simple application of this software to pre-existing
laboratory computers renders purchases of specific comput-
ers redundant. In addition, when a computer is upgraded or
changed, the transfer of this software is a relatively simple
process. Once installed, the ease at which the investigator
can become expert makes EcoCount more efficient and
effective than the traditional data recording techniques. The
oral connection with the software means the investigator
continues to interact with the growing data set, and by
default, this action allows the time for the data to be mentally
worked up by the investigator prior to the completed spread-
sheet stage. This continued level of data interaction assures
that familiarity with the range of pollen grains is vigorous
and unexpected occurrences can be readily identified and
explored. The digital count sheet is saved as a .txt file, which
can be quickly opened in Excel, which in turn can be opened
or imported directly into Tilia/TGView (Grimm, 1992,
2004). We find that the playback feature, where the computer
immediately repeats the last recorded name, was exception-
ally useful as it allows real-time error correction. Many
researchers have been tired when operating a microscope and
recorded something different to what was identified. Real-
time oral playback for correct data recording is a more effec-
tive method for reduction of error compared with manual
recording, where a mark is made against the wrong box or
the wrong counter is selected, producing a false record that
can result in potentially serious consequences. In addition,
errors created by the operator have been known to occur dur-
ing the process of manually transferring the data from a
paper count sheet record into a spreadsheet or directly into
Tilia/TGView (Grimm, 1992, 2004). Therefore, the playback
feature is a simple safeguard that allows users the chance to
realize their mistakes before it becomes a permanent error.
The playback function also established a reinforced connec-
tivity with the data that allowed the user to develop a detailed
and comprehensive mental picture of the developing data set.
When an entry into the spreadsheet is made, the time is also
recorded. Therefore, we have begun to generate a pollen map
of the microscope slide. Analysis of the time stamp map may
reveal hitherto unobserved patterns of preferential pollen
dispersal in different materials, for example, silicon and
glycerin. We imagine that the best form of potential develop-
ment for this software, applications, and functions must
come from the community of users. The advantage of using
the EcoCount program is that digital copies are instantly pro-
duced while counting and therefore, make the operation of
data inputting from paper count sheets redundant. The pro-
duction of digital files also allows collation of data for stor-
age and archiving very simple and files can be placed within
secure storage as a routine end of day activity. EcoCount was
designed with pollen analysis in mind; however, due to the
ease of entering taxonomic names into the cells, the program
can be adapted for any type of counting analysis, for exam-
ple, diatoms, foraminifera, and plant macrofossils.
Demonstrating a quantified increase in efficiency during a
pollen count due to using EcoCount has been exceptionally
difficult. To date, replicating a pollen count to compare using
EcoCount against traditional recording methods has been
unsuccessful. Pollen samples can be immersed in silica oil to
be viewed on a microscope slide. The silica fluid is a mate-
rial that allows the palynologist to physically rotate grains
through 360° planes to observe subtle characteristics that aid
identification. When pollen are rotated, one consequence is
that the grains often move to different locations on the micro-
scope slide, especially if the cover slip is not sealed into
place. Therefore, attempting to identify and count the exact
same grains has been remarkably challenging. Replicating a
pollen count is possible; however, the emphasis of these tests
has been to compare the sums of each identified taxon to
examine the pollen ratios per slide. Therefore, quantitate
comparative analysis of the time allocation for the different
recording techniques are problematic. Consequently, we
have used a qualitative account based on feedback from use
of EcoCount in an academic and private consultancy labora-
tory environment. The view was that using EcoCount saved
time during the recording phase of the pollen count and by
not turning away from the microscope, the feeling of fatigue
at the end of a count session was reduced.
Conclusion
Until a full automated, reliable, and economically viable pol-
len counting package is readily available, pollen analysis
will remain a labor-intensive and time-consuming activity. If
an adaptation to a procedural technique is utilized, the effi-
ciency of the process can be improved. Identification of the
palynomorph can be a time sink; however, methods for
recording the information can and have been improved. A
current widely used technique for data capture is time-con-
suming and prone to error. Although we acknowledge the
value of basic technology, pen and paper, EcoCount repre-
sents a procedural adaptation that can make one facet of pol-
len analysis more effective and economical. The adoption of
a voice activated fully customizable digital count sheet
allows the investigator the opportunity to remain engaged
with the critical task, identification, for longer, utilizing his
or her efforts more efficiently. EcoCount is economical as
the trial version is free, and a full license is less than US$20.
The versatility of the EcoCount software package allows the
investigator to remain interactive with the developing data
set and has functions that can reduce the potential for errors
being recorded in the data set. The continued engagement
with the data set allows the investigator the time and oppor-
tunity to work up a mental picture of the data present on the
slide or within the sample. The digital file format further
enhances simple and expedient data transfer and storage.
