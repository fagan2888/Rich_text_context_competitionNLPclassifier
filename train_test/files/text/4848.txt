Abstract: Life history theory (LHT) is a powerful framework for examining relationship
choices and other behavioral strategies which integrates evolutionary, ecological, and
socio-developmental perspectives. We examine the relationship between psychological and
behavioral indicators of women's life history attributes and hypothetical relationship
choices with characters representing short-term and long-term male sexual strategies. We
demonstrate that psychological indicators of women's life history strategies are related to
predicted and actual behaviors in mating relationships. Women with insecure attachment
styles, especially those with negative evaluations of both themselves and others (fearful
attachment), were more likely to consider men with attributes indicating short-term mating
strategies for short-term and long-term relationships than women with a secure attachment
style. Women with relatively unrestricted sociosexuality were more likely to predict they
would have sexual affairs with men in general, with the tendency being generally stronger
when considering men with attributes indicating short-term mating strategies. Those who
scored high on self-monitoring were also more likely to predict having sexual affairs and
short-term relationships with these men. These and other findings demonstrate the
usefulness of a life history approach for understanding women's relationship choices.

Introduction
The psychological study of mating relationships is enhanced by the integration of a
life history framework. Life history theory (LHT) is the study of life cycles and life history
traits in an ecological context (Chisholm, 1999), integrating evolutionary, ecological, and
socio-developmental perspectives in the study of sex differences in developmental patterns
(Geary, 2002). Our study indicates the correspondence of psychological indicators of
Women's life history and mating preferences
women's life history attributes with hypothetical and actual behaviors in mating
relationships.
The human pair bond is unusual for a mammalian species; the majority of
mammalian males pursue solely short-term liaisons without paternal investment because it
is advantageous for them to invest exclusively in mating effort (Clutton-Brock, 1989; Daly
and Wilson, 1978; Trivers, 1972). Despite the large number of potential alternative mates,
both men and women generally allocate a considerable amount of reproductive effort to
parenting. This may occur because human infants and children require considerably more
care than those of our primate relatives (Fisher, 1992); children who grow up without a
father suffer higher mortality rates, especially in pre-industrial societies (Geary, 1998; Hill
and Hurtado, 1994). It may be in women's interests to pursue primarily long-term
relationships that allow such investments.
Numerous studies show that women are attracted to men who are socially respected,
financially stable, older, wealthy, ambitious, industrious, dependable, emotionally stable,
and romantic (e.g., Ardener, Ardener, and Warmington, 1960; Buss, 1989, 1994; Feingold,
1992; Kenrick and Simpson, 1997; Townsend, 1987, 1989; Townsend and Roberts, 1993;
Wiederman and Allgeier, 1992), attributes that suggest the potential for long-term
investment in a relationship and offspring (Buss, 1994). Although women may prefer these
traits in potential fathers, not all men possess these attributes. Men reliably show a clear
desire for sexual variety (Buss, 1994; Schmitt et al., 2003), and seek more mates for sexual
relations than women (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).
Male reproductive success benefits from short-term sexual relationships because
even a brief sexual tryst may increase the number of a man's descendents. The male bias of
mating effort over paternal investment leads males to be less selective about particular
features of females than vice versa. In humans, women make greater pre- and post-natal
contributions of resources (Fisher, 1992); the mother provides the cytoplasm, pregnancy,
breast milk, and the majority of care for small children. Women became increasingly more
burdened by child care as humans' span of development elongated. Across species, male
reproductive success varies more than that of females (e.g., Hall and DeVore, 1965; Jacobs,
1955; LeBoeuf and Peterson, 1969; Savage, 1961). Males can have many offspring via
multiple females; however females are limited to having one pregnancy at a time. Thus,
women are more selective about partners for sexual relationships than men in response to
their significantly lower reproductive ceiling (Trivers, 1972).
However, despite the dramatic sex differences in the costs and benefits of short-
term mating, women still seek short-term mates. Why should a woman mate with a man
who is unlikely to help her in bearing and raising their offspring? Fisher (1930) proposed
that women's offspring would benefit from men who could provide high-quality genes
promoting health, attractiveness to the opposite sex, and ultimately reproductive success.
The related "sexy son hypothesis" predicts that women have evolved tendencies to prefer
men with phenotypic indicators of high genetic quality to those with cues of high potential
paternal investment when obtaining reliable paternal investment is unlikely (e.g.,
Gangestad and Simpson, 2000).
Women may also have short-term sexual relations with men in exchange for
resource provisioning, especially when they are caring for children and in need of
investment (Lancaster, 1989; Wyatt, Forge, and Guthrie, 1998). In the Ache and Barí
societies of South America, women have sex with men who are not their social partners,

Women's life history and mating preferences
especially after they become pregnant. This may serve to confuse paternity, as these men
become secondary fathers who are socially obligated to protect and invest in the woman's
children. As a result, their contributions raise the children's survival rate (Beckerman et al.,
1998; Hill and Hurtado, 1996).
However, the majority of women do tend to prefer males who have observable
characteristics signaling high levels of genetic fitness for short-term relationships (Kruger,
Fisher, and Jobling, 2003; Kruger, 2006). Although long-term partners would also
contribute genetic fitness to offspring, these attributes are not nearly as important to women
when they are choosing long-term mates (Kruger, et al., 2003; Kruger, 2006). Women
express higher expectations for a partner's attractiveness when considering a one-night
stand than for a steady dating relationship (Kenrick, Groth, Trost, and Sadalla, 1993). In a
study of female law students, not one would consider an attractive man with low socio-
economic status for marriage, although some would agree to have sex with him. They
always preferred marriage to sex with a high socio-economic status man, whether he was
attractive or not (Townsend and Roberts, 1993).
Patricia Draper and her colleagues argue that men have evolved to specialize in
either short-term "cad" or long-term "dad" mating strategies (Belsky, Steinberg, and
Draper, 1991; Draper and Belsky 1990; Draper and Harpending 1982, 1988). Cads
resemble a "sexy son" strategy, attracting women by showing that they are highly
competitive, dominant, brave, aggressive, high in risk-taking, and rebellious, and
presumably, they will produce sons with similar characteristics. Dads attract women
because they are compassionate, kind, romantic, and industrious, demonstrating the ability
and willingness to invest in the relationship and parentally invest in potential children.
Cross-culturally, cads and dads show distinct clusters of personality traits reflecting
attributes women respectively value in men for short-term and long-term relationships (see
Draper and Belsky, 1990).
Belsky et al. (1991) propose that cads and dads follow developmental trajectories
triggered by the absence or presence of a father, respectively. They have amassed cross-
cultural evidence that men who experienced father absence favor a sexually promiscuous
mating strategy, are misogynistic and reluctant to engage in parental investment, and are
violent, aggressive, rebellious, high in risk-taking, and at high risk of incarceration. Men
who grew up in father-present households are more likely to delay sexual experience, have
positive attitudes towards and develop stable pair-bonds with women, have good relations
with male peers, and accept authority (Draper and Harpending 1982, 1988; Draper and
Belsky 1990).
Bowlby (1969) believed that one's early social experiences make a substantial
impact on one's personality and behavior as an adult. Children who feel loved and
welcomed by their parents experience "secure attachment;" and those who feel unloved and
unwelcomed experience one of the forms of "insecure attachment." He formed his theories,
in part, from observations that early and impulsive displays of sexual and aggressive
behavior were most prevalent in individuals who had experienced disturbed family
relations (Chisholm, 1999). More recently, Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper (1991) have
proposed that the attachment process is an evolved psychological mechanism to evaluate
life conditions and choose an appropriate reproductive strategy in one's environment. Thus,
insecure attachment is a response to environmental cues that long-term monogamous
relationships are not a viable strategy in the social world in which the child is growing up.

Women's life history and mating preferences
In a stressful or hazardous environment, one's early childhood is more likely to be
characterized by psychological stress, due to the lessened abilities or attention of parents,
leading to insecure attachment styles and short-term mating strategies.
This theory explains empirical findings that women who grow up in father-absent
households, a major risk factor for insecure attachment, show earlier sexual activity, as well
as a lack of interest or ability to form and/or maintain, long-term monogamous
relationships (Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper 1991, Chisholm, 1999). Women who have a
warm relationship with their fathers as children and have a father who is highly invested in
the family reach menarche later than those with an emotionally distant or absent father
(Ellis, McFadyen-Ketchum, Dodge, Pettit, and Bates, 1999). A chronically risky and
uncertain environment, as well as family conflict, is associated with earlier menarche,
earlier ages of reproduction, and higher reproductive rates (Chisholm, 1999; Kim, Smith,
and Palermiti, 1997). Note that earlier menarche is also associated with better nutrition
(Haq, 1984).
Some portion of life history strategy may be heritable because twin studies
indicated that genes typically account for 50% of the variance in most personality traits
(e.g., Jang, McCrae, Angleitner, Riemann, and Livesley, 1998). Researchers have identified
a complex interaction between genetic variation and environmental conditions and
conclude that behavioral tendencies are contingent on both components (Hill, Ross, and
Low, 1997). The Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper (1991) model has been challenged with the
argument that heritable socio-sexuality accounts for the relationship between father absence
and early sexual activity in daughters. Some have suggested that one mechanism is
heritable variation in the X-linked androgen receptor gene (AR), which determines
sensitivity to testosterone. Gottlieb, Beitel, Lumbroso, Pinsky and Trifiro, (1999) reported
nearly 400 AR gene mutations. One study tested whether the relationship between parental
separation and reproductive pattern was mediated through variation in the AR gene.
Although relationship patterns were partially due to heritability, this did not completely
account for the effects of father absence (Comings, Muhleman, Johnson, and MacMurray,
2002). Also, the connection between parental separation and reproductive development was
found independently of socioeconomic status and mothers' reproductive behavior (Quinlan,
2003).
Securely attached adults are more likely to describe their major adult romantic
relationships as happy, friendly, and trusting, and to have fewer and longer lasting
relationships than those who are insecurely attached (Hazan and Shaver, 1987). Unmarried
university students who were insecurely attached had significantly more negative
expectations of their parenting abilities and about children (Rholes et al. 1997). These
predictions may be accurate, as attachment style does indeed appear to affect parenting
effectiveness. For example, women who report a divorce, death, or long-term separation in
their families are more likely to be teenage mothers, and to talk, look, and touch their
babies significantly less than other mothers (Hall, Pawlby, and Wolkind 1979), thus setting
the stage for insecure attachment in their own offspring.
Additional psychological constructs may be related to life history. Sociosexuality is
defined as an individual's perception of the requirements in terms of time, attachment, and
commitment for having a sexual relationship (Gangestad and Simpson, 1990). Females
with restrictive sociosexuality have higher requirements than unrestricted females, and are
more likely to enhance their reproductive success by obtaining paternal investment.
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(2). 2008. -292-
Women's life history and mating preferences
Unrestrictive females are more likely to follow the "sexy son" strategy, and their offspring
may benefit through the quality of their mate's genes. Gangestad and Simpson (1992)
demonstrated that restrictive females value personal and parenting qualities more so than
attractiveness and social visibility, whereas the reverse pattern was true for unrestricted
females.
Self-monitoring may also be related to mating strategies (Snyder and Gangestad,
1986). High self-monitors regulate their self-presentation in the hope of radiating the
desired social appearance, low self-monitors express inner states at the expense of
presentation. Individuals with high self-monitoring tend to not establish committed
relationships and maintain an unrestrictive sexual orientation (Snyder and Simpson, 1984;
Snyder, Simpson, and Gangestad, 1986). Those with low self-monitoring tend to establish
committed relationships and maintain a restrictive sexual orientation.
Life history theory predicts that individuals who develop in relatively more
uncertain environments will develop riskier, short-term, behavioral strategies than
individuals who develop in stable surroundings (Chisholm 1999; Roff 1992; Stearns 1992).
In these environments, the most pressing adaptive problem faced by individuals may be
avoiding death. When mortality rates are low and predictable, there are fewer urgent
adaptive problems and a less risky, long-term strategy is optimal. Psychological measures
of time perspective may tap into these features of life history. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999)
have constructed scales to measure five factors of an individual's time perspective, which
they consider a pervasive, powerful, and largely unrecognized influence on human
behavior. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) found that sensation seeking was correlated with
present-hedonic orientation (hedonism and risk taking) and inversely related to future
orientation (striving for future goals and rewards, rather than immediate gratification).
Consideration for future consequences mirrored future orientation, and was inversely
related to present-hedonistic orientation.
We have recently developed an additional psychological instrument that may be
useful in examining women's life history strategies (Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling, 2003),
based on the correspondence between the personality traits of proper and dark (or Byronic
or Romantic) heroes of late 18th and early 19th century British Romantic literature and the
attributes of dad and cad mating strategies. Proper heroes exemplify long-term mating
strategies with reliable paternal investment in offspring; these men are typically law-
abiding, compassionate, kind, and monogamous. Dark heroes maximize their reproductive
success by having many short-term relationships without parental investment; these
characters are socially dominant, rebellious, frequently criminals (although often justified
by a tyrannical government), and often promiscuous. We found that women's tendencies to
choose dark hero cads over proper hero dads for a hypothetical relationship increased as the
relationship length decreased, following the type of investment (parental vs. genetic)
valued in each type of relationship (Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling, 2003).
We currently predict that women with insecure attachment styles, suggesting an
unreliable developmental environment and the consequential tendency towards short-term
mating strategies, will have a stronger tendency to form relationships with cads. They may
follow a strategy designed to maximize their immediate reproductive success by obtaining
high quality genes for offspring, rather than deferring their sexual involvement until they
are relatively certain of extended paternal investment in a long-term relationship.

Women's life history and mating preferences
Moreover, we predict that the likelihood of engaging in brief sexual relationships
with dads and cads will be elevated for women with unrestricted sociosexuality, and that
these women will be more likely to consider short-term and long-term relationships with
cads. Simpson and Gangestad (1991) found that women with a reported history of
relatively unrestricted sexual relations were more prone to care about a partner's sexual
appeal and attractiveness, and less about personality in terms of kindness, understanding,
beliefs and faithfulness. Women who score higher in self-monitoring are also expected to
follow this pattern.
We further predict that women whose time perspectives encourage short-term
mating strategies, those high in present hedonism, will be more likely to predict having
relationships with cads. Those high in future orientation will exhibit the reverse pattern.
Women who reached menarche earlier, one indicator of environmental uncertainty
accompanied by less reliable social and familial support, should also have a greater
tendency to choose cads for relationships. Finally, we predict that women who score higher
on indicators reflecting short-term life-history strategies will exhibit behaviors reflecting
these strategies: they will on average report having more short-term relationships, more
partners in the last year, more one time partners, and a greater propensity to cheat on their
primary partners than those women whose scores suggest longer-term strategies.
Materials and Methods
Ethnically diverse (61% indicated some non-Western European ancestry) female
undergraduates (N = 291; M age = 18.91, SD age = 1.18) at a large Midwestern-American
university participated to fulfill a course requirement. Participants completed surveys at
their convenience over the Internet, which included the Experiences in Close Relationships
(ECR) inventory (Brennan, Clark, and Shaver, 1998) to assess attachment style, the Future
Orientation and Present-Hedonistic scales from the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory
(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), items measuring socio-sexuality (Simpson and Gangestad,
1991), self-monitoring (Snyder and Gangestad, 1986), and a hypothetical version of an
experiment asking how likely participants would be to have sex with an attractive stranger
(Clark and Hatfield, 1989). Participants indicated the age at which they reached menarche
and the number of times they have cheated on their partners. Participants read descriptive
passages (200-300 words) of a prototypical proper hero dad, from Waverley (1814) by
Walter Scott, and a prototypical dark hero cad, George Staunton from The Heart of
Midlothian (1818) also by Walter Scott. Vocabulary keys defining several archaic or arcane
words or phrases were included for each passage.
Participants rated how likely they would be to have long-term committed, short-
term, and brief sexual relationships with each character. We correlated scores on life
history indicators with hypothetical relationship choices and behaviors in actual
relationships. We assigned participants to one of Bartholomew and Horowitz's (1991)
attachment style categories with computations from the Experiences in Close Relationships
(ECR) scale (See Brennan, Clark, and Shaver, 1998) and conducted an Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) on the likelihood of relationships with the cad. These attachment style
categories are based on the positivity or negativity of scores from two dimensions:
evaluation of the self and evaluation of others as accepting and responsive. The categories

Women's life history and mating preferences
are secure (positive self, positive others), preoccupied (negative self, negative others),
dismissing (positive self, negative others), and fearful (negative self, negative others).
Results
Women who scored higher on ECR-avoidance were most likely to say they would
have short-term and long-term committed relationships with the cad (See Table 1). Women
who scored higher on ECR-anxiety were most likely to say they would have a: brief sexual
affair with the dad, brief sexual affair with the cad, short-term relationship with a cad, and a
long-term committed relationship with a cad. Women who differed in attachment styles
significantly differed in their estimated likelihood of having a short-term relationship with a
cad, F(3,285) = 2.81, p = .04; and in their estimated likelihood of a long-term committed
relationship with a cad, F(3,285) = 4.71, p = .003 (See Figure 1).

Participants' socio-sexuality scores were positively correlated with their stated
likelihoods of having sexual affairs with dads, and sexual affairs, short-term relationships,
and long-term committed relationships with cads. Scores were also correlated with
estimated likelihoods of short-term relationships with dads, but not long-term committed
relationships with dads (see Table 1). The participants' numbers of sex partners in the past
12 months, numbers of one-time sex partners, and number of partners that participants
desired to have in the next five years were all positively correlated with their stated
likelihoods of having sexual affairs with dads, and sexual affairs, short-term, and long-term
relationships with cads (See Table 2).

Women who scored higher on self-monitoring were more likely to say they would
have a sexual affair and a short-term relationship with the cad (see Table 2). Women who
reported a greater likelihood of having sex with an attractive stranger were more likely to
say they would have a sexual affair with the dad, a sexual affair with the cad, and a short-
term relationship with the cad. Participants scoring high on the present hedonistic
dimension perceived sexual affairs with the dad and the cad as more likely to occur (see
Table 3). The tendency for women scoring high on future orientation to perceive sexual
affairs with the cad as less likely approached but did not reach statistical significance,

Avoidance scores (indicating insecure attachment) were inversely associated with
the number of long-term relationships participants have formed (See Table 3). Anxiety
scores (indicating insecure attachment) were positively associated with the number of
partners in the past 12 months, as well as participants' number of one-time partners. Those
who scored higher in sociosexuality had more long-term partners, more partners in the past
12 months, more one-time partners, and cheated on their partners more often than those
who scored lower. Higher scores on self-monitoring were associated with having more
long-term and short-term partners. Higher degrees of present hedonism were associated
with having more long-term and short-term partners, more partners in the past 12 months,
more one-time partners, and greater incidence of cheating behaviors. Future time
perspective was not associated with any of the behavioral measures.
Discussion
Our results indicate the value of a life history framework for understanding
women's mating choices. Women with insecure attachment styles, especially those with
negative evaluations of both themselves and others (fearful attachment), were more likely
to consider cads for short-term and long-term relationships than women with a secure
attachment style. This lends support to the causal framework proposed by Belsky,
Steinberg, and Draper (1991), where psychological mechanisms following from
unpredictability in one's early social environment promote tendencies towards short-term
mating strategies later in life.
Women with relatively unrestricted sociosexuality were more likely than those with
restricted sociosexuality to predict sexual affairs with dads and cads, with the tendency
being generally stronger for cads. Relatively unrestricted women were also more likely to
consider both short-term and long-term relationships with cads, across multiple indicators
of sociosexuality. The frequency with which the women had cheated on their partners was
also significantly correlated with the likelihood of sex with the dad and of all types of
relationships with the cad. None of these measures were significantly related to the
likelihood of a long-term committed relationship with the dad. Also, as predicted by our
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(2). 2008. -297-
Women's life history and mating preferences
evolutionary framework, those who scored high on self-monitoring were more likely to
predict they would have sexual affairs and short-term relationships with the cad.
The relationship between time perspective and mating preference was not as
comprehensive as expected, but all significant relationships were in the predicted direction.
Present hedonistic orientation was positively related to the likelihood of brief sexual affairs
with both dads and cads. There was an inverse relationship between future orientation and
the likelihood of having a brief sexual affair with the cad, but this did not reach
significance.
Psychological indicators of life history strategies were also correlated with rates of
actual behaviors, such as: the number of short-term and long-term relationships participants
have experienced, the number of partners they have had in the past 12 months, the number
of one-time partners, and even the frequency of cheating behavior. Although the strength of
the findings with the life history indicators may appear small, they are near the mean effect
size of social psychological research. Cohen (1988) indicated that a correlation of .30 was a
moderate effect in psychological research; Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota (2003) found
that the mean effect size for published social psychological research translated into a
correlation of r = .21. It is likely that stronger effects would be found with a sample more
representative of the general population. The socio-economic background and age range of
undergraduate participants attending a highly selective university is probably constricted.
It is notable that women with more unrestricted sociosexuality and shorter time
horizons were more likely to predict short-term sexual relations with both the cad and the
dad. This suggests that the benefits of resource provisioning may complement the benefits
of high quality genes in brief sexual relationships, as both dads and cads may provide
material support for the duration of the relationship. Also, the preferences that women
express as college students do not necessarily correspond with those possessed by the
individual they will chose as a partner for a long-term relationship (See Todd, Penke,
Fasolo, and Lenton, 2007). In fact, women attending college may explore their options and
take opportunities to have relationships with men who they would not actually consider for
marriage.
One may be puzzled by the results concerning longer term relationships with cads.
If cads are valuable for their genetic investment, why would women with riskier life history
strategies seek them for long-term relationships? The psychological mechanism promoting
an adaptive strategy could vary, as long as it reliably leads to the adaptive behaviors.
Women may fully intend to have long-term committed relationships with cads, whether or
not this actually happens. Modern day mass-market romance novels feature cad like
characters who are ultimately tamed into long-term relationships by the female protagonist
(Barash and Barash, 2005; Salmon and Symons, 2003). It is not surprising that this "best of
both worlds" outcome makes for such popular reading.
Women may also use short-term sexual relationships to assess and demonstrate
their competitiveness in the mating marketplace (Townsend, 1999). Although ancestral
women did not benefit as much as men did from a high quantity of partners, they may
compete with each other for high quality partners. This competition may be especially
important in a nominally monogamous society, from which the respondent sample derives.
Our experiment elucidates the usefulness of a life history approach for
understanding women's relationship choices. This integrative framework holds the promise
of advancing developmental and social psychology, as well as uniting psychology with

other fields and levels of analysis. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the dad and cad
experimental paradigm for illustrating women's mating strategies.
