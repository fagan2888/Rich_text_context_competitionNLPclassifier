As a way to examine the nature of age-related differences in lineup identification accuracy, young (16­33 years)
and older (60­82 years) witnesses viewed two similar videotaped incidents, one involving a young perpetrator and
the other involving an older perpetrator. The incidents were followed by two separate lineups, one for the younger
perpetrator and one for the older perpetrator. When the test delay was short (35 min), the young and older
witnesses performed similarly on the lineups, but when the tests were delayed by 1 week, the older witnesses were
substantially less accurate. When the target was absent from the lineups, the older witnesses made more false
alarm errors, particularly when the faces were young. When the target was present in the lineups, correct
identifications by both young and older witnesses were positively correlated with a measure of source recollection
derived from a separate face-recognition task. Older witnesses scored poorly on this measure, suggesting that
source-recollection deficits are partially responsible for age-related differences in performance on the lineup task.
ONE striking and ecologically valid test of memory is
provided by performance on a lineup test following a
witnessed incident. An eyewitness's decision in the lineup task
is likely to be influenced by several variables, including the
conditions at the time of encoding, the characteristics of the test
situation, the personal characteristics of the witness, and
the characteristics of the event (for reviews, see Memon, Vrij,
& Bull, 2003; Wright & Davies, 1999). One particularly im-
portant factor, however, and one with clear implications for
memory, is the age of the eyewitness (Memon & Bartlett, 2002;
Memon, Hope, Bartlett, & Bull, 2002; Searcy, Bartlett, &
Memon, 1999, 2000; Searcy, Bartlett, Memon, & Swanson,
2001; Searcy, Bartlett, & Seipel, 2000).
In one relevant study (Searcy et al., 1999), younger (18- to
30-year-old) and older (60- to 80-year-old) witnesses viewed
a crime video, after which they were asked to identify the per-
petrator in a photo-identification lineup. Consistent with predic-
tions based on standard laboratory tests of face-recognition
memory (Bartlett & Fulton, 1991; Bartlett, Strater, & Fulton,
1991; Smith & Winograd, 1978), older participants made more
false choices of a lineup ``foil'' than did younger participants.
The age-related increase in false identifications has been repli-
cated in several subsequent studies, many of which have also
reported an age-related reduction in the hit rate (Searcy,
Bartlett, & Memon, 2000; Searcy, Bartlett, & Seipel, 2000;
Searcy et al., 2001; Memon et al., 2002; Memon & Bartlett,
2002).
Although age-related deficits in lineup performance are now
well established, it is important to note that, in the studies cited,
all the lineup faces were young. Hence, the young witnesses
were tested with ``same-age'' faces, whereas the older witnesses
were tested with ``other-age'' faces. This confound is important
in light of the finding by Bartlett and Leslie (1986) that age-
related differences in face-recognition memory were reduced
when older faces were used: younger participants showed an
advantage with younger faces, whereas older adults showed no
effect of age of face. The same asymmetric other-age effect has
also been reported by Rodin (1987) and by Fulton and Bartlett
(1991; see also List, 1986, for related results). In Fulton and
Bartlett's study, however, the other-age effect was found with
``hits'' (correct recognitions of previously viewed faces), but
not with false alarms (erroneous recognitions of foil faces).
False alarms were more frequent among older participants,
regardless of age of face.
The possibility that an other-age effect might occur in the
context of eyewitness identification was examined by Wright
and Stroud (2002), who found that young-adult and middle-
aged viewers of target-present lineups were more accurate with
same-age faces than with other-age faces (i.e., middle-aged
faces for young viewers and young-adult faces for middle-aged
viewers). The other-age effect, however, was not found in
target-absent lineups, which is in partial agreement with Fulton
and Bartlett (1991). Wright and Stroud, however, did not
replicate the Fulton and Bartlett finding of higher false-alarm
rates among older viewers. This may be because the older par-
ticipants in the Wright and Stroud study ranged from 35 to 55
years old, whereas those in the Fulton and Bartlett study were all
over 60. Nonetheless, we are left with an unanswered question:
Are the inflated rates of false identification shown by persons
over the age of 60 restricted to lineups of young faces? The
question is important, because, from a forensic point of view,
we need to know whether older eyewitnesses are any more (or
less) reliable than young adults with lineups of older faces.
Moreover, from the standpoint of theory, it is time to answer
those critics who have suggested that current conceptions of
cognitive aging are too laboratory based to permit clear predic-
tions about real-life memory tasks, including eyewitness identifi-
cation (see Park, 2000, for a review). Any adequate theory of the
other-age effect must explain its occurrence, or failure to occur,
in real-life situations such as lineup identification. With these
considerations in mind, we designed a study to assess age dif-
ferences in lineup performance using both target-present and

target-absent lineups of both young-adult and older-adult faces
at each of two test delays (35 min and 1 week).
In addition to rectifying the age confound that made it
difficult to interpret some previously published findings, we also
sought to determine whether a currently influential hypothesis
for age differences in memory could be applied to the lineup
task. A number of theorists have recently argued that many
age differences in memory occur because older people have
more difficulty in recalling contextual and perceptual details
that specify the ``source'' of retrieved information (Johnson,
Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993; Spencer & Raz, 1995). Older
witnesses are therefore more likely to base their memory judg-
ments on generalized feelings of familiarity (Bartlett, 1993;
Bartlett et al., 1991; Dywan & Jacoby, 1990; Jennings &
Jacoby, 1997; Koutstaal, Schacter, Galluccio, & Stofer, 1999).
Several recent studies have suggested that deficient source
memory is a factor in age differences in face recognition, par-
ticularly age differences in false-alarm errors (Bartlett, 1993;
Searcy et al., 1999). Bartlett and Fulton (1991) have provided
evidence that false-alarm errors with entirely new faces reflect
an age-related increase in the use of familiarity for making
recognition judgments. Bartlett and his associates argued that,
because the set of human faces is highly homogenous, even
new faces will often seem familiar because of their resemblance
to faces seen in life. Recollection of source may aid in the
rejection of new-but-familiar-looking faces. Source recollection,
however, is impaired in old age, and this may be the reason
that false recognitions are increased in old age (Searcy et al.,
1999).
Although the source-recollection hypothesis has received
some support from research using standard laboratory para-
digms for the probing of face memory, there is as yet, to our
knowledge, no published evidence to confirm that source
recollection affects performance on lineups. In pursuit of such
evidence, we therefore examined the relation between lineup
performance and a laboratory task that is known to tap source
memory. The laboratory task was modeled on a study by
Jennings and Jacoby (1997), in which a study list of words was
followed by a recognition test in which the lure (new) items
were repeated at different intervals (lags). They found that
false-alarm rates were higher for repeated lures than for first-
time lures among older participants but not young adults. Thus,
their older participants showed a deficit in distinguishing old
items from repeated-lure items. Taken together with other
results (Jennings & Jacoby, 1993), this finding suggests an age-
related deficit in recollection of source information.
Extending the Jennings and Jacoby method to face
recognition, we expected to observe a similar age deficit in
distinguishing old items from repeated-lure items. Our principal
concern, however, was with whether this deficit in recollection
would show correlations with lineup performance. By the
source-recollection hypothesis, old versus repeated-lure dis-
crimination and lineup performance should be positively
correlated, at least in older witnesses. In contrast, old versus
nonrepeated-lure discrimination and lineup performance may
show no correlation with lineup performance, or, at best, a weak
correlation. Discrimination between old faces and nonrepeated
lures is likely to be based on familiarity information, at least
to a degree; and familiarity information, by our hypothesis, is
largely age invariant.
We considered that the source-recollection hypothesis would
be best tested by examining the effects of length of test delay on
the lineup performance of younger and older adults. There is
evidence that age-related source-memory impairments increase
over time (Brown, Jones, & Davis, 1995; Henkel, Johnson, &
DeLeonardis, 1998; Schacter, Kazniak, Kihlstrom, & Valdserri,
1991; see Yonelinas, 2002, for a review). Considering this
evidence in relation to our hypothesis that age-related deficits
in the lineup task reflect age-related deficits in recollection, we
can predict that older witnesses will show larger impairments in
lineup performance with longer test delays. Whereas delay is
a variable of great relevance to forensics, its effects in lineup
tasks remain largely unexplored (Kassin, Tubb, Hosch, &
Memon, 2001). The available evidence from laboratory studies
suggests that the effects of delay on face memory may vary
with the type of measure. For example, hit rates on a face-
recognition task may decline with delay, whereas the false-
alarm rates may show little change (Shepherd, 1983).
In contrast, Sporer (1992) found a decrease in hits and an
increase in false alarms over various intervals up to 3 weeks.
Moreover, in an eyewitness study, Gwyer and Clifford (1997)
noted little difference following a 48- or 96-hour delay on any
of their measures of eyewitness recall or recognition. A meta-
analysis of 128 studies of face recognition (80% laboratory
based) and 960 conditions suggests there is a linear decline in
hits to ``old'' faces after a delay and no clear effect of delay
on false alarms to ``new'' faces (Shapiro & Penrod, 1986). How-
ever, because none of these studies compared young adults with
older adults, they do not speak to the prediction of the source-
recollection hypothesis that age-related deficits in lineup
performance become more marked with increases in test delay.
In summary, in this study we examined age differences
in lineup performance with both young and older faces. We
tested the hypothesis (which was based on laboratory studies
such as that by Bartlett & Leslie, 1986) that the accuracy of
performance with target-present lineups will show an age-
related deficit, but that the size of this deficit will be reduced
with older faces. Additionally, we tested three predictions from
the hypothesis that older witnesses' problems in lineup per-
formance reflect age-related deficits in source recollection: first,
older adults will show deficits in a laboratory test of source
memory; second, performance on this test will be positively
correlated with performance on the lineup test; and third, age-
related differences in lineup performance will increase with
longer test delays.
METHODS
Participants
A total of 172 participants were tested (1 participant was
excluded from the data analysis; see Table 1). Eighty-four
young participants aged between 16 and 33 years (M ¼ 19.4
years) were recruited from local colleges, and 88 older partic-
ipants had responded to posters and advertisements placed in
local centers, clubs, and societies. The older participants were
60­82 years old (M ¼ 71.7 years). All participants reported that
they were in good health.
To determine the characteristics of our older sample,
we asked all older adults to take the Mini-Mental State
AGING AND EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION P339
Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975)
and complete the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Brink
et al., 1982). The GDS agrees well with clinical diagnoses and
symptom checklists (Yesavage et al., 1983). Finally, the
National Adult Reading Test, or NART (Nelson & O'Connell,
1978), was administered to all participants. Table 1 shows
participants' mean scores on these screening measures for each
combination of delay and lineup type.
Design
Age group (young or old), lineup presentation type (target
present or target absent), and delay were between-subject
factors. All participants viewed two lineups, one for the older
perpetrator, the other for the younger, the ordering of which
was counterbalanced. For 87 of the participants, both lineups
included the perpetrator; for the remaining 85 participants, the
perpetrator was absent from both lineups. Within each age group
and lineup-type condition, approximately half the participants
made their lineup judgments after a short delay of 35 min,
whereas the remainder made theirs after a longer delay of 1 week
(see Table 1).
Materials
Eyewitness events. --The incidents consisted of two separate
video clips of a young man aged 22 years (young-target con-
dition) or an older man aged 60 years (old-target condition)
apparently breaking into a house. In both clips, the perpetrator
followed the same script (which lasted for 50 s). The facial
exposure times were also equal (43 s). In each video, the man
rang the doorbell to establish if anyone was at home, went
through the side gate round to the back of the house, entered the
house through the back door, and a few seconds later emerged
from the front door carrying a camera. The purpose of the
successive presentation of the same incident was to obtain
a statistically powerful within-groups comparison between par-
ticipants' ability to recognize old and young faces.
Lineups. --Four lineups were constructed: A target-present
(TP) and a target-absent (TA) lineup for the young perpetrator
and a TP and TA lineup for the older perpetrator. The lineup
photographs consisted of 20 cm 3 26 cm colored full-face head
shots presented in a 3 3 2 array. The perpetrator's photograph
was taken a few days after the video so that hairstyle and other
external features appeared as they did on the video. Following
the recommendation of Wells (1993) that all lineup members
must match the eyewitness's prelineup description of the
perpetrator, 20 independent raters rated a pool of photographs
on a scale from 1 to 7 (where 7 ¼ a good match to the
description). The five faces that received the highest ratings
were selected as foils; a high-ranking foil was used for the
absent condition.
The lineup raters were drawn from technical and secretarial
staff at the University of Southampton, who ranged in age from
20 to 50 years. The lineup for the young perpetrator contained
foils ranging in age from 20 to 22 years. The lineup for the
older perpetrator contained foils ranging in age from 55 to 65
years. The lineups were presented simultaneously.
Face-source-recollection task. --The study list and test were
constructed from a pool of 200 facial photographs of young-
adult females unknown to the participants. The study list
included 48 faces that, on the basis of their appearance, three
independent raters had assigned to one of six different
occupational categories. There were 15 faces in each of two
large categories (teacher and nurse), 6 faces in each of two
medium categories (hairdresser and shop assistant), and 3 faces
in each of two small categories (model and housewife). (Color
coding was also used to ``cue'' the derived categories to our
participants both at study and at test. Thus, different
occupations were shown on different colored backgrounds.
Unfortunately, we did not counterbalance the assignment of
faces to category condition or old­new status in this study, so
the category size data are not presented here.)
The study list also included 15 faces that the raters did not
classify consistently, so there were 63 faces presented in all.
The randomly ordered recognition test comprised the 63 old
faces, plus 31 lures, including 3 lures from each of the six
categories and 13 noncategorized lures. Each lure was repeated
at a lag of either two or four photographs, creating three test
conditions: (a) old faces; (b) first-time-presented lures; and (c)
repeated lures. The participant's task was to decide whether
a face had been seen before or was new. The instructions
stressed that even repeated-lure faces should be classified as
``new.''
Procedure
Participants were randomly assigned to the delay or
immediate test condition, and individual test sessions lasted
approximately 40 min. Participants were informed they would
be watching two short video clips. After the video, participants
were presented with a large number of female faces, and they

aThree participants did not complete all the items of the MMSE and, as
a result, had scores that were below normal (cutoff score ¼ 24). All three,
however, had normal NART scores but had felt insulted by some of the ques-
tions in the MMSE. We therefore decided to retain those participants in the
data set. The GDS scores of seven of the older participants were indicative of
``mild'' depression. Another person, however, had a score in the ``severe'' cat-
egory, and it was decided to eliminate that person from the data set. The sta-
tistics shown apply to the reduced data set.

rated each face for pleasantness on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 ¼ very
pleasant).
The face-rating task was untimed and took approximately
10 min. The older participants then completed the MMSE and
took a 20-min break before completing the lineup and face-
recognition tasks (short delay group). Because the younger
participants did not complete the MMSE, they received
a slightly longer break than the older adults to ensure that the
delay between the face-recognition and lineup tasks (35 min)
was the same for both groups. Those in the long delay group
returned after 1 week to complete the lineup and face-recog-
nition tasks.
Each participant either viewed two lineups with the
perpetrators present, or two from which the perpetrators were
absent. The two tests were given in the same sequence as the
video clip, so that participants who saw the young-man video
first took the young lineup first. (Kendall's tau b correlations
were calculated to determine the effects, if any, of order of
lineup presentation, young or old first, and participants' choices
in the lineup, that is, hit, false alarm, or miss. There were no
significant correlations. The order in which the lineups were
presented may nevertheless have influenced participants' lineup
choices.)
The instructions were to look at each photograph carefully
and to indicate whether one of the faces belonged to the person
from the video. Participants were warned that hairstyle and
clothing might not look the same and that, ``just as in a real
lineup, the culprit may or may not be present.'' All participants
were then asked to indicate how certain they were (on a 1­7
scale) that they were correct in their lineup choice. The
procedure was repeated for the other video. The second part
of the faces task was then completed. (The recognition phase of
the face-source-recollection task took place at the very end
of the experiment. Although all our young participants com-
pleted the study phase of the faces task, because of class
timetable constraints, 29 of the younger participants did not
have time to complete the test phase.)
The participants were told that they would see a list of face
photographs, some of which they had seen in the first testing
session and some of which were new. They were asked to judge
each photograph as either ``old'' (seen in Session 1) or ``new''
(not seen in Session 1), and they were warned that new faces
might be repeated in the test. It was stressed that ``if a photo in
this second session is repeated, you should still respond `new'
because it is still a new photo in the second session.'' Older
participants then completed the GDS, and all participants also
completed a brief self-report questionnaire that asked them
whether each of the video events was a criminal act. One older
participant refused to complete the faces task because of
fatigue.
RESULTS
In this section, analyses are reported for several different
aspects of lineup performance: (a) the effects of age and delay
upon accuracy of performance summed over the two lineups;
(b) the proportions of correct and incorrect responses in the
younger and older lineups considered separately and the pro-
portions for the TP and TA conditions; and (c) the confidence
of the participants in their lineup decisions. Finally, we con-
sidered lineup performance in relation to measures of face-
source recollection.
Total Accuracy Scores
Because each participant viewed two lineups, a measure of
performance is the number of correct lineup judgments that a
participant made, which can take the values 0 (neither correct),
1 (one correct), or 2 (both correct), corresponding to the
proportions correct of 0, 0.5, and 1, respectively. The mean
proportions correct for the young and older participants (across
the short and long delay conditions) respectively were .43
(SD ¼ .38) and .25 (SD ¼ .32). The younger participants thus
outperformed the older participants: U ¼ 2,726; z ¼ 3.14; p ¼
.002 (Mann­Whitney test for ordinal data).
Table 2 shows that, in line with our predictions from the
source-recollection hypothesis, the effect of delay upon the
performance of the older adults was greater than that with
the young participants: that is, there appears to be a Delay 3
Age Group interaction. Because the dependent variable con-
sisted of categories rather than measurements, multinomial lo-
gistic regression was used to confirm the presence of a Delay 3
Age Group interaction: v2(6, N ¼ 171) ¼ 23.07, p , .001, and
Nagelkerke's R2 ¼ .145. This interaction is robust, both in the
TP condition, v2(6, N ¼ 87) ¼ 13.97, p ¼ 03, and Nagelkerke's
R2 ¼ .172, and in the TA condition, v2(6, N ¼ 84) ¼ 16.91, p ¼
.01, and R2 ¼ .210.
Proportions of Hits, False Alarms,
and Misses With the Young and Old Lineups
Table 3 provides a more detailed view of the data for the
TP condition. The entries are the proportions, for each of the
two lineups, of participants' choosing the perpetrator (hits),
choosing one of the foils (false alarms), and making no choice
(misses).
It is immediately apparent from inspection of Table 3 that,
with the young lineup, the older participants made more false-
alarm errors than did the younger participants. (The same
tendency can also be discerned in the data for the older lineup,
but it is much less marked there.) For this reason, the hit rates
were corrected to allow for the false-alarm rates (see Table 3 for
an explanation of the correction). It is clear, however, that both
the raw hit rates and the corrected hit rates were generally
higher in the young group than in the older group. (The partici-
pant-age differences in hit rates, however, are larger with the
old lineup than with the young lineup.)
Because each participant made judgments with both the
young and the old lineups, a separate multinomial logistic
regression was carried out on the data from the old and young

lineups. In each regression, the dependent variable was the
choice category (hit, false alarm, or miss) and the independent
variables were age group and delay. There were no reliable
effects of any kind for the older lineup: v2(6, N¼171)¼10.421
and p ¼ .108. In the data for the young lineup, however, it is
clear that the pattern of young participants' responses was dif-
ferent from that of the older participants: the young partici-
pants had a higher hit rate, a higher miss rate, and a lower
false-alarm rate. This pattern is confirmed by a significant
main effect of age: v2(2, N ¼ 171) ¼ 24.45, p , .001, and
R2 ¼ .150.
If, for the moment, we disregard the age of the participant
who is viewing the young lineup, it appears from Table 3 that
the introduction of a delay had little effect on the distribution of
hits, misses, and false-alarm rates: v2(2, N ¼ 171) ¼ 2.75 and
p ¼ .253. It is also clear, however, that the delay variable had
different (and quite complex) effects upon the distributions for
the younger and older participants: there is a significant Age 3
Delay interaction, at v2(6, N¼171)¼32.43, p , .001, and R2 ¼
.194. An increase in delay resulted in a greater loss of accuracy
(hits) in the older group of participants. The miss rate, in
contrast, increased in both groups. An increase in delay had
opposite effects upon the false-alarm rates in the two groups: in
younger participants, false alarms decreased; in older partic-
ipants, they increased.
Turning now to the data from the TA condition, we see that
Table 4 shows that, with the young lineup, age differences in
false alarms are greater in the delay condition than in the
immediate condition: v2(1, N ¼ 84) ¼ 5.72, p ¼ .017, and R2 ¼
.093. These data confirm the prior finding (Memon & Gabbert,
2003; Searcy et al., 1999, 2000) that, with young lineups, older
adults make more false choices in TA situations than do
younger adults. Beyond this, the results also show, for the first
time, that this age-related difference is increased with test delay.
The Age 3 Delay interaction is less evident in the data for the
older lineup and is not statistically reliable: v2(1, N¼84)¼1.69
and p ¼ .194.
Confidence and Accuracy
The younger participants were significantly more confident
in their decisions on younger lineups than were the older
participants: F(1,171) ¼ 3.72, MSE ¼ 8.48, and p ¼ .05. The
same comparison for the older lineup showed a nonsignificant
tendency for the younger participants to be more confident than
older participants: F(1,171) ¼ 3.10, MSE ¼ 8.14, and p ¼ .08.
An examination of confidence accuracy relationships in the
young participants and in the older participants showed only
one reliable correlation, namely, a positive relationship between
younger participants' ratings of confidence on the old lineup
and the accuracy of their decisions on that lineup: rpb
¼.29, N¼
84, and p ¼ .008. There was no effect of delay upon confidence
ratings.
Face-Source-Recollection Data
Table 5 shows the data from the face-recognition and source-
recollection test administered at the end of the experimental
sessions. ``Old'' judgments in response to old faces (hits) were
less frequent in the long delay condition than in the short delay
condition, but, as in much prior research (Searcy et al., 1999),
the hit rates did not differ significantly for young and older
witnesses (M ¼ 58 and M ¼ .55, respectively, in the short delay
condition, and M ¼ .51 and M ¼ .49, respectively, in the long
delay condition). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the hit
rates using age group and delay as between-groups factors
showed a main effect of test delay, F(1,127) ¼ 5.20, MSE ¼
.027, and p ¼ .03, but there was no participant-age effect, and
no Participant-Age 3 Delay interaction (F , 1).
Erroneous ``old'' judgments in response to new and new-
repeat items (false alarms) were also less frequent in the long
delay condition than in the short delay condition. Additionally,
consistent with what we found in our lineup data, false-alarm
rates for new faces were higher for older adults than younger
adults at both test delays (M ¼ .39 and M ¼ .26, respectively, in
the short delay condition, and M¼.34 and M¼.20, respectively,
in the long delay condition). False-alarm rates for new-repeat
faces showed a still stronger age-related increase: M ¼ .59 and
M¼.35 for old and young adults, respectively, in the short delay
condition and M ¼ .49 and M ¼ .25 for old and young adults,
respectively, in the long delay condition. We conclude that lure-
repetition increased false alarms, but this effect was stronger
among older adults (M differences ¼ .20 and .15 for the short
delay and long delay conditions, respectively) than among

Note: TP ¼ target present. Data are for proportions of hits, false alarms, misses (no choice was made), and corrected hits by young adults and older adults in
the short and long test delay groups with young and old lineups. Corrected hits are the hit rates ``corrected'' by subtraction of the false-alarm rates. (Because the
prior probability of choosing one of the 5 foils is five times that of choosing the perpetrator, the false-alarm rates were divided by 5 prior to subtraction.) Both
the ``raw'' hit rates and the corrected hit rates were generally higher in the young group than in the older group. However, the size of this age-related deficit was
much larger in the long delay than in the short delay condition. The ``corrected'' proportions are unsuited to formal testing because different participants contrib-
uted to the hits and false-alarm rates, which were combined in the correction.

ANOVA of the false-alarm rates with age and test delay as

MSE ¼ .05, and p , .001, and lure repetition, F(1,131) ¼ 68.1,
MSE¼.014, and p , .001; moreover, there was a reliable Age3
Lure-Repetition interaction: F(1,131)¼13.0, MSE¼.015, and p
, .001. The interaction is suggestive of an age-related deficit in
conscious recollection (cf. Jennings & Jacoby, 1997). More-
over, Table 5 shows that the young adults (but not the older
adults) could distinguish old-test faces from new-repeat faces. In
the young adult group, hit rates for old faces and false-alarm
rates for new-repeat faces averaged .55 and .30, respectively:
F(1,47) ¼ 75.8, MSE ¼ .02, and p , .001. In the older group,
they averaged .52 and .54, respectively (F , 1).
Relations of Source Memory to Lineup Performance
The principal question motivating this study was whether
recollection of source information is specifically related to
performance on lineups. To address it, we examined correla-
tions between lineup performance and two measures derived
from the face-recognition test. The source-memory measure
was the hit rate for old faces minus the false-alarm rate for new-
repeat faces, whereas the general face-recognition measure was
the hit rate for old faces minus the false-alarm rate for entirely
new faces. Distinguishing old faces from new-repeat faces
requires source recollection, whereas distinguishing old faces
from entirely new faces does not. Accuracy in the lineup task
was scored as 0, 1, or 2 correct identifications in the TP condi-
tion, and as 0, 1, or 2 correct rejections in the TA condition.
Table 6 shows the Goodman­Kruskal gamma correlations
between lineup accuracy and both measures derived from the
face-recognition test, with the data broken down by age group
as well as by lineup type (TP vs. TA). Pearson correlations
show precisely the same pattern. Lineup accuracy was reliably
correlated with source memory in the TP condition but not in
the TA condition, a finding that held in both the young and
older groups. By contrast, lineup accuracy and face memory
were not reliably correlated. These data indicate that accurate
identifications in TP lineups were linked to our participants'
source memory.
Perceptions of the Perpetrator
A self-report questionnaire asked participants what they
thought was going on in each of the two scenarios (i.e., the
young-man scenario and the older-man scenario). The young
man's behavior was viewed as suspicious by 82% of the older
participants, as compared with only 62% of the younger
witnesses: v2(2, N ¼ 171) ¼ 8.41 and p ¼ .01. In contrast, the
older man's behavior was viewed as suspicious by equal
percentages of older and younger witnesses (74% and 75%,
respectively). We conclude that older witnesses were relatively
more inclined to suspect the young man (though not the older
man) of criminal intent in the scenario used here.
DISCUSSION
The main purpose of the present study was to test the source-
recollection hypothesis in the context of lineup identification.
As predicted, age-related differences in lineup performance
increased when the lineup was delayed by 1 week: the over-
all accuracy measure showed a Participant-Age 3 Delay in-
teraction in both TP and TA conditions. Searcy and colleagues
(2001) reported that older participants had more difficulty in
identifying a person they had personally encountered some
5 weeks before the lineup test and speculated that long test
delays might put older eyewitnesses at a particular disadvan-
tage. The present findings confirm their speculation, in line with
the view that there are age-related deficits in source recollection
and that these deficits increase after longer test delays.
The source recollection hypothesis was further supported by
performance on the face-recognition and source-recollection
tasks. As expected, the young adults and the older adults did
not differ in correct recognition of previously seen faces (i.e.,
hit rates were age invariant). In line with our hypotheses, how-
ever, the older adults produced more false alarms in response to
new faces, particularly in the case of repeated presentations of
these new faces. In fact, among the older adults, new-repeated
faces drew as many false alarms as hits. Following Jennings
and Jacoby (1997), who obtained similar results with verbal
stimuli, we believe that high false-alarm rates for repeated-new
faces reflect problems in conscious recollection of information
about context or source. Our purpose, however, was not simply
to document further age-related deficits in recollection. Rather,
we wished to determine whether these deficits have any bearing
on the extent of older adults' difficulties with the lineup task.
To this end, we assessed the correlation between the accuracy of
performance in the lineup task and source memory in the face-
recognition task. We found that our measure of source memory
was reliably correlated with the accuracy of performance in the

TP lineup task. This finding was supported within each age
group and confirms our hypothesis of a link between
identifying perpetrators in the lineup situation and source
recollection. Moreover, because older participants scored lower
on our face-source-recollection measure, the data suggest that
age-related deficits in identifying perpetrators may be associ-
ated with age-related deficits in source recollection.
In line with expectations, our measure of general face-
recognition ability (old-minus-nonrepeated-lure discrimination)
showed weaker correlations with lineup performance than did
our source-memory measure. This outcome is both sensible and
theoretically important. It is sensible in terms of the hypothesis
that although lineup performance is based on recollection,
distinguishing old from new faces in standard laboratory tasks
is based partly on differences in familiarity (see Bartlett, Hurry,
& Thorley, 1984). It is theoretically important in ruling out the
simple notion that any two measures of memory for faces are
likely to be correlated. Contrary to that notion, the present
findings suggest that source-memory abilities are specifically
important for good performance with lineups. Further research
is required to examine the relations of source recollection to
lineup performance. One unexpected finding that has to be
addressed is the lack of correlations between source recollec-
tion and performance on those lineups where the target was not
present.
The source-memory component of our face-recognition task
correlated with lineup performance in the TP condition but not
in the TA condition. Perhaps the factors that govern decisions in
TP situations are different from those that govern decisions in
TA situations. Although cognitive factors may be responsible
for decisions in a TP context, social factors (e.g., demand
characteristics) may have a greater effect on decisions in a TA
situation (Memon & Rose, 2002; Pozzulo & Lindsay, 1998).
Despite its limitations, however, the present study is the
first to find direct support for the hypothesis that source recol-
lection is a factor affecting lineup performance. In extending
this hypothesis to a real-world domain, our findings serve to
strengthen its status as a general theory with the power to pre-
dict and explain performance in naturalistic settings. Our find-
ings should also encourage investigators to pursue the applied
implications of the theory to a greater extent than they have
done in the past.
One of the purposes of this study was to determine whether
age differences in lineup performance reflect merely a confound
in prior investigations that have used only young faces as
stimulus materials. On the basis of earlier laboratory studies
(e.g., Fulton & Bartlett, 1991) and one lineup identification
study (Wright & Stroud, 2002), we had predicted that age
differences in lineup performance would be reduced with old
faces as compared with young faces. Our expectations were
confirmed insofar as false identifications are concerned. Al-
though older eyewitnesses made more false identifications than
younger witnesses, this difference was larger with the young
lineup than with the old lineup. Our results therefore differ
from those of prior studies in which Age of Participant 3 Age
of Face interactions were found in hits, but not in false alarms
(Fulton & Bartlett, 1991; Wright & Stroud, 2002). Moreover,
whereas earlier studies found age differences in hits were
reduced with older faces, we noted a trend for age differences in
hits to be larger with the older lineup. The discrepancy with the
findings from Fulton and Bartlett is not surprising in light of the
many methodological differences between the laboratory task
used in that study and the lineup task used in the present
investigation. The discrepancy with the findings of Wright and
Stroud is perhaps more puzzling; but, as noted in the
introduction, their ``older'' witnesses were substantially youn-
ger than ours. In addition, one of the limitations of the typical
lineup study is that only one or two targets are used. Moreover,
in the current study the witnesses were presented with two
highly similar video events and two lineups, all within a short
space of time. More research on this issue is needed that uses
a larger set of faces and different scenarios to see if there are
circumstances in which the other-age effect is more likely to
occur.
Future research should also address an unexpected finding
from our after-lineup questionnaire. Our older participants were
more inclined to suspect the younger perpetrator of a crime than
they were the older perpetrator, whereas there were no age
differences in how the older man was perceived. We plan to
examine the possibility that witnesses' attributions about the
behavior of a perpetrator may be more important than the age of
the perpetrator per se.
