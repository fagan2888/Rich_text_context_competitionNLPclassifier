Reactions of Young Adults to September 11, 2001
Carol A. Ford, MD; J. Richard Udry, PhD; Karin Gleiter, PhD; Kim Chantala, MS
Background: Wave III of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health provides opportunities to de-
scribe the reactions of young adults to September 11, 2001,
and to increase understanding of the reactions among
those who do not directly witness disasters.
Objectives: To compare the feelings, perceptions, and
behaviors of respondents interviewed before with those
of respondents interviewed within 9 weeks after Septem-
ber 11; and to test the influence of time and distance from
terrorist sites on pre-post comparisons.
Design: Cross-sectional study, with comparison groups
before and after September 11.
Setting: In-home interviews.
Participants: Seven thousand ninety-five respondents
aged 18 to 26 years.
Main Outcome Measures: Sadness, psychological dis-
tress, closeness to parents, importance of religion and
spirituality, trust in government, and substance use.
Results: Male (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.33; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.65) and female (aOR, 1.44;
95% CI, 1.22-1.71) respondents interviewed after Sep-
tember 11 were more likely to report sadness and in-
creased trust in government (aOR range, 2.11-3.30) than
those interviewed before September 11. Proportions re-
porting sadness returned to baseline in 4 to 6 weeks; in-
creased political trust persisted for the 9-week study pe-
riod. Male respondents interviewed the second week
afterwards were more likely to report religious faith (aOR,
2.06; 95% CI, 1.40-3.00) and spiritual life (aOR, 1.75;
95% CI, 1.18-2.60) as important than were those inter-
viewed before the event. Female respondents inter-
viewed afterwards were more likely to report higher lev-
els of psychological distress (aOR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.08-
1.83) and closeness to fathers (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI,
1.08-1.72). There were no pre-post differences in sub-
stance use. Respondents closest to terrorist sites were most
affected.
Conclusion: Young adults who did not directly witness
the events of September 11 experienced reactions that
were multifaceted and transient--except for persisting
trust in government.

National response has been
difficult to predict because
most disaster research2-12 focuses on people
who are close to or directly witness disas-
ter events. Some13(pp18-19) would argue that
predictions based on previous research is
not valid because of the unique features of
September 11:
The attack on the World Trade Center killed
American civilians, outside of wartime, and it
killed them on TV, making most of the rest of
usunwillingwitnessestoamassmurder,andthat
places it in a context of its own. We watched the
towers burn and collapse, in real time. And we
watched the bodies drop from the sky--a sight
that most of us will never be able to forget.
Three nationwide surveys14-16 mea-
suring the reactions of adults to Septem-
ber 11 have been published thus far. All
show that adults experienced varying de-
grees of acute stress or posttraumatic stress
symptoms (although the use of different
measures precludes comparisons of re-
sults), and that women were at increased
risk. Responses were influenced by prox-
imity to terrorist sites,14,15 previous men-
tal health,14,16 and age.15,16 One study14 re-
ported that most adults interviewed within
3 to 5 days talked to someone about what
happened and turned to prayer, religion,
or spirituality, while another16 character-
ized psychological coping strategies.
Fortuitously, wave III of The Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health)17 provides an oppor-
tunity to increase our understanding of na-
tional reactions to September 11 among
young adults (those aged 18-26 years).
This is valuable for several reasons. First,
approximately 3000 respondents were in-

terviewed within the 2 months before, and an addi-
tional 4000 were interviewed within the 2 months after,
September 11, providing pre and post comparison data
on a large nationally representative sample--unusual in
disaster research.18 Second, the interview measures cover
a wide range of potential responses to September 11.
Third, reactions of young adults to September 11 are im-
portant because they are in a period of developmental
transition, would likely play a direct role in any military
response, and in one post­September 11 national sur-
vey,15 scored almost 10% higher on a posttraumatic stress
disorder­associated symptom scale than did adults older
than 60 years.
Disaster research perspectives differ by discipline,
and there is no widely accepted theoretical framework.3
Given this context, we use a framework that character-
izes disasters as having the potential for negative and posi-
tive outcomes, and we focus on symptoms and re-
sponses rather than on identifiable disorders. We
hypothesize that young adults interviewed after Septem-
ber 11 will report increased feelings of sadness and psy-
chological distress, lower levels of general health, and re-
duced life expectancy when compared with those
interviewed before September 11. We hypothesize that
young adults interviewed after September 11 will report
increased closeness to parents and mentors, importance
of religion and spirituality, trust in government, blood
donation, contact with friends, and substance use than
those interviewed before September 11. We hypoth-
esize that differences associated with exposure will be in-
fluenced by the passage of time, distance from terrorist
sites, and previous psychiatric illness.
METHODS
All Add Health procedures have been approved by the Univer-
sity of North Carolina School of Public Health Institutional Re-
view Board on Research Involving Human Subjects.
STUDY POPULATION
This analysis uses data collected in wave III of Add Health. The
sampling design for Add Health has been described in detail else-
where.19,20 In brief, it is a panel study of a nationally representa-
tive sample of adolescents who appeared on enrollment rosters
for grades 7 to 12 early in the 1994-1995 school year.
Wave III in-home interviews began on July 21, 2001, and
targeted all wave I respondents living in the continental United
States, Hawaii, and Alaska. The sample for our study was lim-
ited to those aged 18 to 26 years, interviewed between July 21,
2001, and November 12, 2001. We excluded 87 interviews that
occurred at least in part on September 11, 11 that began be-
fore and ended after September 11, and an additional 3 be-
cause the intervals between their beginning and ending dates
were more than 30 days. Our final sample size was 7095 re-
spondents.
INTERVIEW PROCEDURES
After obtaining written consent, interviews lasting approxi-
mately 90 minutes were conducted in homes or other loca-
tions of the respondents' choice using Computer-Assisted Per-
sonal Interview and Computer-Assisted Self-Interview
technologies.21
INDEPENDENT MEASURES
Exposure to September 11
Exposure was measured by the date of the interview.
Sociodemographic Characteristics and Family Structure
Demographic variables included sex, age, and socioeconomic sta-
tus. Respondents were coded as having a low socioeconomic sta-
tus if during the past 12 months they did not have enough money
to pay their full rent or mortgage, gas, electricity, or oil bill; if they
were evicted or lost gas, electric, or oil service because payments
were not made; or if a household member received public assis-
tance or welfare payments before the respondent was 18 years of
age. Race and ethnicity were measured by self-identification and
coded as Latino (if respondents identified themselves to be at least
in part Hispanic or Latino), white, black or African American,
American Indian or Native American, or Asian or Pacific Is-
lander. A modified Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test,22 standard-
ized to scores for those 19 to 24 years of age, measured verbal
ability. Family structure measures included whether respon-
dents were living with a parent or grandparent, living with at least
1 child they considered their own child, and married.
Past Psychiatric Illness
Respondents were coded as having had a past psychiatric ill-
ness if they reported a prior diagnosis of depression, taking pre-
scription medications for depression or stress in the past 12
months, or spending at least 1 day in a facility being treated
for a mental illness in the past 5 years.
Distances From the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
Distances from Manhattan, NY, and from Arlington, Va, were
calculated from latitude and longitude measurements of the ZIP
codes from which respondents were interviewed, adjusting for
the curvature of the earth.23 We also created a variable repre-
senting the shorter of these 2 distances, categorized as within
80 (50), from 81 to 200 (51-125), from 201 to 400 (126-250),
from 401 to 1200 (251-750), and from 1201 to 4000 (751-
2500) km (miles).
DEPENDENT MEASURES
Sadness was measured by the question, "Were you sad during
the past 7 days?" Responses were selected from a 4-point scale
(from never or rarely to most or all of the time). A modified
portion of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression
Scale24 was used to measure feelings and symptoms associated
with psychological distress during the past 7 days (, .80). Gen-
eral health was measured by the question, "In general, how is
your health?" Responses were selected from a 5-point scale (from
excellent to poor). Perception of life expectancy was mea-
sured by the question, "What do you think are the chances that
you will live to age 35?" Five responses were possible (almost
certain, a good chance, a 50-50 chance, some chance but prob-
ably not, and almost no chance).
Perception of closeness to parents was measured by the
question, "How close do you feel to your mother/father?" This
was defined as current or most recent residential mother and
father, with responses selected from a 5-point scale (from ex-
tremely close to not close at all). A similar item measured per-
ception of closeness to an identified living mentor. Respon-
dents rated the importance of their religious faith and spiritual
life on 4-point scales (from not important to more important
than anything else). Respondents' perceptions of angels were

measured by asking how strongly they agreed with the state-
ment, "Angels are present to help or watch over me." Re-
sponses were selected from a 5-point scale (from strongly dis-
agree to strongly agree). Trust in government was measured
by respondents reporting how strongly they agreed with state-
ments of trust in federal, state, and local governments on 5-point
scales (from strongly disagree to strongly agree).
Respondents were asked if they had donated blood, plasma,
or platelets in the past year (yes or no). Contact with friends
was measured by asking the number of times respondents "hung
out" with friends or talked on the telephone for more than 5
minutes in the past 7 days (0-7 times). Respondents who said
they had ever smoked at least 1 cigarette a day for 30 days were
asked if they had smoked in the past 30 days (yes or no); if yes,
they were asked if they smoked every day and asked about their
average number of cigarettes per day. Respondents with his-
tories of smoking marijuana in the past year were asked how
many times they had smoked marijuana in the past 30 days.
Respondents with histories of alcohol use in the past year were
asked the number of times they had had 4 or more drinks in a
row on a single occasion in the past 2 weeks.
ANALYSES
Descriptive frequencies were conducted on unweighted data. All
other analyses were conducted on data weighted to reflect a na-
tionallyrepresentativesampleofyoungadultsaged18to26years.
We constructed sampling weights by adjusting the sum of Wave
I weights for our wave III respondents to match wave I popula-
tion estimates for each age and sex group. We used survey esti-
mation commands in the STATA computer program25 to adjust
for clustering and respondents' unequal probability of selection.
We conducted separate analyses by sex because of known sex dif-
ferences in reactions to stressful events, including September
11,6,7,10,14,16,26 and sex differences demonstrated in our early analy-
ses. We evaluated tests of significance using a Wald statistic for
sets of covariates and t statistics for individual covariates. We did
not impute missing values. To take into account the many analy-
ses conducted, we defined statistical significance as P.01.
Bivariate analyses compared respondents interviewed be-
fore with those interviewed after September 11, looking for sys-
tematic biases linked to date of interview. These were followed
by bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify differences be-
tween respondents interviewed before and after September 11 in
dependent variables. First, analyses compared all respondents in-
terviewed before with all respondents interviewed after Septem-
ber 11. Second, when sample sizes were sufficient, we compared
all respondents interviewed before with those interviewed dur-
ing each week after September 11 to identify differences in de-
pendent variables during shorter intervals. Third, we investi-
gated potential interactions between distance from terrorist sites
andreactionsofrespondents.Becauseinitialanalysesshowedsimi-
lar results for distance to the World Trade Center, the Pentagon,
and the closer of the 2, we used the closer distance in final analy-
ses. Finally, we assessed whether reactions varied by self-
reported history of psychiatric illness. Because of time intervals
specified in measures, tobacco and marijuana analyses excluded
respondents interviewed within 30 days after September 11, and
alcohol analyses excluded respondents interviewed between Sep-
tember 11 and September 25, 2001.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS
Of the 7095 respondents, 2913 were interviewed before
and 4182 were interviewed after September 11. They were
55.8% female, on average 21.7 (SD, 1.68) years of age,
and predominantly white (57.0% white, 20.3% black,
15.5% Latino, and 7.2% Asian). Approximately one quar-
ter (27.1%) were coded as having a low socioeconomic
status. Almost one half (47.6%) were living with a par-
ent or a grandparent, 16.7% were married, and 20.8% were
living with a son or a daughter. Previous psychiatric ill-
ness was reported by 11.8%. A total of 331 respondents
were interviewed within 80 km of the World Trade Cen-
ter or the Pentagon; 223 were interviewed between 81
and 200 km, 432 were interviewed between 201 and 400
km, 2333 were interviewed between 401 and 1200 km,
and 3266 were interviewed between 1201 and 4000 km
of these sites.
Comparisons of those interviewed before with those
interviewed after September 11 showed no significant dif-
ferences in age (P=.54), race or ethnicity (P=.89), ver-
bal ability (P=.89), socioeconomic status (P=.42), mari-
tal status (P=.32), residential children (P=.74), previous
psychiatric illness (P=.98), or distance from terrorist sites
(range, P=.42-.49). Respondents interviewed before Sep-
tember 11 were significantly more likely to live with a
parent or a grandparent than were those interviewed af-
terwards (51.8% vs 42.6%; P.001), and this variable was
controlled in all multivariate analyses.
SADNESS, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, HEALTH,
AND LIFE EXPECTANCY
Young adults experienced sadness and psychological
distress after September 11 (Table). Before September
11, 33.6% of male respondents reported sadness at least
some of the time in the past 7 days, compared with
39.0% after September 11. Among female respondents,
43.8% of those interviewed before September 11
reported sadness, compared with 53.3% interviewed
after September 11. Comparisons of sadness among
respondents interviewed before with those interviewed
in weekly intervals after September 11 showed that the
risk of feeling sad was higher among male respondents
in the 3 weeks immediately after September 11 (ad-
justed odds ratios [aORs], 2.56, 1.66, and 1.57) and
among female respondents interviewed in the first, sec-
ond, and fifth weeks afterwards (aORs, 2.41, 2.50, and
1.48, respectively) (Figure 1). The broader measure of
psychological distress showed a similar pattern for
female respondents. Female respondents interviewed
after September 11 were more likely to score in the
higher ranges of the symptom scale compared with
those interviewed before September 11 (aOR range,
1.33-1.40), particularly in the first, second, fourth, and
fifth weeks (aOR range, 1.77-2.40). There were no dif-
ferences in perception of general health or life expec-
tancy among those interviewed before and after Sep-
tember 11.
PARENTS, RELIGION, SPIRITUALITY,
AND GOVERNMENT
Young adults turned to religion, and even more to the
government, after September 11 (Table). There was a trend
for male respondents interviewed after September 11 to

rank religious faith and spiritual life as more important,
and to be more likely to perceive the presence of angels,
than male respondents interviewed before September 11.
During the second week after September 11, male re-
spondents were significantly more likely to rank their re-
ligious faith (aOR, 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.40-3.00; P.001) and spiritual life (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI,
1.18-2.60; P.01) as very important or more important
than anything else. There were no pre-post changes in
the reported importance of religious faith or spiritual life,
or in the perceived presence of angels, among female re-
spondents in bivariate, multivariate, or weekly interval
analyses.
Male and female respondents interviewed after Sep-
tember 11 were more likely to agree with the following
statements than were respondents interviewed before Sep-
tember 11: "I trust the federal government," "I trust the
state government," and "I trust the local government."
These findings were generally constant for male and fe-
male respondents for 9 weeks after September 11. As-
suming the observed trend persists, we estimate the time
for trust in the federal government to decrease to pre­
September 11 levels would be 70.6 weeks for male re-
spondents and 54.6 weeks for female respondents.
Before September 11, 41.1% of female respon-
dents reported feeling extremely close to their fathers,
compared with 46.2% after September 11 (aOR, 1.36;
95% CI, 1.08-1.72; P.01), although there were no
pre-post differences in perceptions of closeness to
mothers or to mentors. There were no pre-post
changes in males' perceptions of closeness to fathers,
mothers, or mentors.

BLOOD DONATION, FRIENDS,
AND SUBSTANCE USE
Male respondents were more likely to report donating
blood products after September 11 (12.7% before vs 18.7%
after; aOR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.35-2.32]; P.001). There were
no pre-post differences in blood donation among fe-
male respondents. There were no significant pre-post dif-
ferences in contact with friends and in tobacco, mari-
juana, or alcohol use.
INFLUENCE OF DISTANCE
FROM TERRORIST SITES
We found a gradient increase in risk of sadness among
female respondents from west to east, starting at 401 to
1200 km away from terrorist sites, with the greatest pre-
post difference in sadness among female respondents
within 80 km of the sites (odds pre, 0.78; odds post, 2.33;
OR, 2.97 [95% CI, 1.40-6.30]; P.01) (Figure 2).
For other variables, the influences of distance were
most clearly demonstrated when comparing respon-
dents interviewed more than 1200 km away from a ter-
rorist site with those interviewed within 80 km of a ter-
rorist site. There were no pre-post differences in high-
range psychological distress scores among female
respondents more than 1200 km away, but a nearly 4-fold
increase in risk after September 11 among female re-
spondents within 80 km (odds pre, 0.78; odds post, 2.83;
OR, 3.62 [95% CI, 1.94-6.73]; P.001). There were no
pre-post changes in the amount of contact with friends
among female respondents living more than 1200 km
away, whereas female respondents interviewed within 80
km were more likely after than before September 11 to
report hanging out with friends or talking on the tele-
phone (odds pre, 0.39; odds post, 0.95; OR, 2.45 [95%
CI, 1.42-4.24]; P.01).
Distance from terrorist sites influenced one find-
ing among male respondents. There was a greater in-
crease in trust of local government among those within
80 km of terrorist sites. On average, there was a 5% in-
crease in pre-post scores measuring trust in govern-
ment among male respondents living more than 1200
km away from a terrorist site, and a 15% increase in
scores among those living within 80 km of a terrorist
site.
INFLUENCE OF PAST PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS
We found no interaction between self-reported past
psychiatric illness and pre-post differences for all ex-
cept 1 dependent measure. Male respondents with his-
tories of psychiatric illness were more likely to report
increased contact with friends (odds pre, 0.24; odds
post, 0.74; OR, 3.03; P.01), whereas there were no
pre-post changes in contact with friends among male
respondents without psychiatric histories (odds pre,
0.50; odds post, 0.54).
COMMENT
Differences among respondents interviewed before and
after September 11 suggest that young adults were af-
fected by the events that occurred on this date. The pre-
dominant reactions of young adults who did not di-
rectly witness events at the World Trade Center or the
Pentagon were feelings of sadness and psychological dis-
tress, increased importance of religion and spirituality,
and greater trust in all levels of government. Most of these
reactions were transient. The striking exception to this
pattern was persistent trust in government. Our find-
ings are consistent with previous research2 on the men-
tal health impacts of disaster, which suggests that most
exposed to a disaster do well and have only mild transi-
tory symptoms. The meaning of young adults' increased
political trust in the aftermath of September 11, its an-
ticipated duration, and its future implications will likely
be debated among social and political scientists,27-29 and
become an area for ongoing research.
This study highlights the variability in responses to
disaster and the critical importance of distinguishing
between national and local reactions. Consistent with
previous research, we found that young men and
women reacted differently2,6,14-16 and that close proxim-
ity increased the likelihood of being affected.2,6,14,15 Dis-

logical distress, contact with friends, and trust in
government, suggesting that variations in national and
local reactions to disaster involve domains extending
beyond mental health.
We found that young adults with and without pre-
vious psychiatric illness reacted similarly to September
11. Other post­September 11 national surveys14,16 of adults
have found associations between previous mental health
and mental health outcomes. Our negative findings may
be related to use of general emotional outcome mea-
sures instead of traditional diagnosis-oriented measures
(eg, symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress dis-
order), age-cohort differences, or limitations in our mea-
sures for self-reported past psychiatric illness. Given the
prevalence of psychiatric illness in the United States, fur-
ther investigation into the potential negative impact and
clinical implications of even indirect exposure to disas-
ters such as September 11 may be warranted. Other no-
table negative findings included similar use of tobacco,
marijuana, and alcohol among young adults inter-
viewed before and after September 11, which is in con-
trast to the increased substance use reported among young
adults in Manhattan after September 11.9 We did not find
decreased life expectancy, as reported by Halpern-
Felsher and Millstein.30
This was an opportunistic study. The Add Health
data did not include traditional disaster research mea-
sures for acute stress or posttraumatic stress disorder,
limiting our ability to compare results across studies.
Measures for many important reactions are likely absent.
Some measures may not capture important variation,
limiting the validity of our negative findings. We could
not determine whether any of our participants actually
witnessed an event, which may have influenced our
results. The study was cross-sectional; although differ-
ences noted in pre-post comparisons likely reflect reac-
tions to September 11, they do not prove causality.
Finally, we cannot determine how other factors, such as
seasonal variation, emerging news about anthrax, or
military activities, may have contributed to our find-
ings.31
Despite limitations, Add Health provides an
unprecedented description of the reactions of young
adults in the United States to the events of September
11. In the unfortunate circumstance that our nation
faces a similar event in the future, understanding the
reactions of young people who do not directly witness a
disaster may be useful. Based on this study, we would
predict that most will experience transient sadness,
young men will turn to religion in the weeks immedi-
ately following a disaster, and young men and women
will experience increased trust in the government.
Young adults in close proximity to a disaster, particu-
larly young women, seem to be most affected, and they
should be included in research defining the role of post-
disaster interventions.

What This Study Adds
The United States experienced unprecedented events on
September 11. National response has been difficult to pre-
dict because most disaster research focuses on people who
are close to, or directly witness, disaster events. Wave
III of Add Health provides an opportunity to increase our
understanding of national reactions to September 11
among young adults.
After September 11, young adults experienced tran-
sient feelings of sadness, psychological distress, and in-
creased importance of religion and spirituality. They also
experienced increased trust in all levels of government
that persisted for at least 9 weeks. Young adults in close
proximity, particularly young women, seem to be most
affected, and they should be included in research defin-
ing the role of postdisaster interventions.
