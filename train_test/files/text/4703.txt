Introduction
Health Behaviors and the Problem-Behavior
Theory (PBT)
Research on health behaviors and their determinants has
been quite selective in terms of mainly focusing either on
external environmental factors or internal individual deter-
minants of behavior; for instance, while studies have shown
that external influences such as modeling may be very
important in the context of smoking or drinking behavior
(e.g., Sancho, Miguel, & Aldás, 2011; White, Johnson, &
Buyske, 2000), internal determinants such as locus of control
seem to have crucial importance in the context of engage-
ment in physical activity or healthy eating (e.g., Helmer,
Kramer, & Mikolajczyk, 2012). Certainly, the consideration
of personal and environmental variables separately consti-
tutes a major limitation to the proper understanding of the
overall context in which health behaviors are established.
Moreover, research has shown that although separately con-
sidered in studies, both personal and environmental variables
are involved as predictors of health behavior (Cairney, Kwan,
Veldhuizen, & Faulkner, 2014; Silva, Lott, Mota, & Welk,
2014). Another argument along these lines is the repeatedly
found relationship between the several health behaviors
themselves (i.e., individuals engaged in physical activity also
have a healthy diet; conversely, smoking and drinking also
go together); hence, it might be expected that they also have
common personal or environmental predictors (although the
relevance of the specific predictors might vary on the spe-
cific behavior; for example, Kwan, Cairney, Faulkner, &
Pullenayegum, 2012). The identification of common predic-
tors for different health behaviors has an important practical
relevance especially as regards health behavior interven-
tions, that is, they might target simultaneously factors related
to more than one behavior (Hingson, Zha, Iannotti, &
Simons-Morton, 2013).
In this context, the PBT (Jessor, 1991) provides a useful
theoretical framework for understanding health behaviors in

A Predictive Model for Physical Activity,
Healthy Eating, Alcohol Drinking, and
Risky Driving Among Albanian Youth
Erika Melonashi1 and Fleura Shkembi1
Abstract
Studies report an increasing prevalence of health risk behaviors among Albanian adolescents and young adults. The Problem-
Behavior Theory provides a useful framework for explaining both health-compromising and health-enhancing behaviors by
considering several personal and environmental factors. The present study used a model with seven independent variables
including age, gender, attitudes, locus of control, risk behavior tendency, stress, and parent/peer models of health behavior to
predict two health-compromising behaviors (alcohol drinking and risky driving) and two health-enhancing behaviors (physical
activity, healthy eating) in a sample of 347 Albanian young adults (157 men and 190 women, M
age
= 20.42, SD = 1.48). The
measuring instrument was based on the Health Behavior Questionnaire developed by Jessor, Donovan, and Costa. Results
showed that the model explained 26.1% of the variance in risky driving behavior, and the significant predictors included,
risk behavior tendency, gender, and attitude toward health. These same three variables also significantly predicted drinking
behavior, explaining 16.8% of the variance. Also the model explained 14.2% of the variance in healthy eating behavior and the
significant predictors included, models of significant others, gender, locus of control, attitude toward health, and age. Finally,
the only two significant predictors for physical activity were risky behavior tendency and perceived stress, which accounted
for 13.2% of the variance. Findings are discussed in the context of suggestions for future research and practical implications
for policy making.

terms of interplays between personal and environmental fac-
tors. Although PBT was not originally a health-behavior
theory, it has proved to be quite successful in explaining a
wide range of health risk behaviors among adolescents and
young adults, both cross-culturally and longitudinally
(Jessor, 2008; Jessor, Donovan, & Costa, 1991; Jessor &
Turbin, 2014). More specifically, the theory considers the
interactions of three main systems of variables including (a)
perceived environmental variables, (b) personality system
variables, and (c) behavior system variables. Variables in the
environment or personality systems might serve both as con-
trols or instigators of the specific health behavior (Jessor,
Turbin, & Costa, 1998). Studies have indicated that the the-
ory is useful in explaining both health-compromising (e.g.,
drinking) and health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., physical
activity, healthy eating; Jessor, Turbin, & Costa, 2010).
PBT Components: Perceived Environmental
Variables
The perceived environmental variables comprise two main cat-
egories: proximal variables (i.e., variables whose link to the
specific behavior is direct) and distal variables (i.e., variables
whose link to the specific behavior is not direct but requires
theoretical explanations; Jessor et al., 1998). Behavioral mod-
els have been considered among the most influential proximal
environmental variables; thus, parents' or friends' behavior
might promote health-compromising/enhancing behaviors
accordingly. Examples might include, alcohol drinking among
individuals who have drinking parents or healthy eating among
individuals growing up in families with healthy eating habits.
On the other hand, models might also inhibit both types of
behavior, for example, abstaining from alcohol drinking among
individuals whose friends/peer groups do not drink, or having
unhealthy eating habits among individuals whose friends/peers
eat junk food. Research studies have supported the relevance of
family models in the establishment of drinking patterns or eat-
ing habits (Birch & Fisher, 1998; Nansel et al., 2013; Nicklas et
al., 2001; Schmidt, Morrongiello, & Colwell, 2014; White et
al., 2000). Peers also serve as important models influencing
health behaviors such as alcohol consumption or physical
activity (Sancho et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2014).
Stress, on the other hand, represents an important though
distal environmental variable. The relationships between
stress levels and health-compromising behaviors are by now
widely accepted. More specifically, research has indicated
that higher levels of perceived stress are related with
increased alcohol drinking, overeating/less healthy eating,
and reduced physical activity (Jääskeläinen et al., 2014;
Stults-Kolehmainen & Sinha, 2014). Findings have been
explained in terms of stress management efforts, for exam-
ple, drinking or overeating to reduce anxiety levels, negative
feelings, and so on (e.g., Park & Iacocca, 2014; Read,
Radomski, & Borsari, 2015) or negative stress outcomes
(e.g., poor motivation and low energy to engage in physical
activity; Gerber, Jonsdottir, Lindwall, & Ahlborg, 2014).
PBT Components: Personality System Variables
Personality system variables include a set of variables both
social and cognitive in nature, such as attitudes, general ori-
entations toward the self or society, and so on (Jessor et al.,
2010). Relationships between attitudes and behavior have
been thoroughly investigated by now (e.g.,Ajzen & Fishbein,
1977), although controversy still exists on their relevance of
attitudes in the context of other predictors of behavior. As
regards the impact of personal risk-taking tendencies on
actual behavior, several controversial findings have been
reported, for example, either supporting or discarding its rel-
evance (Appelt, Milch, Handgraaf, & Weber, 2011; Lauriola,
Panno, Levin, & Lejuez, 2014). Thus, the debate over the
respective influence of this variable in the context of other
determinants of behavior is ongoing, as research is focusing
more and more on the conditions under which one compo-
nent or the other acquires greater importance (e.g., Kopetz et
al., 2014). In this context, the increased specificity in defin-
ing risk behavior tendency (i.e., in terms of the specific
behavior investigated such as unprotected sex, risky driving,
etc.), increases the relevance of this variable as a predictor of
health behavior (e.g., Shuper, Joharchi, & Rehm, 2014).
Research has provided evidence indicating relationships
between variables such as risk motivation and risky driving
behavior, sensation seeking and drinking behavior, and so on
(Aklin, Luejez, Zvolensky, Kahler, & Gwadz, 2005; Romer,
2010; Wilkinson, Shete, Spitz, & Swann, 2011). Thus, risk
orientation seems to be an instigator of health-compromising
behaviors such as drinking or risky driving, although its rel-
evance depends also on the other factors investigated. Also,
the relationship might not be very straightforward when it
comes to health-enhancing behaviors such as physical activ-
ity or healthy eating.
Indeed health-enhancing behaviors seem to be better
explained in terms of another personality variable, that is,
locus of control. Research has supported the relevance of
locus of control in explaining health-related behaviors;
thus, individuals who believe that they are in control of
their behavior and feel responsible for their own state of
health (internal locus of control) are engaged in more
healthy behaviors than those who think they are not respon-
sible for their health (Helmer et al., 2012; Song & Ling,
2011; Vakeflliu, Argjiri, Peposhi, Sejdini, & Melani, 2002).
Thus, internal health locus of control seems to be an insti-
gator of healthy eating behavior, and physical activity,
while serving as control for alcohol drinking or risky driv-
ing behavior.
The Context and Purpose of the Study
The present study uses a theoretically driven predictive
model with the purpose of explaining two health-compro-
mising behaviors, alcohol drinking and risky driving, and
two health-enhancing behaviors: healthy eating and physical
activity in a cross-sectional sample ofAlbanian young adults.
As compared with other European countries, Albania has a
Melonashi and Shkembi 3
very young population (by 2010, youth up to 18 years old
comprised almost 40% of the whole population; Albania
Economy Statistic Facts, 2010; World Bank Report, 2006).
As research studies indicate, adolescence and young adult-
hood represent a critical period for the establishment of
health behaviors, as individuals move further away from
parental control and acquire greater independence in choos-
ing their lifestyles (e.g., kinds of foods they eat, how much
they drink, physical activities they are involved, and so on;
Eaton et al., 2012; Jessor et al., 1991; Marquis, 2005;
Walther, Aldrian, Stüger, Kiefer, & Ekmekcioglu, 2014). In
the specific Albanian social context, changes in the politi-
cal regime (from communism to democracy) have been
accompanied with increasing rates of smoking, alcohol and
drug use, malnutrition, and unsafe sexual practices as com-
pared with rates in the 1990s (Hajdini, 2009). Moreover,
there is a fast increase in the number of traffic accidents in
general and fatal accidents in particular among adolescents
and young adults; alcohol use has been identified as one of
the strongest predictors of this outcome (together with
younger age; Qirjako, Burazeri, Hysa, & Roshi, 2008).
Most concerning, the long-term negative effects of increas-
ing health risk behaviors are already becoming evident.
According to the Albanian Public Health Institute, there is
an alarming increase in the prevalence of lifestyle diseases
such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, and so on
(Family Health International, 2006; Public Health Institute,
2013). In this context, it has been argued that the ongoing
reform of the health care system in Albania must place
greater focus on prevention (involving the identification
and control of risk factors) in addition to patient care
(Dumi & Sinaj, 2014). Hence, factors related to or
explaining health behaviors need to be identified and
addressed properly.
In this context, the present study aimed to examine the
impact of (a) perceived environmental variables: models of
parents/friends and perceived levels of stress; (b) personality
variables: attitude toward health, (internal) health locus of
control, and risk orientation on two health-compromising
behaviors: alcohol drinking and risky driving, and two
health-enhancing behaviors: healthy eating and physical
activity. Age and gender patterns for all four behaviors were
also examined.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants were 347 students of the European University of
Tirana, 157 (45%) men and 190 (55%) women, aged between
18 and 22 years old (M
age
= 20.42, SD = 1.48). For the pur-
pose of the study, stratified sampling was used, so that the
sample reflects the real proportions of first-, second-, and
third-level students studying in the three faculties of the
university (Economics, Law, and Social Sciences). Table 1
shows the classification of participants by faculty and level
of study.
The study procedure extended over 10 days and was
guided by a previously designed scheme taking into account
the schedule of classes for each faculty and each level. In
collaboration with the university professors, project collabo-
rators entered the classrooms during the last 15 min and dis-
tributed the questionnaires together with the informed
consent forms. Students were assured of the anonymity and
confidentiality of the data and were free to withdraw from
the study at any time.
Measuring Instruments
The measuring instrument was based on the Health Behavior
Questionnaire developed by Jessor et al. (1991). Relevant
permission was acquired by authors. For the purpose of the
study, only parts of the instrument measuring the variables of
interest were used. The translation and back-translation
method was used to ensure the correct translation of the
selected items. Hence, the items were translated intoAlbanian
by two professional translators and subsequently the two
versions were back-translated into English by two other pro-
fessional translators. English versions were compared against
each other and the original. Inconsistencies were noted down
and addressed in the respective Albanian versions. Both
Albanian versions were piloted among 10 students. The
respective scores correlated highly (r = .85) and students did
not report any difficulties with the items. A subsequent dis-
cussion with students (focus group) was conducted to resolve
the differences in wording between the two versions of the
questionnaire (e.g., which version was most clear according
to them?) and come up with one final version.
The first part of the questionnaire provided information
on participants' age, gender, as well as level and program of
study. Healthy eating was measured with four items, with
higher scores showing more frequent healthy eating behav-
ior. Examples included, "How often do you eat vegetables/
fruit?" The subscale showed good internal consistency ( =
.83). Driving behavior was also assessed with four items,
with higher scores showing more frequent risky driving.
Examples included, "During the last 6 months, how often did
you drive after having one or two drinks?" This subscale also

had acceptable internal consistency ( = .77). Drinking
behavior was measured with a single item assessing fre-
quency of getting drunk in the past 6 months, with higher
scores showing a higher frequency. Physical activity was
also measured with a single item assessing the amount of
time spent with different physical activities per week; higher
scores indicated more time spent with physical activities.
Attitude toward health/value placed on health was mea-
sured with seven items, with higher scores indicating more
importance placed on health. Examples included, "How
important is it for you to feel in good shape?" The subscale
had acceptable internal consistency,  = .79. Health locus of
control was assessed with four items, with higher scores
indicating stronger internal locus of control. Examples
included, "If I do things right, it's easy to stay in good
health." The subscale had acceptable internal consistency, 
= .70. Risk behavior tendency was measured with four items,
with higher scores indicating a stronger tendency toward
risk-taking behavior. Examples included, "In the past 6
months, how often have you done something dangerous just
for the thrill of it?" "In the past 6 months, how often have
you taken chances with your safety when you were out at
night because it was exciting?" This subscale also had
acceptable internal consistency,  = .78.
Models of behavior were assessed with eight items group-
ing together parent/peer models of the four behaviors of
interest; the scores on the two health-compromising behav-
iors (drinking/risky driving) were reversed, so that higher
scores on the subscale ultimately indicated more healthy
models of behavior. Examples included, "Does your mother/
father/closest friend pay attention to eating a healthy diet?"
The subscale had acceptable internal consistency,  = .73.
Finally, perceptions of stress were measured with three items
assessing reported stress in different settings. Examples
included, "In the past 6 months, how much stress or pressure
have you felt at home?" Higher scores indicated higher stress
levels and the subscale had low but acceptable internal con-
sistency,  = .69.
Analyses and Results
Descriptive Analyses
Descriptive analyses indicated that 41.3% of the sample
reported they never got drunk in the past 6 months, 50.6%
reported this behavior as occurring rarely to sometimes, and
8% reported getting drunk often. In terms of risky driving
behavior, 27.6% of the sample reported they never engaged
in risky driving behavior in the past 6 months, whereas the
remaining 72.4% reported at least one form of risky driving
behavior during this time period. In terms of physical activ-
ity, only 24.5% of the sample reported not being engaged in
any form of physical activity on a weekly basis. As regards
healthy eating behavior, only 1.8% of the sample reported
total lack of any healthy eating habits; the rest of the sample
reported at least one healthy eating habit (e.g., eating fruits
and vegetables), and 26.4% of the sample reported all four
listed habits. Descriptive statistics on attitude/value placed
on health indicated that only 75.6% of participants consid-
ered feeling healthy as "important" or "very important,"
whereas the remaining 24.4% as little or somewhat
important.
Multivariate Regression Analysis
Correlations between the dependent variables indicated that
healthy eating correlated positively with physical activity, r
= .16, p < .01, so that individuals following a healthy diet
also tended to do more physical activity. Drinking behavior
correlated positively with risky driving behavior, r = .48, p <
.01, so that individuals who reported getting drunk more fre-
quently also reported more risky driving behavior.
Considering the multiple dependent variables, which also
correlated with each other, multivariate regression was per-
formed with healthy eating, drinking behavior, physical
activity, and driving behavior as dependent variables, and
gender, age, attitudes, locus of control, risk behavior ten-
dency, models of behavior, and stress perceptions as inde-
pendent variables. Results showed that the proposed model
was better at predicting driving behavior, R2 = .261, followed
by drinking behavior, R2 = .168, healthy eating, R2 = .142,
and physical activity, R2 = .132. Table 2 indicates only the
results that showed statistical significance.
The only significant predictors of risky driving behavior
in order of importance were risk behavior tendency, gender,
and attitude toward health (see Table 2). These same three
variables also significantly predicted drinking behavior (the
only difference was that gender ranked third in order of
importance). Hence, youth who reported more frequent
drinking and risky driving behaviors in the past 6 months,
also reported a stronger risk behavior tendency, put less
value on health, and were more likely to be men.
The strongest predictor of healthy eating was "models of
significant others," followed by gender, locus of control, atti-
tude toward health, and age (see Table 2). Hence, youth who
reported healthier eating habits, also reported healthier
behavior models (parents and friends); also they were more
likely to be women, had stronger internal locus of control,
put more value on health, and were older in age. Finally, the
only two significant predictors for physical activity were
risky behavior tendency and perceived stress (see Table 2).
Thus, youth who engaged more in physical activity reported
a stronger tendency toward risk behavior, and also lower lev-
els of stress.

Discussion
The present study used a theoretical driven model to predict
two health-compromising (alcohol drinking, risky driving)
and two health-enhancing (healthy eating, physical activity)
behaviors in a sample of Albanian youth. Results indicated
that the majority of participants reported healthy eating hab-
its, engaged in physical activities, and also reported never or
rarely getting drunk. However, as regards risky driving
behavior, about 70% of current drivers reported at least one
form of risky driving during the last 6 months (speeding up/
not wearing seatbelts/crossing with red light, etc.). These
results are particularly concerning considering the increasing
rates of accident-related deaths in Albania (e.g., Qirjako et
al., 2008) and should be also further investigated in future
research. Factors, which might promote this massive non-
compliance with driving regulations in Albania, should be of
major concern. Although this aspect was beyond the scope of
the present study, findings provided some explanation of
risky driving at least in terms of individual-level factors;
indeed, the suggested model proved to be mostly useful in
explaining risky driving behavior (as compared with the
other three behaviors of interest).
Risky Driving and Drinking Behavior
Both risky driving and drinking behavior were explicable in
terms of risk behavior tendency, gender, and attitude toward
health. The relevance of these three individual difference
variables raises once more the debate of internal versus
external determinants of behavior. These findings are in line
with existing research finding associations between health
behaviors and risk orientation (Aklin et al., 2005; Romer,
2010; Wilkinson et al., 2011). Thus, risk behavior tendency
in this case serves as a promoter for both health-compromis-
ing behaviors investigated in the study. Male gender is also
an important predictor for both health-compromising behav-
iors, a finding which is in line with current cross-cultural
research (Khan, Cleland, Scheidell, & Berger, 2014; Özkan
&Lajunen,2005;Rhodes&Pivik,2011;Wilsnack,Vogeltanz,
Wilsnack, & Harris, 2000). Conversely, female gender not
only serves as a control of health-compromising behaviors
but also as an instigator of healthy behavior (e.g., eating hab-
its). These findings are in line with existing research and
have been explained in terms of weight control and body
image concerns (Leblanc, Bégin, Corneau, Dodin, &
Lemieux, 2015).
Healthy Eating Behavior
Apart from gender, attitude toward health (value placed on
health) also was relevant in explaining not only the two
health-compromising behaviors but also healthy eating
behavior. Thus, the value individuals place on health seems
to act as a control in the cases of risky driving or drinking
behavior, but as an instigator in the case of a health promot-
ing behavior such as healthy eating. Hence, despite the lack
of specificity (e.g., Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977), this variable
seems to be important across a range of different health
behaviors, a finding which has implications especially in
terms of prevention/intervention programs addressing atti-
tudes to health. Indeed, in the present sample, almost one
fourth of participants considered health to be little or some-
what important and this figure might be much higher in other
parts of the population (e.g., in youth who do not have uni-
versity education). This finding is important considering that
Albania is still a country where regular check-ups are still a
behavior of the minority, where self-medication is the most
frequent form of self-reliance, and professional assessment is
limited only to urgent or grave cases (De Soto, Gordon,
Gedeshi, & Sinoimeri, 2002).

6 SAGE Open
Apart from gender and attitude, healthy eating behavior
was also predicted from behavioral models, locus of control,
and age. These findings are in line with research suggesting
the importance of family models in the acquisition of healthy
behavior (e.g., Nansel et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2014; Silva
et al., 2014) and the relevance of internal locus of control in
health behavior maintenance (e.g., Helmer et al., 2012; Song
& Ling, 2011; Vakeflliu et al., 2002). In addition, increasing
age has also been associated with more healthy eating habits;
it has been suggested that increasing age provides the neces-
sary knowledge and control to adopt a healthier lifestyle
(e.g., Sijtsma et al., 2012).
Physical Activity
Finally, physical activity was significantly predicted by only
two variables, risk behavior tendency and perceived stress.
The positive association between risk behavior tendency and
physical exercise is a quite controversial finding which needs
to be addressed in future research. A possible explanation is
that engagement in physical exercise might provide a
"healthy" way to manage the individual tendency toward
risk taking. However, this proposition cannot be tested in the
present research because the study did not assess motives for
exercising or the types of physical activities individuals were
engaged in (e.g., extreme sports?). On the other hand, the
negative relationship between physical activity and levels of
stress replicates research suggesting the stress management
function of physical activity (e.g., Cairney et al., 2014).
Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research
To summarize, findings indicated that the model did best in
explaining health-compromising rather than health-enhanc-
ing behaviors. Moreover personal, rather than environmental
variables proved to be more relevant in predicting all four
health behaviors. Despite its' contribution in suggesting
some of the determinants of health behaviors in the Albanian
context, the study also has some limitations which need to be
discussed and addressed in future research. For instance, the
broad scope of the present study (four different health behav-
iors) makes it quite difficult to discuss or analyze in depth the
particularity of each health behavior. Future research might
consider apart from macro-level variables, also behavior-
specific variables (e.g., attitude toward drinking, rather than
just attitude toward health in general). Along these lines,
there are also several methodological shortcomings which
need to be acknowledged. First, considering that the sample
included students from only one Albanian university, care
should be taken in generalizing the findings for the student
population in Albania. Moreover, Albanian youth who did
not pursue university studies might provide a quite different
picture from the one discussed in the present research. Hence,
it is suggested that future research should be conducted with
more representative samples, where education might also be
considered as a variable. Another limitation has to do with
the measure used; it is suggested that future research uses
more specific behavioral measures, and avoids single item
measures. Nonetheless, despite its limitations, findings of the
present study provide useful directions for future research in
the area; for instance, a particularly interesting and important
problem to address might involve factors explaining the high
noncompliance rates with traffic regulations, including coun-
try-specific policies, or attitudes toward these policies.
Moreover, the controversial findings concerning the relation-
ship between physical activity and risky behavior tendency
also need further research; thus, it might be quite interesting
to explore the actual function of physical activity in individu-
als prone to engage in risky behavior. Finally, issues related
to gender roles, cultural norms, and health risk behaviors
might also represent a fruitful direction for future research in
Albania.
