Comprehensive Intervention Programs
(CIPs) for College Access
Calls, claims, and findings from political leaders (e.g.,
Obama, 2012), policy organizations (e.g., Carnevale, Smith,
& Strohl, 2010), and research (e.g., Giegerich, 2006) address
the need to increase enrollment in higher education institu-
tions. Of particular focus is the attention to student popula-
tions traditionally underserved by higher education (e.g.,
students who are first in their family to attend college, aca-
demically underprepared, ethnic minority, or from low socio-
economic backgrounds). Efforts to increase the college going
rate of these students include financial aid (e.g., grants, loans,
and work study), college awareness and preparation pro-
grams, and attention to factors such as expectations and aspi-
rations; academic ability and preparation; accurate
information about college options; and support from teach-
ers, counselors, family members, and peers. Early interven-
tion or outreach efforts focus on eliminating higher education
barriers to ensure that academically qualified individuals are
not denied access. CIP is a term that was first used by Cabrera
et al. (2006) to describe a comprehensive approach in pro-
viding resources for underserved students to help them pre-
pare for higher education. Cabrera studied the specific CIP,
Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate
Programs (GEAR UP), although the term CIP may be applied
to programs such as Achievement Via Individual
Determination (AVID); I Have a Dream (IHAD);
Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA);
and the initial three TRiO programs, now nine, suite of pro-
grams through the Federal Government. CIP initiatives are
established by not-for-profit and governmental organizations
to increase the likelihood that underserved students will suc-
cessfully make the transition from high school to college.
Several researchers have investigated specific compo-
nents within CIPs (Adelman, 1999, 2006; Cabrera & La
Nasa, 2001; Paulsen & St. John, 2002), and others have stud-
ied additional components for possible inclusion (Fenske,
Ceranios, Keller, & Moore, 1997; King, 2012; Perna, 2002;
Tierney, Corwin, & Colyar, 2005; Tierney & Hagedorn,
2002). Gardner (2009) synthesized the CIP literature and
empirically identified 19 CIP components that help under-
served students prepare for college, one of which was parent
involvement. CIP components such as parent involvement
"provide access to forms of cultural and social capital that
are usually unavailable to low-income students" (Cabrera

Does the Sustainability of Comprehensive
Intervention Programs Depend on Parent
Involvement?
Douglas S. Gardner1 and Jacob M. Marszalek2
Abstract
In this research, the importance and sustainability of one of the components of Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness
for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), parent involvement, was studied identifying the importance placed on parent
involvement determined the programs' capacity for sustainability. Results show parent involvement activities, which may
provide the most beneficial outcome for parents and their children, are activities that include parents in the planning, decision
making, and recruitment of other parents, and that parents need to be considered an important part of GEAR UP services
from the beginning of program development. The importance placed on parent involvement was found to have a strong
positive effect on the capacity for sustainability of partnership type programs, which draws attention to the way partnership
programs are created, and programs that best meet the needs of the community are created by those in the community in
which services are provided.

2 SAGE Open
et al., 2006, p. 94). The provision of access to cultural and
social capital for students and their families is vital for under-
served students to access higher education. Parents play a
prominent role in helping their children gain access to and
succeed in higher education, so that they may accomplish
their educational goals.
Parent involvement is possibly the most beneficial
resource for children in the classroom (Perna & Titus, 2005).
However, parent involvement as a CIP component lacks
empirical support. Personnel who manage parent involve-
ment components frequently become frustrated because of
the lack of participation by parents, but within the GEAR UP
intervention program, the issue is compounded: Parent
involvement and all other components are expected to con-
tinue beyond the time period of the grant, and the sustain-
ability of parent involvement is unknown (Department of
Education [ED], 2003). The theoretical framework for the
sustainability component of our study came from the public
health and health promotion literatures regarding empirical
and theoretical evidence for the sustainability capacity of
innovations (e.g., Goodman & Steckler, 1989; Johnson,
Hays, Center, & Daley, 2004; Mancini & Marek, 2004;
Scheirer, Hartling, & Hagerman, 2008; Shediac-Rizkallah &
Bone, 1998).
Parent Involvement: The Problem and
Potential
Parent involvement activities constitute college readiness
activities involving parents, and may include the participa-
tion of parents in their children's education at any level, as
well as a variety of partnerships between the school, family,
and community (Auerbach, 2012a; Hill & Taylor, 2004;
Perna, 2006). In the context of our study, parent involvement
is the inclusion of parents and family members in their chil-
dren's education, ultimately leading to college attendance
(Perna & Titus, 2005). Recent studies have shown parent
involvement is positively related to aspirations for attending
college, as well as actual enrollment and academic perfor-
mance leading to college success (Rowan-Kenyon, Bell, &
Perna, 2008). Research also demonstrates parents from low-
income backgrounds face economic, social, and psychologi-
cal barriers (Hoover-Dempsey & Sandler, 1997;
Rowan-Kenyon et al., 2008).
Within CIP programs focused specifically on preparing
students from low socioeconomic backgrounds for college--
despite recognition of parent involvement as important--
program personnel have doubts about involving parents,
citing parent involvement as the most difficult component to
implement (Auerbach 2001, 2004; King, 2012; Perna &
Titus, 2005; Swail & Perna, 2000; Tierney, 2002; Tierney &
Auerbach, 2005). In their review of the literature, Tierney
and Auerbach (2005) concluded parent involvement is unde-
rutilized because CIPs are underfunded, noting when priori-
tization of services takes place, components such as parent
involvement "almost never rise to the top" (p. 45). Perna
(2002) found parent involvement was the most challenging
component for CIPs to develop and implement. Both Gandara
and Bial's (2001) evaluation of several CIPs, and the ED
(2003) evaluation of GEAR UP, showed personnel frequently
became frustrated with the lack of parent participation, which
limited the implementation of parent involvement. Programs
involving parents were especially limited for students from
underserved populations (Gandara & Bial, 2001), the very
focus of those same programs.
Rowan-Kenyon et al. (2008) observed past research has
focused on the quantity of parent involvement rather than the
quality, and concluded program personnel had a clear idea
about how to involve parents in preparing their children for
college (e.g., attendance at school or program sponsored
events), but parents did not meet these expectations because
of "work commitments, lack of comfort with school staff,
language barriers, and conditional mistrust" (p. 583). Rowan-
Kenyon et al. (2008) recommended school and program per-
sonnel give up on their preconceptions about parents, and
instead find innovative ways to involve parents. Perna (2002)
reported the most problematic concern for CIPs was coordi-
nating with parents. In Perna's study, about 25% of all pro-
grams required a parent involvement component, and
approximately 75% had some form of one. The GEAR UP
evaluation conducted by the ED (2003) found that "with
some notable exceptions, the projects [were] experiencing
difficulty engaging parents in activities" (p. 13). The evalua-
tors found that project staff members and teachers at project
schools became frustrated with the lack of parent responsive-
ness, and attributed poor attendance by parents to a lack of
concern by the parents for their children's educations.
However, they also found parents viewed themselves as
involved with and concerned about their children's
education.
Parents can have the most significant influence on student
preparation for and success in college, regardless of the fam-
ily's income level, ethnicity, or the amount of education the
parentsmayhavereceived(Hossler,Braxton,&Coopersmith,
1989; Hossler & Gallagher, 1987; Hossler, Schmit, & Vesper,
1999; Hossler & Stage, 1992; King, 2012; Perna & Titus,
2005; Rowan-Kenyon et al., 2008). Perna and Titus (2005)
concluded that "parent involvement as a form of social capi-
tal . . . [was] positively related to college enrollment regard-
less of the level of individual and school resources" (p. 511).
Parent influence was identified as particularly influential for
underserved populations, such as Hispanics and African
Americans. Perna and Titus pointed out "college preparation
programs, particularly those that are able to effectively
involve parents, offer a promising approach" (p. 511) in
addressing the needs of underserved groups.
A crucial characteristic of parent involvement is its inter-
face with all other CIP components as parents occupy a spe-
cial position in the student's life to help the child take
advantage of other services provided by a CIP. Parents are
recognized as an important factor in college enrollment from
the time students enter preschool to the completion of
Gardner and Marszalek 3
secondary education and the transition to college (Cabrera &
La Nasa, 2001), as well as throughout their college pursuits
(Wartman & Savage, 2008). Jun and Colyar (2002) reviewed
the K-12 literature regarding parent involvement and con-
cluded as follows: "A majority of the research indicated that
students performed better and had higher levels of motiva-
tion when they were raised in homes characterized by sup-
portive parents who were involved in schools and who
encouraged and expected academic success" (p. 195).
Parental influence across the socioeconomic spectrum is sig-
nificant. As Rowan-Kenyon et al. (2008) concluded, policies
and programs can in fact shape the educational futures of
children from an early age for both low and high socioeco-
nomic families.
Parent Involvement in Preparing for
College
A role for parents in the college selection process is articu-
lated in the college choice literature (Hossler et al., 1989;
Hossler & Gallagher, 1987; Hossler et al., 1999; Hossler &
Stage, 1992; Paulsen, 1990; Perna, 2006). Hossler et al.
(1989), in an article considered central to understanding col-
lege choice (Cabrera & La Nasa, 2000; Griffin, del Pilar,
McIntosh, & Griffin, 2012; Perna, 2002, 2006), suggested a
three-stage model consisting of (a) predispositions, (b)
search, and (c) choice. Hossler et al. (1999) identified five
key factors in the predisposition stage that involve the fam-
ily: (a) socioeconomic, (b) parent education level, (c) family
residence characteristics, (d) parent support, and (e) parent
encouragement. According to Hossler et al. (1999), parent
support and encouragement--in the form of "frequency of
discussions between parents and students about the parents'
expectations, hopes, and dreams for their children" to attend
college (p. 24)--have the most influence on students attend-
ing college. In their longitudinal study, Hossler et al. (1999)
interviewed 4,923 students and their parents--with a smaller
subsample of students interviewed at least eight times as they
made their way to higher education or the workforce--and
found "parents, other family members, and to a lesser extent,
peers had the largest effect on students' college aspirations"
(p. 23). They also found students who talked with their par-
ents about their postsecondary plans were more likely plan-
ning to attend college, and were more likely certain of their
plans, than students who did not talk to their parents. Parent
encouragement and support were identified as important pre-
dictors of educational aspirations for students from under-
served populations.
Perna (2006) developed a well-received model that
describes the basis for considering the role of the school,
community, and parents each influencing students in their
transition to college. Perna's model was built on the work of
Hossler and Gallagher (1987) and Paulsen (1990), and
framed the college decision-making process in a multi-
layered context: (a) students and their families, (b) K-12
schools and community, (c) higher education institutions, (d)
and the broader societal, economic, and policy context. The
most important student level predictors for college enroll-
ment identified by Perna were (a) academic preparation and
achievement, (b) financial resources, (c) knowledge about
college, and (d) family support. This model took into account
the economic or human capital factors, as well as the cultural
and sociological factors (Bourdieu & Passerson, 1977;
Coleman, 1988), in explaining the way social structures and
resources provide or limit access to higher education
(McDonough, 1997). Rowan-Kenyon et al. (2008) indicated
most relevant research regarding college access focuses on
the "innermost layer of the model: the relationship between a
student's parental encouragement and involvement and the
student's college-related outcomes" (p. 566). However, the
other layers, especially the second layer (Schools and
Community Context), focused attention on the need for the
school and community to "provide access to resources and
opportunities including information about college and help
with college admission requirements" (Perna, 2006, p. 118).
Parents, Schools, and Community
As stated in the findings and conclusion sections of the pres-
ent article, the importance placed on parent involvement had
apositiveinteractionwithpartnershiptypegrants.Partnership
grants, consisting of a partnership with school and commu-
nity organizations, may facilitate the development of parent
involvement activities and break down the barriers created
between the parents and school. For many educators, the
involvement of parents is an affront to their credibility, and
though they may know the involvement of parents is impor-
tant, they resist it. The conflict between the school and fam-
ily is not new: Lightfoot (1978) described the conflict as two
silos: parents and teachers, both curious about each other, yet
they create roadblocks for the other, even excluding one
another from having a positive influence.
In an attempt to assuage the sometimes contentious rela-
tionship between the home and the school, Epstein (1995;
see also Epstein & Jansorm, 2004; Epstein & Lee, 1995)
developed one of the more commonly used frameworks for
describing and measuring parent involvement in the K-12
setting. This metric identified six types of parent involve-
ment in which schools should encourage parents to engage as
they seek to influence their children's education. First,
schools should promote parenting as the most basic form of
parent involvement by providing resources for parents to
learn good parenting skills, provide family support, under-
stand child and adolescent development, and create a good
learning environment in the home. Second, schools should
communicate with families about school programs in a recip-
rocal relationship. Third, schools should participate in
recruitment, training, and other activities that include parents
as volunteers in the school. Fourth, schools should promote
learning at home where teachers create homework assign-
ments requiring students to ask for help from parents, and
encouraging students to share what they learned in school
4 SAGE Open
with their families. Fifth, schools should include parents as
partners in decision making, such as participation on school
councils, improvement teams, committees, parent and
teacher groups, or other organizations where parent input is
valued. Sixth, schools should coordinate resources and ser-
vices for families to engage with community organizations,
such as businesses, agencies, civic organizations, or colleges
and universities helping families contribute their resources to
the community.
In a qualitative case study of parent involvement within
CIP programs seeking to expand access to higher education
for underserved populations, Auerbach (2001; see also
Auerbach, 2004; Tierney & Auerbach, 2005) criticized
Epstein's (1995) framework for its singular focus on school-
based activities that include parents, and for the exclusion of
parent involvement activities considering the unique needs
of low-income and minority families. Low-income and
minority families are unlikely participants in activities
directed by the school (Tierney &Auerbach, 2005).Auerbach
suggested a role for parents advocating for their children's
rights, such as protecting children from discrimination,
obtaining special services, resisting tracking, choosing
schools, promoting family values, or establishing social net-
works with other families. Auerbach's conceptualization aids
in helping to conceive of a type of parent involvement that is
not just a top-down approach originating at the school, where
school personnel are viewed as sages with the solutions and
parents are expected to listen and respond. Auerbach chal-
lenged educators to see parent involvement as involving par-
ents in making decisions and solving problems that confront
their children and the school system, and not just showing up
to school-planned activities. A less criticized concept intro-
duced by Epstein (1995; see also Epstein & Jansorm, 2004;
Epstein & Lee, 1995) is making schools more home-like and
homes more school-like. In family-like schools, all students,
regardless of the challenges they bring, feel valued and
included as members of the education community. In school-
like families, students are recognized as students, and the
importance of doing homework and other activities that build
student skills is emphasized. Communities can create school-
like opportunities for students that reinforce student learning
and create family-like settings that support families and chil-
dren. Epstein explained that in a true partnership, the school,
family, and community work together to identify and fill
gaps where learning resources for students are lacking. In a
partnership, gaps in community resources are filled by fam-
ily and school resources, and when the family or the school
falls short, community partners make up the difference.
The successful relationship between the school, family,
and community depicted by Auerbach (2012b) is from the
perspective of the school leader. According to Auerbach, the
motivation fueling an authentic partnership is not for the
ultimate academic results of the students in the community,
family, and school, but instead for reasons fueled by social
justice--"it is the right thing to do" (p. 5). Auerbach (2012a)
presented a continuum contrasting the perspective of leader-
ship preventing partnerships and that of leadership for
authentic partnerships between the school, family, and com-
munity characterized by (a) respectful alliances, (b) dia-
logue across differences, and (c) sharing of power. Auerbach
(2012a) draws attention to the need for examples of success-
ful collaborations among schools, parents, and the commu-
nity from which school leaders can learn from and emulate.
Hands (2012) provided a case study example of what
authentic school, family, and community partnerships look
like. In short, authentic partnerships "stemmed from a prag-
matic understanding that community partnerships were nec-
essary to provide students with the learning experiences and
support they needed to succeed in school and beyond"
(p. 187). Furthermore, the most successful partnerships
"were those voluntarily established by partners rather than
those established by legislation or mandates for collabora-
tion" (p. 188).
Activities That Constitute Parent
Involvement
This study presents the following hypothesis: If the parent
involvement component is viewed as important and sustain-
able, the CIP becomes more sustainable. Gardner (2009)
reviewed the literature on parent involvement intervention
programs (Auerbach, 2001, 2004; ED, 2003, 2006; Perna,
2002; Plank & Jordan, 2001) and identified more than 30
specific activities intervention program administrators may
choose involving parents in helping the traditionally under-
served students in their programs become ready for college
(McClafferty, McDonough, & Fann, 2001; Perna & Titus,
2005).
Sustainability and the Capacity for
Sustainability
The connection between importance placed on a program
component (e.g., parent involvement) and capacity for sus-
tainability of the program (e.g., GEAR UP) is what our
research study addresses. Sustainability means different
things to different people, and it is important to define "types
of sustainability" (Scheirer & Dearing, 2011; Scheirer et al.,
2008). Two terms, sustainability (Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone,
1998; Pluye, Potvin, & Denis, 2004) and institutionalization
(Goodman & Steckler, 1987, 1989; Goodman, McLeroy,
Steckler, & Hoyle, 1993), have received the most attention
relevant to making innovations last beyond the grant period
or becoming a permanent part of an organization. Shediac-
Rizkallah and Bone (1998) chose the term sustainability to
capture the "general phenomenon of program continuation"
(p. 92) on the basis of sustainability as too broad and does not
"imply a static program" (p. 92), as does institutionalization
and routinization, but rather a dynamic and evolving con-
cept. Sustainability was the preferred term used by Johnson
Gardner and Marszalek 5
et al. (2004) and Pluye, Potvin, and Denis (2004), who built
on the work of Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone to further con-
ceptualize sustainability. Johnston et al. utilized sustainabil-
ity as their "overarching construct" because they believed it
was the only term "broad enough to incorporate the essential
elements of the other constructs, especially institutionaliza-
tion" (p. 137). Scheirer et al. (2008) and Scheirer and
Denning (2011) specify four different sustainability out-
comes: (a) continuing the project activities within the funded
organization, (b) sustaining benefits for clients, (c) maintain-
ing a collaborative structure, and (d) maintaining attention to
the issues. Adopting the rationale of Shediac-Rizkallah and
Bone (1998) in our study, sustainability is the preferred term,
and is defined as "the process of ensuring . . . a sustainable
innovation . . . can be integrated into ongoing operations to
benefit diverse stakeholders" beyond the time period of the
initial grant funding (Johnson et al., 2004, p. 137). In addi-
tion, in accordance with the Scheirer et al. (2008) frame-
work, sustainability is also defined as "continuing the project
activities within the funded organization" (p. 336). Finally,
our study assesses the perceived capacity of an organization
to become sustainable, similar to the work conducted by the
Doughterty (2011), which utilized various facets of sustain-
ability and measures to determine the potential for becoming
sustained within the organization:
The degree to which the indicators in each domain exist increases
the likelihood that a project or program has the resources, skills,
capacity, and knowledge necessary to sustain components over
time. The stronger the existence of indicators for each of the
domains, the more likely a project or program can be sustained.
(p. 1)
Researchers in the fields of education (Buchanan et al.,
2005) and organizational development (Foorman & Moats,
2004) have addressed sustainability, but the literature refer-
enced in our study to frame sustainability and the Parent
Involvement Component Sustainability Scale (PICSS) has
come out of the public health or health promotion field
(Goodman & Steckler, 1989; Johnson et al., 2004; Mancini
& Marek, 2004; Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone, 1998; Scheirer
et al., 2008). Our study does not rely on the conceptualiza-
tions found in organizational development, which primarily
are about helping organizations innovate in their thinking
rather than sustaining innovations within organizations or
beyond initial grant funding. In addition, the educational
innovation literature focuses on reforms within school sys-
tems, and these frameworks are less developed than those
found in the public health literature. The public health con-
ceptualizations are applicable to other areas of social science
programming where sustainability is also a concern, such as
in education, and are well developed through empirical and
theoretical research (Goodman & Steckler, 1987; Johnson et
al., 2004; Mancini & Marek, 2004; Pluye, Potvin, & Denis,
2004; Pluye, Potvin, Denis, & Pelletier, 2004; Pluye, Potvin,
Denis, Pelletier, & Mannoni, 2005; Shediac-Rizkallah &
Bone, 1998).
Sustainability and the capacity for sustainability is a con-
cern in public health and education because of the consider-
able funds devoted to interventions and innovations across
the United States and internationally to address health educa-
tion issues (Johnson et al., 2004). Public- and private-fund-
ing agencies are concerned with how scarce resources are
allocated, and desire their efficient use. The federal govern-
ment or private organizations provide seed money or demon-
stration grant funds to initiate health promotion programs
(e.g., Johnson et al., 2004) and expect the programs to con-
tinue beyond the time period of the grant. The grant-funded
programs are not just expected to continue, they are expected
to incorporate effective practices. Grant recipients are sub-
ject to the same pressures by the federal government or pri-
vate-funding agencies to become sustainable and demonstrate
effective outcomes, particularly in education.
Purpose
The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of
the program emphasis placed on parent involvement on the
capacity for sustainability of the parent involvement compo-
nent of a CIP. We hypothesized that the more importance a
CIP placed on its parent involvement component, and the
more parent involvement activities the CIP implemented, the
greater capacity for sustainability the parent involvement
component of the CIP would have.
Methods
Research Design
The design of this study was a web-based survey, specifically
an online questionnaire (Dillman, 2007; Fowler, 2002) that
involved a nonprobability, purposive, nonproportional, quota
sampling technique. The survey captured quantitative data
and open-ended responses from a cross-section of current
and former GEAR UP program administrators located
throughout the United States.
Population and Sample
The target population included all GEAR UP partnership
grant administrators from each of the GEAR UP partnership
grants (n = 418) and known local or regional entities (n =
388) within the state-awarded GEAR UP grant programs
funded by the ED between 1999 and 2007. The accessible
population in this study consisted of partnership grant recipi-
ents (n = 387) and local or regional entities within state
grants (n = 388) for which email addresses were obtained.
The final sample included 223 respondents, of which 143
(64%) were partnership grants (a response rate of 37%) and
80 (36%) were local or regional entities within state grants
6 SAGE Open
(a response rate of 21%). Of the respondents, 80 (35.9%)
GEAR UP programs received initial funding prior to or dur-
ing 2001 and 143 (64.1%) after 2001 (programs received
funding for a duration of 6 years, so those funded prior to
2001 had to obtain additional funding by the time of data col-
lection or cease operation). At the time of data collection,
184 (82.5%) of the respondents' GEAR UP programs were
still in operation.
Variables
Covariates.The covariates--status, type, and year--were
entered as dichotomous variables in the multiple regression
analysis to answer the research question. The program status
variable was coded as a 1 if it was in operation and 0 if it was
no longer in operation at the time of data collection. For the
grant type covariate, programs identified as a partnership
grant were coded as 1, and programs identified as a state
grant with local entities were coded with a 0. The covariate,
funding year, also was entered in the regression model as a
dichotomous variable. To clarify funding year, if the pro-
gram received initial funding from 1999 through 2001, indi-
cating that the initial grant funding time period would have
ended at the time of data collection, it was coded as 0, and if
the program received initial funding from 2002 through
2007, meaning that the program was at the end of the initial
grant period, it was coded as 1.
Importance of Parent Involvement variable. Nineteen total CIP
components were identified by Gardner (2009) through a
systematic review of the intervention literature (Cunning-
ham, Redmond, & Meriosotis, 2003; ED, 2003, 2006; Gan-
dara & Bial, 2001; Perna, 2002; Swail & Perna, 2002;
Tierney et al., 2005). Gardner (2009) originally created a
comprehensive list of 60 components, which was then
reduced to 19 after eliminating overlapping items. Respon-
dents were asked to rate the level of importance of each of
the 19 CIP components (e.g., Career counseling) on a 5-point
Likert scale:
Please identify the IMPORTANCE of each of the following
components to the GEAR UP program you specified.
IMPORTANCE is the amount of time, personnel, financial, or
other resources devoted to the component to help students
prepare for and be successful in college. (Gardner, 2009, p. 267)
Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to further
reduce the CIP components, and the Importance of Parent
Involvement variable emerged as a combination of two CIP
components, CIP 8-Parent Involvement and CIP
19-Volunteers are included in carrying out programs.
Parent involvement cluster variables.The parent involvement
cluster variables represented the activities implemented by
each GEAR UP program. Respondents'identified whether or
not 27 different parent involvement activities, identified in
the literature (Auerbach, 2001, 2004; ED, 2003, 2006;
McClafferty et al., 2001; Perna, 2002), were included in their
parent involvement component. One example item was,
"Boards, or committees include parents." Instructions pro-
vided to respondents were as follows:
The following activities may be part of the Parent Involvement
component within your GEAR UP program. Please identify
those activities that are currently part of your program by
checking the "Yes" button next to the activity. If the activity is
not part of your program, check the "No" button. If the GEAR
UP program you are familiar with is no longer functioning,
please identify the activities that were implemented when the
program was functioning. (Gardner, 2009, p. 267)
Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was then used to
identify clusters that grouped the parent involvement activi-
ties together based on similarity of responses. Visual inspec-
tion of the dendrogram output resulted in five clusters that
were labeled according to the content of their constituent
items: (a) Concern for Parents, (b) Personalization, (c)
Communication, (d) Inclusion, and (e) Services Provided.
Cluster scores were calculated by summing the items, and
were used as independent variables in subsequent multiple
regression analysis. Cluster scores represented the number of
times a type of activity was implemented within an individ-
ual program.
Capacity for the sustainability of parent involvement. The PICSS
was created to measure the participant perceptions of the
future capacity for sustainability for the GEAR UP parent
involvement components. The development of the PICSS
and its eight facets was based on a review of public health
literature addressing the capacity for sustainability of public
health innovations after grant funds end (Goodman & Steck-
ler, 1987, 1989; Johnson et al., 2004; Mancini & Marek,
2004; Pluye, Potvin, & Denis, 2004; Pluye, Potvin, Denis, &
Pelletier, 2004; Pluye et al., 2005; Scheirer & Denning, 2011;
Scheirer et al., 2008; Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone, 1998).
The PICSS covers eight content domains with roughly
equal numbers of items: planning early for sustainability,
having a program champion, funding, evaluation, collabora-
tion, community involvement, organizational structure, and
professional development. Respondents completed the
PICSS by identifying their level of agreement with each of
its 41 items (see Table 1 for a list of item stems). Respondents
selected their response from a 5-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The PICSS was
scored by averaging the items. Cronbach's alpha for the total
scale was .96. A PCA was conducted on the item responses,
and is reported in the Results section.

respondents to identify activities their programs imple-
mented, but were not listed in the questionnaire. Specific
parent involvement activities mentioned by respondents
were grouped together based on similarity. The second open-
ended question was asked to better understand what consti-
tutes the parent involvement component within GEAR UP:
"What advice do you have for other GEAR UP programs as
they implement the parent involvement component?"
Results
Analytical Plan
The five parent involvement cluster variables, and the
Importance of Parent Involvement variable (discussed
above), represented the independent variables in a multiple
regression model. The PICSS was used as the dependent
variable. Covariates in the model were type, year, and status
of the GEAR UP grant.
PCA
Importance of Parent Involvement variable.A PCA was con-
ducted using the 19 CIP components (hereafter referred to as
items for the sake of clarity). Preliminary diagnostics indi-
cated that all assumptions were met for PCA, including sam-
ple-to-item ratio (about 12 to 1), appropriate magnitudes of
Pearson correlations (none greater than .75), the correlation
matrix determinant (.004), and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) statistic (.827). The analysis was conducted in SPSS
v16 using Varimax rotation and the Kaiser criterion for com-
ponent extraction. Each of the 19 CIP items loaded onto 1 or
more of 6 extracted components (considering only those pat-
tern coefficients that were greater than .30), which explained
62.50% of the variance in the data. Only one item had no
pattern coefficients greater than or equal to .40: Academic
Skills Assessment, which has its highest pattern coefficient
of .37 on Component 2 (See Table 2).
Component 1 was interpreted to represent CIP items that
help students to become aware of supplementary education
and career activities implemented in conjunction with GEAR
UP programs. Component 1 items included the following:
After-School and Summer Jobs (CIP 2), Peer Group
Counseling (CIP 9), Job Shadowing (CIP 5), and One-on-
One Mentoring (CIP 7). Component 2 represented academic
and financial preparation that needs to take place while in
high school, so students can become eligible to take requisite
college courses and have access to financial aid resources.
The items loading onto Component 2 were SAT/ACT
Preparation Training (CIP 12), Rigorous Course Taking/
College Preparation Curriculum (CIP 11), Financial Aid
(Free Application for Federal Student Aid [FAFSA])
Counseling (CIP 4), Scholarships for Participation (CIP 13),
Career Counseling (CIP 1), and Academic Skills Assessment
(CIP 14). Component 3 was interpreted as the out-of-school
activities in which students participate to prepare for college,

and included Tutoring/Homework Assistance (CIP 16) and
Summer Programs (CIP 18). Component 4 includes Visits by
College Representatives (CIP 17), Motivational Speakers
(CIP 6), and Visits to Colleges for Tours (CIP 18), and were
interpreted as visitors and visits providing inspiration/moti-
vation to students to continue their efforts in pursuit of higher
education. Component 6 included the items Professional
Development for K-12 Educators (CIP 10) and Awareness of
College Opportunities (CIP 3), and seemed to take into
account the overall effect of educators in the school setting
on students' continuation their educations.
Component 5 accounted for an additional 8.68% of vari-
ance and contained two items, Parent Involvement (CIP 8)
with a loading of .771 and Volunteers Are Included in
Carrying Out Programs (CIP 19) with loading of .683.
Component 5 was interpreted as parent involvement. The
Importance of Parent Involvement variable was computed by
summing the item scores of Component 5.
PICSS
APCAwas conducted on the 41 items of the PICSS using the
Kaiser criterion for extraction. Although the KMO statistic
for the data was .95, indicating superior suitability
for PCA, only seven components were extracted rather than
the predicted eight corresponding to the content domain cov-
erage of the items. In addition, component coefficients with
Promax rotation did not correspond to the pattern anticipated
by the a priori subscales (i.e., one subscale for each content
domain). Therefore, a second PCA was conducted with the
specification of extracting one component. Results supported
a unidimensional structure for the scale in the form of a first
extracted eigenvalue ( = 17.45) that was over seven times
the size of the second ( = 2.42), which has greater signifi-
cance when one considers that over-extraction typically
occurs when the cases: items ratio is 5:1 or less (223/41 
5/1). The single-component solution explained 42.55% of
the variance in the items, and component coefficients ranged
from .46 to .78, with communalities from .21 to .61.
Component coefficients, uniquenesses, and descriptive statis-
tics for each of the item in the PICSS are included in Table 1.
These results justified treatment of the PICSS as a single
score representing capacity for sustainability rather than as
eight separate scores.
Preliminary Analyses
A screening of the data revealed severe skewness in several
variables, including the Importance of Parent Involvement
variable and four of the five parent involvement cluster

variables. Because multivariate normality is an assumption
of the multiple regression models intended for use in the
analysis, the variables were transformed using various
expressions to approximate normality (e.g., square root, nat-
ural logarithm, and inverse). Analyses were conducted with
the transformed variables, and repeated with the original
variables. Because the hypothesis test and effect size results
were the same for both sets of analyses, we retained the
results obtained with the original variables. Data screening
also revealed one multivariate outlier, and similar to the
treatment of nonnormal variables, we repeated analyses after
dropping the case. Again, because substantive results were
the same, we retained the results with the original data set
and report them here.
Several preliminary comparisons were performed; the
PICSS, the parent involvement cluster variables, and the
Importance of Parent Involvement were compared on grant
type, funding year, and funding status using independent
samples t tests. PICSS score differed significantly, t(35.81) =
3.01, p < .01, .95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.1, 0.68],
between programs that were (M = 3.95, SD = 0.55) and were
not (M = 3.54, SD = 0.72) in operation at the time of data
collection. Importance of Parent Involvement did not differ
on any of the three covariates. Programs initially funded in
2001 or previous years implemented more Communication
parent involvement activities (M = 3.54, SD = 0.76) than pro-
grams initially funded in 2002 or later (M = 3.20, SD = 1.08),
t(209.53) = 2.75, p < .01, .95% CI = [0.10, 0.59]. The number
of Communications activities implemented also differed sig-
nificantly between state grants and partnerships grants,
t(118.16) = 3.43, p < .01, as did the number of parent involve-
ment activities classified as Concern for Parents, t(127.73) =
2.00, p < .05; Inclusion, t(136.39) = 2.61, p = .01; and
Services Provided, t(192.47) = 3.27, p < .01; in each case,
partnership grants implemented more.
Pearson correlations were also examined among the fol-
lowing variables: amount of parent involvement in the
GEAR UP program (i.e., the five cluster variables), the
importance placed on parent involvement by the program
(i.e., Component 5: Importance of Parent Involvement), and
the capacity for sustainability of the parent involvement
aspects of the program (i.e., the PICSS). Correlations among
the cluster variables were all significant and ranged in mag-
nitude from .22 to .46, indicating varying degrees of associa-
tion. Correlations among the PICSS and the cluster variables
had a similar range in magnitude from weak-to-moderate
(.20) to moderately strong (.43). The Importance of Parent
Involvement variable had weak (e.g., .13, ns) to moderate
(e.g., .30) correlations with all variables. These relationships
provided evidence that the variables merited further exami-
nation in multiple regression, which would re-examine them
after controlling for the covariates of program type, status,
and funding year. See Table 3 for a summary of correlations,
means, and standard deviations. Pearson correlations were
also examined between the PICSS and each of the 19 CIP
components (see Table 2). The strongest correlation was
between the PICSS and CIP 8-Parental Involvement (r = .32,
p < .01), which made up one half of the Parent Involvement
Variable (i.e., Component 5). The other half consisted of CIP
19-Carrying Out Programs, which correlated with the PICSS
moderately (r = .18, p < .01). Correlations between the
PICSS and all other CIP components ranged from .02 (p =
.73) to .19 (p < .01).
Multiple Regression Analysis
Multiple regression was used to examine the relationships
among the Importance of Parent Involvement variable, the

funding status were used as controls in the analysis. A hierar-
chical-block approach was used, with the covariates entered
simultaneously as Block 1, the parental involvement cluster
variables as Block 2, the Importance of Parent Involvement
variable as Block 3, and interactions in Block 4. A full facto-
rial model was tested with the following interactions: Grant
type × Funding year, Grant type × Program status, Funding
year × Program status, and Grant type × Funding year ×
Program status. All assumptions, including homoscedasticity
and multivariate normality, were met for the full factorial
model and all subsequently reported models. In addition, all
models were tested for homogeneity of slopes by testing
each two-way interaction between a categorical covariate
and a continuous independent variable, and all such tests but
one were statistically nonsignificant. In the full factorial
model, the three-way interaction of the categorical covariates
was statistically nonsignificant, F(1, 208) = 0.08, p = .77, so
the model was adjusted by dropping that term and testing
each two-way interaction of the covariates in separate mod-
els, but none were significant. Evidence for one two-way
interaction between a categorical covariate, program type,
and a continuous independent variable, Importance of Parent
Involvement, was obtained in the form of a significant
regression coefficient ( = 1.27, p < .01), and the model con-
taining just this one interaction was retained (see Table 4).
The retained model explained a large amount (31%) of the
variance in total PICSS score, F(10, 212) = 11.15, p < .01,
adj. R2 = .31. The covariates (Block 1) explained 6% of the
total variance, a small-to-moderate amount, and the inclu-
sion of the cluster variables explained an additional 23%, a
large amount, which meant that the overall number of parent
involvement activities implemented by a program had a
strong association with the capacity for sustainability of par-
ent involvement.Although Importance of Parent Involvement
did not add a significant amount of explanatory power on its
own, F(1, 213) = 2.84, p = .09, R2 = .01, its interaction with
program type did, F(1, 212) = 8.36, p < .01, R2 = .03.
Program status had a statistically significant association ( =
0.16, p = .01), as did the level of certain categories of parent
involvement activities, such as Personalization ( = 0.18, p <
.01), Communication ( = 0.16, p = .02), and Inclusion ( =
0.26, p < .01). Program status had a moderate relationship, in
which an increase of 1.00 SD was associated with an increase
of 0.16 SD in PICSS when all other variables were con-
trolled. In other words, the difference in the capacity for sus-
tainability of parent involvement found between extant
programs and extinct programs in our preliminary t test was
confirmed even after all other variables had been controlled.
Programs in operation had an average PICSS score of 0.16
SD greater than programs out of operation. The regression
coefficients of Personalization, Communication, and
Inclusion were all small; an increase of 1.00 SD in any one of
these was associated with an increase of between 0.16 and
0.26 SD in PICSS score with other variables controlled. That
is, increases in any single type of the parent involvement
activities of Personalization, Communication, or Inclusion

ability of parent involvement in the program. Although an
increase in a single type of parent involvement activity was
related to improved capacity for sustainability somewhat, an
increase in three to five types of activities together was
related to substantial improvement.
Interaction.The interaction effect of Importance of Parent
Involvement and program type was significant, F(1, 212) =
8.36, p < .01, R2 = .03, and explained an additional 3% of
variance in PICSS score, a small amount. Figure 1 illustrates
the difference in regression slopes between state grant and
partnership grant programs when predicting PICSS score
from Importance of Parent Involvement with all other vari-
ables controlled. The slope of the line for the state grant
group is negative, but not statistically significant (B = -0.06,
SE = 0.05, p = .23), and the slope of the partnership group is
positive and statistically significant (B = 0.11, SE = 0.04, p <
.01). These results suggest that the importance that a pro-
gram places on getting parents involved is associated with an
increase in the capacity for sustainability of the parent
involvement component of that program, but only if the pro-
gram is part of a partnership grant. No association was iden-
tified in programs funded by a state grant. This interaction
effect is in addition to the unique main effects described
above.
Open-Ended Results
The open-ended data were analyzed by looking for emergent
themes, and through using the labels of the five parent
involvement clusters as preassigned codes. The analysis
found 50 comments (22%) addressed Personalization
(Cluster 2); 45 (20%) mentioned Communication (Cluster
3); and 61 (27%) mentioned Inclusion (Cluster 4), all vari-
ables that were found to have a small to medium effect on the
PICSS.
Personalization was the second parent involvement clus-
ter, and included three questionnaire items: (a) speaking the
same language as parents, (b) providing FAFSA counseling,
and (c) giving personal attention to parents' needs. One
respondent captured the personalization theme in terms of
relationships with the students: "Take time trust me there is
time to visit with all of these students, even after school. The
main point I learned is when the students are comfortable
with [the administrator] the parents are more likely to accept
all invitations."
Communication and recognizing parent's demands as a
theme represented one or more comments from 57 (26%)
different respondents. This theme is characterized by GEAR
UP personnel communicating information to parents through
a variety of methods, such as mailings, flyers, phone calls,
and home visits. This theme also represents the need for
GEAR UP personnel to acknowledge parents have many
demands on their schedules and desire involvement in their
children's education. One respondent captured this theme in
the following words: "Ask the parents what they already
know; what they want; what they need; and what they con-
sider to be important. Then, build your programs from there."
Another comment from a respondent captures the sensitivity
GEAR UP personnel should have toward parents in commu-
nication: "Be sensitive to culture, flexible scheduling,
involve parents in the planning, provide training in native
language." The following comment from another respondent
also captures the essence of this theme:
Don't expect parents to come to meetings or events, not because
they are not interested or don't care about their children but
because of time, other conflicts, fear. Reach out to parents in
other ways such as newsletters, e-mail, and college access
campaigns to start building relationships. Then offer workshops
and events. Some will come.
One respondent encouraged other GEAR UP administra-
tors to "Keep the lines of communication open at all times
NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO!"
Inclusion was the next theme identified in the open-ended
responses. Parent advisory committees were mentioned by
four respondents. This same structure was identified by other
respondents as a "Parent Action Committee." One respon-
dent captured the rationale for including parents and a pos-
sible approach toward parents: "Far too often we think we
know what they need. Until we bring them into the decision-
making process, we will continue to provide services that are
irrelevant to their immediate needs." Parents' views on what
their children need and on parents' help in making decisions
may enrich the parent involvement component, and serve as
a mechanism for increasing parent involvement itself.
Additional insight regarding the involvement of parents
on boards included advisory committees led by parents,
making sure the parent boards are ongoing, and giving par-
ents responsibility for planning events and reaching out to
other parents. Another respondent described the significant

role for parents within the GEAR UP program: "Parents
design the program and work on committees to keep the
interest going. They work with staff to participate in specific
opportunities that relate to their children's education. These
are ongoing committees." The parent advisory or action
committee theme was identified by other respondents who
listed parent leadership, parent board of trustees, parents
attending national conferences, and the training of parents.
The involvement of parents on boards and other decision-
making committees and activities was included among the
27 parent involvement activities in the questionnaire, and
may have adequately represented many of the respondents'
experiences. However, the detail provided by respondents
about the different types of boards or committees, and the
different involvement activities, further informs and enriches
the practice of involving parents in productive ways.
The inclusion cluster represents the many ways GEAR
UP personnel include parents' weekend programs, instruc-
tional programs for students, advising for parents, and hav-
ing parents work on committees or serve on decision-making
and planning boards. Respondents' comments encouraged
getting parents talking to parents, and having parents partici-
pate in a variety of activities. One suggestion that stood out
was to "pick a particular parent who is involved and use that
parent to help reach other parents." Another key point was
that parents need to work with GEAR UP personnel so that
everyone can recognize that they are working for the same
goal.
Discussion
Our results indicate program status (i.e., whether or not the
program was still extant) and the number of parent involve-
ment activities in which programs engaged from three sepa-
rate clusters or categories (Personalization, Communication,
and Inclusion) had small-to-medium associations with the
capacity for sustainability of the parent involvement compo-
nents of CIPS, and together explained a large proportion of
its variance. Although the importance programs placed on
incorporating parent involvement did not have a direct rela-
tionship, it did have a significant interaction with program
type (i.e., whether a program was funded with a state grant or
a partnership grant). These findings are discussed below.
The regression coefficient of program status seems to
indicate an association between the sustainability of parent
involvement program components and the sustainability of
the overall CIP itself. When all other variables are held con-
stant, the more sustainable the parent involvement compo-
nent is (i.e., the higher the PICSS score), the higher capacity
for sustainability. This relationship provides evidence of
consequential validity for PICSS scores.
The number of parent involvement activities a GEAR UP
program implemented that were identified as Personalization
had a small-to-medium relationship with PICSS score, and
the category consisted of three basic activities, the fewest
number of any cluster used in the analysis: (a) program per-
sonnel speak the same language as parents; (b) FAFSA coun-
seling is provided for parents; and (c) personal attention is
given to parents' needs. Personalization seems to indicate
activities in which program personnel constructively inter-
acted with parents on an individual basis. In contrast, the
seven activities identified as part of the Concern for Parents
cluster seem to share the characteristic of program policies
that take parent concerns into account. Two representative
activities were (a) differences in parents' ethnicity, educa-
tion, and socioeconomic status are respected and (b) flexible
scheduling of activities takes into account parents' work
schedules. The fact that Personalization had a significant
effect and that Concern for Parents did not seems to indicate
that CIPs should focus on improving individual interactions
between staff and parents to increase sustainability.
Communication activities were identified as having a
small-to-medium association on the PICSS, and represented
GEAR UP administrators' efforts to get information out to
parents about what was taking place and how parents could
become involved. In the open-ended portion of the survey,
when GEAR UP administrators provided advice in the form
of encouragement to keep on trying to involve parents, they
often mentioned efforts to communicate to parents about
what is occurring in the GEAR UP program. For example,
one respondent wrote that to involve parents, "communica-
tion is the KEY. Empower parents to have a vital role in
GEAR UP." Another respondent provided advice about how
to design communication in a way that grabs parents' atten-
tion: "keep mail outs simple and on point. Parents are too
busy to read lengthy literature. Something has to grab their
attention right off or it is tossed or set aside." We observed
more Communication activities on average in programs
funded in 2001 and prior than those funded in 2002 and after,
which suggests that current CIPS should rededicate them-
selves to implementing this type of activity.
Inclusion activities had the largest association with the
capacity for sustainability. The inclusion of parents in activi-
ties that get them highly involved in the programming, deci-
sion-making, and recruitment activities of GEAR UP enables
them to increase their networks with GEAR UP personnel,
educators, and others who can provide access to important
resources. Perhaps the most import networking is among
parents as they work together toward common goals, such as
the implementation of other program components. An
increase of one standard deviation in inclusion activities cor-
responds to an increase of over one-quarter of a standard
deviation in capacity for sustainability. The open-ended data
suggest administrators believe this type of involvement
results in benefits for both the parents and their children. The
purpose is not to increase the number of parents who are
attending meetings, classes, or workshops as passive partici-
pants, but instead to help parents become involved as advo-
cates in the education of their children, and of other
children for whom access to higher education is blocked.
14 SAGE Open
One respondent made the connection between parent
involvement and student benefits: "Parent support is one of
the most important ways to help the students. Do all you can
to get them involved and interested in the program, and then
do even more!"
Workshops and seminars are often identified as an effec-
tive way to involve parents, but merely holding a workshop
is not the best parent involvement activity (ED, 2003).
Merely holding a workshop, seminar, or class for parents
may not bring about positive results. Open-ended responses
indicated parents'needs were important considerations when
planning and selecting topics and incentives for parent par-
ticipation in workshops. One way parent workshops and
classes were more effective addressing parents' needs was
the involvement of a third party specializing in classes and
seminars for parents. This idea was introduced in the evalua-
tion of the first two years of GEAR UP (ED, 2003). The pres-
ent study found some GEAR UP programs had involved
contractors operating under the state grants to work with par-
ents in 9- or 10-week courses, where parents were recog-
nized for "graduating" if they attended a certain percentage
of the classes. Three respondents mentioned the organiza-
tion, Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE), and
praised the efforts of that program to help parents learn from
each other how to help their children. Created in 1987, PIQE
initially brought together parents in a San Diego community
to talk about their poor living conditions and the poor perfor-
mance of their children in school. The PIQE program grew
into weekly meetings for parents and several programs
throughout the State of California.
Another theme emerging from the analysis of the recom-
mended parent involvement activities was including parents
in GEAR UP planning and programming. The inclusion of
parents allows parents to take part in providing services to
their children and tailoring those services to meet individual
needs. Including parents is a high involvement activity, giv-
ing them real responsibilities, such as participating on plan-
ning committees, being part of decision-making bodies, and
reaching out to other parents to involve them in GEAR UP
services.
Interaction Between Importance of Parent
Involvement and Program Type
Although the importance programs placed on parent involve-
ment had no direct association with the capacity for sustain-
ability of their parent involvement components, one of the
key findings of this research study was the interaction
between program type (i.e., partnership grants vs. state
grants) and the importance placed on parent involvement in
the sustainability of the parent involvement program compo-
nent. Specifically, the importance of parent involvement had
a positive association with the PICSS score for partnership
type programs, but no association with state grant
programs.
When a partnership type program is applied for, the part-
nership must consist of one or more local education agen-
cies, one or more degree-granting institutions of higher
education, and "no less than two additional community orga-
nizations or entities such as businesses, professional organi-
zations, state agencies" (ED, 2011, pp. 52-53). State agencies
do not have the same expectations to create partnerships
prior to the submission of the grant. After receiving a state
type grant, it is typical that local entities resembling partner-
ship grants are then created to provide the GEAR UP ser-
vices. The creating of partnerships at a very early stage, by
partnership grant recipients, may provide for stronger part-
nerships and services more clearly focused on meeting the
needs of the local area, and these partnerships may have a
stronger focus on parent involvement or better carry out par-
ent involvement-focused services than recipients of state
grants. Partnership type grants, because of their early focus
on developing partnerships, are able to carry out GEAR UP
services in more personalized ways and focus on the needs of
the local area. We observed that partnership grants imple-
mented more parent involvement activities on average than
state grants in the areas of Concern for Parents,
Communication, Inclusion, and Services Provided.
Partnership type grants funded through the GEAR UP
organization, as opposed to GEAR UP state funded grants,
may accurately portray the concept of overlapping spheres of
influence introduced by Epstein (1995), Epstein and Jansorm
(2004), and Epstein and Lee (1995) and lead to the creation
of authentic partnerships discussed by Auerbach (2012a) and
described by Hands (2012). This conceptualization of a part-
nership is where the school, family, and community work
together to meet the needs of students, each filling in gaps
where the others are lacking. Partnership grants funded
through GEAR UP can facilitate the partnership between the
school, family, and community. The early planning that takes
place as GEAR UP partnership grants are prepared for sub-
mission is essential to program capacity for sustainability,
and is a good example of one faucet of the PICSS, which was
Planning Early for Sustainability (Goodman & Steckler,
1987; Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone, 1998; Pluye, Potvin, &
Denis, 2004; Pluye et al., 2005).
Limitations
Although we believe our sample is representative of GEAR
UP programs in the United States, our nonrandom sampling
methodology may not guarantee it, which somewhat limits
the generalizability of our results. In addition, the use of a
cross-sectional design precludes the use of temporal effects
as a source of support for causality. The analytical methods
we use are based on correlations, which are a necessary but
insufficient component of causality. Another limitation is the
self-report nature of the data used, which makes the results
vulnerable to social desirability bias. For example, some
GEAR UP administrators may have answered survey
Gardner and Marszalek 15
questions in ways they perceived as more acceptable to the
larger educational community. In an effort to reduce poten-
tial social desirability bias, all participants were informed
through an informed consent document that "neither you nor
the program you represent will be identified in the written
report with the findings reported in the aggregate . . . To pro-
tect you from identification, your responses will not be ana-
lyzed, reported, or otherwise connected with your name." An
area of focus for future research is the measuring of actual or
future sustainability, as this current study focused on the par-
ticipant perceptions of future capacity for sustainability.
Future studies can expand on our results by addressing these
limitations, but with the present findings, several lessons
apply to the broader CIP community.
Lessons Learned
Parent involvement within CIP's is recognized as an impor-
tant component of comprehensive intervention that helps
students from underserved backgrounds, particularly for stu-
dents who are the first in their family to attend college, aca-
demically underprepared, are members of an ethnic minority,
or are from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Parent
involvement is not an easy component to implement (ED,
2003); however, respondents participating in this study and
representing the perspectives of their GEAR UP funded pro-
grams believe parent involvement is beneficial for parents
and students in ways that make the struggle to implement it
worthwhile. The parent involvement activities that are rec-
ommended as a result of this study include getting parents in
highly involved and engaging activities, such as planning
activities for other CIP components for their children or for
other parents. Parents also can participate on decision-
making boards where they can give their input on the long-
term direction of the program, but especially the parent
involvement component. Programs should focus more on
increasing positive one-on-one interactions between parents
and staff and among parents. Finally, parents can recruit
other parents; parents who are natural leaders can reach out
to their peers and involve them in CIP-sponsored activities.
By participating, parents can develop valuable networks with
other parents who have not, themselves, attended college.
From a program development standpoint, the process of
applying for a GEAR UP partnership grant where K-12 and
higher education institutions, as well as community organi-
zations, are working together at the early stages of imple-
mentation are a great opportunity for key stakeholders in
building strong relationships, and identifying and solidifying
CIP components, such as parent involvement, in helping
underserved students make the transition from high school to
college. Furthermore, the successful implementation of par-
ent involvement is more likely when the schools, commu-
nity, and parents are working together to identify how
important components, such as parent involvement, can
become sustainable beyond the time period of the grant.
We conclude that parent involvement is in fact an impor-
tant component of any early intervention program seeking to
help students prepare for college, and parent involvement
activities providing the most beneficial outcome for parents
and their children are activities including parents in the plan-
ning, decision-making, and recruitment functions of the
GEAR UP program. GEAR UP services for parents should
begin as soon as services are offered to students, and parents
need recognition as an important part of GEAR UP services
from the beginning. Planning for sustainability is an issue
needing focus at the beginning of program planning, even as
groups representing schools and the community work
together submitting GEAR UP partnership grants, as indi-
cated by the moderation effect of the type of program imple-
mented on the relationship between the importance of parent
involvement and the capacity for sustainability of the GEAR
UP parent involvement program. The sustainability of the
CIP itself seems impacted.
