Introduction and Objective
Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important predictor of
cognitive function in old age. Early life circumstances, in-
cluding socioeconomic and related physical factors, are
thought to influence health across the life span (Dowd,
Zajacova, & Aiello, 2009; Karlamangla et al., 2009; von
Ehrenstein, Mikolajczyk, & Zhang, 2009). Education gen-
erally occurs in childhood and adolescence when neurode-
velopment is more rapid than in later life. More education is
frequently linked to better cognitive performance and is
thought to influence brain capacity and/or cognitive reserve.
Education as a feature of the early socioeconomic environ-
ment has later consequences for income and occupational
opportunity in adulthood, which is consistently linked to
midlife and late life health status. Thus, SES in early life
and midlife may indirectly influence cognitive aging via its
influence on health. However, income and occupation
change in old age and measures of these taken in old age do
not accurately reflect the effects of SES across the life span.
It is not clear whether it is the shape of the trajectory of SES
change over a lifetime or whether it is accumulated disad-
vantage that matters most to produce greater ill health in old
age in those with sustained exposure to poverty.
The bulk of work on lifetime SES trajectories or accumu-
lated disadvantage and cognitive aging has not included as-
sessment of the effects of race, ethnicity, or migration and
cultural change on the life-span trajectory and cognitive
performance. However, there is growing evidence that the
impact of life course trajectories on cognitive aging may vary
by ethnicity (Clarke, O'Malley, Johnston, & Schulenberg,
2009; Haas & Rohlfsen, 2009). Migration may affect the
trajectory of both SES and health status, leading to differ-
ences in cognitive aging by migration history in later life.
Moreover, the effects of migration on late life health may
not be restricted to a single generation. Intergenerational
improvements in economic and educational opportunities
achieved by migration may lead to better health and cogni-
tive aging in newer generations. Sustained intergenerational
exposures to low or high SES or to upward or downward
mobility are often driven by environmental changes, such as
migration. The trajectory of early life to adult SES may or
may not be modified by changes in cultural and socioeco-
nomic contexts that accompany migration. Although up-
ward mobility is often an intended goal of migration,
downward mobility or sustained deprivation are also com-
mon consequences.
The purpose of this work is to examine the association
between socioeconomic trajectories from childhood through
adulthood with late life cognitive performance over 9 years
on cognitive tests of global ability and verbal memory done
in a cohort of immigrant and U.S.-born Mexican Ameri-
cans. We will also evaluate the potential modifying role of
migration on the association between lifetime SES and late
life cognitive performance.

Objectives. Early life circumstances influence health across the life span. Migration and ethnicity may modify the
lifetime trajectory of socioeconomic status (SES) and lead to heterogeneity in cognitive aging in later life.
Methods. We examined the effects of both lifetime socioeconomic trajectory and cumulative disadvantage from
childhood through adulthood on late life cognitive performance in a 9-year cohort of 1,789 Mexican Americans aged
60­100 years in 1998­1999.
Results. Compared with those with low SES sustained over the life course, we found that those with more advantaged
lifetime SES trajectories experienced fewer declines on a test of global cognitive function and a short-term verbal
memory test. These associations are larger in first- and second-generation immigrant families.
Discussion. Heterogeneity of cognitive aging among diverse race/ethnic groups may be influenced by intergenera-
tional changes in SES, cultural norms, and behaviors and changes in health related to changes in the social and physical
environment.

Methods
Study population
Participants included in this analysis were from the Sac-
ramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). SALSA is
a longitudinal cohort study of 1,789 community-dwelling
Mexican Americans residing in California's Sacramento
Valley who were aged 60­101 years at baseline in 1998­
1999. The majority of the participants were born in Mexico
(51%) or the United States (49%). The study population and
the recruitment of SALSA participants have been described
in detail elsewhere (Haan et al., 2003). Participants were
followed every 12­15 months via home visits that included
clinical and cognitive assessments. A semiannual phone call
was made to obtain updates on medications, health events,
and some sociodemographic risk factors. Annual attrition
from baseline through 2008 averaged 5%, including mortal-
ity and loss to follow up. SALSA was approved by the Insti-
tutional Review Board at the University of Michigan and
the University of California at San Francisco and Davis.
Measures
Cognitive performance tests.--At each home visit, which
was every 12­15 months, the participant received two cog-
nitive tests: the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination
(3MSE) and the Spanish English Verbal Learning Test
(SEVLT). The 3MSE is a 100-point cognitive exam compo-
sed of several cognitive domains that provides an assess-
ment of global cognitive function. It has greater sensitivity
and specificity and fewer floor and ceiling effects for detect-
ing impairment than the Mini-Mental State Examination
and has excellent test­retest properties (Teng & Chui, 1987;
Tombaugh, 2005). The 3MSE has been validated and field
tested in Spanish and English. The SEVLT is a delayed
word list recall test with four 15-word memory trials, an
interference list, followed by a fifth trial, which is usually
used as the test score (Gonzalez, Mungas, & Haan, 2002,
2005; Gonzalez, Mungas, Reed, Marshall, & Haan, 2001).
The SEVLT was developed (Gonzalez et al., 2005) for use
in SALSA and has been validated in both Spanish and Eng-
lish and used in other studies. Participants were allowed to
be interviewed in the language of their choice.
Dementia/cognitive impairment without dementia--The
procedures to diagnose dementia and cognitive impairment
without dementia (CIND) have been described in detail
elsewhere (Haan et al., 2003). Briefly, there were several
phases of cognitive screening, a clinical exam and magnetic
resonance imaging for suspected dementia cases. Standard
diagnostic criteria for dementia from Diagnostic and Statis-
tical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., were applied.
This procedure was highly sensitive (100%) and specific
(75.1%). Those with dementia/CIND at baseline are exclud-
ed from these analyses.
Socioeconomic mobility from childhood to adulthood
Childhood SES.--In baseline interviews, study partici-
pants reported the years of education completed by their
mothers and fathers. Most parents did not have any formal
schooling (50% of mothers and 49% of fathers), and moth-
er's and father's education was classified as low (did not
complete elementary school) or high (completed elementa-
ry school or more). Mother's occupation was classified as
low (manual or housewives) or high (nonmanual), and
father's occupation was classified as low (manual or unem-
ployed) or high (nonmanual). Childhood food deprivation
was measured by participants' reports as to how often they
did not have enough to eat while growing up. Because 23%
reported that they at least sometimes experienced food
deprivation, this variable was recoded as "ever" or "never."
Participants also reported the number of siblings that sur-
vived to adulthood as an indicator of early SES environ-
ment, which was then classified as "yes" (a sibling died in
childhood) or "no" (none died). (All participants had at
least one sibling.) Each variable included in the childhood
SES score was dichotomized. To measure childhood SES,
we created a composite measure that combined mother's
and father's education and occupation, food deprivation,
and early sibling mortality. Ranging from 0 to 6, childhood
SES score was then collapsed into two categories as high
(29.2%) and low (70.8%).
Adult SES.--Participant's education was obtained at the
baseline interview by asking how many years of education
they had completed. This was categorized into low (less
than high school) or high (high school or more).
Participant's occupation was classified as low (manual, un-
employed, or housewives) or high (nonmanual). Partici-
pants also reported their current monthly household
income, which was split at the median with low (income <
$1,500) or high (income greater $1,500). An additive
scale was created that combined participant's education,
occupation, and income that ranged from 0 to 3, where 3
denoted worse SES. Adulthood SES was then collapsed
into two categories as high adulthood SES (26.4%) and low
adulthood SES (73.6%).
The two-level childhood SES was then cross-classified
with the two-level adulthood SES creating a four-level SES
mobility variable, with each level representing a distinct SES
trajectory from childhood to adulthood: all low (54.7%), high
to low (18.7%), low to high (16.1%), and all high (10.5%). In
analyses, all low was used as the reference category.
Cumulative SES disadvantage
A scale to measure the cumulative SES disadvantage
(CD) across the life course was constructed by summing the
dichotomous variables for childhood SES, education, life-
time occupation, and participants' late life household in-
come into a scale ranging from 0 to 9.

Nativity, number of generations born in Mexico, and
birth cohort
Nativity was based on the participant's self-report of
their country of birth. Participants were either born in the
United States or born in the Mexico and migrated to the
United States. They also reported nativity for their parents
and grandparents. We comprised "generations" since mi-
gration as the number reported by the participants out of
three generations (e.g., grandparents, parents, and self)
that had been born in Mexico (e.g., all in United States =
Gen 0 [5.7%], grandparent only = Gen 1 [4.2%], parent
and grandparent = Gen 2 [39.2%] or self, and parents and
grandparents = Gen 3 [51%]). Participants were born
between 1898 and 1939, and birth cohort was coded by
birth year as: below 1920, 1920 and above to below1930,
and 1930 and above.
Sociodemographic and health covariates
Health variables known from our previous work to be as-
sociated with cognitive function and dementia were selected
for this analysis. Fasting glucose level was measured from
blood drawn at each visit. Diabetes was defined by self-report
of a physician diagnosis, use of diabetes medication, and/or
a fasting glucose level greater or equal to 126 mg/dl (ADA,
2006). Prescription medication was obtained by a medicine
cabinet inventory at the annual home visit and coded into
groups. Blood pressure was measured using standard blood
pressure protocols (Beevers, Lip, & O'Brien, 2001). Base-
line hypertension was defined based on self-report of a MD
diagnosis or a baseline systolic blood pressure greater than
140 mm Hg or a baseline diastolic blood pressure greater
than 90 mm Hg (Association, 2010). Baseline stroke was
defined by self-report of an MD diagnosis, including hospi-
talization for stroke. Participants also reported whether they
had health insurance as well as their smoking status (ever
vs. never) and alcohol consumption. These did not vary by
SES or nativity and were not included in further analyses.
Statistical analyses
Analyses in this study included 1,626 participants who
did not have a dementia/CIND diagnosis at baseline. De-
scriptive statistics of the study population were compared
across the two nativity groups and two-tailed chi-square
tests for categorical variables, and one-way analysis of vari-
ance for continuous variables were used to test for differ-
ences. Mixed linear models with repeated measures options
were used to model the associations between SES and the
two cognitive outcomes. The 3MSE was coded as the natu-
ral log of errors (log [101-score]) in order to approximate
normality for the mixed linear models. Analysis of longitu-
dinal change in the 3MSE log of errors revealed an inverse
"u" nonlinear trajectory over time that was characterized by
an improvement in test scores through follow-up Visit 2 and
a subsequent decline in test scores through the last visit.
After model-fitting tests, segmented regression was used for
this analyses that involved the use of two separate time pe-
riods broken at or before or after the second follow-up visit.
This is sometimes attributed to practice effects; however,
Tombaugh (2005) has reported minimal such effects over
periods of retesting more than a year.
The SEVLT met the normality assumptions of the mixed
linear model and was not transformed. Segmentation was
not used for the SEVLT because the association between
time and SEVLT score was linear. In SEVLT models, time
was treated as the visit number. After evaluation of unad-
justed models including only the three SES terms (not
shown), Model 1 included interactions between time and
each indicator variable (high to high, high to low, and low to
high) compared with those who remained low. Model 2
added adjustment for sociodemographic and health-related
covariates. A similar strategy was pursued for the cumula-
tive deprivation scale.
Data analysis.--Several methods have emerged in an at-
tempt to deal with any biasing effects of attrition from lon-
gitudinal studies. These include restriction of the analysis to
participants with complete data on all variables of interest,
often called list-wise deletion analysis. However, the value
of such restriction is founded on the unlikely assumption
that data are missing completely at random (Rubin, 1976),
which is rarely met in population-based studies. Therefore,
we selected a more efficient and less restrictive approach for
the analyses in the present study. We used a multiple imputa-
tion approach that conditioned on all data set variables as
predictors in a sequence of multiple regressions (Raghuna-
than et al., 2001; Rubin, 1987). The different imputations
are run in a cyclic manner that overwrites previously drawn
values and in the interdependence between the imputed val-
ues. By using all available variables, the multiple imputa-
tion approach provides unbiased estimates while improving
statistical efficiency. Five imputed data sets were produced
that include all study variables and used for this analysis.All
multiple linear regression models (PROC MIXED) were run
in sets of five and summarized with PROC MIANALYZE
(SAS v. 9.2).
Results
Table 1 displays covariates by the number of generations
born in Mexico (0­3) for the study population. The percent
of women was highest among Gen 0 and Gen 3 families.
Gen 0 and Gen 3 families were slightly older than Gen 1 or
Gen 2.Year of birth did not vary significantly by generation.
Participant education was highest in Gen 0 and Gen 1 fami-
lies and lowest in Gen 3 families. Participants from Gen 3
and Gen 0 families had the highest percent of manual oc-
cupations compared with Gen 2 families. Nearly everyone
had health insurance, but in Gen 3 families, 16.3% did not.
The percent of participants whose fathers' and mothers'
education was less than elementary school was highest
NATIVITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS IN COGNITIVE AGING i105
among Gen 2 and Gen 3 families. The percent of fathers
with a manual occupation was highest in Gen 1 families.
Hunger in childhood was lowest in Gen 3 families and
highest in Gen 1 families. Sibling childhood mortality was
highest in participants from Gen 3 families. Low SES in
childhood or adulthood was highest in Gen 2 and Gen 3
families. Cumulative SES disadvantage was highest in
Gen 3 families followed by Gen 2 families with the least
CD-SES in Gen 0 families.
Baseline 3MSE errors were highest in Gen 3 families,
followed by Gen 2, Gen 0, and Gen 1 families. A similar
pattern was seen in the number of words recalled for the
baseline SEVLT. There were no differences by generation
in the median number of visits at which the 3MSE or the
SEVLT was assessed. Diabetes was most prevalent among
Gen 3, followed by Gen 0, Gen 2, and Gen 1, respectively.
Gen 3 diabetics were less likely to be treated than Gen 0
diabetics. Stroke and hypertension were highest in Gen 0
and lowest in Gen 3. Systolic blood pressure was highest in
Gen 3 and lowest in Gen 0. Diastolic blood pressure did not
differ by generation.
Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of lifetime SES trajec-
tories by the number of generations born in Mexico. Among
all U.S. (Gen 0) families, there was considerable upward
and downward mobility in the lives of study participants,
split roughly equally between low to high and high to low.
About 34% maintained high SES across the life span.
Among grandparent-only families (Gen 1), 35% were al-
ways low, 32% went from low to high, 21% were always
high, and nearly 12% went from high to low. Among two-
generation families (Gen 2), nearly 45% remained low, 27%
went from low to high, 14.5% remained high, and 13.5%
went from high to low. Among three-generation families
(Gen 3), more than 66% remained low, 5% remained high
SES, 5.6% improved in SES, and nearly 23% of participants
declined from high to low SES. Across generations, the per-
cent of participants who remained in a low SES position
declined as more generations were born in the United States.
Downward mobility was highest in Gen 0 and Gen 3,
whereas upward mobility was similar in Gen 0, Gen 1, and
slightly lower in Gen 2. Upward mobility was lower in Gen
3. The median number of cumulative deprivations remained
at 7 for the always low group and 3 for the always high
group; upwardly mobile had a median of five deprivations
except inGen 1 and downwardly mobile had by generation:
5.5 (Gen 0), 5 (Gen 1), and 6 (Gen 2 and Gen 3).

Table 2 presents the results of two sequential mixed linear
models with the log of errors for the 3MSE as the dependent
variable. Model 1 shows that those who maintained high
SES throughout life and those who moved from low to high
SES experienced fewer errors on the 3MSE compared with
those who remained at low SES in childhood and adulthood.
Those who moved from high to low SES also had fewer
3MSE errors than the low­low group, but the effect was
slight compared with the high­high and low­high groups.
Interactions between the three SES trajectory categories and
the two time period variables were not statistically signifi-
cant (not included in Table 2). Adjustment for covariates
(Model 2) reduced the coefficients for high­high and low­
high groups by about 18% and only slightly affected the
high to low group compared with the low to low group. The
3MSE log errors among those remaining at high SES and
for those moving from low to high SES are the same, where-
as there is much less benefit among those moving from high
to low. Older age and a larger number of generations born in
Mexico were associated with more 3MSE log errors as was
health insurance, diabetes, and stroke but not hypertension.
Log errors on the 3MSE declined in the first time period and
increased in the second. The association of the first time
period to 3MSE log errors is negative and unaffected by

adjustment for covariates, whereas the coefficient for the
second time period is positive (more errors) and is reduced
by 50% when covariates are added to the model.
In a separate analysis using mixed linear models, the bi-
variate association between childhood SES and 3MSE log
of errors was statistically significant (b = .20, p = .001), but
addition of adult SES (b = .74, p  .0001) to the model re-
duced the association between childhood SES and 3MSE
by 50% (b = .01, p = .04). Because the coefficient for child-
hood SES remained significant but slight, it appears that
adult SES partially mediates the association between early
SES and cognitive function in old age.
Table 3 presents the results for two sequential mixed lin-
ear models with the cumulative disadvantage scale (CD) as
a predictor for the 3MSE log of errors. Greater cumulative
lifetime disadvantage was modestly associated with more
3MSE log errors, equivalent to a 2.1-point increase in errors
for a 5-point difference in CD (the average). Adjustment for
covariates only slightly affected the association between
CD and the log of errors on the 3MSE. Compared with Gen 3
(all Mexican generations), Gen 0 was not associated with
change in the logerrors on the 3MSE and Gen1 and Gen 2
had fewer log errors on the 3MSE. The greatest benefit for
3MSE scores is among Gen 1, followed by Gen 2, and then
Gen 0 compared with Gen 3, suggesting a nonlinear pattern
of effects by generation. Neither the association between
CD nor the generations and 3MSE errors were modified by
time/study period (not shown). The association between CD
and 3MSE was not modified by the number of generations
born in Mexico. Lack of health insurance, diabetes, and
stroke were all associated with more errors on the 3MSE,
and hypertension was not associated with the 3MSE. Tests
for interaction between birth cohort and number of Mexican-
born generations in relation to the log of errors on the 3MSE
were not significant (not shown).
Table 4 presents the results for two sequential mixed lin-
ear models that evaluate the association between SES tra-
jectory categories and the SEVLT score as the dependent
variable. Compared with those in the always-low group, the
always-high and the low­high group had higher SEVLT
scores. The high­low group and the low­high group had
significantly better scores than the always-low group. Time
modified the associations between SES trajectory and the
SEVLT such that all scores declined over time, most rapidly
in the high­high and the low­high groups. This interaction
was only significant for the high­high and the low­high
groups compared with the always-low group. Adjustment
for covariates had little influence on the association between
SES trajectory and SEVLT score. Older age, lack of health
insurance, diabetes, and stroke were all associated with
lower SEVLT scores. Number of generations was not asso-
ciated with the SEVLT score. Tests for interaction between
birth cohort and number of Mexican-born generations in re-
lation to the SEVLT were not significant (not shown).
In a separate analysis, the bivariate association between
childhood SES and SEVLT score was statistically significant

(b = .41, p = .003), but addition of adult SES (b = 1.33, p 
.0001) to the model reduced the association between child-
hood SES and SEVLT by 43% (b = .23, p = .06). Because
childhood SES was no longer significant, it appears that
adult SES mediates the association between early SES and
cognitive function in old age.
Table 5 presents the results for two sequential mixed lin-
ear models that evaluate the association between cumulative
deprivation (CD) score and the SEVLT score as the depen-
dent variable. The number of Mexican-born generations is
included as a categorical variable, and interactions test

modified by the number of generations. Compared with
those with all three generations born in Mexico, those with
only grandparents (Gen 1) or with grandparents and parents
born in Mexico (Gen 2) performed better on the SEVLT. All
U.S.­born generations (Gen 0) did not differ from all Mexico­
born generations (Gen 3) on the SEVLT. Generations mod-
ified the association between cumulative deprivation and
SEVLT such that the SEVLT score was lower in Gen 1 or
Gen 2 as the number of deprivations increased.
Nativity and migration are important predictors of the life
time trajectories of SES, and they modify the relationship
of lifetime SES to late life cognitive aging. There is more
downward mobility in Gen 0 (22%) and Gen 3 (23%) than
in Gen 1 (12%) and Gen 2 (13.5%) and more upward mobil-
ity in Gen 1 and Gen 2 than in Gen 0 and Gen 3. The highest
level of sustained poverty is in Gen 3 (all Mexico), and the
highest level of sustained (relative) affluence is in Gen 0 (all
United States). Participants who are immigrants are more
likely to remain poor, whereas participants whose parents
and/or grandparents are U.S. born more likely to improve in
SES. The greater occurrence of downward mobility in the
three U.S. generation group of participants may reflect de-
clines in SES seen in more acculturated postimmigrant gen-
erations (Duncan & Trejo, 2008).
In this analysis, lifetime SES trajectories have strong
overall influence on both global cognitive function and
short-term verbal memory such that those who are advan-
taged in both childhood and adulthood experience fewer
declines in global cognition and verbal memory compared
with those who are less advantaged. Upward mobility is
similarly beneficial for these outcomes. The number of gen-
erations since migration to the Unites States also modifies
the effects of cumulative deprivation on global cognitive
performance and on memory. Compared with Gen 3 par-
ticipants, CD has more benefit for global cognition in Gen
0, Gen 1, or Gen 2 participants. Verbal memory is more ad-
versely affected by CD in Gen 1 and Gen 2 participants
compared with Gen 0 or Gen 3 participants. Importantly,
the links between early SES and late life cognitive aging
appear to be at least partly mediated by adult SES. This
points to a pattern of accumulated deprivation (or improve-
ment), but the influences of upward and downward mobility
on cognitive aging suggest that nonlinear patterns are also
important.
Discussion
Other studies (Harper et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2001;
Karlamangla et al., 2009; Kok et al., 2006; Turrell et al.,
2002; von Ehrenstein et al., 2009) have reported that life-
time SES is associated with late life cognitive functioning.
A recent study of a Chinese birth cohort (Zhang et al., 2009)
suggested that early life SES has an association with late
life cognitive function that is not explained by markers of
early nutritional development. Our results are consistent
with these other studies. Although we have little informa-
tion about early nutritional status (other than reports of sib-
ling mortality and lack of food), we can indirectly infer the
quality of the early environment from life expectancy (LE)
at birth in Mexico or in the United States during the time
period our study participants were born (1899­1939). In
1900, LE at birth in Mexico was about 27 years and in the
United States, it was 48 years. By 1938, LE at birth had
risen to 39 in Mexico and 62 in the United States. LE at
birth is a summary marker of environmental improvements
affecting survival in children below 5 years (Johansson,
2008). These LE data suggest that socioenvironmental and
health quality in early life for our study participants differed
sharply by country of birth. Improvements in LE over the
40 years from 1898 to 1938 suggest that the early environ-
ment of younger participants was comparatively better than
of older participants. However, comparison of the influence
of numbers of generations on late life cognitive aging by
birth cohort did not reveal any effect modification.
This study was only able to follow participants from
older ages for a maximum of 9 years. As such, data on early
life SES are entirely retrospective. Attrition from the cohort
due to death may have lead to underestimates of the asso-
ciation between lifetime SES and late life cognitive func-
tion, as both early and later life SES are inversely associated
with higher mortality. We do not have measures of cognitive
ability in early life as some studies have (Luciano et al.,
2009). However, those studies have also experienced very
substantial attrition across five to six decades and are likely
to be biased in their estimates. Health and economic selec-
tion are common features of the study of migration and are
thought to result in an immigrant population that is at least
initially healthier and wealthier than the population remain-
ing in the sending country or than native born in the receiv-
ing country. We cannot account for this issue directly here.
However, the average length of residence in the United
States was 35 years for participants who migrated. The
force of migration selection is likely to be weakened over
time by adaptation and increasing exposure to the new envi-
ronment and would have no direct relevance for migration
by previous generations (Gen 1 and Gen 2).
This analysis has shown that both early life and midlife
SES have individual effects on cognitive aging. The effects
on cognitive aging of early SES are partially mediated by
midlife SES. We have demonstrated that nativity and migra-
tion are related to differences in lifetime SES trajectories.
The heterogeneity of cognitive aging trajectories observed
among diverse race/ethnic groups may be influenced by in-
tergenerational changes in SES, cultural norms, and behav-
iors and changes in health related to changes in the social
and physical environment. Lifetime trajectories of change
in SES may not be linear. The literature on life course sug-
gests that there may be cumulative or "chained" effects of
SES and/or that SES exposures in a specific stage, for
example, early childhood, may have a major role in late life

cognitive aging. These differences are important in deter-
mining when and how to intervene. Our results for upward
and downward mobility suggest that modifications in the
SES trajectory are possible. Education is a highly modifi-
able SES factor that is thought to directly affect neurodevel-
opment and certainly can lead to better jobs and more
income. In the United States, there are nearly 46 million
U.S. residents who are Hispanic, of whom nearly 30 million
were born in Mexico (Pew Hispanic Center, 2010). Of the
Mexican ancestry population in the United States, only 28%
have a high school diploma, 41% are employed in manual
occupations, and 21% are living in poverty. The percent of
three-generation U.S.-born families among Mexican Amer-
icans increased from 37% to 57% between 1980 and 2007.
More than 50% of immigrants from Mexico are unautho-
rized and are likely to remain in sustained poverty through-
out their life span. In fact, the second and third generations
postmigration have lower high school graduation rates than
other race/ethnic groups. The impact of migration and nativ-
ity on lifetime SES trajectories and their effects on cognitive
aging are largely unexplored but may have important impli-
cations for future population health.
