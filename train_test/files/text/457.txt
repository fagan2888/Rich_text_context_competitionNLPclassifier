Iron overload is associated with significant morbidity and mortality yet is easily treated. The objective of
this study was to create a tool that could be easily adapted to clinical practice that indicates the likelihood
of a patient having undetected iron overload. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) 1999-2002 for US adults aged 20 years and older to build a model (unweighted n=8,779). We
chose potential variables for inclusion that could be gathered by self-report or measured without laboratory
data and were suggested by past literature on hemochromatosis and iron overload. We computed logistic
regressions to create the scores by initially evaluating the variables' relationship with elevated ferritin and
elevated transferrin saturation and then using odds ratios to correspond to scores. The resulting score on
the IRon Overload ScreeNing Tool (IRON) was then validated with data on 13,844 adults in the NHANES III,
1988-94. Predictors in the final tool were age, gender, previous diagnoses of liver condition, osteoporosis
or thyroid disease. The IRON score yielded an area under the curve (AUC) in the NHANES 1999-02 of 0.720
and an AUC of 0.685 in the NHANES III validation sample. The IRON score is a tool to assist in identifica-
tion of patients with iron overload that has several qualities that make it attractive for use in clinical prac-
tice with an undifferentiated patient population including brevity, easily collected information and predictive
ability comparable to other tools that help in directing screening. Am. J. Hematol. 86:733­737,

Introduction
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), once considered a
rare disease, is now recognized as one of the most com-
mon autosomal recessive disorders, occurring in approxi-
mately five persons per 1,000 in populations of northern
European descent. Approximately one million people in the
United States are at risk for development of iron overload,
attributable primarily to HH; in addition one in 10 non-
Hispanic Whites is a carrier [1,2]. This inborn error of iron
metabolism is characterized by excessive dietary iron
absorption, which in a subset of patients leads to progres-
sive iron accumulation and reaching toxic levels by middle
life [3,4]. The excess iron is deposited in multiple organs,
causing oxidative tissue damage and substantial morbidity.
The disease progresses silently and often is not discovered
until irreversible damage has occurred. However, these dis-
ease manifestations can be prevented by therapeutic phle-
botomy to remove excess iron [5]. Thus, there is a strong
rationale for early detection of this treatable condition to
achieve an optimal outcome.
Most patients with HH are homozygous for a mutation in
the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene at position 282 (C282Y)
of the HFE protein [6]. A second common mutation results
in substitution of aspartic acid for histidine at position 63
(H63D); its relationship to iron overload is less clear,
although compound heterozygosity with C282Y (C282Y/
H63D) has been associated with iron overload in some
patients.
Universal screening is not currently recommended by the
American College of Physicians or the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force, although there is value of early
identification [7,8]. With no universally accepted screening
recommendations for hemochromatosis or iron overload,
detection in an undifferentiated patient population in pri-
mary care is difficult and may lead to detection late in the
course of illness, missing the opportunity for the use of
appropriate therapy that can prevent clinical manifestations
and organ dysfunction [9,10].
Although the identification of the HFE gene and the com-
mon C282Y and H63D mutations related to hemochromato-
sis suggests potential screening based on these mutations,
large population-based screening studies have shown that
disease penetrance in HFE-related hereditary hemochro-
matosis is lower than previously believed, making universal
population-based screening for iron overload with genetic
markers unattractive [11]. In addition, although detection of
HH in presymptomatic stages is desirable, it is also impor-
tant to identify affected persons who have begun to develop
early disease manifestations, and this may have a higher
yield than population-based screening.
One of the problems of identifying patients with HH in
clinical practice is that the disease manifestations are simi-
lar to those found in other common disorders. However,
once identified, many of the complications can be reversed
by phlebotomy therapy [12]. Consequently, targeted screen-

ing or case finding based on clinical features associated
with iron overload is a useful strategy.
One way to identify iron overload may be to use a multi-
variable risk score. Many conditions, like iron overload,
have multiple risk factors that might increase the clinician's
suspicion and need for screening or targeted case finding.
A risk score simplifies clinical decision making by taking
many risk factors for an outcome and combining them into
a single predictive measure. It is not practical to evaluate
mentally the relative influence of more than two or three
risk factors at a time, so a risk score provides an auto-
mated way to take into account the relationships among
risk factors and is a valuable way to target resources for
case finding of individuals with ongoing disease [13,14].
Current guidelines for a number of conditions, such as
osteoporosis and diabetes, recommend screening or treat-
ment based on the use of risk scores [15,16]. However, no
multivariate risk score exists to guide targeted screening for
iron overload. Our goal was to create a tool that indicates
the likelihood of undetected iron overload in a general pop-
ulation and that could be easily adapted to clinical practice.
Materials and Methods
Description of data sets and participants. Data used in this study
were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) 1999­2002 and the NHANES III (1988­1994). These
surveys were nationally representative samples of the noninstitutional-
ized US population. Conducted in 1988­1994, the NHANES III included
over 40,000 participants from 89 communities across the United
States. In 1999, the survey became a continuous program with a
changing focus on a variety of health and nutrition measurements to
meet emerging needs. The NHANES 1999­2002 examined a nationally
representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These per-
sons were located in communities across the country, 15 of which were
visited each year. To produce reliable statistics, NHANES over-samples
persons 60 and older, African Americans, and Hispanics [17]. The
NHANES includes physical exams, laboratory tests, and interviews with
participating individuals. We used the NHANES 1999­2002 to develop
our risk score and the NHANES III to validate it. The entire NHANES
1999­2002 sample 20 years old was used to develop the risk score,
and NHANES III participants 20­74 years old were used to validate the
risk score. Participants 75 years old were excluded from our
NHANES III data set because an essential question about iron was not
asked of these persons.
Identification of elevated iron measures. Our risk score is intended
to predict cases with elevated iron measures, potentially indicative of
iron overload in an undifferentiated patient population. Here, the term
elevated iron measures refer to an individual having both elevated
transferrin saturation and elevated serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation
(%) was calculated as the ratio of serum iron concentration to total iron
binding capacity (TIBC) multiplied by 100 in both data sets. Transferrin
saturation 45%, serum ferritin >300 ng/ml in men, and ferritin >200
ng/ml in women were considered elevated [18].
Creation of the score in the development data set. Based on its
proposed use as a way to determine whether further laboratory
assessment is necessary, the developed risk score did not include
any laboratory testing and instead focused on an individual's history
and symptoms. The value of the risk score is that it does not require
laboratory tests to increase the suspicion among clinicians that the
patient may have iron overload and require further screening. Follow-
ing that logic, we examined a variety of candidate variables for inclu-
sion in the risk score that can be assessed easily by a clinician. We
chose the list of potential distinguishing predictors based on major
disease entities related to hemochromatosis and iron overload (e.g.,
diabetes, CHF, liver problem), other signs/symptoms that have been
identified from population based studies (e.g., arthritis), and other dis-
ease entities discussed in the literature (e.g., osteoporosis) [5,19,20].
The demographic predictor variables tested were as follows: age in
three categories (20­44, 45­64, and 65 years old), gender, and
race/ethnicity in four categories (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, and other race). The clinical variables tested were
reports of physician diagnosis of arthritis, liver condition, osteoporosis/
brittle bones, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and thyroid disease/
problem. Patient reports of joint pain/aching/stiffness in the past year
were also evaluated.
Because of the complex survey design in the NHANES 1999­2002,
we used SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Park, NC) to perform
logistic regression analyses with study design variables and weights,
which made the results generalizable to the noninstitutionalized U.S.
population. The modeling strategy followed was backward elimination.
Variables not significant at the P < 0.05 level in the first logistic regres-
sion were removed and logistic regression was repeated to confirm
that the slope parameters for variables remaining were still significantly
different from zero. The same variables were identified using both for-
ward selection and backward elimination strategies.
Creation of the iron overload risk score (IRON score) followed the
methods used in the creation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index [21].
Odds ratios for elevated iron calculated during the second logistic
regression were used to assess risk scores. Odds ratios less than 1.3
receive a score of 0. Significant odds ratios in the range of 1.30 to 1.49
receive a score of 1. Significant odds ratios in the range of 1.50 to 2.49
receive a score of 2. Significant odds ratios in the range of 2.50 to 3.49
receive a score of 3, etc. The total IRON score was the sum of the
scores for the individual variables.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were computed
using MedCalc software and the iron overload risk scores for the
NHANES 1999­2002 data set. This analysis used unweighted data, as
there was no provision for weighting of data in MedCalc Area Under the
Curve (AUC) was calculated for the ROC curve. The higher the area
under the curve, the more useful the tool is for screening. An AUC of 1.0
would indicate a perfect relationship and an AUC of 0.50 indicates there
is no relationship. We also computed weighted ROC curves using a SAS
based procedure. However, this strategy does not allow for computation
of sensitivity and specificity values for particular iron-overload risk
scores and does not produce ROC curve graphs [22]. The AUCs calcu-
lated were virtually the same using weighted (0.712) and unweighted
data (0.720) with the NHANES 1999­2002 data.
Testing of the risk score in other samples. We chose to use the
NHANES III data set for validating the risk score. The NHANES III was
conducted between 1988 and 1994. Persons 20­74 years old were
included in our study because the question about liver condition was
not asked of persons 75 years old or older. With the NHANES III, we
used age (20­44, 45­64, and 65­74 years old), gender, liver disorder
caused pain, osteoporosis, and thyroid disease for calculation of the
risk score as these were the variables that were significant after the
first logistic regression. One other difference between the NHANES
1999­2002 questions used to develop the score and the NHANES III
questions used to validate the score was a slight difference in the word-
ing of the question asking of self report of physician diagnosed liver
problems. In the NHANES 1999­2002, the variable was worded as
``liver condition,'' whereas in the NHANES III, the variable was worded
as ``liver disorder caused pain.'' This would suggest that the responses
to the NHANES 1999­2002 could include diagnoses resulting from
asymptomatic testing.
IRON scores were computed for the NHANES III sample. These risk
scores were then evaluated using ROC curves and AUCs calculated
using MedCalc software. These analyses were done using unweighted
data. The AUCs calculated were virtually the same using weighted data
in SAS (0.687) and unweighted data in MedCalc (0.685).
Results
There were 8,779 individuals in the NHANES 1999­2002
sample, representing 186,389,488 persons. Demographics
of these individuals are shown in Table I. There were 101
unweighted cases of individuals with elevated transferrin sat-
uration and elevated ferritin in the NHANES 1999­2002
accounting for 1% of the adult population or 1,928,202 indi-
viduals. Results of the initial logistic regression are presented
in Table II and results of the final logistic regression and cor-
responding IRON scores are shown in Table III. The IRON
score included five variables with a higher score on the IRON
score indicating a greater risk that the patient currently has
iron overload. The variables are age (20­44 5 0; 45­64 5 2;
65 5 3), gender (women 5 0; men 5 6), physician diagno-
sis of liver condition (no 5 0; yes 5 3), physician diagnosis of
osteoporosis (no 5 0; yes 5 3), and physician diagnosis of
thyroid disease/problem (no 5 0; yes 5 3). The individuals'
total scores ranged from 0 to 18. The AUC for the NHANES
1999­2002 ROC curve was 0.720 (Fig. 1). Sensitivity and
specificity of the ROC curves are presented in Table IV.

Based on the results from NHANES 1999­2002, IRON
scores were also computed for NHANES III. The NHANES
III included 13,844 unweighted cases in the sample, of
which 159 had both elevated transferrin saturation and ele-
vated ferritin representing 1% of the adult population or
1,575,404 individuals. Demographics of these individuals
are shown in Table I. The AUC for the NHANES III ROC
curve was 0.685 (Fig. 2).

Discussion
It can be difficult to diagnosis patients with iron overload
when they are in the early stages of the condition because
they typically have nonspecific symptoms such as chronic
fatigue, abdominal pain, or joint pain which may be attrib-
uted to other causes. The diagnosis may not be suspected
even in patients with more severe manifestations such as
liver disease, cardiomyopathy, or diabetes mellitus because
these conditions are common in the general population.
The risk assessment tool that we developed to help physi-
cians identify patients who might have hereditary hemo-
chromatosis may provide an effective strategy for promot-
ing early detection of iron overload and prevention of mor-
bidity and mortality associated with this condition [23].
The IRON score can be used as an assessment tool for
screening in clinical and population settings or as a pre-
screening tool to help identify potential patients that need
to have further laboratory testing to assess their iron meas-
ures. This is the first risk score created to assist in identify-
ing patients at risk for current iron overload without a physi-
cal examination or laboratory assessment. It consists of a
minimal amount of self reported information that could be
collected through either a quick personal history or an elec-
tronic health record.
The IRON score has a predictive utility and AUC values
(AUC 5 0.720 for development data set; 0.685 for valida-
tion data set) similar to tools that help to target screening
for other chronic conditions, such as diabetes and osteopo-
rosis [14,24,25]. Three previously published screening tools
are the TAG-IT (AUC 5 0.740 for development data set;
0.744 for validation data set) which can be used to identify
persons likely to have impaired fasting glucose; the FRAX
tool (validated in 11 clinical trials with AUC 5 0.57­0.77;
mean 5 0.66) used to identify women with at risk for frac-
ture; and the ARIC CHD Risk Calculator (AUC 5 0.721 for
women with diabetes; 0.672 for men with diabetes) for
assessing cardiovascular risk in persons having diabetes
[14,16,24,25]. The use of risk score tools was recom-
mended in the recent scientific statement by the American
Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and
American College of Cardiology Foundation (ADA/AHA/
ACCF) on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular
events in people with diabetes [16]. This approach is con-
sistent with the current recommendations for screening and
preventive treatment for a variety of common conditions by
the United States Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) and other organizations.
Considering the possible morbidity and mortality from un-
identified iron overload, this tool has significant potential for
improving care by allowing clinicians to identify affected
individuals before the onset of significant clinical manifesta-
tions without requiring the resources that would be used if
universal genetic or laboratory screening was recom-
mended. Another benefit is that that instead of calculating
a future risk, it calculates risk of currently having elevated
iron measures which may indicate iron overload. Finally,
this tool has potential application as a Web-based screen-
ing instrument to improve awareness and population health
[26,27]. Further studies to evaluate the cost effectiveness
of the IRON score to identify patients with current iron over-
load are needed.
Although the IRON score has potential utility in a clinical
setting, we should note limitations in its design. First, this
tool was developed from cross-sectional data and examines
only the likelihood of currently having elevated iron meas-
ures. This score does not predict future risk for developing
iron overload or disease sequelae of iron overload. How-
ever, for its suggested purpose of guiding targeted screen-
ing, identifying those currently having elevated iron meas-
ures is most appropriate. However, there is not currently
universal agreement on those levels [18,28]. Second, due
to the data that were available, different questions had to
be used in the developmental data set and validation data
sets to represent risk score components, specifically when
identifying liver issues. NHANES 1999­2002 asked about
liver conditions and NHANES III asked about liver disorder
causing pain. This difference limits the predictive ability
found in the validation data set, as the more inclusive liver
condition question would be expected to perform better
than one asking about pain due to a liver condition, which
will miss individuals who are pain free but have liver dis-
ease. However, we purposefully did not attempt to use lab-
oratory findings to identify liver disease because we wanted
the score to include easily available data. Third, neither the
NHANES III nor the NHANES 1999­2002 included a ques-
tion regarding whether a doctor had ever told the respond-
ent that he or she had hemochromatosis. Consequently, we
could not exclude individuals with diagnosed hemochroma-
tosis from the population. It is likely, however, that most
individuals who were successfully managing their disease
would not still meet our criteria of elevated iron measures.
In conclusion, the IRON score is a tool to assist in identi-
fication of patients with iron overload that has several qual-
ities that make it attractive for use in clinical practice with
an undifferentiated patient population including brevity, eas-
ily collected information, and predictive ability comparable
to other tools that help in directing screening. Future
research may focus on evaluating the utility of the IRON
score tool in practice.
