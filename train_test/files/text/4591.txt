Proximity, pain, and
State punishment

Abstract
This article examines the difficulties of calculating the severity of sentences presented
by differences in individual penal subjects' experiences, a key challenge to proportion-
ality-based justifications of punishment. It explores the basic arguments for and against
recognising subjective experience, before advancing a model of penal severity based
upon the proximity of the pains of punishment to penal State actions. This model could
partially resolve foundational problems in giving criminally just sentences. Whilst we
cannot wholly reconcile penal subjectivism and objectivism, there are still some oppor-
tunities to improve penal policy and sentencing practice by adopting a proximity model
for penal severity.

Introduction
A considerable literature shows that both custodial and non-custodial sanctions are
routinely accompanied by the experience of suffering, arising out of both the penal
State's own interventions, and the wider activity of non-penal State actors (e.g.
Crewe, 2011; Durnescu, 2011; Payne and Gainey, 1998; Sexton, 2015; Sykes, 1958).
The existence of these `pains of punishment' raises the question: to what extent, if
at all, should that pain be considered part of the punishment inflicted, for the
purposes of calculating the severity of a sentence? This issue has produced extended
debates between penal subjectivists, who calculate severity in terms of the pains
experienced by the penal subject (e.g. Bronsteen et al., 2009, 2010; Kolber, 2009a,
2009b); and objectivists, who focus on what deprivations were intended by the

sentencing authority (e.g. Gray, 2010; Haque, 2013: 79­80; Markel and Flanders,
2010; Markel et al., 2011).
This debate has so far been conducted in rather binary terms: one is either
wholly objectivist or subjectivist about the question of what constitutes punish-
ment. This article subjects that binary to critical attention and proposes a limited
synthesis based upon the proximity of the pains of punishment to the intentional
acts of sentencing authorities that would encourage a closer correspondence
between criminal justice and social reality. Although this paper is situated in the
sentencing practice of England and Wales, the model it proposes is abstract and
could be adapted to other jurisdictions.
The article begins by exploring the fundamental challenges facing attempts at
just sentencing for both penal objectivists and subjectivists. It then lays out the
`proximity' model in detail. Lastly, it considers the implications of this model for
both sentencing practice and penal policy.
Sentencing, delimitation, and difference
The orthodox definition of punishment
Subjectivist and objectivist measurements of punishment tend to take subtly dif-
ferent approaches to the task of defining what `punishment' consists of. However,
they start from more or less the same point: the `Flew­Benn­Hart' account, devel-
oped in the late 1950s and early 1960s. On this account, criminal punishment has
five characteristics. It is (a) unpleasant, (b) imposed for conduct that has breached
legal rules, (c) targeted against the individual responsible for that conduct, (d)
imposed intentionally by State agents other than the subject, who are (e) acting
under the authority of the breached law (Benn, 1958; Flew, 1954; Hart, 1960;
McPherson, 1967 compare Feinberg, 1970; Walker, 1991).
From the perspective of measuring how much punishment a particular sentence
involves, two of these five characteristics are seemingly in tension: element (a),
unpleasantness, implies that severity is calculated according to how unpleasant
the subject's actual experience of punishment is; whilst for element (d), intention-
ality, what matters is how much unpleasantness the State's agents objectively
intend. As a result, element (a) is sometimes given as an objectivising compromise,
`normally considered unpleasant' (compare Walker, 1991: 1­3). Rather than rely-
ing on individual experiences, the accepted severity of the punishment is calculated
in terms of how unpleasant something would usually be, determined by sentencing
authorities' experiences, and by the distant perspectives of penal policy-makers
(Haque, 2013: 79­80; Markel and Flanders, 2010).
Ultimately, this definition has proven popular amongst penal theorists and
policy-makers alike (e.g. Duff, 2001; Markel, 2001). It is especially hegemonic at
the level of sentencing, where decisions as to penal severity must necessarily be
made with imperfect knowledge about the penal subject's past and future con-
text (although note Ashworth, 2015: 192­197). Whilst the pains of punishment
236 Punishment & Society 20(2)
may not be completely irrelevant to the calculation of penal severity, in other
words, accepted wisdom posits that we can only do so much to take penal
subjects' circumstances and likely experiences into account at the point of
sentence.
Penal objectivism: The challenge of difference
However, a central problem with this objective approach is that it obscures signifi-
cant variation in the impact of criminal punishment upon different subjects. This
`challenge of differences in impact' (Ryberg, 2010: 74­82) represents a particularly
entrenched difficulty for the measurement of penal severity (e.g. Beccaria, 1764),
especially given the difficulty of achieving `just deserts in an unjust world' (Tonry,
2014: 141; compare Hudson, 1987, 2000). Individuals can be affected very differ-
ently by seemingly equal treatment, as a result of their expectations, prior experi-
ences, and social context. The failure to account for these differences ultimately
results in the entrenchment of differentiated treatment at every stage of the criminal
justice process, which tends to magnify the impact of social injustices, such as
poverty and racial inequalities, through criminal justice interventions (e.g.
Hudson, 1987: 93­129; Wacquant, 2009).
This is a problem of under-definition of what `counts' as punishment. By focuss-
ing entirely upon what the State wants to do, rather than what it does, we implicitly
focus the State's normative obligation to justify its `pain delivery' (Christie, 1982)
on the aims of State actors, rather than on the consequences for individuals and for
society. By measuring punishment only in terms of abstract deprivations of liberty,
we reify it (and its imperfections) as an inevitable and unquestionable aspect of our
society, to be mediated by other social policy interventions, if at all. But that is not
to escape the authoritarian and coercive nature of State punishment. It is only to
hide it behind a screen of reassuring euphemism (Christie, 1982: 13­19; Hudson,
1987: 167; Tonry, 2014: 164­165).
More to the point, the purely objective account of punishment is descriptively
unsatisfying in an era when social research is making the lived experience of social
phenomena evermore accessible. It is increasingly possible to perceive the impacts
of punishment as a subjectively experienced reality as well as a political-philoso-
phical transaction: to supplement the austere, abstract account of `law on the
books' with fine detail about punishment as `something that is done to people
and experienced by people' (Sexton, 2015: 115, original emphasis). If penal object-
ivism was necessary because of the challenges of taking subjective difference into
account at the point of sentence, then advances that social research has made in the
half century since the `Flew-Benn-Hart' definition in detailing those differences are
relevant to the debate. A modern penologist still could not accurately predict the
future experience of a penal subject, but she could at least contribute to recognising
patterns in past empirical experiences to a greater extent. The epistemological
objection to subjectivised measurements of penal severity cannot be ignored, but
it is overblown in the modern era.
Hayes 237
Penal subjectivism: The challenge of delimitation
There are, in short, compelling epistemic and ethical reasons to move away
from a purely objective approach to measuring penal severity. However, a
fully subjective measurement of sentence severity would also be subject to ser-
ious weaknesses. For one, even if social research has made subjective experi-
ences of punishment more accessible to penal decision-makers, the challenges of
accurately and consistently predicting future experiences of punishment remain.
Even if subjectivised punishment is an ideal situation, the complexities of human
life make perfect predictions unrealistic, compelling judges to either monitor
penal subjects constantly for signs of over- or under-punishment (compare
Markel and Flanders, 2010: 982­984), or else to accept that unpredictable fac-
tors cause potentially radical inequalities in penal subjects' experiences of pun-
ishment. Neither possibility would be solve the `challenge of differences in
impact' discussed above.
Moreover, subjectivists would also fall foul of Ryberg's (2010: 82­87) `chal-
lenge of delimitation'. This is, essentially, a problem of over-definition: if the only
criterion for what counts as punishment is the subject's experience of unpleasant-
ness, then it becomes practically impossible to separate unpleasantness that is the
result of the intrusion of the penal State from unpleasantness that is otherwise
extant in the subject's post-conviction life. As a result, accounts of subjective
penal experiences tend to provide catalogues of hardship, and to offer little, if
any basis for comparing the relative severity of particular sentences. That is, they
tell us that punishment is unpleasant, and in what ways, but not how unpleasant,
and as a result of which specific causes. However, to accurately measure penal
severity, which is a prerequisite of ensuring equality before penal law, we need
precisely that capacity for distinguishing punitive pains from non-punitive ones,
in a way that allows for penal experiences to be meaningfully compared (Hayes,
2016).
This is one reason why the objectivising definition of punishment in terms of
what is `normally considered unpleasant' has survived for so long. A purely
subjective account is no better at achieving just sentencing than a purely object-
ive one, and is considerably harder to operationalise. Any account of subject-
ivity is relegated to the formulation of penal policy, which necessarily deals with
macro-social issues in the abstract, rather than (directly) confronting the lived
experience of individuals.
However, this prevents sentencing authorities from dealing with the painful
contexts in which they sentence, and to a certain extent excuses them of ethical
responsibility for imposing them. Epistemologically and ethically, we can do
better than `normally considered unpleasant'. This article provides an overview
of a model attempting to do so, framing penal severity so as to emphasise
subjective experience, whilst still allowing clarity about what punishments con-
sists of.
238 Punishment & Society 20(2)
Modelling the proximity of the pains of punishment to the
penal State
The model I propose conceptualises punishment in terms of pain and categorises
those pains in terms of their proximity to the (penal) State. I should therefore start
by defining these two key concepts.
Pain
The `pains of punishment' are a well-established subject of penological research,
although it is only in the last few decades that a full range of custodial and non-
custodial sentences has been considered in light of them (e.g. Christie, 1982: 9­11;
Crewe, 2011; Durnescu, 2011; Gainey and Payne, 2000; Hayes, 2015; Payne and
Gainey, 1998; Sykes, 1958: 64).
A pain of punishment can therefore be defined (at least for present purposes) as
a personal experience of physical, mental, or emotional suffering by a penal subject,
arising from their punishment by agents of a criminal justice system. That concept of
`arising from' will need to be addressed in the rest of this article, since it cuts to the
heart of the subjectivist/objectivist divide. However, it is important to stress that
this approach views punishment as intrinsically and subjectively unpleasant (com-
pare Matravers, 2016), and something that is only ultimately defined by individual
experience (however much that experience is structured by socio-demographic con-
texts such as gender, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, and sexual orientation).
Moreover, the concept of `pain' needs to be understood as more than a neuro-
logical phenomenon ­ it includes physical agony, mental trauma, and emotional
angst (Christie, 1982: 9­11). However, it is possible to speak of pains varying over
time and to compare them against one another in general terms. The pains of
punishment provide a research intensive but richly detailed metric of punishment's
experienced impact (Hayes, 2016).
It is also important to stress the individuated nature of these pains, which may
well exist alongside positive experiences and penal outcomes. A probationer, for
example, may be happy to participate in unpaid work as part of her order because
she wishes to make reparations for her crime (I am grateful to my anonymous
reviewers for this example). Like Raskolnikov, she is eager to suffer her punishment
and may even look to derive something positive from it. But that does not mean that
she does not suffer (compare Duff, 2001: 116­125). Indeed, exploratory research
suggests that those who are most engaged with community punishments are most
likely to experience particular pains, particularly the shame of their offending and
pains associated with rehabilitative processes themselves (Hayes, 2015: 90­94). Just
because a sentence benefits the offender, it does not follow that it cannot also hurt
them (McNeill, 2011).
One difficulty with using the pains of punishment is that the concept was not
designed for consistent comparisons between subjects. Indeed, most studies to date
Hayes 239
have provided purely subjectivist accounts: detailed overviews of the (harmful)
lived experiences of particular subjects' punishments (e.g. Christie, 1982: 9­11;
Crewe, 2011; Durnescu, 2011; Hayes, 2015; Payne and Gainey, 1998; Sykes,
1958: 64). But these still leave us with the problem of delimitation. Pains can
(and routinely do) arise out of (re)actions to conviction and punishment from
community forces, friends, family, and other departments of State, for instance.
Any use of the pains of punishment to measure penal severity must consider how
much weight (if any) to give these factors in its calculus. This is where a consider-
ation of proximity comes into play.
Proximity
Pain does not exist in a vacuum. Whatever form it might take, it is caused, exa-
cerbated, and ameliorated by specific factors. The interplay of these factors enables
the division of the pains of punishment into a taxonomy based upon the closeness
of their relationship to the intentional actions of the penal State. Specifically, this
model identifies four distinct classes (depicted graphically in Figure 1): direct pains,
which are straightforwardly intended by the State; oblique pains, which can be said
to be indirectly intended by the State, by analogy with criminal law; contextual
pains, which are unintended but still bear a causal connection to the severity of the
penal intervention; and entirely unrelated pains that are only coincidentally extant
in the subject's life during their punishment.
This distribution of pains enables us to revisit the question of which pains
should be taken into account when determining the severity of sentences.
Figure 1. Model of the proximity of pains of punishment to the penal State.
240 Punishment & Society 20(2)
We might take some or all of these groups of pains into account (with the exception
of those which are wholly unrelated to punishment). Although this taxonomy still
provides no immediate means of ranking pains of punishment against one another
(compare `penal impact' in Hayes (2016)), it does enable us to identify certain
groups of pains that are more or less clearly associated with the infliction of pun-
ishment, notwithstanding their lack of (penal State) intentionality.
Before discussing these categories in more detail, I should make two observa-
tions about the model. First, Figure 1 is not (necessarily) to scale. One penal subject
may suffer numerous contextual pains, for instance, and another virtually none.
Second, there is no reason to assume that more direct pains necessarily contribute
more to the severity of individual sentences. Indeed, several pains that are routinely
highlighted as particularly severe by penal subjects, such as the interruption of
family relationships, may be wholly contextual, whereas direct pains, such as lib-
erty deprivation, may be comparatively less severe (Hayes, 2015: 91­98; Sexton,
2015: 125­128).
Overview of the proximity model
Subject to those reservations, I now turn to the four categories of pains in more
detail. Direct pains are relatively straightforward. They are those pains arising from
explicitly intended penal State activities. The obvious examples of this sort of pain
are those associated with the deprivation of liberty. When an authority sentences a
penal subject to a particular punishment, they intend her to lose some of her free-
doms of choice and self-direction, whether through incarceration, or the more
partial restrictions of choice arising out of community penalties (Durnescu, 2011:
534­536; Sykes, 1958: 65­78). These deprivations are explicit components of what
the sentencing authority wants to happen to the penal subject, and so are easy to
identify from either the sentence itself, or the fundamental nature of the modes of
punishment it deploys (compare Duff, 2001: 143­155).
Unrelated pains are equally straightforward: they are unintended by the penal
State (although they may be intended by other branches of government) and are
neither caused nor exacerbated by the conviction and punishment of the penal
subject. Thus, they cannot be said to have any proximity to penal State actions
at all. The example in Figure 1 is personal bereavement. Suppose I am sentenced to
a community order, and thereafter a beloved relative suddenly and unexpectedly
dies. One would expect this to hurt me profoundly, but that suffering could not
reasonably be linked to the acts of the penal State.
However, it is very easy for initially unrelated pains to become affected by State
punishment. Suppose that my relative was terminally ill and my sentence prevented
me from visiting him in his final days. Here, the separation of the pains of my
bereavement from my punishment becomes trickier. To what extent, if at all,
should my personal loss now be considered as part of my punishment's severity?
The two remaining groups of pains, the oblique and the contextual, attempt to
resolve some of these definitional issues. Let us discuss each in turn.
Hayes 241
Oblique intent and the penal State: An analogy with criminal law
Oblique pains are a relatively narrow class of negative outcomes that the State can
be said to indirectly intend. They enable compromise between pure penal object-
ivism and subjectivism, because they engage with empirical experiences, whilst
remaining compatible with the orthodox (Flew­Benn­Hart) definition's `intention-
ality' requirement. It does so via an analogy to the concept of `intention' in English
criminal law.
The definition of `intention' has consistently confounded criminal lawyers,
resulting in a relatively complex definition in the substantive law. To paraphrase
the classic example (see generally Pedain, 2003): I ship cargo on a transatlantic
flight and secretly hide a bomb on board with the aim of destroying the cargo in
order to claim on a lucrative insurance policy I have against it. I have no specific
desire to kill the craft's crew, and whilst I know they will be endangered, I hope that
they survive. My only aim is the destruction of the cargo. However, when the bomb
detonates, it destroys the aircraft, killing everyone on board.
While it is easy to say that I intend the destruction of the cargo when I detonate
the bomb, it is harder to show that I `intend' the aeroplane's crew's deaths.
Nevertheless, the position of English law is that I may be taken to have intended
those deaths, provided that I: (a) accurately foresee the consequence (the death of
the crew) as a `virtual certainty' of my actions; and (b) undertake those actions
anyway (R v Woollin [1999] 1 AC 82).
It is important to recognise that the substantive law's use of the concept of
`intention' is slightly different to that of the orthodox definition of punishment.
The substantive doctrine of oblique intent is a means of deciding whether the
subject is culpable enough to be held criminally responsible. In the penal context,
by contrast, we are asking whether the pains in question are sufficiently proxim-
ate to State agents' intentions to allow us to take them into account when
determining penal severity. But responsibility and severity of impact are not
the same thing: the former does not affect the latter, especially if we accept
that subjective experience is what constitutes penal severity. We must be cautious,
therefore, about taking the legal test out of its conceptual and purposive context,
despite the intuitive appeal of holding the State to the same standards to which it
holds its citizens.
Nevertheless, oblique State intent is a useful heuristic. It allows us to take some
subjective experiences into account when calculating penal severity, without sacrifi-
cing our ability to meaningfully define punishment. Specifically, oblique intent
contains two relatively narrow classes of pains: general and specific oblique pains.
General oblique pains are those which are virtually certain consequences of
criminal conviction and punishment in all cases, but which are not directly intended
by the sentencing judge. A good example would be the diminished employability
that routinely accompanies a criminal conviction. Internationally, criminological
research suggests that convicts will spend an average of two more years than non-
convicted job seekers searching for employment, because of the stigma associated
with the status of being an (ex-)offender (e.g. Graffam et al., 2008). In other words,
242 Punishment & Society 20(2)
all forms of criminal conviction carry an unintended, community-caused effect that
is likely to occur (and cause at least some pain) in almost every case.
Accepting general obliquely intended pains into our analysis of penal severity
should not mean that we must assume that every (jobless) convict will face exactly
24 months of additional job seeking ahead of them. Some penal subjects will face
longer or shorter periods of unemployment, and in any event, each individual will
be pained by that unemployment in different ways and to different extents (com-
pare Kolber, 2009b: 1567­1568). The point is that some account can be made of it
at sentence ­ for instance, via a general reduction in the duration and onerousness
of sentences by policy-makers, calculated with reference to research findings
around the duration and effects of post-conviction joblessness.
This is not really subjectivism, in that it assumes consequences in an individual's
(inherently unpredictable) future on the basis of prior cases. Rather, this category
compromises between subjective and objective viewpoints. It allows us to alter our
understanding of differences in (highly probable) impact over time, as the relation-
ship between conviction and pain-causing factors changes. This would be difficult
and research intensive, undoubtedly, but by no means impossible. The more that
phenomena such as reduced employability are explored (and made accessible to
sentencing authorities) by social research, the easier it will be to accurately predict
the duration and subjective impact of reduced employability in specific cases to a
greater extent than is presently attempted.
By contrast, specific oblique pains are those which are virtually certain to arise in
the particular case of the sentenced person. It is possible to interrogate the subject's
circumstances much more directly here, using, for instance, pre-sentence reports,
which are already a highly influential source of information for Anglo-Welsh sen-
tencing authorities (Nash, 2011).
A good example of specific oblique pains would be those attending upon the
loss of one's home as a result of being imprisoned. These outcomes may be
predictable from information available to the court ­ for instance, where,
under the terms of the penal subject's housing arrangements, conviction results
in automatic eviction. The sentencing authority can be virtually certain of the
consequence, however much it may not desire it. By recognising the virtual cer-
tainty for that person, the possibility of recognising and accounting for the pains
that this outcome is liable to cause opens up at the sentencing stage. Again, the
enquiry into which pains connect to particular consequences of punishment in
particular classes of offenders' contexts can be explored through social research
and its potential to mitigate State punishments set within limits assigned by penal
policy-makers.
Thus, oblique State intention allows us to account for a range of subjective
factors that are relatively constrained, and which, although they tend to originate
outside of the State, are sufficiently proximate to its decision-making that they can
be analysed at the point of sentence. They provide an opportunity to substantially
moderate the painfulness of penal State interventions, by better accounting for the
different circumstances of particular subjects, whether as individuals or as classes.
Hayes 243
However, it should be recognised that they do `objectivise' individual pains to
at least some extent, making them only a partial tool for confronting the challenge
posed by differences in impact to the accurate measurement of penal severity.
Contextual pains and State responsibility: Beyond the analogy with
criminal law
Contextual pains, by contrast, consist of a much wider array of potential causes
and effects. The example in Figure 1 is of the cluster of pains that potentially attend
the interruption of family relationships by punishment. This might be relatively
total, as with the loss of (direct) contact, outside of visitation, that attends impris-
onment (e.g. Crewe, 2011: 511­512). But it might involve suffering arising out of
more indirect interference with the freedom to spend time with parents, children,
spouses, and other family members. Pains of separation, absence from key devel-
opmental moments, or emotionally resonant events can be numerous, chimerical,
and yet deeply significant in terms of their impact upon the penal subject's life
(Hayes, 2015: 94­95; Sexton, 2015: 125). In other words, accounting for these pains
would achieve a greater deal of fidelity to social reality when measuring penal
severity, but doing so would require extremely fine detail on individual convicts'
(predicted) circumstances.
Whilst my analogy with oblique intent was constructed around pains that are (or
could be) foreseen as virtually certain at the point of sentence, contextual pains are
less predictable. They cover a wide variety of actions and reactions by groups
formally unconnected to the penal State, including but not limited to: other
public organisations, such as the welfare State and social services, charities and
other third-sector organisations, private companies, community forces, friends and
family, and indeed penal subjects themselves.
Most significantly, however, these actors cannot influence the sentencing author-
ity, in that they may not be foreseeable, let alone virtually certain, sources of pain
at the point of sentence. However, unlike unrelated pains, contextual pains bear an
indirect connection to the subject's conviction and punishment. Pains that already
existed in the penal subject's life could be affected (positively or negatively) by the
sentence, and new pains may be caused by the reactions of wider social actors to it.
In both cases we can say that, whilst not necessarily foreseen or even foreseeable by
sentencing authorities, these sources of pain are still proximate to the State in that
pains are caused by penal intervention.
I use causation here in a broader sense than the substantive law. Essentially, the
law first identifies a broad range of factors that the outcome could not have
occurred without (R v White [1910] 2 KB 124), before narrowing down those fac-
tors to those which ought to render the relevant actor legally responsible (e.g. R v
Kennedy (No. 2) [2007] UKHL 38, [2008] 1 AC 269; for an influential theorisation
of this approach, see Hart and Honore
´ , 1985: 109­129). But again, we are not
concerned here with the State's responsibility for the pains of punishment.
Rather our focus is the impact that those pains have on that punishment's severity.
244 Punishment & Society 20(2)
In other words, our field of enquiry is broader here than in the legal determination
of guilt, and so a broader definition of causation is appropriate.
However, there is reason for caution when incorporating contextual pains into
the measurement of penal severity. At its most extreme, this category could encom-
pass virtually any suffering experienced over a period starting before, during, or
long after formal punishment is imposed. Moreover, since social experiences are
rarely, if ever, the results of isolated causes, pains are likely to overlap in unpre-
dictable ways. Where one subject might well distinguish between particular pains
(`X hurts, and so does Y'), another may not (`I am in pain'). Arbitrarily separating
out different categories of pains in the latter case risks both researcher bias and the
very ignorance of difference that the model is intended to avoid. In short, distin-
guishing contextual and unrelated pains, and recognising their experienced impact,
requires careful, critical, and work-intensive empirical study.
Despite these difficulties, however, there are compelling reasons to take at least
some account of contextual pains: first, because of the particular need to recognise
the impact of external actors upon the experienced pains of punishment; and second,
because of the general inaccessibility of contextual pains to sentencing authorities.
The role that non-State actors play in criminal justice is inevitably controversial.
The State's monopoly over criminal justice is an entrenched political value in
England and Wales (and in much of the Global West), in part because of that
system's emergence as a means of replacement for destabilising private revenge.
State punishment derives its legitimacy in part from the belief that it has `civilised'
the brutality of feudal retaliation by channelling it through impartial, dispassionate
institutions (e.g. Beccaria, 1764; Elias, 1994; compare Ignatieff, 1981). The intru-
sion of non-State actors is therefore a significant disturbance of the State's trad-
itional role in attributing guilt and punishment.
Moreover, if the State is not a monopolist of punishment, it cannot guarantee
that the suffering it imposes is constrained by any principle of proportionality,
parsimony, or penal minimalism. It is compelled: either to attempt to stop third
parties from paining the penal subject without explicit State permission; or to
accept that it plays only a partial role in punishing the individual, and mediate
its own actions accordingly. All else is a retreat back towards the unsatisfyingly
shallow accounts of pure objectivism.
Even if we might want to achieve something like an abstract liberal vision of the
punished individual in relation to their punishing society, in which punishment is
abstract deprivation of political liberty, under the full control of the State (see, e.g.,
Markel and Flanders, 2010), we need to recognise that it does not describe modern
criminal justice, certainly not in contemporary England and Wales. This is particu-
larly the case in an era marked by a `dispersal of discipline', in which punishment is
increasingly inflicted alongside the subject's everyday life, and where it therefore
interacts with a wide range of social actors who might influence the experienced
pains of punishment (Cohen, 1985). We must recognise the impact that agents
beyond the penal State can have upon punishment's subjective experience, despite
the difficulties, because it is increasingly harder to separate out the penal from the
Hayes 245
wider social experience of the penal subject. If we are to meaningfully evaluate
punishment, we must confront the institution as it is, and not as we would wish it to
be (Tonry, 2014).
A further reason for taking some account of contextual pains is their very
inaccessibility to sentencing authorities, and therefore to formal evaluations of
expected penal severity. By definition, contextual pains are insufficiently foresee-
able to be accounted for accurately in determining likely penal severity. They
cannot be `objectivised' in the way that oblique pains can, since it is much
harder to accurately identify the factors that cause them, both in individual cases
and in general. Thus, a sentencing authority seems compelled either to ignore these
factors (and the differences in impact they may cause), or to make rough estimates
of their likely impact, at a cost to legal certainty.
However, there is another option: penal policy, informed by social research, can
take greater account of contextual pains of punishment. Over time, policy-makers
could build up mechanisms for (a) recognising the factors that affect their inci-
dence, such that they can be foreseen as virtual certainties (transforming contextual
pains into general or specific oblique pains); and (b) reforming guidelines for and
constraints of judicial decision-making, to recognise patterns in penal subjects'
experiences. Both approaches can play a role in providing a wider account of
how specific contextual pains affect the experienced severity of the penal subject's
sentence, without fully surrendering the ability to separate punishment from its
surrounding contexts. A proximity-based account of penal severity can therefore
assist in the development of a more socially accurate criminal justice system that is
more capable of doing justice in context.
The proximity model in penal policy and practice
This overview of the different levels of proximity of the pains of a given punishment
to the penal State has been necessarily brief. It is not intended as a complete or even
partial basis for public policy reform, but more as the first step towards setting a
research (and policy) agenda. However, even this brief sketch enables us to identify
some implications for criminal justice policy and practice. In this final section, I
therefore explore different ways in which penal policy-makers and sentencing
authorities might utilise a proximity model to close the gap between what we
think we do as punishing communities, and what we actually do.
Before doing so, however, it is important to think about the different ways that a
system might approach severity, penal moderation, and the impact of subjective
experience. In particular, one should avoid confusing normative attempts to pre-
scribe how severe a prospective punishment should be with the evaluative, retro-
spective analysis of how severe a particular punishment actually was (compare Duff
and Green, 2011). At the prescriptive level, where sentencing decision-making
occurs, any engagement with subjective experience must tread a very fine line.
First, even allowing for modern improvements of social science's reach and
scope, one can never predict the subjective experience of an individual subject.
246 Punishment & Society 20(2)
The experience of any punishment is unique, coloured by the subject's context,
attitudes, experiences, preconceptions, and surroundings during and after punish-
ment, including but by no means limited to the site/s of the punishment/s imposed
(Liebling, 2004).
Second, using previous experience to construct guidance for prospective judge-
ments about an individual's prescribed experience of penal severity is inherently
fraught with difficulty. Especially when information about subjective experience is
almost exclusively acquired through small-scale qualitative social research projects
(e.g. Durnescu, 2011; Hayes, 2015; Sexton, 2015), there is a danger of overgener-
alisation. For instance, whilst it might be possible to say that the rich suffer a
greater reduction of their living standards in comparison to a poorer person
through imprisonment, it does not follow that all wealthy penal subjects are
affected equally as badly, or that we can precisely map levels on subjective suffering
to net income (Beccaria, 1764: 51­52; Kolber, 2009a: 230­235). If sentencing
authorities are to take the subjective experience of punishment into account
when calculating penal severity, then they require highly tailored guidance that is
as accurate as possible about how and to what extent specific circumstances are
liable to increase or decrease the severity of the sentence.
Without wishing to downplay the difficulty of that task, it can at least be ame-
liorated by the evaluative measurement of penal severity. By examining how
severely punishments have affected the lives of their subjects, one can build up a
picture which is, if not predictive of future outcomes, at least capable of approx-
imating it more closely, increasing the level of fidelity between legal norms and
social experience. Doing so, however, requires an appreciation of the varying abil-
ity of different actors to identify pains in practice.
Who can foresee indirect pains?
Different State agents will necessarily have access to information about some pains
but not others. In particular, contextual pains are defined by the fact that they are
more or less unforeseeable at the point of sentence. Likewise, without access to
specific penal subjects' pre-sentence reports, penal policy-makers (such as the
Ministry of Justice and Sentencing Council in England and Wales) cannot ade-
quately foresee specific oblique pains. An overview of the differentiated foresee-
ability of pains at the sentencing and policy levels is laid out in Table 1.
Table 1. Foreseeability of pains at the sentencing and policy levels
Are pains foreseeable . . . . . . By sentencing authorities? . . . By policy-makers?

General oblique pains Potentially (via policy guidance) Potentially (via research)
Specific oblique pains Yes (via Pre-Sentence Reports) No
Contextual pains No Potentially (via research)
Hayes 247
Any account of all categories within the proximity model, in other words,
requires dialogue between the sentencing and policy levels. Several implications
arise for both sets of decision-makers when using more proximity-based concep-
tions of penal severity. These are discussed below.
Implications for sentencing practice
A proximity-based approach to penal severity need not mean any significant alter-
ation of the role of the judiciary. After all, subjectivism has always been a (limited)
reality of Anglo-Welsh sentencing practice, due to the role played by judicial dis-
cretion and pre-sentence reports (Nash, 2011). Rather, it would mean more formal
recognition of the existing role that these subjective factors play, the protection of
sources of information about them, and a more structured approach to ensuring
that as full a range of pains as possible can be taken into account.
In particular, a proximity model would neither oppose nor support the existing
Anglo-Welsh practice of using aggravating and mitigating factors in Sentencing
Council guidelines to `fine-tune' a sentence after guilt has been determined.
However, it is important to note that the present use of sentencing guidelines,
and particularly of personally mitigating circumstances as they currently stand
(Jacobson and Hough, 2011) can only partially contribute to this process.
In fact, the presently recognised range of personally mitigating factors does not
do much for the intersubjective gauging of penal severity. They provide classes of
contextual factors, leaving the judge with a wide discretion but little guidance as to
how much weight to accord to each. This can allow judges to recognise subjective
differences between subjects (Jacobson and Hough, 2011: 161­162), but formal
guidance is still restricted to observations about classes of people, which, as dis-
cussed above, is a crude measure of difference at best. Present systems of personal
mitigation would at least need to be fine-tuned to deliver proximity-relevant mater-
ial, particularly as regards the weighting of individual factors.
Moreover, the role of aggravation and mitigation in present sentencing guide-
lines focuses heavily upon criminal acts, rather than convicts' circumstances.
Whilst there are many factors that speak to the likely prospective impact of the
order on the penal subject (and third parties), these must wait until after an initial
judgement as to the factors that indicate the harm and culpability for the crime
itself. It is only at this latter point, when the range of potential sentences has been
more or less decisively laid down (Padfield, 2011), that mitigation or aggravation
based on the penal subject's contexts can take place. This limits the ability of
personal mitigation to affect overall penal severity and places more emphasis on
the role of policy-makers in guiding judgements at the sentencing stage.
In short, personal mitigation is not enough by itself to serve as a vehicle for
proximity-based severity judgements. Courts would need to take a more holistic
perspective on sentencing, looking at the subject's conduct in comparison with
the pains that the sentence is likely to inflict on the specific individual in her
unique contexts, insofar as the court is aware of them. Achieving this would not
248 Punishment & Society 20(2)
necessarily require new tools but rather a different approach to how they are used
in practice.
Although that perceptual shift need not require considerable institutional
reform, it would nevertheless profoundly affect sentencing practice. In particular,
one impact of adopting a proximity model of penal severity would be the realign-
ment of judicial attitudes towards alternative punishments to imprisonment. When
approaching punishment as an abstract liberty deprivation, rather than a series of
subjective experiences or `pains of punishment', empirical evidence suggests that it
is easier for judges to aggravate an onerous community penalty into a custodial
sentence than to mitigate imprisonment into a non-custodial sentence (Hough
et al., 2003; Padfield, 2011). However, on a pains-based account, liberty depriv-
ation is only one potential source of punishment. Community-based punishments
are not so much less punitive, therefore, but punitive in different ways, and suited to
different individuals as well as different offences. Recognising the pains of all types
of punishments, and indeed the pains inherent in criminal conviction itself, would
provide one route towards improving the perceived legitimacy of non-custodial
sentences (McNeill, 2011; Robinson et al., 2013).
It is important to remember that the capacity of social scientific advances in the
retrospective recognition of contextual and oblique pains to assist predictive sen-
tencing will always, inevitably, be partial. The objective of the proximity model at
the point of sentence cannot and should not therefore be to set up the judiciary as
prophets, capable of accurately predicting social experiences. To do so would
create a judicial interest in monitoring the precise level of pain experienced by
the penal subject, encouraging the State towards behaviour `dangerously approach-
ing sadism' (Markel and Flanders, 2010: 915). Instead, we should aim to close the
gap between the predictions of penal severity that objectivised sentencing already
makes and the social reality experienced after sentence has been passed. To do so,
however, requires access to retrospective information unavailable to sentencing
authorities. The involvement of penal policy-makers would thus be vital, both to
guide sentencing decisions and to avoid increasingly punitive sentencing practice.
Implications for penal policy
Whilst the implications for sentencing practice are confined more to a change of
perspective than of practices, the transition to a proximity-based account of penal
severity would imply a more significant shift at the level of penal policy. Since penal
policy-makers are able to access research findings on general oblique and context-
ual pains that sentencing authorities cannot consider, the proximity model would
require them to engage with as wide a range of pains as possible, and build them
into existing laws, guidance, and judicial education in a way that enables judges to
pre-empt subjective experiences with greater (virtual) certainty.
Overall, then, the task for penal policy would be to reform the law to better
recognise the impact punishments have when calculating penal severity; to commis-
sion and engage with research to identify the circumstances in which particular
Hayes 249
pains attend certain penal interventions, so that they can be incorporated into
judicial decision-making as oblique pains of punishment; and to address the influ-
ence of external sources of contextual pains in determining penal severity.
This latter task, in particular, is one of deciding which contextual pains are
unavoidable, and which can be minimised through wider policy interventions. It
is one of deciding to what extent it is appropriate (and desirable) for communities
and other external forces to partially determine the experienced severity of punish-
ment. Any recognition of punishment as a social phenomenon implies that the
State must recognise at least some ability of wider social context to affect penal
severity, but beyond that, the precise level of recognition that contextual pains are
an inevitable feature of punishment remains debatable.
This is, if nothing else, an opportunity for further research and refinement of the
proximity model, which has, after all, been presented in a very broad-brush,
abstract manner. Examining which factors affect subjective experience of pains in
general is a good start, but exploring the structuring impact of factors such as age,
ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic class will help to refine and clarify how pain is
currently distributed amongst penal subjects. This will allow us to identify the
distance between what is and what should be (at the level of policy, but also of
political ethics) with more precision, providing targets for more specific and wide-
ranging policy (inside and out of the penal State) in future.
However, it should be noted that concern with fine-tuning penal severity has not
been at the top of the recent penal political-economic agenda of England and
Wales, which has been characterised for much of the last 40 years by a `law and
order arms race' (Lacey, 2008: 173­185). The prospects of a proximity model actu-
ally influencing current penal policy are therefore bleak, and one ought not to
prematurely assume that the present shift away from explicit punitiveness towards
managerialism in penal politics will make it any easier to encourage policy devel-
opments in this direction.
Under these conditions, the researcher must be an advocate for policy consist-
ent with their work, by contributing to public discourses (and therefore, demo-
cratic decision-making) through a robust, honest, and unbiased account of their
findings. In other words, the proximity model is not much use unless any aca-
demic proponents take seriously the public, and inherently political, nature of
social research in democratic societies (Loader and Sparks, 2011; Noaks and
Wincup, 2004: 19­35).
Conclusion: Proximity, pain, and the justice of punishment
The orthodox definition of punishment is a descriptively unsatisfactory account of
contemporary sentencing practice, forced by an historical and ongoing dilemma
between objective clarity and expeditiousness, and subjective detail. It is possible to
at least partially escape this dilemma by providing for at least some acceptance that
the severity of a punishment is constituted by its social experience, that is by the
subjective pains it actually engenders.
250 Punishment & Society 20(2)
We can typify the relationship between pains in terms of their proximity to the
formal State punishment imposed. They may be pains that are directly intended by
the sentencing authority; obliquely intended pains arising from either the general
consequences of conviction or punishment, or the specific known circumstances of
the penal subject; contextual pains that arise out of the multiple contexts of the
punishment in question, which react to and intersect with the penal intervention; or
wholly unrelated pains coincidental to penal processes. All but the latter have a part
to play in measuring penal severity subjectively.
The proximity model is far from a perfect solution to the problem of doing
just deserts in an unjust world, and whilst it is given here in a relatively broad
and abstract form. Nevertheless, it provides a way of thinking about measuring
penal severity that could increase the fidelity between the punishments that the
State believes itself to be imposing in criminal sentences, and the pains actually
experienced as a result. Adopting such an approach would improve the accuracy
of our measurement of penal severity, and so our ability to evaluate the extent
to which criminal justice is done in practice. However, formal adoption of a
proximity-based approach to sentencing would mean concerted shifts in both
sentencing practice and penal policy, which will only be practicable through
academic contribution to public discourse. This, in turn, requires further aca-
demic research into the precise proximities of the pains of punishment to the
imposing State.
