Abstract:
Inflation differentials within European Monetary Union (EMU) are increasingly seen as
exerting adverse effects on the price competitiveness of member countries' firms and ­
given the common monetary policy within EMU ­ as being detrimental to euro-area
economies, in particular to those with relatively high inflation rates. Using three simple
measures of international price competitiveness for EMU countries, the paper analyses
whether these indicators have displayed distinctive trends since the start of EMU and
whether they converge with or diverge from their respective fundamental value. It is
found that all three indicators suggest a gain in competitiveness for the German
economy and a corresponding loss for Italy, Portugal and Spain. Two of the indicators,
however, suggest that these trends reduce former disparities and, thus, contribute to a
convergence of competitiveness within EMU while the third would imply the opposite.

Non technical summary
Inflation differentials within European Monetary Union (EMU) are increasingly seen as
exerting adverse effects on the price competitiveness of member countries' firms and ­
given the common monetary policy within EMU ­ as being detrimental to euro-area
economies, in particular to those with relatively high inflation rates. In order to
determine whether this is really the case, the conventional approach, which merely
looks at cumulated changes in real effective exchange rates as a measure of the
movement in price competitiveness, should be complemented by an equilibrium real
exchange rate concept. On the one hand, inflation differentials within the euro area
could also reflect price level convergence movements, and thus would represent an
innocuous convergence of competitiveness towards a PPP-type equilibrium. On the
other hand, where they can be explained in terms of the productivity approach, inflation
differentials may themselves represent equilibrium phenomena and therefore leave price
competitiveness unchanged.
The paper analyses, in terms of three simple equilibrium concepts of the real exchange
rate ­ relative PPP, absolute PPP and the productivity approach ­ whether the
corresponding indicators of price competitiveness have displayed distinctive trends
since the start of EMU and whether they converge with or diverge from their respective
fundamental value. It is found that all three indicators suggest a gain in price
competitiveness for the German economy and a corresponding loss for Italy, Portugal
and Spain. Two of the indicators suggest that these trends merely reduce former
disparities and thus contribute to a convergence of price competitiveness within EMU.
According to the third, and possibly the most reliable indicator, however, the observed
trends in price competitiveness represent an increasing dispersion from equilibrium and
therefore justify further attention in the economic policy debate.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
In zunehmendem Maße werden Inflationsdifferenzen innerhalb der Europäischen
Währungsunion (EWU) im Zusammenhang mit ihrem Einfluss auf die preisliche
Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Unternehmen in den einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten betrachtet.
Vor dem Hintergrund der gemeinsamen Geldpolitik in der Währungsunion wird
vermutet, dass sie sich insbesondere schädlich auf diejenigen Volkswirtschaften in der
EWU auswirken, die vergleichsweise hohe Inflationsraten aufweisen. Um einschätzen
zu können, ob dies tatsächlich der Fall ist, sollte das übliche Vorgehen, als Maß für die
Entwicklung der preislichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit die kumulierten Änderungen des
realen effektiven Wechselkurses zu verwenden, um ein Gleichgewichtskonzept eines
realen Wechselkurses erweitert werden. Denn zum einen könnten Inflationsdifferenzen
im Euro-Währungsgebiet auch Preisniveaukonvergenz widerspiegeln. Sie wären dann
Ausdruck harmloser Konvergenzbewegungen in Richtung eines Gleichgewichts
entsprechend der Kaufkraftparitätentheorie. Soweit Inflationsdifferenzen im Rahmen
des Produktivitätsansatzes erklärt werden können, könnten sie zum anderen selbst
Gleichgewichtsphänomene sein und damit die preisliche Wettbewerbsfähigkeit
unbeeinflusst lassen.
Die vorliegende Studie analysiert im Rahmen von drei einfachen
Gleichgewichtskonzepten des realen Wechselkurses ­ relative Kaufkraftparitäten-
theorie, absolute Kaufkraftparitätentheorie und Produktivitätsansatz ­, inwiefern
entsprechende Indikatoren der preislichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit seit Beginn der EWU
erkennbare Trends aufweisen und ob im Vergleich zu dem jeweiligen
Gleichgewichtswert eine Konvergenz- oder eine Divergenzentwicklung zu beobachten
ist. Es stellt sich heraus, dass alle drei Indikatoren der deutschen Volkswirtschaft einen
Zuwachs an preislicher Wettbewerbsfähigkeit attestieren und Italien, Portugal sowie
Spanien einen entsprechenden Verlust an Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Zwei der Indikatoren
legen nahe, dass diese Entwicklungen lediglich frühere Disparitäten reduzieren und
insofern zu einer Konvergenz der preislichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit innerhalb der EWU
beitragen. Dem dritten Indikator zufolge, der möglicherweise der verlässlichste ist,
stellen die festgestellten Trends der preislichen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit allerdings
zunehmende Abweichungen vom Gleichgewichtszustand dar und rechtfertigen aus
diesem Grund eine weiterhin hohe Aufmerksamkeit in der wirtschaftspolitischen
Auseinandersetzung.

An assessment of the trends in international price
competitiveness among EMU countries*
1. Introduction: Inflation differentials within EMU and international
price competitiveness
Economic policymakers rarely pay much attention to inflation differentials
between regions that share a common currency. The European Monetary Union (EMU),
however, represents a notable exception to this general observation. The annual
inflation rates of many EMU member countries, measured by the harmonised index of
consumer prices (HICP), have deviated by more than half a percentage point annually
from the EMU average in most years since the introduction of the euro in 1999. In some
cases, the differential to the average exceeded two percentage points (see ECB, 2005b).
At first sight, inflation differentials of this magnitude may not appear to be a matter of
concern. Indeed, the European Central Bank emphasises that, at the start of the nineties,
inflation differentials among current EMU members were much more pronounced and
that they have decreased continuously over the following decade. Moreover, it is shown
that the dispersion of annual inflation in the euro area since 1999 hardly differs from
that of 14 US metropolitan statistical areas for the same period.
The ECB (2003b), however, points out that EMU inflation dispersion is
continuously twice as large as that of corresponding measures for German regions,
Spanish regions or Italian cities. It suggests that larger geographical distances and a
lower degree of policy decentralisation may be the reasons for the higher inflation
dispersion in the United States and the euro area compared with EMU member
countries. As is highlighted in ECB (2005b), there is, however, also a fundamental
difference between inflation differentials within the euro area and those within the

United States. EMU countries' inflation deviations from the euro-area average are much
more persistent than those of US metropolitan statistical areas compared with the US
average. For the first six years of monetary union, a majority of EMU member states
belonged either to the group of countries whose annual inflation rates were continuously
above the EMU average or to the group of countries whose inflation rates were
continuously below.
In the economic policy debate, the major concern associated with persistent
inflation differentials is that firms from high inflation countries may accumulate an
increasing competitive disadvantage compared with their competitors from EMU
partner countries with persistently lower inflation rates. Relatively high rates of
inflation may reflect a rise in the prices of domestic factors that are used in the
production of output which is traded in an internationally competitive environment. If
not offset by a corresponding increase in productivity, domestic competitiveness suffers
inasmuch as the average profitability of domestic firms falls relative to those abroad,
and the trade balance tends ceteris paribus to deteriorate.1 In a monetary union, neither
national monetary policy nor the exchange rate can be used as a policy instrument to
reduce the disparities. The economic adjustment process, therefore, will probably be
slow and painful.
Inflation differentials, however, may be the consequence of creating the common
currency area. After all, EMU founders hoped that the common currency would increase
price transparency across euro-area countries, leading to rising competition and, finally,
to convergence towards a highly competitive price level of internationally tradable
goods (cf European Commission, 1990, p 19, and 1996, p 74 as well as ECB, 2002).
Inflation differentials of this sort, which reflect price convergence movements, should ­
instead of being seen as detrimental ­ rather be classified as being beneficial for all
EMU countries concerned.
1 The relationship between international competitiveness and average profitability is highlighted and
discussed in Corden (1994), pp 267-287. Concerning the usage of the term competitiveness, Krugman
(1996) holds a much more critical view, which is, to be sure, based on models of a frictionless world
without adjustment costs, unemployment or even trade imbalances. His main point, however, to warn
against using the term competitiveness in a mercantilist sense (for example, by considering foreign
output growth or a deterioration in the trade balance as a threat to domestic welfare, or as reflected by
the tendency to react to such developments with the imposition of trade restrictions) is, of course,
worth being emphasized.
3
Studies such as Rogers (2001), Hill (2004), Faber/Stokman (2005) and
Goldberg/Verboven (2005) confirm the existence of price level convergence in Europe
in the 1990s. Their evidence, however, does mainly apply to the period before the
introduction of the euro. Focussing in contrast on price developments in EMU since its
inception, Engel/Rogers (2004) found no evidence of price convergence in an analysis
of Economist Intelligence Unit data, neither in general nor a specific convergence
movement due to the introduction of the euro. Similar results are reported by Lutz
(2004), who investigates four alternative datasets of disaggregated prices. Allington et
al (2005), by contrast, assert that these conclusions were premature and, using a broad
Eurostat dataset, claim to have found robust evidence for price convergence in EMU
which was triggered by the introduction of the euro.
A second reason for qualifying the conventional negative assessment of inflation
differentials within the euro area is the possibility that they might not be associated with
a loss of competitiveness of the high inflation countries' economies. The comparatively
high inflation could have been caused by an asymmetric increase in productivity in the
respective economy and thus represent a (Balassa-Samuelson type) equilibrium
phenomenon. According to the estimations of the German Council of Economic Experts
(2001), pp 267-278, as well as those of Gischer/Weiß (2006), for instance, part of intra-
EMU inflation differentials are due to Balassa-Samuelson effects. Honohan/Lane's
(2003) analysis of 1999-2001 panel data, in contrast, yields the result that during this
period the nominal depreciation of the euro against the US dollar affected national
inflation rates within the euro area heterogeneously, raising inflation especially in those
countries which trade heavily with non-EMU partners. Arnold/Verhoef (2004),
however, demonstrate that their results no longer hold either if lagged inflation is added
as regressor or as soon as the outlier Ireland is eliminated from the panel.
Conventionally, as seen in Table 2 of Lane (2006) and in ECB (2007), the
evolution of price competitiveness within EMU is measured as the cumulative change
in a respective real effective exchange rate which, in a monetary union, boils down to a
weighted average of inflation differentials. While this measure clearly has its merits, the
first part of the discussion so far has shown that movements in such an indicator should
be qualified as long as they are due to price level convergence. They would then
represent a convergence of competitiveness out of a state of disequilibrium in the base
4
period towards a PPP-type equilibrium level. The second part of the discussion stressed
that EMU inflation differentials may, to a degree, themselves represent equilibrium
phenomena which were not detrimental for the competitiveness of the high inflation
economies. Both strands of thought imply that an assessment of trends in price
competitiveness requires a relevant equilibrium concept for the respective real exchange
rate.
The present paper's main contribution consists in the use of three alternative,
simple equilibrium concepts of the real exchange rate to determine for each of the EMU
economies whether its international price competitiveness improved or deteriorated
since monetary union was created in 1999. Focus is especially placed on whether the
computed change in competitiveness represents divergence from the respective
equilibrium and is, therefore, a genuine matter for concern. It is found that, regardless of
the equilibrium concept used, Germany enjoyed a remarkable increase in
competitiveness against its trading partners within the euro area while Italy, Portugal,
Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg lost price competitiveness. Results concerning
competitiveness convergence with (or divergence from) its equilibrium value, however,
turn out to depend decisively on the equilibrium concept used.
Section 2 presents three equilibrium concepts for the real exchange rate and shows
how they will be used to assess the international price competitiveness of an economy.
Results for the three approaches are shown and discussed in section 3. Section 4
concludes the analysis.
2. Three simple concepts of equilibrium exchange rates
For the assessment of euro-area countries' international price competitiveness,
relative purchasing power parity (PPP), absolute PPP and a Balassa (1964) and
Samuelson (1964) type model have been used as alternative equilibrium concepts.
These three concepts have been chosen especially because of their simplicity. More
complex models are not only far more difficult to implement, they may also be
unsuitable to yield measures of competitiveness and equilibrium values that are
comparable across all EMU countries. Moreover, all the approaches used in the present
study benefit from being able to provide a theoretically well-founded equilibrium value
5
which may be much more appealing to policymakers as a normative guideline than, for
instance, the commonly used but rather eclectic BEER approaches (see eg MacDonald,
2000, or Driver/Westaway, 2005). Finally, the equilibrium concepts chosen are
generally seen as providing particularly long-term equilibrium values which may be the
most relevant given that the only adjustment variables in a currency union, relative
prices, move rather slowly.
2.1 Relative PPP
Relative purchasing power parity claims that real exchange rates should be mean
reverting in the long-run. Since the nominal exchange rate is irreversibly fixed in a
monetary union, this implies that the relative price level between the domestic and the
foreign economy should converge to some constant value. In a PPP model, changes in
the real exchange rate indicate changes in competitiveness and, in a monetary union, a
high-inflation economy loses competitiveness. The real exchange rate can thus be used
directly as a competitiveness indicator.
While the relative PPP model thus easily allows an assessment of the direction
and the magnitude of a change in competitiveness, it is more difficult to use to assess
whether such a change represents a convergence movement and, therefore, is desired, or
whether some high-inflation economies accumulate potentially highly persistent
competitive disadvantages. Since, in a relative PPP model, price indices are used to
compute real exchange rates, the calculated relative price level arbitrarily depends on
the normalisation of the index. In other words, the real exchange rate converges to some
mean in a relative PPP model but the model is silent on the value of the mean.
The theoretical gap may, however, be closed empirically. If the relative PPP
hypothesis is confirmed statistically, a long-term average of the real exchange rate
should approximate the mean to which the real exchange rate reverts. The empirical
validity of relative PPP has in fact been such a prominent issue in recent research that
numerous survey studies have been published, for example Froot/Rogoff (1995), Rogoff
(1996), Sarno/Taylor (2002), chapter 3, and Taylor/Taylor (2004). Most surveys
conclude that relative PPP holds in the long run, and even opponents may admit that
relative PPP is at least a comparatively good approximation of reality. The long-term
6
average of a real exchange rate may, therefore, be interpretable as a rough indication of
its equilibrium value.
For the analysis, real effective exchange rates as calculated by the Deutsche
Bundesbank are used because price competitiveness should, of course, be defined
multilaterally, ie against a group of (EMU) partner countries. They are computed as
geometric trade-weighted averages of bilateral rates against all the trading partners in
EMU.2
For the calculation of these competitiveness indicators, different types of price
and cost indices have been used. The appropriateness of different indices in reflecting
price competitiveness of an economy has been discussed inter alia in Deutsche
Bundesbank (1998, 2004) and ECB (2003a, 2005a). According to the Bundesbank
studies, a rather broadly defined price index such as the price deflator of total sales
should be the most suitable since such indicators are the only ones that reflect price
differentials in intermediate inputs that make up a significant part of differences in price
competitiveness. As an alternative to the price deflator of total sales, competitiveness
indicators based on consumer price indices as well as those based on unit labour costs in
the enterprise sector have been used in the present study, bearing in mind that
measurement problems should be much more prevalent in unit labour cost indices than
in price indices.3 The price index-based series span the period 1975:1 ­ 2006:1 at a
quarterly frequency. The cost index-based variables differ by starting in 1976:3.
Bearing in mind the possible limitations of their adequacy as expressed in
Banerjee et al (2004, 2005) and Fischer/Porath (2006), panel unit root tests of the
country panels of real effective exchange rates have been performed. Real exchange
rates are often found to be correlated (cf O'Connell, 1998, for example), a property
which will obviously also pertain to real effective exchange rates which are just
weighted averages of the former. Therefore, it is advisable to apply second generation
panel unit root tests in the sense of Breitung/Pesaran (2005) which take heterogeneous
cross-sectional correlations into account. More specifically, Harvey/Bates' (2002)
2 The computation methodology follows Buldorini et al (2002).
3 According to Deutsche Bundesbank (1998, 2004), the occasionally proposed real effective exchange
rates based on unit labour costs in the manufacturing sector are less suitable as competitiveness
indicators.

 , N is the number of cross-
sectional units in the panel,  is the covariance matrix of the system, and  is the
number of lags used in the pre-whitening procedure. Harvey/Bates (2002) and
Breitung/Das (2005), respectively, provide critical values.
Results are shown in the upper part of Table 1 for panels containing series for
each of the 12 EMU members present since the accession of Greece, N = 12, except in
the case of the real effective exchange rates based on unit labour costs in the enterprise
sector where N = 10 because no data were available for Greece and Luxembourg. There
is strong evidence for the real effective exchange rate based on ULCs to be stationary
and reasonable evidence for CPI-based series. Real effective exchange rates based on
deflators of total sales, however, appear rather to be non-stationary. The mixed and
somewhat inconclusive results adequately reflect the discussion on the validity of
relative PPP in the post-Bretton Woods era, although, in general, panel unit root tests
are often more supportive of relative PPP, O'Connell (1998) being one of the few
exceptions. In spite of the large differences with respect to the panel unit root test results
8
on stationarity, it will be shown that the assessment of competitiveness levels and trends
is hardly affected by the choice of the underlying price or cost index.
Long-term averages of the series have been formed over the entire observation
period and thus cover the required long-term span of data. Deutsche Bundesbank (2004)
finds that a reduction in the length of the period hardly affects the value of the long-term
average of German price competitiveness.
2.2 Absolute PPP
It is common knowledge that it would be very hard to find any empirical evidence
in favour of absolute purchasing power parity. Generally, even developed countries'
real exchange rates show deviations from absolute PPP values that can last for decades.
Such long-run deviations from absolute PPP are usually explained by structural and
institutional impediments to adjustment such as regulations, taxes, transport costs or
tariffs. These factors, however, usually affect the competitiveness of an economy. If
production is expensive because of high real estate prices, decrepit infrastructure, an
insufficient education system or high taxes, then competitiveness is low. Absolute PPP
may, therefore, be seen as a very long-term normative concept. In any case, absolute
PPP is probably the superior macroeconomic concept to investigate whether inflation
differentials in EMU are reflections of price level convergence.
As with relative PPP, the real exchange rate can be used as a competitiveness
indicator. As opposed to relative PPP, absolute PPP requires the real exchange rate to be
calculated with relative price levels. Price indices are insufficient. Relative price levels
can be computed from "purchasing power parities", which are provided by the
European Commission in their annual macro-economic database (AMECO). The term
"purchasing power parity" indicates the amount of national currency which is required
for the purchase of that unit of a basket of goods in the domestic country which costs
one currency unit in the base country. The common basket of goods consists of several
thousand tradable and non-tradable products whose prices are collected by national
statistical institutes. Annual data starting from 1960 are available.

trade weights that have already been used for the computation of real effective exchange
rates in the relative PPP framework, gi,j

relative price level of country i against its 11 euro-area trading partners, Pi,t

A value of Pi,t
larger than 1 implies that the price level in country i is higher than
the trade-weighted average price level of its EMU trading partners if all prices are
expressed in a common currency. This can be interpreted as country i having a
competitive disadvantage in an absolute PPP framework, where long-term equilibrium
would require Pi,t
to be 1.
2.3 The productivity approach
An important advantage of measures of international price competitiveness based
on absolute PPP is that relative price levels allow for an excellent comparability across
countries. They may, however, be criticised as being less relevant if domestic prices of
internationally non-tradable goods can deviate permanently and significantly from those
abroad without triggering adjustment processes. In this context, reference is often made
to the productivity approach which goes back to Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964)
and is usually discussed in a model like that of Froot/Rogoff (1995). Balassa and
Samuelson suggest that the relative price level should be higher in those countries
which display a higher level of productivity. The productivity approach implies that real
exchange rate movements do not necessarily reflect changes in international price
competitiveness because they could have been caused by asymmetric changes in
productivity. Such real exchange rate movements would represent equilibrium
phenomena unrelated to competitiveness issues.
4 Nominal exchange rate movements are relevant for the observation period before the euro was
introduced in 1999.
10
The evidence on Balassa-Samuelson effects in developed countries is mixed (see
eg Canzoneri et al, 1999, or DeLoach, 2001). However, one might suspect that the
successful catch-up process of countries like Ireland or Spain over the past decades may
have resulted in Balassa-Samuelson effects and in corresponding real appreciation
tendencies. If this were the case, theories like absolute or relative PPP, which suggest a
constant equilibrium real exchange rate, would tend to rate the present international
price competitiveness of these countries too low.
Balassa-Samuelson effects can be eliminated by regressing the real exchange rate
on relative productivity. It should be stressed that the purpose of such a regression in the
present context is not to give a comprehensive explanation of inflation differentials in
EMU. Instead, the aim is to adjust the real exchange rates' evolution for movements
which do not represent changes in price competitiveness within the framework of the
productivity approach.
The choice of the productivity variable has been governed by data availability.
Three alternative variables have been considered: nominal GDP per person employed
measured in purchasing power parities, nominal GDP per head of population measured
in purchasing power parities and real GDP per hour worked. The first two measures are
provided by the AMECO database, the third one is available from the Groningen
Growth and Development Centre. Annual observations for 1960-2005 are available
except in the case of GDP per hour, where observations span the 1968-2004 period.
Among the three productivity measures, real GDP per hour may be the closest to the
productivity concept of the theoretical approach. This variable, however, suffers from
being the only one in which 2002 US dollars (instead of purchasing power parities) are
used to convert national values into a common currency. This may negatively affect
international comparability. Productivity series, denoted by X, are normalised on a
common non-EMU base country c which yields measures of relative productivity5
5 The normalisation is associated with an additional benefit: two of the productivity variables are
expressed in terms of nominal GDP in purchasing power parities while the productivity approach
actually requires real values in purchasing power parities. The conversion into purchasing power
parities will not only eliminate possible nominal exchange rate movements but also the effect of
inflation differentials on the productivity measures. Any remaining average inflation across countries
will be cancelled out in the normalisation process.

Note that equation (7) includes fixed time effects but not fixed country effects for
the individual series of the panel. This is not only in line with the numerous cross
section studies on the productivity approach (a cross-section version of (7) had already
been estimated by Balassa, 1964),6 it is also necessary to maintain the relationship
between the relative price level of a country and its relative productivity level.7 The
standard cross-section fixed effects approach could yield results on the effect of
productivity changes on real exchange rate movements but not on the corresponding
levels. The use of time dummies in equation (7), finally, eliminates the effect of
(possibly unrepresentative) individual movements of the base country on the estimation
6 A cross-section version of (7) had already been estimated by Balassa (1964). To be sure, the theoretical
model assumes an increase in total factor productivity in the tradables sector in order to yield the
proposed positive value for  in (7). Nevertheless, empirical studies regularly use measures of
productivity for the total economy since technological progress is assumed to be concentrated in the
tradables sector. In view of the ICT revolution, one might doubt such an assumption. However, with
the technological advances in the ICT sector, its products and services have increasingly become
internationally tradable. Moreover, since the share of capital is obviously lower in the non-tradables
sector,  may even be positive if technological progress is smaller in the tradables sector than in the
non-tradables sector; cf equation (3.7) in Froot/Rogoff (1995).
7 Some institutional conditions, however, may result in deviations of relative price levels from the values
determined by productivity levels even in equilibrium. In the case of EMU countries, this pertains in
particular to the differing value added tax (VAT) rates which affect relative price levels (but not
relative productivity) because the destination principle is applied for intra-euro-area trade. The ensuing
differences in price levels, however, are probably rather small. Anyway, they could be eliminated by
fixed effects only if the VAT rates had been kept constant in all EMU countries over the last three to
five decades, which has clearly not been the case.

results because they should not play any role in the assessment of competitiveness
within the euro area. More generally, the time dummies capture homogeneous cross-
correlations in the panel.
The second line of Table 2 presents estimates of  obtained with a static fixed
time effects approach. The estimated coefficients turn out to be remarkably independent
of the productivity variable used. According to the estimated value of , a relative
productivity level of country i being one percent greater than that of country j is
reflected on average in a 0.55 to 0.59 percent higher value of the relative price level.
The Durbin Watson statistics, however, suggest that the residuals are highly positively
autocorrelated and that the estimated variances of  are not reliable. Nevertheless, if
relative productivity and relative price levels are integrated and cointegrated, the static
estimators are superconsistent and thus valid.
Second-generation panel unit root tests (MHDF test and PCSE test) are used to
check whether the first of these conditions is fulfilled. The lower part of Table 1 shows
that non-stationarity of relative productivity levels can generally not be rejected. For
relative price levels, it is found that test results depend on the choice of the numéraire
country, a result which is typically found in real exchange rates (cf Coakley/Fuertes,
2000, or Papell/Theodoridis, 2001). A set of panel cointegration tests8, however,
generally rejects the null of non-cointegration between relative productivity and relative
price levels at a five percent significance level, regardless of which test statistic, which
numéraire country and which productivity variable is used. The obvious stationarity of
the residuals implies that the rejection of non-stationarity in one of the relative price
level panels must have been erroneous.9 A further implication is the validity of the
statically estimated  coefficients.
In order to corroborate these results, on the one hand, and to obtain valid estimates
of the variances, on the other, equation (7) has been re-estimated in a dynamic setting.
Two alternative panel cointegration estimation methods are used, Pedroni's (1996)
8 The four DF and the ADF panel cointegration test statistics of Kao (1999) have been used as well as
three (tests 2-4 of his Table 1, p 660) of those developed by Pedroni (1999).
9 This could be due to biases which typically arise in real exchange rate series, as suggested by
Fischer/Porath (2006).
13
fully-modified OLS (FMOLS) and the dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimator suggested by
Kao/Chiang (2000). The common cross-section intercept and fixed time effect setting of
the static approach is retained. In the DOLS specification, two leads and two lags are
employed. As might have been expected given the panel cointegration test results, all
the dynamically estimated  coefficients shown in Table 2 deviate only very slightly
(and insignificantly) from those obtained in the static estimation. The t-values imply
that the  coefficients are statistically significant.
The residuals of equation (7) may be interpreted as (logged) deviations of the
relative price level from the value which is fundamentally justified by the corresponding
relative productivity level. Therefore, they are Balassa-Samuelson type competitiveness
indicators. As usual, they are combined into an effective indicator,

3. Results on price competitiveness within the euro area
3.1 Competitiveness according to the concept of relative PPP
Table 3 presents the results obtained by applying the concept of relative PPP.
Columns (2) to (4) are concerned with the accumulated change in competitiveness since
the start of EMU in January 1999. In a PPP framework, such a change in
competitiveness is entirely due to inflation differentials in a monetary union. The
movements of competitiveness based on consumer price indices as shown in column (4)
correspond conceptually more or less with those in the middle column of Lane's (2006)
Table 2 and in ECB (2007).10
Table 3, in line with the observations by the ECB (2005b), corroborates the view
that, in spite of their rather small size in a given year, the persistence of inflation
differentials has led to remarkable changes in competitiveness in the euro area within
10 They refer, however, to a slightly different observation period. Moreover, the ECB's (2007) figures are
not confined to intra-EMU trade partners. Nevertheless, the emerging competitiveness trends are
generally very similar.
14
just seven years, which in some cases can reach double-digit percentage rates. For the
majority of countries, the computed direction of the accumulated change in
competitiveness is robust with respect to the choice of the price or cost index.
It turns out that it is especially Germany which, according to all measures, has
been able to improve significantly on its price competitiveness. According to some
measures, this may also apply to Austria, Finland and France, albeit to a much lower
degree. Price competitiveness in all of the other EMU countries has been deteriorating
more or less. To some degree, this reflects the fact that Germany is the most important
trading partner for most euro-area economies. Thus German competitiveness receives a
high weight in the calculation of their respective real effective exchange rates.11
From columns (5) to (7) it can be seen that today's price competitiveness exceeds
its long-term average especially in Finland and Germany but also in France. Again, only
in a minority of cases, competitiveness measures based on different price or cost indices
display different directions of deviation from the long-term average. Austria, Belgium,
Ireland, and the Netherlands belong to this group of countries.12 Indicators based on the
concept of relative PPP unanimously judge the competitiveness of Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain as rather low.
The fact that countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain, which were catching up
over the past decades, are rated as being rather uncompetitive if a relative PPP measure
11 Similar results are reported in Felettigh et al (2006). Farina (2001) is one of the few economists who
warned against possible persistent inflation differentials within the emerging EMU and its
consequences for national competitiveness developments. Interestingly, however, he predicted high
inflation and a loss in competitiveness for Germany and low inflation and the concomitant
competitiveness gains for EMU's "periphery", eg for Italy.
12 For the Irish economy, the deviation of unit labour cost-based from other indicators of competitiveness
is particularly pronounced. Taking note of the fact that the denominator of unit labour costs is labour
productivity, this is probably due to a severe upward bias in the measurement of Irish labour
productivity, which is identified by Honohan/Walsh (2002). They reveal that the high Irish labour
productivity figures can be traced back to a small number of multinational corporations which
apparently took advantage of low taxes and standard transfer pricing rules to locate " ... a very high
fraction of the enterprise's global profits in Ireland" (Honohan/Walsh, 2002, p 40).
For the Italian economy, Gros (2007) presumes that unit labour cost-based indicators overstate the loss
of competitiveness. He argues that Italian productivity growth has been higher than recorded because
the recent increase in measured Italian employment is largely due to the regularisation of formerly
informal work while Italian output already contained a large allowance for the underground economy.
The change in price-based measures of competitiveness shown in columns (2) and (4), however, is
unaffected by such measurement problems, and one of them displays a loss of Italian
competitiveness which is comparable to the unit labour cost-based figure.
Any mismeasurement of productivity would, of course, also affect indicators of price competitiveness
based on the productivity approach.
15
is applied, may indicate that a long-term average might fail to take sufficient account of
the low price levels which prevailed in these countries in earlier years. This points to the
relevance of the absolute PPP concept and the productivity approach for assessing price
competitiveness.
Turning to the fundamental question of whether the intra-EMU movements in
competitiveness represent a convergence process and thus should not be regarded as
problematic, Table 3 conveys a sobering picture. Apart from Austria, Belgium and the
Netherlands, where the corresponding results are rather mixed, competitiveness of all
countries must be classified as diverging from the equilibrium value provided by
relative PPP. This is illustrated vividly in Figure 1 which depicts the unweighted
coefficient of variation of EMU countries' price competitiveness. Instead of
diminishing, the dispersion of price competitiveness increased obviously from a value
between 0.05 and 0.07 at the end of 1998 to around double the figure in early 2006.
From a long-run perspective, the dispersion of price competitiveness was low at the
start of monetary union and thus the time to introduce the euro appeared well chosen.
Today, on the contrary, competitiveness dispersion is high even for pre-EMU standards.
3.2 Competitiveness according to the concept of absolute PPP
Table 4 displays the results obtained when applying the concept of absolute PPP.
Column (2) reveals a pattern of movements in competitiveness similar to that found
using the concept of relative PPP. Again, it is in particular Germany which has been
able to improve its competitiveness relative to its trading partners since the introduction
of the euro. A group of countries comprising Austria, Belgium, Finland and France has
not been subject of any significant change in competitiveness within this period. All
other EMU countries have suffered from a loss of competitiveness, a tendency which
applies especially to Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal.
Contrary to the quite similar assessment of recent movements in competitiveness,
indicators based on absolute PPP judge the current level of EMU countries'
competitiveness quite differently than indicators based on relative PPP. Column (3) of
Table 4 shows that Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany and Finland have rather low levels
of competitiveness in the sense that relative price levels in these countries are distinctly
higher than in their trading partner countries within the euro area. While the price
16
competitiveness of Austria, Belgium, France and the Netherlands is rather close to its
equilibrium absolute PPP level, Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy still benefit from a
relatively low price level.
It is striking that these countries are exactly those whose current competitiveness
is assessed as being rather unsatisfactory when relative PPP measures are applied. For
the past decades, Greece and Portugal, being typical catch-up countries within the euro
area, have had low price levels which have been increased only slightly by the recent
comparatively modest losses in competitiveness. In Italy and Spain, relative price levels
started rising much earlier, in the late 1970s. This development was reversed, however,
in the first half of the 1990s when both the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta
depreciated significantly in the turmoil of the European ERM I crisis. Although
relatively high inflation started eroding the newly gained competitiveness again, current
relative price levels are still favourable in these countries. As a reflection of these
developments, Germany lost competitiveness when the D-Mark appreciated during the
ERM I crisis, and it has since steadily been regaining lost ground through relatively low
inflation rates.
The opposing results of relative and absolute PPP concepts concerning current
competitiveness of EMU countries also entail an opposing assessment of whether
competitiveness in the euro area is converging or not. Figure 2 shows the dispersion of
EMU countries' price competitiveness based on absolute PPP indicators. As before, the
dispersion is calculated as the coefficient of variation. This variable has obviously been
on a decreasing long-term trend for decades, and it continued on this course after the
start of monetary union, reflecting converging price levels and thus, in an absolute PPP
interpretation, converging competitiveness. The concept of absolute PPP, therefore,
suggests that the inflation differentials in the euro area, in spite of being persistent, are
hardly a reason for concern.
3.3 Competitiveness according to the productivity approach
As is shown in Table 5, results for the competitiveness of EMU countries based
on the productivity approach depend on the productivity variable used in the regression.
The sign of the calculated values, however, is in most cases robust to the choice of the
productivity regressor. Columns (2) to (4) reveal that Germany, Greece, Belgium,
17
Finland and France gained competitiveness since the start of EMU by all productivity
measures, ie these countries' relative price levels fell by more than one would expect
from their increase in productivity. Germany and Greece displayed especially
pronounced improvements. Interestingly, Germany, Belgium, Finland and France are
those countries for which the indicator based on absolute PPP also displayed gains in
competitiveness. Therefore, developments in productivity did not overcompensate the
movements in relative prices except in the case of Greece. A severe loss in
competitiveness is found, in particular, for Italy and Ireland but also for Spain, Portugal
and the Netherlands by some measures. The results are comparable to those obtained
with the concept of relative PPP, except in the cases of Greece, Belgium and
Luxembourg.
According to columns (5) to (7), competitiveness has recently been rather high, at
least by one of the measures, in Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Luxembourg and,
possibly, in Italy and Austria. In these countries, relative price levels are low compared
with at least some of their productivity levels. Germany, Finland, Ireland and, according
to one productivity measure, also Portugal suffer from a rather low competitiveness
defined by posting high relative price levels compared to their productivity levels. Apart
from Luxembourg, where high productivity levels apparently make up for the high
relative prices, and Portugal, where low relative price levels can be accounted for by
low productivity levels, the picture is quite similar to the one that emerges when the
absolute PPP concept is applied, and thus competitiveness levels are distinctly different
in many cases from those obtained with the concept of relative PPP.
These similarities and differences are reflected in the development of dispersion
of EMU countries' price competitiveness based on the productivity approach, as can be
seen from Figure 3. Competitiveness converged in the 1960s, remained more or less
constant in the 1970s and 1980s and has been converging again since the start of the
1990s. Inflation differentials in the euro area would thus be qualified as rather
innocuous in the framework of the productivity approach.
3.4 Discussion
Since they are coefficients of variation, the calculated levels of dispersion can be
compared across concepts. The dispersion based on the concept of relative PPP turns
18
out to be almost continuously lower than the dispersion based on either of the other two
concepts. This may, however, be a quite natural outcome because the procedure of
assigning the role of the equilibrium value to the long-term average of the real effective
exchange rate entails a kind of minimisation of deviations of competitiveness against
EMU trading partners for every EMU country. The use of country-specific fixed effects
in the productivity approach regression would have had a similar effect.
In a comparison of the development of competitiveness dispersion over time,
several similarities between the dispersion measures based on different concepts attract
attention. Up to the start of the 1970s, competitiveness dispersion declined. The turmoil
of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, however, was again associated with
relatively high dispersion rates. The formation of the European Monetary System in the
late 1970s was able, apparently, to soothe dispersion further. According to all measures
of dispersion, competitiveness converged rapidly within today's euro area at the start of
the 1990s. This process, however, was interrupted by the EMS crisis in late 1992. All
measures displayed a local maximum of dispersion in 1995 when the Italian lira, the
Greek drachma and the Spanish peseta depreciated considerably against most of the
other currencies of today's EMU countries. This observation possibly indicates
overshooting phenomena at work. Sharp exchange rate adjustments such as this one and
the one in the 1970s are obviously not associated with a reduction in possible
misalignments but instead with an increasing dispersion from equilibrium rates.
All these similarities between different concepts of equilibrium real exchange
rates contrast starkly with the period since the formation of EMU in January 1999
which is characterised by a steadily increasing dispersion according to relative PPP
measures while both the concept of absolute PPP and the productivity approach
diagnose a decrease in competitiveness dispersion. This raises the issue of which of the
three concepts may be the most plausible.
From a theoretical point of view, the productivity approach, being the most
comprehensive, realistic and elaborate argument, may appear to be the most appealing
of the three equilibrium concepts used. It turns out, however, that this approach yields
rather curious results, while especially results from the concept of relative PPP are
mostly rather intuitive. As an example, Figures 4 shows the development of the price
19
competitiveness of the German economy based on the productivity approach, where
productivity per hour worked is used in the regression. This indicator suggests that
Germany's price competitiveness has continuously been below equilibrium since the
start of the 1970s, ie the German relative price level has been higher than productivity
would justify for more than thirty years. This contrasts starkly with the persistently high
trade surpluses of Germany in (extra and) intra-EMU trade.
Of course, it is not only price competitiveness which determines the trade balance.
Movements in relative demand and non-price competitiveness factors, for instance,
affect the trade balance as well. These factors, however, can hardly explain the
persistence of the discrepancy between the apparent low competitiveness, as indicated
by this particular productivity measure, and the trade surplus of Germany. Similar
inconsistencies can be found for many other countries in the sample. Such
inconsistencies could arise, in principle, if measurement errors biased the calculations.
In the present case, the collection of prices as well as the computation of GDP and of
the total number of man-hours worked could have been affected by measurement errors,
especially as far as international comparability is concerned.
If the total number of man-hours worked were the culprit, however, one would be
left to explain why the two alternative productivity measures (GDP per head of
population and GDP per person employed) that do not use the total number of man-
hours worked yield rather similar results concerning, for instance, the apparent low
competitiveness of the German economy. These two productivity measures, in turn, use
GDP values in purchasing power parities. Honohan (1998), however, claims that using
GDP based on purchasing power parities biases upwards the productivity of poorer
economies. In fact, the productivity approach assesses the competitiveness positions of
the less wealthy EMU countries Greece, Portugal and Spain much more positively than
the concept of relative PPP. The argument is still not particularly convincing because
the highly wealthy Luxembourg economy displays the same pattern and because
absolute PPP yields even more upbeat competitiveness values for Greece, Portugal and
Spain than the productivity approach. This may imply that quality of some sort has not
been adequately taken into consideration in the price variables.
20
According to some observers, the methodological treatment of German unification
may account for the rather implausible results of the productivity approach calculations.
In the early 1990s, West German data were replaced by unified German data which
noticeably reduced productivity but did not affect the relative price level. In order to
check for the effect of German unification, the calculations were reperformed by using
West German productivity for the entire observation period.13 The modified and the
original panel regression results are virtually the same. They deviate, however, in that
the estimated residuals for West Germany after unification decrease markedly. A
competitiveness indicator, constructed from these residuals along the lines described in
section 2.3, assesses recent German competitiveness as being more or less neutral, ie
relative price levels hardly deviate from the estimated equilibrium value. The
corresponding deviations from equilibrium of the other euro-area countries show a 2 to
4 percentage point fall in competitiveness depending on the weight of Germany in their
external trade. From our point of view, however, it is generally questionable whether it
is sensible to still ignore the eastern part of Germany 16 years after reunification.
4. Conclusions
The persistent inflation differentials between countries of the euro area raise
concerns that they may constitute a continuous divergence of competitiveness of EMU
member countries. The present study addresses this issue by using three different
concepts of equilibrium real exchange rates to assess trends in international price
competitiveness among EMU countries. Relative PPP, absolute PPP and the
productivity approach are chosen as equilibrium concepts especially because they are
simple and enable a straightforward comparison between different economies.
It is found that the choice of the equilibrium concept has hardly been affecting the
direction of change of price competitiveness since the start of monetary union in
January 1999. Regardless of the concept used, the analysis reveals that the German
economy was able to improve its price competitiveness compared with the euro-area
trading partners while Italy, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Luxembourg lost
13 A West German series for GDP per hour worked is available up to 1997. More recent observations
have been constructed through extrapolation under the assumption of equal productivity growth in East
and West Germany. This assumption is, of course, debatable.
21
competitiveness to varying degrees. The results concerning the current level of
competitiveness, however, depend heavily on the equilibrium concept used. Relative
PPP, for instance, suggests a relatively high competitiveness of the German economy
and a rather low one for Italy, Greece and Spain. Absolute PPP and the productivity
approach suggest exactly the opposite.
The fact that different concepts assess the development of competitiveness
similarly but the level of competitiveness differently entails a different judgement of
recent developments in the dispersion of competitiveness among EMU countries. While
measures based on relative PPP show a continuous increase in dispersion since the start
of EMU, competitiveness in the euro area converges according to measures based on
absolute PPP or the productivity approach. Compared with pre-EMU standards, current
competitiveness dispersion is very high if judged from a relative PPP point of view but
it is very low in the framework of the two alternative concepts. The differences are all
the more puzzling as the movements of all the dispersion measures, including those
based on relative PPP were broadly similar in pre-EMU times.
In sum, the persistent inflation differentials between current EMU member
countries could be considered rather innocuous when judged from an absolute PPP or
productivity approach perspective. According to these two concepts, inflation
differentials simply reflect price convergence movements which are an intended
consequence of the formation of monetary union and which should level out as soon as
convergence is completed. From a relative PPP perspective, however, intra-euro-area
inflation differentials are a genuine reason for concern because, in this framework, some
euro-area countries accumulate a continuously increasing competitive advantage
compared with their trading partners within EMU. In such a case, the absence of
national monetary policy instruments could make the necessary adjustment process
slow and painful for euro-area economies that suffer from a low competitiveness.
While the productivity approach may be theoretically most appealing, it yields
less plausible results than a relative PPP-based approach. Trade balance movements, for
instance, are much more in line with results based on relative PPP. The use of more
complex equilibrium concepts of the real exchange rate does not appear to be a
particularly promising way to solve the puzzle since complexity would probably reduce
22
international comparability. Instead, the puzzle may have its origin in systematic
measurement errors in the variables used for the calculation of the competitiveness
indicators. A careful investigation of the potential presence of measurement errors,
possibly by using much more disaggregated price data, as well as an in-depth analysis
of the relationship between different measures of competitiveness and the movements in
foreign trade variables may thus be the obvious next steps in the assessment of
competitiveness trends in the euro area.
