Association between serum homocysteine and markers of im-
paired kidney function in adults in the United States.
Background. Circulating homocysteine, a risk factor for car-
diovascular disease (CVD), is often elevated in chronic kidney
disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Little is
known about the risk of elevated homocysteine associated with
less advanced renal insufficiency in the community.
Methods. Serum homocysteine concentration measures
(umol/L) from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 1991­1994 participants who were aged
40 years and fasted 6 hours (1558 men and 1829 women)
were categorized as <9, 9 to 11.9, 12 to 14.9, and 15. Renal
function levels were determined by Modified Diet in Renal Dis-
ease (MDRD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFRest)
(mL/min/1.73 m2) and the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(ACR) (mg/g). Cumulative odds ratios (OR) of exceeding any
given homocysteine cut point were computed by gender, using
ordinal logistic regression. Each model included GFRest (<60,
60 to 90, 90), ACR (<15, 15 to <30, 30), age, race/ethnicity,
red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12
, and dietary vitamin B6
intake as independent variables.
Results. The adjusted ORs for elevated homocysteine risk
were 9 to 11 times greater in adults with the lowest GFRest
levels (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to those with normal
GFRest levels. Association measures for marginal GFRest lev-
els (60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) were weaker but significant. Albu-
minuria (ACR 30 mg/g) was a significant, independent renal
risk factor for elevated homocysteine in men and women (ad-
justed OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.08­2.93, and adjusted OR = 1.83,
95% CI 1.21­2.76, respectively) relative to those with low nor-
mal albumin excretion, but high normal albuminuria (ACR =
15­30 mg/g) was not.
Conclusion. In the general population, renal insufficiency is
strongly associated with an increased risk of elevated circulat-
ing homocysteine, independent of B vitamin status. These re-
sults raise the possibility that elevated homocysteine may be
an important risk factor to explain the heavy burden of CVD
associated with kidney disease.

In the United States mortality rates from cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) have shown a steady and remark-
able decline over the last two decades [1, 2]. This trend,
however, has not extended to patients with renal fail-
ure. The high CVD mortality in end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) patients has shown no tendency to remit, and
remains tenfold to 100-fold greater than expected for
individuals of the same age in the general population
[3]. There is growing evidence that the heavy burden of
CVD for individuals with renal disease begins long be-
fore ESRD is reached [4­6]. Although the high CVD
risk may be partially explained by high rates of conven-
tional cardiovascular risk factors, especially hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and dyslipidemias [7­9], other factors of
particularly high prevalence in the kidney disease pop-
ulation may contribute. Possibilities include alterations
in calcium-phosphate metabolism, high uric acid levels,
activation of vascular inflammatory processes, and el-
evated homocysteine levels. The development of pre-
ventive strategies to reduce CVD risk in kidney disease
patients will depend on clarification of the contribution
of these other factors.
Homocysteine, an established risk factor for
atherothrombotic vascular disease [10­13], is known
to be markedly elevated in ESRD patients and mod-
erately elevated in patients with diagnosed chronic
kidney disease [14­16]. Homocysteine first emerged as
a cardiovascular risk factor from observations in young
people with a deficiency in cystathionine beta-synthase;
this genetic disorder causes very high homocysteine
levels, typically greater than 100 umol/L, and premature
occlusive vascular disease [17]. A rather sizable body of
cross-sectional epidemiologic investigation has extended
these observations to establish a strong association
between cardiovascular disease and more modest
elevations of homocysteine [11].
While the association of kidney disease and elevated
homocysteine is well established in clinical populations,
there are no data that illuminate the degree of the over-
all population risk. To our knowledge only one general
303
304 Francis et al: Serum homocysteine and markers of impaired kidney function
population study has investigated the strength of the
association between markers of diminished renal func-
tion and elevated homocysteine, but that study focused
on elevated homocysteine as a risk factor for albumin-
uria [18]. Several studies have examined the association
between renal function and homocysteine in renal clinic
patients [14, 19], but extrapolation from such samples
to the overall population is uncertain. Therefore, the
present study was performed to assess the strength of
the association between risk of elevated homocysteine
and the presence of diminished kidney function in the
community using data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­
1994). Since elevated homocysteine may also be caused
by inadequate intake or blood concentrations of nutri-
tional co-factors for homocysteine metabolism [20], the
homocysteine-diminished renal function association was
estimated while taking into account measures of folate,
vitamin B12
, and vitamin B6
. This study is the first to doc-
ument the very substantial impact of renal disease on the
United States population risk for elevated homocysteine.
METHODS
Population and sample
The NHANES III was a multistage probability sam-
ple survey of noninstitutionalized civilian residents of the
United States aged 2 months and older conducted dur-
ing the period 1988­1994. A complex sampling design
with oversampling of some groups (e.g., minorities and
the elderly) was used to ensure more precise estimates
of disease conditions. Participants were interviewed at
home and later during a physical examination at a Mo-
bile Examination Center (MEC) where blood and urine
samples were collected for subsequent analyzes. During
the 1991­1994 period (Phase 2), assays of collected blood
from adults 20 years of age and over, included measure-
ment of total homocysteine. This analysis is based on 3587
participants who were at least 40 years of age at the time
of the interview.
Data collection
The interviews of NHANES III participants included
questions that were used to classify persons according to
gender, age, race/ethnicity, risk behavior attributes, med-
ical history, length of fast prior to the MEC examination,
and total nutrient intake from food during the day pre-
ceding the MEC examination. Information on all foods
and beverages consumed for the previous 24-hour time
period was collected using an automated data collection,
coding, and interview system. Translation of foods con-
sumed into dietary nutrient intake values [21] was based
on United States Dietary Association (USDA) food com-
position databases [22]. Total dietary vitamin B6
intake
(in mg), excluding nutritional supplement sources, was
available from the 24-hour dietary recall.
During the MEC examination blood samples were
collected in ethyl acid containing tubes and centrifuged
within 1 hour of collection. Serum was separated, frozen
at -20C for overnight shipment on dry ice to a cen-
tral laboratory and stored at -70C until assayed. An
untimed random sample of urine was collected using
sterile clean-catch methods and urine specimens were
transported overnight on dry ice to a central laboratory
and stored at -20C.
Measurements
Red blood cell folate (in nmol/L) and serum vitamin
B12
(in pmol/L) were measured by using a radioassay
kit (Quantaphase Folate) from Bio-Rad Laboratories
(Hercules, CA, USA). Total homocysteine concentration
in residual serum samples (previously analyzed for folate
and vitamin B12
and refrozen) was quantified (in umol/L)
using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC) and fluorescence detection [23]. Serum
creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic Jaff´
e
reaction [24] using a Hitachi 737 analyzer. Thawed urine
specimens were analyzed by fluorescent immunoassay for
albumin [25] and the modified kinetic method of Jaff´
e for
creatinine using the Beckman Synchron AS/Astra ana-
lyzer [24]. Urine analysis was not performed on visibly
hematuric specimens or on specimens testing positive
for hemoglobin or nitrites using qualitative test strips
(Multistix). Interassay coefficients of variation were 9%
for serum homocysteine; 7% for serum vitamin B12
; 13%
for red blood cell folate; less than 1.5% for serum cre-
atinine; less than 16% and 10%, respectively, for low
(1.0 mg/L) and medium (7 mg/L) urine albumin control
standards; and less than 8%, 2%, and 3%, respectively,
for low (1.0 mg/dL), medium (6 mg/dL), and high (70­
99 mg/dL) urinary creatinine control standards.
For this study the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio (ACR) is reported in milligrams per gram. Estimates
of the glomerular filtration rate (GFRest), expressed in
mL/min/1.73 m2, were calculated as a function of age,
serum creatinine, gender, and race/ethnicity using the
simplified Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
equation [26] where GFRest = 186.3 × (serum creati-
nine)-1·154 × (age)-0·203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.21 if
African American). The value of 0.23 was subtracted
from the reported serum creatinine concentration prior
to use in the formula. This conversion aligns calibration
of the NHANES laboratory with the laboratory used for
the MDRD samples [27]. In two participants GFRest
slightly exceeded 200 and these estimates were truncated
at that level. Creatinine clearance was estimated from
the Cockcroft-Gault formula [28] corrected for body sur-
face area to 1.73 m2 using the height and weight of the
individual.

Statistical analyses
Of 11,509 participants in Phase 2 of NHANES III, 3943
adults 40 years of age and older (n = 1776 men and n =
2167 women) had data on serum homocysteine, serum
creatinine, urinary albumin and urinary creatinine mea-
sures. After sequential exclusion of adults who had eaten
within 6 hours of the MEC examination (n = 218 men
and n = 268 women) and women who were pregnant
and/or concurrently menstruating (n = 70), the data from
1558 men and 1829 women were available for analysis.
Mean fasting times (±standard error) were 11.3 hours
(0.18) in men and 11.2 hours (0.12) in women. National
estimates of measures of association between physiologic
variables can be obtained from these data by incorporat-
ing sample weights reflecting different probabilities of
selection and differential nonresponse patterns for var-
ious subgroups in the United States civilian noninstitu-
tionalized population. All analyzes were performed using
SUDAAN [29] and incorporated sampling weights and
adjustments for complex survey design, unless otherwise
stated.
The study outcome was serum homocysteine level,
which we classified into four categories (<9, 9 to <12, 12
to <15, and 15 umol/L) based on literature citations [15,
30­33]. The main analysis variables were urinary ACR,
categorized as <15, 15 to 30, and 30 mg/g, and GFRest,
categorized as <60, 60 to <90, and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Estimates of the elevated homocysteine-diminished renal
function association were computed from cumulative (or
proportional odds) logistic regression models [34], and
produced association measures that represent the cumu-
lative odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI. In these models,
the categorical homocysteine value was the dependent
variable and the independent variables were the categor-
ical markers of diminished renal function (i.e., ACR and
GFRest), B vitamin status and demographic attributes.
Categories for red blood cell folate (<305 or 305 nmol)
were chosen to reflect the minimum levels considered to
be clinically adequate [35]. Similar recommendations [36]
were the basis for categorizing dietary vitamin B6
intake
(<1.3 mg/day or 1.3 mg/day if 50 years of age or less;
<1.5 mg/day or 1.5 mg/day if male and >50 years of
age; <1.7 mg/day or 1.7 mg/day if female and >50 years
of age). Serum vitamin B12
levels were based on gender-
specific median concentration [37]. Race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other) and age in years were included as demographic
covariates. Conceptually, cumulative logistic regression
modeling is analogous to fitting in this case three parallel
logistic regression models with a common odds ratio for
the GFRest, ACR, race/ethnicity, age, and B vitamin sta-
tus parameters at each homocysteine threshold while still
incorporating the ordinal nature of homocysteine thresh-
olds. The resulting data can be interpreted in terms of the
odds of a randomly selected person exceeding versus not
exceeding a particular homocysteine cut point in compar-
ison with a randomly selected reference person.
Prevalence of elevated homocysteine in each gender
group, as well as, means, medians, and percentiles for
continuous variables were estimated using appropriate
sample weights. Similar statistics for continuous vari-
ables in men and women stratified by homocysteine cate-
gorywerealsocalculated. Genderdifferencesweretested
using the z test. Tests for trends were performed for
the continuous variables and were based on the signif-
icance of the linear regression coefficient relating the
variable in its continuous form to the categorical level
of serum homocysteine. Multivariate models were fitted
using PROC MULTILOG. Separate cumulative logistic
regression models were estimated for each sex. If not oth-
erwise noted, statistical significance refers to P < 0.05.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
Characteristics of men and women residents of the
United States who were 40 years of age and older are
shown in Table 1. Men were slightly younger on average
than women (56 years vs. 58 years) and tended to have
significantly higher mean homocysteine levels (11.4 vs.
9.8 umol/L) (P < 0.001) along with lower B vitamin sta-
tus measures compared to women. No gender differences
were observed between mean urinary ACR measures or
between mean GFRest levels.
The shape of the relative frequency distribution of ho-
mocysteine (Fig. 1) was similar in men and women, al-
though in men the median and higher percentiles were
about 10% greater than the comparable percentiles in
women. Dispersion of GFRest values about their mean
value(Fig.2)wasslightlylessinmenthaninwomen,while
the overall shapes of the distributions suggest fairly sym-
metric curves that have been truncated in the right tail.
In contrast, the distributions of urinary ACR (Fig. 3) are
markedly skewed, with extremely long right tails that re-
flect the 10.7% (+/- 1.20) of men and 11.8% (+/-1.20)
of women with ACR 30 mg/g.
Univariate analysis
Prevalenceofhomocysteineconcentration15umol/L
was 10.6% (+/- 0.83) in the total population. The propor-
tion of adults with homocysteine concentrations 9, 12,
and 15 umol/L was consistently higher in men than in
women (Fig. 4), although the gender difference for homo-
cysteine 15 umol/L was not statistically significant. The
percent of adults with albuminuria (ACR 30 mg/g) and
the percent with impaired overall renal function (GFRest

for each gender and marker). On the other hand, the pat-
tern for mean GFRest and mean ACR (Fig. 6) reflect
moderately decreasing GFRest means across the range
of homocysteine categories (trend test P < 0.001 for each
gender) and dramatic increases in mean ACR across the
range of homocysteine categories with evidence of cur-
vature in the relation (trend test P = .031 in women; P =
.010 in men).
Mean age was higher in each successive homocysteine
category (Fig. 6) and the observed pattern of decreasing
mean B vitamin measures from the lowest to the high-
est categorical homocysteine level (Fig. 6) was consistent
with expectations (trend tests for mean age, mean red
blood cell folate, mean serum vitamin B12
, and mean vi-

intake P < 0.0001 in women; P < 0.001 in men).
Multivariate analysis
Table 2 displays the cumulative odds ratio for ele-
vated homocysteine (i.e., 9 umol/L or 12 umol/L or
15 umol/L) associated with markers of renal function
impairment, age, race/ethnicity and B vitamin status lev-
els. The adjusted ORs for elevated homocysteine were
significantlygreaterinthosewithmoderate-to-severeloss
of renal function (GFRest <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) relative
to those with normal function in men (OR = 11.1; 95%
CI 5.67­21.6) and women (OR = 9.1; 95% CI 5.77­14.2).
Therewerealsostrongindependentassociationsbetween
risk of elevated homocysteine and diminished renal func-
tion (ACR 30 mg/g and GFR = 60­90 mL/min/1.73 m2),
in both men and women. The adjusted OR for el-
evated homocysteine in men with albuminuria com-
pared to those with low normal albumin excretion (ACR
<15 mg/g) was 1.78 (95% CI 1.08­2.93) and the corre-
sponding OR in women was 1.83 (95% CI 1.21­2.76).
Among adults with mildly reduced GFR (GFRest = 60­
90 mL/min/1.73 m2) the adjusted OR for elevated ho-
mocysteine in men and women were, respectively, 1.57
(95% CI 1.09­2.25) and 2.16 (95% CI 1.58­2.96), com-
pared to those with normal GFR function. Further anal-
yses excluding adults who had macroalbuminuria (ACR
300 mg/g) did not materially change any of these results
(data not presented).
Elevated homocysteine risk was also strongly asso-
ciated with deficient folate levels, below median vita-
min B12
concentrations and inadequate dietary intake
of vitamin B6
, independently of age, race/ethnicity, and
renal function markers. In women Mexican American
race/ethnicity was inversely associated with prevalent el-
evated homocysteine (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.55­0.99),
after controlling for all confounding variables.
A secondary analysis was performed that substituted
categorized levels of creatinine clearance, assessed using
the Cockcroft-Gault equation, for MDRD GFRest in the
models, while retaining albuminuria, age, race/ethnicity,
and B vitamin status measures as independent vari-
ables. The adjusted OR for elevated homocysteine
associated with the lowest creatinine clearance level
(50 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to normal creatinine
clearance (>80 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 9.1 (95% CI 3.74­
22.44) in men and 2.88 (95% CI 1.64­5.05) in women.
There was no significant risk of elevated homocysteine as-
sociated with marginally subnormal creatinine clearance
levels (51 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to normal cre-
atinine clearance levels in men (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 0.83­
2.09) or in women (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.81­1.73). Yet,
the strength of the association between elevated homo-
cysteine and albuminuria, adjusted for creatinine clear-
ance, age, race/ethnicity, and B vitamin status, was not
materially changed compared to results obtained using
MDRD GFRest. Similarly, the multivariate-adjusted as-
sociation measures for age, race/ethnicity categories and
categories of B vitamin cofactors were not attenuated. In-
terpretation of these ancillary observations is difficult be-
cause endogenous 24-hour creatinine, which is predicted

DISCUSSION
This study provides the first assessment of the risk fac-
tors for elevated homocysteine in a large representative
sample of the United States population. The findings con-
firm several associations noted previously in population
studies: homocysteine levels were higher in men than
women [38], increased with age [39, 40] and were higher
in individuals with lower red blood cell folate, or lower
serum vitamin B12
or a dietary intake of vitamin B6
below
recommended levels [41, 42].
As in most other epidemiologic investigations, we re-
lied on estimation of GFRs. We used the simplified
MDRD prediction equation that has been validated in
United States adults with established chronic renal dis-
ease [26]. Observations on the ACR in untimed urine
specimens were used since measures of albumin in a 24-
hour urine collection were not available [43]. An ACR
30 mg/g in random urine specimens has consistently
been shown to have good reliability for detecting 24-hour
urinary albumin excretion of 30 mg/L or more [44, 45]. We
excluded from the analysis persons who had not fasted for
at least 6 hours to reduce elevations in physiologic mea-
sures that can be caused by recent intake of a protein
rich meal [46­48]; however, as a consequence, persons
with insulin-dependent diabetes who were not required
tofastundertheNHANESIIIprotocolwerenotincluded
in the analysis.
The most important finding in this study is the steep
gradient in risk of elevated homocysteine associated with
GFR in this general population. The odds of an elevated
homocysteine level, adjusted for age, race, and vitamin
levels, was increased approximately twofold for people
with an estimated GFR of 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, but
was elevated tenfold in individuals with estimated GFR

less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (both compared to those
with estimated GFR greater than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2).
This reflects, in part, the fact that the prevalence of re-
nal disease in the United States population of individu-
als with fasting homocysteine 15 umol/L was very high.
Among this group, which represents approximately 10%
of United States adults 40 years or older, 35% of women
and 20% of men had GFRest under 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
These findings are consistent with observations in sam-
ples of chronic kidney disease patients [14, 49], but our
study is the first to provide data from a substantial sam-
ple of individuals with near normal renal function, and
the first to provide association measures for the civilian
noninstitutionalized United States population.
The importance of these findings derives from the pos-
sibility that elevation of homocysteine may play a causal
role in enhanced CVD risk. There are several possible
biologic mechanisms whereby an elevated homocysteine
level might exert a deleterious effect on vascular func-
tion. Homocysteine may have prooxidant effects [50, 51],
it can diminish nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation [52],
and it may promote thrombosis or impede fibrinolysis
[50, 53]. Less frequently discussed is the possibility that
elevated homocysteine may also diminish adenosine for-
mation [54], adenosine being an important cardiac va-
sodilator as well as a vasoconstrictor in the renal vascular
bed [55].

There are some data from human studies supporting
the hypothesis of direct adverse effects of homocysteine
on the vasculature. Homocysteine lowering appears to
be of value in reducing vascular events in patients with
cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency [17], but these ob-
servations may not be able to be extrapolated to the gen-
eral population since homocysteine levels are very much
higher in patients with this disease than encountered in
the general population. In a recent small randomized clin-
ical trial that addressed the impact of lowering homocys-
teine on risk of coronary restenosis after percutaneous

angioplasty, the authors found that administration of folic
acid and vitamin B6
and vitamin B12
reduced homocys-
teine levels on average from 11.1 ± 4.3 lmol/L to 7.2 ±
2.4 lmol/L and significantly improved both restenosis
rates and the need for revascularization [56]. In the renal
diseasepopulation,arecentplacebo-controlledcrossover
trial in children with chronic renal failure found that
reduction in homocysteine from 10.3 ± 4.2 lmol/L to
8.6 ± 2.3 lmol/L improved endothelial function [57],
although an earlier study in peritoneal dialysis patients
failed to document benefit [58].
There are currently several on-going large random-
ized trials in high risk populations addressing the impact
of homocysteine lowering on actual CVD events [59],
the critical test of the proposal that lowering homocys-
teine will be a valuable preventive strategy. One of these,
the FAVORIT trial, addresses the impact of homocys-
teine lowering in a renal disease population. This study
[60], which recently began recruitment, will examine the
impact on cardiovascular event rate of folate, vitamin
B12
and vitamin B6
supplementation in renal transplant
recipients. This study is being undertaken in the trans-
plant population because preliminary observations es-
tablished that vitamin supplementation in this population
was effective at reducing homocysteine levels [61, 62]. A
number of observations suggest that in the dialysis popu-
lation homocysteine is relatively resistant to vitamin sup-
plementation [63, 64]. Interestingly, however, nocturnal
dialysis has recently been shown to produce large reduc-
tions in homocysteine levels [65].
Our study may also help clarify a controversy in the lit-
erature about the impact of increased albumin excretion
rate on the risk of elevated homocysteine. Findings from
previous studies of the association between albuminuria
and homocysteine have been equivocal; some investiga-
tors have concluded that the association was due to an
association of albuminuria with GFR [19, 66] while oth-
ers have concluded that the association was independent
of GFR [67, 68]. Our study differs from previous anal-
yses in that we were able to assess the strength of the
association in a larger sample of individuals with modest
elevations in albumin excretion rate. Approximately 500
subjects from our total sample of over 3000 individuals
had an ACR of 30 mg/g or greater. For this subpopulation,
the cumulative OR of an abnormal homocysteine level
was increased 1.8-fold, after adjustment for demographic
variables, estimated GFR and B vitamin status level. This
increase in risk was highly significant. Nonetheless, it
was quantitatively much less than the approximately ten-
fold increase in risk we found for subjects with a GFR
of under 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The difference in relative
risk may explain why in smaller samples GFR would
emerge as the dominant determinant of homocysteine
levels.

We had relatively few subjects in our sample with overt
proteinuria. Our results are, therefore, not inconsistent
with the observations from the IDNT study, a large clin-
ical trial in subjects with established diabetic nephropa-
thy, that overt proteinuria is not independently associated
with elevated homocysteine, and the conclusion that in
this condition, a low GFR is the main determinant of ho-
mocysteine levels [19].
The direction of any causal connections between high
homocysteine and low GFR or elevated ACR has been
actively debated [32, 69], and these issues cannot be re-
solved by cross-sectional studies like this one. It appears
likely from a number of observations that reduced re-
nal function, reflected in a low GFR, is causal for ele-
vations of homocysteine, although the mechanism prob-
ably does not reflect a simple relationship with urinary
clearance [70, 71]. Whether causal relationships underlie
the association with albuminuria is less clear and is an
issue that will be most effectively clarified by prospec-
tive evaluation of subjects with and without elevated
homocysteine.
Several study design and methodologic issues must be
addressed when considering the general applicability of
our results. The study group was limited to individuals
aged 40 years and older because the main risk factor of in-
terest, impaired renal function, is known to be associated
with aging and more uncommon in younger adults. Also,
the exclusion of younger adults created an age distribu-
tion for this study that closely corresponded to the age
range of persons examined in previous studies of homo-
cysteineconcentrationanditscorrelatesorpredictors[19,
66­68]. In contrast to measures of folate and vitamin B12
status, the vitamin B6
measure in our study represented
dietary intake determined from a 24-hour recall of food
consumption and does not necessarily reflect concentra-
tions in cells or fluid. Means of physiologic measures
presented here may not correspond to other published
statistics for this age group of NHANES III participants
due to use of different inclusion criteria, as well as estima-
tion methods. In particular, many epidemiologic studies
that examine homocysteine concentration measures re-
port the geometric mean, which is always smaller than an
arithmetic mean of the same data set.
We relied on the MDRD prediction equation to as-
sess GFR. There are no reliability data on the perfor-
mance of this method in a general population. However,
the MDRD equation was devised as a prediction equa-
tion for GFR and validated as an estimation method for
the population with reduced renal function. Most of our
results were confirmed in a secondary analysis that substi-
tuted values from the Cockcroft-Gault equation in place
of MDRD predicted GFR. We still found significantly
Francis et al: Serum homocysteine and markers of impaired kidney function 311
increased risk of elevated homocysteine associated with
albuminuria and with low Cockcroft-Gault renal func-
tion, although the risk in women with low Cockcroft-
Gault renal function was diminished. But findings for
moderately reduced renal function levels conflicted;
whereas elevated homocysteine risk achieved signifi-
cance in the MDRD-based analysis it did not in the
Cockcroft-Gault­based analysis. This difference proba-
bly reflects differences between the compositions of the
groupsidentifiedbythetwomethods;ithasbeenreported
that the Cockcroft-Gault equation tends to overestimate
low values and to underestimate normal to high values of
directly measured GFR [72].
Ourchoiceofacumulativelogisticregressionmodelre-
flected our primary emphasis on estimating the strength
of the homocysteine-renal function impairment associ-
ation and we included in our model only those factors
proven or presumed to be confounding factors for ho-
mocysteine metabolism. This criterion meant that we did
not include in the analysis a number of other variables,
such as alcohol intake, smoking, and serum albumin, po-
tentially associated with homocysteine, and potentially
of interest in other circumstances. The observed risk esti-
mates represent a summary measure of the adjusted ORs
for each definition of elevated homocysteine considered
in the analysis (i.e., 9 umol/L versus <9, 12 umol/L
versus <12, 15 umol/L versus <15). Although cumu-
lative logistic regression models can be used as a basis
for describing the reality of complex relations between
variables of interest or for investigating mechanisms that
might explain the relation, such analyses were superflu-
ous to the goals of the present study. These constraints
should be considered when interpreting our findings.
CONCLUSION
We find a strong association between markers of early
diminished renal function and risk of elevated homocys-
teine, independent of B vitamin status and age. Elevated
homocysteine is therefore, an important candidate risk
factor to account for the increased CVD risk in patients
with chronic renal insufficiency, and an appealing one
since it is potentially a risk factor that could be reduced
cost effectively. Should the current randomized trials of
homocysteine reduction establish the benefit of this in-
tervention, the implications for reducing CVD risk are
substantial.
