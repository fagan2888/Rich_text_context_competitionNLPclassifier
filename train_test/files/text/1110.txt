Social Interactions in Adolescent Television Viewing
Jason Fletcher, MS
Objective: To examine whether social interactions in-
fluence the television viewing choices of adolescents in
grades 7 through 12.
Design: Data from a nationally representative cross-
sectional survey were used to examine the association be-
tween individual-level and school-level television choices.
An instrumental variables approach was used to solve the
simultaneity problem found in models that examine the
association between individual and aggregate choices.
Setting: In-home interviews in the United States col-
lected in 1996.
Participants: A sample of 4532 students in grades 7
through 12 in 132 US public and private schools who par-
ticipated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health (Add Health).
Main Exposure: The reported television viewing choices
of an individual's schoolmates.
Main Outcome Measure: The number of hours of tele-
vision individuals reported viewing in a week.
Results: The number of hours of television that adoles-
cents report viewing per week was associated with their
peers' reported hours of television viewing. Adjusted for
other covariates, a 1-hour increase in average school-
level television viewing was associated with an increase
in almost half an hour of television viewing at the indi-
vidual level.
Conclusions: Evidence suggests that social interac-
tions within schools influence the hours of television that
adolescents report viewing. This finding is important for
both future attempts at modeling the determinants of ado-
lescent television viewing and suggestions for future policy
interventions. The presence of social interactions im-
plies that interventions that affect the social norms of tele-
vision viewing within schools could also change indi-
vidual television viewing. In reducing the number of hours
of television watched, these interventions could also posi-
tively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and
academic achievement.

TELEVISION IS A UBIQUITOUS
part of adolescents' lives,
and its effects are contro-
versial. Many studies have
reported several negative
consequences of television viewing, in-
cluding increases in obesity, attentional
problems and aggression, and decreases in
several measures of academic achieve-
ment.1-4 In contrast, other studies have
shown that some types of programming are
associated with positive developmental
outcomes.5 There have also been several
randomized interventions aimed at reduc-
ing television as a means of decreasing
negative outcomes.3,6 This article exam-
ines the importance of social interactions
in adolescent television choices. Social in-
teractions follow the conceptual idea of the
establishment of a social norm of televi-
sion viewing within peer groups. The idea
of interdependent choices, or social inter-
actions, across individuals, where indi-
vidual choices are affected by the choices
of peers, is becoming established in the
social sciences as an important aspect of
individual decision making. Current re-
search examines potential social interac-
tions in crime, school attendance, and un-
employment.7-9 For example, a student
might choose to attend school on a par-
ticular day based on whether his or her
friends will attend school. The intuitive
reason for this interdependence in choices
is that friends want to be involved in ac-
tivities together whether the activities are
pleasant (eg, skipping school to go to the
mall) or unpleasant (eg, attending school).
This study tested whether social norms
created by schoolmates influence indi-
vidual choices in television viewing. In ad-
dition to contributing to conceptual mod-
els of the determinants of television
viewing among adolescents, the results of

this study can be used to inform policies that seek to
change television viewing choices. Evidence of social in-
teractions suggests several new directions for potential
interventions. If social norms are an important determi-
nant of individual television viewing, interventions that
seek to shape these norms within schools could be a valu-
able future direction for research. Some forms of social
interactions also imply that interventions on a subset of
individuals within a school will have a spillover effect on
students who did not receive the intervention. Both im-
plications of finding social interactions in television view-
ing choices represent new and interesting directions for
future policy suggestions.
METHODS
DATA
Data for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health is a na-
tionally representative study of adolescents in grades 7 through
12andtheiroutcomesinyoungadulthood,andwasbegunin1994
under a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Hu-
man Development, with co-funding from 17 other federal agen-
cies. Data at the individual, family, school, and community lev-
els were collected in 2 waves between 1994 and 1996. More
information about the Add Health data are provided else-
where.10,11 The sample used in this study consists of all adoles-
cents in grades 7 through 12 in the wave II public-use data col-
lectedin1996.Ofthe4532observationsavailableinwaveII,3594
adolescents have valid school identification codes, which are nec-
essary to calculate school-level variables and place individuals in
their school environments. The sample of students with valid
school identification codes is similar to those students with miss-
ing codes across many of the covariates examined in this study,
but they are slightly more likely to be white (0.72 vs 0.68) and
have married parents (0.65 vs 0.54), less likely to be male (0.46
vs 0.55), and on average have a higher family income ($48 300
vs $43 500). Of the remaining sample, 3583 had valid television
hours data and 3141 had complete covariate data after family in-
come was imputed using single imputation techniques for 600
individuals. The use of this data set was preapproved by the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board, Madison.
MEASURES
Outcome Variables
The primary outcome measure was self-reported hours of tele-
vision viewing per week at the individual level.
Independent Variables
The primary predictor of interest was the mean reported hours
of television viewing of an individual's school. For each indi-
vidual, this measure was the sample average of all individuals
in the same school (except the individual). Several important
covariates were also included in the analysis. The individual's
sex was included because it is well documented that male stu-
dents watch more television than female students do.12 Like-
wise, race (white, black, or Hispanic) was included to capture
known differences in television viewing across these groups.13
Overweight status was included because it has consistently been
shown to be highly correlated with television viewing.1,13 An
individual's grade in school and grade point average were in-
cluded because television viewing decreases as students age and
academic achievement is likely to be negatively correlated with
television viewing. Family income, rural status, and employ-
ment were included to control for availability of activities for
adolescents that are substitutes for television. Finally, school-
level characteristics (eg, racial composition and income) were
included to capture differences in the school environment across
individuals. Since geographic identifiers are unavailable in the
data set, no variables that directly measure community access
to television programming can be used in the analysis.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The analytical approaches included multivariate linear regres-
sion and 2-stage least squares regression using the Huber-White
estimator of variance to account for the fact that more than 1 child
was assessed in each school.14 Wave II sample weights were also
used to adjust for the complex sampling design in the data. The
estimated regression model was of the following form:
Yis
= X
æ
is
+ X
æ
-is
+ Y
æ
is
+ 
is
where individual i in school s chooses television viewing level Yis
and has individual characteristics X. School-level variables are in-
cluded in X
fl (with individual i omitted), and school-level televi-
sion choices are included in Y
fl (with individual i omitted). The
main parameter of interest is , which is the estimate of the im-
portanceofsocialinteractioninindividualtelevisionchoices.Two-
stage least squares regression is necessary in the empirical analy-
sis because group behavior affects individual behavior and vice
versa. This simultaneity in choices leads to the reflection prob-
lem first discussed by Manski15,16 in the economics literature. The
reflection problem occurs in most empirical research that at-
temptstodemonstrateanassociationbetweenindividual-leveland
group-level behavior. Manski proved that most estimates of  are
notidentifiedwithoutusinginstrumentalvariablesorothermeth-
ods.16 The instrumental variables approach solves the reflection
problem by finding a variable that is related to the individual out-
come at the individual level but not at the group level.17,18 For
this analysis, employment status was used to identify the rela-
tionship between group television viewing and individual tele-
vision viewing. Intuitively, the assumption is that an individu-
al's employment status is related (negatively) to the individual's
television viewing, because individuals who are employed have
less available time to watch television, but the proportion of em-
ployed students in an individual's school is not associated with
the individual's choice of how much television to watch. The pro-
portion of employed students is assumed to affect the individu-
al's television viewing only through its affect on the school-level
television viewing measure.
RESULTS
Table 1 gives descriptive statistics of the variables used
in the study. The mean number of hours per week of tele-
vision viewing was almost 15. The average number of chil-
dren in the 131 schools in the sample was nearly 40. Stu-
dents are exposed to a wide variety of school-level
employment;theschool-levelproportionofstudentswork-
ing varies from 0% to 95% of the sampled student body.
Finally, the school-level average number of hours of tele-
vision viewing varies between 2 and 32 hours per week.

terminants of individual hours of television viewing. Be-
fore examining potential social interactions, ordinary least

level correlates of individual television hours are listed
in column 1. Robust standard errors that allow for cor-
related errors at the school level are shown under the co-
efficients, and wave II sample weights are used. Male stu-
dents report watching 2 hours of television per week more
than female students. While black students report 5 more
hours of television viewing than do white students, there
was little difference between white and Hispanic stu-
dents in television viewing time. As students age, they
report watching less television. Employed students re-
port watching television almost 2 hours less than unem-
ployed students do. Students with higher grade point av-
erages also report watching fewer hours of television.
Finally, while family income had a small and statisti-
cally insignificant relationship with television viewing,
students who attended schools with wealthier class-
mates report less television viewing.
Column 2 lists results for 2-stage least squares analy-
sis. To estimate this empirical model, an instrumental vari-
able must be chosen. Without an instrumental variable,
the coefficient of interest ( in the equation) is not iden-
tified. The instrumental variable must meet 2 criteria for
the estimation results to be valid. First, the variable must
be strongly related to the school-level average of televi-
sion hours. This criterion was met because the (unre-
ported) first-stage relationship between school-level em-
ployment and school-level television hours had a t statistic
of almost 17. Second, the variable must be uncorrelated
with the unobserved error term. Because it was impos-
sible to document that this criterion is satisfied, in prac-
tice it must be assumed. Suggestive evidence that school-
level employment was uncorrelated with the unobserved
error can be found in the result from column 1 that school-
level employment was uncorrelated with the individual
choice of television hours.
The results in column 2 for individual and family vari-
ables change little from the results in column 1. The main
result was that the level of school television viewing was
positively related to individual hours. The results sug-
gest that a 1-hour increase in school-level hours in-
creases the individual's television viewing by almost half
an hour per week (95% confidence interval, 0.06-0.82).

are television choices correlated within school, but deci-
sions by peers of how much television to watch affects tele-
vision choices at the individual level. However, since this
framework can only show the existence of social influ-
ences on individual decisions and not the mechanism un-
derlying the process, why and how the social influences
affect individual decisions are unclear. It could be that in-
dividuals in the same school watch similar amounts of tele-
visionsothattheycandiscusstelevisionduringschool.The
data set contained information only on hours of television
watched and not specific content, which does not allow the
hypothesized mechanism to be tested explicitly.19 Further
examinations of the mechanism through which social in-
teractions shape individuals' television choices are an im-
portant area for future research.
Several important limitations of this research require
elaboration. It is possible that the ability of parents to
choose schools for their children account for some por-
tion of the relationship. If parents who do not actively
monitor their children's television viewing send their chil-
dren to similar schools, a portion of the results could be
spurious. This unobserved parental trait would have to
be inadequately controlled for in the covariates for this
to be a substantive concern. Including a variable that mea-
sures the frequency of parental participation in parent-
teacher association events was not significant when in-
cluded in the regression analyses. While this variable was
not available for all students, it does allow some confi-
dence that the results are likely not significantly af-
fected by unobserved parental characteristics.
An additional potential weakness of this research has
been the reliance on measures of self-reported television
viewing rather than actual viewing.20-23 This problem is not
unique to this research but might be particularly concern-
ing if self-reported measures of television viewing are af-
fected by social norms within schools. Examination of this
issue would require additional data that are unavailable.
With these caveats in mind, overall the results suggest
the presence of social interactions in adolescents' televi-
sionchoices.Theimportanceofthisfindingforpolicymak-
ers is that social interactions imply that policies that shape
social norms in schools could be an effective direction for
interventions to reduce television viewing. In addition, in-
terventionsonasubsetofstudentswithinschoolsarelikely
to have a spillover effect on students in the same school
who did not receive the intervention. Both types of inter-
ventions represent interesting areas for future efforts to de-
crease television viewing among adolescents.
