ABSTRACT
Objectives: Determine whether body mass index (BMI)
and physical activity (PA) above, at or below MET
minute per week (MMW) levels recommended in the
2008 Physical Activity Guidelines interact or have
additive effects on interleukin (IL)-6, C reactive protein
(CRP), fibrinogen, interleukin6 (IL-6) soluble receptor
(IL-6sr), soluble E-selectin and soluble intracellular
adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1.
Design: Archived cohort data (n=1254, age 54.5
±11.7 year, BMI 29.8±6.6 kg/m2) from the National
Survey of Midlife Development in the USA (MIDUS)
Biomarkers Study were analysed for concentrations of
inflammatory markers using general linear models.
MMW was defined as no regular exercise, <500 MMW,
500­1000 MMW, >1000 MMW and BMI was defined
as <25, 25­29.9, 30 kg/m2. Analyses were adjusted
for age, sex, smoking and relevant medication use.
Setting: Respondents reported to three centres to
complete questionnaires and provide blood samples.
Participants: Participants were men and women
currently enroled in the MIDUS Biomarker Project
(n=1254, 93% non-Hispanic white, average age
54.5 years).
Primary outcome measures: Concentration of serum
IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, IL-6sr, sE-selectin and sICAM.
Results: Significant interactions were found between
BMI and MMW for CRP and sICAM-1 (p<0.05). CRP in
overweight individuals was similar to that in obese
individuals when no PA was reported, but it was
similar to normal weight when any level of regular PA
was reported. sICAM-1 was differentially lower in
obese individuals who reported >1000 MMW
compared to obese individuals reporting less exercise.
Conclusions: The association of exercise with CRP and
sICAM-1 differed by BMI, suggesting that regular
exercise may buffer weight-associated elevations in
CRP in overweight individuals while higher levels of
exercise may be necessary to reduce sICAM-1 or CRP
in obese individuals.
INTRODUCTION
Obesity paired with low physical activity is
well known to increase morbidity and mortal-
ity related to cardiovascular disease (CVD).1
ARTICLE SUMMARY
Article focus
 Systemic inflammation is related to the progres-
sion of cardiovascular disease.
 Independent of obesity, physical activity is
inversely related to concentrations of well-
established inflammatory biomarkers, such as
C reactive protein (CRP) or interleukin-6 (IL-6).
 This article evaluates the interactive effects of body
mass index and physical activity on the established
inflammatory markers, CRP and IL-6, and emer-
ging inflammatory markers, fibrinogen, soluble
intracellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, soluble
E-selectin and IL-6 soluble receptor.
Key messages
 The interactive effects of body mass index and
physical activity were observed for CRP, such
that regular physical activity reported by over-
weight individuals was related to significantly
lower CRP levels compared to those reporting
no regular activity.
 Independent of BMI, regular physical activity was
related to lower IL-6, with a trend for lower
fibrinogen.
 Physical activity had no independent effect on
circulating markers related to endothelial inflam-
mation, such as sICAM-1 or sE-selectin.
Strengths and limitations of this study
 A total of 1254 adults from the National Survey
of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS) Biomarker Project were analysed.
Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, sex,
smoking and relevant medication use. The
strength of this paper is categorising physical
activity levels based on national recommenda-
tions. These data may be used to determine the
appropriate levels of physical activity necessary
for reducing inflammation in overweight and
obese adults. However, cross-sectional data are
limited, as causal inferences cannot be obtained.
A second limitation is that the sample was pre-
dominantly comprised of non-Hispanic white
individuals, and therefore the findings may not
extend to all ethnicities.

Open Access Research
It is less clear, however, whether the benefits of higher
levels of physical activity differ among normal weight,
overweight and obese individuals.
Chronic, low-grade inflammation, marked by eleva-
tions in cytokines, acute phase reactants and soluble
adhesion molecules, is a developing CVD risk factor.2 3
Circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C reactive protein
(CRP) are both considered to be established inflamma-
tory markers related to CVD.3 Fibrinogen, soluble intra-
cellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1) and soluble
e-selectin (sE-selectin) also have key roles in the progres-
sion of CVD and have been associated with elevated
risk.4­6 Obesity is strongly associated with greater con-
centrations of inflammatory markers.7 8 Further, body
fat distribution is also an important factor relating to
inflammatory status. Accumulation of fat in visceral
depots is more strongly associated with low-grade inflam-
mation compared to accumulation of fat in subcutane-
ous or hip-region depots.9 10
The effects of physical activity on markers of inflam-
mation are more complex and may vary depending on
body weight. A number of epidemiological studies have
shown an inverse relationship between physical activity
and CRP and IL-6, independent of obesity.11­16
Laboratory studies conducted in aerobically trained, typ-
ically normal weight individuals have demonstrated that
a single bout of exercise stimulates IL-6 release from
skeletal muscle, which promotes anti-inflammatory
effects,17­19 as opposed to adipose tissue-derived IL-6
that is associated with proinflammatory effects.20
Randomised controlled trials have also been conducted,
often in populations that also tend to be overweight or
obese, to examine the effects of aerobic exercise inter-
ventions on inflammation and the results are mixed.21
Thus, the contribution of physical activity to inflamma-
tion in the context of obesity remains unclear.
The purpose of our study was to disentangle the rela-
tive contributions of BMI and physical activity recorded
in MET minutes per week (MMW) to circulating levels
of IL-6, IL-6sr, CRP, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin in
middle-aged adults. MMW categories for this study were
determined using values put forth by the Physical
Activity Guidelines for Americans, which states that total
weekly physical activity in the range of 500­1000
MET-minutes (approximately equivalent to 150­300 min
of moderate or 75­150 min of vigorous activity per
week) produces substantial health benefits for adults.22
We hypothesised that BMI and MMW would interact,
such that the greater MMW reported would lessen the
impact of obesity on markers of inflammation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design and sample
This study was a cross-sectional analysis of archived data
(BMI, self-reported physical activity and inflammatory
biomarker concentrations) from 1254 respondents who
provided consent (as approved by The University of
Wisconsin Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review
Board) and were subsequently enroled in the National
Survey of Midlife Development in the USA (MIDUS)
Biomarkers Study.23 The Biomarker Project was one of
five projects within MIDUS II set up with the purpose of
adding comprehensive biological assessments on a sub-
sample of the MIDUS participants to further understand
age-related differences in physical and mental health.
Participants were eligible for The Biomarker Project if
they were previously enroled in MIDUS and MIDUS II,
which recruited non-institutionalised, English-speaking
adults residing in the contiguous USA aged 25­74.
Exclusion criteria included non-participation in MIDUS
and MIDUS II and an unwillingness to travel to specified
sites for biomarker assessment. The random digit dialling
sample for the parent study was selected from working
telephone banks, and a list of all individuals aged
between 25 and 74 years within each household was gen-
erated in order to select a random respondent. Those
who agreed to participate in the Biomarker Study stayed
overnight at one of three General Clinical Research
Centers: University of California Los Angeles, University
of Wisconsin-Madison and Georgetown University. Upon
arrival, each respondent provided a detailed medical
history (including physical activity levels) and all prescrip-
tion, over-the-counter and alternative medications to be
inventoried by project staff. Following an overnight stay,
morning fasting blood samples were obtained. Cohorts
were assessed between July 2004 and May 2009 as a
follow-up to MIDUS I respondents who were previously
surveyed by the MacArthur Midlife Research Network
between 1995 and 1996. Based on the MIDUS Biomarker
Project sample of 1254 participants, 80% power was esti-
mated to detect small effect sizes (=0.08 and higher)
with an  level at 0.05 for a two-tailed test.24 25
Anthropometrics
Height was measured in centimetres and recorded to
the nearest millimetre. A single measure of WC was
taken directly on the skin or over a single layer of light,
with close-fitting clothing at the narrowest point between
the ribs and the iliac crest in centimetres to the nearest
millimetre. Weight was measured in kilograms and BMI
was calculated by dividing body mass in kilograms by
height in metres squared. BMI categories were organised
into three groups--normal weight (BMI 24.9 kg/m2),
overweight (BMI25­29.9) and obese (BMI30).
Categorising physical activity by MET-minutes per week
The MMW variable was calculated using data provided
in the medical history form. The form first described
three types of regular physical activity
 Vigorous: It causes your heart to beat so rapidly that
you can feel it in your chest and you perform it long
enough to work up a good sweat and breathe heavily
(eg, competitive sports, running, vigorous swimming,
high intensity aerobics, digging in the garden or
lifting heavy objects).

BMI, Physical activity and inflammation
 Moderate: It causes your heart rate to increase slightly
and you typically work up a sweat (eg, leisurely sports
like light tennis, slow or light swimming, low intensity
aerobics or golfing without a power cart, brisk
walking, mowing the lawn with a walking
lawnmower).
 Light: It requires little physical effort (eg, light house-
keeping like dusting or laundry, bowling, archery, easy
walking, golfing with a power cart or fishing).
Keeping these definitions in mind, participants were
asked if they engaged in regular physical activity of any
type for 20 min or more at least three times per week
(yes or no). If participants answered "yes", they entered
up to seven types of seasonal and/or non-seasonal exer-
cise or activity along with the frequency, duration and
intensity.
MMW were calculated in a two-step process. Step 1:
participants who reported no physical activity (for whom
no MMW calculations could be made) were designated
as the no regular exercise group (NRE). Step 2: for par-
ticipants who indicated that they performed regular
physical activity, total MMW were calculated by multiply-
ing minutes per week by intensity level (1.1 for low, 3.0
for moderate and 6.0 for vigorous) and summed across
each non-seasonal activity reported. Four groups reflect-
ing participation in physical activity and whether or not
their participation was below, at or above United States
Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS)
guidelines were created: NRE (reported no regular
physical activity), below recommended (reported
<500 MMW), recommended (reported 500­1000 MMW)
and above recommended (reported >1000 MMW).
Blood collection, processing and assays
Participants were asked to avoid strenuous activity on the
day of blood collection. Venous blood samples were col-
lected in 10 ml serum separator vacutainers following a
12-h overnight fast and processed at a General Clinical
Research Center using standardised procedures. Blood
samples were not collected at any specific point during
the menstrual cycle in female participants. Briefly, fol-
lowing collection, vacutainers were allowed to stand 15­
30-min (2-h maximum) prior to centrifugation at 4°C
for 20-min at 2000­3000 rpm. Serum samples were
frozen and shipped to the MIDUS Biocore Lab and
treated and/or analysed for inflammation markers (IL-6,
IL-6sr, CRP, fibrinogen, sE-selectin and sICAM-1).
IL-6 and IL-6sr were assayed in the MIDUS Biocore
Laboratory (University of Madison, Madison WI) using
Quantikine High-sensitivity ELISA kits (cat# HS600B
and cat# DR600, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota,
USA). Plates were read at 490 and 450 nm, respectively,
for IL-6 and IL-6sr using a Dynex MRXe plate reader
(Magellan Biosciences, Chantilly, Virginia, USA).
Intra-assay and interassay precision (CV%) for IL-6 was
approximately 4.1% and 13%, respectively. CV% values
for IL-6sr were 5.9­5.7% and 2.0%, respectively.
Assays for sICAM-1, sE-selectin, fibrinogen and CRP
were performed at the Laboratory for Clinical
Biochemistry Research (University of Vermont,
Burlington, Vermont, USA). Measurement of sICAM-1
was completed using an ELISA assay (Parameter-Human
sICAM-1 Immunoassay; R&D Systems). Inter-assay preci-
sion for sICAM-1 was 5.0%. Measurement of sE-selectin
was completed using a high-sensitivity ELISA assay
(Parameter Human sE-Selectin Immunoassay, R&D
Systems). Intra-assay and inter-assay precision for
sE-selectin was 4.7­5.0% and 5.7­8.8%, respectively.
Fibrinogen was measured using the BNII nephelometer
(N Antiserum to Human Fibrinogen; Dade Behring Inc,
Deerfield, Illinois, USA). Intra-assay and inter-assay pre-
cision for fibrinogen was 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively.
CRP was analysed using a BNII nephelometer with a par-
ticle enhanced immunonepolometric assay. Intra-assay
and inter-assay precision for CRP was 2.3­4.4% and
2.1­5.7%, respectively.
Statistical analyses
All variables were assessed for normality and non-normal
data were log transformed, which included data for CRP,
IL-6, IL-6sr, fibrinogen, sE-selectin and sICAM-1.
General linear models were performed to determine the
relationship of MMW and BMI with the inflammatory
markers. For each outcome, the ordinal MMW and BMI
factors were entered as independent factors with an
interaction term. If the interaction term was not signifi-
cant, the interaction term was dropped and the model
was refit for main effects only. Pairwise comparisons
were assessed using post hoc univariate analyses with a
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Covariates for all models included factors that are
known to affect inflammatory status--age, sex, smoking
and relevant medications (cholesterol-lowering, corticos-
teroids, antidiabetics, antidepressants, hormone replace-
ments and hormonal contraceptives). Race was initially
included as a covariate; however, approximately 200 data
points were lost in the analyses owing to incomplete
racial data. As race was not found to be a predictor of
our dependent variables, with the exception of sICAM-1,
race was excluded as a covariate to increase sample size
in all analyses excluding sICAM-1. All statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS V.17 (Chicago, Illinois, USA)
and statistical significance was set =0.05.
In an exploratory analysis, we examined whether the
relative effects of BMI and MMW on the inflammatory
markers differed by sex in three-way interaction models.
As none of the interactions approached statistical signifi-
cance (data not shown), sex was retained as a covariate
in the models.

participants (n=1254). Participants were 92.6%
non-Hispanic white, 56.8% female and, on average,
middle-aged and overweight. Of all the respondents,
14.9% were currently smokers, 27.8% were taking
cholesterol-lowering medications, 12.1% corticosteroids,
10.4% antidiabetic medications, 14.2% antidepressant
medications, 7.3% hormone replacements and 2.5%
oral contraceptives. The percentages of participants with
missing data for each variable were as follows: 1.6% for
CRP, 1.0% for sICAM-1, 1.0% for IL-6, 1.6% for fibrino-
gen, 1.2% for sE-selectin, and 1.0% for IL-6sr.
C reactive protein
We found a significant interaction between BMI and
MMW for CRP concentration (F=3.022, p=0.006;
figure 1A). In post hoc comparisons, CRP levels were
higher in overweight and obese participants compared to
normal weight participants among those who reported
no regular exercise (p<0.001). However, among partici-
pants who reported any amount of regular exercise
(<500, 500­1000 or >1000 MMW), CRP levels were signifi-
cantly greater only in obese participants compared to
both normal weight and overweight participants
(p<0.01). In obese individuals, CRP tended to be lower in
those reporting >1000 MMW compared to those report-
ing no regular exercise (p=0.053).
We also found main effects of BMI (F=130.873
p<0.001) and MMW (F=11.576, p<0.001) on CRP. CRP
was significantly greater with each increasing BMI cat-
egory, in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.001).
Compared to participants who reported no regular exer-
cise, CRP was significantly lower in those who reported
500­1000 and >1000 MMW (p<0.01), with a trend for
lower CRP in those who reported <500 MMW of regular
exercise (p=0.078).
sICAM-1
We found a significant interaction between BMI and
MMW for sICAM-1 concentration (F=2.701, p=0.013)
(figure 1B). Levels of sICAM-1 were significantly lower
in obese participants who reported >1000 MMW com-
pared to obese participants who reported no regular
exercise (p=0.014) and <500 MMW (p=0.026) and
tended to be lower than levels in obese participants who
reported 500­1000 MMW (p=0.079). No differences in
sICAM-1 by MMW were observed among normal weight
or overweight individuals.
We also observed a main effect of BMI (F=6.060,
p=0.002), such that sICAM-1 levels in obese participants

BMI, Physical activity and inflammation
were significantly higher than levels found in both
normal weight and overweight participants (p<0.01). No
significant main effect of MMW was found for sICAM-1
(F=0.931, p=0.425).
Interleukin L-6
Both BMI and MMW had independent effects on circu-
lating concentrations of IL-6 (BMI F=60.150, p<0.001,
MMW: F=10.680, p<0.001), with no significant inter-
action (F=1.21, p=0.297) (figure 1C). We found a dose-
dependent effect of BMI, such that higher BMI levels
were associated with significantly greater IL-6 (p<0.001).
Independent of BMI, IL-6 was significantly lower in par-
ticipants who reported regular exercise (<500 MMW,
500­1000 MMW and >1000 MMW) compared to those
who reported no regular exercise (p<0.01) with no dif-
ference between levels of MMW.
Fibrinogen
BMI contributed significantly to circulating levels of
fibrinogen (F=42.385, p<0.001), such that dose-
dependent increases were observed for all BMI levels
(p<0.01) (figure 1D). While we observed a trend for
lower fibrinogen with regular physical activity, similar to
that of IL-6, the effect did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (F=2.187, p=0.088). We observed no significant
interaction between BMI and MMW for fibrinogen
(F=1.680, p=0.122).
sE-Selectin
BMI contributed significantly to circulating levels of
sE-selectin (F=28.253, p<0.001), with no significant con-
tribution by MMW (F=0.207, p=0.892; figure 1E).
Dose-dependent increases in sE-selectin were also
observed across BMI levels (p<0.01). We observed no sig-
nificant interaction between BMI and MMW for
sE-selectin (F=0.570, p=0.755).
IL-6sr
No significant main effects for BMI (F=1.783, p=0.169),
MMW (F=1.434, p=0.231) or their interaction (F=0.834,
p=0.544) were detected for IL-6sr (figure 1F).

BMI, Physical activity and inflammation
Waist circumference and inflammatory markers
A secondary analysis was completed using waist circum-
ference (WC) and MMW as independent variables and
the complete results of these analyses are located in the
supplemental information (see online supplementary
figure S1). Briefly, we found a significant interaction
between WC and MMW on sICAM-1. In individuals with
an at-risk WC (102.0 cm for men and 88.0 cm for
women), sICAM-1 was significantly lower in those report-
ing 1000+ MMW compared to less than 500 MMW and
tended to be lower in those reporting no regular exer-
cise. Overall, the main effects were similar to those
found for BMI and MMW analyses. Having an at-risk WC
was independently related to higher levels of CRP,
sICAM-1, IL-6, fibrinogen and sE-selectin. Independent
of WC, any level of regular exercise was related to lower
levels of CRP, IL-6 with a similar tendency for
fibrinogen.
DISCUSSION
The current study aimed to determine whether the
impact of BMI and MMW on inflammatory markers
varied by level of overweight or obesity. For CRP and
s-ICAM-1, regular physical activity appeared to diminish
the effects of higher BMI compared to those who
reported no regular physical activity. In addition, we
found that BMI was strongly and independently related
to greater concentrations of both established and emer-
ging inflammatory markers that may increase CVD risk.
Independent of BMI, regular physical activity was also
associated with lower IL-6, with a similar trend for
fibrinogen. These results suggest that although obesity
has a clear impact on inflammation, physical activity
appears to mitigate at least some of this effect.
For example, overweight individuals had CRP levels
which were similar to levels observed in obese indivi-
duals if they reported no regular exercise (4.05 and
4.83 g/ml, respectively). CRP levels greater than 3 g/
ml are typically associated with high CVD risk.26 In over-
weight participants who reported regular physical activity
of at least three 20-min sessions per week (be it below
(<500), within (500­1000) or above (>1000) USDHHS
MMW recommendations), CRP levels were lower and
not significantly different from CRP levels found in
normal weight participants. This suggests that increasing
physical activity level to a minimum of 3 days/week, at
least 20 min/day, may improve CRP profiles among over-
weight individuals.
Obese individuals may require a higher level of
regular physical activity in order to lower inflammatory
markers. While obese participants also had greater levels
of CRP and sICAM-1 compared to lean and overweight
participants, those who reported >1000 MMW (above
the USDHHS recommendation) had lower levels of
sICAM-1 and tended to have lower CRP than obese par-
ticipants reporting no regular physical activity. Taken
together, we may speculate that while physical activity
levels currently recommended for the general popula-
tion may reduce particular inflammatory makers in over-
weight populations, obese populations may require
greater levels of physical activity above the recom-
mended values to reduce inflammatory markers like
CRP and sICAM-1.
As expected, strong main effects of BMI were observed
for CRP, IL-6, fibrinogen, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin, in
agreement with previous work.27­30 Independent of BMI
effects, our results suggest that physical activity has dif-
ferentiating effects on inflammatory markers.
Individuals reporting no regular physical activity had
higher levels of IL-6 with a tendency for higher fibrino-
gen, compared to those reporting any level of regular
physical activity (<500, 500­1000 or >1000 MMW).
Similar results have been observed in the MONItoring
trends and determinants in the CArdiovascular disease
(MONICA) study,31 the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III)12 14 and the
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA),32 such
that both the increased frequency and intensity of phys-
ical activity have been related to lower IL-6 and fibrino-
gen. Our findings add to these prior results by
standardising levels of physical activity by using
USDHHS. Our results suggest that regular physical activ-
ity at any level (<500, 500­1000, >1000) appears to be
associated with lower levels of IL-6 and possibly fibrino-
gen, independent of BMI.
Although IL-6 produced in hypertrophied adipose
tissue33 34 initiates the acute phase response, marked by
the release of hepatic CRP,35 36 an interaction between
BMI and physical activity was detected for CRP, but not
IL-6. While IL-6 and CRP were significantly correlated
(r=0.514, see online supplementary table S1), this correl-
ation suggests that IL-6 levels do not fully explain CRP
levels at any given moment. Further, CRP is a more
stable biomarker, owing to its substantially longer plasma
half-life,37 which may improve our ability to detect inter-
action effects in CRP compared to IL-6.
Interestingly, our results also suggest that regular exer-
cise may have a more profound impact on lowering clas-
sical markers of inflammation and less impact on the
inflammatory status of the endothelium. Regular phys-
ical activity has reliably been associated with lower levels
of IL-6 and CRP, both classical inflammatory markers
related to adipose and systemic inflammation.38
However, regular exercise appeared to have no inde-
pendent impact on markers of endothelial activation,
particularly sE-selectin. Higher levels of exercise were
related to lower sICAM-1 in obese individuals only. In
one prior study, inverse relationships between physical
activity and sICAM-1 and sE-selectin were reported in
drug-treated hypertensive men.39 Thus, further research
is necessary to understand mechanisms underlying dif-
ferential associations of exercise with systemic and endo-
thelial inflammation.
Several limitations must be addressed. First, the cross-
sectional design does not allow us to infer causal

BMI, Physical activity and inflammation
relationships. Prospective and interventional designs are
necessary to confirm our findings. No objective mea-
sures of physical activity were available in the MIDUS
sample. Therefore, the use of self-report physical activity
data may have diminished our ability to detect effects.
However, in addition to being in line with previous
studies using self-report physical activity, our findings are
also in line with previous studies40 41 that demonstrated
that higher cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by
indirect calorimetry, was associated with lower levels of
inflammation independent of visceral adiposity or BMI.
Another limitation is that the sample was predominantly
comprised of non-Hispanic white individuals, suggesting
that the findings may not extend to all ethnicities.
Finally, BMI and physical activity variables are correlated,
potentially raising the concern of small sample sizes in
specific groups crossed by BMI and MMW. However, the
smallest group for analyses still contained 54 individuals
(normal weight individuals reporting no exercise).
In summary, our results demonstrate both the inter-
active and independent influences of BMI and levels of
physical activity on both established and emerging
markers of inflammation. Inflammation is both a conse-
quence of obesity and a mechanism promoting CVD.
Regular physical activity appears to mitigate the effects
of higher BMI on some inflammatory markers, particu-
larly CRP, which is strongly implicated in CVD.
Importantly, while any level of regular physical activity
may help reduce inflammation in overweight indivi-
duals, similar effects in obese individuals may require
levels of physical activity that are greater than currently
recommended by the USDHHS for general health.
