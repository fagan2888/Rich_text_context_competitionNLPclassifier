ABSTRACT
There have been considerable interests in attempting to re-
verse the deficit because of an SCI (spinal cord injury) by
restoring neural pathways through the lesion and by rebuild-
ing the tissue network. In order to provide an appropriate
micro-environment for regrowing axotomized neurons and
proliferating and migrating cells, we have implanted a small
block of pHPMA [poly N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide]
hydrogel into the hemisected T10 rat spinal cord. Locomotor
activity was evaluated once a week during 14 weeks with
the BBB rating scale in an open field. At the 14th week
after SCI, the reflexivity of the sub-lesional region was mea-
sured. We also monitored the ventilatory frequency during
an electrically induced muscle fatigue known to elicit the
muscle metaboreflex and increase the respiratory rate. Spinal
cords were then collected, fixed and stained with anti-ED-1

this study that hydrogel-implanted animals exhibit: (i) an
improved locomotor BBB score, (ii) an improved breathing
adjustment to electrically evoked isometric contractions and
(iii) an H-reflex recovery close to control animals. Qualitative
histological results put in evidence higher accumulation of

neuromuscular adaptive mechanisms and H-reflex responses
after SCI.

INTRODUCTION
An SCI (spinal cord injury) induces axonal degeneration fol-
lowed by cellular reactions that lead to a glial scar formation
that forms a tight barrier and to post-traumatic pseudocyst
cavities. All of these reactions induce network disorgani-
zation and mechanically hinder the axonal regeneration of
injured CNS (central nervous system) neurons (Berry et al.,
1983; Fitch et al., 1999). Furthermore, the glial response in-
volves microglia, meningeal cells, astrocytes and oligoden-
drocyte precursors, the majority of which produce molecules
known to inhibit the axonal elongation (Fawcett and Asher,
1999).
One of the methods to limit the glial scar formation is
to re-form the tissue structure and to promote axonal re-
generation across such CNS by the use of biomaterial-based
scaffolds to bridge the lesion site. Scaffolds may serve as a
matrix for cell growth within the inhibitory region of the
injury, may allow the diffusion of various neuroactive sub-
stances including growth factors and may provide a permis-
sive environment supporting the regrowth of axons through
the lesion site.
The use of various biomaterials has been proven to be
effective in providing a cellular framework for regenerat-
ing tissue (Kliot et al., 1990; Woerly, 1993; Woerly et al.,
1993; Xu et al., 1995; Meek et al., 2001; Oudega et al., 2001;
Wan et al., 2001; Ahmed et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2005; Stang
et al., 2005). Most of these biomaterials used in tissue engi-
neering studies published to date have been based on PGA
[poly(glycolic)], PLA [poly(lactic acid)] and their copolymers.
Although they have a wide acceptance, these polymers ex-
hibit some disadvantages: (i) they are not elastomeric, (ii)
they are hydrophobic, (iii) they break down into acidic prod-
ucts that are incompatible with cell growth, (iv) the acidic
breakdown products autocatalyse further polymer break-
down, often leading to catastrophic disintegration of larger
masses of polymer, and (v) they are difficult to derivate
chemically.
Non-resorbable polymers are suitable implantation ma-
terials. Acrylate and methacrylate polymers are tolerated
in vivo. These polymers with hydrophilic substitute groups
can form hydrogels that are suitable in medicine and biol-
ogy applications because of their high water content and
favourable mechanical properties. Indeed, they are water-
swollen polymers with a macromolecular three-dimensional
network that resembles a sponge. Moreover, they are also
stable, biocompatible, with a viscoelasticity close to living
tissues, with a porosity allowing neuroactive molecules, nu-
triments and metabolites to permeate through the matrix,
and have the ability to entrap cells that act as a source of
extracellular matrix (Atzet et al., 2008). Among candidates,
hydrogels of pHEMA [poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)] are
known to present the previously cited characteristics. They
can be fabricated in various architectures with mechanical
properties that are similar to natural tissue (Homsy, 1970;
Ratner and Miller, 1973; Peppas et al., 1985; Metters et al.,
1999; Pradny et al., 2002; Bakshi et al., 2004; Pradny et al.,
2005; Atzet et al., 2008). Thus, these hydrogels are attrac-
tive materials for axonal regeneration in the CNS because
macroporous pHEMA hydogels can be synthesized using a
variety of chemistries, resulting in a range of microstruc-
tures with varying degrees of porosity and pore size in which
injured axons should regrow, i.e. they can be used as bridg-
ing structures providing physical as well as trophic support
for the regenerative process. Hydrogels based on crosslinked
pHPMA [poly N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide] are also
known to have the potential for facilitating tissue regener-
ation in the injured spinal cord (Woerly, 2000; Woerly et al.,
2001a, 2001b, 2001c, 2004, 2005; Sykova and Jendelova,
2007), the brain (Lesny et al., 2002) and the optic tract
(Loh et al., 2001). This pHPMA provides a porous environ-
ment into which cells from the intact neural parenchyma can
migrate.
It is well established that, after a trauma, many differ-
entiated neurons trans-synaptically degenerate below and
above the lesion, but some motoneurons survive and re-
main functional (Kaelan et al., 1988; Eidelberg et al., 1989;
Bjugn et al., 1997; Chang, 1998; Jimenez et al., 2000; Button
et al., 2008). As a result, spinal segments that are not fully
injured remain able to exhibit functional activity medi-
ated by reflex pathways. The Hoffman (H)-reflex, which is
the electrical analogue of the monosynaptic stretch reflex,
can be used to assess the excitability of motoneuron pools
(Hunt, 1955; Gozariu et al., 1998; Manjarrez et al., 2000; Chen
et al., 2002). More precisely, it provides information on the
functional properties of the Ia afferents and homonymous
-motoneurons, under physiological and pathological con-
ditions (Pierrot-Deseilligny and Mazevet, 2000). It is a com-
monly used clinical tool (Misiaszek, 2003; Yablon and Stokic,
2004) that yields information about altered properties of
the reflex after SCI. The H-reflex is elicited by an electrical
stimulation of a peripheral nerve that innervates the muscle
from which the reflex is recorded. A single stimulus generates
a short-latency M-wave, resulting from direct stimulation
of the motor axons, and a long-latency H-wave elicited by
the activation of -motoneurons activated by Ia afferents
(Gozariu et al., 1998). The amplitude of the H-reflex has been
shown to be proportional to the number of activated mo-
toneurons (Magladery and Teasdall, 1958) and the reflex rep-
resents a good measure of the transmission between muscle
afferents and motoneurons (Magladery et al., 1951a, 1951b;
Burke et al., 1984). In normal subjects, the H-wave ampli-
tude remains constant (Hasegawa and Ono, 1996a, 1996b)
and a depression is observed when frequency stimulation
increases. However, after SCI, H-reflex increases in ampli-
tude (Malmsten, 1983) and the decrease in H-wave ampli-
tude becomes less sensitive to stimulus frequency, resulting
in a higher H/M ratio compared with corresponding frequen-
cies in uninjured control (Thompson et al., 1992; Calancie
et al., 1993). Such phenomenon results in a decrease of the
presynaptic inhibition by local interneurons on Ia afferents

pHPMA in repair of transected spinal cord
following loss of descending projections from the brainstem
to those interneurons (Delwaide et al., 1973). The elevated
H-reflex amplitude and H/M ratio at the baseline stimulus
frequency are manifestations of hyperexcitability (Delwaide
et al., 1973) and spasticity (Diamantopoulos and Zander
Olsen, 1967; Olsen and Diamantopoulos, 1967; Taylor et al.,
1984) and are used to correlate reflex pathway properties
with functional outcome in animal experiments (Lee et al.,
2005).
In the present study, outcomes of pHPMA hydrogel were
also evaluated during muscle exhaustive exercise. Adjustment
to exercise is a complex phenomenon that could be briefly
described as an increase in oxygen and energetic metabo-
lites supply to working muscle. It is commonly admitted that
exercise induces an increase in HR (heart rate), MABP (mean
arterial blood pressure) and minute ventilation by two classes
of neural mechanisms: (i) the central command system which
involves the direct activation of brainstem locomotion, venti-
latory and autonomic networks by the cerebral processes oc-
curring at the onset of exercise (Krogh and Lindhard, 1913;
Goodwin et al., 1972; Eldridge et al., 1985) and (ii) the re-
flex network resulting of the activation of a complex system
of feedback and feed forward through medullar pathways
(Iwamoto et al., 1985; Rowell and O'Leary, 1990; Kaufman
and Hayes, 2002). Recently, we demonstrated that this reflex
is mediated by metabosensitive afferent fibres from groups III
and IV whose receptors are uncapsulated nerve endings found
in the connective tissue and in the walls of small vessels
within the muscle respectively (Decherchi et al., 2007). We
also showed that metabolites released from a low-frequency
(10 Hz) electrically stimulated muscle-activated nerve end-
ings that elicited a reflex increase in blood pressure, sym-
pathetic activity and ventilation, in animals whose humoral
communication was abolished. These reflexes are named `Ex-
ercise or Muscle Reflex' (ER or MR) or "Metaboreflex". Af-
ferent inputs from exercising skeletal muscle are believed
to signal the CNS that blood and/or oxygen supply to the
metabolically active tissues is not adequate to meet blood
and/or oxygen demand (Mitchell, 1985; Rowell and O'Leary,
1990). Consequently, metabolic stimuli provide an error sig-
nal indicating that blood supply and demand in contracting
muscle are not matched properly. After a spinal cord trauma,
the metaboreflex originating from skeletal muscle and con-
tributing significantly to the regulation of the cardiovascular
and respiratory systems during exercise is altered (Crisafulli
et al., 2009).
In the present study, we have evaluated the effective-
ness of a pHPMA hydrogel as a implant material to bridge
the defected spinal cord tissue and to facilitate axonal re-
generation. A great attention was paid to neurophysiological
changes that may be related to the development of enhanced
excitability of hind limb reflexes after a SCI. Thus, functional
recovery was assessed by means of two tools­Hoffman (H)-
reflex and respiratory adjustments during muscle induced
fatigue. In addition, qualitative morphology of the injury site
was assessed by estimating the white matter myelin preserva-
tion, the number of macrophages/monocytes (ED-1 positive
cells) at the lesion border and the neurofilament-positive
(NH-F) axon profiles penetrating the hydrogel.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Adult male albino Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old at the
start of the experiment), weighing 300 g (Elevage JANVIER®,
Centre d'Elevage Roger JANVIER), were singly housed in
smooth-bottomed plastic cages at 22C in a colony room
maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with dark onset at
7.00 PM. Food (Purina®, rat chow) and water were avail-
able ad libitum. On arrival, all animals were examined by
a qualified veterinarian. In order to accustom the animals
to the laboratory environment, an acclimation period of
3 weeks was allowed before the initiation of the experi-
ment. All animals were weighted before each experimental
step.
Ethical approval
Anaesthesia and surgical procedures were performed ac-
cording to the French law on animal care guidelines and
the Animal Care Committees of University Aix-Marseille
(Aix-Marseille Universit´
e) and CNRS (Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique) approved our protocols. Individual
conducting researches were listed in the authorized person-
nel section of the animal research protocol or be added to
a previously approved protocol. Furthermore, experiments
were performed following the recommendations provided in
the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US De-
partment of Health and Human Services, National Institutes
of Health) and in accordance with the European Community's
council directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/ EEC). No clin-
ical sign of pain or unpleasant sensation (i.e. screech, prostra-
tion, hyperactivity, anorexia) and no paw-eating behaviour
were observed throughout the study. At the end of the exper-
iments, animals were sacrificed by an intra-arterial overdose
(1 ml) of sodium pentobarbital solution (Nembutal®, Sanofi
Sant´
e Animale, 60 mg kg- 1).
Experimental groups
A total of 35 animals were assigned to the following
treatment groups: (i) unlesioned (control, n = 10), (ii) hemi-
sected non-grafted (lesion, n = 15) in which the lesion cavity
was left empty, (iii) hemisected and immediately implanted
with a block of pHPMA hydrogel into the spinal cavity
(Lesion + Matrix, n = 10).

Hydrogel preparation
Water-soluble matrix was provided by Dr Eric Pinet
(AquaGel Technologies Inc.). Briefly, the macroporous hy-
drogels were prepared from HPMA by heterophase sepa-
ration using radical polymerization in a pore-forming sol-
vent with a divinyl cross-linking agent. The synthesis of the
pHPMAH3
CCH(OH)CH2
NHCOC(CH3
)=CH2
hydrogel was pre-
viously described (Woerly et al., 1998). Following polymer-
ization the gel was extensively washed in water to remove
unreacted products and then stored in distilled water at 4C.
Prior to its use the hydrogel was sterilized by exposure to hot
dry air ( +121C) in autoclave for 15 min.
Hydrogel characteristics
pHPMA is a biocompatible synthetic hydrogel that displays no
signs of toxicity, chronic inflammation or risks of transmitting
disease (Woerly et al., 2001a). This hydrogel is a cross-linked
hydrophilic macromolecular network that has a water frac-
tion of 95.66%. Its mechanical properties, matching those of
the nervous system, allow it to properly fit the lesion cav-
ity and bridge the spinal cord stumps (Woerly et al., 1998).
Moreover, this hydrogel presents a multimodal pore size dis-
tribution from micropores (<2 nm) to macropores (>50 nm;
<300 m) (Woerly et al., 1998). In addition, the intercon-
nected pores allow free transport of macromolecules, mi-
gration of cells and angiogenesis (Woerly, 2000). It was also
observed that axonal regeneration could cross throughout
the hydrogel (Woerly et al., 2004). The large surface/volume
ratio highly encourages tissue formation into the hydrogel
(Woerly, 2000).
Surgical protocol
For the initial surgery, rats were deeply anaesthetized with an
intra-peritoneal injection of chloral hydrate (400 mg kg- 1,
Sigma) and additional (0.1 ml) anaesthesia was given ap-
proximately every 20 min. Atropine (0.2 ml, subcutaneous)
was administered to reduce secretions. Surgical procedures
were performed aseptically with the aid of dissecting micro-
scope. Rats were then positioned in ventral decubitus. The
animal's back was shaved, disinfected (betadine, 5%) and
a midline incision was made over the C6-T13 spinous pro-
cesses. Dorsal muscles were cut and maintained on the side
using retractors while spinous processes of the vertebra T10
were partially removed. Thoracic spinal column was fixed
with the help of haemostatic forceps. A hole was made in
the T10 vertebra arch using a Friedman micro-rongeur. After
bone removal, periosteal membrane was opened with a pair
of sharp tweezers to allow direct visualization of the spinal
cord. The dura was opened longitudinally along the midline
and retracted laterally to expose the dorsal surface of the
cord. Prior to the transection, the spinal cord was rinsed with
cold saline to favour vasoconstriction. Using a microscalpel,
a left hemicordotomy was performed and 1 mm of spinal tis-
sue segment was removed with microforceps and ophthalmic
sponges. Close examination of the cut edges of the cord con-
firmed that the surface of the tissue was free of meninges
or blood clots. The hydrogel implant was sized and adapted
to the dimension and shape of the hemi-cavity. It was in-
troduced into the lesion with a slight downward pressure to
allow settling of the gel using a microspatula and ophthalmic
sponges ensuring apposition of the polymer gel with the ros-
tral, caudal and sagittal surfaces of the spinal tissue. The gel
was hydrated with drops of sterile saline solution to ensure
complete apposition of the surfaces between the polymer
implant and the cord stumps (which was verified under the
surgical microscope under high magnification). The surgi-
cal site containing the polymer implant was covered with a
film of bioabsorbable artificial dural substitute (Seamdura®,
Gunze Ltd., Codman, Johnson and Johnson Company) to iso-
late the gel implant from the overlying muscle and mes-
enchymal tissue. Muscle and skin were sutured (Vicryl® 3-0,
Ethicon France) in anatomical layers. Animals were kept un-
der heat lamps for 12­24 h. They were rehydrated with a
bolus of saline (3 ml, subcutaneous) to replace fluid lost dur-
ing the surgical procedure and received a subcutaneous in-
jection of an antalgic (bupr´
enorphine, 0.05 mg kg- 1). Then,
they were kept in individual cages and observed daily during
the next 14 weeks. The animals were not placed in an en-
riched environment. They were preventively treated (in their
drinking water) with wide spectrum antibiotic (Oxytetracy-
cline, 400 mg l- 1, Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier)
during 1 week. Manual bladder expression was performed
at least twice daily until bladder reflex was re-established
(10-14 days post-surgery).
BBB test
The animals were observed for any spontaneous recovery
of motor activity and postural function of their hindquar-
ters during overground movement. Behavioural evaluation
was performed in an open field, once a week for 14 weeks,
according to the BBB scale (Basso et al., 1995). This locomo-
tor rating scale designed to measure the amount of loco-
motor function evaluates the movements of the rats on a
21-point rating scale, with a score of 21 representing nor-
mal movement and 0 representing complete paralysis of the
hindlimb. This test is based on the normal recovery observed
after a mild SCI and involves detailed analysis of move-
ment including the motion degree of particular joints of the
hindlimbs, trunk stability during movement, weight-bearing
capabilities and the placement of each paw of the hind
limbs.
Recording protocol
Fourteen weeks post-surgery, rats were re-anaesthetized by
an intra-peritoneal injection of solution containing ure-
thane (120 mg kg- 1, Sigma). A tracheotomy was performed.
A catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and
pushed up to the fork of the abdominal aorta. This catheter,

pHPMA in repair of transected spinal cord
which allowed one to inject additional anaesthesia (approxi-
mately 50 mg kg- 1 every hour) to suppress voluntary move-
ment and whisker tremors but maintain corneal reflex, was
positioned in order to let the blood flow freely to the left
lower limb muscles. Animals were placed on a stereotaxic
apparatus (Model 902, David Kopf Instrument). The left per-
oneal nerve was dissected free from surrounding tissues on a
length of 3-4 cm and tendons were left intact. Animals were
then prepared for reflex testing. Urethane does not depress
spinal cord monosynaptic reflexes and does not alter presy-
naptic inhibition. This anaesthetic has been shown to produce
similar negligible effects on H-reflex as ketamine, which is
commonly used for H-reflex recordings (Cliffer et al., 1998).
Core temperature was maintained at 36 +
- 1C using a heat-
ing pad controlled by a thermostat driven by a rectal probe.
To prevent dehydration, subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml of
isotonic glucose­saline, pH balanced to 7.4, were adminis-
tered at 0.5 h intervals. The animal's forelimbs and hindlimbs
were secured with tape while knee and ankle joints were
firmly held by clamps on a horizontal support to prevent any
movement during nerve (H-reflex testing) or muscle (phys-
iological reflexes testing) stimulation. Hindlimbs were only
slightly extended away from the trunk, and care was taken
not to apply any unnecessary pressure or stretch to any part
of the limbs.
M- and H-waves
A bipolar cuff electrode was placed on the peroneal nerve for
stimulation (0.1 ms pulses). The cathode (positive electrode)
was oriented proximally. A pair of wire electrodes was placed
subcutaneously on the Tibialis anterior muscle for EMG (elec-
tromyographic) recording. Ground electrode was implanted
in a nearby muscle. Exposed tissue was covered with paraffin
oil to prevent drying. The recorded signal was passed to a
differential amplifier (P2MP®, 5104B) and bandpass filtered
at 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz. The analogue signal was then sent to
an A/D converter and the digital waveform was stored and
displayed (sampled at 20 KHz, filtered with High Pass at 150
Hz) online using data acquisition software (Biopac MP150®
and AcqKnowledge® software). Stimulation of the peroneal
nerve produced two EMG responses. The earlier response (<
4 ms latency), the M-wave, was due to direct activation of
the motor axons in the peroneal nerve and did not involve
a spinal circuit. The second response (> 4 ms latency), the
monosynaptic H-reflex, was due to the activation of muscle
afferents in the peroneal nerve that synapse on sciatic mo-
toneurons. The H-reflex provides a quantitative measure of
network changes that occur in the spinal cord after injury.
More precisely, changes in the H-wave can be correlated to
the amount of damaged grey matter (D'Angelo, 1973).
In order to elicit the H-reflex, the peroneal nerve was
stimulated using a Grass® S88 stimulator (Astro-Med, Inc.)
delivering bipolar electrical pulses of 0.1 ms duration. Thresh-
old and maximal response amplitudes were measured. Stim-
ulus intensity was gradually increased until both M- and H-
waves were maximal and stable: in the low stimulus intensity,
only M-wave was evoked, whereas the H-wave was observ-
able at higher intensity. Thus, when the Hmax
was reached,
the M-wave amplitude was already maximal. The total mo-
tor unit response was determined by supramaximal stimu-
lation of the peroneal nerve axons to produce a maximal
M-wave.
In a first step, the influence of supraspinal descending ax-
ons on the sub-lesional sensory-motor circuitry was exam-
ined. The H-reflex rate sensitivity (i.e. the decrease in reflex
magnitude relative to repetition rate) was studied (Thompson
et al., 1992; Skinner et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2005; Reese et al.,
2006; Lee et al., 2009; Bianco et al., 2011). A control repeti-
tion rate of 0.3 Hz was used for H-reflexes consistent with
the original studies describing rate-sensitive depression as a
diminished response produced by successive stimuli falling
at intervals of<3 s (Eccles and Rall, 1951). Although a small
depression was subsequently shown to outlast this period,
3.0 s provided a practical compromise between recovery and
efficient performance of the protocols (Lloyd and Wilson,
1957). The amplitudes of the M- and H-waves as determined
by the peak-to-peak values of each waveform were used
to calculate the average Hmax
/Mmax
ratio. The latencies of
the responses were measured as time elapsed between trig-
ger and peak of each waveform. Hmax
/Mmax
ratio provided
an index of motoneurons recruited via a monosynaptic re-
flex relative to the total motoneuron pool (Magladery et al.,
1951a, 1951b; Taborikova, 1966). Accordingly, the H-reflex
magnitude, expressed as a fraction of the M-wave, provided
a standard that could be referenced across animals. There-
after, stimulation was performed at frequencies of 1, 5 and
10 Hz, with a 5-min inter-rate interval. The same stimulus
intensity previously defined (i.e. the minimum stimulus in-
tensity required to elicit maximal H-wave) was used across
the applied frequencies. Immediately after changing to a new
test frequency, the magnitude of the initial two or three re-
flexes progressively reached a new plateau. To decrease the
variability that could be due to this transition, the signal av-
erage, at each test frequency, was recorded after the initial
reflexes to exclude responses with the most acute transi-
tion. Fifteen consecutive waveforms were collected at each
frequency and an average of ten responses was stored af-
ter discarding the first five responses in order to obtain an
average of the stabilized reflex. The Hmax
/Mmax
ratio at 1,
5 and 10 Hz was expressed as a percent of 0.3 Hz baseline
frequency ratio in order to calculate the H-reflex rate de-
pression. Following the frequency series testing, the H-reflex
amplitude was confirmed at 0.3 Hz for consistency. If the
amplitude at recheck was less than 90% of the initial am-
plitude, data were discarded. The M- and H-waves were only
recorded on the left side. The investigator was blind to the
experimental groups during recording and analysis of
the data.
In a second step, the reflex excitability was tested us-
ing a modification of the method reported by Skinner et al.

10 Hz was normally reduced by the second and subsequent
stimuli, probably through presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms.
However, in injured animals, the normal inhibition was ab-
sent, and the H-reflex amplitude remained close to 100% of
its control value. Single square wave stimuli (0.5 ms, 5-15 V)
was used to elicit M-wave and H-reflex and then trains of
five stimuli at 10 Hz are delivered at 5x H-reflex threshold.
As described by Gozariu et al. (1998) in rats, when increas-
ing the stimulation intensity, the M- and H-waves reached a
plateau so that at 5x the H-reflex threshold amplitude of M-
and H-waves were maximal. The amplitude of the M-wave
was monitored throughout the recording period to ensure it
remained constant. H-reflex amplitude of the second, third,
fourth and fifth responses were measured from the average
of three trials and Hmax
/Mmax
ratios (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th) were
expressed as a percentage of the first Hmax
/Mmax
ratio (1st),
also averaged over three trials.
Physiological reflexes
Changes in ventilation were recorded after ipsilateral
T. anterior stimulation to the spinal lesion. The experiments
were performed after regional circulatory occlusion, which
isolated and maintained the neural drive as well as abolish-
ing the humoral communication. In intact animals, repeti-
tive muscle stimulations induced muscle fatigue responsible
of the metabosensitive afferent fibre activation and sub-
sequently a ventilation frequency and amplitude increase
(Decherchi et al., 2007). In animal with an SCI, such stim-
ulation was ineffective, i.e. the ventilation response was
abolished. However, the changes in ventilation after mus-
cle stimulation may reappear after an effective therapeutic
treatment (Bianco et al., 2011).
One-hour of rest after the last nerve stimulation used
to evoke M- and H-waves, EIF (electrically induced muscle
fatigue) were performed. For this purpose, rhythmic muscle
contractions were produced by a neurostimulator (Grass®
S88, Quincy), which delivered, through an isolation unit, rect-
angular pulse trains to a pair of steel electrodes placed on the
muscle surface (pulse duration: 0.1 ms; frequency: 10 Hz, i.e.
five shocks in each 500 ms train; duty cycle: 500/1500 ms,
voltage range: 5­8 V). The voltage was supramaximal, i.e.
20% higher than that used to elicit a maximal twitch. Fa-
tigue was assessed from the decay of force throughout the
3-min EIF period. The strength of muscle contraction (the de-
cay of force) was measured from the beginning to the end of
this 3-min muscle electrical stimulation with a gauge strain
attached to the distal tendon (Microdynamometer S 60; Ugo
Basile Narco Biosystem). We chose to stimulate directly the
muscle because it was previously shown that muscle low
frequency stimulation is a strong activator of metabosensi-
tive afferent fibres (Darques and Jammes, 1997). Ventilatory
frequency recorded through the canula inserted into the tra-
chea was measured 2 min before EIF, during EIF and 5 min
after.
The recording protocol is summarized in Figure 1.
Muscular weight
At the end of the electrophysiological recordings, animals
were sacrificed by a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital
(Nembutal, intravenous 120 mg kg- 1). The T. anterior mus-
cles were harvested and immediately weighed on a precision
scale (OHAUS, NavigatorTM
, N30330 model). Comparisons of
muscle atrophy were performed using a muscle weight/body
weight ratio.
Histology
A 10-mm long spinal cord segment centred at the injury
site was quickly removed, fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformalde-
hyde in PBS (phosphate buffer saline) for 24 h and then
rinsed for 3 times in PBS. Subsequently, for cryoprotection
the fragment of cord was placed in 15% (w/v) sucrose in
PBS for 3 h and in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS overnight. The
sample was embedded in optimal cutting temperature com-
pound, and frozen on dry ice. The spinal cord was serially
sectioned by means of a cryostat (Carl Zeiss GmbH). Ten mi-
crometer thick serial longitudinal sections were rehydrated in
PBT [phosphate-buffered saline + 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100]
for at least 20 min and then utilized in immunofluorescence
studies.
Immunofluorescence studies
For immunofluorescence studies, the sections were rinsed
with PBS, treated with blocking solution and incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4C. Two primary antibod-
ies were used: the mouse anti-rat macrophages/monocytes
(MAB1435/CD68, 1:50, Chemicon-Millipore) to detect host
lesion response (ED1) and the polyclonal chicken anti-rat NF-
H (Neurofilament Heavy chain, AB5539, 1:600, Chemicon-
Millipore) as a marker for axons. After treatment with primary
antibodies, the sections were washed with PBS and incubated
with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor® 555 goat anti-mouse
1:200 and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-chicken 1:200, Molec-
ular Probes®, Invitrogen, Life Technologies Italia) for 2 h at
room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS, nuclei were
stained with DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Hoechst
1/1000) and then mounted using the FluorSave Reagent
(Calbiochem, Merck Chemical) and analysed by confocal mi-
croscopy. In control determinations, primary antibodies were
omitted and replaced with equivalent concentrations of un-
related IgG of the same subclass.
Assessment of myelin preservation
In order to perform a homogeneous analysis, fluoromyelin
staining (FluoroMyelin Green, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen)
was carried out on spinal cord sections from both Lesion and
Lesion + Matrix groups placed on the same coverslip. Myelin
preservation was evaluated comparing the levels of myelin
in the ventral white matter at 0.4 mm (rostral and caudal)

Figure 1 Recording protocol
(A) Fourteen weeks post-surgery, the peroneal nerve was stimulated to elicit the M- and H-waves. The influence of supraspinal descending
axons on the sub-lesional sensory-motor circuitry was examined and the reflex excitability was tested. (B) One-hour of rest after the
last nerve stimulation used to evoke M- and H-waves, EIF were performed, under regional circulatory occlusion, in order to induce
metabosensitive afferent fibre activation and subsequently a ventilation frequency and amplitude increase. Examples of M- and H-waves

ipsilaterally from the lesion epicenter in both Lesion and
Lesion + Matrix groups, since the preservation of descending
and segmental motor pathways located in the lateral and
ventral funiculi, which contains descending motor pathways,
was shown to contribute substantially to locomotor func-
tion in rat which underwent SCI; we previously reported that
the quantification of the spared ventral myelin evaluated in a
semi-thin section gave comparable results when fluoromyelin
was used (Vitellaro-Zuccarello et al., 2007). The choice
of the ventral white matter was based on the knowledge that
the reticular spinal pathway descends mostly in the ipsilateral
dorso- and ventrolateral funiculi and is directly involved in
the regulation of the movement of the animal foot (Vitellaro-
Zuccarello et al., 2007). The confocal microscope (Leica TSC2;
Leica Microsystems) images for the two groups were obtained
using the same intensity, pinhole, wavelength and thick-
ness of the acquisition. As reference, we used sections close
to the ones analysed and not treated with fluoromyelin.
Briefly, the procedure of the staining was carried out by in-
cubating the cryosections with Fluoromyelin diluted 1:300 in
PBS for 20 min; slides were then washed 3 times for 10 min
each with PBS and mounted with FluorSave (Merck, Darm-
stadt), and qualitatively and quantitatively analysed.
Estimate of the macrophages/monocytes number
at the site of lesion
ED1-positive cells were counted in transversal sections in
a region of 4 mm centred at the lesion site. As negative
reference for the confocal analysis we used a consecutive
section that was stained omitting the primary antibody anti-
rat macrophages/monocytes and replacing it with equivalent
concentrations of the unrelated IgG of the same subclass. The
zero level was adjusted on this reference and used for all the
further analysis (we used a new zero reference for each new
staining). The ED-1 positive cells present in a group of three
consecutive sections (10 m thick) were averaged, and we
repeated this count each 100 m. The total number of ED1-
positive cells was obtained integrating the average within
the volume analysed, i.e. the 4 mm around the epicenter of
the lesion (Coggeshall, 1992).

Figure 2 Locomotor evaluation according to the BBB scale
The score was plot over time after spinal hemisection for all rats in each experimental group. Twenty-one represented normal locomotion,
whereas zero represents no observable limb movement or weight support. From the 6 weeks some significant differences appeared
between the grafted and non-grafted animals; the animals from the Lesion + Matrix group showing a higher recovery. (*: Lesion group
vs Lesion + Matrix group. *, P < 0.05).
Statistical analysis
Data processing was performed using a software program
(Instat® 3.0, GraphPad software). Data were expressed
as mean +
- S.E.M. and were compared by ANOVA (paired,
two-tailed) or t tests. The groups were examined for linear
trends and post-hoc group comparisons were performed
with Student Newman Keuls multiple comparisons post-test.
Results were considered statistically significant if the P-value
fell below 0.05.
RESULTS
Behavioural study
In all animals, the severity of the spinal injuries was deter-
mined by the BBB locomotor rating scale that measured the
amount of locomotor function. The average BBB scores of the
rats at the first week were 3.3 +
- 0.75 and 0.71 +
- 0.29 in the
Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively. One week
after the lesion, the score in the Lesion + Matrix group
was statistically lower (P < 0.05) than those of the Lesion
group. Fourteen weeks after surgery, the BBB scores of the
rats were 8.66 +
- 1.25 and 14.29 +
- 1.77 in the Lesion and
Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively; the score of the im-
planted group being significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the
non-implanted one. Furthermore, the rats showed functional
improvement after injury, which is typical of animals re-
covering from spinal shock (Gale et al., 1985), reaching a
plateau for the Lesion group at the second week post-surgery
(Week + 2) but showing gradual improvement over 6 weeks
for the Lesion + Matrix group. BBB scores evolution are pre-
sented in Figure 2.
Changes H-reflex responses
Fourteen weeks post-surgery, the mean latency of the M-
wave was 2.33 +
- 0.09 ms, 2.15 +
- 0.06 and 2.38 +
- 0.08 ms for
the Control, Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively.
The mean latency measured in the Lesion group was sig-
nificantly (P < 0.05) lower than the mean latencies found
in the two other experimental groups. The latency of the
H-reflex was 5.35 +
- 0.14, 5.96 +
- 0.09 and 5.71 +
- 0.13 ms in
the Control, Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively.
The mean latency measured in the Lesion group was signifi-
cantly higher than the mean latencies found in the Control
(P < 0.01) and Lesion + Matrix (P < 0.05) groups. Although
higher than the Control group, the mean latency of the
Lesion + Matrix group was found not significantly different.
H-reflex recorded at 0.3 Hz stimulation rate was
used to calculate the baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio. Animals
from the Lesion group had a significant (P < 0.05) lower
baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio (0.36 +
- 0.03) than Control
(0.48 +
- 0.14) and Lesion + Matrix (0.48 +
- 0.06) groups.

Figure 3 H-reflex rate sensitivity
At the 14th week post-surgery, frequency-dependent values of H-reflexes were assessed. The Hmax
/Mmax
ratio at 0.3 Hz frequency was
assigned as 100% response. At 5 and 10 Hz stimulation, ratios of Control and Lesion + Matrix groups were statistically similar and the
decrease was statistically significant, contrary to Lesion group. (*, Control and Lesion + Matrix groups against 100%; #, Control group
against Lesion group; , Lesion group against Lesion + Matrix group. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; #, P < 0.05; ##, P < 0.01; , P < 0.01).
No difference was found between the Control and
Lesion + Matrix groups.
Given that Hmax
/Mmax
ratio was constant across groups
at 0.3 Hz frequency, the frequency-dependent value of H-
reflexes was assessed (Figure 3). The Hmax
/Mmax
ratio at
0.3 Hz frequency was assigned as 100% response. As the
frequency of stimulation was increased to 1 Hz the ratio
slightly decreased for the Control (94.53 +
- 3.82%) and sli-
ghtly increased for both Lesion (106.06 +
- 4.49%) and
Lesion + Matrix (105.40 +
- 7.96%) groups. These changes
were not significantly different. Moreover, no statistical dif-
ference was found between groups. At 5 Hz stimulation, a
significant (P < 0.05) decrease was observed in both Con-
trol (76.63 +
- 8.06%) and Lesion + Matrix (87.96 +
- 8.16%)
groups while no significant difference was shown in Le-
sion (113.07 +
- 7.56%) group. Comparison between groups
indicated a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the
Lesion and the Control groups. At 10 Hz stimulation,
the ratios of Control (58.56 +
- 6.29%) and Lesion + Matrix
(82.38 +
- 7.92%) groups decreased significantly (P < 0.01
and P < 0.05, respectively). Although higher, the ratio
measured in the Lesion + Matrix group was similar to
those of the Control group. In the Lesion group the
ratio (117.29 +
- 10.25%) increased significantly (P < 0.05).
The Control and Lesion + Matrix groups were significantly
(P < 0.01) lower from the Lesion group.
Therefore in the Control animals, the Hmax
/Mmax
ra-
tio steadily decreased with increasing stimulus frequency.
However, after SCI, the rate depression property of the H-
reflex was insensitive to stimulus frequency in the Lesion
group, as indicated by the higher percent of Control and
Lesion + Matrix groups Hmax
/Mmax
ratio values.
Measures of the H-reflex responses to repetitive stimu-
lation at 10 Hz are shown on Figure 4. Data indicated that
H-reflex responses were markedly reduced (P < 0.05) by the
second and subsequent stimuli (normalized to 1st response) in
the Control group. This rate-sensitive depression was absent
in rats from injured groups and there was no statistical dif-
ference between the Lesion and the Lesion + Matrix groups.
Furthermore, a significant difference (P < 0.05) was found
between the Control group and the two others for the 3rd,
4th and 5th responses.
Muscle force, weight and ventilatory response to
fatigue
After 3-min stimulation (EIF) of the ipsilateral side of
the spinal lesion, measurement of the decay of force
throughout the 3-min EIF period indicated a force
loss of -50.04 +
- 2.93% in the Control group against
-69.05 +
- 3.14% and -65.17 +
- 4.12% in the Lesion
and Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively. The Lesion and
Lesion + Matrix groups presented the greater force loss
(P < 0.01) compared with the Control group. No significant
difference was observed between the Lesion and the
Lesion + Matrix groups.
The relative weight of the T. anterior muscle markedly de-
creased on the side of the SCI; the Lesion (1.42 +
- 0.05 g kg- 1)

At 14th week post-surgery, H-reflex responses at 10 Hz-train stimulation were markedly reduced by the second and subsequent stimuli
(normalized to 1st response) in Control groups. This depression was absent in rats from Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups. (*: Control

- 0.05 g kg- 1) groups show-
ing a significantly (P < 0.01) lower muscle weight than
the Control (1.66 +
- 0.06 g kg- 1) group. Between the op-
erated groups, the relative weight of the T. anterior mus-
cle was not different. There was also no difference between
the relative weight of the muscle on the unlesioned side
(Control: 1.68 +
- 0.06 g kg- 1; Lesion: 1.65 +
- 0.06 g kg- 1;
Lesion + Matrix: 1.67 +
- 0.06 g kg- 1).
Air flow movements, recorded through the canula in-
serted into the trachea, represents the ventilatory ac-
tivity for each animal (Figure 5). The ventilatory activ-
ity significantly increased by + 7.50 +
- 1.18% (P < 0.001)
and + 7.98 +
- 1.95% (P < 0.001) in the Control and
Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively. No significant venti-
latory increase ( + 0.07 +
- 1.15%) was observed in the Le-
sion group after muscle fatigue. Inter-group comparison
revealed no significant difference between Control and
Lesion + Matrix groups. However, a highly significant differ-
ence (P < 0.001) between Lesion and the two other groups
was found.
Morphological evaluation
Analysis of the lesion cavity directly from the collected slices
indicated that the lesion extent was comparable in both
hemisected groups. Macrophages/monocytes infiltration at
the site of injury was investigated by confocal quantita-
tive estimation of the number of ED-1 immunostained cells
in the examined 4000 m. The number of ED-1 positive
cells at the lesion site resulted significantly (P < 0.05) lower
in Lesion (827 +
- 201) than in Lesion + Matrix (1214 +
- 244)
group. Some ED-1 positive cells penetrated into the ma-
trix, but most of them were located in prevalence at the
edge of the injury (Figure 6). A similar outcome was ob-
served when neutrophil infiltration was investigated (re-
sults not shown). Numerous NF-H-positive axonal profiles
were observed at the edge and throughout the matrix
(Figure 7).
An important pathway in eliciting locomotion is the retic-
ulospinal tract that descends mainly in the ipsilateral dorso-
and ventrolateral funiculi. By electrophysiological studies, it
was shown its function in the coordination of rhythmic step-
ping movements (Mori et al., 1998; Ballermann and Fouad,
2006). In this region, myelin preservation was studied by
confocal analysis (details in the Materials and Methods sec-
tion). FluoroMyelin stained cryosections indicated a much
higher number of globular bodies (degenerated myelin) in
both rostral and caudal cord samples of Lesion group com-
pared with Lesion + Matrix animals (Figure 8). Quantification
of retrogradely preserved myelin in rostral cord sections of
the Lesion group resulted significantly lower (P < 0.05) than
in the Lesion + Matrix group. Moreover, the same analysis
performed caudally to the lesion site showed that the pro-
tective effects of the matrix were significantly much higher,
with a preservation stating to the 35 +
- 6% (P < 0.001) (Fig-
ure 8).

pHPMA in repair of transected spinal cord
Figure 5 Ventilatory activity after a 3-min electromyostimulation
The T. anterior muscle of the left side (ipsilateral side of the lesion for the Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups) was stimulated.
The ventilatory activity significantly (***, P < 0.001) increased in the Control and Lesion + Matrix groups, respectively. No significant
ventilatory increase was observed in the Lesion groups after muscle fatigue. Inter-group comparison reveals a highly significant difference
between Lesion group and the two other groups (###, P < 0.001 for the Control group and , P < 0.05 for Lesion + Matrix group).
DISCUSSION
The present study shows, in an animal model of spinal cord
hemisection, that a biocompatible macroporous pHPMA is
a matrix that can (1) improve locomotor function based on
BBB locomotor rating scale, (2) support axonal and myelin
preservation, (3) improve respiratory response to electrically
induced muscular fatigue and (4) restores H-reflex evoked
response.
Compared with the Lesion alone group in which (1) the
BBB score increases only during the first two weeks post-
injury and reach a plateau, (2) the respiratory and the H-
reflex response are not improved, there is no doubt that the
hydrogel brings a suitable environment that allows a better
functional recovery.
Improved locomotor activity
We report in the current study that there was a significant
improvement of the locomotion and the activity of the sen-
sorimotor loops after reconstructive surgery of the lesion
using pHPMA hydrogel implants. The functional loss due to
the spinal cord hemisection was maintained throughout the
entire time of the study in both groups. However, contrary to
the Lesion group that reached a plateau at the second week
post-surgery suggesting typical reorganization observed af-
ter an SCI (Gale et al., 1985), the Lesion + Matrix group pre-
sented a functional improvement until the sixth week. As in
our study, previous experiments showed that after a spinal
hemisection at the T9­T10 level a spontaneous locomotor re-
covery was observed (Teng et al., 2002). However, in a model
of T8 dorsal hemisection that interrupts several pathways in-
cluding the corticospinal and the raphespinal tracts, it was
showed at 6 weeks after implantation of a biodegradable
hydrogel (acrylated PLA-b-PEG-b-PLA) that the BBB score
reached higher values (Piantino et al., 2006). Improvement
of the functional motor recovery after pHPMA implantation
was also observed following both a T8­T9 compression in rat
(Woerly et al., 2001a) and a complete spinal cord transaction
in cat (Woerly et al., 2001b; Woerly et al., 2004). In addition,
motor improvements were also reported after implantation
of pHPMA hydrogel containing RGD (Woerly et al., 2001c;
Hejcl et al., 2010).
The functional outcomes after SCI were enhanced
in the animals that were treated with a hydrogel suggest-
ing the effectiveness of hydrogel technology.
Improved response to fatigue
Here we show an abolishment of the adaptive ventilatory
response after a hemitransection on the ipsilateral side and a
recovery (i.e. increase in ventilation rate after muscle stimu-
lation) in implanted rats. As we reported previously in a bilat-
eral T10 spinal cord compression model (Bianco et al., 2011),
the results obtained in the Lesion + Matrix group indicate a
more effective recovery of the neural mechanisms involved
in cardio-respiratory adjustments to muscular activity that
can be initiated by the T. anterior stimulation (Decherchi
et al., 2007). The afferent arm of this reflex is composed
of thinly myelinated group III and unmyelinated group IV
sensitive fibres that inform, throughout the spinal pathway,
the medullary respiratory centres of the muscle contrac-
tion rate. More precisely, these sensitive fibres make their
first synapse on spinoreticular tracts neurons in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord (Mitchell et al., 1977; Mitchell et al.,
1983; Iwamoto et al., 1984; Iwamoto et al., 1985; Kozelka
and Wurster, 1985; Bauer et al., 1989). Part of the ascending
projections arising from the dorsal horn cells excites neu-
rons in the cardiovascular control centre of the ventrolat-
eral medulla that in return excite sympathetic preganglionic
neurons located in the intermediolateral area of the spinal

suggested, excites other subnucleus of the NTS (nucleus trac-
tus solitarii) projecting on respiratory nuclei that could be
seen as premotor respiratory neurons (Decherchi et al., 2007).
Our present results strongly suggest that when pH-
PMA hydrogel is implanted in lesioned spinal cord cavity,
there might be a sensori-motor reorganization that allows
the transmission of the sensory messages from the sub-
to the supra-lesional spinal cord. This improvement may have
an anatomical basis, i.e.: axonal regrowth throughout the le-
sion, myelination of the newly formed axons, synapse devel-
opment (newly formed contacts between subpopulations of
neurons) and/or reorganization of segmental, intersegmen-
tal and suprasegmental axonal circuitries. Previous studies
showed that pHPMA hydrogel enabled the integration of
the CNS cellular component into the lesion and promoted
tissue restoration of the spinal cord (Woerly et al., 1999,
2001a). This reparative neo-histogenic process was made pos-
sible because the polymer gel established a stable structural
three-dimensional continuity across the lesion cavity that
served as a growth template that facilitated tissue morpho-
genesis, organization (infiltration of host cells within the
pore structure of the gel, formation of tissue trabeculae)
and axonal growth within the polymer implant (these axons
were myelinated by ectopic Schwann cell that may have mi-
grated into the lesion/implantation site). Thus, it had been
suggested that pHPMA hydrogel had a strong stimulating
effect on neurons and Schwann cells activity as well as sup-
porting revascularization of the lesion site and having an
apparent protective effect against Wallerian degeneration

pHPMA hydrogel may have therapeutic interest in the repair
of spinal cord lesion (Woerly et al., 1990, 1996a, 1996b) com-
pared with various materials used to experimentally bridge
the spinal cord lesion such as collagen matrix (Marchand
and Woerly, 1990), guidance channels (tubes or cylinders) of
poly(acrylonitrile-vinylchloride) (Xu et al., 1995), polycarbon-
ate (Montgomery et al., 1996), poly(-hydroxyacids) (Gautier
et al., 1998; Oudega et al., 2001), silicone (Borgens, 1999),
polyethylene glycol (Shi et al., 1999), poly(lactic acid) (Hur-
tado et al., 2011) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (Moore
et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009).
H-reflex responses
Our study indicates that at the 14th week after hemisec-
tion of the spinal cord, the stimulation rate-sensitive H-
reflex depression was absent in the Lesion group contrary
to the Control and Lesion + Matrix groups in which the H-
reflex responses were markedly reduced by the second and
subsequent stimuli (normalized to 1st response). Our results
also indicated that the rate sensitivity of the H-wave in the
Lesion + Matrix group was close to control values. However,
the H-reflex depression was absent at 10 Hz-train stimulation
in the Lesion and Lesion + Matrix groups.
We interpret these changes as consistent with the view
that implanted pHPMA induced a beneficial network reorga-
nization that allows the transmission of the motor messages
from the supra- to the sub-lesional spinal cord and that
SCI resulted in a marked alteration in the distribution of
background excitation and inhibition, producing changes in
motoneuron excitability.
It was previously described that SCI in mammals are fol-
lowed by a `spinal shock' period with muscle paralysis, flaccid
muscle tone, and loss of tendon reflexes below the level of
injury. Several weeks after injury, a spastic syndrome de-
velops showing exaggerated tendon jerks, increased mus-
cle tone, and muscle spasm (Hiersemenzel et al., 2000). This
second step has been explained as a result of cortical and
subcortical release of spinal cord reflex circuits connecting
muscle and skin sensory afferents with intact interneurons
and motoneurons (Engberg et al., 1968). Corticospinal pro-
jections from primary, premotor and supplementary motor
areas have been implicated in the modulation of spinal re-
flexes by mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition onto affer-
ent sensory projections and their synapses with interneurons
and motoneurons (Petersen et al., 1998). The cortically driven
regulatory activity ceases when descending pathways are in-
terrupted by the injury, thus giving rise to enhanced activity
of spinal segmental reflexes under the injury level. The SCI-
induced changes in the H-reflex by (i) increasing the H-wave
amplitude and H/M ratio at the baseline stimulation and (ii)
reducing rate depression upon low-frequency stimulation.
Diverse mechanisms may be involved in the post-traumatic
H-reflex enhancement such as increase in motoneuron ex-
citability due to reappearance of large persistent inward
ionic currents, decrease of presynaptic inhibition of Ia af-
ferents, enhanced post-activation depression of transmitter
release in Ia terminals and reduced reciprocal inhibition by
Ia terminals from antagonist muscles (Hultborn, 2003; Li and
Bennett, 2003; Li et al., 2004; Frigon and Rossignol, 2006).
It is commonly described that short-term alteration in reflex
excitability, occurring within hours and days after SCI, can be
explained by loss of supraspinal and propriospinal inputs, by
alterations in receptors and channels in motoneurons and
by presynaptic terminals modulating neuronal excitability
and transmitter release (Little et al., 1999; Hultborn, 2003;
Frigon and Rossignol, 2006). In contrast, long-term changes,
requiring weeks or even months, are generally associated with
structural synaptic plasticity, i.e. axonal sprouting and for-
mation of new synaptic contacts between primary afferents
or spared descending axons, on the one hand, and interneu-
rons and motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord, on the other
hand.
An unexpected observation in rats has previously been
reported (Lee et al., 2005): rats with mild contusion injury,
and thus fairly good functional recovery, display a decrease
in the rate depression of the H-reflex, i.e. becomes more ab-
normal between the 1st and the 8th post-operative weeks.
In contrast, the same authors reported that the depression
increases, i.e. becomes more `normal', in rats with complete
transection of the spinal cord, an injury leading to poor func-
tional outcome. The authors concluded that the H-reflex

Figure 8 Myelin preservation
Green FluoroMyelin staining showed globular bodies (degenerated myelin) both rostrally (R) and caudally (C) to the lesion (L) epicenter.
The extent of such degeneration was much reduced when matrix was applied. The higher (P < 0.05) sparing effect of matrix compared
with injured spinal without matrix was particularly evident in rostral sections (R). Scale bar: 150 m.
rate depression depends of the type and severity of the
SCI (contusion against complete transection). They suggested
that the H-reflex recovers some sensitivity to afferent stimu-
lus frequency in the absence of any supraspinal connections.
However, when supraspinal connections are partially spared,
there is a further loss in sensitivity of the H-reflex to afferent
stimulation frequency. After a complete spinal cord transec-
tion an increase in GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and
GABA (-amino-butyric acid) is observed (Smith et al., 1976;
Tillakaratne et al., 2000; Tillakaratne et al., 2002). Since presy-
naptic inhibition of Ia afferents is GABA-mediated, increased
GABA could explain the higher depression rate observed over
time after transection. More recently Rudomin and Schmidt
(1999), Lee et al. (2009) also showed that better functional
recovery in mice is associated with enhanced H-reflex re-
sponses, an unexpected finding regarding the general view
that hyperexcitability is a negative pathophysiological factor.
These authors thus suggested that reduction in the rate sen-
sitivity of the H-reflex provides functional advantages after
incomplete SCI (compression) in mice.
The Lesion group presents the lowest baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio 14 weeks after the hemisection. This result was related
to a decrease in H-wave amplitude whereas the M-wave am-
plitude was maintained in any of our experimental groups.
The presence of a decrease in the baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio
14 weeks after the SCI seems to contradict previous reports.
If baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio was solely influenced by tonic
inhibition from supraspinal pathways, then we should have
observed an elevated baseline ratio if these descending path-
ways were interrupted. One previous study has reported an
increase in the H-wave amplitude during the first couple of
days after partial thoracic transection (80­95%) and a re-
turn to pre-injury values by the 3-4 days after injury (Chen
et al., 2001). The authors suggested that plasticity induced by
the presence of spared supraspinal or intraspinal pathways
may explain these results after SCI. These results have also

pHPMA in repair of transected spinal cord
been attributed to changes in motoneuron number and/or
morphology after SCI (Friedman et al., 1981; Zengel et al.,
1983).
Although the deleterious consequences of an SCI can be
observed many months after the trauma, we only analysed
the short-term (14 weeks) effect of spinal cord hemisection
at a thoracic level. The abnormal low baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio observed in our Lesion group may reflect a motoneuron
loss and/or changes in excitability properties in a context of
severe SCI in which few descending axons were poorly or
not functional. In the Lesion + Matrix group, the higher ratio
(similar to the Control group ratio) may be explained by the
beneficial effect of the implanted hydrogel, which may limit
the glial scar formation, reform the tissue structure and help
promote axonal regeneration across or around the lesion
site. In the context of neuroplasticity alone, a decrease in
secondary damage due to a less severe inflammatory reaction
in the Lesion + Matrix group may also explain the observed
functional improvement.
Several situations have been described in the literature.
For example, a longitudinal study performed in tetraplegic
patients reported an elevated T. anterior Hmax
/Mmax
ratio as-
sociated with a decrease in M-wave amplitude (Hiersemenzel
et al., 2000) while it was reported an increased ratio until 1
month after complete thoracic transection in the rat (Valero-
Cabre et al., 2004). However, contrary to our study and others
(Lee et al., 2005) in which only the peroneal branch was stim-
ulated, they obtained their electrophysiological responses by
stimulating the entire sciatic nerve which undoubtedly stim-
ulated many muscles of the hindlimb that induced reciprocal
facilitations between different muscle groups, as it was re-
ported in SCI patients (Crone et al., 2003; Xia and Rymer,
2005). Some evidence indicated a correlation between 5-
HT-IR and baseline Hmax
/Mmax
ratio after incomplete SCI
suggesting that spared descending serotonergic fibres may
be involved (e.g. sprouting) in the recruitment of more mo-
toneurons (Holmes et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2005). In our model,
we can hypothesize that there is virtually no local serotonin
as previously described after complete spinal cord transec-
tion (Schmidt and Jordan, 2000) and that the recovery of the
Hmax
/Mmax
ratio observed in the Lesion + Matrix group was
mainly due to plasticity of spared descending pathways, or a
regrowth of injured axons through or around the hydrogel, or
changes in the motoneurons properties and 5-HT receptors.
Axonal and myelin preservation
In this study, we confirm that the application of this type of
matrix promotes axonal regrowth mainly supported at the
edge of the matrix. Here we observed a higher presence
of macrophages/monocytes (ED-1-positives cells), that may
suggest a correlation between such axonal sprouting and
the higher number of macrophages/monocytes. The higher
number of ED-1-positive cells might be due to some reten-
tion action by the matrix. It is well known that the number
of macrophages/monocytes has a peak around a week after
spinal cord lesioning, and that later it decreases (Bottai et al.,
2010). It is possible that the higher number observed in the
Lesion + Matrix group might be due to a slower decrease
compared with Lesion group rather than to an attractive
action by the matrix itself. In addition, we show that matrix
greatly counteracts the degeneration of myelin both rostrally
and caudally to the lesion. The improved myelin preservation
suggests a neuroprotective action by the matrix that seems to
reduce the extent of secondary degeneration induced by the
lesion. Such preservation occurs in the ventral white matter,
where the reticular spinal pathway descends. This pathway
regulates the movement of the rodent foot. Previous studies
showed that pHPMA hydrogel implanted into the transected
or compressed spinal cord cavity promoted the formation of
a replacement tissue with histotypic characteristics of the
host (Woerly et al., 2001a, 2001b). Indeed, the hydrogel that
formed a stable bridge between the cord stumps was infil-
trated by a reparative tissue composed of glial cells, capillary
vessels, newly formed neurons presumably from precursor
cells of the ependyma and/or migrating neurons and re-
generating afferent and efferent axons (Woerly et al., 1998,
1999, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c).
Conclusion
This work demonstrates that acute pHPMA hydrogel implan-
tation into the hemisected T10 rat spinal cord induced loco-
motor and neurophysiological improvements. This recovery
might be due either to a more suitable environment for re-
generating axons and/or to a prevention of secondary injury
and glial scar formation inducing higher neuroplasticity. The
sub-lesional sensori-motor loops of grafted animals seem
to be partially once again regulated by supra-lesional in-
fluences even though H-reflex excitability changes are still
present 14 weeks after the SCI. Further studies are needed to
determine which mechanisms are involved in the spinal cord
plasticity after pHPMA hydrogel implantation. This study pro-
vides new insight into the concept that biomaterial technol-
ogy constitutes a promising approach to repair spinal cord
injuries.
