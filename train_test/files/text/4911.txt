Abstract
Background: Preventive medications for dialysis-requiring congestive heart failure (CHF) in non-dialysis Japanese
patients with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) are unknown. Our aim was to explore which CKD medication was
associated with a reduced prevalence of dialysis-requiring CHF in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.
Methods: The present multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study examined the association between CKD
medications and the prevalence of dialysis-requiring CHF in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.
Results: There were 1536 Japanese Stage 5 CKD patients who satisfied our inclusion criteria. We had 309 (20.1%)
patients whom had developed dialysis-requiring CHF and 940 patients (60.8%) whom had been using angiotensin-II
receptor blockers (ARBs) before initiating dialysis. In our multivariate analysis, only ARB use was significantly associated
with a lower risk of CHF (Odds ratio (OR): 0.680, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.516­0.897; p = 0.0064), of the CKD
treatments examined in this study.
Conclusions: We found that ARB use during the pre-dialysis period is associated with a lower prevalence of CHF in
the non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD, suggesting a possible prevention of dialysis-requiring CHF by ARBs,
in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.

Introduction
The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is esti-
mated to be 8­16% worldwide,1 and the risk of death or
cardiovascular events increases with increasing CKD
stages.1­4 In the early-to-moderate CKD stages, inhibition
of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been
shown to provide both renal and cardiac protection.5­10
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are
used worldwide to treat hypertension, CKD, and cardiovas-
cular disease.11­15 A recent meta-analysis has revealed that
ACEIs reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality, cardio-
vascular mortality, and major cardiovascular events, includ-
ing congestive heart failure (CHF) in early-to-moderate
stage CKD and in patients with diabetes mellitus; although
angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) use do not reduce
the incidence of these events, except for CHF.16
Hsu et al.26 report that ACEI, but not ARB, used effec-
tively prevent mortality and end-stage renal disease pro-
gression, while ARB use only decreases hospitalization
due to CHF; however, approximately 5­20% of patients
cannot tolerate ACEIs, because of dry cough and the other
adverse effects (e.g. angioedema, hypotension, hyper-
kalemia or renal dysfunction).17­20 Unfortunately, this per-
sistent dry cough is highly prevalent in the East Asian
populations21,22; therefore, many East Asian patients must
be switched from ACEI to ARB, as an alternative treat-
ment. Recently, Nishio et al.23 reported 2 gene polymor-
phisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion/
insertion (ACE D/I) and bradykinin B2 receptor -58T/C
contribute to the risk ofACEI-related cough in EastAsians,
but a negative association between the ACE I/D polymor-
phism and ACEI-related cough was observed in
Caucasians. Thus, the effect of ARB should be clarified in
Japanese CKD patients, which motivated us to explore the
effect of ARBs in dialysis-requiring CHF in late-stage
CKD patients in Japan.
To date, preventive effects of the medications used for
CKD on patients with dialysis-requiring CHF is not well
understood.24­26 In addition, few clinical reports focus on
patients with Stage 5 CKD, which is defined by an esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 15 mL/
min/1.73m2. A recent study reports that ACEI or ARB use
in non-dialysis patients with Stage 5 CKD is associated
with a reduced risk of long-term dialysis or death,27 but no
information was provided regarding dialysis-requiring
CHF patients.
Among the uremic symptoms that require renal replace-
ment therapy (RRT), CHF significantly predicts the inci-
dence of cardiac events and mortality in end-stage kidney
disease.28,29 Unfortunately, no effective preventative treat-
ment for CHF has been definitively described for patients
with Stage 5 CKD. Furthermore, the ability of ARB to pre-
vent CHF (a major reason for initiating RRT) has not been
assessed in patients with Stage 5 CKD. Thus, we evaluated
the associations between various medications (including
ACEI and ARB) and the prevalence of dialysis-requiring
CHF in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.
Our objective was to explore which CKD medication
would be associated with a reduced prevalence of dialysis-
requiring CHF, in non-dialysis Japanese patients with
Stage 5 CKD.
Methods
Study design
This study used a cross-sectional, observational multicenter
design, and included 3447 Japanese patients across nine
Japanese institutions, whom had initiated RRT between 1
January 2006 and 31 October 2013. All participating insti-
tutions belonged to the Japanese Study Group forAssessing
Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy (J-START), and
these institutions served as the primary pre-dialysis source
of information, for patients with end-stage kidney disease.
All the J-START members are nephrologists who have
been certified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology and
the Japanese Society of Dialysis Therapy. We collected
clinical information and hematological data at the institu-
tional level, immediately before the patient's first hemodi-
alysis session, according to the J-START database sheet
(Microsoft Excel). Each patient's information was only
labeled with the institution and patient number, to protect
their privacy. This study was performed in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee for clini-
cal research of Jikei University School of Medicine
approved this study (permission number 25-343).
To explore the association between CKD medications
and dialysis-requiring CHF, the following inclusion crite-
ria were selected:
1. Only Japanese Stage 5 CKD patients who were fol-
lowed up over 3 months and received a stable pre-
scription > 3 months by a nephrologist, to exclude
emergent initiation of dialysis, for AKI; and
2. Those with patient records with complete data,
regarding the following factors: age, gender, pres-
ence of diabetic kidney disease, reasons (uremic
symptoms) for initiating RRT, history of ischemic
heart disease (IHD), duration of nephrologist fol-
low-up, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and
laboratory data (hemoglobin, albumin, urea nitro-
gen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, cor-
rected calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein
(CRP) and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).
As a result, 1911 patients were excluded from the anal-
ysis, due to having Stage 1­4 CKD (45 patients), being 
19 years old (3 patients), having an uncertain history of
IHD (164 patients) and comorbidity (29 patients), having a
follow-up period of < 3 months or of unknown length (819
patients), lack of data regarding medication use
Ikeda et al. 1177
in the previous 3 months (254 patients) and insufficient
laboratory data (624 patients). Therefore, among the 3474
patients whom we evaluated, there were 1536 Japanese
patients satisfying our inclusion criteria whom were
included in our analysis (Figure 1). Compared to the
included patients, the excluded patients whom had < 3
months of nephrologist follow-up had a significantly
higher prevalence of dialysis-requiring CHF (35.8% ver-
sus 20.1%; p < 0.0001), a lower prevalence of diabetic kid-
ney disease (35.9% versus 43.3%; p = 0.0024), a lower
frequency of ARB use (36.5% versus 60.8%; p < 0.0001),
and higher levels of CRP (3.17 ± 4.96 mg/dL versus 1.27 ±
3.06 mg/dL; p < 0.0001). We observed no significant dif-
ferences regarding age, gender, eGFR and history of IHD,
when the included and excluded patients were compared.
The eGFR was calculated using the new Japanese equa-
tions,30 for men (1) and for women (2):
Men: eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 194 × Cr -1.094 ×
 age -0.287
Women: eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 194 ×
Cr -1.094 × age -0.287 (× 0.739)
We used a modified version of Framingham heart fail-
ure diagnostic criteria to confirm the diagnosis of CHF.31 A
diagnosis of CHF was made according to the presence of
orthopnea, sudden weight gain and radiography findings
(enlarged pulmonary vessels, alveolar edema and pleural
effusion); and these findings were rapidly resolved after
the first hemodialysis session.
We also collected information regarding the patients'
medication use before starting dialysis. The specific medi-
cations that we evaluated were erythropoietin receptor
stimulating agents (ESAs), ACEIs, ARBs, calcium chan-
nel blockers (CCBs), loop diuretics, other anti-hyperten-
sive agents (alpha-blockers and/or beta-blockers, and/or
other hypertensive drugs), Vitamin D receptor activators
(VDRAs), calcium carbonate (CaCO3
) and AST-120
(Kureha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is an orally adminis-
tered spherical carbon adsorbent that can adsorb various
small molecule uremic toxins.32
Variables.The primary outcome was the prevalence of
CHF at dialysis initiation, and the predictor variable was
the CKD medications used before dialysis initiation. We
also selected the following explanatory variables: gender;
age; comorbid diabetes mellitus; medical history of IHD;
the nephrology follow-up period; systolic and diastolic
blood pressure; use of ARBs, ACEIs, CCBs, other antihy-
pertensive drugs, loop diuretics, ESAs, VDRAs, CaCO3
,
or AST-120; eGFR; serum uric acid; serum potassium;
serum chloride; serum corrected calcium; serum phospho-
rus; serum intact PTH; serum albumin; and hemoglobin
concentration.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 9.0 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data were expressed as the
mean±SDornumber(percentage)ofpatients.Comparisons
across the various groups were performed using the Pearson
chi-squared test for categorical data and the Dunnett test for
continuous data. All tests were two-tailed, and a p < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Factors that were
associated with CHF during the univariate analysis were
subsequently included in a multivariate model. Multivariate
logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the

covariates that were associated with the development of
dialysis-requiring CHF. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs
were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic
regression models for the factors that were significantly
associated with CHF. We used Forrest plots to summarize
the results of the logistic regression analysis, and Microsoft
Excel to plot the 95% CI range on the log scale Forrest plots.
Results
Reasons for starting dialysis
Figure 2 shows the reasons (uremic symptoms) for initiating
dialysis. Among the 1536 Japanese patients, 309 patients
(20.1%) started RRT due to developing CHF, 230 patients
(15.0%) started RRT due to gastro-intestinal symptoms, 198
patients (12.9%) started RRT due to uncontrollable edema,
77 patients (5.0%) started RRT due to other symptoms (ane-
mia, neurological or other symptoms), and 722 patients
(47.0%) underwent planned RRT (with no symptoms).
Comparison of patients presenting with or
without CHF
The patients'characteristics and laboratory test results from
immediately before starting dialysis are shown in Table 1,
along with a comparison of patients with and without CHF.
Compared to the patients without CHF, the patients whom
presented with CHF were significantly older (66.7 ± 12.9
years, versus 68.9 ± 13.4 years; p = 0.0092), had a higher
frequency of diabetic kidney disease (40.1% versus 55.3%;
p < 0.0001), a higher frequency of a medical history of IHD
(16.3% versus 28.5%; p < 0.0001), a lower diastolic blood
pressure (77.6 ± 13.8 mmHg versus 75.3 ± 16.5 mmHg; p =
0.0123), and a shorter follow-up period (3.83 ± 3.73 years
versus 3.14 ± 3.11 years; p = 0.0028).
In addition, the patients who presented with CHF used
loop diuretics significantly more frequently (66.5% versus
82.5%; p < 0.0001), and used ARBs (62.2% versus 56.0%;
p = 0.0460), CaCO3
(36.3% versus 26.9%; p = 0.0019) and
VDRAs (27.5% versus 17.8%; p = 0.0005) less frequently,
when compared to the patients without CHF; however, we
observed no significant associations between CHF devel-
opment and the use of ACEIs, CCBs, ESAs, AST-120 or
other hypertensive drugs.
The patients who started RRT due to CHF development
also had significantly higher levels of CRP (0.94 ± 2.50
mg/dl versus 2.60 ± 4.43 mg/dl; p < 0.0001), eGFR (5.04
± 1.77 mL/min/1.73m2 versus 5.84 ± 2.32 mL/min/1.73m2;
p < 0.0001), uric acid (8.43 ± 2.18 g/dL versus 8.78 ± 2.43
g/dL; p = 0.0122), corrected calcium (8.51 ± 0.92 mg/L
versus 8.67 ± 0.97 mg/L; p = 0.0062) and cardiothoracic
ratio (CTR) (53.2 ± 6.1% versus 58.0 ± 6.7%; p < 0.0001),
as well as significantly lower levels of hemoglobin (8.83 ±
1.47 g/dL versus 8.54 ± 1.51g/dL; p = 0.0023), serum cre-
atinine (9.57 ± 3.18 mg/dL versus 8.54 ± 3.06 mg/dL; p <
0.0001), potassium (4.63 ± 0.82 mEq/L versus 4.50 ± 0.86
mEq/L; p = 0.0174), chloride (105.2 ± 6.0 mEq/L versus
104.0 ± 6.2 mEq/L; p = 0.0018) and serum albumin (3.30
± 0.58 g/dL versus 3.03 ± 0.57 g/dL; p < 0.0001). There
were no significant differences between the two groups,
regarding gender, systolic blood pressure, urea nitrogen,
sodium, phosphorus and intact PTH.
Association between various risk factors and
the prevalence of CHF
As is shown in Table 2, univariate and multivariate-
adjusted logistic regression analysis were used to assess
the independent association between CHF development
and medications or the other clinical parameters. The pri-
mary outcome was the prevalence of CHF at dialysis ini-
tiation, the predictor variable was ARB use, and the
covariates were determined according to their univariate
relationship or importance within the explanatory varia-
bles. In the univariate analysis, older age, shorter nephrol-
ogist follow-up, lower diastolic blood pressure, and higher
levels of corrected calcium were risk factors for

dialysis-requiring CHF, although they were not independent
risk factors after the multivariate-adjusted logistic regression
analysis. VDRA and CaCO3
use were also associated with
dialysis-requiring CHF in the univariate model, although
these associations disappeared after adjusting for intact PTH,
corrected calcium and the nephrologist follow-up period.
The multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis
revealed that, among all the medications that we exam-
ined, only ARB use was independently associated with a
significantly reduced risk of dialysis-requiring CHF (OR:
0.680; 95% CI: 0.516­0.897; p = 0.0064). Though ACEI
use was not independently associated with dialysis-requir-
ing CHF (OR: 0.704; 95% CI: 0.476­1.022; p = 0.0656), a
nonsignificant CHF-preventive tendency was observed. In
contrast, no significant reduction in the risk of dialysis-
requiring CHF was observed for the use of: VDRA,
CaCO3
, ESA, AST-120, CCB or the other hypertensive
drugs. A significant positive correlation was also con-
firmed between CHF development and loop diuretic use
(OR: 1.872; 95% CI: 1.336­2.658; p = 0.0002). Comorbid
diabetic kidney disease (p = 0.0036), a history of IHD (p =
0.0004), high levels of serum CRP (p < 0.00001) and
eGFR (p = 0.0002), low levels of serum albumin (p =
0.0090) and hemoglobin (p = 0.0250) were also independ-
ent risk factors for dialysis-requiring CHF.
Comparison of patients' characteristics between
ARB users and non-users
As onlyARB was significantly associated with a decreased
risk of dialysis-requiring CHF, we compared the charac-
teristics of ARB users (940 patients (60.8%)) with ARB

non-users (606 patients (39.2%)), to confirm whether any
significant differences existed. As we show in Table 3,
compared with non-users of ARB, the ARB users were sig-
nificantly younger (66.5 ± 12.8 years versus 68.0 ± 12.4
years; p = 0.0243); had a higher frequency of diabetic kid-
ney disease (47.1% versus 36.8%; p < 0.0001); had a
shorter nephrologist follow-up period (3.48 ± 3.31 years,
versus 4.03 ± 4.04 years; p = 0.0030); and had a higher
frequency of CCB use (79.6% versus 70.1%; p < 0.0001),
ACEI use (18.2% versus 13.2%; p < 0.0094) and other
hypertensive drug use (48.3% versus 41.4%; p < 0.008).
ARB users had significantly higher levels of chloride
(105.5 ± 5.8 mEq/L versus 104.1 ± 6.3 mEq/L; p < 0.0001),
systolic blood pressure (153.6 ± 24.2 mmHg versus 149.5 ±
25.7 mmHg; p < 0.0016) and CTR (53.9 ± 6.5% versus
54.6 ± 6.5%; p = 0.0376).ARB users had a lower frequency
of dialysis-requiring CHF, as compared to ARB non-users
(18.5% versus 22.7%; p = 0.0460), despite their higher fre-
quency of diabetic kidney disease, which was usually asso-
ciated with a higher prevalence of CHF.10,11,13,15,16 Among
the risk factors for CHF that were confirmed in our multi-
variate logistic analysis, no significant difference was seen
in the frequency of IHD history and serum CRP concentra-
tion, between ARB-users and non-users.
Forrest plots of the factors associated with CHF
Figure 3 shows the log-scale Forrest plots for the signifi-
cant explanatory variables in the multivariate-adjusted
logistic regression analysis of risk factors for CHF. Among
all CKD medications examined in this study, only ARB use
was negatively and independently associated with dialysis-
requiring CHF development in the Stage 5 CKD Japanese
patients, although ACEI use was not significantly associ-
ated. Furthermore, the use of loop diuretics, diabetic kidney
disease, a history of IHD, lower levels of serum albumin
and hemoglobin, and higher levels of CRP and eGFR, were
also independently associated with CHF development.
Discussion
The present multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional
study showed only ARB use was significantly associated
with the lower prevalence of dialysis-requiring CHF in
non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD among
CKD medications examined in present study. The ARB
users had a lower frequency of dialysis-requiring CHF,

with a higher prevalence of CHF.10,11,13,15,16,33 Logistic
regression analysis revealed that diabetic kidney disease
was also an independent risk factor for CHF, despite its
higher comorbidity in the ARB user group. Therefore, we
estimated that ARB use may prevent dialysis-requiring
CHF in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.
In the present study, ACEI use was not significantly
associated with dialysis-requiring CHF. The maximum
doses of ACEIs are permitted at a relatively lower range in
Japan (enalapril, imidapril, lisinopril, trandolapril, cila-
zapril and captopril are used at one-quarter to one-half
doses) than in Europe and USA, so ACEIs might not fully
reduce CHF in Japan. For example, imidapril is used at
lower doses, ranging from 2.5­10 mg in Japan, compared
to relatively higher doses ranging from 5­20 mg in Europe;
and ramipril, an effective ACEI for reduction of
cardiovascular events, has not been used in Japan because
of it giving persistent cough. Thus, different types and
relatively lower doses of ACEIs used in Japan may affect
the present consequence (no association between ACEI
use and CHF development). Therefore, additional studies
are needed to clarify the effect of these drugs on CHF
development, in patients with Stage 5 CKD in Japan.
A recent meta-analysis revealed significant reduction of
CHF by ACEIs in early-to-moderate CKD patients with
diabetes mellitus,12 but originally published articles34­41
included in this meta-analysis did not show a significant
reduction by ACEIs, except for the HOPE study.41 This
HOPE study evaluated ramipril efficacy on CVD, but ram-
ipril has not been approved in Japan. Thus, the results of
the present study (ACEIs have non-significant reduction
of CHF) are not inconsistent with previous studies. Though

ARBs have been shown to have a significant reduction of
CHF in early-to-moderate CKD patients with diabetes
mellitus,42­44 the preventive effect of dialysis-requiring
CHF in Stage 5 CKD patients by ARBs has not been
reported to date. The present study revealed the possible
prevention of dialysis-requiring CHF by ARBs, in CKD
Stage 5 Japanese patients.
Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms responsible
for ARB-related prevention of CHF are poorly under-
stood. In the context of tissue protection, blockade of the
renin-angiotensin system using ACEIs or ARBs can pre-
vent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclero-
sis, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.45
One possible explanation is that angiotensin-II may
increase the permeability of the lung vessels,46 while
another report suggests that angiotensin-II directly
induces heart failure in a mouse model of heart failure.47
Thus, it is possible that ARB use may reduce the risk of
CHF via these mechanisms.
Recently, a large clinical trial involving 20,854 patients
revealed the proportion of the patients with CHF at the ini-
tiation of dialysis was 19.8%, in Japan.48 This prevalence
rate was similar to our present data (20.1%); which is a rela-
tively lower frequency, compared to both Canada (31%)49
and USA (30.7% in the CKD without diabetes group and
52.3% in the CKD with diabetes group).50
There was a significant trend for a stepwise increase in
the prevalence of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to
< 55%, corresponding to the advancement in the patients
with diabetes kidney disease from CKD Stage 3 to Stage
5.51 The percentage of LVEF in CKD patients is reported as
69.9 ± 10.4% in Stage 3; 68.2 ± 10.3% in Stage 4; and 67.1
± 11.0% in Stage 5 pre-dialysis patients (P < 0.05, when
compared with Stage 3),52 suggesting a stepwise increase in
the risk for CHF that corresponds to the stage of advance-
ment of CKD.
Our present study also confirmed that loop diuretic users
tended to start dialysis, due to CHF development. In addi-
tion, planned dialysis without obvious uremic symptoms
was successfully performed more frequently in patients
whom did not use loop diuretics (loop diuretics users:
42.39% versus non-users: 57.63%; p < 0.0001). Indeed, the
patients with an edematous condition will frequently need
loop diuretics to treat the edema and prevent CHF develop-
ment. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in
the use of loop diuretics between ARB users and non-users,
suggesting that ARB non-users did not contain the patients
with an edematous condition whom easily developed CHF.
In dialysis patients, CHF development is reported to be
associated with diabetes mellitus,33 a history of IHD,49
anemia,49 hypoalbuminemia,49 and higher levels of
eGFR53,54 and CRP.55­57 Our results also supported that
these factors are associated with CHF development in non-
dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD; however, we
did not observe any significant differences regarding the
history of IHD, or hemoglobin, eGFR, albumin or CRP
levels, when comparing theARB user and non-user groups.
This absence of significant differences supports the con-
clusion that these factors are independent risk factors for
CHF development.
There are several limitations in this study:
1. The present study used a cross-sectional design,
and we do not have any information regarding the
types, dosage and duration of each medication;
2. We had no data from the echocardiography, such as
left ventricular ejection fraction;
3. The low frequency of use for several medications
(e.g. ACEI, VDRA, CaCO3
and AST-120) may
have decreased the sensitivity of our statistical
analysis; and
4. Finally, we did not analyze the patients' lipid pro-
files or use of statins and other lipid-lowering
drugs, as this information was not consistently
available.
Conclusion
We found that ARB use during the pre-dialysis period is
associated with a lower prevalence of CHF in non-dialysis
Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD, suggesting ARB may
provide a possible prevention of dialysis-requiring CHF in
non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD; how-
ever, well-controlled prospective studies are needed to
confirm our results, given the present study's cross-sec-
tional design.
