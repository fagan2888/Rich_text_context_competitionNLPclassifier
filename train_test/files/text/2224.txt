Sexual Risk-Taking Among Adult Dating Couples
In the United States
Despite the many emotional and social benefits of sexual
behavior in relationships, there is also the threat of contract-
ing STDs, including HIV. Rates of heterosexual transmission
of these diseases remain unacceptably high. The need for
STD prevention is especially great for nonresidential partners
(unmarried and noncohabiting dating couples), who are less
likely than married or cohabiting couples to be monoga-
mous and who may engage in riskier sexual behaviors.1
Much of what we know about sexual and contraceptive
behaviors as risk factors for STDs, as well as pregnancy,
is based on women's or men's separate reports of their
attitudes and behaviors. Relatively little research has been
based on reports obtained from both partners in a couple,
even though sexual behavior is inherently dyadic. At most,
studies obtain proxy reports from one partner about the
other partner's characteristics, behavior and attitudes. Here,
we address this limitation by using data from the National
Couples Survey to examine how the self-reported charac-
teristics, attitudes and behaviors of each partner are related
to dating couples' sexual risk-taking. Specifically, we exam-
ine whether the couple had anal sex during the four weeks
prior to the interview and whether they did anything dur-
ing that time to protect themselves from STDs.
Our analyses advance prior research in two other impor-
tant ways. First, we include measures of the respondent's
and partner's prior sexual risk-taking behaviors and
perceptions of AIDS risk and severity, to examine the ex-
tent to which these framing events and perceptions are
associated with recent sexual risk-taking. Second, we
examine how relationship power, defined along several
dimensions, and perceived level of control over sex and
contraception moderate, or condition, the associations be-
tween respondent and partner characteristics and sexual
and contraceptive behaviors.
NEEDED FOCUS ON COUPLES
One reason for the prior research focus on individuals'
sexual and contraceptive behavior is the lack of couples
data. The few studies that have had couples data have
tended to be based on small, purposive samples of mainly
white, middle-class, married, college-age or young at-risk
minority couples.2­6 Most studies have focused not on
sexual behavior and sexual decision making, but on fer-
tility behavior and intentions, and contraceptive use.7­15
More research now stresses the importance to STD risk
of couples' relationship characteristics, such as length and
type of relationship,16,17 gender and power dynamics with-
in relationships18­22 and partner support of condom use.23
Most of these studies, however, have limited findings be-
cause of the specific populations available for analysis. An
CONTEXT: Knowledge of sexual and contraceptive behaviors as risk factors for STDs is largely based on women's or
men's separate reports of their attitudes and behaviors. Little research has been based on couples.
METHODS: Data from the 2005­2006 National Couples Survey were used to examine the sexual risk-taking behavior
of 335 dating couples. Associations between each partner's characteristics and the couple's probability of recently
having had anal sex and of having done something to protect themselves from STDs were assessed using logistic
regression analyses. Models included measures of power dynamics and partners' perceptions of who controls sexual
and contraceptive decisions.
RESULTS: Couples in which the female partner reported that her male partner made the decisions about sex
and contraception had increased probability of having had anal sex during the four weeks prior to the interview.
In addition, partners' relationship power and their perception of control over sex and contraception moderated
associations between couples' behavior and partners' characteristics, experiences and beliefs. For example, although
couples in which the male partners had known someone with AIDS were less likely than others to engage in anal sex,
that association was much greater for males with high income--and thus greater power--than for those with low
income.
CONCLUSIONS: Sexual behaviors are not controlled by any one individual in a relationship; characteristics of each
partner are important. Couples-based interventions that take into consideration relationship--especially power--
dynamics may enable individuals to initiate and sustain safer-sex practices.

exception to these generalizations is the "couples sample"
of Wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health (Add Health).24
There are good reasons to adopt a couples perspective
to gain a better understanding of sexual behavior in gen-
eral, and of sexual risk-taking in particular. First, most
sexual behavior occurs within a close relationship and
cannot be separated from that relationship.25,26 Research
that uses information from both partners can examine
individual and relationship variables that combine to de-
termine interdependent decision making.27,28 Second, re-
lying on reports from only one partner forces one to draw
conclusions about a couple's behavior on the basis of that
person's perspective, which can lead to a distortion of the
individual and joint characteristics of the partners that af-
fect the couple's behavior.4,29
Third, adopting a couples perspective allows exami-
nation of the effects on sexual risk-taking of a range of
potentially important factors, including power within the
relationship. In general terms, power refers to the relative
ability of one partner to act independently, to dominate
decision making, to engage in behavior against the other
partner's wishes or to control a partner's actions.21 Power
plays a role in determining what, when and how sexual
and contraceptive behaviors take place.30 Despite the norm
of egalitarianism in romantic relationships in the United
States, power imbalances occur.31 One source of power
differences between partners is gender role ideology. Indi-
viduals who have an egalitarian gender role orientation are
more likely than others to adopt traits and behaviors that
are nontraditional for their gender.32,33 As such, they will
have more balanced dependencies in their relationships,
and each partner's sexual preferences will have a similar
level of influence in the decision making. In contrast, in a
traditional gender role orientation, the man's power may
be greater and decisions about sex may therefore be more
strongly influenced by his preferences.34,35 To our knowl-
edge, no study has examined the gender role ideologies of
both partners and how these beliefs influence a couple's
sexual risk-taking behavior.
Nor has gender role ideology been considered jointly
with other dimensions of power within the relationship.
Structural power may arise from individual characteristics
that are linked to inequality in the larger social structure,
such as education or income.2,21 Power also emerges from
differences between partners in their level of commit-
ment to the relationship. The more highly committed a
partner is, the more dependent, and thus less powerful
in sexual decision making, he or she will be.36 Similarly,
when individuals believe they have little trouble in attract-
ing potential partners, they will perceive more alternatives
to their current partnership, be less dependent on it and
thus have greater power.27 A final source of power are the
compliance-gaining strategies (e.g., manipulating, bully-
ing, distancing and bargaining) used by each partner when
negotiating decisions and wanting the other partner to do
something he or she does not want to do.37
In this article, we examine how power weights the
decision-making process toward one partner or the other,
by elevating or reducing the importance of a person's be-
liefs or characteristics. Power differences between partners
in gender role ideology and other dimensions of power
can also lead to differences in beliefs about level of control
over sex and contraception. Hence, we also examine how
these beliefs moderate the impact of each partner's charac-
teristics on the couple's sexual risk-taking behaviors.
METHODS
Data and Study Population
Our data are from the dating couples sample of the
National Couples Survey, conducted in 2005­2006. Both
partners of 335 dating heterosexual couples completed
interviews; dating was defined as currently being in an
unmarried, noncohabiting sexual relationship of at least
one month's duration. Because the primary purpose of the
survey was to provide information on couples' decisions
about contraception, females were eligible if aged 20­35
(the ages during which most childbearing occurs), not
sterile and not pregnant or trying to get pregnant; male
partners had to be not sterile and 18 or older, so that both
partners were adults and parental informed consent was
not necessary.
Computer-assisted self-interviewing was used to collect
data from an area probability sample of household resi-
dents in four cities (Baltimore; Durham, NC; St. Louis; and
Seattle) and the U.S. census­defined county subdivisions
immediately adjacent to them. These sites provide diverse
populations with respect to race, ethnicity, economic sta-
tus and other factors associated with sexual and contra-
ceptive decision making. Within the four study sites, we
stratified segments by the percentage of population who
were black and oversampled segments with high minor-
ity concentrations. This procedure yielded a large enough
sample of couples in which one or both partners were
black to provide stable estimates of both their behaviors
and the antecedents of those behaviors. Participants were
recruited through door-to-door visits from female inter-
viewers; where possible, the race of the interviewer was
matched with that of the respondent.
During the survey effort, 65% of households were suc-
cessfully rostered (i.e., all adult residents were listed by age).
Twenty-seven percent of rostered households had at least
one age-eligible person;* if a household contained more
than one age-eligible person, one was randomly selected
for eligibility screening on the other survey criteria. Eligi-
bility screening was completed for 79% of selected poten-
tial respondents. Those who were eligible for the study and
were defined as dating were asked to recruit their partners;
77% of partners were screened, and 94% of eligible dating
*Only 18­45-year-old males were included in the roster, because men
of this age were the most likely to have age-eligible female partners.
If a female was selected for screening, there was no upper limit on her
partner's age as a selection criterion.
Sexual Risk-Taking Among Adult Dating Couples
76 Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health
couples completed the survey. Partners were scheduled to
take the survey contemporaneously and were restricted
from communicating about their answers. The question-
naires for males and females were nearly identical.
Analysis weights were constructed for each study site;
the sampling weights reflected the probability of selec-
tion of each sampled address and of the couple sampled
from that address, and were adjusted to account for non-
response. The weights were then readjusted such that each
site impacted the analysis equally.
Measures
Outcomes. We examined two couple behaviors that
increase a person's risk of STD infection. The first was
whether the couple had had anal intercourse during the
four weeks prior to the interview. Even though anal inter-
course is generally recognized as being riskier than vaginal
sex in terms of HIV transmission,38,39 it has received little
research attention in heterosexual populations. The sec-
ond outcome concerned whether a respondent and his or
her partner had decided to do anything in the last four
weeks to protect themselves against STDs. We defined
a trichotomous measure with categories "did nothing,"
"used condom" and "engaged in less risky sex practices"
(i.e., decided not to have sex with other partners, to have
fewer partners, to have sex with each other less often or
not to have certain kinds of sex that are "more risky").
Individual and couple characteristics. We considered the
following socioeconomic and demographic characteristics
of both partners: age (in years), race and ethnicity (Hispanic,
non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic other), completed
education (in years), personal income (logged) during the
last calendar year and religiosity (a dichotomy defined
as not religious at all versus somewhat or very religious).
Also included were mother's education and father's educa-
tion (less than high school graduate, high school graduate,
some college, college graduate and "no man [woman] who
mostly raised you"). Finally, we included relationship dura-
tion, measured as the number of months that the partners
had been "seeing each other on a regular basis."
Measures for three personal framing events--behaviors
or experiences that may affect an individual's subsequent
STD risk-taking behavior--were examined. Lifetime num-
ber of sex partners was a continuous measure, truncated
at the point where the distribution became highly skewed.
STD infection prior to first sex with the current partner
and ever having known someone with AIDS were dichoto-
mous measures.
We measured perceptions of AIDS risk with variables
representing beliefs about the percentage chance a man
will get AIDS and the percentage chance a woman will
get AIDS "if they have intercourse only once without us-
ing any contraception with a partner who has AIDS or the
virus that causes AIDS." Perception of AIDS severity was a
summative scale based on respondents' level of agreement
(1="very strongly disagree" to 5="very strongly agree")
with eight statements about how bad it would be to get
AIDS (e.g., "People who get AIDS always develop many
painful symptoms"). The higher the score, the greater the
perceived severity.
Relationship power and control. We included several
measures of the underlying sources of relationship power.
First were measures of structural power based on personal
education and income (defined above). Another power di-
mension was relationship commitment, based on respons-
es to the question "Compared to your partner, who is more
committed to making your relationship last?" (1="definitely
me" to 5="definitely him/her").36 Another power dimension
was relationship alternatives, based on responses to three
questions--e.g., "If you broke up this month, how likely
is it that you could find another partner better than him/
her?" (1="impossible" to 4="certain").40 These questions
were factor-analyzed, and we constructed a scale on which
a more positive score indicates more perceived alterna-
tives. Traditional gender role ideology was measured using
items from the Sex Role Egalitarianism Scale.41 The eight
items in this summative scale asked how strongly respon-
dents agreed with statements about the roles of husbands
and wives: for example, "A wife's career is less important
than her husband's" (1="very strongly disagree" to 5="very
strongly agree"). The higher the score, the greater the tradi-
tionalism. Finally, two variables captured the strategies the
respondent and his or her partner used to gain compliance
from each other.37 Respondents were first asked how often
their partner used six specific tactics (e.g., manipulation,
bullying and distancing) to get what they want (1="never"
to 9="always"). They were then asked about the tactics they
used with their partner, using parallel questions and the
same response set. Responses were factor-analyzed, and we
formed two scales, one reflecting the respondent's strategy
and one reflecting the partner's strategy. The higher the
value, the more often coercive tactics are used.
Control over sex was measured using a summative scale
based on a set of questions asking for level of agreement
(1="very strongly disagree" to 5="very strongly agree")
with 10 statements about the individual's perceived level
of control over the sexual activity of the couple (e.g., "I
often take the initiative in beginning sexual activity"). The
higher the score, the greater the control over sex. Similarly,
control over contraception was measured using a summa-
tive scale based on level of agreement (1="very strongly
disagree" to 5="very strongly agree") with three statements
(e.g., "My partner makes most of the decisions about what
birth control the two of us will use").42 A final composite
measure of control over sex and contraception was based
on four questions on who usually makes the final deci-
sion about "when to have sex," "what the two of you do
when you have sex," "whether you use birth control at
any particular time when you have sex" and "what kind
of birth control to use."43 Responses (1="I always decide"
to 5="he/she always decides") were factor-analyzed, and
a scale of decisions about sex and contraception was cre-
ated. The higher the value, the greater the likelihood that
the respondent's partner makes the decisions.

Analytic Approach
To maintain the couple as the unit of analysis and to be
able to assess the impact of each partner's characteristics
on the couple's sexual risk-taking behavior, we selected the
female partner as the index respondent. We then examined
how her characteristics and reports and those of her male
partner were related to her report of each outcome.
Multivariate models of the dichotomous measure of anal
sex were estimated using the logit procedure in STATA.
Models of the trichotomous STD protective behaviors out-
come were estimated using the multinomial logit proce-
dure. Although the level of nonresponse was low (less than
5% for almost all items), selection bias because of missing
data may have affected our results. To deal with this is-
sue, we employed multiple imputation procedures44,45 to
estimate our models over the full sample of 335 dating
couples.
For each outcome, we first estimated a main effects
model that included relationship duration as reported by
the female, both partners' social and demographic char-
acteristics, their reports of framing events, and their per-
ceived risk and severity of AIDS. Next, we interacted each
variable in the main effects models with each power mea-
sure, to determine how relationship power conditioned
associations between the independent variables and out-
comes. We then derived a final model that included the
significant power interaction terms, which most succinctly
describe how the multiple dimensions of power condition
the associations of the other variables with the outcome,
as well as all the significant main effect terms. To maintain
a minimum level of social and demographic background
control, relationship duration and the female respondent's
age and race and ethnicity were retained regardless of sig-
nificance level.
In additional analyses, we repeated the same procedures,
except testing for interactions between each partner's char-
acteristics and his or her beliefs about his or her control
over sex and contraception. Doing so allowed a compari-
son with the model containing power interactions, to see
how similarly measures of relationship power and beliefs
about controlling sex and contraception are associated
with each risk-taking behavior.
Although the coefficients in these models adequately
convey the direction of the effects and whether they are
statistically significant, they are difficult to interpret sub-
stantively. Thus, we calculated predicted probabilities of
the extent to which a couple with a certain characteristic
engaged in each risk-taking behavior.* For continuous
measures, we calculated predicted probabilities for "low"

perceived relationship commitment relative to their partners, greater perceived relationship alternatives,
more traditional gender role beliefs, more frequent use of coercive tactics and greater perceived likelihood
that their partners make the decisions about sex and contraception.
*In performing these simulations, we gave each respondent her and
her partner's own value on all of the characteristics included in the logit
model, except on the characteristic of interest. For example, to get the
predicted probability that a couple whose female partner is black, His-

four weeks, we gave all couples their actual values on all characteristics
and beliefs, except race and ethnicity. We then calculated a predicted

RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Twenty-two percent of women and 27% of their male
partners reported that they (the couple) had had anal sex
in the prior four weeks (Table 1, page 77). Sixty-two per-
cent of women reported that the couple had done noth-
ing in the prior four weeks to protect themselves from
STDs; 30% had used condoms, and 8% had decided
to engage in less risky sex practices. The proportions
reported by male partners were 61%, 32% and 7%, re-
spectively, indicating, as with anal sex, some discrepancy
in reporting. As noted above, the outcome measures in
the multivariate analyses reported here are based on the
female partner's reports.
The average relationship duration was 34 months as re-
ported by the female partner and 35 months as reported
by the male partner. The mean age of females was 27 and
of males was 29. Nearly half of the couples were black, as
defined by either partner; the rest were mostly nonblack
and non-Hispanic. On average, both women and men had
had 13 years of schooling; distributions with respect to
parental education were similar. Males had a higher mean
personal income than females, and a greater proportion of
males than of females reported not being religious (48%
vs. 32%).
The mean lifetime number of sexual partners was 14
for women and 22 for men. Roughly one-fifth of males
and females had had a STD; 44% of females and 51%
of males had known someone with AIDS. On average,
females perceived that men's and women's chances of get-
ting AIDS from an infected partner were 73% and 77%,
respectively; males perceived men's and women's risk
at 63% and 72%. Females' perception of AIDS severity
was only slightly higher than males'. Females and males
had similar average commitment to making their rela-
tionship last and perception of relationship alternatives.
Males tended to report having a more traditional gen-
der role ideology than females. On average, females were
less likely than males to report that their partner uses
more coercive tactics to get what he wants; they were
also less likely than males to report that they use those
tactics themselves. On average, females reported having
more control over sex and less control over contracep-
tion than males; females were less likely than males to
say that their partner makes the decisions about sex and
contraception.
Anal Sex
The probability that a couple had had anal sex in the prior
four weeks was not associated with relationship duration,
the female partner's age or her race and ethnicity (Table 2).
The probability of anal sex was significantly lower, how-
ever, if the female partner perceived women's chance of
acquiring AIDS from an infected partner to be 75% rather
than 25% (0.22 vs. 0.29). In addition, a couple's probabil-
ity of anal sex decreased with increased education of the
male partner's father (from 0.37 for men whose fathers had
not graduated from high school to 0.07 for men whose
fathers had graduated from college), suggesting that anal
sex is practiced by couples of lower socioeconomic origin.
Furthermore, the probability of anal sex was higher if the

*For example,we evaluated the effect of relationship duration when the
couple had been together for one month compared with 48 months.
In our multivariate models, we used females'reports to define relation-
ship duration. Despite some discrepancies between males' and females'
reports of relationship duration, using males'instead of females'did not
alter our findings.All other measures are constructed for each partner on
the basis of self-reports.

male partner held a more traditional rather than less tradi-
tional gender role ideology (0.34 vs. 0.07).
The associations between two other characteristics and
anal sex were conditioned by the male's power in the re-
lationship. Males with more power than other males, as
assessed by education level, had a lower probability of anal
sex if they perceived women's chance of acquiring AIDS
from an infected partner to be 75% rather than 25%. Fur-
thermore, although male partners who had known some-
one with AIDS were less likely than those who had not to
report anal sex, the difference in probabilities was much
larger among males with high income (0.15 vs. 0.26) than
among those with low income (0.20 vs. 0.23).
In analyses including partners' beliefs about level of
control over sex and contraception, the probability that
a couple had had anal sex in the prior four weeks was
again not associated with relationship duration, female
partner's age or her race and ethnicity (Table 3). It re-
mained associated with the education level of the male's
father and was marginally associated with the female's
perceived risk of AIDS. In addition, male's education was
inversely related to the probability of reporting anal sex
(0.23 for 12 years and 0.16 for 16 years). Furthermore,
a couple's probability of having had anal sex was higher
with the female's increased lifetime number of sex part-
ners (0.18 for one partner and 0.20 for 10 partners),
suggesting that prior risk-taking is related to subsequent
risk-taking.
The probability of anal sex was greater if the female be-
lieved that her partner made the decisions about sex and
contraception than if she believed that she made them
(0.26 vs.0.14). However, the data suggest that the female's
perceived control over sex conditions the relationship be-
tween perceived severity of AIDS and anal sex. Among
women who reported low control over sex, the probability
of anal sex was similar regardless of their perception of
AIDS severity (0.22­0.24); but among women who re-
ported high control over sex, the probability of anal sex
was inversely related to their perceptions of the severe
consequences of acquiring AIDS (0.29­0.16). The male's
perception of control over sex also seems to be important.
A couple's probability of anal sex was similar if the male
partner reported low control over sex--regardless of his
high or low perceived risk of AIDS--and if he reported
high control over sex but a high perceived risk of AIDS
(0.23­0.27). However, if a male partner reported high
control and a low perceived risk of AIDS, the couple had a
much greater probability of anal sex (0.45).
STD Protective Behaviors
The probability that a couple had decided to take measures
to protect themselves from STDs in the prior four weeks
was not significantly associated with relationship duration
or female partner's age (Table 4, page 80). Compared with
women who had had one sexual partner, those who had
had 10 had a greater probability of reporting that they
and their partners had decided to engage in less risky sex

practices (0.07 vs. 0.06) and a lower probability of saying
that they had done nothing to protect themselves (0.63
vs. 0.64). Increased male partner's education and income
were associated with greater probabilities of having done
nothing to prevent STDs and lower probabilities of having
decided to engage in less risky sex practices.
Sexual Risk-Taking Among Adult Dating Couples
80 Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health
Several associations were conditioned by relationship
power. A woman's perception of AIDS severity had no
association with the couple's protective behavior if she
had low education. However, among better educated
(i.e., more powerful) women, those who perceived high
severity of AIDS had a lower probability than those who
perceived low severity of having done nothing (0.55 vs.
0.70); they had higher probabilities of having used con-
doms (0.27 vs. 0.23) and having decided to engage in less
risky sex practices (0.17 vs. 0.07).
Gender role ideology moderates the relationship between
a woman's race and ethnicity and her and her partner's STD
protective behaviors. Among women who held more tradi-
tional beliefs (i.e., had less power), the couple's probability
of having done nothing to protect themselves from STDs dif-
fered little by race and ethnicity. There were differences by
race and ethnicity, however, among couples who did protect
themselves: Nonblack, non-Hispanic women had a greater
probability of having used condoms than did black and His-
panic women (0.42 vs. 0.26­0.28), whereas black women
had a greater probability than Hispanics and other wom-
en of having decided to engage in less risky sex practices
(0.19 vs. 0.03­0.07). Among couples in which the woman
held less traditional, more egalitarian beliefs (i.e., had more
power), black women had a much greater probability than
Hispanic and other women of reporting condom use (0.34
vs. 0.05­0.09), a slightly greater probability of reporting a
decision to engage in less risky sex practices (0.14 vs. 0.06­
0.10), and a much lower probability of having decided not
to take preventive measures (0.52 vs. 0.86 each).
Male power was also important. Among couples in
which the male reported having a more committed part-
ner (i.e., he has more power), the probability of having
decided to engage in less risky sex practices was much
greater if the male had had a prior STD than if he had not
(0.36 vs. 0.03); the probability of having done nothing
was lower in this situation (0.40 vs. 0.62). Having had an
STD made little difference in the couple's behavior when
the male partner reported being more committed to the
relationship. Furthermore, for men who reported that
their female partner seldom used coercive strategies to get
what she wanted (i.e., he had more power), having known
someone with AIDS was marginally associated with the
probability of having decided to engage in less risky sex
practices; there were no other significant differences for
the interaction of compliance-gaining strategies and males'
knowledge of someone with AIDS.
In analyses including partners' beliefs about level of
control over sex and contraception, longer relationship
duration, which was not significant in previous analyses,
was associated with a couple's higher probability of having
done nothing to protect themselves against STDs (0.56­
0.65) and their lower probability of having used condoms
(0.27­0.34; Table 5). The other significant findings from
this model highlight and support some of the main results
reported in Table 4. Females' lifetime number of partners
and males' education exhibited the same associations with
the outcome as in Table 4. When females reported that
their partners made the decisions about sex and contra-
ception, probability of condom use did not differ by race
and ethnicity; but when females reported making those
decisions, black females had a much greater probability of
condom use than Hispanics and other females. These find-
ings are similar to those regarding the interaction between
gender role ideology and race and ethnicity.
In addition, among women who perceived low con-
trol over sex, perception of AIDS severity was unrelated

to the couple's protective behavior; however, among
women who reported high control, perceiving more
severe consequences of AIDS was associated with a lower
probability of not protecting themselves from STDs and
a greater probability of deciding to engage in less risky
sex practices. Finally, among men who reported that their
partners made the decisions about sex and contraception,
male's prior STD status had little effect; but when males
reported making such decisions, prior STD infection was
marginally associated with a lower probability of taking
no preventive measures and with a greater probability of
deciding to engage in less risky practices.
Using Male Reports of the Outcomes--Does It Matter?
As in any couples survey, partners' reporting of the out-
comes examined disagreed somewhat. To determine
whether we would have come to the same conclusions if
we had used the males' reports of the outcomes instead
of the females',* we estimated models corresponding to
those presented in Tables 2­5 that included both men and
women in individual-level models, used their respective
reports of each outcome and adjusted the standard errors
for clustering at the couple level. We then added a main
effects term indicating the respondent's gender, along with
interaction terms of gender with every other variable.
We then assessed whether the introduction of these vari-
ables significantly improved the fit of the model without
the gender main effect and interaction terms. This pro-
cedure is equivalent to estimating separate models using
the female's and male's reports of each outcome and then
comparing the results, but has the advantage of provid-
ing information about whether any differences by gender
in the relationships of personal and partner characteristics
with the outcome are statistically significant.
We found no improvement in the overall fit of the mod-
els after taking respondent gender into account. Further-
more, the gender main effect term was never significant,
and only a few of the gender interaction terms were sig-
nificant in any model. Thus, overall, our results were rela-
tively unaffected by using female reports of the outcomes.
DISCUSSION
Our results show that a couple's sexual behaviors are not
controlled totally by either partner. Therefore, relying
solely on women's or men's reports would miss important
partner influences, and proxy reports might be inaccurate
enough to distort the partner's influence.
Several of each partner's characteristics are significantly
related to the couple's sexual risk-taking. Importantly,
partners' power and perception of control over sex and
contraception are significant moderators of some of
females' and males' characteristics, experiences and beliefs.
Indeed, without taking relationship power into account,
we would miss the importance of knowledge of someone
with AIDS, prior STD and perception of AIDS severity, for
example, which are related to sexual risk-taking only if
a certain partner has enough relationship power to influ-
ence the sexual situation.
We find that couples of lower socioeconomic status, as
measured by the male partner's own and his father's edu-
cation, have an elevated probability of having engaged in
anal sex in the last four weeks. Some previous research
suggests that increased socioeconomic status is associated
with increased willingness to engage in a variety of non-
traditional sexual activities, including nonvaginal sex.46,47
Typically, such findings have pertained to ever having ex-
perienced anal sex. Individuals of higher socioeconomic
status may be more likely than others to experiment with
*Differences in reports of the outcome by females and males are the only
thing that can change the results,because all of our models contain pre-
dictor variables based on each partner's reports.
Full results of these analyses are available from the authors.

Sexual Risk-Taking Among Adult Dating Couples
82 Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health
anal sex, but less likely to engage in the behavior on a reg-
ular basis--an idea also supported by previous research.46
Framing events and perceived risk are also significantly
related to a couple's anal sex behavior: Couples in which the
female partner has had a greater number of sexual partners
have a relatively higher probability of reporting anal sex,
and couples in which the female perceived high risk of get-
ting AIDS have a relatively lower probability of the behav-
ior. Power of one partner or the other and perceived control
over sex and contraception are also important. Anal sex is
negatively related to the female's perception of AIDS severity
only when the female has more control over sex. Further, a
male's greater perception of AIDS risk and his having known
someone with AIDS are most strongly related to anal sex
when he has more power or has more control over sex.
The gender role ideology of the male partner is very
strongly related to whether the couple has anal sex; cou-
ples in which the male has a more traditional gender role
ideology have a higher probability of engaging in this be-
havior. Males overall may have a stronger preference for
anal sex than females, as evidenced by females' reports
that they are more likely to have anal sex when their part-
ner decides about sex and contraception.
Increased lifetime number of sex partners reported by
females is associated with increased probability that the
couple has decided to engage in less risky sex practices.
This suggests that a woman who has had many partners
better understands that she and her current partner may
be at increased risk of STD infection because of her history.
Higher male education and income are associated with a
couple's increased probability of doing nothing to protect
against STDs and reduced probability of deciding to engage
in less risky sex practices, suggesting a lower perceived risk
of infection among those of higher socioeconomic status.
Women of different races and ethnicities may use their
relationship power differently. Hispanics and other women
who have more egalitarian gender role ideology may give
their partners more say in regard to condom use, and their
partners may opt not to use condoms because condoms in-
terfere with sexual pleasure.48 Black women who have less
traditional gender role ideology, however, may be more in-
sistent about condom use; greater use among blacks is con-
sistent with the literature.49 A standard interpretation is that
blacks perceive themselves as having a higher risk of STDs
than whites because they have a higher disease prevalence.
Our findings may help inform new couples-based pre-
vention interventions, to more effectively fight STD trans-
mission. Most STD prevention messages direct little atten-
tion toward the relationship status of sex partners and the
need to promote safer sex within affectionate rather than
just casual relationships.22,50,51
Importantly, although using condoms and being monog-
amous certainly reduce the incidence of new infections,
public health efforts have largely underestimated the dif-
ficulty people have in following these recommendations.
Individuals, especially women, may find it difficult to
introduce or sustain safer-sex practices because of partners'
negative reactions, such as terminating the relationship or
engaging in intimate partner violence.52 In addition, inter-
ventions that expect participants to share new knowledge
with their sexual partner assume that they have the neces-
sary communication skills.51 Individuals may be unable to
practice safer-sex behavior with their partner because of
factors such as gender role expectations or power imbal-
ances in the relationship.
Couples-based interventions that take into consideration
relationship, especially power, dynamics may enable indi-
viduals to initiate and sustain safer-sex practices. Several
STD prevention interventions for heterosexual couples
have been efficacious in reducing risky sexual behavior
and increasing safer sex practices.52­54 Furthermore, they
show that it is feasible to recruit for and conduct couples-
based STD prevention interventions. Couples-based inter-
ventions further grounded in research that accounts for
the many relationship influences forming the context for
human sexual behavior and attitudes may help redress the
continuing problem of STD infection in the United States.
