The use of calendars to measure child illness
in health interview surveys
Noreen Goldman,a Barbara Vaughana and Anne R Pebleyb
Background During the past two decades, health interview surveys have become an increas-
ingly common source of information about current morbidity patterns and
utilization of health services in developing countries. This study describes a recent
effort to enhance the utility of these surveys by incorporating a calendar format.
Methods A calendar of morbidity and treatment behaviour during the 2-week period prior
to interview was implemented in the Guatemalan Survey of Family Health
(EGSF), a large-scale sample survey that was fielded in 60 communities in rural
Guatemala in 1995. A total of 2872 women aged 18-35 were interviewed and
provided information on 3193 children born since 1990.
Results The EGSF calendar data provide estimates of diarrhoeal illness that are consistent
with those obtained from more conventional questionnaire designs. However, in
contrast to conventional health survey questions, these calendar data: (1) permit
a much more complete evaluation of the accuracy of reporting; and (2) offer a
richer and more complex description of child illness and treatment behaviour.
For example, the results demonstrate that even the preferred 2-week recall period
suffers from underreporting of diarrhoeal illness, that the majority of children
with diarrhoea experience at least one additional symptom, and that mothers assess
severity of diarrhoea from the type and number of accompanying symptoms.
Conclusions The findings indicate that additional implementation and evaluation of calendar
formats is warranted in order to provide the most useful and accurate data
possible at relatively low cost.

During the past two decades, health interview surveys have
become an increasingly common source of information about
current morbidity patterns and utilization of health services in
developing countries. These surveys typically involve a single
cross-sectional interview in which respondents are asked to
report the illnesses that they have experienced and the health
services or treatments that they have used within a specified
period prior to interview. In surveys of child illness, mothers are
typically proxy respondents for their children.
Single cross-sectional interviews have several advantages
over clinical studies and longitudinal surveys, most notably
their low cost and the ease of obtaining a representative sample
of a large population. On the other hand, they are more likely
to result in inaccurate reports of illness and treatment behav-
iour, particularly in comparison with studies that rely on med-
ical professionals or clinical records for the assessment of illness

and treatment. In view of these limitations, there have been
several attempts in recent years to improve and standardize the
design of health interview surveys. These efforts have resulted
in some enhancements, such as use of a 2-week recall period for
questions related to morbidity--a period which is considered by
many investigators to offer the best balance between recall error
and maintaining a feasible sample size--and greater reliance on
a list of tracer conditions and symptoms to identify particular
illnesses.13'4
The present study describes a recent effort to further improve
the usefulness of the health interview survey, by providing a
much richer description of illness. The essence of the new sur-
vey design is its reliance on a calendar of morbidity and treat-
ment behaviour in the 2-week period prior to interview. While
a calendar approach has been shown to have several advantages
over more conventional designs in other contexts (such as for
the collection of contraceptive histories),5 it has rarely been
used in health interview surveys. The authors recently imple-
mented a calendar approach in a large-scale sample survey,
the Guatemalan Survey of Family Health (EGSF),6 which was
fielded during May-September, 1995 in 60 rural communities
505

of Guatemala. The survey data were designed to measure child
and pregnancy-related illness and treatment behaviour, along
with important family- and community-level factors such as social
support, poverty, health beliefs, and the availability of health
providers. A total of 2872 women aged 18-35 were interviewed
and provided information on 3193 children in the household
who were born since 1990.
This paper examines the nature and quality of information
obtained from the calendar, focusing specifically on the epi-
demiology of diarrhoea among young children. In the first sec-
tion, we describe the design of the calendar approach used in
the EGSF. Subsequently, we examine various characteristics of
diarrhoeal illness, including the complexity, frequency, and
seriousness of illness, and briefly explore patterns of treatment.
Finally, we discuss our findings with regard to the advantages
and drawbacks of the calendar approach in the study of child
illness.
Questionnaire Design
The questionnaires employed in the EGSF were based on ques-
tions included in previous demographic and health surveys, on
the results of health-related research in Guatemala, and on a
qualitative survey conducted as pan of the EGSF project. The
questionnaires were reviewed by an interdisciplinary team of
researchers, were extensively field tested, and went through
translation and backtranslation procedures in Spanish and two
indigenous languages.7
In the section of the questionnaire devoted to children's ill-
nesses, mothers were asked for detailed information pertaining
to a maximum of two children born since 1990 (Appendix).
They were first asked whether each of eight specific symptoms
related to respiratory or diarrhoeal illness (E1-E8) occurred
during the 2 weeks, and if so, when the symptom began and on
which days during the past 2 weeks the symptom was present.
These symptoms have been shown in other studies to have high
sensitivity and specificity1-2'4'8 and were adapted to the rural
Guatemalan setting on the basis of medical anthropological
research and on the EGSF qualitative study carried out in four
rural Guatemalan communities.9 Respondents reporting at least
one of the eight symptoms during the 2 weeks were asked about
any other symptoms experienced during this time (E10), whether
the symptoms were serious, whether mothers asked others for
advice (E12) or visited providers (E13) regarding their child's ill-
ness, and whether any treatments were administered by the
mother or by anyone else (E14). This information was noted in
the calendar in the appropriate days. Additional information
(such as cost and perceived effectiveness) was subsequently
obtained about each of the people, providers and treatments
recorded in the calendar, and about hospitalization, perceived
causes of illness, and general health status of the child.6
These questions on child illness permit us to address many of
the methodological weaknesses of previous health interview
surveys. For example, Ross and Vaughan3 note that studies often
fail (or are unable) to: (1) identify whether episodes of illness
which began prior to the recall period but extend into the period
are included in reports and measures of illness; and (2) disting-
uish complete from incomplete episodes of illness. The calendar
approach used in the EGSF permits identification of both left
and right censoring of episodes and leads to unbiased estimates
of illness frequency and duration as long as the analyst employs
appropriate life table techniques. Another benefit of this cal-
endar approach is that it permits the analyst to carry out in-
ternal checks of consistency of the data and to thereby assess
the quality of reporting of illness. A third advantage is the ability
of the calendar to capture complex illness histories (i.e. several
partially overlapping symptoms and treatment behaviours),
without the analyst having any a priori definition of an (episode
of) illness. For example, the analyst can explore the sensitivity
of estimates of acute respiratory illness (ARI) to alternative
definitions (i.e. combinations of symptoms). These benefits of
the calendar approach are demonstrated below in the study of
diarrhoeal illness among young Guatemalan children.
Complexity of Reports of Diarrhoeal
Illness
As is generally recognized in the epidemiological literature,
validation of a diarrhoeal episode in community surveys is prob-
lematic because of the difficulty of obtaining daily observations
or stool collections for a large population.81011 This is especially
true for young children, for whom the collection of all soiled
diapers would constitute an excessively intrusive and demand-
ing undertaking. As a result, mothers' or care givers' reports
have been used as the generally accepted procedure for identi-
fying cases of diarrhoea in epidemiological research based on
young children.10'11 Although numerous studies have shown
high agreement between mothers' perceptions about the oc-
currence of diarrhoea and mothers' responses to standardized
questions on the frequency and consistency of stools,8 the latter
approach has generally been preferred.8'10'11
In the EGSF, the occurrence of diarrhoea on any given day in
the last 2 weeks was determined by mothers' responses to
question E6 about whether the child experienced 'asientos', at
least three times on the given day. In extensive field tests prior
to the survey, 'asientos' was shown to be the term for diarrhoea
that was most likely to be understood by the rural Guatemalan
population. For example, when asked to describe the symptoms
associated with 'asientos', mothers were most likely to report
the watery consistency of stools, along with increased frequency
of defecation.9 The use of three or more stools in the definition
of diarrhoea has been shown to lead to high sensitivity and
specificity.8
A definition of a diarrhoeal episode requires further delineation
as to the number of intervening diarrhoea-free days required to
define a new episode. Among the 705 children reporting any
diarrhoea in the 2-week period (22% of children born since
January, 1990), only 20 children (3%) have a gap (of one or
more days) between two occurrences of diarrhoea. Given the
reports of multiple periods of diarrhoea in the EGSF are relat-
ively rare, estimates are very robust to alternative specifications
of the length of the diarrhoea-free period required to define a
new episode. In the remainder of this analysis, we use a defini-
tion of two or more diarrhoea-free days; this definition results
in a total of 722 episodes of diarrhoea during the calendar period.
A salient problem concerning the definition of a diarrhoeal
episode is whether and how to incorporate reports of other
(non-diarrhoeal) symptoms. As shown in Table 1, almost two-
thirds of diarrhoeal episodes have at least one additional symptom
reported within the episode. The majority of these were elicited

b Symptoms reported in column E10 of the calendar, see Appendix
by questions E1-E5 and E7-E8 on specific symptoms; however,
for 10% of episodes, respondents reported a symptom within
the diarrhoeal episode in response to a general question (E10)
about other problems experienced during the illness.
The description of an illness becomes even more complex
when we recognize that symptoms reported in the calendar
period can extend beyond or occur totally outside the period of
diarrhoea. The actual illness history for one child in the EGSF
sample (whom we call Ana) is shown in the Appendix. Ana had
diarrhoea for only 2 days in the calendar but had several other
symptoms for longer periods (including a constant cough for the
past 9 months). Fever occurred both on the days with diarrhoea
and on several days prior to the start of diarrhoea. Moreover,
several days of vomiting--which are likely to be part of the
same illness as diarrhoea--occurred totally outside the episode
of diarrhoea. Such complicated histories are not rare. For ex-
ample, as shown in the last row of Table 1, almost one-fifth of
episodes have a symptom that falls totally outside the period of
diarrhoea. These occurrences point to the ambiguities associated
with the definition of an episode of diarrhoea (or of any other
illness).
Frequency of Diarrhoeal Illness
Tabulations of starting dates, ending dates, and durations of
diarrhoeal episodes (not shown here) indicate some heaping
of responses. The most marked levels of heaping occur for
the starting dates 8 and 15 days before interview (i.e. 1 and
2 weeks). Heaping on the latter date, which occurs just outside
the 2-week calendar, is likely to have arisen because the Spanish
expression used to describe the most recent 2-week period is
'estos ulitmos 15 dfas' (these last 15 days). Asa result of the ap-
parent heaping, we calculated estimates of prevalence for three
alterative periods, excluding the day of interview: the most recent
2-week period (21.8%), the most recent 1-week period
(18.3%), and the penultimate 1-week period (11.6%). These
estimates reveal a substantial underestimate in the next-to-last
week compared with the last week, due to a deficit in reporting
of diarrhoea for this period or to a displacement of days with
diarrhoea from the penultimate to the last week (or to both).
The heaping of reported starting dates on the day prior to the
calendar period (15 days ago) suggests that some of these
episodes probably began within the calendar period and that
estimates for the penultimate week as well as for the entire
2-week period may be too low. On the other hand, the estim-
ated prevalence of 22% from the EGSF for the past 2 weeks is
slightly higher than alternative estimates for Guatemala: 20%
for rural areas according to the 1995 Demographic and Health
Survey (DHS) in Guatemala (based on our own calculation) and
17% for the national sample in the 1987 Demographic and
Health Survey in Guatemala.12
In Table 2, we present estimates of incidence and prevalence
by age for two reference periods that are likely to encompass
the true rates: the last week (which may yield overestimates)
and the last 2 weeks (which may yield underestimates). We
use a risk measure of incidence defined as the probability that a
diarrhoea-free child at the start of the relevant period develops
diarrhoea within the ensuing period.13 The quality of the EGSF
estimates is supported by the finding that all estimates of incid-
ence reveal the expected age pattern of diarrhoeal illness, with
peak rates during the latter half of infancy and the second year
of life. Especially high morbidity from diarrhoea during these
ages occurs in a large number of developing countries, pre-
sumably from poor weaning practices (e.g. inappropriate foods
and unhygienic practices).14"17
In Table 3 we explore differentials in incidence and preval-
ence by whether or not the child is chronically malnourished,
using an indicator of stunting (i.e. more than two standard
deviations below the median height for age as defined by the

NCHS/WHO reference population).18 The estimates in this and
subsequent tables are based on the 2-week recall period. Our
conclusions would remain the same if we had used the last week
as a reference period, but the 2-week period has the advantage
of including longer episodes of diarrhoea (i.e. greater than
7 days) and of larger sample sizes.
The results in Table 3 indicate modest (but not statistically
significant) differences in the frequency of diarrhoea by stunt-
ing, fn spite of clearly established negative associations between
diarrhoea and children's physical growth,19"2' earlier studies
have yielded mixed findings regarding the association between
infection and growth, in part because of variation in the severity
and duration of illness,17'22 as well as frequent reliance on
cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data.23
Life table calculations based on all episodes of diarrhoea begin-
ning in the calendar period (N = 550) indicate that the median
duration is equal to 5.3 days, a value which lies in the range 3-7
days found in other developing countries.4 Differences in dura-
tion by whether or not children are stunted are not statistically
significant.
Seriousness
Since the EGSF asked mothers to determine whether their
child's illness was serious (and to specify the days on which it
was serious), we can compare these reports with characteristics
of the illness to determine the basis on which mothers assessed
severity. The first column of Table 4 indicates the frequency with
which diarrhoeal episodes have different types and numbers of
accompanying symptoms. For example, almost one-third of epi-
sodes are accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom and
a similar proportion by fever. The likelihood that a diarrhoeal
episode was assessed as serious (i.e. contains at least 1 day in
which the mother felt that the symptoms were serious) varies
both by the nature of accompanying symptoms and by the
number of these symptoms. Almost 70% of diarrhoeal episodes
that include additional gastrointestinal symptoms (primarily
vomiting) were considered serious in contrast to about half of
episodes that include respiratory symptoms. The association
between reported severity and the total number of accompany-
ing symptoms is strong and monotonic: for example, whereas
less than one-third of diarrhoeal episodes with no additional

c An episode of diarrhoea may be dassifled according to more man one type

particular type. Only symptoms that fall within the episode of diarrhoea are

symptoms were reported as serious, half of those with two
additional symptoms and more than 90% of those with six
additional symptoms were classified as such. Tabulations (not
shown here) indicate that stunted children were significantly
more likely to have their diarrhoeal episode assessed as serious
than non-stunted children (48% versus 37%, P < 0.01). Life
table estimates (also not shown here) indicate no significant
difference in overall duration by whether or not the mother
reported the episode as serious.
Treatment
Although this analysis focuses on a description of diarrhoeal ill-
ness, a brief examination of treatment behaviour demonstrates
that the benefits of the EGSF data collection strategy extend
to the study of treatment as much as to the assessment of the
characteristics of illness. Unlike many other health interview
surveys, the EGSF recognizes that treatment encompasses a
wide range of providers (i.e. people who offer traditional, pop-
ular and biomedical treatments), as well as advice sought from
friends and relatives, and treatments administered at home
(often by the mother) or elsewhere.24 For example, as shown
in the Appendix, Ana's mother consulted with her husband and
administered three different types of medicine (specified later in
the questionnaire) and a steam bath (temescal) to help cure Ana.

Table 5 presents several summary measures of treatment
behaviour for the entire sample of diarrhoeal episodes; since
treatment is likely to vary by the duration of the episode, this
table is restricted to episodes lasting more than 3 days. The
measures indicate that, on average, mothers sought advice from
one other person (such as a family member, friend or neigh-
bour) and 0.4 providers during the episode. Whereas only
about one-third saw any provider, more than three-quarters of
mothers sought advice from a relative or friend. Virtually all
children received some form of treatment (from the mother or
from another person), and on average they received about two
treatments during the course of the episode. On average, pro-
viders were seen on the third day of the episode, later than the
administration of the first treatment or the seeking of advice
from another source.
Discussion
The analysis of diarrhoeal illness highlights the main advantages
of the calendar approach for the study of child illness. One
notable benefit that has received little attention in the past is
that a calendar permits the analyst to assess the quality of the
resulting data in several respects: (1) evaluation of patterns of
reporting (such as the extent of heaping of responses on par-
ticular days); (2) comparison of estimates with outside sources
that provide information on illness frequency in the past 24
hours, week or 2-week period (or other short periods); and (3)
calculation of internal checks of consistency. For example,
estimates of prevalence from the EGSF for sub-periods within
the 2-week calendar suggest that reporting is more complete for
days closer to the time of interview. Although a 2-week recall
period is recommended by most epidemiologists for interview
reports of child illness, this analysis and other studies indicate
that memory lapses may occur within this relatively short time
span.25 In contrast to information ascertained from fixed recall
periods, the calendar approach permits the analyst to alter the
reference period for estimates (e.g. by focusing on the last week
rather than the last 2 weeks) subsequent to data collection.
An equally important advantage of the calendar is that it
provides a much richer description of illness (and treatment
behaviour) than is possible with many other types of ques-
tionnaires. While results from longitudinal studies demonstrate
the frequent recurrence and overlapping of different illnesses or
symptoms, cross-sectional surveys have typically presented a
very oversimplified description of illness. The Demographic and
Health Surveys, for example, present separate results for the fre-
quency of diarrhoeal and respiratory illnesses for a given child,
without explicitly recognizing that these symptoms often over-
lap. Results from the EGSF demonstrate that the definition of
(an episode of) illness is complex and that classification of illnes-
ses into distinct categories (such as diarrhoeal versus respiratory),
with the corresponding starting and ending dates, may not
constitute the most meaningful strategy for understanding child
illness. Such classification schemes become even more unsatis-
factory when the analyst attempts to ascribe reports of illness
causation, seriousness, and treatment to particular symptoms or
episodes.
The survey design implemented in the EGSF is not without its
drawbacks. As suggested above, memory problems are likely to
persist in any health survey that obtains information retro-
spectively, even those that incorporate a short recall period. One
apparent limitation of the EGSF is the tediousness of obtaining
detailed illness histories from more than one child in the family.
Estimates (not presented here) indicate that this repetition
probably led to underreporting in the EGSF: the frequency of
reported illness is lower for the penultimate as compared with
the last child, even when age, birth order and other relevant
characteristics are controlled. While the redundancy could have
been eliminated by restricting questions to a randomly selected
child born during the relevant period (January, 1990 to inter-
view date),26 this strategy precludes any analysis of family
effects related to illness and treatment--an important objective
of the EGSF and of other epidemiological and social science
investigations.
In spite of these problems, the analysis presented here
indicates the usefulness of calendar formats for measuring child
illness. Conventional estimates pertaining to diarrhoea--such
as prevalence in the past 2 weeks, age patterns and average
duration--can be readily derived from the calendar format.
These estimates for the EGSF appear to be of high quality, e.g.
they are consistent with those obtained from other sources in
Guatemala and elsewhere. At the same time, the calendar
format provides much more information about illnesses and
treatment behaviour than do more conventional instruments,
such as the questionnaires for the Demographic and Health
Survey project which have been used in over 50 developing
countries during the past decade. Since epidemiologists are rely-
ing to a greater extent than in previous years on single-round
household interviews, rather than more costly longitudinal
investigations and field surveys, additional implementation and
evaluation of calendar formats is warranted to provide the most
useful and accurate data possible at relatively low cost.
