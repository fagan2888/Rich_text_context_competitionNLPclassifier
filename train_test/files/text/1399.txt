Background. This investigation was designed to identify individual and contextual factors associated with airline passengers'
alcohol use, and to explore potentially dangerous in-flight alcohol consumption.
Methods. Passengers waiting to board 24 domestic flights at an international airport in the South Atlantic United States were
asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Eighty percent of those approached agreed to participate. Our findings are based
upon the responses of 1,548 adults.
Results. A majority (84%) of passengers indicated that they did not intend to consume alcoholic beverages on the plane they were
waiting to board. Passengers who were more likely to report that they would drink were on longer flights, traveling with friends,
and anticipating First or Business Class seating. Passengers who had already consumed alcohol that day and those who drank more
often generally were also more likely to say that they intended to consume alcohol, as were people who thought that in-flight
alcohol use was enjoyable, acceptable, and unlikely to make jet lag worse. Eighty-nine percent of the passengers who said they
intended to drink reported that they would purchase one to two drinks.
Conclusions. Very few respondents reported intentions that would pose a risk to others. Future studies should validate alcohol
consumption and sample passengers at multiple airports throughout the year.
There has been virtually no scientific scrutiny of
alcohol use among airline passengers.1,2 This topic
has received some attention in the lay press, usually
when incidents of ``air rage'' are attributed to excess
alcohol consumption. Disruptive passenger behavior
can range from noncompliance with safety instructions
to the physical assault of airline staff.
Although there are indications that such incidents
may have declined in recent years,3 they were described
as having reached ``epidemic proportions'' at the
2000 International Aircraft Safety Symposium.4 The
International Air Transport Association reported a
fivefold increase in air rage incidents between 1994 and
1997.5 In that same time period, a voluntary government
reporting system in the United States recorded an 800%
increase in reports of unruly passenger behavior.6
Although it has been acknowledged that too little
is known about air rage,7 two separate surveys of
airline employees cited alcohol as its major cause.8,9
In the United Kingdom, alcohol was identified
as a contributory factor in 45% of the incidents
reported to the government between 1999 and
2003.3 Similarly, when US officials analyzed a year's

worth of voluntary reports on passenger misconduct,
``overindulgence in alcoholic beverages'' emerged as
``the most prevalent contributory factor. . .by far.''4 An
analysis of newspaper accounts of air rage cases in
Canada cited ``drunkenness/being cut off from alcohol''
as their most common precipitating event.10 Anglin and
colleagues have characterized our understanding of this
problem as being analogous to ``where the drunk driving
problem was 40 years ago.''11
Disruptive passenger behavior is just one of several
public health issues that may be related to airline pas-
sengers' use of alcohol. Many people drive home from
airports after deplaning. Almost half of all rental car
revenue in the United States is generated at airports,12
yet we have no data on the proportion of those leav-
ing airports who are intoxicated. In one civil lawsuit
that was brought against an airline for overserving
a passenger who went on to drive while intoxicated,
the plaintiff's private investigator was reportedly served
12 drinks while sitting in the first class cabin for a
90-minute flight.13 In New Mexico, authorities halted
alcohol sales on two airlines after a recently deplaned
passenger caused a crash that killed a family of five.14
His blood alcohol level was four times the state's legal
limit, and witnesses reported that he had been served
alcohol in-flight despite appearing intoxicated.
Another potential concern is a passenger's ability
to evacuate a commercial aircraft in the event of an
emergency. In one report of a runway collision that
resulted in a fire, 76% of the passengers in a Boeing 737

were able to escape to safety. Among the fatalities was a
first class passenger with a blood alcohol level of 0.24%,
who had not even unfastened his seat belt.2 This issue is
particularly relevant for people sitting in the overwing
exit row, who assume responsibility for operating that
hatch when they agree to sit in those seats. This task
has been documented as challenging from both physical
and cognitive perspectives.15,16
We were also interested in whether airline passengers
who drink alcohol are less likely to wear their seat belts,
as has been documented for automobile occupants.17­19
Unbelted airline passengers are at increased risk for
turbulence injuries, which can be fatal.20 That aspect of
our study has been published elsewhere.21 In brief, we
found that airline passengers who intended to consume
alcohol on their upcoming flight were twice as likely to
report that they ``rarely or never'' wore their seat belts
when the seat belt sign was not illuminated.
A final reason to increase our understanding of
airline passengers' alcohol use is that air travelers
are often advised to forgo alcohol consumption in
hopes of reducing their risk of developing deep vein
thrombosis.22
Methods
Since the aircraft cabin environment has not been
studied in relation to alcohol consumption, we felt it was
important to collect qualitative data before beginning
our quantitative study. To this end, we held three focus
groups with airline passengers. Their input, and our
review of the general alcohol literature, resulted in
the list of candidate independent variables displayed in
Table 1. We developed a survey instrument to measure
these factors, using standardized items when they were
available.23

These variables were added or refined as a result of our focus groups.
Our survey instrument and study procedures were
approved by the human subjects committee of the
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.
Our questionnaire was distributed to passengers who
were waiting to board 24 domestic flights at a major
international airport located in the South Atlantic
United States. Flights were selected to cover a range of
destinations, lengths, and dates/times of departure, but
those departing before noon were excluded from the
study. Our data were collected from November 2005
through March 2006.
Interviewers were trained to approach all adult
passengers who appeared to be waiting for the study
flight. Passengers were eligible if they confirmed that
they were ticketed for the study flight, were at least
21 years of age, could speak and read English or Spanish,
and were not airline employees. Data collection began
approximately 2 hours before the flight's scheduled
departure and continued until the flight's last passengers
had boarded. Our introduction informed passengers of
the study's voluntary and anonymous nature. They were
also informed of the study's sponsor, focus (ie, ``airline
passenger behavior''), length (``less than 10 min'') and
the fact that they would receive a gourmet coffee coupon
worth $3 if they agreed to participate.
In an attempt to confirm that reported intentions
to consume alcohol were well correlated with actual
in-flight behavior, we provided 20% of passengers with
a $10 gift check and invited them to call a toll-free
number after deplaning. Those who called were asked
for their coupon number (ie, so that their responses
could be linked to their preflight survey), whether they
had consumed any alcohol on the study flight, and (if so)
the type and amount. We also purchased alcohol sales
data--by flight--from the airline.
We used chi-square and t-tests to explore asso-
ciations between independent variables and reported
intentions to consume alcohol in-flight. Factors with
bivariate associations of p < 0.10 were entered into a
logistic regression model. Three of our four measures
of usual/past alcohol consumption habits were excluded
due to collinearity, and we reduced our model several
times to produce a final model that included only factors
independently associated with drinking intentions at the
p < 0.05 level. A Hosmer-Lemeshow test of our fitted
model was also conducted. To account for the possible
effects of clustering (ie, unmeasured common traits that
might be shared by passengers on the same flights),
we used the Huber-White robust variance estimator.24
Potentially dangerous patterns of alcohol consumption
will also be described.
Results
Sample
Of the 2,013 passengers to whom we offered survey
participation, 80% ( n = 1, 615) agreed. Usable surveys
were collected from 96% of those volunteers, resulting

Airline Passengers' Alcohol Use 313
in a final sample size of 1,548. Participants are described
in Table 2.
Factors Associated with Alcohol Consumption
Fourteen percent ( n = 212) of respondents responded
that they intended to consume alcoholic beverages on
the flight they were waiting to board. Male passengers
( p = 0.07), those who were White ( p = 0.01), non-
Hispanics (p = 0.03), and respondents who reported
higher household incomes ( p < 0.01), were more likely
to answer this question in the affirmative. Participants
were more likely to report drinking intentions if they
were not ``jittery right now'' ( p < 0.01) and did not
agree that ``airlines charge a lot for alcoholic beverages''
( p < 0.01). The outcome expectancies that were
positively associated with reported alcohol intentions
included believing that alcohol is: relaxing ( p < 0.01),
increases their enjoyment of flying ( p < 0.01), makes
them more friendly to the person sitting next to
them ( p < 0.01), does not increase their aggressiveness
( p < 0.01), does not have more of an effect if consumed
during a flight (p < 0.01), and does not make jet
lag worse ( p < 0.01). Our social norm items were
also significantly associated with drinking intentions
[ie, reporting that the respondent would not feel
embarrassed if other passengers thought they were
drunk ( p < 0.01), and thinking that passengers ``should
feel free'' to have a couple of drinks when they are flying
( p < 0.01)]. Most of our questions relating to usual
(ie, nonaviation) drinking habits were associated with
preflight drinking intentions: more frequent alcohol use
( p < 0.01), consuming more drinks on a ``typical'' day
of drinking ( p < 0.01), frequency of drinking ``five or
more drinks on one occasion'' ( p < 0.01), and having
consumed a higher number of drinks in a 1 day period
in the last 12 months ( p < 0.01). Finally, passengers
who believed that being sober did not offer a survival
advantage in the event of an emergency landing were
more likely to report that they intended to drink on the
flight they were waiting to board ( p < 0.01).
Situational characteristics that were associated with a
significantly higher likelihood of respondents reporting
that they were going to drink on board the plane
included: evening flights ( p < 0.01), longer flights
( p < 0.01), sitting in First or Business class ( p <
0.01), having a nonaisle seat ( p = 0.07), having no
work responsibilities on the day of the flight ( p =
0.06), traveling with friends ( p = 0.02), flying under
conditions that are associated with alcohol use in the
United States (eg, to a football playoff, to Las Vegas,
on New Year's Eve) ( p = 0.02), and having already
consumed alcohol on the day of the flight ( p < 0.01).
Passenger characteristics that were measured but
found to be nonsignificant included age, gender,
education, being ``a nervous flyer,'' taking care not
to get dehydrated when flying, having concerns about
the quality of the drinking water served on planes, being
in a ``bad mood,'' being nicotine-dependent,25 being
alcohol-dependent, and knowing the fine for interfering
with a flight attendant. Nonsignificant contextual factors
included weekend (vs nonweekend), trip purpose,
intending to sleep, celebrating something, leaving versus
coming home, being seated in an emergency exit row,
having a nonaisle seat, and planning to drive home from
the airport.
The factors that emerged as being significantly
associated with intended alcohol consumption after we
performed the exploratory regression analyses described
under Methods are displayed in Table 3. Our final
regression model was estimated using data from 1,444
surveys, because 7% of study participants were missing
responses to key variables.
We found that endorsing social norms that condoned
in-flight drinking, holding positive outcome expectan-
cies (or not endorsing negative statements about alco-
hol), traveling with friends, sitting (or hoping to be
seated) in First or Business Class, longer flights, drinking
more alcohol in other contexts, and having consumed
alcohol earlier in the day were associated with reported
intentions to drink on the flight that respondents were
waiting to board. This same set of variables remained
significant after our standard errors were adjusted for
cluster sampling.
Dangerous Patterns of Alcohol Use?
Of those who said they intended to drink, the average
level of consumption reported was 1.6 drinks ( SD =
1.04). When passenger levels of intended consumption
were divided by flight length, 95% of respondents
reported that they would consume less than one drink
per hour.

It is worth noting, however, that 14% of respondents
had already consumed alcohol on the day of their flight.
According to their surveys, 78% had had one drink, and
half had consumed their last drink within an hour of
completing the survey. Almost half of these passengers
reported having had their drinks in the airport; a third
had had their drinks on a plane.
The alcohol use of certain subgroups of airline
passengers was of particular interest because they pose
a potential threat to other people. These included
passengers sitting in an overwing (``emergency'') exit
row, people with a history of aggressive behavior after
using alcohol, and those who planned to drive a motor
vehicle from their destination airport. Passengers who
reported that they had gotten into a ``physical fight''
while drinking or right after drinking in the last
3 years were not significantly more likely to report that
they would consume alcohol on their upcoming flight.
Passengers among that group who did intend to drink,
however, said they would order 2.6 (SD = 2.4) drinks
on average, versus 1.6 (SD = 0.91) for other passengers.
Three of those who reported a history of fighting after
drinking ( n = 49) said that they intended to drink more
than a drink per hour.
Agreeing that, ``Drinking tends to increase my
aggressiveness,'' was negatively associated with intending
to consume alcohol on the upcoming flight. Two
passengers who endorsed that statement, however,
intended to drink more than one drink per hour of
flight.
Passengers sitting in overwing exit rows were not
significantly less likely to drink than their fellow
passengers. The amount of alcohol they said they would
consume, however (1.2 drinks on average, SD = 0.44),
would not be expected to render them impaired.
Passengers who expected to drive away from the
airport upon reaching their final destination did not
differ significantly from nondriving respondents, with
regard to whether they intended to drink in-flight, or
the amount they said they would consume (1.6 drinks,
SD = 1). Three of these respondents reported that they
would consume more than a drink per hour of flight.
We collected height and weight data to estimate26
crude blood alcohol levels for our respondents. These
calculations suggest that three respondents would
achieve a blood alcohol level that exceeded 0.08 (ie,
the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle in the
United States) over the course of their flight (factoring
in drinks that passengers reported consuming just before
boarding). One of these passengers said that he planned
to drive home from his destination airport.
Validating Our Outcome of Interest
Our attempts to verify whether reported intentions to
consume alcohol in-flight were well correlated with
actual in-flight consumption met with mixed results. Of
the 281 passengers who received gift checks requesting
that they participate in a brief telephone survey after
deplaning, only 27% ( n = 77) complied. A comparison
of their preflight intentions to drink and their postflight
reports, however, showed 91% agreement, which is
significantly higher than would have been expected by
chance (  = 0.314, z = 2.73, p < .01).
More objectively, we were able to purchase data on
the number of drinks sold to coach passengers for 18
of our 24 study flights. These figures correlated with
the number of intended drink purchases reported by
study participants ( r = 0.59, p < 0.01). We also found
significant correlations within two of three categories of
alcoholic beverages. When we calculated the correlation
between drinks sold per economy passenger and
drinks reported per economy survey respondent, our
J Travel Med 2009; 16: 311­316
Airline Passengers' Alcohol Use 315
correlation was 0.83 ( p < 0.01). We were encouraged by
these results, because our study volunteers represented
only a subset of the passengers who actually flew and
were eligible to purchase alcohol on-board.
Finally, the dose response curve observed between
how much alcohol respondents said they usually drink,
and whether they intended to drink on their flight, also
suggested that passengers were being candid.
Discussion
Some of the factors that have been associated with
alcohol consumption in nonaviation contexts (e.g. prior
history of alcohol consumption, product pricing) were
also found to operate among this sample of airline
passengers. Other significant findings may appear
unique to this setting (eg, perceived association with jet
lag), but most are consistent with previously recognized
patterns of association (ie, positive alcohol expectations,
social norms).
Some variables that usually show association with
alcohol intake--such as gender--dropped out of our
model. Although it is possible that this pattern is the
result of previously identified phenomena (eg, gender
convergence operating among this upper socioeconomic
status sample), it may also derive from the aviation
setting. Previous studies have shown that drinking
context can have important effects on alcohol intake,27
and that subgroups of alcohol users prefer to drink in
different venues.28,29
The fact that alcohol dependence was not associated
with increased reporting of intention to drink in-flight
may be attributable to our measurement tool. CAGE
(cut down, annoyed, guilty and eye opener) has proven
to be more valid when applied to clinical (vs. general)
populations and is not recommended as a screening test
for ``heavy or hazardous drinking.''30,31 Fear of flying
and nicotine addiction were also nonsignificant, which
is interesting because there has been speculation that
airline passengers might self-medicate with alcohol in
response to such stressors.
Although airline passengers' alcohol use has not been
studied in the past, our findings share at least two results
with the nascent air rage literature. A study of major
Canadian carriers reported that most events occur on
flights that exceed 3 hours in length.1 In both Canada
and the United Kingdom, it has been reported that
passengers who were traveling with others were more
likely to become involved in disruptive incidents.1,32
Limitations
This study has a number of limitations. It relies upon
self-reports of intentions to consume alcohol. The alcohol
literature contains numerous reports which demonstrate
that intentions to behave are well associated with
subsequent behavior. Such associations are particularly
likely when the actions under study follow reported
intentions closely in time,33 when they are measured in
the same referent context,34 and when the behavior is
under the respondent's control.
Our data were collected at one airport in the United
States, from one airline's passengers. We did not include
morning flights in this study nor did we collect data
during the spring or summer. These constraints call
the generalizability of our findings into question. When
our sample is compared to the flying public nationwide,
they are similar with regard to travel purpose and
age distribution but different with regard to traveling
companions, household income, and education.35 For
these reasons, it is advisable to focus on the associations
identified in this study rather than our prevalence
estimates.
Those associations suggest that many of the major
covariates of alcohol use on commercial aircraft are
modifiable (eg, alcohol expectancies and the amount of
time that passengers have access to beverage service in
flight). Future studies should attempt to measure alcohol
consumption directly, expand to multiple airports and
airlines, and collect data year-round.
Conclusions
If the results of future work support the findings of this
study, we might conclude that problematic drinking in
the aviation context is relatively rare. This is consistent
with studies of air rage, one of which estimated that
1 in every 138,308 airline passengers is involved in a
passenger misconduct incident.1 A second investigation
concluded that one serious on-board incident occurs for
every 2 million passengers carried.3
In the United States alone, however, 650 million
people fly each year and that number is expected
to increase. Even small proportions of such a large
population should not be ignored.
