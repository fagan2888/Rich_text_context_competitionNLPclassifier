Abstract
Objective: To assess the application of antibacterial agents, alongside pathogen prevalence and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa drug resistance, with the aim of understanding the impact of inappropriate
antibacterial use.
Methods: This retrospective study assessed bacteria from wounds, catheters, blood, faeces, urine
and sputum of hospitalized patients in burn wards between 2007 and 2014. The intensity of use of
antibacterial agents and resistance of P. aeruginosa to common anti-Gram-negative antibiotics were
measured.
Results: Annual detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus were significantly decreased, whereas
annual detection rates of P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were significantly increased.
Multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were increased. The intensity of use of some anti-
Gramnegative antibiotics positively correlated with resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to similar
antimicrobials.
Conclusion: In burn wards, more attention should be paid to P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. The
use of ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and cefoperazone/sulbactam should be limited to counter the
related increase in resistance levels.

Introduction
Although treatment for burns has been
greatly improved, infection remains one of
the main causes of death in burn patients,
especially in critically-ill burn patients.1­3
Indeed, compared with other hospitalized
individuals, burn patients are characterized
by skin deficiency, long hospital stays and
multiple invasive operations, and are there-
fore more prone to infection. In addition,
common bacterial species from burn patient
wounds are constantly changing during the
course of disease: initially, the burn wound
is sterile, but it becomes colonized with
Gram-positive bacteria such as b-haemoly-
tic Streptococcus after 48 h.4 With the appli-
cation of surgical debridement and skin
grafting in early surgery, as well as extensive
use of systemic antibiotics and other treat-
ment interventions, Gram-negative bacteria
such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be
detected.5 During treatment, bacterial resist-
ance also changes with the application of
significant amounts of antibacterial agents.6
Furthermore, bacterial prevalence differs
between the burn wards of different hospitals:
some are dominated by Gram-negative bac-
teria,7 while others predominantly report
Gram-positive organisms.8 Therefore, in the
treatment for burns, regular monitoring of
bacterial epidemiology in hospital wards is
critical for the rational use of antibiotics.9
In our burn ward, P. aeruginosa is the most
prevalent bacteria,10 and it is particularly
difficult to treat. Indeed, P. aeruginosa
harbours many virulence factors, including
elastase, exotoxin A, phospholipase and
homoserine lactone.11 In addition, this organ-
ism possesses a variety of drug resistance
mechanisms: inactivation or suppression of
enzyme production, increased expression of
an active efflux pump system, biofilm forma-
tion, and loss or decreased expression of outer
membrane proteins.12,13 Therefore, multi-
drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-
resistant (XDR) strains are common. Burn
patients infected with P. aeruginosa show a
higher mortality rate.14 Therefore, the devel-
opment of effectively therapeutic strategies to
treat P. aeruginosa infection has been the
focus of our study group.
The widespread application of antibac-
terial agents has resulted in increasing levels
and severity of bacterial resistance,15,16 which
in turn, demands greater use of antibacterial
agents, further aggravating bacterial resist-
ance in a vicious cycle.6 Thus, it is essential
to select appropriate antibacterial agents, to
avoid increased patient mortality17 and the
economic burden on patients and society.18
However, in one study, more than 40% of
antibacterial agents used in a hospital were
reported to be inappropriate.19 Similarly, a
report from Tehran indicated that 40% of
antibacterial agent use was inappropriate.20
In the United States, irrational application
of antibacterial agents has also been
observed.21 These deficiencies in the rational
use of antibacterial agents are often accom-
panied by adverse consequences, including
high mortality22 and increased medical
costs.18 Therefore, it is not only necessary
to monitor bacterial prevalence and drug
resistance in hospital wards, but also anti-
bacterial agent use. An increasing number of
countries and researchers are now attempt-
ing to simultaneously monitor antibacterial
agent use together with bacterial epidemio-
logical data, with the aim of guiding policy
development for the use of antibacterial
agents.23 However, many previous studies
assessing anti-infective treatments for
burns7,8 only monitored the prevalence and
drug resistance of common bacteria in wards
and neglected antibacterial use, making it
difficult to understand the impact of
inappropriate use of antibacterial agents in
these cases.
In this retrospective study, we statistically
analysed the use of antibacterial agents
and bacterial epidemiology in wards
treating burn patients. In particular, the
use of antibacterial agents and drug resist-
ance of P. aeruginosa were simultaneously
Dou et al. 1125
evaluated, identifying any inappropriate
antibacterial use. Through this combined
analysis, we aimed to provide reliable data
to guide policy development for the rational
use of antibacterial agents in burn wards.
Materials & methods
Bacterial sample collection
The study was retrospective. Bacterial sam-
ples were collected from hospitalized patients
in the burn wards of Ruijin Hospital,
Shanghai Jiaotong University School of
Medicine, from January 2007 to December
2014. A total of 10276 hospitalized patients
were enrolled, including 6935 men and 3341
women, aged 1­111 years (34.13Æ 20.59).
Upon admission, the patients received rou-
tine preventative treatment which comprised
lincomycin, and further treatment was
adjusted according to antibiotic susceptibility
test results. This study was approved by the
institutional review board of Ruijin Hospital,
Shanghai Jiaotong University, School of
Medicine and written informed consent was
obtained from every participant.
Wound secretion specimens were collected
for microbial culture at the first dressing
change after admission, and subsequently on
a weekly basis. Wound specimens were col-
lected by sterile swabs from the wound
surface after the removal of the dressing. In
patients with central venous catheters, germi-
culture was also carried out with catheteriza-
tion specimens and blood samples from
ipsilateral/contralateral limbs when the cath-
eter was extracted. In individuals with hyper-
pyrexia, diarrhoea, pulmonary infection
(evidenced by a chest X-ray) and urinary
tract infection, germiculture was also per-
formed on blood, faecal, sputum and mid-
stream urine samples, respectively.
Bacterial strain isolation and identification
All samples were routinely inoculated onto
Mueller­Hinton agar medium (Oxoid, UK)
and incubated at 35C for 24 h. After
bacterial strain isolation and purification,
identification was carried our using an API
bacterial identification strip on a Vitek-2
fully-automatic germ analysis system
(Biomerieux, France). Identical bacterial
identification in different samples from the
same patient indicated a positive result.
Drug susceptibility test
Drug susceptibility was determined by the
Kirby­Bauer disk diffusion method (filter
paper purchased from Oxoid), in accord-
ance with Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.24
A total of six antibiotics were selected for
assessing the drug resistance of P. aerugi-
nosa, including amikacin (30 mg), cef-
tazidime (30 mg), cefoperazone/sulbactam
(75/30 mg), imipenem (10 mg), meropenem
(10 mg) and ciprofloxacin (5 mg). Standard
strains for quality control were Escherichia
coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC
27853 and Staphylococcus aureus, which
were all provided by the Shanghai Centre
for Clinical Laboratory. The results were
expressed as the rate of resistant strains
among all detected P. aeruginosa strains.
MDR strains of P. aeruginosa were also
calculated annually. The definition of MDR
is resistance to three or more antimicrobial
classes.
Antibacterial use density analysis
As recommended by the World Health
Organisation,25 the annual use densities of
common antibiotics from 2007 to 2014 were
calculated and expressed in defined daily
doses/1000 patient-days (DDDs/1000 PD).
The assessed antibiotics were vancomycin,
penicillin, teicoplanin, imipenem, merope-
nem, lincomycin, minocycline, azithromy-
cin, ciprofloxacin, cefradine, cefuroxime,
ceftazidime, cefoperazone/sulbactam and
amikacin.

Data analysis
The WHONET 5.6 software was used to
assess the following parameters: (1) detec-
tion of pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa,
in the ward during each year; and (2)
changes in the P. aeruginosa resistance
rates for antibacterial agents. Statistical
analysis was performed using the SPSS
19.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Time-trend analysis through curve
estimation was performed for the percentage
of specific bacteria among all detected
pathogens, antibacterial use density,
P. aeruginosa resistance to specific anti-
biotics and MDR strains of P. aeruginosa.
Pearson correlation analyses were per-
formed between indexes when they followed
a normal distribution in the Kolmogorov­
Smirnov Z test. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Annual changes in specific bacteria
From 2007 to 2014, a total of 3005 patho-
genic strains were isolated, including 2561,
80, 6, 6, 98, 5, 30 and 220 from wound
secretions, catheters, drainage fluid, throat
swabs, blood, faecal, urine and sputum
samples, respectively.
The number of detected strains for each
bacterial species, and the percentage of
specific bacteria among all detected patho-
gens, were calculated annually (Table 1 &
Figure 1).
Although S. aureus was the predominant
species throughout the years, its percentage
detection significantly decreased year by
year, from 43.67% in 2007 to 28.81% in
2014 (Logistic, R2 ¼ 0.517, p < 0.05). A simi-
lar decreasing trend was found for the
detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis,
with the rate reducing from 8.98% in 2007
to 3.97% in 2014 (Logistic, R2 ¼ 0.601,
p < 0.05). By contrast, annual changes in
the detection rates for P. aeruginosa and
Klebsiella pneumoniae showed the opposite
trend. The detection rate of P. aeruginosa
significantly increased from 10.20% in 2007
to 26.16% in 2014 (Logistic, R2 ¼ 0.952,
p < 0.01); with this bacterium being the
predominant species among Gram-negative
bacteria by 2014. The detection rate of
K. pneumoniae also significantly increased
from 3.67% in 2007 to 12.25% in 2014
(Logistic, R2 ¼ 0.760, p < 0.01), which was
the second highest detection rate among
Gram-negative bacteria. No significant
changes in the detection rates were found
for the other bacterial species assessed.
Given that P. aeruginosa showed the
most significant increase in the detection
rate, our subsequent analyses focused on
this bacterium.
Annual changes in the use densities
of common antibiotics
From 2007 to 2014, the use densities of com-
mon antibiotics (vancomycin, penicillin,
teicoplanin, imipenem, meropenem, linco-
mycin, minocycline, azithromycin, cipro-
floxacin, cefradine, cefuroxime,
ceftazidime, cefoperazone/sulbactam and
amikacin) in our department varied, as
shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.
Interestingly, the use densities of amikacin
(mainly used against Gram-negative bac-
teria) and cephalosporins (used for both
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bac-
teria), such as ceftazidime, cefoperazone/
sulbactam and cefuroxime, were signifi-
cantly increased throughout the years.
Specifically, use density of amikacin
increased from 8.65 in 2007 to 49.41 in
2014 (Logistic, R2 ¼ 0.506, p < 0.05), and
that of ceftazidime from 21.84 in 2007 to
72.05 in 2014 (Linear, R2 ¼ 0.673, p < 0.05).
The values obtained for cefoperazone/sul-
bactam were 17.35 and 50.62 in 2007 and
2014, respectively (Linear, R2 ¼ 0.615,

remaining antibiotics showed no significant
increasing or decreasing trends.
As shown in Table 2, the use density of
vancomycin ranked highest throughout the
years, except in 2007 and 2012; the use
density of lincomycin also ranked highly.
The use densities of meropenem, imipenem
and teicoplanin ranked moderately, whereas
penicillin, azithromycin, minocycline, cipro-
floxacin and cefradine showed lower use
densities.
Annual changes in P. aeruginosa drug
resistance
From 2007 to 2014, the resistance rates of
P. aeruginosa to six common anti-Gram-
negative antibiotics are shown in Table 3 and
Figure 3, including amikacin, ceftazidime,
cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem, merope-
nem and ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, the
resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to amikacin
(Linear, R2 ¼ 0.805, p < 0.01), cefoperazone/
sulbactam (Linear, R2 ¼ 0.860, p < 0.01), imi-
penem (Linear, R2 ¼ 0.874, p < 0.01) and
meropenem (Linear, R2 ¼ 0.861, p < 0.01)
were significantly increased. By contrast, the
resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to ceftazi-
dime and ciprofloxacin showed no significant
trend from 2007 to 2011, but started to rise
from 2012, as shown in Figure 3. These
findings indicated that P. aeruginosa resist-
ance to antibiotics targeting Gram-negative
bacteria generally increased over the time
period assessed.
Annual changes in the prevalence
of MDR strains of P. aeruginosa
The number and percentage of detected
MDR strains of P. aeruginosa were calcu-
lated annually (Table 4). The percentage of
MDR strains significantly increased (Linear,
R2 0.806, P < 0.01) from 64.00% in 2007 to
89.87% in 2014.
Correlation analyses
Table 5 shows the results of Pearson correl-
ation analyses between the percentage of
P. aeruginosa strains detected and the use
densities of common antibiotics. Interestingly,
the P. aeruginosa detection rate showed a
positive correlation with the use intensities
of cefuroxime (r ¼ 0.89, p < 0.01), ceftazi-
dime (r ¼ 0.82, p < 0.05) and cefoperazone/
sulbactam (r ¼ 0.73, p < 0.05); however, no
significant associations were found for the
remaining antibiotics tested.
Table 6 shows the results of Pearson
correlation analyses between the percentage
of P. aeruginosa strains resistant to specific
antibiotics and the use densities of common
anti-Gram-negative antibiotics. Interestingly,
the intensity of use of ciprofloxacin was
positively correlated with the resistance

Discussion
Infection is one of the main causes of death
in burn patients.1­3 Simultaneously moni-
toring the use of antibacterial agents and
bacterial epidemiology6,23 can help effect-
ively understand bacterial resistance and the
inappropriate use of antibacterial agents,
hereby enabling specific application of anti-
bacterial agents. Specific and appropriate
antibacterial use would achieve the pur-
poses of fighting infection and mitigating
drug resistance, avoiding the harm caused
by irrational use of antibacterial agents.
However, most reports on burn infections7,8
only monitored the prevalence and drug
resistance of common bacteria, not taking
into consideration the use of antibacterial
agents in burn wards. In this study, we
combined the analysis of antibacterial agent
use and resistance of P. aeruginosa, an
important bacterial species detected in our
burn wards.10 Our data provide insight into
inappropriate use of antibacterial agents,
and may provide guidance for more effective
therapeutic strategies that may help alleviate
bacterial resistance.
We focused on P. aeruginosa because
prevalence rates revealed a significant
increasing trend, followed by K. pneumo-
niae, another Gram-negative bacterium. By
contrast, Gram-positive S. aureus and
S. epidermidis showed a significant decreasing
trend in prevalence. This was in agreement
with a recent study of pathogen prevalence
and drug resistance in a burn ward, which
reported 33.9%, 52.7% and 13.4% Gram-
positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi,
respectively.26 Studies have reported that
burn patients infected with Gram-negative
bacteria, especially P. aeruginosa,27 have a
higher risk of death. Thus, more attention
should be paid to Gram-negative bacteria,
especially P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae,
in determining antibiotic use in burn wards.

Our results revealed that the use inten-
sities of amikacin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime
and cefoperazone/sulbactam showed
increasing trends. This might be due to
extensive detection of Gram-negative bac-
teria, as these agents are commonly
employed to treat Gram-negative bacterial
infections. Consistent with this, correlation
analysis revealed that the detection rate of
P. aeruginosa positively correlated with the
use intensities of cefuroxime (r ¼ 0.89, p <
0.01), ceftazidime (r ¼ 0.82, p < 0.05) and
cefoperazone/sulbactam (r ¼ 0.73, p < 0.05).
Although the intensity of use of vancomycin
did not significantly increase, it remained
high and ranked first for all of the years
assessed except 2007 and 2012. This might
be attributed to the fact that S. aureus
always ranked first among the detected
pathogens, although its rates of detection
decreased over time.
It has been reported that P. aeruginosa
strains detected in burn patients are usually
MDR, i.e. show resistance to ciprofloxacin,
cephalexin, aztreonam and ceftriaxone,28
and are associated with higher mortality,29
longer hospital stays and an increased
number of ventilator days.30 Patients with
resistant P. aeruginosa infection have a poor
prognosis and it is therefore increasingly
important that close attention is paid to
P. aeruginosa strains displaying severe drug
resistance. Unfortunately, our study showed
that the percentage of MDR P. aeruginosa
strains in our burn ward had increased
significantly from 64.00% in 2007 to
89.87% in 2014. In this study, P. aeruginosa
presented a significantly increasing trend in
resistance rates to amikacin, cefoperazone/
sulbactam, imipenem and meropenem. The
resistance rates to ceftazidime and cipro-
floxacin were also increased from 2012 to
2014. Extensive use of antibacterial agents
gradually leads to bacterial resistance.15,16
We speculate that the observed increased
resistance rates may result from the con-
tinuous and significant overuse of these
antibiotics; and for ceftazidime and cipro-
floxacin, this overuse appeared to be rela-
tively serious from 2010 to 2012 (Figure 2).
We further assessed the correlation
between intensity of use of ceftazidime or
ciprofloxacin, and the resistance rates of
P. aeruginosa. Our results revealed that the
intensity of use of ceftazidime was not
significantly correlated with the resistance
rates of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime, and the
intensity of use of ciprofloxacin was nega-
tively correlated with the resistance rates of
P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. These find-
ings do not contradict the association of
drug resistance and use intensities of these
two antibiotics because it may take time to
increase P. aeruginosa resistance upon anti-
bacterial overuse. For cefoperazone/sulbac-
tam, the intensity of use positively correlated
with the cefoperazone/sulbactam resistance
rate, indicating that resistance levels to
certain antibiotics may increase without
delay in P. aeruginosa.
The different timings for the appearance
of drug resistance following drug overuse
in P. aeruginosa may be attributed to
the different antibiotic mechanisms. Drug
resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa
include: inactivating or inhibitory enzymes,
increased active efflux pump system expres-
sion, changing target of antibacterial agents,
biofilm formation, and loss or decreased
outer membrane protein expression.12,13
Resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa
to ciprofloxacin mainly include mutations
in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV
(encoded by the gyrA and parC genes,
respectively).31 It takes time for mutations
to occur and spread within a bacterial
population, which may account for the
delayed drug resistance we observed.
Exposure to ciprofloxacin may also increase
expression of the active efflux pump system
in P. aeruginosa, as a rapid stress response.
Such resistance mechanisms often induce
P. aeruginosa resistance to a variety of
antibacterial agents.13,32 In agreement with
1134 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
this, we found that the intensity of use of
ciprofloxacin was positively correlated with
the resistance rates of bacteria to other
antibiotics such as amikacin, cefoperazone/
sulbactam, imipenem and meropenem.
P. aeruginosa resistance to cefoperazone/
sulbactam has likely increased active efflux
pump system expression and biofilm forma-
tion.33 Consistent with this, the intensity of
use of cefoperazone/sulbactam was also
found to be positively correlated with the
resistance rates of bacteria to amikacin,
imipenem, meropenem and cefoperazone/
sulbactam itself. Extensive use of ciprofloxa-
cin or cefoperazone/sulbactam may thereby
enable transformation of bacteria to MDR
or XDR forms.
It is also worth noting that there are other
sources of antibacterial agents. For example,
antibacterial agents are sometimes added to
foods, such as milk,34­36 and it is conceivable
that the regular consumption of such foods
may contribute to antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, in the face of serious levels of
antibiotic resistance,37­39 it is important to
consider all possible contributory factors.
A few limitations of this study should be
mentioned. First, this retrospective study
only collected data for bacteria and anti-
biotic use from one hospital ward, and did
not record the clinical characteristics and
demographic features of patients, which
might have impacted on bacterial resistance.
Second, bacterial specimens were not sub-
jected to molecular identification and hom-
ology analyses. Third, it was impossible to
distinguish nosocomial from community-
acquired infections, which might lead to
excessive resistance rates. Furthermore, this
was only a retrospective descriptive analysis,
in which no control group was included, no
intervention was applied for antibacterial
agent use, and bacterial resistance variations
were not analysed after intervention. These
limitations should be considered when inter-
preting the data, and further studies are
warranted to clarify these issues.
Based on our findings, we conclude that
anti-bacterial treatment strategies in burn
departments should focus on Gram-negative
bacteria, especially P. aeruginosa and
K. pneumoniae, for which the prevalence
rates are increasing year by year. The use of
ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and cefopera-
zone/sulbactam should be limited to counter
the increase in resistance of P. aeruginosa
to these agents and other common anti-
Gram-negative antibiotics. These findings
also confirmed that it is insufficient to only
monitor bacterial prevalence in burn
wards when selecting appropriate therapy.
Antibiotic use and the corresponding resist-
ance status of bacteria must also be con-
sidered to ensure the rational use of
antibacterial agents and the development
of effective therapeutic strategies.
