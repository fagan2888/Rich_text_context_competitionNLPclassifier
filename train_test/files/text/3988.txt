Introduction
Cancer is one of the noncommunicable diseases having a
high global burden. Cases of cancer are increasing rapidly
these days because of the changes in environment and life-
style. All cancers develop by genetic damage, which is the
result of either internal factors such as spontaneous muta-
tions, hormones, and nutrient metabolism in the body or
external factors such as excessive tobacco oralcohol con-
sumption, exposure to chemicals, and radiations.
Cancer is the second leading disease in developed coun-
tries, accounting for nearly 1 in every 4 deaths. In the United
States, about 1
658
370 new cancer cases are estimated to
have been diagnosed in 2014, and of these patients, 589430
are expected to die of this disease.1 Skin carcinogenesis is
the most prevalent of all cancer types, and its incidence is
expected to rise substantially. There are 2 types of skin can-
cer: malignant melanoma of the skin and nonmelanoma
skin cancer. Malignant melanoma is the most serious type
of skin cancer. Epidemiological data and experimental evi-
dence suggest that UV-B radiation has the potential to cause
both squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma
because of its characteristic wavelength range.1
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the by-products gen-
erated during the respiratory and metabolic reactions in our
body. These species have both positive and negative impacts
on our body depending on their concentrations: at low lev-
els, these molecules have important roles in signal transduc-
tion, whereas higher levels of ROS can cause oxidative
stress and tissue destruction. In cancer cases, the cells gen-
erate reactive molecules rapidly to accelerate their growth,
so these molecules can act as a cancer marker. We need to
discover products that can scavenge these free radicals
without affecting our normal cells.2
Besides the advancement in cancer treatment techniques,
there should be a preventive approach that is effective and
safer. Cancer chemoprevention is a promising strategy,
which is now gaining momentum. Chemopreventive agents
are synthetic and natural products such as phytochemicals,

Chemomodulatory Potential of Flaxseed
Oil Against DMBA/Croton Oil­Induced Skin
Carcinogenesis in Mice
Jyoti Sharma, MSc1, Ritu Singh, MSc1, and P. K. Goyal, PhD1
Abstract
The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential of flaxseed oil to prevent chemically induced skin cancer in
mice. Cancer was induced on 2-stage skin carcinogenesis model by single topical application of 7,12 dimethylbenz [a]
anthracene (DMBA), as, initiator, and two weeks later it was promoted by croton oil treatment thrice a week on the dorsal
surface of mice for 16 weeks. Flaxseed oil (FSO; 100µL/animal/d) was orally administered 1 week before and 1 week after
DMBA application (Peri-initiation stage). The animals of the FSO-administered group showed a significant reduction in
tumor incidence (76.67%), cumulative number of tumors (37), tumor yield (3.7), and tumor burden (4.81) when compared
with the carcinogen-treated control animals. Biochemical parameters in skin and liver tissue such as LPO and phase I
enzymes were significantly (P < .01) reduced in the FSO-treated experimental group, whereas the phase II enzymes (GST,
DT-diaphorase) and antioxidant parameters (GSH, GPx, SOD, catalase, and vitamin C) exhibited a significant (P < .01)
elevation when compared with the animals of the carcinogen-treated control group. Histopathological alterations in the
carcinogen-treated control animals were also observed in the form of epidermal hyperplasia, keratinized pearl formation,
and acanthosis in skin and tumors, whereas these were found to be reduced after FSO administration. The results of
the present study demonstrate that the oral administration of FSO has the potential to modulate the levels of LPO,
antioxidants, and detoxification enzymes in the DMBA-croton oil­induced skin carcinogenesis in mice.

vitamins, and minerals that inhibit, delay, or reverse the
multistep process of carcinogenesis, including initiation,
promotion, and progression of malignant cells. The chemo-
preventive potential of various natural products has been
investigated during the recent past. Our laboratory has also
evaluated the anticancer potential of various medicinal
plants--Phyllanthus niruri, Aegle marmelos, Syzygium
cumini, Aveorrha carambola.3-6
Flaxseed oil (FSO) is obtained from Linum usitatissi-
mum belonging to the family Linaceae. Such oil is con-
sumed in various food formulations, and it is the subject of
extensive research because of its potential health benefits.
The physiological benefits of flax oil are attributed primar-
ily to the high -linoleic acid content, chlorophyll pigments,
-tocopherol, plastochromanol-8, phenolic acids, and flava-
noids, which may play significant and/or synergistic roles
in the pharmacological quality of the oil.7
Basch etal8 reviewed the medicinal properties of flax-
seed and concluded that it had been studied on humans for
the prevention and treatment of 13 diseases, including con-
stipation (as a laxative), attention-deficit hyperactivity dis-
order, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis/coronary artery
disease, menopausal symptoms, cyclic mastalgia (breast
pain), breast cancer, prostate cancer, acquired immune defi-
ciency syndrome (AIDS), and hyperglycemia/diabetes. The
scientific literature also provides evidence of the radiopro-
tective and photoprotective properties of FSO in animal
models.9,10
The present study has been conducted to evaluate the
chemomodulatory potential of FSO during DMBA and cro-
ton oil­induced skin carcinogenesis in mice.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
The initiator, 7, 12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA)
and croton oil (used as promoter) were procured from
Sigma Chemicals Co, St Louis, MO. DMBA was dissolved
in acetone at a concentration of 100 µg/100 µL. Croton oil
was mixed in acetone to give a solution of 1% dilution. FSO
was procured from Prano Flax India Private Ltd.
Animals
Animal care and handling were approved by the ethical com-
mittee of our institution (1678/GO/a/12/CPCSEA), and these
were done according to guidelines set by the World Health
Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, and the Indian National
Science Academy, New Delhi, India. The present study was
conducted on Swiss albino mice (7-8 weeks old weighing 24
± 2 g), selected from a random breed inbred colony. These
animals were housed in polypropylene cages in the animal
house under controlled conditions of temperature (25°C ±
2°C) and light (14 light:10 dark). The animals were fed a
standard mouse feed (procured from Aashirwad Industries,
Chandigarh, India) and water ad libitum.
Experimental Design
Swiss albino mice in the resting phase of growth were
selected from the inbred colony and divided into 5 groups.
The dorsal hair between the cervical and caudal portions
was clipped using a surgical clipper 2 weeks before applica-
tion of the initiator.
Group I (vehicle-treated control; n = 10): animals of this
group were treated with acetone (100 µL/animal) on the
dorsal clipped portion, and double distilled water equiv-
alent to FSO (100 µL/animal/d) was administered orally
throughout the experimental period of 16 weeks.
Group II (FSO-treated control; n = 10): these animals
were administered FSO alone at a dose of 100 µL/
animal/d for the 16 weeks.
Group III (carcinogen-treated control; n = 10): a single
dose of 100 µL DMBA (100 µg/100 µL acetone) was
applied over the dorsal surface of mice in this group.
Two weeks later, croton oil (100 µL as 1% w/v in ace-
tone) was applied topically 3 times a week until the end
of the experimental period.
Group IV (experimental; n = 10): In this peri-initiation
treatment group, animals received FSO (100 µL/
animal/d) from 7 days prior to 7 days after the DMBA
application, whereas the croton oil was applied similarly
to group III.
Animals of all the groups were monitored daily, and their
weight was taken weekly. The mice were observed weekly
for the detection of tumors on the dorsal surface, and tumors
with diameter greater than 2 mm and whose persistence was
more than 2 weeks were recorded. The parameters studied
after the completion (ie, 16 weeks) of the experiment are
discussed below.
Morphological
1. Tumor incidence: the number of mice carrying at
least 1 tumor expressed as percentage incidence.
2. Tumor yield: the average numbers of tumors per
mouse.
3. Tumor burden: the average number of tumors per
tumor-bearing mouse.
4. Cumulative number of tumors: the total number of
tumors carried by all mice.
5. Tumor diameter: the average diameter of tumors.
6. Tumor weight: the average weight of tumors mea-
sured at the end of the experiment.

7. Bodyweight: the average body weight of animals
measured weekly.
8. Average latent period: the lag between the applica-
tion of the promoting agent and the appearance of
50% of tumors was determined. The average latent
period was calculated by multiplying the number of
tumors appearing each week by the time in weeks
after the application of the promoting agent and
dividing the sum by the total number of tumors:

Biochemical
The biochemical parameters measured in liver and skin at the
termination of the experiment (ie, 16 weeks) are given below.
Lipid Peroxidation (LPO).LPO was estimated in liver and
skin spectrophotometrically by the thiobarbituric acid reac-
tive substances method.11
Total Proteins. Proteins were determined in liver and skin by
the method of Lowry etal,12 using bovine serum albumin as
standard at 680 nm.
Phase I Enzymes
Cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b5. Cytochrome P450
was determined using the carbon monoxide difference
spectra. Both cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b5 content
were assayed in the microsomal suspension by the method
of Omura and Sato.13
Phase II Enzymes
Glutathione S-transferase (GST). GST activity was deter-
mined in liver and skin spectrophotometrically at 37°C,
according to the procedure of Habig etal.14
DT diaphorase. DT diaphorase activity was measured in
the liver and skin, as described by Ernest etal.15
Antioxidant Parameters
Reduced glutathione (GSH).Reduced glutathione was
estimated in liver and skin as total non-protein sulphydryl
group by the method as described by Moron etal.16
Glutathione peroxidase (GPx). GPx activity was measured
in liver and skin by the coupled assay method, as described
by Paglia and Valentine.17
Catalase (CAT). CAT was estimated in liver and skin at
240 nm by monitoring the decrease of H

as described
by Aebi.18
Superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD was assayed utilizing
the technique of Marklund and Marklund.19
Vitamin C. Skin and liver of animals were homogenized
in acetate buffer (20 mg/mL), and 4% cold trichloroacetic
acid was used for tissue extraction. The determination of
ascorbic acid activity was done according to the protocol
given by Roe and Kuether.20
Histopathological Analysis
After the 16th week, tumors and skin of sacrificed animals
were removed and fixed in 10% formalin fixative for 24
hours. Dehydration of the tissue was done in ascending series
of alcohol, embedded in paraffin wax, and 4-µm thick sec-
tions were prepared and studied using a light microscope.
Statistical Analysis
All the above parameters were compared among different
groups statistically by using Student's t test.
Results
Morphological
A gradual increase in body weight from the initiation of
treatment was noted in all the groups, and such weight was
found to be near normal at the end of the experimentation.
Vehicle-treated (group I) as well as FSO-treated control ani-
mals (group II) did not show any tumor appearance through-
out the experimentation (Table 1).
The incidence of tumors in DMBA/croton oil­treated
animals was noted as 100%, and the average latent period of
tumor appearance was recorded as 9.92 ± 0.02 weeks. The
oral administration of FSO caused a 23.33% reduction in
tumor incidence, and the cumulative number of tumors
decreased to 37.00 ± 2.4 from 55.33 ± 2.04 in the experi-
mental animals (group IV) when compared with the carcin-
ogen-treated controls (group III). Furthermore, the average
latent period was increased to 11.68 ± 0.13 weeks after FSO
administration (Tables 1 and 2). Tumor yield and tumor
burden in the animals were significantly reduced to 3.7 ±
0.24 and 4.81 ± 0.21, respectively, after treatment with
FSO, and these were 5.53 ± 0.20 and 5.53 ± 0.20 in group
III. Similarly, the inhibition of tumor multiplicity was cal-
culated as 33.13% in the animals in group IV (Table 2;
Figure 1).

carcinogen­treated animal with or without flaxseed oil.
Biochemical
Lipid Peroxidation.Oral administration of FSO in the peri-
initiation treatment group showed 1.17- (P < .01) and 1.42-
fold (P < .01) reduction of the malondialdehyde levels in
the liver and skin of animals when compared with the car-
cinogen-treated control group (Figure 2).
Total Protein. The total protein levels of the animals in group
III were significantly reduced to 1.68- and 1.70-fold (P <
.001) in the liver and skin, respectively, in comparison to
the vehicle-treated control group. In contrast, there was sig-
nificant (P < .01) elevation of total protein levels in the liver
(0.77-fold) and skin (0.74-fold) in animals in group IV after
treatment with FSO when compared with the DMBA/cro-
ton oil­treated group (Figure 3).
Phase I Enzymes.Cytochrome P450 in the carcinogen-
treated control group showed a marked decrease: 0.81-fold
(P < .001) in skin and 0.84-fold (P < .001) in liver as com-
pared with group I. The levels were elevated to near normal
as 1.13- and 1.07-fold (P < .01) in skin and liver, respec-
tively, when FSO was administered (Figure 4).
Similarly, the activity of cytochrome b5 exhibited a sig-
nificant (P < .001) elevation in the liver (1.29-fold) and skin
(1.28-fold) of the carcinogen-treated control group in com-
parison to group I. Oral administration of FSO to the ani-
mals in group IV significantly decreased the levels of
cytochrome b5 in both the tissues: 0.90-fold (P < .01) in
362 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
liver and 0.91-fold (P < .05) in skin when compared with
animals in group III (Figure 5).
Glutathione S-Transferase. In the animals of the carcinogen-
treated control group, the GST level exhibited a significant
reduction of 0.45-fold (P < .001) in liver and 0.50-fold (P <
.001) in skin when compared with the vehicle-treated con-
trol group (Figure 6).
After FSO treatment, a significant (P < .01) decrease in
GST activity was registered in the liver and skin (1.64- and
1.72-fold, respectively) in experimental animals (Figure 6).
DT-Diaphorase.
The activity of enzyme DT-diaphorase
exhibited a significant (P < .001) reduction in liver (0.48-
fold) and skin (0.47-fold) in group III animals when com-
pared with the animals in group I. In contrast, FSO
administration in group IV led to a significant elevation
(P < .05) in DT-diaphorase level: 1.26-fold in the liver and
1.30-fold in the skin of animals in comparison with carcin-
ogen-treated control group (Figure 7).
Reduced Glutathione.DMBA-croton oil treatment caused a
significant (P < .001) reduction in GSH activity: 0.45-fold in
liver and 0.19-fold in skin compared with group I. An incre-
ment in GSH levels of 1.50-fold and 1.55-fold,respectively,
was noted in animals in group IV after FSO treatment in
comparison with animals in group III (Figure 8).
Glutathione Peroxidase.The activities of GPx significantly
(P < .001) declined in skin (0.46-fold) and liver (0.48-fold)
after treatment with carcinogen and promoter in group III as
compared with group I. FSO administration resulted in a

significant (P < .05) increase in GPx activity: 1.38-fold in
liver and 1.47-fold in skin (Figure 9).
Catalase. Relative to the vehicle-treated controls, the activ-
ity of CAT was significantly (P < .001) diminished in both
liver (0.60-fold) and skin (0.52-fold) in animals belonging
to group III. In contrast, the levels of CAT were signifi-
cantly (P < .01) enhanced to 1.27- and 1.33-fold in liver and
skin, respectively, in group IV as compared with the carcin-
ogen-treated control group (Figure 10).
Superoxide Dismutase.When compared with group I, ani-
mals in the carcinogen-treated control group exhibited a
significant (P < .001) inhibition of SOD activity in liver
(0.61-fold) and skin (0.55-fold). Specific activity of this
enzyme was significantly increased by 1.30-fold in the liver
and 1.43-fold in the skin of FSO-treated animals with
respect to group III (Figure 11).
Vitamin C. In contrast to vehicle-treated controls, ascorbate
activity showed a significant decline in liver and skin--
0.61-fold and 0.49-fold, respectively--whereas FSO
administration resulted in a significant increment in vitamin
C levels of 1.22-fold in the liver and 1.37-fold in skin when
compared with group III (Figure 12).
Histopathological Alterations
The animals in the vehicle-treated group showed normal
skin layers--that is, epidermis, dermis, and basal layer
(Figure 13A). Carcinogen and promoter treatment indicated
the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. The slides in

group III animals exhibited thickening of the epidermis
(acanthosis), invasion of epidermal cells in the dermis, and
formation of keratin pearls. The dermal region showed
reduced dermal fibroblasts and fibroconnective tissue in
carcinogen-treated control animals (Figure 13B). Sections
of tumor revealed cells with atypical nuclei, dyskeratosis of
keratin, and lymphocytes with reduced stroma accumulated
at margins (Figure 13C).
Administration of the FSO during the peri-initiation stage
demonstrated a lower degree of epidermal hyperplasia,
acanthosis, and damage in sebaceous glands. A moderate
number of keratinized pearls were observed with suprabasal
hyperplasia in the FSO-treated experimental groups in com-
parison with carcinogen-treated control (Figures 13D-13E).
Discussion
FSO is a rich source of -linolenic acid, which can be con-
verted into long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
(PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexae-
noic acid (DHA) via elongation and desaturation reactions.21
The present study was performed to evaluate the potential
of FSO against DMBA-croton oil­induced skin carcinogenesis.
DMBA is an indirect-acting and organ-specific carcino-
gen, which is metabolized to the ultimate carcinogen
1,2-epoxide-3,4-diol DMBA by CYP1A1 and CYP1B1
enzymes of CYP450. The DMBA intermediate causes muta-
tions in the genome by forming adducts with DNA and acts
as initiator in chemical carcinogenesis.22 12-O-tetradecanoyl
phorbol-13-acetate is the active constituent of croton oil that
binds with protein kinase C and leads to transcription of
early genes c-fos and c-jun, and stimulates the activating
protein-1 and NF-B transcription factors, which result in
cellular proliferation and apoptosis.23
Reduction in the cumulative number of tumors, tumor
yield, tumor burden, and tumor incidence by administering
various plant extracts during chemical-induced carcinogene-
sis has been observed earlier.24,25 Similarly, a considerable
decrease in skin tumors with the oral administration of FSO to
mice has been reported in the present study. It might be pos-
sible that -linolenic acid, flavanoids, phenolic acid, and
tocopherols in FSO elevated the cellular antioxidants and
reduced the oxidative damage caused by carcinogen and
promoter.
LPO is produced during life processes in a chain reaction
initiated by free radicals produced. Malondialdehyde is the
lipid electrophile generated from peroxidation, and an
increase in its levels is an alarming sign of various diseases,
including cancer.26 Topical application of DMBA and croton

oil to animals increases the production of ROS and ultimately
leads to higher LPO levels in skin and liver, as observed in
the present study. In contrast, FSO, rich in PUFA, protects the
cellular membranes, and its other phytochemicals scavenge
free radicals and inhibit LPO in experimental animals.

are the phase I enzymes respon-
sible for the biotransformation of DMBA into its active
intermediate. The elevated levels of phase I enzymes act as
a biomarker for cancer detection, and a related trend was
noted in the carcinogen-treated control group.27 Modulatory

action of FSO reverted back the levels of both enzymes near
to normal in the liver and skin of animals in group IV.
Mounting evidence reveals that phytochemicals enhance
phase II enzyme levels in biological tissues. GSTs and
DT-diaphorase facilitate the detoxification of carcinogens
by conjugating the carcinogen with GSH and uridine
diphosphate glucuronic acid, respectively, for its fast detox-
ification and excretion.28 In the present study, elevated
phase II enzyme levels in skin and liver of experimental
animals were recorded after FSO administration.
Treatment with FSO increased the levels of enzymatic
(SOD, CAT, GPx) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (GSH) in
both skin and liver, which were noted to be decreased in the
carcinogen-treated control group. SOD accelerates the dis-
mutation of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and
finally CAT, and GPx degrades H
2
O
2
into water and oxy-
gen. GPx is a selenium-containing enzyme, which works in
association with GSH and needs different secondary
enzymes (GR and G-6-PDH) and cofactors (NADPH and
glucose-6-PO
4
) for efficient action.28 Carcinogen treatment
reduced the levels of SOD by generating ROS, whereas the
free radical scavenging action of FSO restored the same
toward normal in the experimental animals.
Tripeptide glutathione is a nonprotein thiol that plays a
crucial role in scavenging free radicals. GSH can readily
form adducts with ROS and protects the macromolecules in
our body.29 The depletion in GSH content in the control ani-
mals was associated with tumor genesis, and administration
of FSO reduced the oxidative stress and hence balanced the
GSH levels.
Similarly, levels of vitamin C were observed to be
reduced in carcinogen-treated controls because such vita-
mins are used in quenching free radicals in the aqueous
phase to protect cellular membranes from degradation.29
FSO intake in mice conserves the vitamin C activity toward
the normal range by scavenging the reactive species.
This study was limited to the mouse model. The literature
shows the anticancer properties of FSO against breast, colon,
prostate, and intestinal cancer30 and others, with the possible
mechanism associated with its high -3 PUFA content,
which reduces the formation of proinflammatory mediators
PGE2 and LTB4 from arachidonic acid. Omega-3 fatty acids
of FSO hinder the production of prostaglandins by acting on
the cyclooxygenase pathway.31 Fatty acid metabolism is the
same in all mammalian models, including mice and humans,
although evidence from animal and human experimentation
suggests that the products of omega-3-fatty acid (EPA and
DHA) do have different potentials to alter gene expression
and resulting metabolic and cellular functions.32
Conclusion
The results of the present study suggest that FSO admin-
istration at the peri-initiation stage of carcinogenesis has
chemopreventive potential by modulating the phase I and
phase II enzymes and antioxidants in mammals. The anti-
cancer and antioxidative effect of FSO might be a result
of the synergistic action of various antioxidants present in
such oil.
