Abstract
Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of ondansetron during cesarean section under
spinal anesthesia.
Methods: We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ondansetron during spinal
anesthesia for cesarean section in The Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science
from their inception to September 2016.
Results: Altogether, 21 RCTs were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that the
ondansetron group had a lower incidence of nausea/vomiting and bradycardia than the placebo
group during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia [relative risk (RR) ¼ 0.43, 95% confidence
interval (CI) (0.36, 0.51) and RR ¼ 0.45, 95% CI (0.26, 0.80), respectively]. There were no
significant differences in the incidences of pruritus, hypotension, or shivering during cesarean
section under spinal anesthesia [RR ¼ 0.92, 95% CI (0.83, 1.02); RR ¼ 0.72 (0.50, 1.06), 95% CI
(0.50, 1.06); and RR ¼ 0.89, 95% CI (0.71, 1.11), respectively].
Conclusion: Ondansetron effectively reduces the incidences of nausea/vomiting and bradycardia
under spinal anesthesia during cesarean section.

Introduction
The focus of obstetric anesthesia is to ensure
the safety of mother and child. Therefore,
it is essential to select the anesthesia and its
administration carefully. Spinal anesthesia,
because it is a simple medication that
has little impact on the fetus, has become
a preferred choice for cesarean section.

The Apgar score of the fetus under spinal
anesthesia for cesarean section was higher
than that under general anesthesia.1,2
Although spinal anesthesia is ideal for cesar-
ean section, it also causes adverse reactions.
Spinal anesthesia can lead to severe brady-
cardia or hypotension in puerperae who
display unstable hemodynamics.3 Yeh et al.4
found that, because of the special physio-
logical characteristics of obstetrics, the post-
operative incidence of pruritus may be as
high as 85% in patients who have epidural
analgesia with morphine after cesarean sec-
tion. In addition, according to Teresa and
Cartoon,5 the incidence of shivering during
cesarean section is as high as 57%. Patient-
controlled intravenous analgesia is com-
monly used after cesarean section. As most
analgesic drugs are opioids, however, they
often trigger nausea, vomiting, and other
adverse puerperal reactions after cesarean
section.
Currently, ondansetron is widely used
during cesarean section, and numerous related
high-quality studies have been published. To
date, however, there has been no meta-
analysis of ondansetron used during cesarean
section under spinal anesthesia. We therefore
conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the
efficacy and safety of ondansetron during
cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
Materials and methods
Inclusion criteria
. Study design: randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), regardless of whether
allocation concealment and blinding
were used.
. Study subjects: patients given ondan-
setron during cesarean section under
spinal anesthesia.
. Interventions: (1) ondansetron
administration (experimental group);
(2) administration of a placebo (con-
trol group).
. Outcome measures: Main: incidence
of nausea/vomiting. Secondary: inci-
dence of pruritus, bradycardia, shi-
vering, hypotension.
Exclusion criterion
. Literature had no specific data or full text.
Search strategy
The Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE,
and Web of Science were searched for RCTs
studying ondansetron given under spinal
anesthesia for cesarean section from the
database inception to September 2016.
English search terms included ``randomized
controlled trial,'' ``controlled clinical
trial,'' ``cesarean section,'' ``ondansetron,''
``epidural,'' ``spinal,'' among others. For
example, a specific search strategy in
PubMed is described in Box 1.

Literature screening, data extraction, and quality
evaluation. Two reviewers independently
selected the literature, extracted the data,
and assessed the quality according to the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. When there
was a disagreement, it was resolved by
further discussion. The contents of the data
extraction included the title, author, publi-
cation year, study objects and characteris-
tics, sample size, interventions, outcome
measures and measurement results, quality
evaluation, and other related contents.
Zhou et al. 655
Jadad scores were performed in terms of the
randomization method employed and if
there was allocation concealment. Also con-
sidered were the presence of blinding, with-
drawal, or dropouts.
Statistical analysis
A meta-analysis was performed via using
RevMan 5.2 provided by the Cochrane
Collaboration. Enumeration data were pre-
sented as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio
(OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
Measurement data were expressed as the
mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI. The
heterogeneity among included studies was
tested by the 2 test. If homogeneity was
found (P > 0.10, I2 < 50%), a fixed-effects
model was employed for the meta-analysis.
If P < 0.1 and I2  50%, we further analyzed
the source of heterogeneity. A random-
effects model for the meta-analysis was
used in the absence of significant clinical
heterogeneity, and a subgroup analysis or
descriptive analysis was used in the presence
of significant clinical heterogeneity.

were reported. The meta-analysis results of
the fixed-effects model showed that the
incidence of nausea/vomiting was signifi-
cantly lower in the ondansetron group than
in the placebo group [RR ¼ 0.43, 95% CI
(0.36, 0.51), P < 0.00001] (Figure 4).
Bradycardia. A total of 7 RCTs, with 449
people, were included in the study.
Bradycardia triggered by spinal anesthesia
during cesarean section was reported. The
meta-analysis results of the fixed-effects
model showed that the incidence of brady-
cardia in the ondansetron group was
statistically significantly lower than that in
the placebo group [RR ¼ 0.45, 95% CI
(0.26, 0.80), P ¼ 0.006] (Figure 4(c)).
Discussion
We conducted subgroup analyses on the
21 included studies according to the out-
come indicators of the control group. The
results showed that the ondansetron group
experienced significantly lower incidences of
bradycardia and nausea/vomiting than the
placebo group under spinal anesthesia
during cesarean section. The two groups,

however, differed little in their incidences of
pruritus, hypotension, or shivering.
Ondansetron is a potent, highly select-
ive serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist. It
can prevent the combination of 5-HT
released by activated platelets with 5-HT3
receptors in the vagal nerve endings of the
left ventricle, attenuate Bezold­Jarisch
reflexes produced by left ventricular mech-
anoreceptors stimulated by 5-HT, inhibit
further expansion of peripheral blood ves-
sels, and increase venous return, thereby
reducing the incidence of hypotension.27,28
Owczuk et al.29 observed that intraven-
ously injecting 8 mg ondansetron 5 min
before spinal anesthesia can curb the reduc-
tion of systolic blood pressure without affect-
ing the diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.
Sahoo et al.14 reported that intravenous
injection of 8 mg ondansetron 5 min before
spinal anesthesia can significantly reduce the
incidences of hypotension, nausea, and
vomiting in puerperae undergoing spinal
anesthesia and reduce the use of
vasoconstrictor drugs. Ondansetron is struc-
turally similar to 5-HT3 and has a high
selectivity of dense region in the 5-HT3
receptor. It can block vomiting reflexes
caused by the 5-HT3 receptor-induced vagal
stimulation and inhibit 5-HT release in the
fourth ventricle caused by vagal excitement,
effectively controlling vomiting. Several stu-
dies have demonstrated that ondansetron can
significantly reduce the incidence of post-
operative nausea/vomiting.30
Giving ondansetron to prevent pruritus
and shivering is still debatable. A possible
mechanism for initiating pruritus is opioid
spread via cerebrospinal fluid to the head,
where it acts on the medulla oblongata and
spinal L receptors or 5- HT3 receptors.
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor
antagonist, is commonly used to prevent or
treat nausea/vomiting after surgery and
chemotherapy. Several clinical studies have
confirmed8,31 that it can effectively control
pruritus due to intrathecal injection of mor-
phine. In the present study, ondansetron did

not effectively prevent skin pruritus caused
by intrathecal injection of sufentanil, pos-
sibly because the ondansetron had not yet
reached the location to make the difference.
In addition to medulla oblongata and
5-HT3 receptors, opioids have many other
ways to produce pruritus. Ondansetron can
effectively prevent morphine- or fentanyl-
induced skin pruritus. Yazigi et al.32
believed that ondansetron's antagonism
cannot be used effectively as sufentanil has
higher fat solubility than the former two
drugs, thus acting on the medulla oblongata
and spinal cord more rapidly.
Shivering is a common complication of
anesthesia. Currently, the mechanism of
postoperative shivering is not entirely clear.
It may relate to dysfunctional temperature
regulation, or it may be associated with
the recovery sequence of the nerve center
after anesthesia. One study showed that
5-HT secreted by the hypothalamus plays
an important role in thermoregulation.33 In
animal models, intravenous injection of
5-HT into mice can induce hemangiectasis,
causing shivering,34 suggesting that the
5-HT system plays an important role in
controlling postoperative shivering. Studies
have shown that 5-HT3 antagonists play a
part in preventing postoperative shivering,
and its mechanism may be associated with
inhibition of 5-HT in the preoptic anterior
hypothalamus.35
The adverse reactions of ondansetron
often present as neurological symptoms
(e.g., headache, dizziness) or digestive symp-
toms (e.g., abdominal discomfort, abnor-
mally elevated alanine aminotransferase),
but the overall incidences are relatively low.
There are some limitations of this sys-
tematic review. (1) The included studies
differ in regard to the patient's position,
the anesthesia puncture points, measure-
ment indicators, and use of drugs--each of
which could affect the conclusions of this
study. (2) The heterogeneity of the included
studies is distinct, which may influence the
reliability of the meta-analysis. (3) RCTs
included in some subgroup analyses were
not enough. (4) Some RCTs did not give
enough information to judge the scientific
rationality of the trial, and there was a
possibility of implementation biases and
measurement biases. Meanwhile, as we
only covered the published literature, the
search strategy and publication bias could
also affect the results of this study.
In summary, ondansetron can effectively
reduce the incidences of nausea, vomiting,
and bradycardia during spinal anesthesia for
cesarean section, and its safety is relatively
good. Because of the small sample size of
this study, this conclusion remains to be
confirmed by studies with a larger sample
size and multi-center studies.
