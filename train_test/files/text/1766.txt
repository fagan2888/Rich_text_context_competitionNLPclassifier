RESEARCH on the long-term consequences of adverse
childhood experiences has illustrated the negative im-
pact of childhood abuse and neglect on sleep in early and
middle adulthood (Bader, Schafer, Schenkel, Nissen, &
Schwander, 2007; Koskenvuo, Hublin, Partinen, Paunio, &
Koskenvuo, 2010). Serious family conflicts, parental di-
vorce, constant fear of a family member, and having a men-
tally ill or alcoholic family member were related to poorer
sleep in childhood and midlife (Gregory, Caspi, Moffitt, &
Poulton, 2006; Koskenvuo et al., 2010). Despite the preva-
lence of sleep difficulties among older adults (Ancoli-Israel,
2005), no study has investigated if childhood parental abuse
and neglect contributed to subjective sleep complaints in
late adulthood. The primary goal of the present study was to
examine the longitudinal association between childhood pa-
rental abuse and neglect and subjective sleep complaints
among older adults.
The association between childhood experiences and
sleep may be explained by a cognitive­affective model of
physiological arousal (Luecken, Rodriguez, & Appelhans,
2005). Attachment theory suggests that early parent­child
interaction shapes one's internal working model of the self
and self­other interaction (Cassidy & Shaver, 1999). Abu-
sive or neglectful parent­child relationships may reduce
individuals' confidence about their ability to deal with
stress. One study showed that college students who experi-
enced childhood emotional abuse were more likely to de-
velop cognitive schemas of vulnerability to harm, shame,
and self-sacrifice (Wright, Crawford, & Castillo, 2009).
Maladaptive cognitive appraisal of the environment and hy-
pervigilance to threat cues may ensue. Experimental studies
on college students reporting abuse and poor family rela-
tionships also supported this cognitive­affective explana-
tion. As sleep and hypervigilance are two incompatible
physiological states (Buckley & Schatzberg, 2005), early
parental abuse and neglect may exacerbate future sleep
problems.
Poor childhood attachment may continue to influence
sleep through poor adulthood attachment. Drawing upon
the cumulative disadvantage perspective (Dannefer, 2003),
poor parent­child relationships may foreshadow problems
in future social relationships and compromise sleep. A qual-
itative review of the influence of early family experiences
on well being concluded that hostile and cold family envi-
ronments could hinder the development of emotion regula-
tion skills and increase the likelihood of interpersonal
problems (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002). Whisman
(2006) noted that childhood abuse was associated with
marital disruption and lower marital satisfaction in a large,
nationally representative sample. In two separate studies,
unsupportive social relationships and attachment anxiety
contributed to poorer sleep among married couples and
older women (Carmichael & Reis, 2005; Friedman et al.,
2005). The current study's second aim was to examine
whether current relationship strain accounted for the
association between adverse parent­child relationships in

Objectives. This study examined whether subjective sleep complaints in late adulthood were associated with child-
hood parental abuse and neglect and whether the association was mediated by current relationship strain and emotional
distress.
Methods. Multiple regression analyses were performed on data from 877 older adults aged 60 years and above from
the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Adverse childhood experiences were retrospectively
recalled at Time 1 (1995­1996). Sleep complaints, relationship strain, and emotional distress were assessed at Time 2
(2004­2006).
Results. Early parental emotional abuse was significantly associated with more sleep complaints in old age. Unsup-
portive interactions with family, friends, significant others, and emotional distress partially explained the association.
Discussion. Parental emotional abuse in childhood hindered the development of supportive social relationships later
in life, which was associated with more emotional distress, and exerted a negative influence on subjective sleep quality
among older adults. Future research should examine other underlying mechanisms that explain the contribution of human
attachment to sleep across the lifespan.

childhood and sleep problems in late adulthood and if this
was mediated by emotional distress.
Although previous research has revealed a connection
between childhood abuse and neglect and sleep problems in
young adulthood and midlife, none has examined if this as-
sociation prevails in old age, when sleep complaints are in-
creasingly prevalent. Further, investigators have not
considered the role of current relationship strain. To address
these questions, we hypothesized that childhood parental
physical and emotional abuse and neglect would contribute
to more sleep problems in late life. Second, we hypothe-
sized that current relationship strain would mediate the as-
sociation. Finally, we examined whether this was partially
explained by emotional distress.
Methods
Sample
Participants were selected from the random digit-dialing
sample of the National Survey of Midlife Development in
the United States (MIDUS). A detailed description of the
data set and data collection procedures can be obtained at
the MIDUS Web site (http://midmac.med.harvard.edu/
research.html). The MIDUS included 3,487 noninstitutional-
ized, English-speaking adults living in the United States at
Time 1 (1995­1996). Follow-up data collection took place
about nine years later (2004­2006). The present sample
included 877 older adults aged 60 and above at Time 2. Sam-
ple selection was driven by our research focus on the lasting
influence of early attachment on sleep in late adulthood.
Outcome Variable
Sleep complaints.--At Time 2, four items measured sub-
jective sleep complaints. Participants were asked how often
they "have trouble falling asleep," "wake up during the
night and have difficulty going back to sleep," "wake up
too early in the morning and [are] unable to get back to
sleep," and "feel unrested during the day, no matter how
many hours of sleep [they] had" in the past 30 days. Items
were rated on a 5-point scale: 1 (never), 2 (rarely), 3 (some-
times), 4 (often), and 5 (almost always). The four items
were summed, with higher scores indicating more sleep
difficulties. Internal consistency of this measure was good
(a = .81).
Independent Variables
Parental abuse.--At Time 1, physical abuse was assessed
by asking participants how often their mother and father
"pushed, grabbed, or shoved [them]; slapped [them]; threw
something at [them]"; "kicked, bit, or hit with a fist; hit or
tried to hit [them] with something; beat [them] up; choked;
burned or scalded [them]" during childhood. Emotional
abuse was assessed by asking participants how often their
mother and father "insulted or swore at [them]; sulked or
refused to talk to [them]; stomped out of the room; did or
said something to spite [them]; threatened to hit [them];
smashed or kicked something in anger." Responses were
rated on a 4-point scale (1 = often, 2 = sometimes, 3 = rarely,
4 = never).
We constructed two variables to indicate the frequency
of parental physical and emotional abuse, respectively.
Items were reverse coded. Higher scores would indicate
more frequent occurrence of abuse. For physical abuse,
the highest frequency endorsed for each physical aggres-
sion item for either parent was used to indicate the overall
frequency of physical abuse. For emotional abuse, the
highest frequency endorsed for either parent indicated the
overall frequency of parental emotional abuse. For exam-
ple, if a participant reported emotional abuse "often"
from his or her mother and "never" from his or her father,
the frequency of emotional abuse would be recoded as
"often." Averaging maternal and paternal abuse could
have resulted in an underestimation of the frequency of
abuse.
Parental neglect.--At Time 1, participants recalled the
amount of affection, care, understanding, support, time,
and effort given by their parents during childhood by re-
sponding to 12 items on a 4-point scale from 1 (a lot) to 4
(not at all). Six items were averaged and measured mater-
nal and paternal care, respectively. Reliability estimates of
maternal and paternal care were good (a = .90 and .91).
The two scales were summed to represent an overall level
of paternal care in childhood, with higher scores suggest-
ing parental neglect.
Mediating Variables
Current relationship strain.--At Time 2, negative inter-
actions with family and friends were each measured with
four items. Negative interaction with spouse or partner was
measured with six items. A sample item included: "How
often do members of your family/friends/spouse/partner
make too many demands on you?" Each item was rated on
a 4-point scale from 1 (never) to 4 (often). Responses were
averaged for each scale. Higher scores indicated more rela-
tionship strain. Internal consistency of the three measures
were good (a = .76, .79, and .86). The sum of the three
scales was used to indicate total relationship strain.
Emotional distress.--At Time 2, emotional distress in
the past 30 days was assessed by averaging five items
that were rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (all the time) to
5 (none of the time). Sample items included feeling "ner-
vous," "hopeless," and "restless and fidgety." These
CHILDHOOD AND SLEEP 309
items were reverse coded and averaged, with higher
scores indicating more emotional distress. Internal con-
sistency of the scale was good (a = .89).
Covariates
Demographic variables.--Age (in years), sex (0 = men,
1 = women), race (0 = non-White, 1 = White), educational
attainment (0 = less than high school, 1 = high school and
above), marital status (0 = not married, 1 = married), and
self-rated health (1 = poor to 5 = excellent) were included in
all analyses as covariates.
Parental death or divorce or separation.--Two dichot-
omous variables (0 = no, 1 = yes) indicated whether re-
spondent's parents died or divorced or separated before
age 17.
Data Analysis
Ordinary least-squares regression analyses were per-
formed to examine main effects of parental abuse and ne-
glect on sleep (Model 1) and relationship strain (Model 2)
and the main effect of relationship strain on emotional dis-
tress (Model 3). All independent variables and covariates
were entered at the same time. Mediating effects of relation-
ship strain (Model 4) and emotional distress (Model 5) were
examined by adding these variables to Model 1.
Results
Fifty-two percent of the sample were women, with an
average age of 69.25 years (SD = 6.54) at Time 2. Ninety-
two percent were non-Hispanic White. Eighty-seven per-
cent completed high school or more. Sixty-four percent
were married or cohabitating. Eleven percent experienced
parental death; another 11% experienced parental divorce
or separation. The average score of the sleep measure was
9.82 (SD = 3.63). Table 1 presents the main and mediating
effects of parental abuse and neglect on sleep complaints.
Partially supporting Hypothesis 1, parental emotional
abuse, but not physical abuse or emotional neglect, was sig-
nificantly associated with sleep complaints in late adult-
hood.
Supporting Hypothesis 2, current relationship strain was
associated with parental emotional abuse (b = .22, p < .001;
Model 2) and accounted for 36% of the association between
parental emotional abuse and sleep problems in late adult-
hood (b dropped from .11 to .07; Models 1 and 4). The So-
bel test revealed that the mediating effect was significantly
different from zero (z = 3.72, p = .001). Emotional distress
was associated with relationship strain (b = .31, p < .001;
Model 3), accounting for 57% of the impact of relationship
strain on sleep (b dropped from .21 to .12; Models 4 and 5).
The mediating effect was significantly different from zero
(z = 5.67, p < .001). Entering the independent variables and
covariates into separate models did not result in significant
changes.
Discussion
This study extended previous research on the impact of
childhood family experiences on sleep in young and mid-
dle adulthood (Bader et al., 2007; Koskenvuo et al., 2010)
by demonstrating a significant association between child-
hood parental emotional abuse and poorer sleep quality
among older adults. This study was also the first to take
into account the mediating role of current relationship
strain. Consistent with previous research, it was not early
parental unavailability per se but poor relationships that
heightened stress reactivity (Luecken et al., 2005). This

study highlighted the unique contribution of parental
emotional abuse. Indeed, the attachment theory empha-
sized the emotional bonding between parent and child.
Emotional insecurity in childhood could compromise
emotion regulation skills, thus limiting the development
of supportive social relationships (Repetti et al., 2002).
Overall, our findings lent support to the concept of cumu-
lative disadvantage (Dannefer, 2003), such that negative
early attachment relationships continued to exert an in-
fluence on well being decades later, through an accumu-
lation of negative social experiences across the lifespan.
Several limitations warrant attention when interpreting
these findings. First, childhood adversity may be subject to
recall bias. However, research has shown that recall of
childhood experiences tended to be reliable and accurate
(Hardt & Rudder, 2004; Yancura & Aldwin, 2009). Second,
sleep disturbance was measured by summing four items that
each assessed a different type of sleep problem. To increase
specificity, future studies should employ measures that ex-
amine specific sleep domains with multiple items. Third, we
could not rule out the influence of other variables, namely
chronic medical conditions and trait anxiety. To explain a
greater portion of variance of sleep problems longitudinally,
future research may consider the influence of other psycho-
social mediators, such as the personal meaning of relation-
ship strain. Replication of these findings in a more diverse
sample of older adults will also enhance generalizability.
The overall pattern of results supports a lifespan develop-
mental perspective of risk and protective factors of sleep prob-
lems, specifically the importance of secure attachment across
the lifespan. Given the prevalence of sleep complaints in late
adulthood and the impact of sleep on health (Ancoli-Israel,
2005), it is imperative that researchers and clinicians be mind-
ful of psychosocial factors at different life stages that may
elicit poor sleep in late adulthood. Interventions that can re-
duce current relationship strain may also ameliorate the nega-
tive consequences of early parental emotional abuse on sleep.
