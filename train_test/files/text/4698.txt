Test anxiety is a barrier to optimal educational performance
that has been widely studied for well over 30 years. Test anx-
iety research is indeed steeped in international perspectives,
with a long tradition of building theory and empirical evi-
dence from diverse cultures. Although there are differences
identified in the measurement and impact of test anxiety
across different cultures, those differences are generally
explained by the variations across contexts related to the
educational settings, conditions, or opportunities (e.g.,
Cassady, Mohammed, & Mathieu, 2004). The prevalence of
test anxiety has routinely been estimated to lie somewhere
between 25% and 40% of learners reporting they experience
some degree of test anxiety (Carter, Williams, & Silverman,
2008; Ergene, 2003; McDonald, 2001; Putwain, 2007).
Putwain and Daly (2014) recently clarified this view by
reporting that approximately 15% of learners reported they
were "highly test anxious." Perhaps even more concerning is
the available evidence suggesting differential levels of test
anxiety among certain societal groups. For instance, there is
a clear and consistent pattern of results in test anxiety litera-
ture suggesting that females as well as members of ethnic
minority groups tend to report elevated levels of anxiety
(Carter et al., 2008, Ergene, 2003; Hembree, 1988;
McDonald, 2001). There is also a concern that not only the
percentage of test anxious learners is increasing but also the
severity of the perceived anxiety in those learners is on the
rise in countries where there is a high degree of academic
pressure tied to high-stakes tests (e.g., Casbarro, 2005; Lowe,
Grumbein, & Raad, 2011).
Although the literature has provided several orientations to
explaining test anxiety and the influence of test anxiety on
learners and learner outcomes, there tends to be a general
agreement that it is a multidimensional construct, with a two-
factor representation serving as the most enduring view.
Liebert and Morris (1967) set the field forward with their rep-
resentation of test anxiety as composed of emotionality and
worry, which may also be conceptualized as affective and cog-
nitive test anxieties. The emotionality aspect of test anxiety is
identified through biological and physiological responses to
anxiety (e.g., elevated heart rhythm [HR], headaches, cortisol
production; Deffenbacher, 1980; Hembree, 1988; Mattarella-
Micke, Mateo, Kozak, Foster, & Beilock, 2011). The
cognitive--or worry--component attends to manifestations
including (a) self-deprecating thoughts, (b) distractibility dur-
ing study and test-taking, (c) comparisons with peers, (d)

Validation of the Turkish Version of the
Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale­Revised

Abstract
The current study explored the psychometric properties of the newly designed Turkish version of the Cognitive Test Anxiety
Scale­Revised (CTAR). Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed an unidimensional structure consistent with the
conceptualized nature of cognitive test anxiety and previous examinations of the English version of the CTAR. Examination
of the factor loadings revealed two items that were weakly related to the test anxiety construct and as such were prime
candidates for removal. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to compare model fit for the 25- and 23-item version
of the measure. Results indicated that the 23-item version of the measure provided a better fit to the data which support
the removal of the problematic items in the Turkish version of the CTAR. Additional analyses demonstrated the internal
consistency, test­retest reliability, concurrent validity, and gender equivalence for responses offered on the Turkish version
of the measure. Results of the analysis revealed a 23-item Turkish version of the T-CTAR is a valid and reliable measure of
cognitive test anxiety for use among Turkish students.

perceiving tests as threats to self-esteem and peer status, (e)
avoidance of test preparation and evaluative situations, and (f)
impaired study skills and cognitive processing (e.g., Naveh-
Benjamin, 1991; Sarason, Pierce, & Sarason, 1996; Zeidner,
1998; Zeidner & Matthews, 2005). Recently, there has also
been attention given to a social dimension of test anxiety that
may expand the understanding of the coping strategies learn-
ers use when faced with high-anxiety situations (e.g., Friedman
& Bendas-Jacob, 1997; Lowe et al., 2011).
Several examinations of the multidimensional nature of
test anxiety have converged on the determination that the
cognitive dimension of test anxiety is more directly linked to
performance declines in learners (Cassady, 2010). This is
generally explained through either a skills deficit orientation
(i.e., poor cognitive skills and testing strategies lead to fail-
ures; Covington, 1985; Naveh-Benjamin, 1991) or a cogni-
tive-interference perspective (i.e., attentional resources
directed toward nontask activities; Sarason, 1988). Both per-
spectives have merit, and likely explain the experience of a
diverse array of test anxious learners; that is, there are mul-
tiple manifestations of the commonly reported construct of
test anxiety (Zeidner & Matthews, 2005). In both of these
orientations, it is important to recognize that the impact of
test anxiety on the learner and her or his outcomes is not
restricted to the testing situation itself. Rather, across all
phases of the "Learning-Testing Cycle," test anxiety can
have an impact that will decrease overall performance. As
such, test anxiety affects the learners' experience during test
preparation, test performance, and test reflection (Rafferty,
Smith, & Ptacek, 1997; Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1992).
Assessment of Cognitive Test Anxiety
The Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale (CTAR; Cassady &
Johnson, 2002) was developed to assess only the cognitive
aspects of test anxiety, across the learning­testing cycle. The
scale has been used in the United States (e.g., Bourne, Arend,
Johnson, Daher, & Martin, 2006; Cassady, 2004a, 2004b;
Ramirez & Beilock, 2011), Great Britain (Kapetanaki, 2010),
and Greece (Tsianos, Lekkas, Germanakos, Mourlas, &
Samaras, 2009); it has also been effectively translated for use
in China (Chen, 2007; Zheng, 2010), Kuwait (Cassady et al.,
2004), Iran (Baghaei & Cassady, 2014), and Argentina
(Furlan, Cassady, & Perez, 2009). Sparked in large part by
these cross-cultural validation studies, the CTAR has been
revised to eliminate reverse-coded items that were deter-
mined to measure a separate construct (i.e., "test confi-
dence"; Cassady & Finch, 2014). The current Cognitive Test
Anxiety Scale­Revised (CTAR) is a 25-item measure that is
composed largely of the original items from the CTAR.
Test Anxiety in Turkey
Effective research on test anxiety in new cultural settings can
only be realized in the socio-cultural framework of the
educational setting within which students experience academic
stressors. Similar to other European countries, secondary edu-
cation students in Turkey face high levels of stress related to
testing due to several layers of highly competitive educational
assessments used to determine access to University programs
(Dereli, 2003; Kutlu, 2001). Specifically, higher education
admissions in Turkey are dependent on (a) student performance
in secondary education, (b) determined quality of the second-
ary school the student attended, and (c) a two-stage national-
level central exam (Gür & Çelik, 2009). In this system,
likelihood of admission in post-secondary programs has been
traditionally highly dependent on the quality--or reputation--
of the high school they attended (Gür & Çelik, 2009). The cre-
ation of central exams was intended in part to mitigate potential
inequality in admissions deliberations (cbay, 2005). However,
there continues to be concern that mismatches between high
school educational curriculum and the central assessments con-
tributes to considerable difficulties and uneasiness for students
(Gür & Çelik, 2009).
Available data suggest Turkish universities are highly
selective with admissions. A recent examination conducted
by the OSYM Student Selection and Placement Center
(2014) revealed that more than 2 million students applied for
post-secondary study in Turkish universities--including
both undergraduate and graduate levels. Of these students,
approximately 600,000 were accepted for admittance into
graduate-level programs with an even smaller amount being
accepted--approximately 400,000--for undergraduate
study. This competitive climate for attaining access to qual-
ity higher education naturally sparks concerns for high
school students in Turkey (cbay, 2005; Kutlu 2001). In fact,
the rates of reported test anxiety reported by students prepar-
ing to take the Turkish national exams were higher than gen-
eral reported levels (Aydin & Yerin, 1994; Pinar-Bapinar,
Dereboy, & Eskin, 2012). One study found that 47% of stu-
dents preparing for the Turkish national exam reporting hav-
ing test anxiety (Dereli, 2003), and another line of work
claimed that 84.1% reported either moderate or high levels
of test anxiety (Gençdoan, 2006).
Current Investigation
The CTAR is not unique in having an international
presence--several measures have been adapted for use in
various cultures and languages (e.g., Friedman & Bendas-
Jacob, 1997; Sarason, 1984; Spielberger, 1980)--including
Turkish versions. However, the CTAR has some specific
appeal for use in research as it is widely validated, specifi-
cally targeted on the cognitive domain, as well as free and
easily accessed. The current study is the first known explora-
tion of a Turkish version of the CTAR, with the additional
focus on examining the relationship of the measure to the
previously validated Turkish version of the Test Anxiety
Inventory (TAI; Öner & Kaymak, 1987; Spielberger, 1980)
and specific exploration of cognitive test anxiety in a high
Bozkurt et al. 3
school population at the precipice of the high-stakes testing
event that determines successful matriculation into higher
education programs. We believe these multinational investi-
gations are essential to expand the growing understanding of
academic anxieties in a myriad of cultural contexts--with
particular attention to unique experiences for traditional
underrepresented or underserved groups.
Method
Participants
Data were collected from high school seniors (N = 1075,
55% female) attending secondary schools located in Izmir
between November 2014 and March 2015. The city of Izmir
is located in the west, and it is one of three metropolises in
Turkey. There are numerous educational institutions in this
region which include both upper and lower levels of aca-
demic success. Researchers obtained written permissions
from participants and an ethics committee approval from
Izmir Directorate of Education. Mean age for the sample was
17.31 years (SD = 0.55).
Measures
Text Anxiety Inventory (TAI). The TAI (Spielberger, 1980) is a
20-item measure designed to assess the multidimensional
nature of test anxiety. Participants indicated their typical
reactions to evaluative situations using a 4-point Likert-type
scale (1 = never, 4 = always). TAI items can be used to create
two subscales assessing the Worry and Emotionality dimen-
sions of test anxiety--as well as an indicator of overall levels
of test anxiety. Previous examinations have demonstrated
that the TAI possesses acceptable levels of internal consis-
tency (Worry,  = .93; Emotionality  = .94) and is a valid
indicator of test anxiety among members of the Turkish pop-
ulations (Öner, 1990; Öner & Kaymak, 1987).
CTAR. The CTAR (Cassady & Finch, 2015) is a 25-item revi-
sion of the original CTAR (Cassady & Johnson, 2002) that is
designed to assess the cognitive indicators of test anxiety.
Participants reported how well each of the presented items
describes them using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = not at
all like me, 4 = very much like me). Previous work with the
CTAR has demonstrated that the measure is a reliable and
valid measure of the cognitive test anxiety construct (Cas-
sady & Finch, 2015).
Procedure
Translation of CTAR.Three fluent English­Turkish bilinguals
were recruited to translate the CTAR from English into Turk-
ish for use in the current examination. To maximize the valid-
ity of the cultural adaptation of the measure, translators were
instructed to emphasize transliteral equivalence between the
English and Turkish versions of the CTAR. As result, certain
phrases were modified to reflect the educational structure of
Turkish society. For example, in the Turkish educational sys-
tem, the phrase "final exam" is only used within the context of
post-secondary education. Therefore, the wording on Item 11
of the CTAR was translated from "I tend to freeze up on things
like intelligence tests and final exams" to "I tend to freeze up
on important exams" to ensure the statements evoked similar
meaning among high school and university students.
First, we administered the Turkish version of the CTAR to
a small group of students similar to the population of interest
(n = 10) to ensure that typical high school learners were able
to effectively respond to the newly translated items as ini-
tially prescribed. They reported some words in scale (e.g.,
"final exam") were not appropriate for common use in their
high school settings. Next, we shared those students'
responses and the Turkish version of the CTAR with a panel
of six independent experts who rated (a) the validity of lan-
guage used with the Turkish translation and (b) the overall
meaning of items included in the Turkish version. This pro-
cess was undertaken to ensure that the translation focus on
transliteral equivalence was reached--which ensures that the
newly translated version will focus on the same construct
rather than merely mimic the words in the original survey
(Hocevar & El-Zahhar, 1992). Based on these two initial
validation checks of the language, minor changes were made
to the measure. At that point, the Turkish version of the
Cognitive Test Anxiety Scale­Revised (T-CTAR) was back-
translated from Turkish back into English by a linguist who
subsequently compared the semantic equivalence of the
English and Turkish versions of the scale.
Primary data collection. All participants were volunteers who
provided informed consent prior to taking part in the study.
Participants in the current examination completed a struc-
tured questionnaire form containing a general information
questionnaire (i.e., demographic questionnaire), the Turkish
version of the TAI (Öner & Kaymak, 1987), and the Turkish
version of the CTAR (Cassady & Finch, 2015). The partici-
pants completed each measure in classrooms located on their
respective high school campuses. The experimental proce-
dure took approximately 10 min to complete, and each par-
ticipant completed the experimental materials individually.

Descriptive Statistics

Structural Validity of T-CTAR
To explore the structural validity of the T-CTAR, we ran-
domly split the full 1,075-participant sample into two
4 SAGE Open
random halves. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was
conducted on Sample 1 (n = 536) using Principle Axis
Factoring with the Promax rotation. The EFA was conducted
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS;
Version 21). The scree plot, Kaiser's greater than one crite-
rion (Kaiser, 1970), and parallel analysis (Horn, 1965) were
used to determine the number of factors to be retained.
Kaiser's greater than one criterion and parallel analysis sug-
gested that a four-factor solution was optimal. However,
examination of the scree plot revealed a single dominant fac-
tor accounting for a large amount of the total variance. We
decided on a single-factor solution as it was interpretable,
supported by previous research exploring the dimensionality
of the CTAR (Cassady & Finch, 2015), and accounted for
38.8% of the total variance (see Table 2 for factor loadings).
Two items were dropped (Items 22 and 24) from the factor
solution because their factor loadings fell below the com-
monly used criterion value of 0.30 (Tabachnick & Fidell,
2013). This decision is further supported by prior findings
with the English version of the CTAR that identified ques-
tionable fit for Item 24 (Cassady & Finch, 2015).
Next, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using the
diagonally weighted least squares estimation method was
conducted on Sample 2 (n = 539) to explore the validity of
the single-factor solution identified in the EFA described
above. CFA analyses were performed in R 3.3.1 (R Core
Team, 2016) using the Lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012).
Results of the CFA suggested that the single-factor, 23-item
solution provided an excellent fit to the data, comparative fit
index (CFI) = 0.988, Tucker­Lewis index (TLI) = 0.987,
root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) = 0.041,
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.053. We
next compared the fit of the 25-item soluction proposed in
prior work to the 23-item solution. Results demonstrated the
23-item solution had superior fit to the data, CFI = 0.984,
TLI = 0.982, RMSEA = 0.044, SRMR = 0.056. However,
results of both factor solutions demonstrate the Turkish
CTAR provides a durable unidimensional solution to the
construct of cognitive test anxiety that is consistent with the
initial conceptualization measured by the original English
version (Cassady & Johnson, 2002). Although both factor
solutions demonstrate sufficient model fit, review of the item
statistics as well as consideration of the meaning of the items
within the cultural context of Turkey led to the decision that
the most appropriate version for use in research in the Turkish
version is the 23-item version (see Table 2).
Reliability of T- CTAR
An additional group of high school students (n = 30, 50%
female) from the Izmir region were recruited to explore the
reliability of the T- CTAR. The composition of the subsam-
ple was found to be consistent with that of the sample uti-
lized during primary data collection. Mean age for the
subsample was 17.5 years (SD = 0.51).
Pearson product­moment correlation coefficient revealed
a strong positive correlation between Time 1 and Time 2
scores, r = .93, p < .001, suggesting the T-CTAR provides
stable estimates of cognitive test anxiety across time. The
internal consistency of the 23-item T-CTAR was found to
align with prior studies, illustrating an excellent level of
internal consistency (Cronbach's  = .93). These results are
consistent with prior research demonstrating the stability of
scores on cognitive test anxiety in a sample collected in the
United States (Cassady et al., 2004). Correlational analyses
were conducted using the SPSS software (Version 21).
Concurrent Validity: TAI
To explore the concurrent validity of the Turkish CTAR, we
computed Pearson product­moment correlation coefficients
by assessing the relationship between the Turkish CTAR and
the well-established TAI (Spielberger, 1980). Correlation
analyses were once again conducted using the SPSS soft-
ware (Version 21). Prior studies with various measures of
test anxiety have repeatedly demonstrated that the theoreti-
cally separate dimensions of test anxiety tend to share mod-
erate to high positive correlations (Kalechstein, Hocevar,
Zimmer, & Kalechstein, 1989; Sarason, 1984). As such, we
anticipated the Turkish CTAR would be positively related to
the two subscales as well as the total score for the TAI.
However, given the conceptual alignment between cognitive
test anxiety and worry, we anticipated these two scores
would share the highest correlation.
Results of the analysis revealed strong positive correla-
tions among the test anxiety measures used in this study (see
Table 3). The correlations among the T-CTAR and the Worry
and Emotionality subscales of the TAI were similar, with a
slightly higher correlation observed between T-CTAR and
Worry. This is in line with the theoretical intent of the
T-CTAR, providing good indication of concurrent validity
for the new T-CTAR. The positive relationship with the
Emotionality scale is not surprising--that is, cognitive test
anxiety is not separate from the emotionality construct. Prior
studies with the original CTAR have routinely demonstrated
similar correlations with Sarason's (1984) Bodily Symptoms

subscale from the Reactions to Tests measure, which is a
similar measurement device for emotionality (Cassady,
2004a, 2004b). Furthermore, observation of the relationships
between the two subscales of the TAI for this sample illus-
trate an exceedingly high correlation, limiting the potential
to detect evidence of divergent validity in the relationships
among CTA and the separate TAI subscales. The higher
value observed for the relationship with TAI­Total can be
fully explained by (a) the overlap of the subscales and the
total scale score and (b) simple expectations offered by the
Spearman­Brown prophesy formula for reliable measure-
ment (Nunally & Bernstein, 1994).
Differential Item Functioning (DIF) Analysis for
Gender
Prior investigations exploring the prevalence of cognitive
test anxiety have provided evidence noting that females often
report experiencing higher levels of cognitive test anxiety
than their male counterparts during evaluative events (Carter
et al., 2008; Ergene, 2003; Hembree, 1988; McDonald, 2001;
Putwain, 2007). Therefore, it was decided to examine gender
equivalence for responses offered to items on the T-CTAR
using DIF techniques. We believe continued attention to
these effects with more specific analyses such as DIF can

help illuminate if the noted differences are driven by specific
features, manifestations, or aspects of test anxiety to better
capture the population differences in perceived and experi-
enced test anxieties.
DIF is considered to be present in a measure when respon-
dents from distinctive groups differ in their probability of
endorsing certain responses after controlling for the underly-
ing trait being assessed (Choi, Gibbons, & Crane, 2011;
Clauser & Mazor, 1998). In the current examination, DIF
was assessed using an hybrid, iterative, ordinal logistic
regression method that utilizes techniques common to item
response theory to identify--and control for--levels of the
latent trait under examination (Choi et al., 2011). The use of
an iterative, hybrid ordinal logistic regression method pro-
vides several advantages in the current examination as it
allowed for an examination of uniform, nonuniform, and
total DIF effects for each of the T-CTAR Items. DIF analyses
were performed in R 3.3.1 (R Core Team, 2016) using the
lordif package (Choi et al., 2011).
Results of the DIF analysis revealed 10 items that were
functioning differentially between males and females after
controlling for overall levels of cognitive text anxiety.
Because DIF screening using ordinal logistic regression
techniques is based on the likelihood ratio statistic, some
have expressed concern that given a large enough sample
size the test will produce statistically significant, albeit
meaningless, differences in item functioning (Choi et al.,
2011). Therefore, the magnitude of the DIF effects in the cur-
rent analysis were examined using the criteria set forth
Zumbo (1999) where pseudo R2 values exceeding .13 sig-
naled meaningful differences in item functioning.
Examination of the pseudo R2 values for each items exhibit-
ing DIF revealed no pseudo R2 values exceeded .01 for tests
exploring uniform, nonuniform, and total DIF effects. These
findings suggest that although statistical differences in item
functioning were detected between the genders, items on the
T-CTAR were functioning equivalently for males and
females in the current sample. Items identified as possessing
DIF and pseudo R2 values for the tests of uniform, nonuni-
form, and total DIF are presented in Table 4.
Gender Differences in the Experience of Test
Anxiety
To compare gender difference in the perception and experi-
ence of cognitive test anxiety, an independent samples t test
was conducted comparing levels of test anxiety reported by
males and females on the T-CTAR. Results of the analysis
revealed females reported significantly higher levels of cog-
nitive test anxiety (M = 53.75, SD = 15.03) than males (M =
49.18, SD = 14.74) on the T-CTAR, t(1072) = 4.99, p < .001,
d = 0.30. These results support previous findings suggesting
that females often report higher levels of test anxiety than
their male counterparts (Cassady, 2010; Ergene, 2003;
Hembree, 1988) and, when considered in conjunction with
the previously described DIF analysis, suggest the observed
gender differences cannot be attributed to the differential
functioning of items contained in the T-CTAR.
Discussion
The primary focus of this study was to test the viability of a
newly designed T-CTAR in measuring levels of cognitive
test anxiety in a sample of high school students in the final
year of secondary education. In addition, the study was
designed to examine the relationships among the T-CTAR
and the well-established Turkish version of the TAI.
Translation efforts resulted in a measure that students and
experts alike agreed provided a valid treatment of the test
anxiety construct for use in educational and research con-
texts. Furthermore, investigation of the factorial structure for
the T-CTAR demonstrated that while the 25-item single-fac-
tor solution is viable, a 23-item solution was superior. For
both versions, the results confirmed a line of research illus-
trating that the core items in the T-CTAR and CTAR can rep-
resent a central construct of cognitive test anxiety that is
Bozkurt et al. 7
most readily conceived as a single dimension when examin-
ing the general population (Cassady & Finch, 2015).
The analyses also provided compelling evidence that two
items from the English version of the CTAR should be
removed (Items 22 and 24). Item 24 was also identified as
problematic for achieving optimal fit in prior work with the
English version (Cassady & Finch, 2015) and addresses the
notion that "luck" plays a role in successful test performance.
The repeated failure of this item to fit well within the cogni-
tive test anxiety construct suggests it is not a good item for
future use. This particular item raises another issue of cul-
tural context that bears attention in studies of test anxiety in
a multicultural framework. The concept of "luck" was raised
in prior studies with diverse populations who viewed any
issues of chance or luck to be determined in a religious or
spiritual context. Within different religious and cultural
frameworks, the concept of luck may very well carry differ-
ent meaning and further supporting removal. Item 22
addresses focuses on recognizing mistakes after completing
tests--which may be peripherally related to test anxiety but
not a direct component characteristic. Although the item has
performed reasonably in prior versions, it was clearly not a
useful item in the T-CTAR.
Further analyses demonstrated that the gender differ-
ences observed in total cognitive test anxiety (including in
this study) were not a measurement artifact deriving from
inappropriate DIF for specific items on the T-CTAR. As
such, the data illustrate that males and females respond in a
functionally similar way for the collection of 23 items on
the T-CTAR. Consequently, gender differences noted in
overall T-CTAR scores can be presumed to illustrate a gen-
erally higher level of cognitive test anxiety for high school
females in Turkey than their male counterparts. This pattern
is consistent with a long history of research in test anxiety
and other measures of negative affective responses (e.g.,
Hembree, 1988; Kapikiran, 2002; Putwain & Daly, 2014),
but the advantage of the data in this study is that the spe-
cific focus on item-level differences among males and
females has been ruled out as a source of meaningful expla-
nation for gender differences.
The study also supported that the T-CTAR was a valid and
reliable measure of test anxiety, as demonstrated in the high
internal consistency and theoretically consistent pattern of
convergent validity observed when assessed alongside the
Turkish version of Spielberger's (1980) TAI. The data did
not follow primarily expected patterns because the correla-
tions between T-CTAR and the subscales of the TAI did not
diverge as anticipated. However, this was revealed to be
more of an issue with the extremely high correlation between
the subscales in the TAI, precluding effectively identifying
divergent validity with the current measures.
