Purpose of the study: Little is known about the
effects of chronic illness on social role participation
among racially and ethnically diverse older adults.
This study was undertaken to better understand dis-
ruptions in role among African American, black
Caribbean, white, Latino, and Asian older adults
with arthritis, heart disease, or diabetes. Design
and methods: This study consisted of a cross-
sectional secondary data analysis of the Collaborative
Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. Role disruption
was operationalized using time out of role and role
impairment in the past 30 days. Data from participants
aged 65 and older were used in negative binomial
regression analyses. Results: Overall, prevalence
of role impairment occurred more often than time out
of role. Race and ethnicity were not associated with
time out of role, but they were for role impairment.
Whites experienced more role impairment than any
other racial or ethnic group. Within-group analyses
identified that chronic illness, role participation, and
socioeconomic factors are related in different ways
depending on race or ethnicity. It appears that for
some racially and ethnically diverse older adults,
higher income and education are protective against
role disruption. Implications: Race and ethnicity
are factors in how the social roles of older adults are
affected by chronic illness, and it appears that role dis-
ruption varies with type of illness. Interventions to sup-
port older adults with chronic illness should take into
account the cultural factors related to role disruption.
Key Words:Chronic illness, Diversity and ethnicity,
Social roles and social factors
According to the Centers for Disease Control,
the prevalence of chronic illness across Americans
of all ages is one in two (CDC, 2009). The risk of
chronic illness increases with age, and the public
health implications of chronic illness in the aged
adults are substantial. Eighty percent of older
adults have one chronic illness, whereas 50%
have two or more (National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2011).
Cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and diabetes are
among the most common chronic illnesses in older
adults (Administration on Aging, 2007).
Race and ethnicity factor into the prevalence
of chronic illness among the aging U.S. popula-
tion. For example, older African Americans have
higher rates of chronic illness than other ethnic
groups, whereas older Asian Americans tend to
have lower rates. Older Latinos have higher rates
of diabetes than whites and Asian Americans
and comparable rates of other chronic illnesses
(Banerjee, Perry, Tran, & Arafat, 2010; Gallant,
Spitze, & Grove, 2010).
Chronic illness is often accompanied by
functional limitations and disability, constricting
an older adult's physical being, productive activity,
and social interaction (Druss et al., 2009; Hummel,

2008; Wang, Van Belle, Kukull, & Larson, 2002).
Prior research has found that among minorities,
particularly African Americans, chronic conditions
more negatively affect functioning compared to
whites (Allen et al.,2010; Banerjee et al.,2010; Chiu
& Wray, 2011; Song et al., 2007). These studies,
however, focus mainly on physical functioning;
in order to understand the full impact of chronic
illness, it is necessary to look beyond changes in
physical functioning. Chronic illness intrudes on
multiple levels, such as the social, psychological,
and spiritual (Devins, 1994, 2010), all of which can
diminish quality of life in aging. However, there
is little known about how racially and ethnically
diverse older adults are affected on these other
levels.Oneoftheselevels,socialroles,isofparticular
interest as we learn more about how important
social roles, such as volunteering or caregiving, can
be for positive aging (Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell,
& Rozario, 2007; Jung, Gruenewald, Seeman, &
Sarkisian, 2010; Morrow-Howell, Hinterlong,
Rozario, & Tang, 2003; Piliavin & Siegl, 2007;
Rozario, Morrow-Howell, & Hinterlong, 2004).
Social Roles in Aging
In the aging literature, social roles that are typi-
cal include worker (paid and unpaid), spouse/part-
ner, volunteer, student, parent, grandparent, and
caregiver (Adelmann, 1994; Evandrou & Glaser,
2004; Phillips & Reed, 2009). Social roles provide
a basis for "identifying and placing persons in a
group, organization, or society" (Turner, 1990,
p. 87) and as such encompass duties, rights, and
expected behavior. Role theory discusses concepts
related to "patterned and characteristic social
behaviors, parts or identities that are assumed by
social participants, and scripts or expectations for
behavior that are understood by all and adhered
to by performers" (Biddle, 1986, p. 68). Changes
in role are often destabilizing, especially if they are
accompanied by a loss of autonomy, loss of sup-
port, or are associated with a culturally devalued
status (Turner, 1990), such as in chronic illness.
A devalued role can affect rehabilitation, recov-
ery, and adherence, contributing to further disabil-
ity (Vanhook, 2009). With role functioning a key
aspect of social well-being (Anatchkova, Ware, &
Bjorner, 2011), it is instructive to understand how
roles interact with chronic illness.
Gignac and coworkers (2008) examined the
impact of osteoarthritis on social role function-
ing and found that as age and illness intrusiveness
increased, people felt their role was diminished
and their satisfaction with their role decreased.
Furthermore, a study of adult arthritis sufferers
who had roles such as worker, parent, spouse, or
homemaker found that as their illness increasingly
intruded on their social roles, psychological well-
being decreased (Abraído-Lanza & Revenson,
2006). Some research suggests that a decline in
role participation and functioning contributes
to depressive symptomatology for women and
complicates the healing process (Stenius, Veysey,
Hamilton, & Andersen, 2005). Others have
found that well-being in older adults with multi-
ple chronic conditions was related positively with
satisfaction with role participation (Anaby et al.,
2011). With few exceptions (Adelmann, 1994),
one factor that is often overlooked or unexamined
in previous studies was the race and ethnicity of
the research participants. As the population ages
and becomes increasingly diverse, it is essential to
understand how social roles and participation in
social roles vary for racially and ethnically diverse
older adults.
Double Jeopardy
Variability in outcomes for older ethnic
minorities may be explained by the double
jeopardy hypothesis, which states that older ethnic
minority adults are negatively affected by racism
and ethnic discrimination as well as ageism (Dowd
& Bengtson, 1978). The additive effects of these
two social processes have been conceptualized
as a double burden borne by non-White older
adults (Markides, 1983). Although unexplored
empirically, this burden could differentially affect
how older ethnic minorities are affected by their
chronic illnesses and their abilities to participate
in important social roles. Double jeopardy is one
of a group of potential explanatory models such
as cumulative disadvantage, persistent inequality,
and leveling that aim to help us understand
differences in aging among racially and ethnically
diverse older adults; each has had mixed empirical
support (Brown, O'Rand, & Adkins, 2012;
Ferraro & Farmer, 1996). Comparisons of the
different theoretical orientations across studies
of race, age, and health are challenging due to
methodological differences (Brown et al., 2012).
Furthermore, comparisons other than black/
white have only recently been conducted (Bellizzi
et al., 2012; Brown et al., 2012; Carreon &
Noymer, 2011).
662 The Gerontologist
It is increasingly clear that social roles and social
processes such as those discussed in the double
jeopardy hypothesis need to be examined across
a broader spectrum of racial and ethnic groups.
Factors that may be associated with the extent to
which chronic illness influences role participation
may also vary across groups in a variety of ways
not previously captured through black/white com-
parisons. For example, black Americans are often
treated as one homogenous group although blacks
of Caribbean descent and African Americans differ
in terms of ethnicity, national heritage, socioeco-
nomics, and immigration status (Logan & Deane,
2003). The racial and ethnic heterogeneity in the
older adult population may be associated with
social role functioning in a variety of ways not yet
examined. This study was undertaken to better
understand disruptions in role among racially and
ethnically diverse older adults with chronic illness.
We expect, based on the double jeopardy hypoth-
esis, that non-White older adults will experience
more role disruption associated with chronic ill-
ness. In addition, we expect variability in this rela-
tionship across the five racial and ethnic groups
included here. Understanding how the interference
caused by chronic illness affects different racial
and ethnic groups has important implications for
future care planning and needs for formal and
informal services. This project was guided by the
following hypotheses: (a) There will be differences
in time out of role and role functioning by racial
and ethnic groups, (b) compared with white older
adults, time out of role and role impairment will
be higher for non-White older adults, and (c) dif-
ferences in time out of role and role functioning
by race and ethnicity will be maintained when we
control for age, income, and education.
Design and Methods
Sample
This cross-sectional study utilized secondary
data analysis to examine our three hypotheses.
Data came from the Collaborative Psychiatric
Epidemiology Surveys (CPES). The CPES was
funded primarily by the National Institute of
Mental Health and consists of three interre-
lated surveys--the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication (NCS-R), the National Survey of
American Life (NSAL), and the National Latino
and Asian American Survey (NLAAS). Data for
each survey were collected by the Survey Research
Center at the University of Michigan, were in
the field at the same time (from 2001 to 2003),
and share the multistage area probability sam-
ple designs common to the national surveys con-
ducted by the Survey Research Center (Heeringa
et al., 2004; Pennell et al., 2004). In addition, the
CPES studies were designed to allow integration
of design-based analysis weights to combine data
sets as though they were a single, nationally repre-
sentative study (Heeringa & Berglund, 2007).
Each survey has unique features in its national
area probability samples that complement one
another and allow for racial/ethnic group compari-
sons, which are the focus of this study. The NCS-R,
for example, was designed to be representative of
the U.S. population in general and includes face-
to-face interviews with 9,282 residents of English-
speaking households who were 18 years or older.
The response rate for the NCS-R is 70.9%. The
NSAL was designed to be representative of blacks
in the United States and was based on a national
household probability sample of 6,082 African
Americans, whites, and blacks of Caribbean
descent. The overall response rate for the NSAL
is 72.3%. The NLAAS is a nationally representa-
tive sample of Latino and Asian populations in the
United States and includes 2,554 Latinos and 2,095
Asian Americans with an overall response rate of
73.2% (for more details on the NCS-R, NSAL,
and NLAAS sample designs, see Heeringa, Torres,
Sweetman, & Baser [2006]). This study uses data
from CPES respondents aged 65 and older. As this
study involved secondary data only, IRB approval
was not sought.
Measures
The dependent variables are time out of role
and role impairment due to problems with physical
health, mental health, or use of alcohol or drugs.
Time out of role is the number of days in the past
30 in which the respondent was totally unable to
work or carry out his/her normal activities. Role
impairment is the number of days in the past 30
in which the respondent was able to work and
carry out normal activities but had to cut down
on what he/she did or did not get as much done as
usual, cut back on the quality of his/or her work
or how carefully he/she worked, or had to make
an extreme effort to perform his/her work or other
normal daily activities at the usual level.
The main predictors of interest are the presence
of heart disease, arthritis, or diabetes measured by
Vol. 54, No. 4, 2014 663
dichotomous variables labeled 1 if the respondent
reported that a professional had ever told them they
had the illness, the number of illnesses they report
(none, one, two, or more), and race/ethnicity (non-
Latino white, African American, black Caribbean,
Latino, Asian). Control variables include age (65­
74,74­84,85 and older),gender,household income
(less than $10,511, $10,512­$19,999, $20,000­
$37,999, $38,000 and higher), and education (less
than 11 years, 12 years, 13­15 years, 16 years or
more).
Analysis
Negative binomial regression analyses were
used to examine variables associated with time
out of role and role impairment both between and
within racial/ethnic groups. Negative binomial
regression is an alternative to OLS regression for
skewed count data. In this case, the number of
days of role disruption is positively skewed with
the majority of respondents reporting no days out
of role or with role impairment. For each variable
with more than two categories, a design-corrected
Wald chi-square test was conducted to minimize
the likelihood of Type I error due to multiple com-
parisons. An alpha of .05 was used as the cutoff
for significance. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using the survey commands in Stata 12.0,
accounting for the complex multistage-clustered
design of the CPES samples, unequal probabilities
of selection, nonresponse, and poststratification to
calculate weighted, nationally representative pop-
ulation estimates and standard errors.
Results
Sample Description
Table 1 offers a description of the study
sample. The majority of respondents reported
no chronic illness, whereas 27.9% had one of
the three illnesses and 13.8% had two or more.
Of those with a chronic illness, most reported
having arthritis (61.0%), 20.3% reported heart
disease, and 18.8% had diabetes. The majority
of respondents (58.3%) were aged between 65
and 74, 34.5% aged between 75 and 84, and
7.1% aged between 85 and older. Over half of
respondents (57.6%) were women and non-Latino
white (54.4%). Twenty-two percent were African
American, 5.4% were black Caribbean, 11.4%
were Latino, and 6.6% were Asian. About a third
(32.9%) had incomes of $38,000 or higher. The
remainder of respondents had incomes less than
$37,999,with 17.7% in the lowest income category.
Approximately one third of respondents (30.4%)
had less than 11 years of education, 34.1% had
12 years of education, 18.6% had 13­15 years of
education, and 16.9% had 16 years of education
or more. Overall, respondents reported more days
of role impairment, (M = 4.19) than time out of
role (M = 1.83).

education. Race/ethnicity is related to role impair-
ment but not time out of role. Specifically, African
Americans, black Caribbeans, Latinos, and Asians
report significantly fewer days of impaired role
compared with Whites. Black Caribbeans report
significantly fewer days impaired compared with
African Americans, Asians, and Latinos. There
were no significant differences in role impair-
ment between African Americans, Asians, and
Latinos. As shown in Table 3, whites have the
highest predicted number of days with role impair-
ment on average (M = 5.20), followed by Latinos
(M = 3.68), African Americans (M = 2.61), Asians
(M = 2.14), and black Caribbeans (M = 0.98).
Within-Group Differences
Tables 4 and 5 present the association of
physical disorders and sociodemographic variables
with time out of role and role impairment within
each racial/ethnic group. For whites, having
arthritis was associated with significantly fewer
days out of role, whereas having one or more
chronic illness was associated with more days
out of role compared with those with no illness.
Whites in the highest income category reported
less time out of role than those in the lowest
income group. Among older African Americans,
income and education were significant such that
those with a household income of $20,000 and
higher were less likely to report time out of role
than those in the lowest income quartile, whereas
higher education was associated with increased
time out of role. Both diabetes and heart disease
were associated with less time out of role for black
Caribbeans, whereas having one or more chronic
illness increased time out of role. Black Caribbeans
aged 85 and older reported less time out of role as
did those with 12­15 years of education. Among
Asians, those in the highest income and education
categories reported less time out of role. No
covariates were significantly associated with time
out of role for Latinos.
Looking at role impairment,older white,African
American, and Latino women reported more role
impairment than men. Arthritis was associated
with more role impairment for African Americans,
whereas African Americans and black Caribbeans
in the oldest age category reported less impair-
ment. African Americans in the middle income cat-
egories reported less role impairment than those
in the lowest income group. Black Caribbeans and
Asians aged 75­84 reported more role impairment
than those aged 65­74.
Discussion
One strength of this data set is that it allows
us to look at racial and ethnic differences in role
functioning, something that has been overlooked
in previous literature. It has been stated that the
role literature is limited by a focus on young adult-
hood or early midlife and has not addressed issues
of people from less advantaged backgrounds
(Vandewater & Stewart, 2006, p. 77). The results
of the current study shed light on both between-
and within-group differences of ethnically diverse
older adults with chronic illness.
When we looked at differences between racial/
ethnic groups and within the different ethnic
groups, we found there is some interesting descrip-
tive data about how chronic illnesses interact with
roles. Main findings indicate racial/ethnic differ-
ences in role impairment but not time out of role.

The differences on time out of role were not sig-
nificant, indicating that across ethnicities the
impact of the different chronic illnesses is similar.
Although not significant, the predicted number
of days for whites was on average lower than for
other racial/ethnic groups. In light of the double
jeopardy hypothesis, the results do not seem to
support a significantly higher burden of illness on
the part of minorities as reflected in their time out
of role. These results may provide evidence for the
concept of leveling, where differences based on
race and ethnicity level out as people age (Kim &
Miech, 2009).
Time out of role was measured in this study
as the number of days in the past 30 that the
participant was totally unable to complete their
normal activities. Of the two measures, this one
is clearly the more extreme. The older adults with
chronic illness in this sample are not experiencing
this complete inability to participate in their roles as
often as they experience some impairment. Perhaps
those who are aged 65 and over are reluctant to
say they are completely unable to participate in
their social roles, as this could be disempowering
(Turner, 1990), or may not be acceptable within
their family or cultural context. Prior research on
chronic illness and family dynamics has found that,
for minorities,roles within their social networks are
defined in cultural ways (Gallant et al., 2010). This
cultural understanding of role may be incongruent
with the notion of being completely unable to
participate, despite physical health problems.
When considering the within-group results, we
see that there are some racial/ethnic differences
in how the different disorders are associated with
time out of role and role impairment. Interestingly,
we only found associations in some of the groups:
for whites, arthritis was associated with fewer days
out of role, for black Caribbeans both arthritis and
diabetes were associated with less time out of role,
and for African Americans arthritis was associated
with more role impairment. Having one or more
illness was associated with more time out of role
for both whites and black Caribbeans and that
association increased with the number of illnesses
reported. The lack of an association between time
out of role and increasing numbers of chronic ill-
nesses among African Americans, Latinos, and

Asians bears further investigation. Perhaps there
are culturally bound factors that are functioning
to buffer illness intrusiveness in these groups.
Income was somewhat protective for whites,
African Americans, and Asians, as we saw associa-
tions between higher income and less time out of
roleandlessroleimpairmentforAfricanAmericans.
Education was negatively related to time out of
role for Asians and black Caribbeans. This indi-
cates that socioeconomic status is an important
factor in time out of role for several of the racial
and ethnic groups in this study. Increasing age was
actually found to be associated with decreases in
both days out of role and role impairment. Asian
older adults were the only subgroup that reported
more time out of role and role impairment as age
increased, which may indicate that this is the period
when Asian American older adults are more likely
to exit work-related roles or to diminish role par-
ticipation overall. Gallant and coworkers (2010)
found that older Asian American immigrants have
difficulty adjusting to cultural family structures in
the U.S. context because their children tend to be
more acculturated and perform fewer customs of
filial piety. The NLAAS sample used in the analysis
contains a high number of immigrant older Asians.
The Asian American older adults in this sample
may be more vulnerable to feeling disconnected,
which can result in less support to continue roles.
At the same time, older black Caribbeans and
African Americans may report decreases in role
disruption, in part, because the expectation of their
social role changes with age.
Whites had the most role impairment, followed
by Latinos, African Americans, Asians, and then
black Caribbeans. The finding that whites were
more debilitated by chronic illness, as measured by
role impairment, in comparison to the other ethnic
groups is unexpected, particularly in light of the
double jeopardy hypothesis. This may be because
whites with chronic illness have more freedom to
underperform in the fulfillment of their roles than
is available to racial and ethnic minorities. The
burden to perform a role and not admit defeat may
be a cultural relic that older adults from different
cultures share. African Americans and Latinos
often care for multiple persons in a household
(i.e., parent, spouse, grandchildren, etc.) (Gallant

et al., 2010). Having multiple care roles may create
a situation that does not support having any role
impairment. We also must consider the way that
role impairment was measured in this study. Study
participants were asked to report the number of
days in the past 30 that they had cut down on what
they did or did not get as much done as usual, cut
back on the quality of their work or how carefully
they worked, or had to make an extreme effort to
perform their work or other normal daily activi-
ties at the usual level. These concepts may not have
been as relevant to the non-White respondents. It
is also a possibility that the severity or length of ill-
ness that the whites in this sample had was higher
therefore contributing to the differential impair-
ment in their roles.
Study results need to be examined in light
of several limitations. First, the cross-sectional
nature of the study does not allow us to make
statements regarding causation. In addition,
chronic illness is measured as presence or absence
of that illness at any time during the participant's
lifetime and relied on self report of chronic
condition. Research has found that self report
is generally accurate (Kriegsman, Penninx, van
Eijk, Boeke, & Deeg, 1996; National Center for
Health Statistics, 1994), but we have neither
outside verification of the presence of the chronic
illness nor information about severity of illness.
This study was also limited by the way that role
disruption was measured, using only days out
of role and role impairment, and not having
data available about the participation in, nor
importance of, said roles of participants. Prior
research has found that importance, or salience,
of a role can have differential impact on aging
adults (Abraído-Lanza, 1997; Krause, 1999).
Both role impairment and time out of role
asked for response about the last 30 days, and
this may not accurately reflect the impact that a
chronic illness has had on an older person's life.
If at the time of the interview, the participant
was experiencing a particularly difficult month,
then this would bias their answers to these
items. Finally, although we were able to examine
differences among blacks by comparing black
Caribbeans and African Americans, Asians and
Latinos are also heterogenous groups that need
further consideration. Data on Asian and Latino
subgroups are available; however, when the
analysis is restricted to those aged 65 and older
as in this study, the sample sizes are too small to
examine these subgroup differences further.
Implications for Practice
Professionals who work with older adults
with chronic illness can use these results to bet-
ter understand how to tailor interventions. The
results reinforce the notion that culture should
be taken into account when looking at chronic
disease management (August & Sorkin, 2011;
Han et al., 2010; Samuel-Hodge, Cene, Corsino,
Thomas, & Svetsky, 2012). This study adds to the
growing body of literature on social roles in aging
and adds the perspective of racial and ethnic dif-
ferences. Chronic illness intrusion on roles may
not follow the expected pathways, as we found
that complete inability to participate in roles
was less of a concern, and that Whites had more
role impairment than other racial/ethnic groups.
Older adults who are members of racial and
ethnic minorities should be the focus of further
study to understand what aspects of their culture
are interacting with their social roles to produce
less impairment in comparison to whites. Future
research should focus on intragroup differences,
especially in the context of culture. Looking at the
strengths available through a cultural perspective
could open up opportunities to intervene in cul-
turally appropriate ways.
