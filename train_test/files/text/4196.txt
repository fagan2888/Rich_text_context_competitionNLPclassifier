Abstract
This study addresses the question of how established organizations develop new business models over time,
using a process research approach to trace how four business model innovation trajectories unfold. With
organizational learning as analytical lens, we discern two process patterns: "drifting" starts with an emphasis
on experiential learning and shifts later to cognitive search; "leaping," in contrast, starts with an emphasis
on cognitive search and shifts later to experiential learning. Both drifting and leaping can result in radical
business model innovations, while their occurrence depends on whether a new business model takes off
from an existing model and when it goes into operation. We discuss the implications of these findings for
theory on business models and organizational learning.

Introduction
Both scholars and practitioners focus increasingly on business models (BMs) to complement more
traditional units of analysis, such as the product, firm, industry, or network (Amit and Zott, 2001;
Arend, 2013; Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013). A BM defines how an organization creates
and appropriates value and thereby captures essential features of how companies conduct their

business (Zott et al., 2011). Innovative BMs constitute significant sources of competitive advan-
tage and firm performance (Casadesus-Masanell and Zhu, 2013; Desyllas and Sako, 2013; Zott and
Amit, 2007), so organizations are motivated to innovate BMs by making fundamental changes in
the way they create and appropriate value.
Despite the attractiveness of BM innovation, its pursuit faces substantial challenges and is prone
to failure (Pauwels and Weiss, 2008). Difficulties arise due to uncertainty about the effectiveness
of new BMs (Andries and Debackere, 2007) and the complexity of those models, as configurations
of interdependent BM components (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Klang et al., 2014).
Interactions among components make the development of an effective configuration more difficult
because none of the components can be considered in isolation, and their possible interactions
increase the number of effects to take into account (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000), especially under
uncertainty, when those interactions remain unknown.
Further complications arise for established firms that develop their new BM in parallel with an
existing one (Mezger, 2014). BM innovation in established firms may draw on components of an
existing configuration to create synergies (Kim and Min, 2015; Markides and Charitou, 2004), but
it also may suffer from forces of inertia acting on its components, as well as potential conflicts
between old and new BMs (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000). These
challenges raise questions about how established firms might still find ways to pursue BM
innovation.
So far though, the process of BM innovation in established firms has received insufficient
research attention (Arend, 2013; Demil et al., 2015). Publications that have attended to the process
dimensions of BM innovation offer conflicting assumptions and findings: some emphasize the
design of BMs (e.g. Chatterjee, 2013; Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), others emphasize emergent,
iterative processes such as trial-and-error learning and experimentation (Dmitriev et al., 2014;
McGrath, 2010; Sosna et al., 2010) or suggest that design may be followed by refinement or adjust-
ment after the BM has been implemented (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Demil and Lecocq, 2010;
Lehoux et al., 2014). Moreover, only few studies provide comparative investigations of BM inno-
vation in the specific context of established firms (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Mezger, 2014; Sánchez
and Ricart, 2010). In particular, we lack insight into how the specific challenges for established
firms affect the process of innovation as it unfolds over time.
The question that we address in this article is the following: How do business model innovation
processes unfold over time in established organizations? To answer this question, we investigated
multiple cases (Eisenhardt, 1989) using a process research approach to trace trajectories of BM
innovation in established firms (Langley, 1999; Pettigrew, 1990). We considered BM innovation
relative to a firm's existing BM(s) (e.g. Massa and Tucci, 2014) and we studied four cases in which
established firms added a new BM to existing one(s). We use organizational learning theory as an
analytical lens (Levitt and March, 1988) because several authors have referred to innovation in
general (e.g. Garud and Van de Ven, 1992), and BM innovation in particular (e.g. Mezger, 2014;
Sosna et al., 2010) as a learning process. Moreover, we draw on the distinction between cognitive
search and experiential modes of organizational learning, which have been used before to investi-
gate dynamics in complex systems of interdependent components (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000).
We contribute to literature on BMs in several ways. First, we advance the BM concept by argu-
ing that it has both cognitive and action dimensions, which form a generative duality. Second, we
provide systematic insights into the processes of BM innovation in established organizations,
which involve multiple learning mechanisms. This integrates and extends prior studies that suggest
single modes of learning and shows the distinct and complementary contributions of cognitive
search and experiential learning mechanisms. Third, we show that these mechanisms combine into
two distinct patterns that either start from cognitive search and shift to experiential learning (which
Berends et al. 183
we label "leaping") or else start with experiential learning and move to cognitive search (which we
label "drifting"). The drifting pattern differs from dominant conceptions of BM innovation and
shows that a process that starts incrementally can also lead to radical BM innovation. We find that
differences between the leaping and drifting patterns depend on the degree to which a BM innova-
tion trajectory can take off from an existing BM configuration and whether the BM can go into
operation early. Finally, we explain how the relation of new BMs to existing BMs of established
organizations affects the BM innovation process.
Theoretical background
Business models
A common feature of BM conceptualizations is that they consider BMs as configurations of multi-
ple components (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Morris et al., 2005). Researchers use vari-
ous labels to characterize BM components (Zott et al., 2011). Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010)
propose a widely used, detailed framework: A value proposition is the core component; activities,
resources, partnerships, and cost structure are the components needed for value creation; and cus-
tomer segments, customer relationships, distribution channels, and revenue streams define how
value gets delivered and how some of that value may be captured. This conceptualization is used
in several academic studies (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Ghezzi, 2013), and the components can be
mapped onto other frameworks (Morris et al., 2005; Zott et al., 2011), so it represents a good
choice for our analysis.
As a configuration of components, a BM involves interdependent strategic decisions. The effec-
tiveness of any set of BM components depends heavily on the interactions among those compo-
nents, as was evident in the example of Polaroid shifting from instant printing photography to
digital photography, without changing its revenue model (Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000). This charac-
teristic of BMs--namely, that they feature interdependent components--relates them to broader
management literature that considers combinations of interdependent decision variables (Billinger
et al., 2014; Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000), which may display complementarities (Milgrom and
Roberts, 1995) or "fit" (Siggelkow, 2001). When a BM achieves fit, it consists of a coherent set of
reinforcing choices (Morris et al., 2005). Mismatches instead occur when BM components have
adverse or conflicting implications for other components (Lehoux et al., 2014).
The configurational nature of BMs complicates the process of BM innovation because the
underlying interactions among BM components may be hard to predict and difficult to change over
time (Demil and Lecocq, 2010). BM innovation involves changes in multiple components, and the
eventual outcomes depend on the interactions between all components involved. This adds to the
uncertainty associated with BM innovation, making it hard to predict a priori whether a particular
BM will succeed (Andries and Debackere, 2007; Cavalcante et al., 2011; McGrath, 2010).
In established firms that pursue a new BM alongside an existing one, the existing configuration
of components may help or hinder the establishment of new BMs. A new BM might have synergy
with the existing model, when the old and the new models share some components, such as tech-
nological resources (Kim and Min, 2015; Markides and Charitou, 2004; Sabatier et al., 2010). The
existing configuration may also create cognitive inertia because existing BMs shape managerial
thinking and distort perceptions of novel opportunities (Cavalcante et al., 2011; Tripsas and Gavetti,
2000). Existing configurations also create structural barriers when new uses of components con-
flict with the relations of those components embedded in the existing configuration (Chesbrough,
2010). The associated conflicts of interest may create internal resistance (e.g. Chesbrough and
Rosenbloom, 2002).

BM innovation and organizational learning
To better understand the process of BM innovation, we use organizational learning as a theoretical
lens, so that we can leverage a fundamental duality. That is, BMs have been conceptualized as both
cognitive artifacts and patterns of action (Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010; Massa and Tucci,
2014). On the one hand, BMs have been viewed as a cognitive phenomenon (Furnari, 2015;
Martins et al., 2015) and described as representations (Arend, 2013; Morris et al., 2005; Perkmann
and Spicer, 2010), cognitive instruments (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013), heuristics
(Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002), logics (Teece, 2010), and blueprints (Osterwalder and
Pigneur, 2010). These views assert that BMs exist in a cognitive domain. On the other hand, the
concept of BMs is used to refer to what organizations do, such that they have been defined as activ-
ity systems (Zott and Amit, 2010), sets of routines (Winter and Szulanski, 2001), or patterns of
action (Brousseau and Penard, 2007). We use this duality of representation (cognition) and reality
(action) as key to understand the process of BM innovation by drawing on literature on organiza-
tional learning.
Cognition and action iterate in processes of organizational learning (Fiol and Lyles, 1985). We
draw on the distinction between two basic modes of organizational learning: cognitive search and
experiential learning (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000; Levitt and March, 1988). In cognitive search,
action follows cognition; in experiential learning, cognition follows action (Gavetti and Levinthal,
2000). We use this organizational learning lens to investigate how BM innovation comes about
through interactions between cognition and action.
Existing literature on how to generate BM innovation can also be categorized according to these
two modes. Cognitive search refers to a forward-looking process: a cognitive representation is
used to create and select alternatives according to their consequences. Some studies emphasize the
primacy of the cognitive domain in BM innovation (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Furnari, 2015).Aspara
et al.'s (2011) historical study of Nokia, for example, describes how top managers' cognitions of
change in the corporate environment informed their search for and decisions about changes to the
composition of Nokia's businesses and their value-creating linkages. Moreover, several normative
models for designing BMs have been presented that emphasize forward-looking analytical pro-
cesses suggesting that BMs have to be conceived first, then put into action (Chatterjee, 2013;
Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010).
Experiential learning instead is backward looking. The basic process of experiential learning is
that past experiences get encoded in routinized actions, such that successful actions are retained,
and failures are abandoned (Levitt and March, 1988). Indeed, others have described BM innova-
tion as a process that emerges primarily from the domain of action, captured in concepts such as
experimentation (McGrath, 2010), effectuation (Chesbrough, 2010; Sitoh et al., 2014), and trial-
and-error learning (Mezger, 2014; Sosna et al., 2010). In experiential learning, the relation between
cognition and action is reversed: action and its effects are the sources of learning. Thus, both cogni-
tive search and experiential learning involve action and cognition, but in opposite sequences.
Experiential learning and cognitive search bring about different dynamics in configurations of
interdependent components. A basic assumption is that complex interactions among components
yield "rugged" performance landscapes, in which particular combinations form "local peaks"
(Levinthal, 1997), depending on the extent and type of interactions (Rivkin and Siggelkow, 2007).
Most research on learning processes in these rugged landscapes focuses on experiential learning
(Billinger et al., 2014), which is characterized by local search as it responds to outcomes of nearby
alternatives (Cyert and March, 1963). Especially when complex interactions create local peaks,
experiential learning may become trapped in one part of the landscape, even if other areas would
offer better outcomes (Levinthal, 1997).
Berends et al. 185
In contrast, cognitive representations may help make long jumps to distant parts of the land-
scape (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000). Through cognitive search, actors can play around with more
elements than would be available to them through experiential learning, such that they come up
with different solutions and outcomes. Cognitive search can be enabled by analogical reasoning
(Gavetti et al., 2005; Martins et al., 2015) and imitation of others (Rivkin, 2000). Yet, cognitive
representations are always simplified (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000; Gavetti and Rivkin, 2007).
Especially in uncertain conditions, the effectiveness of strategic search and planning is limited by
unforeseen contingencies and changes, both within the firm and in its external environment
(Gruber, 2007; McGrath, 2010; Mintzberg and Waters, 1985).
To advance theoretical understanding of BM innovation processes, we investigate the contribu-
tions and interactions of both cognitive search and experiential learning. Both modes of learning
have been identified in the BM innovation literature (Martins et al., 2015), and we seek to deter-
mine how they combine and interact in BM innovation processes. Initial theoretical explorations
offer a foundation by analyzing the interaction of cognition and action over time (Gavetti and
Levinthal, 2000; Gavetti and Rivkin, 2007). We specify our research question accordingly: How do
BM innovation processes in established organizations progress through cognitive search and expe-
riential learning over time?
Methods
Our research aim is best characterized as theory elaboration (Vaughan, 1992) with regard to inno-
vation in BMs. Theory elaboration means that our study builds on pre-existing models and concep-
tual ideas and aims to refine concepts, relations, and their explanatory limits (Lee et al., 1999).
Theory elaboration deploys procedures similar to theory generation (Eisenhardt and Graebner,
2007; Locke, 2001) and requires a similar open research attitude to avoid premature closure
(Vaughan, 1992: 176).
To answer our research question, we adopt a process research approach and investigate how BM
innovation is realized through sequences of events (Langley, 1999; Tsoukas and Chia, 2002). We
deployed longitudinal studies to depict the evolution of actual processes in their natural environ-
ment. Furthermore, our open and iterative approach to data collection and analysis enables us to
explore and refine our conceptualization of process dynamics (Strauss, 1987).
The study follows replication logic, investigating multiple independent BM innovation
trajectories to seek potential corroboration of the findings (Yin, 2008). We used a purposeful
sampling strategy to select information-rich cases that can reveal insights into issues of impor-
tance to the inquiry (Patton, 2002). We focused on BMs rather than firms and used BM innovation
trajectories as primary unit of analysis. We selected cases that shared similar features, as that
allows for meaningful comparison in cross-case analysis and increases the likelihood that simi-
larities and differences between cases have theoretical significance (Gerring, 2007). Specifically,
we selected cases that met the following criteria: (1) The BM that resulted from the trajectory
had to be new to the firm, so that BM innovation was both strongly present and transparently
observable (Pettigrew, 1990); (2) The trajectory also had to be relatively new for its sector and
therefore a challenging endeavor, with much uncertainty and limited opportunities to imitate
other firms (Rivkin, 2000); (3) The initiatives had to be undertaken by established firms, which
had at least one working BM; (4) The trajectories had to be technology intensive to limit variety
among the cases (Gerring, 2007); and (5) BM innovation had to be recently realized, and firms
had to approve the non-anonymous disclosure of findings to increase the data collection reliability
(Gibbert, Ruigrok & Wicki 2008). We gained in-depth access to four cases that met these crite-
ria, which we introduce below.
186 Strategic Organization 14(3)
Phenom was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize a new tabletop scanning electron
microscope (SEM), later labeled "Phenom." This trajectory was executed by FEI (established in
1971; 1700 employees), which was the first organization to introduce such a tabletop SEM. While
FEI usually focused on increasing performance levels of electron microscopy, the new microscope
instead filled the performance gap between optical microscopes and low-end electron microscopes
that were on the market at that time. While it started as a product development trajectory, it eventu-
ally required changes in most of the other BM components, including customer relationships,
partnerships, and cost structures, due to interdependencies between components. The initiative was
spun off in the end due to the lack of synergy with FEI's main BM.
Exhibits.nl was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize a portfolio of custom-made exhib-
its as standardized exhibits, sold via the Internet, starting in 2005. This new BM was developed by
Bruns (established in 1963; 70 employees), which mainly focused on creating one-of-a-kind sys-
tems for museums and exhibitions before. For Bruns, all the components of the new "Exhibits.nl"
BM changed compared to the old BM. The main changes were in the value proposition, new cus-
tomer segments, and revenue model, triggering related adaptations in the other BM components.
This new model was initiated because management wanted to differentiate, to spread risk, and
reuse exhibit designs that were developed in one-of-a-kind projects. Bruns was first among its
competitors to offer both custom-made and standardized exhibits.
MiPlaza was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize a bundle of research services of
electronics firm Philips (established 1891; 125,000 employees). For long Philips' research, activi-
ties were internally oriented and fenced off from the outside world. With this new initiative, even-
tually labeled "MiPlaza," Philips opened up its research facilities to others--a major step for a
technology-based firm. Several support departments of Philips' central research and development
(R&D) organization started offering research services such as analysis, measurement, and proto-
typing and consulting services to outside parties such as R&D labs of multinationals and start-ups
to generate new revenues using Philips' research support infrastructure. In the end, all the BM
components were changed. Initial adaptations in the value proposition, activities, resources, and
customers triggered changes in interdependent components such as the development of alternative
customer relationships and new partnerships. Philips has been considered as a frontrunner in the
use of such open BMs (Chesbrough and Garman, 2009).
Waste no more was a BM innovation trajectory to commercialize high-quality recycled
materials and facilitate closed loops, thereby coupling supply and demand of materials for cus-
tomers. This new BM was developed by waste management company Van Gansewinkel (estab-
lished 1964; 5800 employees). BM innovation started with the renewal of activities, resources,
and revenue streams, which gradually led to necessary changes in other components such as
customer relationships and partnerships. This initiative was regarded as a means to escape com-
moditization of the waste management market and generate new revenue streams. The innova-
tive nature of Van Gansewinkel's approach has been acknowledged in a Nature article (Wise
et al., 2013).
So, these BM innovation trajectories were similar on key dimensions: they resulted in a BM that
was new to the firm and relatively new to its sector, which was operated within an established firm
besides an existing BM or a portfolio of BMs, with a significant role for technology. Yet, the cases
also differed. As a consequence of the selection criterion that the new BM had to be new relative
to its sector, it was impossible to have cases from the same sector. Moreover, the companies in
which the BM innovation trajectories were embedded had different sizes, with potential differ-
ences in scope of the existing BM portfolio. This variety adds to the robustness of findings
(Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007), but also opens up the possibility of alternative explanations, to
which we will return in the Discussion section.

Data collection
Our data collection focused on tracking changes in BM components and their interdependen-
cies during the new model's first years of development. Interviews were our primary data
source, which we triangulated with archival data to enhance validity (Jick, 1979; Yin, 2008).
We began by interviewing informants who played a central role in the development of the new
business, according to suggestions from industry contacts and media coverage of the initiatives.
Then, we applied snowball sampling to identify additional interviewees, following the sugges-
tions made in the initial interviews (Patton, 2002). We sought interviewees with multiple back-
grounds and perspectives, including managers, employees, and external stakeholders involved
in the BM innovation trajectory. Interviewing multiple informants mitigated the potential biases
of any individual respondent because the information could be corroborated by several sources
(Gibbert et al., 2008). At least three sources of information contributed to each episode that we
analyzed. In total, we interviewed 39 respondents, some of them twice (see Table 1). The inter-
views were recorded and transcribed verbatim (except for a few interviews at one organization
where some interviewees chose not to allow recording; two interviewers took notes at those
interviews, which were transcribed within 24hours). The interviews were conducted in 2011
and 2012.
The interviews were semi-structured by a protocol to enhance reliability (Yin, 2008). They typi-
cally started with a question asking interviewees to explain their personal background, position,
and history in the organization. Then they recounted the history of the BM innovation trajectory as
it unfolded over time. During this explanation, we frequently prompted interviewees for further
details. In particular, we ensured that they discussed all developments and changes in the BM com-
ponents, including the value proposition, customer segments, distribution channels, customer rela-
tionships, revenue streams, activities, resources, partnerships, and cost structures (Osterwalder and
Pigneur, 2010). Some interviewees used the term "BM" explicitly to discuss how the business
initiative differed from their existing business. In other interviews, we prompted respondents to
specify any differences regarding specific components of their pre-existing BM and how and why
these differences arose. Our questions aimed to uncover concrete events, factual data, and actual
behavior, which help increase reporting accuracy (Huber and Power, 1985). Later interviews were
aided by an emerging timeline, so that interview time could be used effectively to fill gaps in our
understanding and validate earlier accounts.
We triangulated these interview data with both internal and external archival data (see Table 1),
such as business plans, presentations, annual reports, company brochures, press releases, media
articles, and public interviews about the new BM, its host organization, or direct competitors (Jick,
1979). These sources of data helped specify and verify dates of events and develop a reliable chro-
nology of the BM innovation trajectory. The same documents also helped us prepare for inter-
views, in that they provided background and in-depth insights. Overall, the combination of
interview and archival data enabled a rich, reliable understanding of the BM innovation
trajectories.
Data analysis
The first step in our analysis involved within-case analyses to develop comprehensive case narra-
tives (Eisenhardt, 1989; Langley, 1999). These case descriptions contained the original BM(s) of
the organization and the development of the new BM. Both were described according to the BM
components identified by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010), whose conceptualization offers an
effective tool for communicating with practitioners. Moreover, the initial case descriptions

contained an overview of each BM innovation trajectory. We sent each case description to key
informants at the pertinent organization to check for validity (Gibbert et al., 2008). Their feedback
resulted in minor revisions to the case narratives.
Berends et al. 189
As the second step in the within-case analysis, we analyzed BM innovation trajectories as
sequences of learning episodes, similar to Bingham and Davis (2012). We identified distinct learn-
ing episodes in the case histories as embedded unit of analysis (Yin, 2008), which formed the basis
for further process analyses (Langley, 1999; Poole et al., 2000). Learning episodes involved a
coherent set of actions, analyses, reflections, or proposals that resulted in, or were based on,
increased understanding. Moreover, episodes had to be significant to the development of the new
BM, such that they affected the direction and progress of the trajectory. Some unfolded as longer
term trends; for these episodes, we dated the moment they first emerged. The resulting sequences,
which included between 9 and 31 episodes each, mapped the evolution of the new BM. We main-
tained the chain of evidence to ensure construct validity (Yin, 2008); for each episode, we noted
relevant data sources, and we coded interview segments pertaining to each episode in qualitative
data analysis software.
In the third step, we operationalized the two basic types of organizational learning by distin-
guishing specific learning mechanisms. The identification of mechanisms was based on the itera-
tive combination of prior literature and our empirical data. Using open, inductive analysis as
complement to previous theory enables "extending and refining ... existing theoretical categories
and relationships" (Locke, 2001: 103). We systematically compared episodes and discussed them
in the research team (Strauss, 1987) and related these episodes where possible to learning mecha-
nisms known from literature without restricting ourselves to a predefined set of categories. This
process resulted in a framework of four mechanisms used by the established organizations to
develop and refine new BM configurations. Table 2 contains the coding scheme, including the defi-
nitions of the mechanisms, empirical indicators for each mechanism, and illustrative quotes. More
quotes related to the different mechanisms appear in Appendix 1.
Two mechanisms are characterized primarily by cognitive search: conceptualization and crea-
tion. Conceptualization refers to the development of concepts, ideas, and analyses for one or more
BM components and their interactions, without actually changing or creating any of the compo-
nents. Conceptualization may occur before any aspect of the BM gets implemented. As such, it has
been described as "learning-before-doing" by Pisano (1994). Conceptualization may also concern
the reconceptualization of existing operations, as reinterpretation of past and present can be a key
learning process (Hernes and Irgens, 2013). Creation refers in this study to the actual realization of
new BM components or a new, essential part of components, primarily informed by preceding
analyses of components and the interactions among them. While it shares with conceptualization
that it is rooted in cognitive search, creation means that ideas are also implemented in reality. As
such, it relates to what Miner and Mezias (1996) call "generative learning." Creation primarily
relies on cognitive search through the ideation and analysis of BM components and their relation
with other components.
Two other mechanisms characterize experiential learning: adaptation and experimentation.
Adaptation means changing BM components and their interactions according to experiences gath-
ered while the BM was in operation. The adaptation of BM components can be more or less radical,
in reaction to misfits or (partly) positive outcomes. It covers what others have called trial-and-error
learning (Bingham and Davis, 2012; Sosna et al., 2010). Experimentation, or experimental learn-
ing (Bingham and Davis, 2012), entails purposeful actions to learn: planning, designing, and exe-
cuting relatively controlled situations to develop new knowledge and validate existing forms.
Similar to adaptation, experimentation relies on learning from experience, but experimental learn-
ing differs because it only concerns experiences that are intentionally evoked with learning as main
purpose.

The fourth step in the analysis involved coding all learning episodes with this set of mecha-
nisms, as well as coding the BM component(s) in each of the four trajectories. Coding the dis-
tinct episodes required understanding of prior developments in the case history (Pettigrew, 1990)
and the use of multiple data sources (Pratt, 2009). This holistic understanding was aided by
integrating interpretations of multiple researchers. Coding was performed by two members of
the research team who had been involved in data collection and at least one additional researcher,
who was more distant and could serve as a "devil's advocate" and challenge interpretations
(Nemeth et al., 2001). These analytical steps involved iterations, and the final coding process
resulted in some refinements to the prior identification of learning episodes in the BM innova-
tion trajectories.
As the final step in the analysis, we compared the four learning trajectories to gain insights into
how BM innovation trajectories unfold over time. We first compared the distribution of dominant
mechanisms in the episodes over the BM innovation trajectories. Next, we compared the four BM
innovation trajectories for continuity and change in the learning mechanisms, grouped into the two
overarching learning modes. This step led to the identification of two main patterns, each of which
fits two cases. Finally, we explained both patterns according to the specific conditions of the BM
innovation trajectories.

Findings
Learning trajectories in the BM innovation process
The four BM innovation trajectories consisted of multiple episodes (42 in total), characterized by
a multitude of dynamics. Appendix 1 contains for each BM innovation trajectory the key episodes
in chronological order. These episodes map the evolution of the new BM, and for each episode,
we identified which learning mechanism dominated. Although highlighting a single mechanism
in each episode meant abstracting away from some of the complexities in the case histories, it also
enabled a better view of the overall trajectory. For each episode, Appendix 1 also indicates the
BM component(s) addressed in that episode and the interactions between these components as
changes unfolded, together with illustrative quotes. Appendix 2 gives for each innovation trajec-
tory an overview of the original BM that was most related to the new BM at the start of the tra-
jectory, and, at the right-hand side of the table, the final BM components at the end of the BM
innovation trajectory. The tables summarize for each learning episode the BM components that
evolved during that episode. Appendix 2 shows that many BM components evolved several times
over the innovation trajectory, indicating processual relationships across episodes. Appendix 2
also indicates that multiple BM components are touched upon in individual episode due to inter-
actions between these components. These interactions are further explained for each episode in
Appendix 1.
Patterns emerge when we shift attention from episodes to the full trajectories. We find two dis-
tinct patterns that characterize learning trajectories according to cognitive search and experiential
learning: two of the four trajectories--FEI's Phenom and Bruns'Exhibits.nl--initially emphasized
cognitive search mechanisms (conceptualization and creation), then shifted to experiential learning
mechanisms (adaptation and experimentation), but the other two cases--Philips' MiPlaza and Van
Gansewinkel's "Waste no More"--initially emphasized learning from experiences and only later
shifted more toward cognitive search.
Pattern 1: from cognitive search to experiential learning
FEI's Phenom and Bruns' Exhibits.nl trajectories began with emphasis on cognitive search. The
Phenom trajectory started as a product development activity but turned into a radically different
BM, which eventually spun off (similar to cases described by Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002).
As Appendix 2 shows, all its BM components changed over time. For a long time, the core value
proposition of FEI had been to offer high-end SEM systems, incorporating the latest developments
to increase image quality on sub-micron and atomic levels. Customers included leading research
institutes, universities, national laboratories, and industrial companies, which employ dedicated
microscopists for research and development.
By 1995, the company had pushed the boundaries of miniaturization and developed an electron
microscopy column about the size of a cigar. After a failed application in the semiconductor indus-
try, around 2003­2004, FEI began to conceptualize an easy-to-use, tabletop SEM. This trajectory
continued with creation processes, as researchers worked to realize breakthroughs deemed neces-
sary to develop a relatively inexpensive, usable system around the small column. Partial success
spurred multiple episodes of conceptualization and creation, in which FEI started to develop a
business plan, analyzed pricing and potential customers, and formulated a tentative value proposi-
tion, such that the tabletop concept might fill the gap between optical and electron microscopy.
These BM components and interactions were designed on the basis of collected information,
including interviews with about 35 potential customers. Early in 2005, FEI articulated a product
concept, called Phenom, and a business owner and developer were appointed to manage the devel-
opment of the concept, as well as its introduction into the market.
Berends et al. 193
Meanwhile, top managers at FEI also started arguing that a low-cost SEM did not really fit
FEI's culture. To be manufactured, Phenom would require operations vastly different from FEI's
traditional BM of highly customized, low-volume production, shifting to much more cost-efficient,
mid-volume production. Early in 2005, FEI's business developer contacted a consortium of small
suppliers that had joined forces in an effort to become knowledge-intensive system suppliers
(Table 4, episode 4). The consortium previously had approached FEI seeking actual projects to
work on, and Phenom offered a mutually beneficial opportunity. Several consortium members
agreed to co-invest under a risk­reward model to help develop the tabletop SEM. This unantici-
pated partnership could solve both FEI's financing and culture problems, while the suppliers gained
an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities.
After this period of predominantly cognitive search, the Phenom trajectory entered several epi-
sodes of experimentation and adaptation that moved it further beyond product development into
BM innovation. In 2006, the team at FEI was ready to test a prototype of the new tabletop SEM as
well as the associated value proposition of the BM. In an experimental setup with defined customer
segments, FEI approached potential users to test the value proposition of a beta version.
The product's market launch triggered several episodes, from which the Phenom team learned
and engaged in adaptation and experimentation. The Phenom microscope was introduced in
Germany in October 2006, then in the United States in June 2007. However, it failed to meet sales
targets: instead of 2500 systems, only a few hundred systems had shipped by the end of 2008. The
development of this new market appeared harder than anticipated because of FEI's inexperience
selling the system, as well as the emerging global financial crisis. Team members learned that FEI's
distribution structure and sales approach, which were leveraged from the traditional business to the
new BM, were better suited for selling large, complex microscopes than tabletop microscopes.
Because Phenom was not profitable and did not fit the existing FEI sales organization, FEI spun
off Phenom in a structure in which FEI and the supplier partners remained shareholders. Thus,
overall, the Phenom case started with conceptualization and creation episodes and turned more
toward experimentation and adaptation in the second half of the trajectory.
Bruns' Exhibits.nl trajectory displayed a similar shift from cognitive search to experiential
learning. Initially, Bruns developed tailor-made, interactive exhibits for large museums, science
centers, visitor centers, and traveling exhibitions, mainly in Western Europe. It worked closely
with clients and was paid on a project basis. The new BM trajectory was initiated in 2006, when
senior management began looking for ways to increase income predictability, noting the severe
risk of large, one-of-a-kind projects. They also wanted to leverage their excess manufacturing
capacity in their low season and reuse designs. In early conceptualization and creation episodes in
2006 and 2007, Bruns conceived a new BM, later named Exhibits.nl. Instead of offering tailor-
made, interactive exhibits, Exhibits.nl would provide standardized, economically priced, shock-
proof exhibits, purchased online, with limited after-sales service. Bruns analyzed the kind of
customers that might value such standardized exhibits (e.g. smaller museums and science centers)
and which of its existing exhibits might be standardized (with a fee paid to the original client). It
developed a website and a stand at an annual trade fair as sales channels and then created a partner-
ship with a design agency to enhance redesign capabilities. The BM went into operation in 2007,
followed by several episodes of adaptation to develop it further. For example, in 2007, much of the
interest for Bruns' new value proposition originated from emerging economies in the Middle East,
South America, and Asia, according to website data. Therefore, it shifted its attention to these parts
of the world, enabled by the transactional customer relationships it established through its new,
web-enabled BM, which did not require much interaction or after-sales service. Bruns also learned
that it did not need the design agency with which it had initiated Exhibits.nl, leading to the dissolu-
tion of this partnership, but it required intensified marketing efforts. So, whereas cognitive search
dominated in the early episodes, experiential learning came to the fore in the later episodes.
194 Strategic Organization 14(3)
Pattern 2: from experiential learning to cognitive search
Two other trajectories display a different pattern. Philips' MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's "Waste
no More" emphasized experiential learning, rather than cognitive search, in the early phases. Both
started with a reconceptualization of an existing situation, followed by a period dominated by
experiential learning. Cognitive search intensified only in the later phases.
The MiPlaza trajectory at Philips began with the recognition that selling research support ser-
vices represented a business opportunity, in an episode of conceptualization. In the early 2000s, as
open innovation became a buzzword, Philips opened its research campus and embraced a strategy
of open innovation. It reinterpreted existing activities, such as incidental provisions of research
services to spin-offs and other interconnected companies, as manifestations of an open innovation
paradigm. Acts initially performed as a favor to old colleagues and friends became viewed as a
novel BM, already in operation in an embryonic form. Therefore, Philips officially opened a new
clean room and related research services for outside companies and research institutes under the
name MiPlaza in June 2004. Shortly thereafter, Philips' MiPlaza trajectory featured several epi-
sodes of adapting BM components and their interactions, triggered by the growing business and
broadening client base. Specifically, Philips initiated partnerships with equipment manufacturers,
developed additional resources, and strengthened customer relationships.
After these episodes, its cognitive search intensified and became dominant. In 2006, MiPlaza's
senior management realized that the current model was too loosely defined, which led them to
initiate a "One MiPlaza" change program, based on an analysis of MiPlaza's current situation. On
the basis of this analysis, the company conceptualized several changes to BM components and
developed a change plan. This change plan then triggered three creation episodes in 2008 that
strengthened MiPlaza's value proposition and customer relationships, while also developing new
resources and activities, such as a "process house" and ongoing process analysis. The MiPlaza
trajectory thus started with reconceptualization of existing activities, followed by several episodes
of adaptation, and turned to an emphasis on conceptualization and creation in later episodes.
Similarly, Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no More" trajectory displayed a broad shift from experien-
tial learning to cognitive search. It also started with reconceptualization. Van Gansewinkel already
had a small recycling operation, able to offer raw materials such as glass that was regarded as a by-
product of the company's core service, namely, collecting and processing customer waste. Rising
raw materials prices led it to review its activities in a new light. Inspired by a high-profile television
documentary "Waste Equals Food," Van Gansewinkel employees came to see their existing opera-
tions as a materials supplier BM that could compete in the raw materials market. Thus, they appreci-
ated existing raw materials activities and strengthened their importance. The documentary features
Dr. Michael Braungart of the Environmental Protection Encouraging Agency (EPEA), a German
non-profit institute, promoting a "cradle-to-cradle" philosophy. To accelerate its transformation,
Van Gansewinkel enthusiasts created a collaboration with EPEA. The subsequent episodes were
highly experiential, such that employees experimented with projects and adapted the structure to
control the projects. In later phases, Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no More" trajectory showed several
episodes of cognitive search, using conceptualization to strengthen the BM as material supplier and
creation to develop resources and systematize activities. Experiential learning thus was stronger in
the early episodes, but the use of cognitive search dominated in the later ones.
Comparison of patterns
In this section, we explain the contrasting sequences of learning mechanisms in the BM innovation
trajectories and label the two types of trajectories as "leaping" and "drifting." We characterize the
Berends et al. 195
trajectories that started from cognitive search and moved to experiential learning as "leaping"
because they only leveraged a limited number of resources from the traditional business and mainly
start with the conceptualization and creation of new BM components, thereby distancing from the
existing model right from the start, only to shift to experiential learning after going into operation.
We characterize the trajectories that relied mainly on experiential learning initially and moved later
to cognitive search as "drifting" because they gradually drift from the original model while being
in operation and shift to cognitive search to systematize the model when scaling up later in the
process. Below, we first explain the differences in the first parts of the trajectories and then analyze
the shift that occurs in both patterns. Table 3 provides an overview of the differences between these
two types of trajectories.
A key difference between the initiation of the patterns concerns the relationship with the exist-
ing businesses that the organizations had in operation: drifting originates from an existing BM
configuration, whereas leaping mainly starts by developing new interdependent BM components.
The two trajectories that we label as drifting­Philips' MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no
more"­originated from ongoing business. Through reconceptualization, they regarded their ongo-
ing business in a new light, shifting attention to alternative value propositions that could sprout
from their existing business activities. When Philips' R&D organization shifted from an internal
provider of research services to providing services to external clients, it used most of the BM con-
figuration that was already in place (e.g. resources, activities, and relations with external parties),
although some of those components changed substantially later on. Similarly, Van Gansewinkel
worked with existing clients, customer relationships, channels, activities, and resources to develop
its new value proposition. In this drifting process, the role of some of these components changed.
Notably, customers of waste collection services were reframed in the new BM as suppliers of raw
materials. Although Philips' MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no More" moved far away
from the existing BM over time, they took off from an existing, ongoing BM, thereby starting BM
innovation "on the fly."
In contrast, the trajectories at Bruns (Exhibits.nl) and FEI (Phenom), which we label as "leap-
ing," mainly started with the offline development of several new BM components, including the
products that the BMs evolved from and the channels to bring the products to new customers. BM
innovation in Bruns' Exhibits.nl and FEI's Phenom constituted more de novo developments.
Relatedly, the patterns show different moments of going into operation: drifting trajectories are
in operation early and leaping trajectories are in operation relatively late. When BM innovation can
take off from ongoing business, a firm can operationalize an integral BM early, as was the case in
Philips'MiPlaza and Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no More" trajectories. BM development thus took
place in the midst of ongoing operations for clients. In contrast, in FEI's Phenom and Bruns'
Exhibits.nl trajectories, BM components were developed first, which were put into operation later.
These cases had to deal with the sequential dependence of the development of BM components:
The realization of one component may be necessary before other elements can be realized (Sánchez
and Ricart, 2010). For example, for FEI's Phenom, the technology had to be developed first to be
sure that technological resources could support the imagined value proposition. Then, the founda-
tions of other components needed to be developed, such as exploring distribution partnerships
before going into operation. For Bruns, developing a partnership with a design agency to realize
the look and feel of the business was a prerequisite before it could develop the website for Exhibits.nl.
These sequences of developing individual BM components implied a later moment of going into
operation.
It is easy to see how the sequence of learning processes is influenced by the degree to which
the new BM develops from existing business and by the moment of going into operation. Taking
off from existing business allows going in operation early and that enables learning about a
196 Strategic Organization 14(3)
functioning BM from experience. All cases include episodes of adaptation to unexpected problems
or opportunities, which led to further development of the BMs. The earlier a BM is in operation,
the sooner such adaptive learning is possible. The trajectories that started with reconceptualization
of existing activities for novel BMs thus enabled earlier experiential learning. In contrast, the other
trajectories did not originate from ongoing business and went in operation later and therefore relied
more on cognitive search initially.
The second part of the explanation of the two patterns centers on the opposite shifts in learning
mode that occurred roughly halfway along the trajectories: from experiential learning to cognitive
search in the drifting pattern and from cognitive search to experiential learning in the leaping pat-
tern. These shifts have different triggers.
The drifting pattern shifts from experiential learning to cognitive search when scaling up the
BM. In Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no More" trajectory, the shift occurred in episode 6. In episodes
3 and 4, Van Gansewinkel experimented with a new value proposition, and in episode 5, they
adapted their organizational structure to further develop new activities. After experimental projects
had been undertaken, Van Gansewinkel decided to scale up this new BM as exemplary for a new
identity. This triggered episodes of cognitive search to systematically advance the BM. In particu-
lar, episode 8 concerned a systematic analysis of the markets that would be attractive for the firm's
new identity as a materials supplier, sharpening the value proposition for customer segments, and
further specification of the revenue model and cost structure to make the new BM financially via-
ble. Episode 9 further crystallized the internal activities and resources required for a full-scale BM.
Similarly, after Philips' MiPlaza BM had been in operation for some time, the decision to scale
up around episode 6 triggered a shift from predominantly experiential learning to predominantly
cognitive search. This was enabled by the organizational allocation of responsibility for the new
activities in episode 5. The decision to scale up the BM created the need to analyze customer needs
more rigorously, to determine training demands, design a "process house" to formalize internal
business processes in pursuit of formal certification, and strengthen customer relationships in the
following episodes.

Berends et al. 197
In both trajectories that followed the drifting pattern, the early episodes of experiential learning
focused on one or two components and limited interactions at a time (see Appendix 2), such as
experimenting with the value proposition for Van Gansewinkel's "Waste no More" BM. Such
experiential learning regarding few components occurred against the backdrop of the overall con-
figuration, like varying a single parameter in a system while keeping the other parameters stable.
Scaling up required more systematic conceptualizations and analyses, and later cognitive search
mechanisms dealt with the interaction of more BM components and thus a larger search space.
The leaping pattern makes the opposite shift, from cognitive search to experiential learning,
triggered by the new BM going into operation, which occurred in episode 6 of Bruns' Exhibits.nl
trajectory and at episode 9 of the FEI's Phenom trajectory. Going into operation spurred more
experiential learning episodes prompted by misfits among initial BM components that emerged
during actual operation. For example, late in its trajectory, FEI recognized that the sales channels
and customer relationships that were leveraged from the existing business did not fit the novel BM
for the Phenom microscope. Bruns (Exhibits.nl) only realized that its partnership with the design
agency (which owned 50% of the business) was of limited value after its BM had been in full
operation for several years.
The leaping pattern is also different in terms of the number of components and interactions per
episode. The early cognitive search episodes in Bruns' Exhibits.nl and FEI's Phenom trajectories
that occurred when the BMs were not yet in operation for clients involved multiple BM compo-
nents, configuring the BM as interacting variables. While a larger number of BM components as
well as their interactions are considered initially in the leaping pattern, during actual operation, it
shifts to the fine-tuning of specific components.
Discussion
Our study responds to recent calls for research to enhance theoretical understanding of the pro-
cesses of BM innovation in established firms (Arend, 2013; Demil et al., 2015; Massa and Tucci,
2014). We find a "drifting" pattern that originates from an existing BM configuration, goes early
into operation, emphasizes experiential learning in early phases, and shifts to cognitive search
when an organization aims to scale up the BM. In contrast, a "leaping" pattern is mainly initiated
by developing new BM components, goes into operation relatively late, focuses initially on cogni-
tive search, and shifts to experiential learning after the BM goes in operation. Our findings offer
several specific contributions to literature on BM innovation and organizational learning.
First, we advance the BM concept by detailing how its cognition and action dimensions form a
generative duality. This duality can go unnoticed if BMs are in full operation and cognitive repre-
sentations resemble the manifest operational reality. In the process of BM innovation, though,
differences exist between cognition and action, which make that a BM cannot be reduced to either
of these dimensions.ABM is more than what an organization does because current actions may not
yet reflect a BM as conceived, and ongoing activities can be interpreted in multiple ways as dem-
onstrated by the reconceptualizations that initiated BM innovations at Van Gansewinkel and
Philips. Nor can a BM be reduced to a cognitive representation though because interdependencies
among components may be only partially conceived, and understanding of a model may rely on it
being embedded in practice. Thus, whereas some researchers emphasize BMs as patterns of action
(e.g. Winter and Szulanski, 2001; Zott andAmit, 2010) and others consider them cognitive artifacts
(e.g. Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Martins et al., 2015), we argue that a BM cannot be
reduced to either organizational actions or cognitive representations but should be understood as a
duality. Moreover, the duality of these two dimensions makes BMs inherently dynamic and genera-
tive. This generative duality reflects the generative dynamics of organizational routines as general
198 Strategic Organization 14(3)
patterns and specific actions (Feldman and Pentland, 2003). In BM innovation, cognition and
action interact over time to generate new configurations: Actions get reinterpreted, new ideas are
implemented and examined in action, and new patterns of action result in experiences that lead to
altered conceptualizations of actual and possible business activities. Understanding these dynam-
ics requires attention to both dimensions of BMs' dual nature.
Second, we show that BM innovation emerges through combinations of different learning mech-
anisms­each involving a different interaction of cognition and action. Prior studies tend to use sin-
gle process characterizations, focusing on either cognitive search by emphasizing BM design (e.g.
Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010) or experiential processes such as experimentation (McGrath, 2010)
or trial-and-error learning (Sosna et al., 2010). We show that BM innovation processes cannot be
captured with a single mechanism because they involve multiple, contrasting mechanisms in a series
of episodes. Each learning episode concerns a subset of BM components and the complete configu-
ration of components develops across multiple episodes (see also Cortimiglia et al., 2015).
In all trajectories, both cognitive search and experiential learning appeared necessary­albeit in
different sequences. Our findings corroborate the assumption in simulation studies that experiential
learning typically involves a more limited set of decision parameters than cognitive search, as it is
easier to manipulate variables in thought than in reality (Gavetti and Levinthal, 2000). Experiential
learning mechanisms address a few BM components, improving their fit in an integral BM. Cognitive
search mechanisms address more BM components at the same time and are thereby more concerned
with the overall configuration of components and their interdependencies. Thus, our findings show
the distinct, complementary contributions of cognitive search and experiential learning to deal with
the configurational complexity of BMs. This also implies that our findings do not just resemble the
distinction between emergent and deliberate strategy formation (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985)
because all trajectories involve emergence and deliberation, albeit in different sequences.
Third, we identify two process patterns, which we labeled leaping and drifting, with contrasting
sequences of cognitive search and experiential learning. The leaping pattern moves from cognitive
search to experiential learning. In these trajectories, the BM components and their interdependen-
cies are considered and created upfront. A shift occurs when the BM goes into operation, after
which experiential learning helps fine-tune any specific components that do not fit within the con-
figuration. This sequence corresponds to those who argue that fine-tuning or adaptation may be
needed after designed BMs are implemented (Cortimiglia et al., 2015; Lehoux et al., 2014).
The drifting pattern is an alternative trajectory that is not explicitly considered in current literature.
This pattern, in which emphasis shifts from experiential learning to cognitive search, seems typical
for established firms because it originates from ongoing business activities. The pattern poses two
puzzles, though. First, it seems surprising that experiential learning enables substantial divergence
from the initial BM because existing theory suggests that experiential learning cannot escape a local
peak (Levinthal, 1997) and that "revolutionary" approaches are asked for BM innovation (Arend,
2013: 394). A key lies in the use of reconceptualization to initiate BM change. Reinterpreting a cur-
rent configuration, inspired by the concept of "open innovation" by Philips' MiPlaza and "cradle-to-
cradle"byVanGansewinkel,changestheperformancelandscape.Seeninanewlight,thecontributions
of the components to BM performance and their interdependencies change, and the existing configu-
ration no longer offers a local optimum. Moreover, both companies had less stringent demands on
profitability in this period of experiential learning, thereby also reducing the "pull" of a prior local
optimum. Changes in individual components triggered changes in interdependent components
through experiential learning, prompting a greater drift away from the prior equilibrium. Thus, even
though drifting takes off from ongoing business, it allows to deviate radically from it in the end.
Another surprising observation is that the drifting trajectories, which emphasize experiential
learning in the early episodes, also feature a notable shift to cognitive search later in
Berends et al. 199
their trajectories. This shift toward cognitive search has not been documented by those who have
emphasized the experiential nature of BM innovation (e.g. McGrath, 2010; Sosna et al., 2010).After
adaptation and experimentation with core components (e.g. value proposition, customer segments)
showed promising results, the organizations aimed to scale up their new BM operations and thus had
to deal with new interdependencies. Minimal experimentation could tolerate inconsistencies; scal-
ing up required more thorough alignment of all BM components. Thus, the organizational actors
used cognitive search to align a larger set of BM components systematically and as a coherent
configuration.
Overall, this pattern resonates with recent studies of organizational change that document that
incremental changes may culminate into radical change (Girod and Whittington, 2015; Plowman
et al., 2007). Besides revealing a similar phenomenon for BM innovation, we specify that drifting
from an existing BM through subsequent emergent processes may be followed by a more system-
atic analytical approach to consolidate the new BM as a radical departure from the past. These
findings suggest that drifting can be used by incumbent firms to overcome barriers for BM innova-
tion (Chesbrough, 2010) as the initial reconceptualization addresses cognitive constraints upfront
and the gradual process makes it easier to legitimize the ultimately radical BM change.
Fourth, our study contributes to the literature on synergies between different BMs of one firm.
Prior literature suggests that when established firms add new BMs and operate multiple BMs simul-
taneously, they are more successful if the models are connected (Casadesus-Masanell and Tarzijan,
2012; Markides and Oyon, 2010; Sabatier et al., 2010). Indeed, such connections were evident in the
reuse of components in both patterns. Synergies occurred most immediately in the drifting pattern,
where linkages between old and new resulted from reconceptualizations of a significant part of the
existing business as a new BM, such that familiar components gained new meaning.
Literature mostly assumes that the synergies become enacted whenever a certain component of
one BM can be directly reused in the other BM that the firm employs, for example, when certain
resources can be shared (e.g. Markides and Charitou, 2004). However, in two cases, we observed
an indirect reuse, when a certain component of the old BM (i.e. customer segment) became a dif-
ferent component in the new BM (i.e. partners). Moreover, we observed that adaptation frequently
occurred when direct reuse of a BM component resulted in misfits instead of synergy. Adaptation
of BM components helped to resolve such conflicts between the old and the new BM. We observed
that the drifting pattern allowed firms to identify such lack of synergy earlier in the process.
Although it might be argued that a broader BM portfolio, like Philips had, increases options for
reuse and synergy, this did not appear decisive for the nature of BM innovation trajectories, as we
find a similar "drifting" pattern in one of the other firms with only one main BM (i.e. Van
Gansewinkel). This indicates that the number of BMs in a portfolio does not explain much of our
findings. More broadly, size does not appear to differentiate between the two patterns. The two
companies that are smaller in size in terms of employees, FEI and Bruns, displayed the leaping
pattern, whereas the bigger firms displayed the drifting pattern. However, this association is likely
to be accidental and not causal because existing theory suggests that if size would have an effect,
it would point in the opposite direction: prior research found that smaller firms tend to use more
emergent and less planned approaches than large firms (e.g. Berends et al., 2014), whereas in the
present study, the two bigger firms started in a more emergent way.
Boundary conditions, limitations, and further research
Several boundary conditions and limitations of our study deserve to be mentioned and addressed
in future research. We investigated four cases that were similar in several ways, which invites
additional studies of BM innovation trajectories in other settings. In particular, our findings refer
200 Strategic Organization 14(3)
to BM innovations that were new for their sectors, which imply extensive learning in these trajec-
tories. The process of BM innovation may differ when a BM follows a recipe or existing exemplar
(Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010). Learning trajectories may be less complex in such situations,
and followers'approaches may involve more learning from external sources, whereas the cases we
studied drew primarily on their own analyses and experiences. Our findings also pertain to cases in
which new BMs complement existing BMs instead of substituting for them. The dynamics may
differ when a new BM needs to replace an old one (Kim and Min, 2015) because the competition
for attention and resources may strengthen the role of inertia.
The organizations that executed the BM innovation trajectories were regarded mostly as a whole,
ignoring any intra-organizational social dynamics and micro-institutional effects. Any innovation
effort that deviates from an organization's existing businesses likely faces internal resistance, dealing
with which requires leadership (Chesbrough, 2007) and political maneuvering (Van Dijk et al., 2011).
While drifting may potentially help alleviate some of the resistance, additional research is needed to
investigate how intra-organizational dynamics shape BM learning processes. Finally, we did not
include performance as a variable in our analysis. We only selected BM innovations that came to frui-
tion, without differentiating their ultimate contributions to firm performance. To extend this study,
researchers should investigate the performance consequences of different learning trajectories.
Conclusion
BM innovation is a complex process in which action and cognition intertwine. It is not a two-step
process of conception and execution, in which a BM is developed first as a cognitive representation
and then implemented in reality later. Instead, it is a multi-step, multi-mechanism learning process
that can occur through "drifting" and "leaping" patterns. In addition to considering which BM will
be most effective, organizations therefore should consider how they can arrange an effective learn-
ing process to reach a novel BM.

Episodes in the business model innovation trajectories*
*Business model components that interact during a particular episode are highlighted in bold.
Codes between brackets refer to interview sources.
Table 4. Phenom (FEI).
Episode Description
1 2003: Reinvigorating old idea for
"tabletop SEM"
CONCEPTUALIZATION: FEI envisages potential
applications for an innovative miniature "column," a
technological resource for electron microscopy. After
abandoning another potential application, FEI advances the
idea to deliver a "tabletop SEM," with a value proposition
that could be positioned in between optical microscopes
and SEMs. This entails that it had to be cheap, fast, and
easy to use. This value proposition set targets for a cost
structure: "If you want to sell--and at that time we were
thinking about 30,000 Euro--you should get if manufactured for
no more than 15,000" (F6).
2 2003­February 2005: Development
of technology and prototype
CREATION: The roughly conceived value proposition
and cost structure drive the development of technological
resources. "It is more than just the column in the heart of the
machine. So we looked at system aspects, that it would be a self-
contained system with all functionalities" (F10). Breakthroughs
were needed concerning vacuum technology and fast loading
of samples. "And all had to be cheap, that was maybe the most
difficult of all. Costs were the main theme in the project" (F10).
These breakthroughs were realized, and a prototype of a
small electron microscope was presented in February 2005.
3 2005 (February): Developing
business plan, identifying market
gap, customer segments
CONCEPTUALIZATION: A dedicated team works on
developing "a business case." The broad value proposition
gets refined and guides search for specific customer
segments. "FEI was in the top of the pyramid. The market
is not big, but you are high-end super duper. So if you want to
grow, you have to broaden your base, go down in the pyramid.
That means less high-end" (F1). "First, we looked at the way the
market is structured. There is a gap between high-end electron
microscopes and optical microscopes. So if you want to fill that
gap, for whom might that be an interesting product?" (F7).
4 2005 (February): Starting
collaboration with development
partners
CREATION: Creation of partnership with suppliers on a
"risk-reward" basis as "solution" for manufacturing activities
because FEI has little financial resources available for product
development and industrialization and these suppliers aim to
become value added suppliers. "There was no money within FEI
to start projects, so they had to find creative funding opportunities.
Then, [supplier] and [supplier] joined as co-investors, and that
was the way to pull it forward" (F2). This partnership changed
potential revenues and development costs because the
partners were took a larger share of revenues in return
for sharing risk and were used to work with tight cost
structures instead of FEI's focus on high-end solutions.

Episode Description
5 2005: Identifying different use cases CONCEPTUALIZATION: Based on extensive
interviewing, project members identified different "use
cases" that specify the value proposition of the tabletop
microscope for specific customers. "There was a vision of
a cheap SEM, but it was not a product at all. It only became
a product when we started thinking about who will use it and
for what purpose" (F3). It was envisioned that potential
customers were those who could not afford an electron
microscope. Specific use cases concerned forensic research
(e.g. investigating bullets) and materials research (e.g.
surfaces).
6 2005: Start industrialization with
multi-disciplinary team
CREATION: The refined value proposition for envisaged
customer segments ("use cases") was used to guide
further development of technological resources. "We
optimized the device for that" (F3). This technological
development is materialized with the partners, who
take care of realizing the cost structure. "I had a weekly
operational meeting with the most important players involved.
People from [supplier], FEI, [supplier], [supplier] were there,
other suppliers if it was necessary. Then a number of sub-
teams for mechanics, software, electronics, who were busy with
engineering" (F2).
7 2005: Exploring distribution and
sales with partners
CREATION: Because envisioned customers were
not yet served by FEI and resources were limited, the
project team searched for sales partners. After a failed
attempt to distribute the tabletop SEM through optical
microscope companies, FEI sets up a partnership with
a sales outsourcing organization to develop distribution
channels and customer relationships with conceived
customer segments. "[Project Manager] got in contact with
people who were into sales outsourcing and lead generation,
and those were things that we knew we needed, because we
will not just run into customers, certainly not enough customers"
(F1). They agreed fee for the partner reduced potential
revenues.
8 2006: Doing Alpha and Beta testing
with prototype products in the
market
EXPERIMENTING: Based on the initial definition
of customer segments, potential customers are
approached to test the value proposition of a beta
version. This beta testing continues with the formal
product introduction (as "Phenom") at "The Instrument"
fair. "Out of 35 people that we interviewed, we kept about 10
or 8 people who we asked to become a beta client (...) Being
a beta client means that you get it somewhat cheaper, but
you have to work for it, and you have to respect that it will not
always work properly. But we do not want to offer crap. We
prefer to offer something where you can work with and that
offers us useful feedback" (F1).

Episode Description
9 2007: Sales far below expectation
leading to redefinition of market
segment
ADAPTATION: Based upon experiences in the first year,
with sales far below expectations, customer segment and
value proposition are redefined. "After the launch, hell broke
loose. One of the biggest mistakes of the business plan is that we
would attack the market for optical microscopy. We would grab the
market for high-end optical microscopy. Those devices were more
expensive than ours, but more limited. But we did not succeed at all.
Those people did not know what a SEM could do for them. Funnily
enough, to whom did we sell the most? To FEI customers" (F1).
For those existing customers, the value proposition of the
Phenom was complementary to their high-end SEMs: Phenom
for high volume tasks, and a high-end SEM for more demanding
tasks. FEI redefined customer segment as "SEM data users",
who know the value of an SEM, but cannot afford one.
10 2008: Experimenting with sales
approach
EXPERIMENTATION: Because sales are not satisfactory,
people at FEI experiment with alternative distribution
channels using different media to generate awareness of the
Phenom and identify potential customers ("leads"): "So, it is
a real problem how to communicate about this product. Actually,
it is the lead generation problem, and [Marketing manager]
experimented a lot with that" (F6).
11 2009: Suppliers buy Phenom
business from FEI
ADAPTATION: Due to disappointing sales, FEI decided to
stop investing in the tabletop electron microscope business
and spin out the Phenom business. The other partners
take a larger share of the new company to avoid losing
business-specific investments, and FEI keeps a minority share,
thereby changing the nature of the partnership. The spinoff
company is called PhenomWorld: "The size of the business
fitted better in the company that we are now" (F10).
12 2009: Start adapting distribution
structure and sales approach
ADAPTATION: The new business entity adapts distribution
channels and customer relationships, because team
members learned that these were designed for selling large
and complex microscopes and did not fit the value proposition
and cost and revenue structure of the Phenom. "You find
out that Phenom was an odd man out within FEI. It requires a
completely different market approach than traditional SEMs" (F7).
New distributors replaced existing agents:"Now we have our
own distributors for whom we represent a substantial part of their
turnover. So they will work and invest to realize that turnover" (F1).
13 2009: Introducing new software
and accessories
CREATION: Aiming to further specifiy the value
proposition of its tabletop microscope for refined
customer segments in different industries, PhenomWorld
develops new technological resources to introduce new
software and accessories. The customers typically need to
use the Phenom for a specific application. "If you want to grow,
you need to do other things. Develop smart applications, develop
smart holders, bring it up to date. We know what our next step is.
We had a very good strategy session last year, with someone from
outside, who knows electron microscopy well" (F1).

business idea: Standardized exhibits
CONCEPTUALIZATION: Bruns formulates a new
value proposition, standardized exhibits, based on
existing designs from their traditional business: "There
are still so many potential clients (...) they just want to have
a good [standardized] exhibit for a good price, no more
and no less (...) we had a hunch that there was a market
for that" (B4) and receives initial approval from their
traditional customers that they would be OK if Bruns
would pursue this opportunity. The traditional customers
would receive some revenues when one of their designs
would be sold (traditional customers become partners).
"With representatives of some leading museums, we checked
whether they would support the idea" (B9) "because we
developed the designs with them" (B5) "If an exhibit would be
sold, [leading museums of the world] would get a part of the
revenues" (B4).
2 2006: Bruns scans the need for the
new business idea at a large trade
fair
CONCEPTUALIZATION: Bruns conducts market
research at a large trade fair to find out what participants
think about the new value proposition and identifies
that Bruns could bring value. "During Excite 2006 [trade-
fair] we checked how people reacted [to the concept]; we
noticed there was a particular need" (B4). CREATION: To
further conduct market research, Bruns creates a new
channel: A small portion of the Bruns stand is dedicated
to the new BM. "We actually started (...) with a small
group; we had a stand of 3 by 2" (B6).
3 2006: Identifying small museums,
queues at theme parks, and
shopping malls as market focus
CONCEPTUALIZATION: Supported by the positive
experiences at the trade fair, Bruns identifies new
customer segments "We have said (...) small museums,
(...), queues at theme parks, this is what we thought of
beforehand. And indeed ordinary shopping malls" (B1) and
conceptualizes costs: "There are many potential clients who
need exhibits that are of high quality, but often do not want all
kinds of bells and whistles, because that raises the price" (B6)
and customer relationships "[Customers] have to come
pick it up. Do you want it sent, or you want a box around it,
okay, but then you get an additional charge" (B1).
4 2006: Working with a design
agency as strategic partner
CREATION: Realizing their lack of competences in
redesign, Bruns formalizes a relationship with a design
agency (partner) that conducts specific activities such
as the development of aesthetical and visual aspects of
the designs: "At a certain moment, we worked out the idea
with a design office"(B1). "Well as you see, the exhibits, the
technical part has all been built once, but it's the design. It
must also have a certain market value, so it needs to have a
certain look. And therefore you need a design office." (B1)
This partner gets a strategic role in the new BM by
retaining 50% of the generated revenues: "But were they
owner? Yes, 50%. Each had 50% of the business" (B4).

Episode Description
5 2007: Development of a website
as the main communication and
distribution channel for Exhibits.nl
CREATION: By developing a website for
communication and distribution, a channel is created
including a catalog of standardized exhibits: "In the
beginning, we had 80 exhibits on the website" (B5) for a
fixed price (revenue model). "People can download a pdf
from the website when filling in an email address. So we get
a message and I (...) send them a price list and the general
terms" (B6) CONCEPTUALIZATION: Because the
design agency develops graphical designs of the initial
set exhibits for the website, the value proposition
is further developed to include aesthetical appearance.
"And so gradually a whole lot of stuff was thought out,
mainly only on paper (...) when there were orders, we went
building these things and solving all the problems you then
encounter" (B9)
6 2008: Presentation of Exhibits.nl
as a clear alternative to Bruns at
yearly trade fair
ADAPTATION: Triggered by actually operating the
business from 2007 onwards, Bruns creates a separate
stand (channel) at the yearly trade fair for Exhibits.nl
instead of using a small portion on the Bruns stand. "[In
2008] we decided for a double stand at Ecsite [trade-fair],
one for Exhibits.nl and one for Bruns" (B4).
7 2008: Adjusting after-sales service
and introducing procedures
ADAPTATION: Running the business results in gradual
adaptation of intended customer relationships: "Initially
the idea was that the customer would order, we would ship,
and when the product is damaged the customer sends it
back. In practice it does not work like this, and sometimes
we still visit the customer to solve the problem." Internally,
this implies that Bruns has to work with standardized
components instead of ad-hoc solutions, choose
components that are not likely to disappear from the
market, and do proper documentation. This is done by
evaluating each project and refining activities. "We were
used to build everything only a single time. To do things in
repetition, you get into a different way of thinking (...) you
need to think carefully whether the part is still for sale in a few
years (...) We evaluate all projects with stakeholders, which
results in adjustments and choices. You're constantly refining
and fine-tuning"(B9)
8 2009: Expanding market scope to
include emerging economies
ADAPTATION: Based on executed projects and
website requests, the market scope (customer
segments) is expanded toward emerging economies
such as countries from the Middle East, South America,
and Asia. "Our market scope has enlarged, now we are much
more active in the Middle East, such as in Turkey." (B1). "Did
Exhibits.nl bring new customers? Yes (...) such as parties from
South America; we are shipping exhibits to South America
now" (B9).

Episode Description
9 2010 (Spring): Ending the
partnership with the design agency
ADAPTATION: Bruns gradually learns from
experience to change the partnership with the design
agency because the agency has a decreasing impact
on value creation and retains a substantial portion of
revenues. This leads to dissolution of the partnership.
"The role of the design agency changed after a number of
years because only very few detailed designs were needed.
Their input was actually only with the website and the like"
(B3). "It was decided to just buy out [design agency]. We still
work with them in large projects [in the traditional business].
If there are new exhibits for Exhibits.nl (...) we now outsource
the design to them" (B1).
10 2011 (Spring): Appointing
commercial assistant for Exhibits.nl
ADAPTATION: From experience, Bruns learns
that to utilize the commercial potential of Exhibits.
nl, its commercial director needs additional support; a
commercial assistant is appointed (additional resource)
for better and quicker customer interaction (customer
relations). "The concept is (...): potential customers receive
information via the website (...) so you soon get requests for
information. During the day I had barely time for this, and I
often responded in the evening or at night; I gave an answer,
and that was it. Sometimes something got out of this, other
times not. Sometimes you had personal contact, but we
wanted a more constant factor for this, and also the fact that
we wanted to grow naturally. Anyway, to be able to produce
more" (B3).

Table 6. MiPlaza (Philips).
Episode Description
1 2004 (June): Research
support services for
micro, nano, and bio R&D
are identified as business
opportunity
CONCEPTUALIZATION: Opening up Philips R&D campus
to outside parties leads to seeing Philips' research support
services in a new light, as business opportunity (dubbed
MiPlaza), and identifying a value proposition, activities,
resources, and customers "We thought of things that could
make the campus a success and then we came up with MiPlaza
(...) it became obvious to [explicitly] open up our research services
to third parties" (P7) and revenues and costs "In 2004, 4% of
the revenues already came from parties outside Philips" (P1) "In
the future it could become harder to finance our base infrastructure,
this would be much easier if we shared this infrastructure with third
parties" (P7).
2 2004: Start collaboration with
equipment manufacturers
ADAPTATION: Based on ongoing operations, MiPlaza's
customer base is broadened, which triggers some of MiPlaza's
testing equipment suppliers to inform if MiPlaza is willing to
share user information: "We had different types of customers doing
different things and then suppliers become interested and want to be
part of that" (P3). This leads to new partnership agreements
between several equipment suppliers and MiPlaza, in which
Berends et al. 211
Episode Description
MiPlaza can use state of the art testing equipment against
reduces cost and the sharing of test results. These partnerships
reduce MiPlaza's equipment costs: "Equipment suppliers now
put in place equipment because a lot of companies are working
with it and that is interesting for them, so [the customer base]
becomes and asset" (P7). "Instead of buying equipment, you enter a
partnership" (P3).
3 2005: Appointment of
a business development
manager for MiPlaza
ADAPTATION: Based on growing operations: "The need for
research support services was growing by itself, we did not have to
do very intelligent things for that, people were just knocking on our
door." (P7) it is realized that MiPlaza is in need of an additional
resource for business development: "we needed someone to
think with us about organization, that we had proper invoices and
that everything had the brand `MiPlaza'. These kind of things."
(P7) Therefore a full-time business development manager is
appointed: "I approached [Business development manager] who got
on board" (P7). This appointment created a clearer customer
interface and sales channel: " [Business development manager]
became a central figure when dealing with new and potential
customers, to develop a uniform approach" (P3).
4 2005: Important customers
get involved in a steering
committee
ADAPTATION: Based on broadening operations, customer
relationships are strengthened by involving important
customers in the steering committee of one of MiPlaza's
departments. This committee decides on what equipment is
purchased and on ways of working. "From 2005 onwards also
some important [and new] external customers, such as Holst Centre
are members [of steering committee]. This committee decides on
what equipment has to be purchased and on ways of working" (P4).
5 2006: MiPlaza is formalized as
a separate division (sector)
within Philips
ADAPTATION: Due to the ongoing broadening of MiPlaza's
client base and new large customers, MiPlaza is increasingly
becoming more different than ordinary research groups that do
not serve outside customers. "Then [...] came as large customers,
before that we only had smaller clients. This made it all more serious.
For example contracting took more time and service reliability
became much more important (P4). This leads to the decision by
upper management to formalize MiPlaza as a separate division
within Philips and create two additional resources: a MiPlaza
general manager at Vice President level and a communication
manager:"In 2006 upper management decided to further broaden
our initial success and MiPlaza became a separate division" (P4) "A
Vice President is officially leading MiPlaza from Sep. 1, 2006." (P1)
"Next to [VP] a communication manager was installed because there
was a need for proper communication." (P2) This development also
has consequences for the revenue stream. From now on both
internal and external customers pay `fees for service'; earlier
`R&D cost allocations' were used for internal customers: "When
we became a separate division we started charging both internal and
external customers in the same way" (P3).

Episode Description
6 2006­2007: "One MiPlaza"
change program: Analysis
is executed and points
of attention for further
development are explicated
CONCEPTUALIZATION: The "One MiPlaza" change
program is initiated by the newly appointed Vice President to
strengthen the integration of the separate research departments
that are now part of the new division and further develop the
business. The program started with a "gap" analysis: based
on employee and customer interviews gaps were identified
between the current situation and the desired situation. Based
on this analysis, focus points for further development and
strengthening MiPlaza's value proposition become more
explicit: "Interviews and a survey with employees and customers (...)
resulted in identifying gaps [between MiPlaza's services and customer
demand] that had to be worked on." (P1): business acumen
(activities and resources), customer relationships, market
orientation (activities and resources) and the management
of IP (activities and resources): "People did not have a sense
for business and making profit, handling customer relationships was
difficult, they were not driven by market orientation, and managing IP
issues was a challenge" (P1).
7 2008: Training MiPlaza
researchers on IP
management
CREATION: Based on the early phases of the One
MiPlaza change program, MiPlaza researchers are trained in
IP management: "All employees got IP management training"
(P5) This creates new resources for MiPlaza and impacts
activities: "We have this framework for IP management that we
apply as much as possible. It supports our work because we all
use the same practices" (P9) and it also strengthens the value
proposition: "Customers see good IP management as important
and we have to take care of potential IP leakages; our employees
are trained for that" (P4).
8 2008: Introducing "process
house" and gaining ISO
certification
CREATION: The "One MiPlaza" analysis phase had
highlighted that there were little division-wide procedures
and much ad-hoc activities: "Everyone could do everything and
start with things whenever they wanted" (P1) To get a grip on
the business, a Business Excellence manager was appointed
and a "process house" was introduced which received
ISO certification at the end of 2008: "A Business Excellence
Manager was appointed in 2008." (P2) "The `process house' was
introduced in 2008 and gained ISO certification at the end of
that year" (P1). These new resources also strengthened the
MiPlaza value proposition: "ISO certification also increases
the value of services to our clients. Because you have ISO people
are assured that your processes are okay, because they are
monitored by an external institute." (P5) ISO certification
and the process house also had an influence on activities:
"Employees became responsible for describing and improving
processes" (P5).

Episode Description
9 2008: Installing business
creation team (BCT)
CREATION: The "One MiPlaza" analysis phase had
revealed that the management of customer relationships
and market orientation was not at the desirable level. The
aspiration to improve the commercial side of the business
leads to investments in additional resources which
strengthened customer relationship management: hiring two
sales managers and an experienced marketing manager. "There
was a need to move from an internally focused organization to a
commercial organization, for example increase our presence at
trade-fairs, that's why we recruited sales people. They had to take
over the commercial tasks of the researchers" (P3). "In 2008,
two sales managers and an experienced marketing manager were
hired" (P1).
10 2008: Developing market
segmentation
ADAPTATION: Initially, MiPlaza focused on areas that were
in the scope of Philips' business units, which had always been
their internal customers: "Based on our heritage, we focused on the
semiconductor and healthcare industries" (P3). Ongoing operations
lead to the realization that MiPlaza's research services are
also of interest for (potential) customers that operate outside
this scope such as the solar market. "We found out that thin
film analyses are also very useful in the solar domain" (P3). This
triggers the explicit refinement of customer segments and a
more focused use of sales channels: "Market segmentation and
developing focus teams started in 2008. This focused our visits to
trade-fairs" (P3).

Table 7. "Waste no More" (Van Gansewinkel).
Episode Description
1 2006: Reinterpretation
of existing activities
inspired by documentary
CONCEPTUALIZATION: A documentary on waste as "raw
materials" on Dutch television ("VPRO Tegenlicht") inspires a
reconceptualization of Van Gansewinkel's existing activities,
resources, and revenue stream. It was recognized that Van
Gansewinkel already recycled and sold recycled materials on a
small scale, but they now conceive this as value proposition
"At the core there already was something that related to recycling,
but through this external trigger, pretty much the documentary, we
realized that this could be our future business case." (V10). This
value proposition could be delivered to existing customers,
with whom they had existing relationships, via existing
distribution channels: "It was not the case that we just focused on
raw materials. We took into account with which customers we had a
good relationship, and who we saw at conferences" (V9).

Episode Description
2 2007 (May): Starting
collaboration with NGO
EPEA, which promotes
the cradle-to-cradle
(C2C) approach
CREATION: Van Gansewinkel contracts NGO EPEA
(Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency) as partner
which provides knowledge (resources) to further develop
recycling capabilities and to become a "cradle-to-cradle"
expert: "Our partnership with EPEA is broad but has a lot to do with
knowledge" (V13). The link with EPEA also strengthens the value
proposition because an increasing number of companies want
to certify C2C products with EPEA and Van Gansewinkel, as a
recycler, can facilitate closing the loop. "[Partnership] has clear
mutual benefits. EPEA deals with organizations that want to certify,
and they refer them to us to close the loop, and we promote the C2C
philosophy at our customers" (V3). Because EPEA refers potential
customers to Van Gansewinkel, the collaboration also creates a
new channel.
3 2007: First projects on
recycling
EXPERIMENTATION: Exploratory projects on reuse of
materials are executed as a proof of concept of the new BM
and value proposition. "The first project with Philips was just a
simple tray of recycled materials. It has cost us both a lot of money,
but it has been an investment in demonstrating that we can do it,
that it is possible, as the start of something much larger" (V4). In
these projects, Van Gansewinkel is working closer together
with customers than it ever did. "With Philips we worked together
very intensively" (V12). Therefore, executing these projects also
affects customer relationships.
4 2008: First cradle-to-
cradle project
EXPERIMENTATION: Representatives from Mosa, a tile
company, and Van Gansewinkel meet at a conference. From
the enthusiasm of both sides, a C2C project is born and
together they start business development experiments with the
collection and recycling of ceramics. This is a test case for Van
Gansewinkel to see what value they can bring in C2C projects
(value proposition). "Mosa was also one of the first projects
(...) we are still working on that. At the moment, Mosa is testing
all kinds of C2C tiles and is involved in `take-back' trials" (V12).
(Potential) customers participating in C2C projects, like Mosa,
are also seen as partners in the further development of the
C2C philosophy: "As partners, we [Mosa and Van Gansewinkel]
strengthen each other's market position; our common philosophy
appeals to a variety of companies." (Sales manager Van Gansewinkel
in annual report).
5 2009: Set-up of C2C
board, executive
committee, and
development team
ADAPTATION: Based on ongoing operations and an increase
in projects the need for control emerges. Therefore, it is
decided to develop a more formal structure, which structures
activities. "We had about 160 projects (...) and then the
problem becomes how to manage these. So very early we developed
a C2C development team which is a sort of structure..." (V13)
"[Coordination mechanisms] grew organically. We had the executive
committee (...) and the development team" (V9)

Episode Description
6 2009: Many employees
are sent to the C2C
academy in Hamburg
with EPEA and
"knowledge cafés" are
organized
CREATION: Based on BM conceptualization the plan is
developed and executed to send the company's top 200
employees to EPEA for training on C2C in 2009 en 2010. Some
also learned to give internal training on C2C. Although this
raises operating costs significantly, knowledge on C2C and
recycling (resources) is further developed Also "knowledge
cafes" are organized for internal knowledge sharing. "In 2009 our
CEO encouraged the top 200 to go to Hamburg to learn about the
C2C philosophy; 15 of them also give internal training sessions, so we
have a training structure in place (...) we really invested in training,
even in the midst of the financial crisis" (V12) "We do a lot of
`knowledge cafés. I think these are a good vehicle to share knowledge
and keep people enthusiastic" (V9)
7 2009: Introduction
of "waste no
more" as corporate
communication
CREATION: The slogan "waste no more" is developed by the
corporate communications department both to claim a position
in the market and to crystallize the new direction internally.
The development of this resource further explicates the value
proposition "We developed the pay off `waste no more' (...) to
claim our position in the market and to show internally the direction
we wanted to go" (V2)
8 2010: Market analysis is
done to guide further
development of the
business model
CONCEPTUALIZATION: An analysis of material markets
is done to determine a more focused BM based on high-quality
recycling and closing loops in particular material supply chains.
This results in the conceptualization of several customer
segments as focus areas "We started focusing on different
materials supply chains such as plastics."(V9) "This started in the
heads of people, and this was discussed by the C2C development
team." (V12), a sharper value proposition and an increased
focus on costs and revenues. "There was consensus that we had
to be able to develop material flows, otherwise it would be difficult
for Van Gansewinkel to develop a solid financial model" (V7) "now
we focus on 10 projects that must have a solid business case in
2014" (V4).
9 2010 (October): Start
new department
Materials, Concepts, and
Infrastructure (MCI)
CREATION: Partly based on the market analysis, several
support departments are regrouped under a new name (MCI),
thereby giving more attention to the identified customer
segments and restructuring activities and resources.
"In 2010 we started focusing on several topics, and MCI is the
organizational output of this" (V2). "[In 2010] we developed MCI
which combines several of our traditional departments (...) With MCI
we focus on the new way of thinking about waste (...) it includes
several people that are fully dedicated to C2C projects" (V12). "The
formation of MCI is the first significant structural organizational
change" (V10).
