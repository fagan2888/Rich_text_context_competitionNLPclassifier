Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in the United States:
Implications of Various Definitions for Abnormal
H. Gilbert Welch, Lisa M. Schwartz, Steven Woloshin
Background: The finding that some men with a normal
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (i.e., less than 4 ng/mL)
nonetheless have microscopic evidence of prostate cancer
has led to some suggestions that the threshold defining
abnormal should be lowered to 2.5 ng/mL. We examined the
effect of this lower threshold on the number of American
men who would be labeled abnormal by a single PSA test.
Methods: We obtained PSA data on a nationally representa-
tive sample of American men 40 years of age and older with
no history of prostate cancer and no current inflammation or
infection of the prostate gland (n = 1308) from the 2001­2002
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We
obtained data on the 10-year risk of prostate cancer death in
the pre-PSA era from DevCan, the National Cancer Insti-
tute's software to calculate the probability of dying of cancer.
Results: Based on NHANES data, approximately 1.5 million
American men aged 40 to 69 years have a PSA level over 4.0
ng/mL. Lowering the threshold to 2.5 ng/mL would label an
additional 1.8 million men as abnormal, if all men were
screened. For men aged 70 years or older, the corresponding
numbers are 1.5 and 1.2 million. The proportion of the popu-
lation affected by different thresholds would vary with age.
Among men in their 60s, for example, 17% have a PSA level
over 2.5 ng/mL, 5.7% have a PSA level over 4.0 ng/mL, and
1.7% have a PSA level over 10.0 ng/mL. For context, only
0.9% of men in their 60s are expected to die from prostate
cancer in the next 10 years. Conclusion: Lowering the PSA
threshold to 2.5 ng/mL would double the number of men
defined as abnormal, to up to 6 million. Until there is evi-
dence that screening is effective, increasing the number of
men recommended for prostate biopsy--and the number
potentially diagnosed and treated unnecessarily--would be
a mistake. [J Natl Cancer Inst 2005;97:1132­7]
Several studies have demonstrated that a substantial number
of men have microscopic evidence of prostate cancer despite
having a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level below the standard
threshold used to define abnormal, i.e., 4.0 ng/mL (1­3). These
findings have led some physicians to advocate a lower PSA
threshold of 2.5 ng/mL (4,5). A lower threshold inevitably means
that more men would be labeled as abnormal, have a prostate
biopsy, and be treated for prostate cancer. However, because clin-
ically insignificant disease (also known as pseudodisease) is a
well-known problem in prostate cancer (6), others are concerned
that a lower PSA threshold will lead to more overdiagnosis and
have urged caution in pursuing a diagnosis of prostate cancer in
men who have a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or lower (7).
Although some data on the number of men who would be
identified as abnormal with various PSA thresholds are available
from invitational studies of prostate cancer screening (8,9),
population-based data on the distribution of PSA levels among
men in the United States have not been previously available.

We use newly released data from the 2001­2002 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the distribu-
tion of PSA levels in American men to investigate how many
men would be labeled as having abnormal PSA levels if the
threshold were to change.
We first determined the distribution of PSA levels for screen-
eligible American men and the number of these men who would
be labeled abnormal using various PSA thresholds (assuming
that all such men were screened). To put these numbers in
perspective, we attempted to estimate the true burden of clini-
cally important disease using the risk of prostate cancer death.
METHODS
Distribution of PSA Levels
Data on the distribution of PSA levels for American men were
obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' most
recent NHANES (2001­2002 data release). These surveys, which
have been conducted periodically since the 1970s, involve house-
hold interviews and standardized medical examinations that
include a variety of blood tests (10). The sampling design, data
collection methods, and weighting approach of NHANES have
been described elsewhere (11,12). The 2001­2002 NHANES
data are based on a randomly selected, nationally representative
sample of approximately 11000 people of all ages. This survey
was the first NHANES to include a PSA test for men aged 40
years or older as part of the medical examination.
Figure 1 shows the selection process recommended by
NHANES that we used to identify a representative PSA screen-
eligible population of men aged 40 years or older (23). Men
who had a history of prostate cancer were excluded, as were
those who had an examination or condition that might spuri-
ously elevate PSA level (i.e., prostate biopsy or cystoscopy dur-
ing the previous month, rectal examination during the previous
week, or current inflammation or infection of the prostate). We
also excluded men who had missing data for any of these eligi-
bility criteria or for their PSA level. Our final sample included
1308 men.
10-year Risk of Prostate Cancer Death
Data on the risk of prostate cancer death for American men
were obtained by using DevCan 5.2 software from the National
Cancer Institute (13). DevCan allows users to calculate the age-
specific chance of developing or dying from specific cancers for
a given time frame. These probabilities are based on cancer inci-
dence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, mortality data
from the National Center for Health Statistics, and population
estimates from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. We chose a
10-year time frame to examine the risk of dying from prostate
cancer because it is an intermediate interval (i.e., somewhere
between an annual and a lifetime risk) during which annual
screening could plausibly affect clinical diagnosis and mortality.
We obtained the 10-year risk of death due to prostate cancer for
men at each year of age and then averaged these 10-year risks
within each decade of life. For example, to obtain the 10-year
risk of death due to prostate cancer for men in their 40s, we first
determined the 10-year risk of death for men at each year of age
(e.g., 10-year risk for a 40 year old, 10-year risk for a 41 year old,
and so on) and then averaged the 10-year risks for men aged 40
years, men aged 41 years, and so on through men aged 49 years.
Because prostate cancer mortality has declined somewhat
since the introduction of PSA screening, it is possible that some
of the decline is due to PSA screening itself. If so, 10-year risks
based on current mortality data would underestimate the 10-year
risks expected in the absence of screening. To avoid this problem,
we used prostate cancer mortality data from 1984 through 1986
(i.e., before the advent of PSA screening). In addition, because
the risk data are based on the entire U.S. population (a small
fraction of which already has clinically evident prostate cancer),
they may actually overstate the risk of death in the screen-eligible
population reported here.
Statistical Analysis
We examined results for five age groups: 40­49 years, 50­59
years, 60­69 years, 70­79 years, and 80 years or older. For each
age group, we first calculated the number and proportion of
men whose PSA level exceeded the following threshold values:
2.5 ng/mL, 4.0 ng/mL, 6.0 ng/mL, 8.0 ng/mL, and 10.0 ng/mL.
We then compared the number of men whose PSAlevel exceeded
each of those threshold values with the number of men who were
expected to die of prostate cancer in the next 10 years without
undergoing PSA testing.
To make national estimates from the NHANES sample, all
analyses incorporated the sampling variable (WTMEC2YR)
which weights the sample up to the 2000 census as well as ac-
counting for differential probability of selection across subjects
and nonresponse. The analyses also incorporated design effects
variables (variable names: SDMVPSU and SDMVSTRA) to
account for the survey's complex multistage sampling strategy
when calculating 95% confidence intervals. All analyses used the
SVY series of commands in STATA statistical software (version
8.0; College Station, TX).

RESULTS
Figure 2 illustrates the estimated distribution of PSA levels
among American men in each of five age groups, and Table 1
shows the estimated number of men in the general screen-eligible
population in each age group who would be labeled abnormal
using various PSA thresholds if all men were screened. Among
men typically thought of as being of screening age (i.e., 40­69
years old), approximately 1.5 million would have a PSA level
greater than 4.0 ng/mL. Lowering the threshold to 2.5 ng/mL
would label an additional 1.8 million men as abnormal. For men
aged 70 years or older, the corresponding numbers are approxi-
mately 1.5 million and 1.2 million.
Table 1 also shows the number of men who are expected to
die from prostate cancer. Among men aged 50­59 years, for ex-
ample, approximately 35000 are expected to die from prostate
cancer in the next 10 years. This number of men contrasts sharply
with the 1.5 million men aged 50­59 years who would be la-
beled abnormal using a PSA threshold of 2.5 ng/mL. For each
age group, even at the highest PSA threshold (i.e., 10 ng/mL),
considerably more men are labeled abnormal than are expected
to die from the disease in the next 10 years.
Figure 3 and Table 2 illustrate the effect of PSA threshold on
the proportion of screen-eligible men who, if screened, would
be labeled as abnormal. For example, among men aged 50­59
years, 10.7% have a PSA level greater than 2.5 ng/mL, 5.3%
have a PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL, and 1.6% have a PSA
level greater than 10.0 ng/mL. To put these proportions in
context, only 0.3% of men aged 50­59 years are expected to die
from prostate cancer in the next 10 years. Among men aged
60­69 years, 17% have a PSA level greater than 2.5 ng/mL,
5.7% have a PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL, and 1.7% have
a PSA level greater than 10.0 ng/mL, but only 0.9% of men in
this age group are expected to die from prostate cancer in
the next 10 years. Almost half of men age 70 years or older
have a PSA level greater than 2.5 ng/mL, yet even in this
age group, the 10-year risk of death from prostate cancer is less
than 3%.
DISCUSSION
The PSA test was developed as an assay for an immunologic
marker that corresponded well with clinical stage in patients
known to have prostate cancer (14) and was subsequently found
to be able to identify prostate cancer in men not known to have
the disease (15). However, PSA screening was widely adopted
in the United States before there was any evidence of its effec-
tiveness in reducing prostate cancer mortality. Although many
adjustments have been suggested to define abnormal (e.g., PSA
density, PSA velocity, age-specific PSA norms, free PSA) (16),
the PSA threshold used in the seminal article that advocated PSA
screening (15)--4.0 ng/mL--remains, for practical reasons, the
standard to define abnormal. This threshold value was selected
not on the basis of a randomized trial but arbitrarily (2).
Although there is still no evidence that screening reduces pros-
tate cancer mortality, there are now calls (4,5) to lower the PSA
threshold to 2.5 ng/mL simply because more prostate cancer
would be found.
Just because a lower PSA threshold allows more prostate
cancer to be detected does not mean it is a better threshold than
the current one. The logic behind the call for a PSA threshold

10-year risk of
prostate cancer death
of 2.5 ng/mL is that there are men who have PSA levels between
2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL who have prostate cancer. But the same logic
could be extended to argue that any PSA level is abnormal and
that all men should have a prostate biopsy, given the finding that
more than 10% of those with PSA levels less than 2.5 ng/mL
nonetheless have prostate cancer (1).
There are several limitations to our analysis. Our data are
only as good as our data sources. NHANES and DEVCAN are
among the most credible nationally representative sources for in-
formation on the distribution of laboratory tests and cancer mor-
tality. Nevertheless, both have missing data and may not be
perfect estimates. In addition, the PSA data from NHANES is
limited by the small number of younger men with elevated PSA
levels. To deal with this uncertainty, we provided confidence in-
tervals in Table 2. Nevertheless, these data make it possible to
examine the likely effect of lowering the PSA threshold.
If all men were screened using the current threshold of
4.0 ng/mL, 1.5 million American men aged 40 to 69 years would
be labeled abnormal. Lowering the PSA threshold to 2.5 ng/mL
would more than double this number, such that approximately
1.8 million additional men aged 40 to 69 years would be la-
beled abnormal and face negative consequences of the test
result (i.e., biopsy or a cycle of repeated testing and anxiety as
long as the uncertainty about whether or not they have prostate
cancer persists). If all 1.8 million men had a biopsy, about 1.35
million men would undergo the procedure unnecessarily (i.e.,
their PSA test results would be considered false positives). The
remaining men, approximately 450000, would be diagnosed
with prostate cancer (1). Whether the lower PSAthreshold would
have any benefit on morbidity or mortality is not known, but its
burden is clear. If all of these men underwent radical prostatec-
tomy, approximately 180000 men would be expected to be made
impotent, approximately 40000 men would be expected to have
at least moderate incontinence (17), and approximately 1000
men would be expected to die from the procedure alone (18).
The problem is that although it is easy to diagnose more prostate
cancer, it is not easy to know who has clinically important
disease.
The overdiagnosis of prostate cancer reflects the fact that the
cellular abnormality that pathologists call prostate cancer is far
1136 ARTICLES Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 97, No. 15, August 3, 2005
too prevalent to be consistently clinically important. How much
prostate cancer is found seems to be directly related to how hard
it is looked for. Consider the prostate biopsy process: because
generally there is no obvious lump to remove, urologists sample
cells from different portions of the organ. Historically, six needle
biopsy samples were taken; now, many urologists are advocat-
ing taking 12 or more biopsy samples--noting that the more
samples that are taken, the more cancer is found (19). Some
researchers have even advocated the use of "saturation biopsy"
(a procedure involving from 32 to 38 needle biopsy samples)
because this procedure has demonstrated that microscopic can-
cers can still be found in men who have had been cancer free on
three or more prior biopsy procedures (20). Furthermore, when
pathologists systematically searched the prostate glands removed
from older men who were not known to have the disease, they
found that at least half had microscopic evidence of prostate
cancer (21).
In the absence of data on the effectiveness of screening, we
believe that it would be inappropriate to select the PSA thresh-
old simply to maximize how much prostate cancer is found.
The choice of a threshold should be equally informed by how
many men would be drawn unnecessarily into the process of
prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. That is, the PSAthresh-
old should be selected to target the number of men who are
expected to develop clinically important disease. In other words,
given that the effectiveness of the PSA screening test is not
known, the threshold selected should not result in many more
men labeled abnormal than could conceivably benefit from
early detection.
To apply this principle, we considered the risk of prostate can-
cer death over 10 years--a time period during which annual PSA
screening could plausibly affect mortality. Because more than
two-thirds of men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in
the SEER data ultimately die of the disease (22), the risk of death
also captures most men who develop symptomatic metastatic
disease--a group of men who certainly warrant the label of hav-
ing "clinically important" disease. Using the 10-year risk of death
as the standard for clinically important disease, we found that
roughly 10 times more men had an abnormal PSA level using the
current PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL than would be expected to
die from the disease in the next 10 years. Our results, from a
population of screen-eligible men (i.e. those without symptoms
of prostate cancer), suggest that raising the threshold--perhaps
to 10 ng/mL--would identify a number of men that more closely
approximates the number at risk for prostate cancer death. Fur-
thermore, because screening always has benefits and harms, it is
possible that raising the PSA threshold would enhance the net
effect of PSA screening by identifying the people at highest risk
of clinically significant disease and thereby limiting the number
of healthy people harmed. Although it is possible that a higher
PSA threshold could cause some cases of clinically important
disease to be missed (some of which may benefit from earlier
therapy), it is incumbent on those who would argue for keeping
the current PSA threshold of 4 ng/mL to demonstrate that
finding such cases outweighs the inevitable harms of involving
millions of men in the screening process.
We recognize that many clinicians will find the suggestion of
higher PSA thresholds both radical and difficult to accept. Ide-
ally, randomized trials that test a variety of thresholds should be
performed to inform the choice of threshold. However, no such
trials are in progress. In the meantime, it does not make sense to
adopt a PSA threshold that causes the number of men identified
as abnormal to move yet further away from the number of men
who are destined to develop clinically important disease. We
believe that lowering the PSA threshold to 2.5 ng/mL would be
a mistake.
