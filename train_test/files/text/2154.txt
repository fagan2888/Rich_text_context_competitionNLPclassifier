Purpose: As Baby Boomers enter late life, rela-
tionships with family members gain importance. This
review article highlights two aspects of their intergen-
erational relationships: (a) caregiving for aging par-
ents and (b) interactions with adult children in the
context of changing marital dynamics. Design
and Methods: The researchers describe three
studies: (a) the Within Family Differences Study
(WFDS) of mothers aged 65­75 and their multiple
grown children (primarily Baby Boomers) ongoing
since 2001; (b) the Family Exchanges Study (FES) of
Baby Boomers aged 42­60, their spouses, parents,
and multiple grown children ongoing since 2008;
and (c) the Longitudinal Study of Generations (LSoG)
of 351 three-generation families started when the
Baby Boomers were teenagers in 1971, with inter-
views every 3­5 years from 1985 to 2005.
Results: These studies show that the Baby Boom-
ers in midlife navigate complex intergenerational
patterns. The WFDS finds aging parents differentiate
among Baby Boomer children in midlife, favoring
some more than others. The FES shows that the Baby
Boomers are typically more involved with their
children than with their aging parents; Boomers'
personal values, family members' needs, and personal
rewards shape decisions about support. The LSoG
documents how divorce and remarriage dampen
intergenerational obligations in some families. More-
over, loosening cultural norms have weakened family
bonds in general. Implications: Reviews of these
studies provide insights into how the Baby Boomers
may negotiate caregiving for aging parents as well
as the likelihood of family care they will receive when
their own health declines in the future.

The Baby Boom generation was born between
1946 and 1964; this large birth cohort brought sig-
nificant changes for American families. Beginning
nearly two centuries ago, fertility rates began to
drop in the Western world (Alwin, 2011), and
the Baby Boom represents an 18-year exception to
this pattern, with birth rates of more than 3.0
children per woman during this period. Of course,
historically, women gave birth often. In the 1700s,
American women averaged seven or eight live

births (Haines, 2008). But the endurance of the
Baby Boomers' family ties is exceptional. In 1700,
the infant mortality rate was 20%, deadly epi-
demics were common, and overall life expectancy
remained below the age of 40. Dramatic shifts in
life expectancy over the past century have precipi-
tated accompanying changes in family ties. Baby
Boomers in their mid-60s today are expected to live
anadditional19.9 yearsonaverageandtheiryounger
peers may live even longer (Arias, 2011). Moreover,
more than 85% of adults aged 40­50 years have a
living parent (Swartz, 2009). The longevity of the
Baby Boomers' relationships to siblings and to aging
parents is unprecedented. This review article
describes key issues in the Baby Boomers' long-
enduring family ties as they enter old age, particu-
larly their intergenerational ties.
A reciprocal interplay between Baby Boomers'
intergenerational ties and societal changes began
in early life and continues into late life. The Baby
Boomers' relationships with their parents shaped
cultural, educational, and economic experiences
throughout their childhood (Fingerman & Dolbin-
MacNab, 2006). In young adulthood, the Baby
Boomers encountered remarkably different social
circumstances than their parents did, including the
women's movement, the sexual revolution, rising
divorce rates, and enhanced educational opportu-
nities. Societal changes continue to shape their
family ties. Increased use of technologies and a poor
economy have led to disparities with their own
grown children. Moreover, during the past half cen-
tury, norms governing intergenerational relations
have weakened; as Baby Boomers enter late life, they
have limited societal guidance regarding their
responsibilities for older parents or for grown chil-
dren (Riley & Riley, 1994).
Two key features of the Baby Boomers' intergen-
erational ties are the focus of this review. First, the
Baby Boomers increasingly are in positions of provid-
ing care to aging parents, and they do so in the con-
text of their original family ties. Throughout history,
most humans have had siblings, but the Baby Boom-
ers typically experienced larger sibships than did ear-
lier or later cohorts over the last century. Moreover,
they are the first cohort to enter midlife with so many
sisters and brothers still alive. The implications of
these sibling ties for their relationships with their aging
parents and future parent care warrant consideration.
Second, Baby Boomers often find themselves of
exchanging support with multiple generations.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, scholars docu-
mented relatively few cases where middle-aged
adults were in a "sandwich generation" of simul-
taneously providing care for aging parents and
children younger than 15 years (Grundy & Henretta,
2006; Loomis & Booth, 1995). Indeed, data from
the Long-Term Care Study of 1994 (when the old-
est Baby Boomers were aged 48) revealed that only
9% of female primary caregivers and 6% of male
primary caregivers also had children younger than
15 years. However, today, many Baby Boomers
are torn between helping young adult children and
aging parents (Attias-Donfut & Wolff, 2000;
Fingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011). Their aging par-
ents incur chronic illnesses and disability, whereas
their grown children face demands from economic
downturns, prolonged education, and a slow transi-
tion to adulthood (Arnett, 2000). The Baby Boomers
step in to provide assistance.
These demands from generations above and
below are situated in relationships to romantic
partners and changing marital dynamics. The Baby
Boomers experienced greater acceptance of non-
marital romantic liaisons, divorce, remarriage, and
cohabitation than was the case historically. Thus,
they often confront complex emotional, legal, or
financial demands from former romantic ties,
cohabitating partners, and peripheral relatives
(e.g., former in-laws or stepchildren). We consider
the implications of romantic relationships for the
Baby Boomers' ties to their parents and children as
they enter late life.
The researchers take two perspectives in
addressing these issues, they consider: (a) the ways
in which Baby Boomers' ties are prototypical of
family relationships in general (e.g., importance of
intergenerational ties in late life) and (b) unique
features that shape the Baby Boomers' family ties
as a cohort (e.g., increased life expectancy and
social vicissitudes). The point of this article is not
to provide a definitive review of Baby Boomers'
parent­child relations. Rather, the researchers
describe key issues and three major studies of
Boomers' families to illuminate these issues.
Multiple Siblings and Parent Care: The Within
Family Differences Study
As they traverse midlife and begin to enter late
life, Baby Boomer siblings typically confront their
parents' present or future needs for care. One pos-
sible consequence of the Baby Boomers' large
sibships is a high degree of differentiation among
parent­child dyads within families in adulthood.
Some siblings may get along better with parents,
Vol. 52, No. 2, 2012 201
some receive more from parents, and some may
give more back. A key question as they enter late
life is which children in the family will provide
parental care? Understanding whether and why
parents differentiate among Baby Boomer siblings
is a first step in answering this question.
Sibling differentiation is not new to the Baby
Boomers in late life. A substantial body of work has
demonstrated that parents' relationships with their
offspring differ considerably within the same family
throughout childhood and adolescence (Suitor,
Sechrist, Plikuhn, Pardo, & Pillemer, 2008), estab-
lishing patterns that might continue into adulthood.
However, it is plausible that parents cease to engage
in differentiation by the time the children reach mid-
life. The Baby Boomers separated from their parents
in young adulthood both physically (by moving out of
parental homes) and psychologically (by establishing
autonomy), leaving fewer opportunities for parents
to draw contrasts among their children.
Within Family Differences Study Design
The Within Family Differences Study (WFDS)
was designed to explore these alternative scenarios
in siblings' relationships with their parents. The
WFDS asks two key questions about the Baby
Boomers: (a) Do aging parents differentiate among
Baby Boomer siblings and, if so, (b) does such dif-
ferentiation matter to the siblings involved? More-
over, this study is well suited to address questions
regarding the parents' future caregiving.
The WFDS began in 2001 with the selection of
566 mothers aged 65­75 years with two or more
living children. At the end of each interview, the
mothers were asked to provide contact informa-
tion for their children. Approximately 63% of the
mothers agreed to provide information, and
approximately 70% of the children agreed to par-
ticipate. Telephone interviews were completed
with at least one child in 300 families, resulting in
a sample of 773 adult children. One hundred
twenty-nine fathers also participated.
Does Differentiation Exist in Baby Boomer Families?
The WFDS asked parents about relationships
with their middle-aged children across a range of
dimensions. Analyses revealed that most parents
differentiated among their offspring across mul-
tiple relational domains, including closeness,
confiding, preferences for care, and instrumental
and emotional support (Pillemer & Suitor, 2006;
Suitor, Pillemer, & Sechrist, 2006). For example,
among mothers, 72% named a child whom they
would prefer to care for them in times of illness or
disability, 79% named a child to whom they would
turn first in a crisis, 78% named a child to whom they
would talk first when facing a personal problem, and
64% named a child to whom they were most emo-
tionally close (Suitor & Pillemer, 2007). Furthermore,
more than three quarters of the mothers differentiated
among their children in providing emotional and
instrumental support (Suitor et al., 2006).
Although one might expect these patterns to
differ by gender or race of parent, this was not the
case. Percentages of mothers and fathers who dif-
ferentiated among their children were very similar
(Suitor & Pillemer, in press); likewise, Black and
White mothers were almost equally like to differ-
entiate among their children (Suitor, Sechrist, &
Pillemer, 2007a, 2007b).
Moreover, it was surprising that the adult children
were relatively accurate in reporting whether their
mothers currently differentiated among them (Suitor,
Sechrist, Steinhour, & Pillemer, 2006). However,
only about half of the adult children correctly identi-
fied which offspring the mothers favored.
Why Does Differentiation Occur and Does it
Matter?
Although differentiation in young families
reflects both parents' and children's or teenagers'
circumstances and characteristics, differentiation
when children are adults is fueled primarily by
characteristics of the offspring (Suitor et al.,
2007a). In particular, parents are substantially
more likely to favor daughters; children who share
their values and with whom they have a history of
supportive exchanges; and, in the case of closeness,
last-born children (Pillemer & Suitor, 2006; Suitor &
Pillemer, 2006). In contrast, parents' characteris-
tics play no role in when differentiation occurs or
which children are favored (Suitor et al., 2007a).
The implications of this differentiation were
evident with regard to offspring's well-being. WFDS
analyses showed that parental differentiation has
a major impact on adult children. When children
perceived their mothers as differentiating among
offspring or recall mothers "playing favorites" in
childhood, they reported more problematic relation-
ships with their siblings and higher depressive symp-
toms (Pillemer, Suitor, Pardo, & Henderson, 2010;
Suitor et al., 2009). The question remains as to
whether differentiation matters for parents as well.

Differentiation and Parental Caregiving in Late Life
There is a reason to expect that parental favorit-
ism will play a role in caregiving as parents age
and require greater assistance. The WFDS findings
suggest that expectations regarding care are estab-
lished long before parents are in need of such assis-
tance. In fact, the study found that more than three
quarters of the mothers in the WFDS named a spe-
cific child as the one most likely to care for them
when they became ill or disabled (Pillemer &
Suitor, 2006). Mothers typically expected that this
role would be filled by daughters and by children
who shared their values, lived a short distance
away, had provided support in the past year, and to
whom they felt high levels of emotional closeness.
Surprisingly, indicators of a child's availability--
including children's competing marital or parental
roles and responsibilities, education, or children's
problems--were not related to which child the
mother viewed as the likely caregiver.
These results suggest that mothers are heavily
influenced in their preferences and expectations
regarding their future caregiver by factors that rep-
resent comfort, trust, and reliability in interpersonal
relations such as gender and attitudinal similarity,
emotional closeness, and a history of having been
provided support by the child in the past. They also
call into question the importance of instrumental
and contextual factors, including competing family
roles or serious life problems that might appear to
make a child a less appropriate caregiver.
Such clear expectations regarding caregiving are
likely to have consequences when assistance
becomes necessary. Theory and research suggest
that consistency between expectations for care and
actual patterns of care will have a major impact on
outcomes, including psychological well-being of
both parents and children. This pattern may be
especially important in the case of family care-
givers. Assuming the role of family caregiver to an
impaired older person represents a major transi-
tion that typically has consequences for the care-
giver's physical, mental, and social well-being
(Pavalko, 2011); day-to-day demands are both
highly stressful and unfamiliar to most individuals
before assuming this position themselves (Gaugler,
Mendiondo, Smith, & Schmitt, 2003).
Specific expectations regarding which the child
will become the primary caregiver in the family
also introduce the possibility of violated expec-
tations, which have been shown to produce psy-
chological distress and tension in the relationship
(MacDermid, Huston, & McHale, 1990). For Baby
Boomers and their parents, violations of expecta-
tions may create anxiety on the part of parents and
conflict among siblings as well. These issues may be
further confounded if the Baby Boomer simulta-
neously is supporting grown children.
Interactions with Grown Children: The Family
Exchanges Study
The Baby Boomers also engage in support
exchanges with generations below as well as from
above; many Baby Boomers find themselves jug-
gling help to grown children as well as aging par-
ents. Moreover, Baby Boomers pivot between not
just two generational rungs, but multiple parents
and grown children on each rung. The Baby Boom-
ers have received assistance from their parents
throughout their life and many continue to do so in
midlife (Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Notwithstanding,
as the Baby Boomers enter late life, they face greater
demands from aging parents confronting health
declines and grown children experiencing economic
difficulties. Thus, a second key question as the
Baby Boomers enter late life is when and why they
provide assistance to their grown children and
when and why they funnel aid to parents?
Consistent with prior cohorts, the Baby Boomers
typically value relationships with their grown chil-
dren more than relationships with their parents
(Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson, 2005). Yet, the cir-
cumstances of their relationships are distinct when
compared with prior cohorts. The Baby Boomers'
parents have survived longer with chronic diseases
hitting later than in the past (Schoeni, Freedman, &
Martin, 2008). Their children have encountered
economic downturns, high demands for education,
and uncertainties in finding a stable mate (Fursten-
berg, 2010). Both generations incur needs that draw
on the Baby Boomers. The Family Exchanges Study
(FES) was designed to examine Baby Boomers'
interactions with multiple generational partners.
The FES Design
The FES included families consisting of middle-
aged Baby Boomers (n = 633), their spouses (i.e.,
other parent of offspring, n = 197), up to three
grown offspring (n = 592), and each living parent
(n = 337; total N = 1,759). Heavy recruiting in
high-density minority neighborhoods yielded a
sample that was 36% minority, particularly African
American.
Vol. 52, No. 2, 2012 203
FES involved succinct questions in computer-
assisted telephone interviews to garner participants'
perceptions of each family member. Middle-aged
Baby Boomers provided information about each
grown child (n = 1,384) and living parent (n =
860), regardless of whether those family members
participated. Participating spouses (n = 197), grown
children (n = 592), and parents (n = 337) com-
pleted similar surveys, providing a rich multiparty
portrait of family life.
The FES applied theories of social support
(Antonucci, 2001) to assess exchanges of advice,
information, emotional support, technical help, and
companionship as well as material and practical
help (Fingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011). The study also
assessed contextual factors such as demographic
characteristics (e.g., education, race), relationship
qualities, and needs (e.g., disability, student status).
The Scope of Intergenerational Support
In FES, most Baby Boomers' intergenerational rela-
tionships were thriving. As expected, most Boomers
reported frequent contact and exchanges of support
with both parents and grown children. Middle-aged
Baby Boomers offered each child a listening ear and
emotional support more than once a week, advice once
a month, and practical and financial assistance from
monthly to several times a year on average (Fingerman,
Miller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009). Baby Boomers were
also involved in support of parents, particularly when
parents incurred crises or disabilities that required
help (Fingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011; Fingerman,
VanderDrifts, Dotterer, Birditt, & Zarit, 2011).
These patterns are not surprising; intergenera-
tional support transcends the Baby Boomer cohort
and is common across history and cultural groups.
Yet, U.S. Baby Boomers are much more involved
with their own grown children than their parents
were with them. This trend began in childhood. A
national study of time use conducted from 1965
to 1998 revealed parents spent increasingly more
time engaging with children from 1975 to 1998,
when the Baby Boomers were likely to be raising
young children (the oldest Baby Boomers were
aged 29 in 1975 and the youngest Baby Boomers
were aged 34 in 1998; Sayer, Bianchi, & Robinson,
2004). Moreover, studies of involvement with
grown children reveal similar findings. Many of
the Baby Boomers' children entered young adult-
hood in the early 2000s. Comparing data from the
2000s with data from the 1980s and 1990s, young
adults report more frequent contact, receive more
frequent support, and share more similar values
with their parents than was the case in the prior
decades (Bengtson, Biblarz, & Roberts, 2002;
Fingerman, Cheng, Tighe, Birditt, & Zarit, in
press). Data from the National Survey of Families
and Households collected in 1988 revealed that
fewer than half (46%) of parents gave advice to a
grown child in the past month and only 31% pro-
vided any child practical assistance (Eggebeen, 1992).
By contrast, in FES in 2008, 89% of parents gave
advice to at least one child every month and 69%
gave practical support (Fingerman et al., in press).
Increased parental involvement may be benefi-
cial to Baby Boomers and their children. Educa-
tors and popular media lament "helicopter
parents" who hover over their grown children.
But complex economic and social demands make
it difficult for the Baby Boomers' children to gain
a foothold in adulthood (Furstenberg, 2010) and
parents may assist in these processes. In FES, more
than 20% of grown children received multiple
forms of support from Baby Boomer parents sev-
eral times a week; more importantly, the grown
children reported better adjustment and well-being
from receiving such support (Fingerman, Cheng,
et al., 2011).
Differentiation across Generations
Just as their parents differentiate among the
Baby Boomers, similarly, the Baby Boomers do
not support each child or parent comparably. The
multidimensional intergenerational support model
addresses factors underlying the Baby Boomers'
decisions to help each grown child or aging parent
(Birditt, & Fingerman, in press; Fingerman &
Birditt, 2011; Fingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011).
Baby Boomers make decisions about whether
to help aging parents or grown children based on
interrelated issues: resources they have, demands
they face from multiple family members, each fam-
ily member's needs, and the Boomers' own sense
of reward from helping a given family member.
The role of resources warrants particular con-
sideration. The Baby Boomers are heterogeneous
economically and their ability to provide support
clearly depends on what they have. Economic
background and current conditions shape what
Baby Boomers provide their grown children. Well-
off parents may invest in their children's educa-
tion. By contrast, less well-off parents may assist
children who are unemployed or have jobs with
low wages, changing hours, and few benefits.
The Gerontologist
204
Similarly, needs vary by economic background;
poorer Baby Boomers face greater demands from
family members. Under increasing family demands,
Baby Boomers often provide more time, effort,
and money than when such demands are less
(Fingerman et al., 2009; Lee, Zarit, Rovine, Birditt, &
Fingerman, 2011). Grundy and Henretta (2006)
described resource expansion when individuals
stretch time and material resources to meet many
family members' needs.
A counter aspect of this model involves dimin-
ishing receipt of support. In FES, controlling for
economic background, Baby Boomers with a
greater number of children gave more support
collectively to their children, but any given child
received less support across a variety of domains
(e.g., financial, practical, emotional; Fingerman
et al., 2009). Similarly, married couples with a
greater number of living parents expended more
time and energy helping parents, but each parent
received less support (Lee et al., 2011). On aver-
age, however, Baby Boomers have fewer children
than their parents did, and many Baby Boomers
have sufficient resources to provide support. Thus,
a low balance of demands to resources may explain
many Boomers' high involvement with their children.
Moreover, Baby Boomers rally around a variety
of family needs: (a) crises, (b) ongoing problems,
(c) everyday needs, and (d) future success. Prior
research has shown that middle-aged adults
respond to aging parents' health problems with
direct aid (Silverstein, Gans, & Yang, 2006). Simi-
larly, children who are least well off in a family
typically receive the most support (Attias-Donfut &
Wolff, 2000). But, in addition, to support in
response to crises, the Baby Boomers acknowledge
common everyday needs with support such as
babysitting, running an errand, or offering advice
to solve a problem, particularly for their grown
children (Fingerman et al., in press).
Baby Boomers also allocate resources based on
personal values. A study comparing intergenera-
tional African American and White families attests
to this premise (Fingerman, VanderDrift, et al.,
2011). African American Baby Boomers gave more
frequent support of all types to their aging parents
than White Baby Boomers did, but this difference
was not due to the parents' disability or needs.
Instead, beliefs that one should help parents and
perceived rewards of helping parents explained the
racial difference.
Finally, the Baby Boomers may consider their
children as their legacy. In FES, the Baby Boomers
helped children who had good relationships with
them and whom they found it rewarding to help
(Fingerman et al., in press). These Boomer parents
also provided support to specific children they
viewed as potentially successful (Fingerman et al.,
2009). Even in their generosity, Baby Boomers may
be less interdependent and more individual ori-
ented; they give because it makes them feel good.
Intergenerational Support as the Baby Boomers
Grow Older
As the Baby Boomers incur disability and other
declines, the obvious question is who will attend to
their needs? Their parents have served as a source
of support throughout their lives. As they deal
with the loss of their parents, Baby Boomers may
increasingly turn to their own children.
Frequent involvement with grown children
bodes well for a majority of the Baby Boomers.
Prior studies have found children typically support
aging parents if they received support in young
adulthood (Silverstein, Conroy, Wang, Giarrusso, &
Bengtson, 2002). Nonetheless, a proportion of
Baby Boomers may languish in late life due to a
lack of connection to their grown children. Changes
in romantic patterns and marital disruptions may
relegate some Baby Boomers (particularly men) to
receive diminished support from grown children in
late life.
Marital Transitions and Intergenerational Ties: The
Longitudinal Study of Generations
Romantic ties often serve as a platform for ties
to grown children, particularly for fathers. Baby
Boomers have been the first generation to bear the
brunt of the divorce revolution and its aftermath.
Three explanations suggest that Baby Boomers
who are not married may be at heightened risk for
lack of support from grown children in late life,
these factors include (a) a diminished sense of obli-
gation, (b) poorer emotional bonds, and (c) a lack
of parental investment in the child earlier in life.
Thus, a final question regarding the Baby Boomers
in late life is will the children and stepchildren of
the divorce revolution provide care for their older
parents?
In general, weakening norms of family obli-
gation over the past half century may lessen the
likelihood that Baby Boomers will receive support
from grown children. This is particularly the
case for nonmarried Boomers. Research suggests
Vol. 52, No. 2, 2012 205
children of divorce feel less filial obligation to
assist older family members than those who have
not experienced a marital disruption (Ganong &
Coleman, 1999).
Furthermore, filial support available to older
parents has its roots in early family experiences
involving reciprocity and attachment. The princi-
ple of reciprocity implies that children who received
time and financial investments from parents in
early life will reciprocate, sometimes decades later,
by providing parents social support and instru-
mental care (Kohli, 2005). An attachment perspec-
tive posits that close emotional bonds forged with
parents early in life promote strong and altruistic
tendencies in adult children (Silverstein et al.,
2002). Divorce and remarriage appear to compro-
mise both reciprocity and attachment mechanisms
for securing informal eldercare by disrupting par-
ents' early investments in children and compromis-
ing secure intergenerational bonds (Lin, 2008).
The Longitudinal Study of Generations
The task of understanding such family dynam-
ics from a cross-cohort perspective is made possible
by the Longitudinal Study of Generations (LSOG),
a study spanning four decades. The LSOG began
in 1971 as a cross-sectional study of 2,044 individ-
uals nested within 351 three-generation families.
The sample was derived via a multistage stratified
random selection of grandfathers enrolled in a
large southern California HMO and their descen-
dants. Each family lineage consisted of older G1
grandfathers, middle-aged G2 children, and late
adolescent G3 grandchildren. Spouses of family
members in each generation were also surveyed.
Beginning in 1985, follow-up surveys were admin-
istered every 3­5 years until 2005, and a fourth
generation was added in 1991.
The LSOG is unique because it followed indi-
viduals in multiple linked generations over a period
of history when many social changes occurred.
Two important features of the LSOG shed light on
the Baby Boomers: (a) the capacity to compare
Baby Boomers with other generations when each is
at the same stage of life but experiencing different
sociohistorical conditions and (b) the ability to
track Baby Boom respondents from when they
were as young as 16 years to late middle age.
Caring for Parents
Research from the LSOG has focused on the
role of early family conditions that predispose
adult children to provide support to older parents.
Parrott and Bengtson (1999) found that intergen-
erational relationships with higher levels of affec-
tion were more likely to later be characterized by
reciprocal exchanges of support between the gen-
erations. By contrast, lessened affection may be
associated with diminished sense of obligation to
provide parental care. Schmeeckle, Giarrusso,
Feng, & Bengtson (2006) found that current and
former stepparents were less likely to be perceived
by their stepchildren as parent-like figures because
the affective quality of their earlier relationships
was poorer compared with parent­child relation-
ships in intact families.
LSoG data have also revealed that parental vul-
nerability tends to activate earlier held filial expec-
tations and feelings of attachment into supportive
behavior. Silverstein and colleagues (2002) found
that middle-aged children who had emotionally
closer relations with their mothers as adolescents
were more likely to provide support three decades
later when their mothers experienced severe func-
tional impairments.
Similarly, familistic values prospectively pre-
dicted the support children provided, but only when
triggered by parents' frailty as manifested by poor
functional health and widowhood (Silverstein et al.,
2006). In this sense, filial norms and attachment
are forms of social capital that may remain latent
for decades until action is required (Silverstein &
Conroy, 2009), and marital disruption may result
in a loss of such capital.
It is important to note that changes in norms of
obligation are widespread, perhaps linked to
changing marital patterns. Silverstein and Giarrusso
(2011) applied a generational-sequential design--
where G3 (children) and G2 (parents) were
matched at the same chronological age and con-
trasted across historical periods 30 years apart--to
study how the strength of emotional bonds between
middle-aged children and their older mothers and
fathers changed across adjacent generations. The
authors found that G3 and G2 relationships were
weaker than G2 and G1 relationships when the
child generation in each dyad averaged about
45 years of age. This weakening was partially
explained by the increased prevalence of marital
disruption and steprelations, but it was mostly
explained by a decline in the strength of familistic
values in successive generations.
Furthermore, LSOG data have shown that
the strength of parent-care norms has weakened
between the 1970s and 1990s (Gans & Silverstein,
The Gerontologist
206
2006),whereasvaluesofindividualismhavestrength-
ened over the same historical period (Roberts &
Bengtson, 1999). Cross-national data support this
finding as well. A large multigeneration study in
the Netherlands found that middle-aged Dutch
adults were even less likely to endorse feelings of
obligation to help parents than were middle-aged
American adults (Cooney & Dykstra, 2011). Thus,
U.S. Baby Boomers are not alone in experiencing
diminished values for family.
Aging Baby Boomers in the Context of Marital
Disruption
Taken together, LSOG studies have offered evi-
dence that poor early parent­child relationships
may have adverse implications for future caregiv-
ing roles in complex families where intergenera-
tional bonds are notably weaker. These trends are
linked to marital instability and family disruption
and portend greater atomization in the family, with
consequences for the support and care the current
cohort of adult children will provide to their divorced
Baby Boom parents and stepparents.
Evidence from the LSOG suggests filial obliga-
tions and attachment--precisely those aspects of
intergenerational relationships that are compro-
mised in divorced and stepfamilies--are important
motivators of social support to older parents.
Were we to prognosticate based on the LSOG and
accumulated evidence, we would be less than san-
guine about intergenerational care available to
Baby Boom parents as they grow older, particu-
larly fathers whose relationships with adult chil-
dren are detached due to divorce and remarriage
(Silverstein, Bengtson, & Lawton, 1997). Some of
these fathers may remarry, however, and benefit
from care provided by a new, and possibly younger,
spouse.
Yet, adaptation to new realities may blunt the
impact of family change. The support portfolio of
older adults may actually widen with the prolifera-
tion of kin ties that result from multiple divorces
and remarriages (Riley & Riley, 1994). Moreover,
personal values may dictate patterns of support
more than norms and obligations among the Baby
Boomers and their progeny. Thus, gerontologists
might focus on within family differences and
compare biological and stepchildren in their filial
commitment (Pillemer & Suitor, 2006) and track
support Baby Boomers receive as they advance to
an age when the true impact of the divorce revolu-
tion will be discernable.
Implications of the Baby Boomers' Ties to Parents
and Children for the Future
Although the demise of the American family
has been lamented throughout the Baby Boom-
ers' lives, most Baby Boomers are actively
involved with members of generations above and
below them. Nonetheless, as these three studies
indicate, significant societal changes have
resulted in more individualized relationship
patterns and weakening norms regarding what
is expected from family members. As the Baby
Boomers enter the final decades of life, they are
likely to experience: (a) caregiving for their par-
ents; (b) losses of parents, siblings, and even chil-
dren; and (c) eventual needs for care themselves.
From a practical perspective, each of these issues
presents complexities.
With regard to caregiving, research has docu-
mented the effectiveness of a family meeting sup-
plementing individual counseling for caregivers
of older adults suffering from dementia (Zarit &
Femia, 2008). For the Baby Boomers, a key issue is
who to invite to such a meeting. Both the changing
dynamics of marriage and the longevity of sibling
ties provide an array of individuals who could be
involved in care. Beyond legal aspects of medical
decisions, caregiving will need to counterbalance
inclusiveness with effectiveness. The WFDS sug-
gests individuals remain sensitive to being less
favored than other family members. Thus, exclu-
sion from parental or stepparental care may have
deleterious effects on well-being and self-esteem,
and this possibility should be considered in care
planning.
Although demands of raising young children
have not typically conflicted with parental care
(Grundy & Henretta, 2006; Loomis & Booth,
1995), these patterns may change for a subset of
the youngest Baby Boomers or the oldest Baby
Boomers' own children in the future. Since the
early 1990s, the number of women giving birth
after age 35 has risen (47.1 per 1,000 women) as
has the number of women older than 40 years who
have given birth (1.5 births per 1,000 women;
Hamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2006; National
Health Statistics, 1997). Delayed childbearing
increases the likelihood of facing concurrent
demands from both generations for intense care.
Due to the large sibships typical of the Baby Boom,
however, Boomers who had children late may have
siblings who are available to care for their own
parents. The proportion of women in this age
Vol. 52, No. 2, 2012 207
range is also still relatively small, but nonetheless,
this trend suggests that a subset of Baby Boomers
may require care from children in the throws of
raising children of their own.
The FES and LSOG also document the need to
consider the role of personal values in the experi-
ences of providing support. The FES found that
Baby Boomers are more motivated to provide care
when they find doing so to be personally reward-
ing. Some Baby Boomers who find providing care
unpleasant may favor the idea of formal or institu-
tional care for parents (Zarit & Femia, 2008).
Indeed, the 1990s already saw increasing trends
toward use of paid care and decreasing informal
family care, and these trends may persist as the
Baby Boomers care for their parents (Spillman &
Pezzin, 2000). Thus, interventions and policies
will be most effective when acknowledging many
views on the best means of caring for older adults.
The next few decades will involve loss of loved
ones for Baby Boomers. Many Baby Boomers have
already lost a parent, but nearly all Baby Boomers
will be orphaned in the upcoming decades. Inheri-
tance among siblings is typically equitable, but
prior inequities in transfers when the parents were
alive (McGarry & Schoeni, 1997) may resurface and
generate conflict among siblings. Workplace bereave-
ment policies also may be challenged due to marital
dynamics as Baby Boomers and their children
encounter deaths of stepparents, parents, ex-in-laws,
and other family members in the older generation.
Finally, in coming decades, Baby Boomers them-
selves will incur disability and require care. The
majority of Baby Boomer parents are actively
involved with at least one grown child on a weekly
or even daily basis (Fingerman et al., in press).
Although norms and perceived obligation to
support family members have weakened (Gans &
Silverstein, 2006), such intensive involvement
bodes well, based on LSOG data showing endurance
of strong attachments and reciprocity (Silverstein
et al., 2002). Many Baby Boomers may reap the ben-
efits of reciprocity when they themselves are old.
Nonetheless, aside from family structure changes
that involve limited assistance from stepchildren,
other conditions may constrain the Baby Boomers'
children from assisting them. Most grown children
benefit from parental involvement (Fingerman,
Cheng, et al., 2011), but for some grown children,
parental overinvolvement in early adulthood may
limit acquisition of skills to provide care in return.
Baby Boomers' children also are likely to be single
parents; nearly, 4 in 10 births in the United States
in 2007 were to unmarried women (Ventura, 2009).
Similarly, if the weakened economy persists, some of
the Baby Boomers' children may be struggling finan-
cially, working in unstable jobs, managing multiple
stressors in their own lives, and unable to allocate
time necessary to provide care consistently.
The Baby Boomers have lived through and
shaped societal changes that define the nature of
intergenerational ties in the 21st century. As
they enter later life, they are likely to increas-
ingly value their family ties. Yet, the Baby Boom-
ers are a unique cohort and their approach to
these family ties may define new patterns for future
generations.
