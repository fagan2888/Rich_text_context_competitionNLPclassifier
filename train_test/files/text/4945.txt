How the Religious Cleavages of Civil Society
Shape National Identity
Annette Schnabel1 and Mikael Hjerm2
Abstract
This article focuses on religion and the embeddedness in civil society. We examine the relationship between religion and
national identity (ethnic and civic). Our findings show that individual religiosity continues to play an important role in
sustaining both forms of national identity. In addition to other studies, we examine the relationship between religion as a
societal phenomenon and individual national identity and find the following: The stronger the relationship between state
and religion, the stronger the ethnic identity; the more the religious homogeneity, the stronger the ethnic identity; and
there is no relationship between aggregated degree of religious organizations and identity. We conclude that religion
continues to play a major role in the making of civil society, but the specific circumstances vary according to the religious
representation. In other words, religion can both make and unmake national identity.

The associational life of civil society is the actual ground where
all versions of the good are worked out and tested . . . and
proven to be partial, incomplete, ultimately unsatisfying. It
can't be the case that living on this ground is good-in-itself;
there isn't any other place to live. What is true is that the
quality of our political and economic activity and of our
national culture is intimately connected to the strength and
vitality of our associations. Ideally, civil society is a setting of
settings: all are included, none is preferred.

Religion as a Way of Understanding Civil
Society
For a long time, the sociology of religion has suggested, on
one hand, that religion supports social cohesion through
shared symbols, rituals, norms, and networks (Fukuyama,
2001; Putnam, 1993, 1995) and that it has the power to
transcend boundaries constituted by factors such as ethnic
origin, gender, or age (Beck, 2008, p. 75), while on the
other hand, it tends to be exclusive to those who are not part
of the dominant congregation(s) (Bohn & Hahn, 2002;
Gross & Ziebertz, 2010; Yuval-Davis, 2010).
We argue that religion--despite a longstanding
discussion on the secularization of European societies--still
is a constituent factor shaping affiliations as well as
cleavages within European civil societies through creating
and sustaining national identity. We examine religion as a
multilevel phenomenon that comprises individual
religiousness but is also embedded in the institutional and
cultural setting of countries. While on the individual level,
religiosity still effects feelings of affiliation to larger
communities, religion as longstanding shared belief systems
is inscribed into political institutions, cultural frameworks
and social inequalities on the country level (e.g., Mau,
2002; Rokkan, 2000; Spohn, 2009). As a structural factor,
religion influences individual perceptions, attitudes and
actions.
In this article, we are interested in how religion on
different societal levels affects individual feelings of
national identity. More precisely, we want to know whether
and how religion especially as a societal phenomenon
(state­religion relationship, religious homogeneity, and
aggregate membership in religious organizations) affects
civic and ethnic national identity on the individual level.
We are interested in how religious institutions matter for
individual feelings of affiliation to a larger (national)
community.
Social Cohesion, Religion, and National
Identity--A Close but Not Too Close
Relationship
The article's question gains its relevance mainly from the
sociology of religion and from national identity research. So
far, both strands have generated a large body of literature

and established a longstanding tradition in focusing on
societal inclusion and exclusion as factors in the social
cohesion of civil societies.
When it comes to social cohesion, the theory of civil
societies draws attention to two main aspects of modern
democratic societies. First, civil societies are often seen as
providers of important conditions for civic engagement and
the social space to articulate, negotiate, and organize the
interests of citizens. In so doing, they help to maintain and
legitimize democracy and redistributive governmental
policies (e.g., Putnam, 1995). Civil societies inhere this
capacity by their ability to generate and distribute social
capital including trust, the willingness to contribute to the
common good, and the morale of reciprocity on the
individual level (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1993, 1995).
Social capital can be understood as the "instantiated
informal norm that promotes cooperation between two or
more individuals" (Fukuyama, 2001, p. 7). It assures social
community through shared basic cooperative orientations
on the individual level. The production of social capital
depends on volunteer organizations, associations, and
groups, which empower people to fight their causes--even
against powerful governments. Keane (2006, p. vii) defines
civil society as "the community of associations, initiatives,
movements and networks." Second, civil societies not only
create and sustain cohesion but are also still shaped by
cleavages, political inequalities, and differences in the
access to resources and social positions. Such cleavages are
marked by group-related boundaries between "us" and
"them"; it facilitates economic and social inclusion and
exclusion and, thereby, different chances of political
participation and of becoming an active community
member. It seems that as individuals become involved in
smaller communities characterized by interests and
lifestyle, they interact less with people who are different,
which affects inclusion negatively (e.g., Welch, Sikkink, &
Lovelend, 2007).
In the following, we understand civil society as
generated from individual social capital--its cohesion
results from (aggregated) individual feelings of affiliation to
a larger community.1 We, thereby, follow Coleman's
postulation of methodological-individualistic explanations
in social science (Coleman, 1994) stating that systemic or
societal phenomena have to be explained through
explanatory mechanisms on the micro level: While the
explanandum has to be on the macro level (in this case
social cohesion of the country), the explanation itself should
be carried out on the level of its components (individuals
and their attachments). We are interested in how religion
influences such feelings and thereby creates, sustains, or
changes cleavages within European civil societies.
Religion and Civil Society: Cohesion or Disjointedness?
The relationships between individuals, communities, and
civil society become especially complex when religion is
involved. The integrative impact of religion has been
continuously analyzed since Durkheim's (1912/2010) work
on this relationship. For Durkheim, religion provided the
necessary norms, meanings, rites and symbols and the
opportunity structure that facilitate interpersonal attachment
and, thereby, solidarity and social cohesion. More recent
research argues that despite trends of secularisation,2 there
still is a positive correlation between religious membership,
beliefs, and practices on the one hand and social capital and
integration on the other. Religiousness seems to lead to a
decline in delinquency (e.g., Hirschi & Stark, 1969; Stark,
1996; Stark & Bainbridge, 1987), anomic behavior (e.g.,
Bjarnason, 1998), and it increases social capital, as
Fukuyama (2001, p. 19) states, "There are two [ . . . ]
sources of social capital that may be more effective in
promoting civil society. The first is religion" (see also
Jagodzinski, 2009; Putnam, 2000; Smidt, 2003).3 Individual
religiousness seems to support the homogenizing and
integrating effect of civil societies.
Nevertheless, religion has also been proven to have
exclusionary powers against those who are not part of the
congregations, churches, or communities in power: That is,
the religiously induced trust does not necessarily encompass
all citizens and religion may add to "bonding" within
instead of "bridging" between societal groups (Welch,
Sikkink, Sartain, & Bond, 2004, p. 318). At the same time
as it integrates, religion may operate as a marker of group
boundaries between "us" and "them" and thereby facilitate
cohesion within the religious at the expense of the exclusion
of nonbelievers, people of other denominations or different
value systems (e.g., Bohn & Hahn, 2002; Gross & Ziebertz,
2010; Yuval-Davis, 2010).4 The inclusive influence of
religion is limited to only certain parts of society and
engenders cleavages that can result in discrimination
detrimental to the exercising of civil rights. On the
European level, it has been argued that in particular Islam
became the most prominent religious "other" over the last
two decades while a-confessional people are barely
discriminated against:
The first open, if not yet formal discussions of Turkey's
candidacy during the 2002 Copenhagen summit touches a raw
nerve among all kinds of European "publics." The widespread
debate revealed how much Islam with all its distorted
representations as "the other" of western civilisation was a real
issue rather than the extent to which Turkey was ready to meet
the same stringent economic and political conditions as all
other new members. (Casanova, 2006, p. 70; see also Gerhards,
2004; Spohn, 2009)
Religion as a Multilevel Phenomenon
It is not only the concurrent inclusive and exclusive effect
of religion that constitutes the complexity of its relationship
to social cohesion: Religion is a multilevel phenomenon
that comprises more than just the level of individual
religiosity. On the different societal levels, religion can be
Hjerm and Schnabel 3
expected to develop different kinds of influence on social
cohesion.
(a) Theories of civil society and social capital call our
attention to religious organizations, community work, and
religious groups (e.g., Coleman, 1988, p. 99). Religious
structures, similar to other forms of civic engagement, have
the power to create general social capital: "The social
capital generated by religious structures supports not only
formal religious volunteering but `secular' volunteering as
well" (Greeley, 1997, p. 592). In modern societies, it is,
however, an open question as to whether other civil society
organizations create social capital in a similar way or if
religious organizations are organizations of a special kind.
Religious organizations provide particular norm systems
and opportunity structures, but unions, sports clubs, or
social movement initiatives may serve as functional
equivalents in providing opportunity structures for civic
engagement and the production of social capital (e.g.,
Putnam, 1995). (b) Religion also develops its influence
through communal beliefs and shared systems of meanings,
morals, and values that have the power to engage members'
allegiance through interpretations, norms and sanctions. In
this way, religion shapes the understanding of civicness
within a society and what constitutes acceptable social
behavior. (c) Religion as an ideological system (as well as
its absenteeism) is manifested within governmental
structures as constitutions5 and welfare policies (e.g.,
Manow, 2005; Stark, 1996; Welch, Tittle, & Petee, 1991).
Such shared systems of understandings, customs,
regulations, and laws manifest themselves potentially on the
level of smaller regional communities, nation-states, or
larger cross-border collectives such as the EU (e.g.,
Grötsch, 2009; Schnabel & Grötsch, 2012).
For the following analysis, we focus on societal aspects
of religion on the country level as research evidence on this
level is mainly qualitative and quantitative studies are still
missing. The theoretical reason lies in the close relationship
between the nation-state and religion in Europe. On one
hand, national constitutions and policy systems are said to
mirror Christian social teaching and are understood as the
manifest result of conflicts between different religious and
political groups over history (e.g., Knippenberg, 2006;
Manow, 2005; Rokkan, 2000). On the other hand, the
national educational systems are major transmitters (and
homogenizers) of ideological and cultural perspectives and
understandings (e.g., classical: Gellner, 1983) and the state­
religion relationship is highly significant for religious
practices (Fox & Flores, 2009). Distinguishing between
such country-specific characteristics allows taking diverse
governmental settings into account.
Religion, as a contextual phenomenon, has the potential
to influence people's attitudes and behavior. However, we
can expect the influence of religion as a contextual
phenomenon to vary according to the type of religious
context. Both the way and the degree to which religion is
intertwined in civic societies vary across these societies. We
focus on the effects of three different aspects of religion as
a contextual phenomenon, namely, the institutional
interplay between the state and religion, the organizational
degree and the actual degree of religious heterogeneity on
the contextual level.
Nation, Religion, and Civil Societies
Why national identity--again? To Calhoun (1993), national
identity is "one genre of answers to the question of what
constitutes an autonomous political community capable of
self-determination" (p. 387). Such communities always
consist of individuals who identify themselves with other
(alleged) similar minded people. National identity is first
and foremost a trait of individuals. Only aggregated, it can
become a property of collectives (Hjerm, 1998; Hjerm &
Schnabel, 2010; Jones & Smith, 2001; Smith, 2000). It
constitutes a basis for the trust among those who are
considered "similar." Therefore, if we are interested in
country-specific degrees of social cohesion of civil societies
(and their changes), we have to consider individual
perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, and actions.
In contrast to other concepts of social cohesion (e.g.,
"generalized trust"), national identity provides an
objectivation for individual identification.6 Although the
imagined community of the nation most often unites around
underspecified ideas of similarity that may change over
time, the nation constitutes an intentional object toward
which people orient their imaginations, feelings,
understandings, and actions. Nations form a "community,
because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation
that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a
deep horizontal comradeship" (Anderson, 1983, p. 7). This
comradeship constitutes a social fact, in the Durkheimian
sense, that has the power to rebuke people to overcome
their egoistic individual interests. National identity--as
realized by individuals--embraces the emotional dimension
of loyalty, affiliation, and commitment that is far more
specific than general trust because it is rooted in
assumptions of similarities (whatever these assumptions are
based on). With such central characteristics of identification
and shared belonging, continuity, and stability, national
identity in its aggregated form can serve as a proxy for--a
special aspect of--social cohesion (e.g., Easterly, Ritzen, &
Woolcock, 2006).
National identity is part of individual identity formation
(e.g., Cohen, 1986; Jenkins, 1996) that provides a means for
individuals to understand who they are in relation to others.
National identity gains power by providing a clear
distinction between "us" and "them," or as Triandafyllidou
(1998) states, "The nation thus has to be understood as a
part of a dual relationship rather than as an autonomous,
self-contained unit" (p. 594). This relationship exists
irrespective of whether those "others" are situated within or
outside the state borders. It establishes an inclusive but yet
exclusive aspect of civil societies (some even argue that this
4 SAGE Open
aspect especially is a necessary precondition for the
legitimacy and acceptance of governments; for example,
Calhoun, 1993; Conversi, 2007; Miller, 1993; Weiner,
1997). National identity contributes to becoming part of a
group relating to a particular territory with clear-cut yet
negotiable borders.
There are two well-established dimensions of national
identity (Jones & Smith, 2001; Smith, 1991): The ethnic
dimension is characterized by ascribed/objective features
such as country of birth or common ancestry. The
civic/voluntaristic dimension includes a community
referring to laws and institutions, a shared political will,
equal rights for members of the nation, and a minimum of
common values, traditions, or a sentiment. Empirically,
they refer to two different dimensions of attachment that are
realized at the same time rather than two mutually exclusive
categories. Consequently, the population of countries can
exhibit different aggregated strengths of national identity
and the two dimensions can be mixed in different ways
(e.g., Hjerm, 1998, 2007; Lilli & Diehl, 1999). It can be
expected that different types of national identity are more
prevalent in certain countries than in others.
National identity gives one possible and quite exclusive
answer to the question of "who are the people?" that differs
from the answer of governmental citizenship rules. The
imagined community of the nation concurs with the citizens
of the state (only) when nation and state coincide
(Barrington, 1997). Often, however, nation and state are not
identical, as in Belgium, the United Kingdom, or Spain.
For the following analysis, we understand national
identity as an individual attitude that in its aggregated form
constitutes the social cohesion of civil societies. By using
the two dimensions of national identity as measurements of
two different facets of the social cohesion in civil societies,
we refer to a now-substantiated aspect of a community that
relates to a territory and that aims to realize political self-
determination.
We expect religion to play an important role in creating
and sustaining individual feelings of national identity.
According to Durkheim's thesis of the integrative effect of
religion, we expect that individual religiosity supports
national identity (see also Jones & Smith, 2001). According
to social capital theories, we expect a positive influence of
active membership and of a higher organizational degree of
religious organizations on the country level. The expected
effects on religion as a societal phenomenon are unclear.
Case study evidence suggests that a strong state­religion
relationship may support individual national identity, like in
Greece or Ireland (e.g., Halikiopoulou, 2008), while the role
the state­religion relationship plays in forming (collective)
identities seems to depend on the stronghold of the religious
organizations and on the discontinuities of political regimes
(Jakelic, 2004). From normative political theory, we may
gain the insight that (religious) heterogeneity might be
perceived as threatening the community (e.g., Miller, 1993;
Wolfe & Klausen, 1997). However, systematic,
comparative evidence is missing; therefore, we treat our
analysis of the contextual aspects of religion as explorative.
The Model
To address the research question as to whether and, if so,
how religion influences individual national identities in
Europe, comparative data on both religious affiliation and
individual national identity are needed. The European
Values Study (EVS; Integrated Data Set ZA4800) is a
large-scale, cross-national, survey research program that
provides insights into beliefs, preferences, attitudes, and
values of citizens in Europe. It is the only comparative
European data set that includes questions concerning
people's religious beliefs, practices, and memberships as
well as a list of questions on national identity. For the
following analysis, we use the fourth wave of 2008, which
covers the total of the 27 European member states.
We used the questions Q80.A to Q80.E of the EVS to
measure national identity:
Some people say the following things are important for
being truly [NATIONALITY]. Others say they are not
important. How important do you think each of the
following is?
Q80.A: To have been born in [COUNTRY]
Q80.B: To respect [COUNTRY]'s political institutions
and laws
Q80.C: To have [COUNTRY]'s ancestry
Q80.D: To be able to speak [THE NATIONAL
LANGUAGE]
Q80.E: To have lived for a long time in [COUNTRY]
The answers are coded between "1" and "4" where "1"
indicates "not important at all" and "4" for "very
important." Although the list of questions comprises only
five of the original eight items previously used in analysis
of ethnic and civic national identity (Hjerm, 1998; Jones &
Smith, 2001), a factor analysis indicates that these five
items gather into two factors. The first factor comprises
Q80.A, Q80.C, and Q80.E, the second factor Q80.B and
Q80.D. These factors are similar to previous studies and
correspond to (a) "ethnic national identity" comprising
Q80.A, Q80.C, and Q80.E and (b) "civic national identity"
comprising Q80.B and Q80.D. For our analysis, we use the
factor scores for each dimension. The ethnic dimension of
national identity mirrored in these questions emphasize the
two aspects of time and space and refer to the individual
being part of the autochthonous population, while the civic
dimension comprises of feeing bound to institutions.
Contextual Level Variables
To tap into religion at the country level, we use three
different measures. First, we include the institutional
cooperation between the state and religion. We therefore
Hjerm and Schnabel 5
use the mode of the state­religion relationship from the
State-and-Religion Data Set by Fox (2004). These data
describe the intersection between state and religion
monitoring governmental policies in favor of or against
churches, religious groups, and congregations worldwide.
We include a measurement of the official state­religion
relationship indicating whether a government has hostile
(0), inadvertent intense (1), separatist (2), accommodative
(3), supportive (4), cooperative (5) relationships or a civil
religion (6), or a state religion (7). These variables refer to
the degree of governmental secularization--The closer the
relation, the less is the degree of secularization.7 Second, we
measure the countries' religious homogeneity to capture the
societal religious context (the Herfindahl-Index for
religious heterogeneity is calculated from aggregated EVS
data).8 Because social capital theories consider volunteer
organizations, associations, and groups to be important for
social capital and therefore for social integration, we, third,
included the degree of religious and nonreligious
organizations. For this country-specific organizational
degree, we use the percentage of people per country who
are members of religious organizations and of nonreligious
organizations. Nonreligious organizations include social
organizations, political organizations, and leisure
organizations.
We control for the national economic situation
operationalized by gross domestic product (GDP), social
spending, and unemployment rate (all Eurostat data from
2007). These data are indicators of the distributive situation
within the country and its comparative wealth. They refer to
the redistributive and thereby secular aspects of societal
integration. In addition, we controlled for percentage of
immigrants (Eurostat data) and for language fractionalization
(Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, & Wacziarg,
2003). They refer to "cultural" cleavages in societies and
have been shown to influence national identities in previous
research (e.g., Hjerm & Schnabel, 2010). To avoid ending up
with a "basket model" of all possible influences on national
identity, we did not consider external, non­religion-related
factors to the nation-state such as globalization (Hall, 1997),
post-industrialization (Inglehart, 1997), or the involvement in
military conflicts (Boehnke, Kindervater, Baier, & Rippl,
2007).
Individual-Level Variables
Individual religiousness is differentiated into belonging to a
denomination (Roman Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox,
other, and none, coded as dummy variables) and intensity of
individual religiousness. To analyze whether the latter plays
a role in forming national identities, we created a multiplied
indicator "intensity" from the frequency of church
attendance (Q26) and the importance of God in everyday
life (Q36).9 The indicator is standardized between 0 and 1
and captures individual religious behavior as well as the
intensity of the belief.10
In accordance with social capital theory, we want to
know whether individual membership in civil society
organizations influences feelings of national identity. We
therefore created indicators for the individual membership
in religious, social, professional, and leisure organizations.11
For sociodemographic control variables we included the
respondents' sex, age, year of completed education, the
annual household income, the political left­right self-
assessment and their general trust in others. Although we
are not especially interested in the effects of these variables,
we control for them to ensure that variances in the
dependent variables are not due to their influence and that
the country-specific differences in trust do not depend on
their country-specific distributions.
The Multilevel Approach
Although the article is about the social cohesion of civil
societies, we are, strictly speaking, interested in whether
(religious) institutions matter for individual attitudes and
affiliations. This is because--following Coleman's research
program--we consider the degree of the social cohesion of
a civil society as aggregated from individual affiliations and
attitudes. In our interest in the feedback-effects of
institutions,12 we consider individuals as nested within
larger institutional contexts--in this case: within countries.
Hox and Kreft (1994) stated that "[i]t is important to note
that individuals and the social contexts in which they live
can be viewed as a hierarchical system of individuals and
groups, with individuals and groups defined at separate
levels of this hierarchical system" (p. 284).
Statistically, such multilevel problems cannot be solved
simply by generalizing results from one level to another
(Robertson, 1950). While wrong translations from a higher
(macro)level to a lower (micro)level bear the risk of
ecological fallacy because unobserved, intervening
influences of higher-level properties can interrupt the
relationship found on the individual micro level, atomistic
fallacies are committed when correlations on the individual
(average) level are wrongly generalized to the higher
(country) level.13 Besides the theoretical focus on the
feedback-effects of institutions on individual-level national
feelings and affiliations, statistically, the analysis of
aggregated country-averages of national identity runs the
risk disregarding the individual-level covariances and may
lead to wrong conclusions about the underlying
mechanisms.
Because we take country-level properties into
consideration and because we assume that individual
attitudes vary systematically according to these properties, a
multilevel analysis (MLA) is the method of choice (Hox,
1995). This method is explicitly designed to avoid wrong-
level fallacies and even if country characteristics are not
explicitly tested, MLA provides the means to control for
differences in country-specific distributions of individual
characteristics (Steenbergen & Jones, 2002). We use
6 SAGE Open
multilevel regression that is, effectively, an ordinary least
square regression (OLS-regression) which can handle
nested sources of variability such as individuals in nation-
states. Multilevel regression performs better than OLS-
regression if macro variables are included. The variation
within the dependent variable is due to two sources of
variation: variation within groups and between groups. If a
single-level model is performed, the assumption of
independency of the error terms is violated because
observations within a group can be expected to be more
similar than between groups, and standard errors are
underestimated (Hox, 2002; Snijders & Bosker, 1993). A
minor problem is that the number (N) of included countries
is only 27. We follow Snijders and Boskers (1993) arguing
that if N is equal to or greater than 10, a random intercept
model is preferable to a fixed model of regression analysis.
The Religious and National Landscape of Europe
First, descriptive analyses of the EVS data indicate that the
religious and national landscapes of Europe look quite
diverse (Figures 1 and 2).
There are very few countries with a single clearly
dominant majority denomination: Only Denmark has a
Protestant majority larger than 75%, indicating that the
Protestant North is less homogeneous than suggested. The
Catholic monoconfessional bloc with more than 75%
Catholics consists of Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Malta,
Lithuania, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. Classical
representatives like Spain are not in this group. Greece,
Cyprus, and Romania are countries dominated by an
Orthodox majority. Estonia and the Czech Republic have a-
confessional majorities that are close to 70%.
It is important to note that the European member states
are characterized quite differently concerning their
population's average values of the two dimensions of ethnic
and civic national identity. In most of the countries, ethnic
and civic national identities identified are in fact opposite
dimensions. Only in Great Britain, Malta, Cyprus, and
Slovenia both have a positive value. On average, ethnic
national identity shows a higher (positive and negative)
intensity than its civic counterpart. Cyprus, Bulgaria, Malta,
Poland, and Romania score quite highly with regard to
ethnic national identity, while Sweden, Spain, France, and
Denmark show a high average score of civic national
identity. The data so far confirm earlier findings by Hjerm
(1998, 2007) stating that ethnic and civic national identities
constitute two different dimensions of national identity and
that their combination varies across countries.
The Multi-Level Analysis
Because these average data on the country level
disguises what is going on at the individual level, we
performed a MLA. This MLA showed that country-level
properties matter for variances in national identities: The
empty model (not reported here) shows that 15.5% of the
total variance in ethnic national identity can be attributed
to differences on the country level, while country
differences are responsible for 10.4% of the variance in
civic national identity. As the relatively small number of
cases allow for only a restricted number of influencing
variables, we eliminated variables from the analysis if
they did not show significant influence and included the
macro-level variables stepwise.
Because we are not interested in general individual
influences on national identity, we are not commentating
extensively on the individual control variables. They do
not show any irregularities and are in line with former
research on national identity (e.g., Jones & Smith, 2001):
After controlling for country differences, women do not
differ significantly from men regarding their ethnic and
civic national identity, while age, education, a right-wing
self-assessment and a higher general trust increase both
types.
Concerning individual religiosity, the models show that,
compared with a-confessional persons, Catholics and
Protestants feature a higher degree of both types of national
identity, while being a member of the Orthodox Church has
a strong negative impact. The group of "other religious
memberships" is too heterogeneous and too small to be
meaningfully interpreted. However, we can assume that
membership of a religious diaspora makes it harder to feel
attached particularly to the ethnic dimension of national
identity. Although the impact of religious denomination is
straightforward in principle, there are some interesting
details: Catholicism and Protestantism both have a stronger
impact on ethnic than on civic national identity and
Protestants have a stronger affiliation to civic national
identity than Catholics. The negative impact of Orthodoxy
on both forms of national identity can be explained by the
Russian minorities in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania) who do not develop a national identity in their
host countries (cf. van Meur, 1999). They constitute a large
enough minority in the sample of the EVS that is
statistically responsible for a strong negative effect. This
effect is not compensated by a weak positive impact of the
orthodox people living in countries with an orthodox
majority.15
Independently of the denomination, intensity of
individual religiosity increases both ethnic and civic
national identity, with the increase for the latter being
larger. Being a member of a religious organization increases
the civic national identity (Model C5, Table 2), while it is
not important for the ethnic dimension (Model E6, Table 1).
Being a member of a social organization, however, affects
this dimension significantly. All in all, the results on the
individual level indicate that individual religiosity continues
to play an important role in national identity formation in
Europe and that--in accordance with social capital
theory--national identity is influenced by membership in
civil society organizations.

Figure 2. Aggregate national identity per country in Europe (ethnic and civic national identity per EU-member-state in 2008).14
The models E2 to E5 and C2 to C5 test for country
specifics. Concerning the social policy-related control
variables on this level, only the country's GDP shows a
significant influence16 on ethnic and civic national identity;
while the social policy-related indicators of secularity social
spending and unemployment rate had no significant effect.17
In addition, neither the share of immigrants nor language
fractionalization shows any significant impact.18 Insofar as
the GDP indicates the wealth of the nation-state, we might
conclude that the state's wealth supports a strengthening
effect on individual feelings of national identity.
While, on the individual level, religiosity influences both
ethnic and civic national identities in quite similar ways, the
country-specific religious contexts have a different impact
on each dimension. Looking at the state­religion
relationship, we find that the stronger the relationship is, the
stronger the ethnic identity (if the tie between state and
religion improves by one unit, ethnic national identity
increases by almost 0.2 factor scores),19 whereas civic
identity is not affected by the general state­religion
relationship at all.

Religious homogeneity results in stronger ethnic identity
(Model E4); if the Herfindahl-Index increases by one unit,
ethnic national identity increases almost by one factor
score. At the same time, civic identity is not affected by the
country's degree of religious pluralism. While religious
homogeneity can be related to societally shared systems of
meanings, beliefs, morals, and values, the organizational
degree of a country refers to networks and opportunity
structures. The organizational degree of religious
organizations affects neither ethnic nor civic national
identity in a significant way. The organizational degree of
other civic society organizations, however, influences
ethnic national identity negatively and strengthens civic
national identity.
The results of the MLA provided a systematic analysis
of religion as a context for individual national identities.
Not only individual religiosity but also religious
institutions and religious heterogeneity on the country
level continue to play a significant role in creating,
sustaining, and shaping such identities. All over Europe,
the state­religion relationship, the religious context, and
the organizational degree are important for feelings of
national affiliation. These factors, however, affect the two
dimensions of national identity, the ethnic and the civic,
in quite different ways, indicating that the two
dimensions in fact relate to different mechanisms of
identity formation.
Civil Society, Government, and Religion--
Discussion of the Results
The results show that religion and national identities in
Europe are still interlinked. The analysis indicates,
however, that it is important to treat religion as a
multilevel phenomenon whose influences reaches beyond
the level of individual religiosity. Especially, when the
feeling of social inclusion into the civil society is in
focus, it is important to take individual beliefs and
practices but also memberships and the institutional and
societal contexts in which they flourish into account. Our
comparative perspective makes it possible to consider
these factors and it revealed that different dynamics
between religion and national identification take place in
Europe. The analyses help to understand that it is not the
nation-state as such, but particular--in this case,
religion-related--contextual factors that shape individual
national identities.20
Independently of country-specific differences,
individual religious beliefs and actions are important for
both dimensions of national identity. Compared with a-
confessional people, Catholics and Protestants have
stronger feelings of both kinds of national identity, with
Protestants being even more strongly tied to the nation
than Catholics, while Orthodox believers and people of
other denominations have weaker national feelings. It
seems that secularization on the individual level--at
least with regards to Protestantism and Catholicism in
Europe--weakens national identity with a stronger
impact on its ethnic component and thereby affects
negatively the aspect of social cohesion that concerns
autochthony.
Our models suggest that, in principle, national identity
in Europe does not overwrite religious cleavages but
seems to follow them. For the debates on civil society,
this means that religion still is an important maker of
societal cleavages. It seems, however, that the
differences between Protestantism and Catholicism are
less important than the differences between
Protestantism/Catholicism on one hand and a-
confessional people and Orthodoxy on the other. With
regard to the discussions that took place in Europe
concerning the formation of European identity, one
might add that there is an additional cleavage forming
between Christianity on one hand and Islam on the other.
Unfortunately, our data do not allow for testing this
aspect.
Although the analysis shows that the influence of
individual religiousness is effective all over Europe, the
increased percentage of the total variance due to the country
differences indicates that there are country-level differences
among the member states despite the homogenizing
tendencies of the European Commission concerning
religion.21
One factor that is responsible for these country
differences is the state­religion relationship. Although it
does not change the individual-level results, it is partly
responsible for the country differences. Here religion and
national identity overlap as well; a close relationship
between state and religion constitutes more intense feelings
of ethnic national identity. This can be seen as an indicator
for the built-in character of religion: That is, religion in
countries with a supportive relationship between state and
religion may serve as an integral component of the self-
understanding of the ethnic nation. This result supports case
studies about the sometimes-close relationship between
nation and religion indicating that this relationship is
mediated by the governmental alignments (e.g.,
Halikiopoulou, 2008).
The social capital hypotheses suggest that civil
society organizations create and maintain social capital
and social cohesion. It is partly supported by the finding
that the organizational degree of nonreligious
organizations strengthens civic national identity and
weakens its ethnic aspect. However, our results offer an
even more detailed picture: The different impact on
ethnic and civic national identity suggests that there are
different forms of social capital--some of which seem to
work more inclusively and others are more exclusive.
Civil society organizations seem to "bridge" and to
include only with regard to the civic aspects of political
10 SAGE Open
institutions and the national language while they
emphasize differences and cleavages concerning the
ethnic aspects of autochthony. Here, they seem to
support feelings of belonging at the expense of "the
other." It seems as Welch et al. (2007) are right in their
observations that not all kinds of civil society
organizations support social cohesion to the same extend.
The results suggest that civil societies in Europe are
neither homogeneous nor necessarily inclusive on the
individual level. There are different degrees of social
cohesion concerning the civil and the ethnic aspects of
national identity, and both are differently supported by
individual religiousness, civil society organizations and
the state­religion relationship. Most importantly, the
governmental sphere provides the institutional
framework in which social capital can develop and social
cohesion is created and maintained: A cooperative state­
religion relationship lessens religious cleavages, which,
in turn, tie in with feelings of ethnic national identity.
Civil societies are shaped by the history and design of
the governmental context (as, for example, Jakelic, 2004,
has shown for Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia, and
Slovenia). Our data imply that it matters for the
individual feelings of national identity how the
organizational specification of religion is interlinked
with the state. Civil societies might legitimize or control
governments; their cleavages, however, are influenced
by the state's institutions. In this regard, institutions
matter for individual attitudes and by this, for the way in
which civil societies are structured. One might even say
that the governmental settings facilitate exclusive and
inclusive tendencies in civil society and thereby the
possibilities of participation.
It is, however, not only the institutional framework
that works as a country-level context for civil society
cohesion or for the unfolding of its cleavages. Religious
homogeneity indicating socially shared value, belief,
and, perhaps, even lifestyle systems, is strongly tied to
ethnic national identity. This suggests that when
religious cleavages are not salient in civil societies
because of their religious homogeneity, religion seem to
be a silent (in the sense of a "quasi-self-evident")
component of the nation. While some researchers argue
that religion and nation coincide mainly in the Protestant
North (e.g., Riis, 1989; Rokkan, 2000), our results
suggest that this is the case independently of the
denomination, including Catholic countries such as
Ireland as well as Orthodox countries such as Greece or
Bulgaria, where religion is an integral part of what is
considered as the nation. When, however, religious
cleavages become salient through heterogeneity, religion
as part of the nation becomes subject to societal
negotiation and the relationship is no longer clear-cut.
Civil society is then marked by these religious
differences and distortions, and we may expect to find
ethnic conflicts developing under these circumstances.

Notes
1. For the derivation of social cohesion from individual attitudes
and feelings, see, for example, Friedkin (2004).
2. There is a longstanding debate about the decline of religion in
Europe. Without wading too deeply into this debate, three
dimensions of secularization can be distinguished: First,
according to Weber's (1922/2006) thesis of the "enchantment
of the world," secularization refers to the replacement of
religious explanations by scientific ones in modern societies.
An alternative notion claims that secularization refers to the
progressive functional differentiation reducing religion to one
among other functional spheres in society (Luhmann, 1977).
Secularization, secondly, is understood as individualization of
religion stating that people decide what they want to believe in
including changes to esoteric beliefs and alternative religions
(Davie, 1990, 2000; Luckmann, 1967). Third, according to the
economic market model, secularization stems from the lack of
sufficient religious answers to a stable and constant demand for
transcendence because of a lack of competition (Stark &
Bainbridge, 1987). Empirically, secularization seems to occur
in Europe, but to different extents and with different dynamics
(Berger, 2001; Davie, 2000; Greeley, 2002; Halman &
Draulans, 2006; Iannaccone, Stark, & Finke, 1998; Pew
Research Center, 2002; Pollock, 2008).
3. While Hervieu-Léger (2006) argues on a macrosociological
level that religion has the power to stabilize the social cohesion
of societies, Welch, Sikkink, and Loveland (2007) were able to
demonstrate that and also how individual religiousness
supports general trust.
4. Hunsberger and Jackson (2005) identified ethnical or racial,
homosexual and communist groups, feminists, and religious
out-groups as possible targets for religiously motivated
exclusion or discrimination.
5. For example, the constitutions of the Czech Republic, France,
Slovenia, and Slovakia state explicitly that the state is a secular
one.
6. Generalized trust became the key component of social capital.
Most survey-related research refers to the question, "Generally
speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that
12 SAGE Open
you need to be very careful in dealing with people?" generated
by Noelle-Neumann in 1948. This operationalization, however,
makes it problematic to compare trust between individuals and
between countries (e.g., Delhey, Newton, & Welzel, 2011;
Welch et al., 2007). Therefore, we decided to use the concept
of national identity instead.
7. Because the data indicate an institution that was implemented
in time before the measurement of the individual national
affiliation, we are safe to establish a causal direction from these
institutions toward individual attitudes.
8. We calculated the religious related Herfindahl-Index as the
normalized sum of the squared percentage of a country's
denominations (a-confessional, catholic, protestant, orthodox,
others).
9. For the following analysis, we are not interested in the
particular content or dogma of the different denominations. We
are interested in the individual attitudes.
10.We tested both aspects of individual religiosity separately.
They pointed into the same direction in all models. Therefore,
it seemed sensible to reduce variables by collapsing them.
11.Social organizations comprise welfare organizations,
community activities, and social movements; professional
organizations comprise trade unions, political parties, and
professional associations; and leisure organizations comprise
cultural activities, sports, and youth organizations.
12.Institutional feedback effects are extensively discussed by
Pierson (2000), Mau (2002), and Svallfors (2012).
13.Diez-Roux (1988) developed this argument on the basis of the
following example: Income and coronary heart disease
mortality are correlated inversely on the individual level, per
capita income and coronary heart disease mortality is
correlated positively on the country level when non-European
countries are considered.
14.We are not particularly interested in country-specific
differences in national identities beyond their interaction with
religion. Therefore, we keep the description of the European
national landscape brief and do not discuss further
implications. The country means and standard deviations are
reported in Table A1.
15.The strong negative impact of orthodoxy on the national
identities outside orthodox majority countries is shown in
Table A2 of the appendix. The weak impact of Orthodoxy in
countries with an orthodox majority is statistically due to high
levels of individual religiousness and national identity without
much variance in both variables.
16.Coefficients are considered significant on a p < .05-level.
17.Results are not reported here but can be displayed on request.
18.Although these results partly counter previous research, they
might be explainable by the fact that both need to be made
salient by political or mass media articulation in order to
become influential. This is argued, for example, in
connection with group threat theory: It is not the mere
numbers but their interpretation and significance that
influence peoples' attitudes (e.g., Hjerm, 2007; similarly
King & Wheelock, 2007).
19.The gross domestic product (GDP) functions as a confounding
variable.
20.For a critical view on the widespread methodological
nationalism that treats the station-state as an undifferentiated
independent variable, see Glick Schiller, Basch, and Szanton-
Blanc (1995).
21.The EU's attempts to harmonize European societies show in
their different initiatives concerning religion:
antidiscrimination regulation concerning the freedom of
religion, the attempt to create a constitution including a
reference to Christianity, and the increased dialogue between
the EU Commission and the churches to give "a soul to

Author Biographies
Mikael Hjerm is professor of sociology at Umeå University
(Sweden). He studies nationalism and xenophobia in a comparative
perspective, focusing on how institutional differences can explain
peoples' perception of themselves and others. He also works with
questions of integration and multiculturalism. He is the national
coordinator for the European Social Survey.
Annette Schnabel is professor of sociology at Bergische
Universität Wuppertal (Germany). Her research interests cover the
questions of why people join social movements; how they form
their national, religious, and gender identities; and how emotions
and rational choices interact. The impact of political and social
institutions and their formation form another focal point of
interest. The research on these issues encompasses empirical
analyses as well as their impact on social theory.
