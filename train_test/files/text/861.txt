Family violence, employment status, welfare
benefits, and alcohol drinking in the United
States: what is the relation?
E Rodriguez, K E Lasch, P Chandra, J Lee
Abstract
Objectives--This study examined the con-
tribution of employment status, welfare
benefits, alcohol use, and other individual,
and contextual factors to physical aggres-
sion during marital conflict.
Methods--Logistic regression models
were used to analyse panel data collected
in the National Survey of Families and
Households in 1987 and 1992. A total of
4780 married or cohabiting persons re-
interviewed in 1992 were included in the
analysis. Domestic violence was defined as
reporting that both partners were physi-
cally violent during arguments.
Results--It was found that non-employed
respondents are not at greater risk of
family violence in comparison with em-
ployed respondents, after controlling for
alcohol misuse, income, education, age,
and other factors; however, employed per-
sons receiving welfare benefits are at
significantly higher risk. Alcohol misuse,
which remains a predictor of violence
even after controlling for other factors,
increases the risk of family violence while
satisfaction with social support from fam-
ily and friends decreases it.
Conclusion--These results underscore the
important eVect of alcohol misuse on
domestic violence, and the need to moni-
tor the potential impact of welfare reform
on domestic violence.

Family violence has been recognised as a pub-
lic health problem for almost a decade,1 and the
health care cost associated with treatment of
family violence injuries in the United States has
been estimated as high as $857 million
annually.2 In analysis of 1985 National Vio-
lence Survey data, Straus and Gelles found an
annual incidence of marital aggression of
approximately 16%.3 In 1992, 12% of all
homicides were the result of intrafamilial
violence.4 Estimates are that as many as 2 to 4
million women a year are physically battered by
their intimate partners.5 Men are as likely as
women to resort to physical aggression during
marital conflicts but women are more likely to
report injury from such interchanges.6
Family violence has been associated with
gender and power issues7­9; structural and
sociodemographic characteristics such as age,
socioeconomic status, unemployment, cohabit-
ing status, and partnership stability10­13; alcohol
and drug misuse14 15 and depression.16 17 The
research on family violence has produced
results that are diYcult to integrate conceptu-
ally or empirically. Most of this research has
been on small select samples and cross
sectional.
The role of alcohol in violence is especially
controversial.14 18 19 Studies have found that
alcohol use may aggravate marital diYculties
leading to separation or divorce,17 and alcohol
problems may have an indirect eVect on earn-
ings and marriage.20 21 One longitudinal study,
however, found that alcohol consumption was
significantly related to physical aggression six
months immediately before and after marriage,
but the eVects washed out at 18 months.22
Others have suggested that structural factors
such as unemployment may disrupt commu-
nity and social relationships leading to greater
risk behaviour such as alcohol consumption.13
Unemployment, however, has been inconsist-
ently related to both alcohol intake13 23 and vio-
lent incidents.24 Job loss has been found to be
related to an increase of negative behaviours
between partners,24 but again the relation
between job loss and violence is not clear cut.
While small increases in lay oVs are associated
with more violent incidents, large increases are
associated with reduced incidence.25
Employment in itself does not necessarily
protect couples from marital violence. Stressful
work experiences have also been found to be
associated with wife abuse.26 In addition, it has
been suggested that an increase of female
employment and transitions towards diVerent
forms of relationships may generate tensions
that could increase the likelihood of marital
violence.27 This is particularly relevant given
our fast changing economy and increasing
employment demands on young parents,28 29
including those receiving welfare benefits.
There is evidence that welfare reform
accounted for 44% of the employment rate
gain from 1992 to 1996,30 31 and The Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Recon-
ciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104­193)
will force more women with young children to
work. In the current policy debate, not only is
there little concern with the impact of welfare
reform on women's health,32 but little thought
has been given to a potential for increased
domestic violence.
Increasingly social scientists note the
importance of taking context into account
when explaining outcomes and the necessity of
looking at the way in which family, work, and
community factors interrelate to explain atti-
tudes and behaviours.33­36 Research on violence

economic environmental factors.37 38
The goal of this study is to contribute to our
understanding of the complex and important
issue of family violence. Using panel data from
the 1987 and 1992 National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH), we attempt to
disentangle the eVects of employment, partner-
ship instability, and alcohol use in the risk of
domestic violence.
Figure 1 summarises our explanatory model.
We take advantage of longitudinal data and
controlling for individual and household char-
acteristics and prior problems with alcohol
misuse, violent arguments, and joblessness
(1987 and 1991 variables), we ascertain the
influence of current alcohol misuse, and
employment status on current violence (1992
variable). Our explanatory model draws from a
sociostructural approach, in the sense that vio-
lent arguments are seen as arising from chang-
ing and increasing demands placed on the
family,26 38 and from a social learning approach
that considers the influence of variables such as
occupational status on the onset of violence.26
We broaden the employment status variable to
include working and receiving welfare.
Methods
DATA
The 1987 NSFH survey consisted of inter-
views with 13 017 respondents, including an
over-sample of minorities and households con-
taining single parent families, stepfamilies,
recently married couples, and cohabiting
couples. The 1992 survey includes a re-
interview of 10 008 surviving members of the
original sample, which represents an attrition
rate of 23%. We analysed possible diVerences
between respondents to the 1992 survey and
those who were lost to follow up after the 1987
interview. There were no significant diVerences
in attrition rates by gender, age, ethnic group,
and marital status between those who were
re-interviewed and those lost to follow up. We
limited our study to respondents older than 16
years of age in 1987, and who were not retired
in 1992. A total of 4770 married or cohabiting
individuals were included in our analyses.
MEASURES
In this study we focus on violent arguments in
which both partners participate. About 60% of
respondents who engaged in violent arguments
in 1992 reported that both partners used
physical violence (151 of 247). Of 247
respondents who reported having violent argu-
ments only 25 reported being the only
perpetrator of violence, and 71 said that only
the spouse or partner used violence. We
considered these two groups to be too small to
include in our analysis and excluded them. We
explored possible reporting diVerences be-
tween the three variants of family violence--
that is, spouse/partner violent, respondent vio-
lent, and both mutually violent. In general,
those who reported that only the partner used
physical violence were, on average, older (mean
age 35.4 versus 33.4 years) and more educated
(mean of 13.6 versus 12.5 years) than those
who also reported being active participants in
violent arguments.
As noted in a previous analysis of the NSFH,
women were as likely as men to commit violent
acts, but women were more likely to report
being injured than men.39 Here we focus on
predictors of violent interchanges not on their
possible consequences.
Our dependent variable, family violence, was
measured by the question: In the past year, did
both respondent and partner become physi-
cally violent during an argument? We investi-
gated potential diVerences between respond-
ents and non-respondents to this question in
terms of gender, alcohol drinking patterns,
race/ethnicity, and total number of children in
the household. The number of non-
respondents was small (n=171) and no signifi-
cant diVerences were observed between
groups.
We constructed an employment situation
variable from several variables that asked about
respondents' employment and sources of
income in 1992. Respondents were divided
into four categories: (a) full time employed, (b)
part time employed, (c) working while receiv-
ing welfare benefits, and (d) non-employed.
Given the few episodes of violence reported by
retired people (only 2 of 327 retired respond-

ents reported violence), this group was not
included in our analysis. Of all 1055 non-
employed respondents only 76 were looking for
work, and of those only six reported violent
arguments, which did not allow us to look at
them separately. In addition, 208 non-
employed respondents were receiving some
type of social or welfare benefits. Preliminary
analysis showed that they were not statistically
diVerent from other non-working people, and
we kept them together to increase the statistical
power of our model.
We used the total number of drinks that the
respondent had in the past 30 days as our
measure of alcohol drinking in 1992. Covari-
ates we controlled for were the respondent's
gender, age, race/ethnicity, partnership stabil-
ity, years of education, total household income,
number of children in the household, satisfac-
tion with friends and family, and having a
mental or physical condition that could limit
the ability to work for pay. Partnership stability
was measured as three diVerent types of
partnership: (a) respondents that were in stable
relationships (that is, married or living together
in 1992 to the same person as in 1987); (b)
respondents that have a diVerent partner than
the one they had in 1987; and (c) new couples
(that is, those who were not married or living
together in 1987). Besides taking into consid-
eration partnership stability, we explored
whether other partner characteristics such as
having had problems with alcohol or drugs
could have an impact on predicting family vio-
lence. However, very few respondents indi-
cated that their partners or other family mem-
bers have had problems with drugs or alcohol
in 1987, and we were not able to include this
variable in our analysis.
Other background factors included in our
model were number of weeks unemployed and
looking for work in 1991, reporting engaging in
violent arguments in 1987, and having alcohol
problems in 1987.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We conducted logistic regression analyses to
examine the relations of interest using SAS.40
In all our analyses, we weight the survey
responses to account for the over-sampling of
special populations in the survey, including
African American, single parent families, fami-
lies with step children, cohabiting couples and
recently married persons. The weights were
prepared by the NSFH researchers.41 We used
Box-Cox transformation of the income, and
alcohol intake variables, a frequently used pro-
cedure that smoothes out the eVect of outlier
values and approximates the variables to a nor-
mal distribution. The transformations were
suYcient to produce reasonable residual plots
(see tables for details on the transformations
used). We examined the correlations among all
variables, performed diagnostic tests for col-
linearity, and no problems were found.
We did not replace any missing values of the
dependent variable. For the categorical inde-
pendent variables we added an additional
group of "no response or not applicable" where
necessary, in order to include all respondents in
our analysis. For the continuous independent
variables we replaced missing values by imput-
ing them with the predicted value estimated for
the age, gender, ethnic, marital status, and
employment situation group of the respondent.
Firstly, we conducted logistic regression in
our full model described in figure 1. To have
suYcient cell size to examine interaction eVects
between employment situation and social sup-
port, alcohol use, and number of children, we
then dropped some of the variables that were
non-significant in our first analysis, and created
a shorter model. Our reduced model controls
for age, sex, income, education, and prior
violence (1987), while analysing the impact of
current employment status, alcohol drinking,
satisfaction with relationships, and number of
children in the household. We then ran three
separate models with interactions for satisfac-
tion with relationships, alcohol misuse, and
number of children.
Results
Table 1 presents a description of our sample.
Of 4780 respondents, 151 report engaging in
arguments in which both partners were physi-
cally violent toward each other. As shown in
table 1, women were slightly more likely than
men to report the occurrence of violent
arguments.
The average household income and years of
education are lower among those who report
violent arguments than among those who do
not report them. Respondents who engage in
violent arguments have more children, and
report more alcohol drinking and weeks of
unemployment in 1991 than respondents who
do not report violence. The average age of
respondents engaging in violent arguments is
33 years (SD 6.7), while the average age of
those not resorting to violence is 40 years (SD
10).
Full time employed people are less likely and
those working while receiving welfare benefits
are more likely to report violence relative to
other employment status groups. Working part
time and being non-employed does not in-
crease the risk of violence. African American
KEY POINTS
x Employed persons receiving welfare ben-
efits are at significantly higher risk of
domestic violence.
x Non-employed respondents are not at
greater risk of family violence relative to
employed persons. However, alcohol in-
teracts with non-employment to predict
violence.
x In contrast with popular perception race/
ethnicity is not a significant factor in pre-
dicting violent arguments when other
factors are accounted for.
x Two factors significantly reduce the
likelihood of engaging in violent argu-
ments: age and satisfaction with relation-
ships with friends and family (other than
the spouse).

respondents report more violent arguments
than white respondents or those categorised as
others.
Because of sample size considerations we
were not able to analyse men and women sepa-
rately. Table 1 includes a description of the
sample by gender group, and the possible
implications of not analysing them separately
are considered in the discussion section.
Table 2 presents the results of our first logis-
tic regression analyses using the full model
described in figure 1. Significant predictors for
violent arguments include number of children
in the household, alcohol drinking in 1992, and
previous (1987) history of engaging in violent
arguments. The risk of violence was greater for
people who were working while receiving
welfare relative to the referent (full time
employed).
Two factors significantly reduce the likeli-
hood of engaging in violent arguments: age and
satisfaction with relationships with family
(other than spouse) and friends. Higher
income and education are also associated with
less likelihood of reporting violence, but the
confidence intervals are relatively wide.
Men and women are not significantly diVer-
ent in reporting having arguments in which
both partners were physically violent. Other
factors that are not statistically significant in
predicting violence include race/ethnicity, part-
nership stability, having a physical or mental
limitation that could restrict the ability of
working for pay, the numbers of week of unem-
ployment while looking for work in 1991, and
previous (1987) history of having alcohol
problems.
Table 3 presents the results of our reduced
model where we dropped variables that did not
attain significance in the full model, and three
separate models that include reduced model
variables and interaction eVects for employ-
ment status and satisfaction with relationships
or alcohol misuse or number of children. In our
reduced model we find that people working
while receiving welfare are almost four times
more likely to report violence than other work-

ing respondents. Number of alcohol drinks,
and number of children in the family are again
significant risk factors for violent arguments,
and satisfaction with social relationships sig-
nificantly protects against violence.
Columns 2 to 4 of table 3 summarise our
analyses that include interaction eVects. We
run interactions of employment status with the
other three factors significantly associated with
violence and of theoretical interest to us--
satisfaction with relationships, alcohol drinks
and number of children in the family in
separate, parallel models. Relative to full time
workers a higher number of children signifi-
cantly increases the risk of violence for the
non-employed. Relative to full time workers
more alcohol drinks slightly increases the risk
of violence for the non-employed. Numbers of
children and alcohol drinks does not signifi-
cantly increase the risk of violence for those
working while receiving welfare relative to full
time workers. Satisfaction with relationships
does not significantly interact with employ-
ment status to predict violence. We do not
include a model with all main and interaction
eVects because of cell size considerations. Thus
we cannot simultaneously compare the modify-
ing eVects of alcohol drinks, satisfaction with
relationships and number of children on the
relationship between employment status and
violence.
Discussion
In this study we focus on arguments in which
both partners engage in physical violence,
which represent about 60% of cases of family
violence in the NSFH. People who are only
recipients of violence by their partners may
have diVerent characteristics than those who
react violently, and should be studied sepa-
rately. In addition, it should be noted that our
sample included respondents who were in a
stable relationship between 1987 and 1992,
and those who were in a new or diVerent rela-
tionship in 1992. Respondents that were not in
a relationship in 1992 could not be included in
the analysis. Generalisations to the whole US
population should be made cautiously.
The greatest strength of this study is that it is
based on a national probability sample thereby
reducing sample selection bias and includes a
rich set of important variables to permit exam-
ination of potential confounders. Our study
presents a number of important findings. In
contrast with popular perception we find that
race/ethnicity is not a significant factor in pre-
dicting violent arguments when other factors
are accounted for. Partnership instability has
not been controlled for in previous studies of
alcohol and family violence; however, we find
partnership instability to not be a risk factor for
violence, after controlling for other factors.
As previously reported in the literature, alco-
hol use is positively associated with violent
arguments in the same year. Alcohol use five
years earlier seems not to aVect current
violence. Prior research has not clarified the
modifying eVect of alcohol misuse on the rela-
tion between unemployment and violence. We
do find that alcohol interacts with non-
employment to predict violence; alcohol use,
moreover, does not increase the risk of violence
among other employed groups in relation to
the full time employed. It should be noted that
we used a measure of alcohol intake widely
used in the alcohol research literature (that is,
number of drinks in the past 30 days).42 Many
of our other variables of interest report events
in the past 6 or 12 months, which may possibly
limit the usefulness of the alcohol variable. We

were constrained in our choice of this variable
because the NSFH does not provide infor-
mation on whether the alcohol drinking
pattern of respondents was any diVerent during
the rest of the year.
This study has certain limitations. Our
exclusion criteria, and the factors we control
for in our model, should eliminate most of the
diVerences among the various groups of people
included in our model, but uncontrolled
variables determining both resources and
outcomes may still exist. People who have anti-
social personality characteristics are also likely
to drink in large amounts43­45; making causal
interpretations diYcult because of potential
confounding of characteristics of people most
likely to be violent with the circumstances
under which they drink and become violent.
Neither personality characteristics nor circum-
stances can explain alcohol related violence
without consideration of the purposes served
by drinking and the properties of alcohol in
relation to violence.46 Personality characteris-
tics are not included as variables in our study,
but we control for previous history of both vio-
lence and alcohol problems. Those who
reported violent arguments in 1987 are almost
six times more likely to report violence in 1992.
Under-reporting is an additional limitation
of most studies of family violence because it is
a sensitive issue about which people may be
hesitant to speak openly. The possible reasons
for under-reporting in the NSFH data have
been previously discussed.39 The NSFH placed
the violence questions in the middle of a
lengthy interview, and kept the questions
general rather than specific. In addition, the
questions referred to violence only in the con-
text of disagreements, while violent abuse
could occur without being prompted by a disa-
greement, and sexual violence was not in-
cluded in the definition. When we analysed the
small number of missing responses to the
violence questions we did not find evidence of
diVerences between respondents and non-
respondents regarding, age, sex or marital sta-
tus.
Sample size considerations did not allow us
to run models separately for men and women
taking into account who was the perpetrator of
the violence. In future research it would be
useful to study men and women separately to
better understand the possible relation be-
tween women employment patterns, age of
children in the household, and other determi-
nants that could influence the permanence of
women in violent relationships. In future stud-
ies it would also be useful to include additional
information on partners' characteristics.
Larger sample sizes, new methods of diminish-
ing underreporting, and/or diVerent method-
ological approaches will be necessary to build
on this line of research.
In conclusion, perhaps the most important
findings of this study are the increased risk of
violence if working and receiving welfare and
the inhibiting eVect of satisfaction with social
relationships on violence. In view of recent
welfare reform strategies our findings are
particularly relevant. Our results indicate that,
relative to the employed, people working while
receiving welfare could be at greater risk for
violence.
One plausible explanation for the increased
risk for respondents receiving welfare while
working is that the additional stress associated
with working in low skills jobs when coping
with poverty and child care issues puts people
at a higher risk of family violence. Recent
research shows that working couples with small
children tend to work more hours than others,
and they report the lowest quality of life among
working couples (P Moen et al, Annual
Meeting of the American Association of
Science, Anaheim, California, January 1999).
However, we find that more children slightly
increases the risk of violence only for the
unemployed relative to full time workers. This
suggests that job conditions, for example, low
skill or less secure; personality characteristics;
stigma related to receiving welfare; or some
other unmeasured characteristic may explain
this very intriguing result.
At any rate, this study suggests we should
continue to take a comprehensive approach to
problems of domestic violence. We have identi-
fied a group who is particularly at risk for fam-
ily violence, which makes it critical to monitor
the impact of welfare reform on family
violence.
