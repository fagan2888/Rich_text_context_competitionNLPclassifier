Violence, Crime, and Abuse Exposure
in a National Sample of Children and Youth
An Update
David Finkelhor, PhD; Heather A. Turner, PhD; Anne Shattuck, MA; Sherry L. Hamby, PhD
Evidence continues to accumulate that there are seri-
ous consequences to health and well-being and soci-
ety from childhood exposure to violence and abuse.1,2
Child maltreatment, peer victimization, and exposure to fam-
ily and community violence have been shown to be con-
nected to developmental difficulties, problem behavior, and
physical and mental health effects extending throughout the
life span.3-6 However, the epidemiology of child victimiza-
tion remains fragmented,7 with published studies8,9 on lim-
ited portions of the age and exposure spectrum and only oc-
casionally with a national scope. Controversies persist about
the most common forms of victimization, age of maximum ex-
posure across type, and trends over time.10-12
In an effort to improve the epidemiology and make it more
comprehensive, the US Department of Justice and the Centers
forDiseaseControlandPreventionhavecombinedresourcesto
support a more regular and systematic national assessment of
children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse. In 2008, the
first such assessment, the National Survey of Children's Expo-
sure to Violence I (NatSCEV I), was conducted.13 The next wave
inthisassessment,conductedin2011,hasbeencompleted.This
article provides updated epidemiology on the exposure of chil-
dren to violence, crime, and abuse based on those data.

IMPORTANCE Because exposure to violence, crime, and abuse has been shown to have
serious consequences on child development, physicians and policymakers need to know the
kinds of exposure that occur at various developmental stages.
OBJECTIVES To provide updated estimates of and trends for childhood exposure to a broad
range of violence, crime, and abuse victimizations.
DESIGN The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence was based on a
cross-sectional, US national telephone survey conducted in 2011.
SETTING Interviews by telephone.
PARTICIPANTS The experiences of 4503 children and youth aged 1 month to 17 years were
assessed by interviews with caregivers and with youth in the case of those aged 10 to 17 years.
RESULTS Two-fifths (41.2%) of children and youth experienced a physical assault in the last
year, and 1 in 10 (10.1%) experienced an assault-related injury. Two percent experienced
sexual assault or sexual abuse in the last year, but the rate was 10.7% for girls aged 14 to 17
years. More than 1 in 10 (13.7%) experienced maltreatment by a caregiver, including 3.7% who
experienced physical abuse. Few significant changes could be detected in rates since an
equivalent survey in 2008, but declines were documented in peer flashing, school bomb
threats, juvenile sibling assault, and robbery and total property victimization.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The variety and scope of children's exposure to violence,
crime, and abuse suggest the need for better and more comprehensive tools in clinical and
research settings for identifying these experiences and their effects.

aged 1 month to 17 years in 2011. Study interviews were con-
ducted over the telephone by the employees of an experi-
enced survey research firm. Telephone interviewing is a cost-
effective method14,15 that has been demonstrated to be
comparable with in-person interviews in data quality, even for
reports of victimization, psychopathology, and other sensitive
topics.16-21 In fact, some evidence suggests that telephone in-
terviewsareperceivedbyrespondentsasmoreanonymous,less
intimidating, and more private than in-person modes16,22 and,
as a result, may encourage greater disclosure of victimization
events.16Allprocedureswereauthorizedbytheinstitutionalre-
view board of the University of New Hampshire.
The primary foundation of the study design was a nation-
wide sampling frame of residential telephone numbers from
which a sample of telephone households was drawn by ran-
dom digit dialing. Two additional samples were obtained to
represent the growing number of households that rely en-
tirely or mostly on cell phones, including a small national
sample of cellular telephone numbers drawn from the ran-
domdigitdialingmethod(n = 31)andanaddress-basedsample
(n = 750). The address-based sample started with a national
sample of addresses from the postal Delivery Sequence File.
These addresses were mailed a 1-page questionnaire. The ad-
dress-basedsamplewasdrawnfromthepoolofreturnedques-
tionnaires that represented households with children and
youth 17 years or younger. These households were then re-
contacted by interviewers and asked to participate in the
survey. Approximately one-half of the eligible households ob-
tained through the address-based sample were cell phone­
only households and represented an effective way to include
households without landlines in our sample.
Procedure
A short interview was conducted with an adult caregiver (usu-
ally a parent) to obtain family demographic information. One
child was then randomly selected from all eligible children liv-
ing in a household by selecting the child with the most recent
birthday. If the selected individual was aged 10 to 17 years, the
main telephone interview was conducted with the child. If the
selected child was younger than 10 years, the interview was
conducted with the caregiver who "is most familiar with the
child's daily routine and experiences."
Respondents were promised complete confidentiality and
were paid $20 for their participation. The interviews, averag-
ing 55 minutes in length, were conducted in English or Span-
ish. Respondents who disclosed a situation of serious threat
or ongoing victimization were recontacted by a clinical mem-
ber of the research team, trained in telephone crisis counsel-
ing, whose responsibility was to stay in contact with the re-
spondent until the situation was appropriately addressed
locally.
Response Rates
Averagedacrosscollectionmodalities,thecooperationratewas
60%, and the response rate was 40.4%. These are good rates
by current survey research standards23-25 given the steady de-
clines in response rates that have occurred during the past 3
decades26 andtheparticularmarkeddropinrecentyears.24,27,28
Although the potential for response bias remains an impor-
tant consideration, several recent studies29-32 have shown no
meaningful association between response rates and re-
sponse bias.
Measurement
This survey used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victim-
ization Questionnaire. This instrument obtains an inventory
of childhood victimization.33-35
The enhanced version of the Juvenile Victimization Ques-
tionnaire obtained reports on 54 forms of offenses against
youth that cover the following 6 general areas of concern:
sexual assault, child maltreatment, conventional crime, In-
ternet victimization, peer and sibling victimization, and wit-
nessing and indirect victimization. Follow-up questions for
each screening item gathered additional information, includ-
ing the use of a weapon and perpetrator characteristics, as well
as whether injury resulted and whether the event occurred in
conjunction with another screening event. Because different
kinds of victimizations can occur together and can overlap by
definition (eg, physical abuse by a caretaker can also be an as-
sault with or without injury), rates reported for victimiza-
tions in this article reflect considerable rescoring of these data
provided by the screening items and follow-up questions. Spe-
cific screening items reflecting the 54 types of events are given
in eAppendix 1, and definitions of the rescored victimiza-
tions and aggregates are given in eAppendix 2 (Supplement).
The survey instrument used in the NatSCEV II included
several new screening items that were not included in the
NatSCEV I in 2008. Rates shown for the NatSCEV II reflect the
incorporation of the new screening information in rates; how-
ever, comparisons of rates with 2008 were based only on data
from screening items that were used in both surveys.
Data Analysis Weighting
The weighting plan for the survey was a multistage sequen-
tial process of weighting the sample to correct for study de-
sign and demographic variations in nonresponse. Specifi-
cally, weights were applied to adjust for (1) differing
probabilitiesofhouseholdselectionbasedonsamplingframes,
(2) variations in within-household selection resulting from dif-
ferent numbers of eligible children across households, and (3)
differences in sample proportions according to sex, age, in-
come, census region, race/ethnicity, number of adults and chil-
dren in the household, and telephone status (cell only, mostly
cell, or other) relative to the 2010 American Community Sur-
vey Public Use Microdata Sample.
Results
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 give the exposure rates for 5 major do-
mains, including assaults and bullying, sexual victimization,
maltreatment by a caregiver, property victimization, and wit-
nessing victimization. Each table summarizes rates of expo-
sure for the last year in total and broken down by sex and age.
They also give rates of lifetime exposure in total, by sex, and

for those aged 14 to 17 years. Finally, they list changes in cur-
rent rates compared with the NatSCEV I (2008) rates.
Assault
Two of 5 children (41.2%) were physically assaulted during the
last year (Table 1). One in 10 children (10.1%) was injured. Sib-
lings and nonsibling peers were common perpetrators. Also
common were physical intimidation (13.7%) and relational ag-
gression (36.5%), terminology we use instead of the more com-
mon terms of physical and emotional bullying, which in their
technical definition require a "power imbalance" in the rela-
tionship between victim and perpetrator. Some specific kinds
of assaults occurred in smaller groups of youth, including bias
attack to 1.8%, assault by gang or group to 1.7%, attempted or
completed kidnapping to 0.6%, and dating violence to 3.2% of
youtholderthan12years.Boysexperiencedmoreassaultsover-
all(45.2%vs37.1%forgirls).Comparedwithgirls,boyshadpar-
ticularly disproportionate levels of assault with injury (13.0%
vs 7.1%), assault by gang or group (2.5% vs 0.9%), and non-
sexual assault to the genitals (9.3% vs 1.0%). Compared with
boys, girls were targets of more dating violence (4.7% vs 1.9%).
Assault with injury, dating violence, and nonsexual assault to
the genitals were higher among the oldest youth (those aged
14-17 years). Assault by peer tended to be most common dur-
ing middle childhood.
Bullying-type victimizations are summarized in Table 1.
Relational aggression and Internet or cell phone harassment
werehigherforgirls.Physicalintimidationwashighestforchil-
drenyoungerthan10years,andrelationalaggressionwashigh-
est for those aged 6 to 9 years. Internet or cell phone harass-
ment was highest for those aged 14 to 17 years.
The overall estimate for assault in 2011 was down 2.2 per-
centage points compared with 2008, and most specific forms
of assault also showed declines. However, except for the de-
clineinlifetimeexposuretosiblingassault,noneofthechanges
in assault from 2008 to 2011 were statistically significant.
Sexual Assault
Almost 6% (5.6%) of the total sample experienced a sexual vic-
timization in the last year, and 2.2% experienced a sexual as-
sault (Table 2). (Sexual assault excludes sexual harassment and
includes attempted and completed rape, plus contact sex of-
fenses by adults and peers. It is equivalent to contact sexual
abuse.) Rates were considerably higher for girls aged 14 to 17
years (the highest-risk group), 22.8% of whom experienced a
sexual victimization and 10.7% of whom experienced a sexual
assault in the last year. Among this group, 8.1% had reported
an attempted or completed rape, 13.6% experienced sexual ha-
rassment, and 12.9% were exposed to an unwanted Internet
sexual solicitation in the last year.
There is considerable focus in the literature on the life-
time risk of sexual assault and victimization. The NatSCEV II
lifetime estimates for youth aged 14 to 17 years (who have al-
most completed childhood) by sex are given in Table 2: 17.4%

of the older girls and 4.2% of the older boys said they had ex-
perienced a sexual assault during childhood. Completed rape
occurred in 3.6% of girls and 0.4% of boys. Sexual assault by a
known adult occurred in 5.9% of girls and 0.3% of boys. Sexual
assault by an unknown adult occurred in 3.8% of girls and 0.1%
of boys. One category of sexual victimization, peer flashing,
saw a significant decline since 2008.
Child Maltreatment
Any child maltreatment (summarized in Table 3) included ne-
glect, physical abuse, emotional abuse, custodial interfer-
ence, and sexual abuse by a known adult; overall, 13.8% of the
sample experienced such maltreatment in the last year. The
lifetime rate of child maltreatment for the oldest subgroup was
41.2%. Emotional abuse by a caregiver was the most fre-
quent, with the last-year rate being 8.0% for the total sample

abuse, with boys experiencing somewhat higher rates (4.5%
vs 2.9% for girls). Rates of physical abuse and emotional abuse
were significantly higher for older children. There were no sig-
nificant trends in child maltreatment from 2008 to 2011.
Property Victimization
Property victimization (Table 4), consisting of robbery, van-
dalism, and theft, occurred in 24.1% of children and youth dur-
ing the last year. Vandalism was more common for boys (8.7%
vs 4.8% for girls). Theft was more common among older youth.
Property victimization as a whole and robbery specifically de-
clined significantly since 2008.
Indirect Victimization
Almost one-quarter of the sample (22.4%) had witnessed vio-
lenceinthelastyearinthefamilyorinthecommunity(Table5).
In total, 8.2% had witnessed a family assault, and 6.1% had wit-
nessed a parent assault another parent (or parental partner) in
the last year. The lifetime rate of witnessing any family as-
sault among the oldest youth was 34.5%, and 28.3% had wit-
nessed an interparental assault in their lifetimes. There were
few significant sex or age differences in the witnessing of fam-
ily assaults.
In the case of witnessing a community assault (Table 5),
rates for all children and youth were 16.9% in the last year and
58.9% over the lifetime of the oldest youth. Lifetime expo-
sure to shooting was 16.8% for this oldest group of youth, but
exposure to warfare was only 2.0%. In total, 7.9% of all chil-
dren and youth had been exposed to household theft in the
last year, and 3.7% had experienced a bomb threat in their
school. Last-year and lifetime exposure to bomb threats sig-
nificantly declined since 2008.

Multiple Exposures
Overall, 57.7% of the children and youth had experienced or
witnessed at least 1 of 5 aggregate exposures (assaults and bul-
lying, sexual victimization, maltreatment by a caregiver, prop-
erty victimization, or witnessing victimization) in the year be-
fore this survey. It was also common to have had multiple
exposures. In total, 48.4% had more than 1 of 50 possible spe-
cific victimization types involving direct or witnessed victim-
ization; 15.1% had 6 or more, and 4.9% had 10 or more.
Exposure to one type increased the likelihood that a child
or youth had exposures to other types as well. As summa-
rized in Table 6, in most cases risk for an additional type of ex-
posure was increased by a factor of 2 or 3 for a last-year expo-
sure and somewhat more for a lifetime exposure. For example,
havingalast-yearassaultwasassociatedwitha2.7timeshigher
likelihood of sexual victimization and a 2.9 times higher like-
lihood of caregiver maltreatment. There were no combina-
tions for which this risk amplification did not occur.
Trends Summary
Ratesreportedhereinfrom2011havebeencomparedwithrates
from 2008, the year of the first NatSCEV, which was also based
on a nationally representative sample of children and youth
aged 1 month to 17 years.13 Comparisons are shown in Tables 1
through 5. The comparisons for 5 aggregate types of exposure
(assaults and bullying, sexual victimization, maltreatment by
a caregiver, property victimization, and witnessing victimiza-
tion) suggest more stability than change. The percentage ex-
periencing any of the 5 direct and witnessed aggregate types
in the last year fell by 2.3 percentage points, but the change was
not significant. Among the specific types of exposures, de-
clines somewhat outnumbered increases, but there were only
6 types for which decreases reached significance during the
last year or the lifetime. Assault by juvenile siblings (lifetime)
declined, school bomb threats (last year and lifetime) de-
clined,propertyvictimization(lastyear)androbbery(lastyear)
declined, and flashing by a peer and statutory sex offense (last
year and lifetime) declined.
Discussion
This study reinforces numerous previous studies37-39 show-
ing that children and youth are frequently exposed to vio-
lence, crime, and abuse on an annual basis and over the course
of their childhoods. However, what is unique about the
NatSCEV is its ability to provide more precise epidemiology for
this exposure, breaking it down by various distinct and some-
times overlapping types, as well as by age and by last-year and
lifetime rates, to suit various needs. Researchers and policy-
makers who want to focus on the most serious exposures can
do so, but so can those who want a more comprehensive pic-
ture that aggregates across types.
Therefore, some may be most interested in the 10.1% of
children and youth who are injured by violence in the course
of a year or in those who were sexually assaulted by a known
adult (0.5% of children and youth for the last year and 3.0%
for the lifetime as reported by those aged 14 to 17 years). Oth-
ers may prefer a rate for a sample that includes all physical as-
saults(41.2%ofchildrenandyouthforthelastyear)orallsexual
assaults (2.2% of children and youth for the last year and 10.6%
for the lifetime of the older youth).
The comprehensiveness also allows an unusual perspec-
tive on the degree to which some children and youth experi-
ence multiple exposures and that seem to be highly corre-
lated. Eleven percent of youth in the sample had 6 or more
direct victimizations (excluding witnessing) in a single year, a
highly vulnerable segment of youth we have labeled as "poly-
victims," who appear prone to distress, many adversities, and
other problems.40,41

The NatSCEV model also allows researchers and policy-
makers to track trends over time and to monitor the possible
effects of social changes and public policies. Overall, more rate
changes from 2008 and 2011 moved down than up, but few of
the changes were large enough to be detectable as significant
with the sample sizes available. There were significant down-
ward trends in lifetime exposure to last-year peer flashing, ju-
venile sibling assault, last-year statutory sex crimes, last-year
and lifetime school bomb threats, and last-year robbery and
total property victimization. According to Federal Bureau of
Investigation statistics,42-44 the overall trends in crime as
tracked by reports to the police were down 4%, 6%, and 5% for
each successive year from 2008 to 2011. In general, the find-
ings reported herein seem consistent with these statistics, al-
though the size of our survey and the precision of estimates
are not great enough to reliably detect small changes. Per-
haps most noteworthy was that, in the context of continuing
widespread economic distress and high unemployment, there
were no signs of increased abuse, conflict, and aggression.
Limitations
Readers should also keep in mind several limitations of the
study. Various factors may have prevented us from capturing
the full extent of exposure. The families that could not be con-
tacted at home or who refused cooperation for themselves or
their children may be the families whose children have dis-
crepant levels of exposure compared with the cooperating
families.Childrenmayformanyreasonsfailtodisclosealltheir
exposures, and parents in particular may have incentive to
cover up their children's exposures. The screening questions
for exposures needed to be brief and may not have included
enough examples and details to trigger the memory of quali-
fying experiences. Some exposures, especially over a long time
span, may be forgotten or may have occurred before the
memory capacity of some victims was well formed. Some im-
portant types of victimization, like witnessing parental homi-
cide, occur too infrequently in the population to be ad-
equately counted in a survey method of this sort. Despite these
limitations, the approach taken by the NatSCEV is more de-
tailed and comprehensive than that used in previous vio-
lence exposure studies.
Implications
The high rate of exposure in children and youth and the com-
plexity and interrelationships among the types of exposure are
arguments for much more systematic, frequent, and inten-
sive efforts to monitor the epidemiology of these problems.
Despite the intense public attention focused on phenomena,
such as clergy abuse (as illustrated by the experience in the
Catholic church), coach abuse (as illustrated in the Penn State
case, University Park, Pennsylvania), and bullying (as illus-
trated by the suicide of Massachusetts high school student,
Phoebe Prince), it is remarkable that there have been no reli-
able, regular, validated data sources for tracking these prob-
lems. No annual surveys assess the frequency of bullying or
dating violence, no annual estimates are acquired on the total
number of child molestations, and no annual data are ob-
tained on the number of teachers or coaches who are investi-
gated for sex offenses against children. The NatSCEV points
to the feasibility of obtaining more coordinated and frequent
epidemiological data about these exposures.
This dearth of epidemiology stands in contrast to the situ-
ation in public health, in which accurate annual estimates are
provided for more than 60 diseases, some quite obscure.45
Population surveys track other health characteristics such as
insurancecoverageandtheprevalenceofasthmaandobesity.46
Crimes, such as auto theft and purse snatching, are tracked by
the National Crime Victimization Survey.47 Large gaps exist in
the coverage of children's exposure to violence and abuse.
Given its importance, priority should be given to filling these
gaps.
