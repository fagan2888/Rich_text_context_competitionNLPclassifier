WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS,
breast milk is the pre-
ferred feeding for in-
fants and confers unique
immunologic, growth, and develop-
mental benefits.1,2 Immunologic ben-
efit and reduction in risk for or sever-
ity of many acute and chronic diseases,
including diarrhea, lower respiratory
tract infections, urinary tract infec-
tions, otitis media, and asthma, have
been associated with exclusive breast-
feeding for at least 4 months.1-3 Shorter
and less intensive periods of breast-
feeding may be less protective. Cogni-
tive developmental scores for infants
who were fully breastfed for 6 months
or more are increased in comparison
with those scores of infants who were
never breastfed.4
There is some suggestion that breast-
feeding is also protective against the de-
velopment of overweight in young chil-
dren and adolescents.5,6 If breastfeeding
is protective against overweight in early
childhood, the explanation may lie less
in inherent obesity-preventing proper-
ties of breast milk than in the fact that
breastfeeding displaces potentially more
energy-dense formula-feeding. In ad-
dition, the higher protein/nitrogen con-
tent of infant formula compared with
breast milk may cause a metabolic re-
sponse of increased insulin and insulin-
like growth factor-1 secretion in for-
mula-fed infants leading to excessive
weight gain, or there may be differ-
ences in the regulation of intake of for-
mula-fed infants compared with breast-
fed infants.
Any protective mechanism of breast-
feeding is difficult to identify because
many of the same factors related to child
growth and the development of over-
weight, such as race/ethnicity, mater-
nal education, maternal size, and birth
weight, are also related to the initia-
tion and duration of breastfeeding or
the decision to formula-feed.7-11 Our ob-
jective was to determine if breastfeed-
ing and its duration are associated with
a reduced risk of overweight in a na-
tionally representative sample of young
US-born children.

Context It has been suggested that breastfeeding is protective against children be-
coming overweight, and that there is a dose-dependent effect of its duration.
Objective To determine whether breastfeeding and its duration are associated with
a reduced risk of being overweight among young children in the United States.
Design and Setting Data on infant feeding and child overweight status were taken
from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a cross-
sectional health examination survey conducted from 1988-1994.
Subjects Sample of 2685 US-born children between the ages of 3 and 5 years, with
birth certificates, height and weight measures, and information on infant feeding.
Main Outcome Measures A body mass index (BMI) between the 85th and 94th
percentile was considered at risk of overweight and a BMI in the 95th percentile or
higher was considered being overweight.
Results After adjusting for potential confounders, there was a reduced risk of being
at risk of overweight for ever breastfed children (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.63; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.96) compared with those never breastfed. There was
no reduced risk of being overweight (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.13). There was no
clear dose-dependent effect of the duration of full breastfeeding on being at risk of
overweight or overweight and no threshold effect. The strongest predictor of child
overweight status was the mother's concurrent weight. The rate of children being over-
weight nearly tripled with maternal overweight status (BMI, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2; AOR,
2.95; 95% CI, 1.35-6.42) and more than quadrupled with maternal obesity status (BMI
30.0 kg/m2; AOR, 4.34; 95% CI, 2.50-7.54).
Conclusions There are inconsistent associations among breastfeeding, its dura-
tion, and the risk of being overweight in young children. Breastfeeding continues to
be strongly recommended, but may not be as effective as moderating familial fac-
tors, such as dietary habits and physical activity, in preventing children from becom-
ing overweight.

METHODS
Design and Sample
Information on infant feeding and child
overweight status were taken from the
National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey III (NHANES III), a
cross-sectional survey conducted by
theNationalCenterforHealthStatistics/
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (NCHS/CDC) from 1988-
1994.12 As part of the stratified,
multistage probability design, infants
and children from ages 2 to 71 months
at interview, blacks, and Mexican-
Americans were oversampled. These
analyses focus on young children, 3
to 5 years (36-71 months) at inter-
view, for whom retrospective informa-
tion on infant feeding was obtained.
NHANES III included 3461 children,
ages 3 to 5 years, and 94.1% (n=3257)
were measured for height and weight.
Birth Certificates
Birth certificates were sought for
US-born children ages 6 years or
younger.13-15 For these analyses, 2879
birth certificates (94% of US-born chil-
dren ages 3-5 years) were linked to the
NHANES III file. Variables taken from
the birth certificates included sex, birth
plurality (singleton or twin), birth or-
der, birth weight (grams), and length
of gestation (weeks). As in previous
studies using the linked file,10,13-15 ges-
tational length from the mother's last
menstrual period was examined for
completeness and validity16-18; 235 sub-
jects (8.2%) were found to have miss-
ing or invalid length of gestation. For
those with valid gestational ages, pre-
term delivery was defined as less than
37 weeks and term as 37 weeks or more.
Birth-weight categories were de-
fined as low birth weight (2500 g),
normal (2500-3999 g), and high birth
weight (4000 g). Children with valid
gestational ages were categorized as
small (10th percentile of birth weight
for gestation), appropriate (10th-89th
percentile), and large for gestational age
(90th percentile), using reference per-
centiles derived separately for non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Mexican-American singleton
infants.18 Infants of "other" races/
ethnicities were categorized using the
reference for non-Hispanic whites.
Demographic and Maternal
Characteristics
Race/ethnicity and region of residence
were based on US Bureau of the Census
categories and definitions.12 The educa-
tion of the family reference person in
NHANES III was used to represent
household education level. The follow-
ing were taken from the questionnaire
administered to the child's parent or
otheradultcaretakerinthehome:moth-
er's age at the time of the child's birth,
smokingduringpregnancy,reportedcur-
rent weight and height, and whether the
infant received special neonatal care and
durationofthatcare.Sexwastakenfrom
NHANES III and checked for discrep-
ancies with the birth certificate. Moth-
er's weight and height were converted
intoabodymassindex(BMI,kg/m2),ex-
cept for 145 subjects who had missing
information. Maternal BMI was classi-
fiedasunderweight(18.5kg/m2),nor-
mal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), over-
weight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese
(30.0 kg/m2).19 In multivariate analy-
ses, the underweight and normal weight
women were combined as the reference
because only 88 women were classified
as underweight.
Infant Feeding
Questions on infant feeding practices
included whether the child was ever
breastfed and the age (converted into
months) when the child completely
stopped breastfeeding, was first fed
formula daily, completely stopped
drinking formula, was first fed milk
daily, and started eating solid foods
daily.12 Infant feeding was defined
based on the duration (in months)
that the children were fully breastfed
(no liquids daily other than breast
milk or water). Infants who were par-
tially breastfed (supplemented daily
with formula or milk) were no longer
considered fully breastfed once daily
supplementation with formula or milk
began. Feeding groups were classified
as never breastfed and fully breastfed
for 2 months or less, 3 to 5 months, 6
to 8 months, and 9 months or more.
Timing (in months) of the introduc-
tion of solid foods was considered
separately because timing of the intro-
duction of solids does not appear to
alter growth and body composition in
the first year of life.20,21
Child Weight Status
Body weight and height were mea-
sured using standard anthropometric
techniques.22,23 Body mass index was
calculated, and weight status was de-
fined using BMI-for-age percentiles
from the revised NCHS/CDC growth
charts.24 Body mass index and weight
status based on BMI-for-age were cho-
sen as the primary dependent vari-
ables because BMI is the worldwide
standard for screening for overweight
in children, it is based on highly reli-
ablemeasurements(heightandweight),
and even in early childhood BMI is
highly correlated with fatness.24-26
Twenty-nine children had missing
heights or weights. Following current
guidelines for children and adoles-
cents, a BMI between the 85th through
94th percentile was considered "at risk
of overweight" and at or above the 95th
percentile as overweight.24-26 Young
children generally are not designated
"obese," even at or above the 95th per-
centile of BMI-for-age, in the absence
of clinical evaluation. The 95th per-
centile corresponds to a BMI of 30.0 or
grade 2 obesity in adults.19
Other Exclusions
From the base sample of 2879 subjects
with interview, examination, and birth
certificate data, 76 twins and triplets
were excluded, as were cases missing
birth weight (n=5), sex (n=4), and in-
fant feeding (n=5). Twenty-nine chil-
drenbornvery low birthweight(1500
g) were excluded because they were not
sufficiently mature at birth to initiate
breastfeeding, and they remained small
through childhood. For the same rea-
son, 75 children with extended periods
(2weeks)ofspecialneonatalcarewere
excluded. The final analytic sample was
2685 subjects.

Statistical Methods
Following NCHS/CDC analytic guide-
lines, statistical sample weights for ex-
amined children were used (weighted)
to account both for the oversampling
and unit nonresponse.27 Both nonre-
sponse and poststratification adjust-
ments impose a great deal of hetero-
geneity into the weights, and thus
ignoring the sample weights in this case
would have imposed a bias in both the
prevalence estimates and in the esti-
mates of sampling error.
SUDAAN software, which incorpo-
rates the heterogeneity in survey weight
along with the clustering effects in sur-
vey design, was used for statistical
analysis and to estimate standard er-
rors (SEs).28 The effect of duration of
full breastfeeding (in months) on child
BMI was examined by multiple regres-
sion. The likelihood of being at risk of
overweight and overweight among fully
breastfed as compared with never
breastfed children was estimated us-
ing the SUDAAN MULTILOG proce-
dure. MULTILOG is an extension of tra-
ditional logistic regression with the
capability to model multiple level out-
comes. Using the MULTILOG proce-
dure, odds and adjusted odds ratios for
at risk of overweight and overweight
were estimated in the same model with
the normal BMI group ( 85th percen-
tile) as the reference. Possible con-
founding variables were selected for in-
clusion based on both forward selection
and backward deletion, with the deci-
sion to include or delete based on
changes in the significance and  val-
ues of the exposure effects (duration of
breastfeeding).29 In parallel, most analy-
ses were performed unweighted to con-
firm that the significance of the find-
ings was not affected by the variance
estimates used to account for the sample
design. The unweighted results were
not different and are not shown.

breastfed, nearly 25% were fully breast-
fed for 2 months or less, and then ap-
proximately 10% were fully breastfed
for 3 to 5 months, for 6 to 8 months,
and for 9 months or more. The timing
of introduction of solid foods was con-
sistent with the American Academy of
Pediatrics recommendations for in-
fant feeding1 for 4 to 6 months for only
about half the sample.
BMI and Childhood Weight Status
Using weighted estimates, 11% of the
US-born children were classified as be-
ing at risk of overweight and 8.2% as
overweight (TABLE 2). For females, but
not for males, there was a trend to-
ward increasing overweight from ages
3 to 5 years.

Moderately low birth weight infants
(1500-2499 g) were less likely and high
birth weight infants more likely to have
been breastfed. Infants who were in-
troduced to solids at the recom-
mended age (4-6 months) were more
likely to have been breastfed, but in-
fants for whom the introduction of sol-
ids was delayed beyond 6 months were
breastfed longer. Mother's concurrent
BMI was strongly related to infant feed-
ing. Underweight mothers breastfed for
a shorter duration compared with nor-
mal weight mothers. Over 50% of over-
weight and obese mothers did not
breastfeed at all (Table 3).
There was a reduction in the preva-
lence of being at risk of overweight if
ever breastfed, although the reduction
did not appear dose-dependent
(TABLE 4). The reduction in risk was
not significant in unadjusted analyses
(odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.44-1.00), but
there was a significant reduction in be-
ing at risk of overweight associated with
having ever been breastfed (AOR, 0.63;
95% CI, 0.41-0.96), adjusting for birth
weight status, race/ethnicity, sex, age
group, mother's BMI status, and the
timing of introduction of solid foods.
However, there was no clear dose-
dependent effect of duration of full
breastfeeding (Table 4) nor was there
a recognizable threshold effect of breast-
feeding. The AOR for being at risk of
overweight with full breastfeeding for
3 months or more was 0.67 (95% CI,
0.39-1.14), indistinguishable from the
AOR of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.34-1.29) for be-
ing at risk of overweight with full
breastfeeding for 6 months or more.
For overweight, there was no signifi-
cant reduction in being overweight with
being ever breastfed either in unad-
justed (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.09)
or in adjusted analyses (AOR, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.62-1.13). As in the case of being
at risk of overweight, for overweight sta-
tus there was neither a clear dose-
dependent effect with duration (Table
4) nor a threshold effect. The AOR of
being overweight with full breastfeed-
ing for 3 months or more was 0.70 (95%
CI, 0.39-1.25), again indistinguish-
able from the AOR of 0.70 (95% CI,
0.37-1.32) for full breastfeeding for 6
months or more.
The lack of strong association be-
tween duration of full breastfeeding and
child BMI was confirmed in a linear
multiple regression model using dura-
tion of full breastfeeding (in months)
to predict child BMI, adjusting for the
race/ethnicity, sex, age group, birth
weight status, mother's BMI, and tim-
ing (in months) of introduction of solid
foods. There was a slight reduction in
child BMI with duration of full breast-
feeding (-0.02±0.01 kg/m2 per month
full breastfeeding), but it was not sta-
tistically significant (P=.20).
However, there were factors that were
significantly associated with child
overweight in the multiple logistic re-
gression models. Compared with non-
Hispanic white children, Mexican-
American children were at significantly
increased risk of overweight (AOR,
1.76; 95% CI, 1.05-2.94). The timing
of introduction of solid foods was as-
sociated with a 0.1% reduction in risk
of overweight (AOR, 0.9994; 95% CI,
0.9990-0.9997) for each month that the
introduction of solids was delayed
(P.001).
By far the strongest predictor of child
BMI status was mother's concurrent
BMI (TABLE 5). Children were at mod-
erately increased risk for being at risk
of overweight with an overweight
mother (AOR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.93-
2.57) but nearly 3 times more likely to
be at risk of overweight with maternal
obesity (AOR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.88-4.69).
Furthermore, overweight in early child-
hood was nearly 3-fold greater (AOR,

COMMENT
We found a significant 37% reduction in
being at risk of overweight (BMI 85th-
94th percentile) among children ever
breastfedcomparedwiththosewhowere
never breastfed but only a 16% reduc-
tion in overweight (95th percentile).
There was no strong dose-dependent ef-
fect of the duration of full breastfeeding
on overweight status in early child-
hood, nor was there an apparent thresh-
oldeffect,thatis,areductioninriskwith
full breastfeeding for 3 months or more
or for 6 months or more. Children fully
breastfed for 3 months or longer were at
about a 30% decreased risk for over-
weight,buttheCIsfortheestimateswere
wideandincludedunity.Durationoffull
breastfeeding as an independent vari-
able showed only a weak linear associa-
tion with child BMI.
Our results are in contrast to the find-
ings of von Kries et al,5 who reported a
clear dose-dependent effect for dura-
tion of exclusive breastfeeding (de-
fined as the child having been fed "no
food" other than breast milk) on the
prevalence of "obesity" (97th per-
centile for BMI) in Bavarian children at
ages 5 to 6 years. However, the cur-
rent recommendation is to allow
supplementation with solids by 4 to 6
months, while continuing full breast-
feeding for 12 months or more. The
findings of von Kries et al5 may be at-
tributed to reverse causality, that is, the
Bavarian children who were exclu-
sively breastfed for 6 months or longer
were smaller as infants, able to be nu-
tritionally supported on breast milk
alone longer, and were therefore less
likely to be at risk of overweight or to
be overweight in early childhood.
Our findings are less likely to be at-
tributable to such reverse causality, and
the study has additional strengths. The
nationally representative sample of US-
born young children is ethnically di-
verse, and the findings for breastfeed-
ing are consistent both with prevalence
data and with demographic associa-
tions reported in other national stud-
ies.7-9 Our conclusions therefore are less
likely due to chance or sample bias, al-
though neither explanation can be to-
tally ruled out. Having excluded in-
fants born weighing less than 1500 g
or with extended periods ( 2 weeks)
of special neonatal care, we were able
to adjust for the effects of both mod-
erately low (1500-2499 g) and high
birth weight, since both have been
shown to be associated with early child-
hood growth in NHANES III.10,13-15 By
not limiting our definition of breast-
feeding to those exclusively breastfed
and allowing the introduction of sol-
ids at the recommended ages, we were
better able to determine if there were
inherent overweight-preventing prop-
erties of breastfeeding, as compared
with lesser weight gain from a lower en-
ergy intake.
Basing the duration of breastfeed-
ing on mother's recall is a limitation of
this study. However, studies of the re-
liability of recalling infant feeding mode
and duration have shown that, if any-
thing, more highly educated mothers
tend to overestimate the duration of full
breastfeeding.2,30 This would have the
effect of exaggerating the beneficial ef-
fects of breastfeeding on child over-
weight since children born to more
highly educated parents tend to be
healthier, better nourished, and leaner.
It is unlikely, therefore, that recall bias
is masking an association between
breastfeeding and early childhood over-
weight.
We did find that factors other than in-
fant feeding were associated with child
overweight, implying that the associa-
tion between breastfeeding and being at
risk of overweight may be confounded
byunmeasuredsociodemographicorin-
tervening familial factors. Compared
with non-Hispanic white children,
youngMexican-Americanchildrenwere
at significantly increased risk of over-
weight, a finding that has been re-
ported previously for NHANES III.11,15
The timing of the introduction of solid
foods was associated significantly with
a 0.1% reduction in risk of overweight
for each month that introduction of sol-
ids was delayed. For half of the sample,
timingofintroductionofsolidfoodswas
consistent with American Academy of
Pediatrics recommendations of 4 to 6
months.1 A further delay in introduc-
tion of solid foods in infancy would ap-
pear to provide a statistically signifi-
cant but relatively minor reduction in
risk for overweight at ages 3 to 5 years.
Mehta et al20 have reported that early
(3-4 months), as compared with late
(6months),introductionofsolidfoods
did not affect infant growth or body
composition in the first year of life and
concluded that early introduction of
solid foods in infancy simply displaced
energyintakefromliquidsources(breast
milk or formula), rather than supply-
ing additional energy that would con-
tribute to overweight.
By far the strongest predictor of BMI
status in young children was mother's
concurrent BMI. Risk of overweight
among young children was nearly
tripled with maternal overweight and
more than quadrupled with mothers'
obesity. The overwhelming signifi-
cance of the association between pa-
rental obesity and overweight status in
children younger than 5 years has also
been demonstrated.31 It was shown that
risk among children ages 3 to 5 years
of subsequently becoming obese as
adults was nearly tripled for those with
obese mothers compared with risk
among children whose mothers were
not obese, although overweight in early
childhood is not by itself a strong pre-
dictor of adult obesity. The extent to
which familial tendencies to obesity are
genetic or associated with shared di-
etary and activity habits has yet to be
determined, but it is unlikely that
breastfeeding alone would be suffi-
cient to prevent the development of
overweight in such a situation.
Our findings therefore agree with
previous studies that have failed to find
an association between mode of infant
feeding and body composition in early
childhood10,21 or overweight, but have
implicated maternal or parental obe-
sity.32-35 For example, Baranowski et al32

nic groups that no measure of infant
feeding (breastfeeding or duration) was
associated with adiposity at 3 to 4 years
of age. Likewise, Zive et al33 found no
relationship between duration of breast-
feeding and adiposity, as measured by
BMI, for 331 children at 4 years of age.
However, as we found in this study,
Zive et al33 found that mother's BMI ex-
plained the largest portion of the vari-
ance in child fatness.
Our study is best compared with that
of O'Callaghan et al34 who reported in
a large study of 4062 children at age 5
years that birth weight, paternal BMI,
and sleeplessness at 6 months pre-
dicted risk of being at risk of over-
weight (BMI 85th-94th percentile),
while birth weight, being female, and
maternal and paternal BMI predicted in-
creased risk of overweight (95th
percentile). On the other hand, whereas
birth weight and parental BMI were
strongly associated with risk of over-
weight, breastfeeding and its duration
were not.34 We also found that a high
birth weight (4000 g) was associated
with an increased risk of having a high
BMI in early childhood (85th percen-
tile),buttheeffectwasdiminishedwhen
maternal BMI was considered.
Between infancyand ages 3to5years,
patternsoffoodconsumptionandphysi-
cal activity probably have more impact
on weight status in early childhood than
infant feeding. Because the NHANES III
is a cross-sectional survey, no data are
available to describe relevant behav-
iors during this intervening period or to
characterizethetimingorrelativeweight
levelatwhichtheadiposityreboundmay
be occurring. Children who reach the
nadir of their BMI at ages younger than
6 years before it once again increases
tend to be at increased risk for over-
weight.36,37 A limitation of cross-
sectional survey data is that the contri-
bution of these time-dependent patterns
to the development of overweight can-
not be evaluated.
Overweight in early childhood is a
growing problem in the United States.
Recent findings from NHANES III
(1988-1994), compared with earlier na-
tional surveys,11,15 demonstrated that
children as young as 4 or 5 years, and
especially females and Mexican-
Americans, show an increased preva-
lence of overweight. Mei et al38 have
documented an increasing trend in
overweight among low-income chil-
dren aged 5 years or younger who were
included in the CDC Pediatric Nutri-
tion Surveillance System from 1983 to
1995. Consistent with our findings, Mei
et al38 also observed that overweight
prevalence was higher for young fe-
males than for males, a trend that
emerges as early as the preschool years
and persists into adulthood. In this con-
text, the suggestion that breastfeeding
may be protective against the develop-
ment of overweight in children5,6 has
raised expectations that promoting
breastfeeding might help reverse this
trend.
The findings from our analyses of US
national survey data do not support the
contention that breastfeeding and its
duration are necessarily protective
against early childhood overweight, al-
though there is some conferred protec-
tion from being at risk of overweight.
However, maternal obesity (suggest-
ing shared familial dietary habits and
activity patterns) far supersedes in-
fant feeding as a risk factor for being
at risk of overweight or overweight in
early childhood, and the dose-
dependent effect for duration of breast-
feeding and risk for overweight is in-
consistent compared with that for
maternal obesity. The finding that over-
weight and obese mothers were less
likely to have breastfed at all may sug-
gest a synergisticeffectofmaternalover-
weight status, combined with the ab-
sence of breastfeeding, that results in
increased risk for overweight in the chil-
dren of these mothers.
It cannot be too strongly empha-
sized that breastfeeding has numer-
ous attributes that render it the pre-
ferred feeding choice for almost all
infants. However, duration of full
breastfeeding does not appear to be pre-
dictive of or necessarily have preven-
tive properties for overweight in early
childhood, and encouraging breast-
feeding for overweight prevention
would not be as effective as moderat-
ing familial factors in preventing early
childhood overweight.
