Introduction
Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), an enzyme functioning as a cellular sensor of low
energy, promotes adaptive changes in metabolism.1,2 It works
mainly in terms of activation in response to an increasing
AMP/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio, improving sur-
vival under metabolic stress.3 The activation of AMPK in
vivo is complex and varies according to the magnitude and
type of the stress as well as the organ studied.4 The AMPK
system plays an important role in both heart and liver,5 which
are known as important organs involved in the stress
response. However, it is necessary to clarify the tissue-spe-
cific and stress-specific activation mechanism of AMPK
activation.6
It has been suggested that the renin-angiotensin system
may play a significant role in regulating the AMPK system.7

Abstract
Introduction: adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a prominent role as a metabolic stress
sensor, and it has recently been suggested that the renin-angiotensin system, in addition to its role in stress regulation, may
play a significant role in regulating the AMPK system. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of candesartan, an angiotensin
II receptor blocker, on cardiac and hepatic AMPK activity basally as well as after surgical stress under general anesthesia.
Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats were treated with 5 mg/kg/day candesartan in their drinking water for two
weeks. Levels of cardiac and hepatic AMPK activity were determined, using a kinase activity assay, basally and after surgi-
cal stress under general anesthesia.
Results: Chronic administration of candesartan increased hepatic AMPK activity approximately 4 times (p<0.05) while
no significant change was demonstrated in cardiac AMPK. Cardiac and hepatic AMPK activities were not significantly
increased by surgical stress alone performed under anesthesia. However, chronic treatment with candesartan decreased
AMPK activity in both liver and heart after surgical stress under anesthesia (p<0.01 for both comparisons).
Conclusions: While chronic candesartan treatment may stimulate AMPK activity in certain organs such as the liver,
when combined with surgical stress under anesthesia it inhibits pathways regulating AMPK activity.

perioperative medicine has increased,10 although the role of
these agents in surgical practice has not been fully eluci-
dated. While AMPK has been extensively studied in terms
of its response to metabolic fuel deprivation,11 very few
studies are available on the in vivo modifications of AMPK
responses to such a common stress scenario as laparotomy.
We have recently shown that basal hypothalamic AMPK is
upregulated by theARB candesartan, although it was dimin-
ished in candesartan-treated animals submitted to surgical
stress under anesthesia.12
We have therefore sought to evaluate cardiac and hepatic
AMPK activities under basal conditions and in response to
the surgical stress of laparotomy in anesthetized rats chron-
ically treated with candesartan in order to assess the pattern
of AMPK activity response in the heart and the liver.
Material and methods
Animals
Male Wistar rats of 7­9 weeks of age (provided by the
Federal University of Minas Gerais Medical SchoolAnimal
Facility) were maintained under temperature-controlled
conditions (25±2
°C) with an artificial 12-hour light-dark
cycle, with lights on from 07:00­19:00, and allowed stand-
ard chow and water ad libitum. Rats were housed in indi-
vidual cages and were handled daily.
A total of 28 animals were treated either with candesar-
tan cilexetil (AstraZeneca, Cotia, Brazil) 5 mg/kg/day in
the drinking water for two weeks (n=14) or no additions
(vehicle, n=14) for the same period in their drinking water
for two weeks utilizing metered drinking bottles with air-
holes according to a well-established protocol13,14 for glu-
cose and AMPK measurements. The University Ethics
Committee for Animal Experimentation approved all pro-
cedures (Protocol No. 110/2007).
Experimental design
Following the two-week treatment with candesartan, rats
were transferred in the early morning on the day of the
experiment to the temperature-controlled experimental
room and were left to rest for 60 min in their home cages.
Noise was kept at a minimum. Experiments were performed
from 08:00­12:00, and the animals had no access to water
or food during the experiments.
Experiment animals were then anesthetized with 0.075
mg/g intraperitoneal ketamine (Cristália, Itapira, Brazil)
and 0.01 mg/g xylazine (Schering-Plough Coopers, Cotia,
Brazil) according to the protocol of the local Ethics
Committee for Animal Research. This drug combination
was suggested by the local Ethics Committee to induce a
non-inhaled general anesthesia. After an average of 5 min,
when rats were deeply anesthetized, a median laparotomy
was performed, followed by evisceration and exposure of
the bowels for 20 min15 with exposed tissues kept warm
and moist.
Non-stressed animals and those after 20 min of stress
were moved to an adjacent room where they were killed by
decapitation without anesthesia, followed by immediate
removal of liver and heart. The organs were then placed in
liquid nitrogen and stored at ­80°C. Blood from the trunk
was collected in sodium citrate 6% syringes and kept in ice
until centrifugation (900 g, 20 min, 4°C). Plasma was then
stored for subsequent glucose measurements.
Assays
The AMPK activity of the heart and liver tissues were evalu-
ated at both baseline and after 20 min of surgical stress. We
have chosen to evaluate AMPK activity after 20 min of stress
based on our and others'previous experience showing a stress
peak, as evaluated by the hyperglycemic response, at around
20 min.15­18 Heart and liver of rats were weighed and homog-
enized with Precellys 24 using CK14 tubes containing
ceramic beads (Stretton Scientific, Stretton, UK) at 3600 g
for one cycle of 20 s in lysis buffer containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1 mM
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 250 mM sucrose,
1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM benza-
midine, 0.1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml
soybean trypsin inhibitor. Tissue protein content was deter-
mined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce,
Rockford, USA). AMPK activity was assayed as previously
described:19 briefly, AMPK was immunoprecipitated with an
equal mixture of 1AMPK and 2AMPK antibodies,19 and
AMPK activity was determined by the entity of phosphorylation
of SAMS (amino acid sequence: HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR,
Pepceuticals Ltd., Nottingham, UK), a synthetic peptide sub-
strate of AMPK.19 AMPK activity was calculated using the
difference of the counts between SAMS containing and
SAMS negative samples and expressed as nanomoles of ATP
incorporated per minute per milligram of sample of peptide.
The sensitivity of the AMPK assay was 5 pmol/ATP/min/mg
protein with an intra- and inter- assay coefficients of variation
of 10% and 15%, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
Conover-Inman comparison) were performed for AMPK
measurements, as these data were not normally distributed
(Kolmogorov­Smirnov test). StatsDirect (Addison Wesley
Longman, Cambridge, UK) and GraphPad Prism4 (San
Diego, California, USA) were utilized for statistical analy-
sis. All data are expressed as means ± standard error of the
mean (SEM), and significance was taken at p<0.05.
Results
There was no difference between the two-week fluid intake
of animals who on the day of the stress tests were assigned
to stress or to control groups, suggesting that they had
Ribeiro-Oliveira et al. 483
equal exposure to candesartan. There were no significant dif-
ferences in plasma glucose levels as related to candesartan
treatment when compared to respective non-stressed or
stressed controls, as appropriate. Marked hyperglycemia as
an index of sympathetic discharge was shown in surgically
stressed animals utilized in this study.12
Cardiac AMPK
After two weeks of candesartan treatment, there was no sig-
nificant change in cardiac AMPK activity in candesartan-
treated non-stressed rats when compared to the
vehicle-treated non-stressed controls (Figure 1).
After 20 min of surgical stress under general anesthesia,
no significant change could be observed in cardiac AMPK
in the vehicle-treated stressed animals when compared to
thenon-stressedcontrolgroup(0.018±0.001vs0.018±0.003
nmol/min/mg). However, there was a significant decrease
in cardiac AMPK levels in candesartan-treated anesthesia-
stressed animals when compared to the other groups
(0.010±0.002 vs 0.023±0.003 nmol/min/mg, p<0.01 for
comparison with candesartan-treated non-stressed animals;
0.010±0.002 vs 0.018±0.003 and 0.010±0.002 vs
0.018±0.001 nmol/min/mg, p<0.05 for comparisons with
vehicle-treated non-stressed animals and with no-candesartan
stressed animals, respectively; Figure 1). These data sug-
gest that the surgical stress of laparotomy under general
anesthesia is not associated with a stress-induced increase
in cardiac AMPK activity. However, the combination of
candesartan and laparotomy with anesthesia inhibitsAMPK
activity levels.
Hepatic AMPK
In the liver, two weeks candesartan treatment increased
hepatic AMPK activity levels (0.045±0.011 vs 0.013±0.003
nmol/min/mg, p<0.05, Figure 2).After 20 min surgical stress
under general anesthesia, there was a non-significant increase
in hepatic AMPK in vehicle-treated stressed animals when
compared to the non-stressed control group (0.029±0.007 vs
0.013±0.003 nmol/min/mg, p>0.05, Figure 2).
However, there was a significant decrease in hepatic
AMPK activity levels in the candesartan-treated anesthe-
sia-stressed group when compared to both the candesartan-
treated non-stressed group (0.014±0.010 vs 0.045±0.011
nmol/min/mg, p<0.01, Figure 2) and the vehicle-treated
stressed animals (0.014±0.010 vs 0.029±0.007 nmol/min/
mg, p<0.05, Figure 2). These data show that the stress of
laparotomy under general anesthesia (surgical stress) does
not significantly change hepatic AMPK activity. However,
when the same surgical stress is combined with candesartan
it restores hepatic AMPK activity to values which are simi-
lar to non-stressed controls, suggesting that inhibitory
AMPK pathways are switched on by this stress which can
overcome the effects of candesartan upon hepatic AMPK
activity observed on basal values.
Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that chronic candesar-
tan treatment stimulates hepatic AMPK activity in non-
stressed animals. Cardiac AMPK levels are not changed by
chronic candesartan treatment. We have also shown that
cardiac and hepatic AMPK are not changed significantly
by surgical stress under general anesthesia, suggesting that
the stress-anesthesia procedure inhibits pathways which
we might anticipate should lead to a stress-induced
increase in AMPK activity. However, when candesartan
is combined with anesthesia and surgical stress, other
mechanisms seems to be switched on: the ARB blocks the
antiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1)-mediated effects of
stress-induced angiotensin II release,20 thus preventing
stress-increases of both cardiac and hepatic AMPK, as
demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells.21
Consequently, chronic treatment with candesartan in com-
bination with the inhibitory actions on AMPK of both

anesthetics and stress-induced hyperglycemia inhibits
AMPK activity levels after surgical stress in both heart and
liver (Figure 3).
AMPK is a stress-activated protein kinase that works as
metabolic sensor of cellular ATP levels.1 AMPK not only
senses energy status, but it also functions at the tissue and
whole organism level to promote context-specific responses
to physiological signals of metabolic status in response to
ATP depletion and related stimuli. Several stress stimuli,
such as exercise, anoxia and myocardial ischemia, have
been described as activators of AMPK.22
This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to
identify the changes of cardiac and hepatic AMPK in the
surgical stress of laparotomy.ARBs are widely used in clin-
ical medicine, but very little is known regarding their
effects on the AMPK system.23 We have shown here that
candesartan significantly increases hepatic AMPK activity
in non-stressed animals, while surgical stress under anes-
thesia does not significantly change hepatic or cardiac
AMPK activity. We have further addressed the in vivo com-
plex interaction of candesartan, anesthetics and the hyper-
glycemic response in surgical stress, demonstrating that
this combination ultimately shuts down cardiac and hepatic
AMPK activity levels.
The AMPK system plays a major role in the regulation of
hepatic and lipid metabolism through its acute effects on
energy metabolism and long-term effects on gene expression
pattern in the liver.24 Candesartan has been otherwise shown
to increase the expression of peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-) and adiponectin,25
which are both known to increase hepatic AMPK activ-
ity.26­28 Therefore, both PPAR- agonism and the effect on
adiponectin might have contributed to the observed increase
on basal hepatic AMPK activity.25,29,30 In addition, as cande-
sartan not only reduces the actions of angiotensin II, but also
increases angiotensin-(1­7), we might also speculate that the
alternative renin angiotensin system axis formed by angio-
tensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2)-angiotensin-(1­7)/
Mas receptor could play a role in hepatic AMPK activation.
Likewise, we have recently shown that candesartan stimu-
lates the hypothalamic AMPK system, and others have
shown that anotherARB, telmisartan, acts on skeletal muscle
through activation of the PPAR/AMPK pathway.23
Activation of hepatic AMPK causes a switch from an
anabolic to a catabolic state and entails positive metabolic
consequences such as inhibition of hepatic glucose produc-
tion with restoration of blood glucose levels and regulation
of cellular lipid metabolism through stimulation of fatty

acid oxidation. Indeed, our findings of elevated basal
hepatic AMPK levels in candesartan-treated animals are in
agreement with possible beneficial effects of ARB on
metabolism, pointing to an anti-steatotic effect in the liver.31
However, despite the well-known protective effects of can-
desartan in the heart,32 we did not detect in this study a
significant elevation in cardiac AMPK activity of rats
chronically treated with candesartan. Similarly, a recent
study showed that activation of intrinsic cardiac ACE2 pro-
tects the heart against diabetes-induced dysfunction with-
out significant changes in AMPK expression.33
Interestingly, surgical stress under general anesthesia
did not significantly change cardiac and hepatic AMPK
activity. Indeed, general anesthesia reduces overall metabo-
lism sparing AMPK, thus precluding stress-increases of
AMPK in cardiac and hepatic cells as it turns off regulatory
AMPK pathways. Likewise, we recently demonstrated the
absence of significant changes in AMPK after surgical
stress under this same anesthetic protocol for hypothalamic
cells.12 The role of anesthesia is further corroborated by a
significant increase in hypothalamic AMPK activity after
restraint, when anesthesia is not utilised.12
The 2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine utilized in these
experiments acts centrally to decrease efferent sympathetic
activity and circulating noradrenaline concentrations, thus
preservingenergyconsumptionintheperiphery.34 Ketamine,
an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, has been
recently demonstrated to lower brain AMPK activity when
administered to rats before ischemia.35 Thus, the anesthetic
combination of ketamine and xylazine may have prevented
a significant increase in AMPK due to surgical stress.
However, these data may also be related to the marked
hyperglycemia evoked by surgical stress under general
anesthesia, thus reducing AMPK activity.36
The role of AT1 receptors in the regulation of stress
responses have been previously investigated.20,37,38 The pro-
duction of circulating and local angiotensin II, as well as the
expression of AT1 receptors increase during stress,20 and the
peripheral administration of an AT1 receptor antagonist oth-
erwise blocks peripheral and brain AT1 receptors.39
Furthermore, AT1 receptor mediates nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase activa-
tion and increases reactive oxygene species (ROS) produc-
tion,40 which are known to upregulate AMPK.41 Importantly,
it has been demonstrated that the angiotensin II type I recep-
tor antagonist valsartan significantly inhibits angiotensin
II-induced AMPK activation in rat vascular smooth muscle
cells, strongly suggesting that angiotensin II-induced AMPK
activation is specifically AT1 receptor-dependent.21
Furthermore, these data pointed to an AMPK inhibition
effect on the proliferation signal induced by angiotensin II.
It has previously been demonstrated that the renin-
angiotensin system is activated in anesthetized, surgically
stressed rats.42 In this study, candesartan blocked the AT1
receptor, thus inhibiting angiotensin-II-induced AMPK acti-
vation. This effect, in combination with the inhibitory effects
of anesthetics and stress hyperglycemia, suppresses AMPK
activity in the heart and liver (Figure 3). Further studies
should address the molecular pathways as well as the signifi-
cance of these changes. Interestingly, a possible role for angi-
otensin-(1­7) may also be considered to explain the observed
changes in the candesartan-stressed group of animals. Our
preliminary data, using the same stress protocol in transgenic
rats over-expressing angiotensin-(1­7), suggest a reduction
in hepatic and cardiac AMPK in these stressed rats when
compared to the wild type (data not shown).
We have not included a group of rats with anesthesia
alone (without surgery), as we wished to demonstrate the
effects of combined anesthesia and surgery mirroring a
`real life' situation. However, as AMPK has been impli-
cated in a wide range of metabolic pathways, apparent par-
adoxes and conflicts may be brought about, especially
when utilizing an in vivo model.
In summary, this in vivo study shows that candesartan
stimulates basal hepatic AMPK activity but has no signifi-
cant effect on heart AMPK activity. It also shows that surgi-
cal stress under anesthesia is not associated with a
significant increase in cardiac and hepatic AMPK activity.
Furthermore, and in line with the fairly complex position of
AMPK as a regulatory system, two weeks' treatment with
candesartan down-regulated cardiac and hepatic AMPK
activity after surgical stress under anesthesia. These
changes may need to be considered in the clinical situation
where ARBs are in widespread use.
Conclusions
We show for the first time that chronic treatment with can-
desartan increases hepatic AMPK, while the combination
of candesartan with surgical stress under anesthesia inhibits
pathways regulating AMPK activity, suggesting a role of
candesartan in modulating cardiac and hepatic AMPK
activity in surgical stress under anesthesia.
