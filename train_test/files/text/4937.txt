Are Women's Mate Preferences for
Altruism Also Influenced by Physical
Attractiveness?
Daniel Farrelly1, Paul Clemson2, and Melissa Guthrie2
Abstract
Altruism plays a role in mate choice, particularly in women's preferences and in long-term (LT) relationships. The current study
analyzed how these preferences interacted with another important mate choice variable, physical attractiveness. Here, female
participants were presented with photographs of men of varying levels of physical attractiveness, alongside descriptions of them
behaving either altruistically or not in different scenarios. The results showed women preferred altruistic men, particularly in LT
relationships and that this interacted with physical attractiveness such that being both attractive and altruistic made a man more
desirable than just the sum of the two desirable parts. Also, being altruistic made low attractive men more desirable but only for
LT relationships. Finally, men who were just altruistic were rated more desirable than men who were just attractive, especially for
LT relationships. Overall, these findings are discussed in terms of the role of altruism in mate choice, particularly in LT rela-
tionships and directions of future research.

Introduction
The ``puzzle'' of altruism, as Darwin (1871) described it, has
received attention recently to explore whether sexual selection
can play a role in solving it. For example, a number of studies
have shown that individuals behave more altruistically with or
in the presence of potential mates (Farrelly, Lazarus, &
Roberts, 2007; Iredale, Van Vugt, & Dunbar, 2008; Tognetti,
Berticat, Raymond, & Faurie, 2012; Van Vugt & Iredale,
2013). Similarly, other research has provided evidence that
individuals, in particular women, show a preference for part-
ners who are altruistic (Barclay, 2010; Farrelly, 2011, 2013;
Moore et al., 2013; Oda, Shibata, Kiyonari, Takeda, &
Matsumoto-Oda, 2013; Phillips, Barnard, Ferguson, & Reader,
2008; Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2015).
Furthermore, previous research has sought to identify what
qualities altruism may be signaling that makes it desirable in a
potential mate. Both Farrelly (2011) and Oda, Okuda, Takeda,
and Hiraishi (2014) explored whether altruism can better signal
the genetic quality of the altruist, due to the ``good genes'' that
are perhaps necessary for them to afford the costs of altruistic
behavior (e.g. Miller, 2000) or good phenotypic quality, as the
nature of such behaviors may indicate that the altruist will be a
good partner and parent (e.g., Kokko, 1998; Miller, 2007). This
was achieved by examining how women's preferences for
altruistic men varied across the menstrual cycle, where signals
of good genetic quality are expected to be more desirable dur-
ing the high fertile stage of the cycle, particularly for short-term
(ST) mating (e.g. Gangestad & Haselton, 2015; Gangestad &
Thornhill, 2008; Gildersleeve, Haselton, & Fales, 2014). Both
Farrelly (2011) and Oda et al. (2014) were consistent in finding
that not only were there no effects of menstrual cycle stage on
women's preferences for altruistic traits in men but also that
there were increased preferences for men in long-term (LT)

relationships who displayed in altruism in different contexts
(Farrelly, 2011) and toward different recipients (Oda, Okuda,
Takeda, & Hiraishi, 2014). Therefore, both studies conclude
that altruism functions in mate choice as a signal of phenotypic
qualities, rather than predominantly a signal of genetic quality.
Further support for this is the consistent finding in research
of altruism being more desirable in LT partners (Barclay, 2010;
Farrelly, 2013; Moore et al., 2013) as well as altruists being
more likely to enter LT relationships (Stavrova & Ehlebracht,
2015) and assortative mating for altruistic characteristics
among married couples in Senegal (Tognetti et al., 2012).
However, caution needs to be exercised when examining
whether a specific trait is a signal of either genetic or pheno-
typic qualities based on relationship length alone. This is
because this may not be a clear indication of what is being
signaled, as not all preferences in either ST or LT partners are
for traits that signal genetic or phenotypic quality, respectively
(Buss & Shackelford, 2008). Similarly, any variation for a
complex psychological trait such as altruism will be the prod-
uct of both genetic and phenotypic/environmental causes.
Overall, though, such findings highlight at least in what context
women find altruistic men more desirable (which is LT rela-
tionships) and as a result contributes to our understanding of
altruism's role in human mate choice.
This role can be further understood by examining what hap-
pens to the desirability of men when signals of altruistic beha-
vior vary concurrently with other desired traits in mate choice.
Knowledge of this would help us to further understand the
trade-offs and signals associated with sexually selected altru-
ism. This study aimed to answer this, by building on the above
findings with an examination of how women's preferences for
altruistic men in both ST and LT relationships were affected by
the latter's physical attractiveness. There exists a great deal of
evidence that physical attractiveness can act as a reliable signal
of genetic quality (e.g., Rhodes, 2006) and also that women
have greater preferences for physically attractive men in ST
relationships (Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetchenhauer, & Kenrick,
2002; Li & Kenrick, 2006; Regan, 1998), particularly at the
high fertile stage of the menstrual cycle (Gangestad, Garver-
Apgar, Simpson, & Cousins, 2007; Gangestad, Thornhill, &
Garver-Apgar, 2010). Therefore, the current study will further
our understanding of how physical attractiveness interacts in
women's mate preferences with altruism, which recent evi-
dence (Farrelly, 2011; Oda et al., 2014) suggests is a signal
of good partner/parenting qualities. As such, it will follow from
previous research, which has shown that in forced choice sce-
narios females prefer mates who display ``warmth/trustworthi-
ness'' (which will have parallels to altruistic behavior) than
those who are physically attractive, particularly for longer,
committed relationships (Fletcher, Tither, O'Loughlin, Friesen,
& Overall, 2004).
Overall, the current study examined how the physical attrac-
tiveness and the level of altruism of men affected their desir-
ability to women for both ST and LT relationships. It also
builds on the previous research of Barclay (2010) and Farrelly
(2011) by using short individual profiles presented to
participants and asking them to rate the desirability of each but
with the addition of photographs of these individuals portray-
ing them as either high or low in attractiveness. Based on these
previous findings and theory outlined earlier, it was predicted
that altruists will be rated more desirable than nonaltruists
(Hypothesis 1) and that this preference will be greater for LT
than ST relationships (Hypothesis 2). Furthermore, as the intro-
duction of physical attractiveness as an additional variable in
this study was novel, there is the exploratory hypothesis that
this may further affect the findings relating to these first two
hypotheses. Finally, based on the previous findings of Fletcher,
Tither, O'Loughlin, Friesen, and Overall (2004), it was pre-
dicted that women will show preferences for altruism over
physical attractiveness (Hypothesis 3) and that this preference
will be greater for LT relationships (Hypothesis 4).
Material and Method
Participants
A total of 202 heterosexual women (age M ¼ 21.93, SD ¼ 6.2)
took part in the experiment. Participants completed the study
online using www.surveymonkey.com and were recruited via
opportunistic sampling or received course credit for complet-
ing the study. This research was approved by the university
ethics committee.
Materials
A series of male facial 2-D photographs were sourced from two
different databases, pics.stir.ac.uk and the Radboud Faces
Database (Langner et al., 2010), and were then independently
assessed by three judges (the three authors) who selected the 12
highest and 12 lowest physically attractive men to be included
in the study. Further validation of these selections were from
the overall attractiveness ratings in the main study, whereby the
high attractive men were rated overall as more attractive than
the low attractive men, F(1, 201) ¼ 416.6, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .68.
Pairs of photographs were presented alongside rubrics of
particular scenarios, with the person in each photo given a
neutral label (e.g., ``Person A''). These scenarios described
conditions where individuals could behave altruistically and
are based on similar scenarios used elsewhere (Farthing,
2005; Phillips et al., 2008). Following this, the rubric described
how the two men behaved in response to this scenario, which
was either high in altruism or low in altruism. Apart from these,
participants also viewed pairs of photographs alongside neutral
scenarios, with both individuals described as behaving neither
altruistically nor nonaltruistically (e.g. ``Person O and Person P
both go out clothes shopping, Person O decides to buy a green
jumper and Person P buys a pair of jeans''). Examples of the
different scenarios are provided in Table 1.
Directly underneath this were two questions that related to
each of the individuals. These asked how attractive the person
was for two types of relationship, LT or ST. Definitions of
these two relationship types (ST: a person with whom you
2 Evolutionary Psychology
would desire a brief affair or a one night stand. LT: a person
with whom you desire a committed LT romantic relationship)
were provided based on previous research (Farrelly, 2011).
Both questions required a response on a 5-point Likert-type
scale from very unattractive to very attractive. All research
materials relevant to this article can be accessed by contacting
the corresponding author.
Procedure
Participants first read an information sheet that described the
study as investigating female perceptions of attractiveness in
different scenarios and then provide informed consent. After
giving details of their age, participants were told that they
would be required to rate how attractive they found a number
of different individuals for both ST and LT relationship and
were provided with the descriptions of both relationship
types. Participants then went on to view the different men
with the accompanying scenarios and behaviors as outlined
earlier.
In total, there were 12 scenarios that participants viewed, 8
of which were altruism conditions and 4 of which were neutral.
The order in which participants saw these was randomly deter-
mined, and there were two orders that participants were ran-
domly allocated to at the start of the study. As mentioned
earlier, each scenario was presented with photographs of two
individuals with details of their behavior in relation to the
scenario. In each scenario, participants saw a high attractive
and a low attractive individual paired together. Across these
eight pairings in the ``altruism'' conditions, high attractive indi-
viduals were presented 4 times as being low in altruism and
also 4 times as being high in altruism (the same was also true
for the low attractive individuals).
After viewing all 12 scenarios and completing the attrac-
tiveness ratings for each individual, participants were fully
debriefed as to the true aims of the study and thanked for their
participation.
Results
To test the hypotheses presented in the introduction, a repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, with
attractiveness of target individual (high vs. low), level of altru-
ism (high vs. low), and relationship length (ST vs. LT) as
within-subjects variables. Subsequently are presented the main
results and interactions that are relevant to the hypotheses,
including, where necessary, pairwise comparisons (paired
t-tests).
Hypothesis 1: Altruistic men will be more desirable than
nonaltruistic men.
Individuals who displayed high levels of altruism were rated
significantly more desirable overall than those displaying low
levels of altruism, F(1, 201) ¼ 443.05, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .69, see
Figure 1.
In terms of whether there was a further influence of the
physical attractiveness on the desirability of altruism, a signif-
icant interaction was found between target attractiveness and
level of altruism, F(1, 201) ¼ 178.28, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .47, see
Figure 1. To further understand the nature of this interaction,
the proportional change in the desirability ratings from low
attractive to high attractive men was calculated for both low
and high altruism levels. A paired t-test then revealed that
the proportional increase in ratings from low to high attrac-
tive men was greater when they also displayed high altruism
than when they also displayed low altruism, t(201) ¼ 8.05,
p < .001, r < .27.

Hypothesis 2: Altruistic men will be more desirable for LT
than ST relationships.
There was a significant interaction between level of altruism
and relationship length, F(1, 201) ¼ 167.29, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .45,
see Figure 1. Further, pairwise comparisons revealed that high
altruists were rated more desirable as LT than ST partners,
t(201) ¼ 5.8, p < .001, r ¼ .21, whereas low altruists
were actually rated more attractive as ST than LT partners,
t(201) ¼ 12.9, p < .001, r ¼ .42.
In terms of whether there was a further influence of the
physical attractiveness on the desirability of altruism in LT
partners, a significant three-way interaction between attractive-
ness of target, level of altruism, and relationship length was
found, F(1, 201) ¼ 7.27, p ¼ .008, Z2 ¼ .04, see Figure 1. To
better understand this interaction, proportional changes in rat-
ings from ST to LT relationships were calculated and used as
the dependent variable in a repeated measures ANOVA with
attractiveness of target (high vs. low) and level of altruism
(high vs. low) as within-subjects measures. This revealed a
significant interaction, F(1, 201) ¼ 5.32, p ¼ .022, Z2 ¼ .03,
and subsequent pairwise comparisons revealed that the propor-
tional change from ST to LT was significantly greater for low
attractive men than high attractive men only when they dis-
played high altruism, t(201) ¼ 2.3, p ¼ .022, r ¼ .09, whereas
there was no such significant difference when they displayed
low altruism, t(201) ¼ À.69, p ¼ .49, r ¼ .05, see Figure 2. In
other words, men low in physical attractiveness were preferred
significantly more as LT partners by women only when they
were also altruistic.
Hypothesis 3: Women will show a preference for altruistic
men over physically attractive men.
To test this hypothesis, women's ratings of the desirability
of men who displayed only high levels of either physical
attractiveness or altruism were compared. As a result, it was
found that the desirability of low attractive men who displayed
high altruism was higher than that of high attractive men who
displayed low altruism, t(201) ¼ 6.37, p < .001, r ¼ .22, see
Figure 3.
Hypothesis 4: Women will show a greater preference for
altruistic men over physically attractive men for LT than ST
relationships.
To test this hypothesis, a similar analysis to that of Hypoth-
esis 3 was conducted with relationship length (ST vs. LT)
included as a further within-subjects measure alongside trait
displayed (high altruism vs. high attractiveness) in a repeated
measures ANOVA. This revealed a significant interaction, F(1,
201) ¼ 135.34, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .4, see Figure 3. Subsequent
pairwise comparisons revealed that women's ratings for men
displaying altruism but not attractiveness were significantly
higher than for men displaying attractiveness but not altruism
only for LT relationships, t(201) ¼ 10.69, p < .001, r ¼ .36, and
not for ST relationships, t(201) ¼ 1.55, p ¼ .12, r ¼ .11.
Discussion
As predicted, women found men who behaved altruistically
more desirable than those who did not. This therefore supports
Hypothesis 1 and adds to the body of empirical evidence that
shows altruism has an important role in human mate choice.
Furthermore, women found altruistic men more desirable for
LT relationships, which supports Hypothesis 2 and is in line
with previous findings (e.g., Barclay, 2010; Farrelly, 2011,
2013; Oda et al., 2014). As an interestingly aside to this anal-
ysis, it was also found that nonaltruistic men were more desir-
able for ST relationships, which suggests that rather than
altruism not being important in ST relationships (as previous

term to long-term (+standard error [SE]) of men by level of attrac-
tiveness and level of altruism. Figure 3. Graph of desirability ratings (+standard error [SE]) of men

relationship lengths.

research suggests), in the present study, it is actually undesir-
able. This is a surprising finding, as little is known or
researched about what being un-altruistic means in terms of
mate choice, and is worthy of further investigation. As such,
it may be related to female mate choice for other, less socially
desirable traits that may have a role in male ST mating strate-
gies such as the Dark Triad (e.g., Jonason, Li, Webster, &
Schmitt, 2009).
The preference for altruistic men was also further influenced
by their physical attractiveness, such that the increase in desir-
ability of men as attractiveness increased was significantly
greater when they were also altruistic. This suggests that altru-
ism can have an additive effect to other mate choice qualities
(in this case, physical attractiveness), such that possessing both
qualities has a greater effect on a man's desirability than just a
combination of their individual desirability. Also, the higher
preference for LT over ST relationships with men low in attrac-
tiveness when they were altruistic suggests that being altruistic
may act as a reliable mating strategy for acquiring LT partners
for such men. Further investigation, such as examining how
men of different attractiveness levels use altruistic acts as LT
courtship displays, would explore this possibility in more
depth.
Furthermore, the finding that high altruistic/low attractive
men were rated more desirable than low altruistic/high attrac-
tive men offers support for Hypothesis 3, and further analysis
that revealed that this was only significant for LT relationships
offers support for Hypothesis 4. This suggests that if a man
possesses only one of these traits, it is altruism that is more
valuable, particularly for LT relationships. This, together with
the above findings, provides further evidence of the importance
of altruism in women's mate choice preferences, even when it
is presented with other notable mate choice traits (such as
physical attractiveness). Furthermore, by showing that this
effect is even greater for LT relationships, more evidence is
provided for altruism being a highly important characteristic
trait women look for in LT partners.
To properly interpret these findings, it is also important to
consider some limitations in the methods used. Firstly, both
men in some scenarios (i.e., the one who behaved altruistically
and the one that did not) were presented together, such as in the
first example in Table 1 (rescuing a child from a river). As a
result, this may mean that the nonaltruist in these scenarios may
signal other traits as well such as lack of awareness (empathy)
or apathy. Although such traits will most likely relate to or be
part of a low altruistic nature in such individuals, future
research could examine profiles presented alone to avoid any
possible confounding effect of comparing the altruism levels of
two men simultaneously. Another consideration is that by using
a range of different scenarios in this study, possible character-
istics may have been signaled other than just altruism. For
example, the moral consequences of behaving altruistically in
some scenarios were higher than others, for example, compar-
ing attempting to save a child from drowning with buying food
for a homeless person. Another example is that altruistic beha-
vior in these two scenarios will also vary in the degree to which
physical strength/prowess is also signaled, which will be higher
when jumping into a river to save a child than when buying a
sandwich. Overall, though, all scenarios used in this study can
be considered to act as reliable signals of altruism, even if
individual scenarios may be able to signal other traits as well.
This therefore makes the findings in this study from women's
ratings of altruistic behavior across all scenarios still valid.
Future research however may wish to explore the different
types of altruism signaled in these individual scenarios sepa-
rately in more detail, such as heroism (Farthing, 2005, 2007;
Kelly & Dunbar, 2001) or charitable giving (e.g., Barclay,
2010; Iredale et al., 2008). Such research would need to control
for the extraneous variables that may also be signaled (e.g.,
physical strength across different heroic scenarios) to ensure
that only the value of that type of altruism in mate choice is
reliably being examined.
It will be important for additional research to build on these
findings in certain directions to further aid our understanding.
Firstly, an examination of menstrual cycle effects may shed
some light on the results obtained here. In particular, how they
may affect the potential weightings of altruism and physical
attractiveness in women's ratings of men's desirability across
the cycle. Also, future research needs to examine the effects
found here in men's ratings of the desirability of altruistic
women as well. This is because there is a lack of such research
in this area, as most studies have concentrated on only women's
ratings. However, when both sexes are investigated, it has led
to similar findings (e.g., Farrelly, 2013; Farrelly et al., 2007;
Moore et al., 2013; Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2015), suggesting
that altruism has been shaped by mutual mate choice in humans
(Miller, 2000). It is therefore important to see whether this is
also the case when physical attractiveness is also explored
alongside it. Also of value would be an exploration of the
interaction of the different variables used here in real-world
mate choice settings. Experimentally derived findings on mate
choice decision making such as those outlined here can only
benefit from seeing if the same findings are present when look-
ing at actual relationships and interactions in the real world,
which is a methodology successfully employed elsewhere (e.g.,
Phillips et al., 2008; Stavrova & Ehlebracht, 2015).
To conclude, these findings make a substantial contribution
to our understanding of the role of altruistic behavior in human
mate choice by including the previously unexplored additional
variables of physical attractiveness. Overall, the results provide
further support for the view that altruism acts as an important
trait in mate choice, particularly for LT relationships. This has
important implications for our understanding of how we under-
stand the expression of altruism and other traits holistically by
casting further light on the rich tapestry that is human mating.
This is also evident in the fact that the current study also sug-
gests that nonaltruism may have a role in mate choice, perhaps
aligning the spectrum of behavior explored here with research
on traits such as the Dark Triad. As such, the current study can
aid our understanding of altruism not only in mate choice but
also in different everyday occurrences of this ubiquitous but
enigmatic trait.
