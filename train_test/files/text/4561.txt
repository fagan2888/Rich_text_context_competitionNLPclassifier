Article
The politics of youth culture is a politics of metaphor: it deals in
the currency of signs and is, thus, always ambiguous, because
the subcultural milieu has been constructed underneath the
authorized discourses, in defiance of the multiple disciplines of
the family, the school, and the workplace. Subculture takes
shape in the space between surveillance and the evasion of
surveillance; it translates the fact of being under scrutiny into the
pleasure of being watched. It is a way of "hiding in the light"
(Hebdige, 1988, p. 35).
Hebdige locates subcultures and the subcultural response
somewhere in between affirmation and refusal, commercial-
ization and revolt, and resistance and conformity. Hence,
subcultures are not automatically associated with a "genu-
ine" resistance to societal structures. Instead, they are under-
stood as occupying and representing an ambivalent and
complex position in society.
There are, of course, numerous ways of defining and posi-
tioning subcultures. The concept has often been linked to
notions of spectacular and colorful youth cultures, such as
punk culture, goths, mods, rockers, and skinheads.
Subcultures also have a long history of being described and
defined in terms of "deviance"--something alien/outlandish
(Burke & Sunley, 1998; Gelder, 2007; Nayak & Kehily,
2013). Of course, there is always a certain degree of disparity
between specific subcultures and society at large. But this
does not mean that the distinction between cultural elements
that are perceived as mainstream or common, on one hand,
and elements/symbols/signs that are perceived as subcul-
tural, on the other, is eternal. Rather, subcultures and com-
mon culture change over time, and subcultures tend to
become incorporated into what is referred to as main-
stream--or common--culture. For example, during the
1960s, the two discourses youth as problem and youth as fun
merged into youth as image (Hebdige, 1988). The politics of
youth is thus played out as a spectacle, and as consumption
and lifestyles. Subcultures and youth cultures are, in other
words, constantly being drawn into a circulation of different
signs, images, and signified bodies.
Subcultures are both objects of governmentality and sites
for pleasure, desire, and attention. The contradictory image
of subcultures, captured very well by the description of them
as "hiding in the light" in the quotation above, raises some

From Subcultures to Common Culture:
Bodybuilders, Skinheads, and the
Normalization of the Marginal
Thomas Johansson1, Jesper Andreasson2,
and Christer Mattsson1
Abstract
Using bodybuilders and skinheads/neo-Nazis as two rather diverse examples of subcultures, the present study theoretically
explores our understanding of subculture and common culture. The study aims to explore how the concept of subculture
can be used analytically in relation to processes of normalization and marginalization. The focus is on the historical, symbolic,
and biographical relation between the subculture, the subcultural response, and sociopolitical transformations in society and
culture. We are interested in understanding the processes through which, for example, bodybuilding has moved back and
forth, over time, between a subcultural position and a more common fitness culture. In parallel to this, we are also interested
in how subcultures centered on skinheads, neo-Nazis, and right-wing extremists influence and are connected to more general
political transformations and opinions in contemporary society, blurring the distinction between subculture and common
culture. The results indicate a complex relation between subcultures and the mainstreaming of certain values, opinions, and
practices.

questions as to their status, especially concerning the relation
between specific subcultures and society in general. The
term mainstream has often been used to capture youth in
general, but there are of course reasons to be skeptical of this
way of framing and generalizing about youth. Subcultures
are not homogeneous and coherent, nor are youth in general.
This does not mean, however, that they are fluid, liquid, and
ephemeral. Rather, what is commonly referred to as main-
stream or common culture is complex and constantly in
transformation, at the same time as it is also possible--para-
doxically enough--to understand mainstream culture in
terms of hegemonic cultural formations.
In the present article, we will explore and elaborate on the
concept of subculture. We will use two rather different exam-
ples of subcultures, namely, bodybuilding and skinheads/
neo-Nazis. We will depart from these two examples, which
will be presented as cases or examples of subcultures, to
present a theoretical exploration of our understanding of the
concept of subculture and common culture as well as the pro-
cesses of marginalization and normalization. The main aim
of the article is thus not to add new knowledge or research on
these subcultures per se; nor is the article to be understood as
a comparison of these two cultures, aimed at shedding light
on their differences and similarities. Instead, we aim to
explore the possibility of using the concept of subculture in
relation to the idea of a normalization of certain subcultural
values, ideals and opinions. In the section on methodology,
we will further explain the rational for choosing these two
subcultures, and not others.
Our focus is on the historical, symbolic, and biographical
relation between the subculture and the subcultural response,
on one hand, and sociopolitical transformations in society
and culture, on the other. More precisely, we are interested in
understanding how, for example, bodybuilding has moved
back and forth, over time, between a subcultural position and
a more common fitness culture. We will here focus on the
more competitive and extreme aspects of this lifestyle-form-
ing subcultural practice, and on how individuals through
measures such as muscle building, intentional dehydration,
and elimination of body fat prepare their bodies to be evalu-
ated by a panel of judges in bodybuilding competitions. As a
parallel to this, we are also interested in how subcultures cen-
tered on skinheads, neo-Nazis, and right-wing extremists
influence and are connected to more general political trans-
formations and opinions in society. Although the focus of the
present article is mainly theoretical, our ambition is also to
contribute to methodological innovations in empirical analy-
ses of contemporary and influential subcultures. We will
focus on and explore the following areas in particular:
Research Question 1: How can we theoretically
approach the historical development and transformation
of subcultures?
Research Question 2: What values, ideals, and opinions
are produced within subcultures, and how are they
understood in relation to common culture and sociopoliti-
cal structures?
Research Question 3: Using two examples of subcul-
tures, in what ways can we theoretically understand the
dynamic relation between subcultural content and identi-
ties, and how these also influence and partly contribute to
forming more general cultural and social structures?
While the first two research questions will mainly be
addressed in the "Exploring Two Subcultures" section, where
we present our two examples of subcultures, the third ques-
tion will be explored in the "Conclusion and Discussion"
section. In the following section, we will initially explain the
conceptual framework of the article by focusing on the con-
cept of subculture. Thereafter, we will present some method-
ological considerations.
Conceptual Framework--
Mainstreaming Subcultures
The concept of subculture has a long history in the social sci-
ences. It has been used to define and describe deviant behav-
ior, but also to talk about youth culture in terms of resistance
to and subversion of norms. According to Blackman (2014),
subcultures are often considered barometers of contempo-
rariness and expressions of underlying structural and cultural
transformations in society. One problem in many previous
studies of subculture has been a tendency to exclusively
focus on homologies, and on the ways in which subcultural
styles come together to form homogeneous totalities (Fornäs,
1995, p. 112). Clearly, such tendencies need to be counter-
acted by attending to the differences, tensions, and contradic-
tions within and between subcultures and groups, which
more recent studies of social relations have shown constitute
an increasingly important element of late-modern lifestyles
(Fornäs, 1995; Martin, 2009). In the present article, we will
not repeat the ongoing discussion on different theoretical
approaches to subcultures presented by different scholars,
but instead look more closely at some of the dividing lines in
discourses on subcultures and subcultural responses (Martin,
2009; Muggleton, 2005; Muggleton & Weinzierl, 2003;
Shildrick & MacDonald, 2006).
First, one central discussion on subcultures focuses on
whether the concept is viewed as transitional, fluid, and
transformative or, alternatively, as a more stable and homo-
geneous phenomenon. Criticism of the theories of subcul-
tures coming from the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary
Cultural Studies (CCCS) targeted the centrality that was
attributed to social class as well as CCCS scholars' attempts
to find homologies within subcultures. The idea that youth
cultures could be read as symbolic attempts to solve the
problems of adult culture, caused by transformations of the
class society in Britain, was challenged. To capture the more
fleeting and mediated youth cultures of the 1990s, concepts
such as neo-tribes, postsubcultures, and lifestyles were
Johansson et al. 3
introduced (Robards & Bennett, 2011; Williams, 2006). This
discussion was, and still is, often strongly related to digital
media and to "do-it-yourself" (DIY) youth movements
(McArthur, 2009). As a reaction to this turn toward postsub-
cultures, attempts have been made to find a balance between
CCCS models of subcultures and postsubcultural theories
(Martin, 2009; Muggleton, 2005; Muggleton & Weinzierl,
2003; Shildrick & MacDonald, 2006). Today we are also
seeing a return to class, and to new attempts to explore the
relations between subcultural style and taste and societal
transformations.
Second, subcultures are frequently seen as either expres-
sions of deviance or as creative symbolic responses and reac-
tions to dominant societal values. In theories of subcultures,
we often find an intrinsic distinction between subcultures
and mainstream culture, or between subcultures and com-
mon culture. Either way, there is a varyingly complex rela-
tion between what is "sub" and what is dominant. According
to Hebdige (1979), subcultures are successively incorporated
into and consumed by mainstream culture. However,
Hodkinson (2002) argued that this way of approaching the
relation between sub and dominance tends to undervalue the
contribution of the subculture. Following Hodkinson (2002),
subcultures are not homogeneous and stable phenomena, but
have a certain infrastructure and content. Subcultures offer a
meaningful identity, fulfillment, cultural and political par-
ticipation, and a transgression of dominant norms. Thus,
there is often a high level of distinctiveness and stability, in
the sense of collective identity, fostered within subcultures
(Wheaton, 2007). Subcultures are frequently spectacular, but
there is also a strong relation to the mundane and to the youth
culture at large (Gelder, 1997/2005; Gelder, 2007). The visi-
bility, clarity, and pleasure expressed in subcultural styles
and communities also serve to attract and recruit young peo-
ple to these kinds of groups. To keep attracting young people
to the subculture, it always tends to keep a certain distance to
mainstream culture, and although it is often incorporated into
the common culture, it also reinvents itself and returns from
the oppressed in various subversive and abject forms.
Finally, subcultural research has often taken for granted
that this is exclusively a youth cultural phenomenon. Yet
today punk culture, for example, cuts cross several genera-
tions. Moreover, many influential subcultures are constituted
on an age hierarchy, where older members serve as founders
and important role models. When we study subcultures, we
are also focusing on the infrastructure of these communities.
To sum up, in line with our research questions, we will
focus on the relation between subcultures and societal and
sociopolitical structures, using two carefully selected subcul-
tures. We will use these subcultures to explore the dynamic
relation between subcultural content and identities and how
the subcultures also influence and partly contribute to form-
ing more general cultural and social structures, as well as the
generational aspects of subcultures. Inspired by earlier dis-
cussions of subcultures, we will feed some of the ideas
emerging from such discussions into our exploration of two
selected subcultures.
Methodology and Research Design
Our investigation of the two cases we chose to deepen and
develop our exploration of subcultures in contemporary
Western societies will be based on interviews and research
on these subcultures and on our readings of secondary litera-
ture. Inspired by Resistance Through Rituals, we will use
ideas from this work to structure our analysis (Hall &
Jefferson, 1976). In their study, Hall and Jefferson distin-
guish between three aspects or analytical levels: structures,
cultures, and biographies. We will modify these aspects and
adjust them to our study. Here, structures will be used to dis-
cuss the formation of the subculture in relation to class, soci-
etal changes, and cultural transformation. We are inspired by
the CCCS approach to subcultures, but also by postsubcul-
tural theories that point out the importance of social media in
the formation of contemporary subcultures. Cultures will be
used to explore the symbolic and corporeal landscape of sub-
cultures. Biographies will help us study how individual tra-
jectories and narratives are intertwined with and connected
to the formation of subcultures. Consequently, using inter-
view excerpts, we will capture how members of subcultures
position and understand their lifestyle choices and cultural
community in relation to the surrounding world.
As stated above, the present article should primarily be
understood as theoretical and explorative in nature, although
it rests in part on comprehensive empirical material gathered
in different research projects on bodybuilding and neo-
Nazism by the authors over a period of several years. Here,
the empirical material is mainly used as an inspiration for our
more extensive and exploratory theoretical work. The ratio-
nale for choosing these two case studies and examples is
partly related to the authors' research interests, and partly to
our collaborative discussions on how to theoretically
approach two--in many ways--totally different subcultures.
Discovering that there actually exist a number of similarities
and homologies regarding how these two subcultures
develop, transform, and change led us on to writing this arti-
cle, as well as the ambition to explore possibilities of devel-
oping subcultural theory in general.
The first subcultural case is the bodybuilding and fitness
culture, and the material used comes from a larger ethno-
graphic study on bodybuilding and gym culture. Thirty-two
competitive bodybuilders participated in the study. The par-
ticipants were mainly Swedish, although bodybuilders from
other countries, such as the United States, also contributed
their stories. This extensive empirical material have previ-
ously been analyzed in several articles and a book
(Andreasson & Johansson, 2014).
The second case study is based on interviews from an
ongoing study on pedagogical strategies used to counteract
Nazism and racism in the classroom, and evaluation
4 SAGE Open
interviews from an intervention program aimed at preventing
recruitment to White power gangs. The sample consists of
five interviews with former Nazi activists (conducted from
October to December 2015 in the pedagogical strategy study)
and another 12 interviews conducted in the intervention pro-
gram (total 17 interviews). This is a part of an ongoing
research project, and no results have been published earlier.
In our presentation, we have no desire to try to separate
the empirical material and secondary literature from the the-
oretical and conceptual frameworks. Rather we are treating
and understanding our empirical material as already satu-
rated in theory.
Using two diverse examples of subcultures, our ambition
is to develop a theoretical and methodological understanding
of and approach to subcultures. Regarding theory, we will
focus on how to approach the concept in terms of (a) subcul-
tures' inner dynamics and structure, (b) dynamic relations
between subcultures and common culture, and (c) genera-
tional dynamics. Regarding methodology, as stated earlier,
we will look more closely at how we can investigate different
subcultures through (a) structures, (b) cultures, and (c) biog-
raphies. Whereas our theoretical investigation will lead us to
the common dynamics and mechanisms in different subcul-
tures, our methodological exploration will open up new ways
of approaching this field of research. Our descriptions of the
two subcultures will by necessity be quite short and sche-
matic, and our aim is not to deliver complete case studies, but
instead to indicate possible ways of writing about and pre-
senting subcultural transformations in contemporary
society.
Exploring Two Subcultures
From Bodybuilding to the Fitness Revolution
The idea of competent and muscular bodies found in contem-
porary fitness culture can be traced back to what used to be
called physical culture in the late 19th century and to the
teachings of the forefathers of bodybuilding (Budd, 1997).
As a cultural phenomenon, however, contemporary body-
building is more connected to what happened in the 1970s, at
Gold's gym, Venice Beach, California (McKenzie, 2013). In
a relatively short period of time, Gold's Gym blossomed and
developed from a small, shabby, subcultural, and marginal
gym into a 400-strong global franchise (Gaines & Butler,
1974; Klein, 1993; Liokaftos, 2012; Luciano, 2001).
The interest in bodybuilding, workout techniques, aero-
bics, and fitness in general exploded starting from the 1970s
and entering into the 1980s. Gradually, the understanding
of this male dominated culture was renegotiated, and
women also became involved. There are, of course, mani-
fold explanations as to why this body-centered culture
transformed. Susan Jeffords situates this transformation in
the historical period of Reagan and Thatcher, war and
nationalist movements.
The Reagan era was an era of bodies. From the anxieties about
Reagan's age and the appearance of cancerous spots on his nose;
to the profitable craze in aerobics and exercise; to the moulding
of a former Mr. Universe into the biggest box-office draw of the
decade; to the conservative agenda to outlaw abortion; to the
identification of "value" through an emphasis on drug use,
sexuality, and child-bearing; to the thematized aggression
against persons with AIDS--these articulations of bodies
constituted the imaginary of the Reagan agenda and the site of
its materialization. (Jeffords, 1994, p. 24)
The development within bodybuilding, from the 1970s
and onward, can be interpreted as a zeitgeist and as an exam-
ple of how a subcultural practice is gradually both globalized
and normalized in the common culture. The development
toward a global culture is accentuated by the mediatization
of society, and the development of a global business enter-
prise. During this period of time (the 1980s and 1990s), both
men and women are involved, and previous connotations to
masculine working-class bodies are gradually replaced by a
more diffuse and broad inclusion of both working- and mid-
dle-class participants. This does not mean, of course, that all
class and gender distinctions have been erased from the
bodybuilding culture, but merely that from being a more
exclusive sport, there has been a movement toward mass par-
ticipation in fitness. Sassatelli (2010) captured this develop-
ment in the following way:
Since the 1970s there has been a marked increase in the number
of exercise premises presenting themselves in a new guise. They
have addressed an increasingly large, mixed public. They have
shifted the notion of the gym from a sub-cultural passion to a
mass leisure activity, intertwined with pop culture. (p. 17)
During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a massive devel-
opment in the gym culture. For example, in 1991, there were
300 fitness gyms in Sweden, and approximately 250,000
individuals exercised in these gyms, whereas at the begin-
ning of 1980s, gyms were few and visited primarily by a
small group of enthusiasts and bodybuilder fans. However,
parallel to this development, the reputation and popularity of
bodybuilding have been negatively affected by the increas-
ing use of performance-/image-enhancing drugs, and the
health problems associated with so-called distorted body
images. As a consequence, bodybuilding has gradually
become disconnected from the more general development
and trend of fitness gyms, and from a conception of the gym
as a place for everyone and a mass leisure activity (Smith
Maguire, 2008). This recent popularization of somewhat
extreme cultural body ideals is an interesting period of time
in which the techniques of building muscles and sculpting a
perfect body were idealized, at the same time as the people
embodying these techniques--bodybuilders--were not
(Pope, Phillips, & Olivardia, 2000). One of our informants
captures this process of marginalization, in which some ide-
als, values, and knowledge on how to train the body are
Johansson et al. 5
recognized and normalized, while other aspects of the cul-
ture are dismissed.
Well I think it's a subculture everywhere now. Who wants to look
like a bodybuilder? I think here in the US, especially in the
organization here, we are moving into bikini and figure
competitions. They are trying to get a little more mainstream, like
men's physique for example. Obviously all these foreign countries
are copying what we are doing here. Especially in European
countries I think that the fit model look is much more desirable.
Look at the numbers of men's physique and bikini competitors;
they far outnumber everyone else, as far as the numbers of people
participating. But I think it's much more tolerance here, aside
from anabolic steroids that they love to arrest people for, no one is
like profiling people because they are big, and say let's arrest him
cause he must be doing something wrong you know. In Sweden,
you know they can arrest you if think you are taking something or
if you look too big. It's really bad. (David Palumbo)
David "Dave" Palumbo is a retired American elite level
bodybuilder, living in New York. He is currently running a
successful company within the bodybuilding domain, selling
supplements, and producing radio and Internet shows cover-
ing relevant news and events from a global bodybuilding
scene. He also coaches professional bodybuilders and figure
and fitness competitors and can thus be said to have high
symbolic capital within the bodybuilding culture. Following
his narrative, it becomes clear how bodybuilding has succes-
sively been detached from a more general fitness trend.
The cultural and gradual separation between bodybuilding
as a subculture and fitness does not mean that these phenom-
ena have become two different activities and lifestyles. These
conceptions of exercise and lifestyles are partly disconnected
from each other and partly becoming increasingly dependent
on each other. This double-edginess can also be exemplified
by one of the most influential persons in bodybuilding cul-
ture, namely, Arnold Schwarzenegger. On one hand, after his
career as a bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger became involved in
mainstream films, the Hollywood industry, and he also
became highly influential in American politics. This was cen-
tral to imbuing excessive muscularity with the hyper-visibil-
ity that presented the bodybuilder as a figure of staggering
power (Locks & Richardson, 2012). On the other hand, at the
peak of his career, Schwarzenegger was the greatest body-
builder competitor ever seen, and as such he was clearly
viewed, to some extent, as freakish by the standards of parts
of the general public. According to Locks and Richardson
(2012), Schwarzenegger's impact on the culture was to intro-
duce a postclassic aesthetic era, in which competitive body-
builders could no longer be compared with Greek art, which
symbolizes proportion, symmetry, and order.
It is ironic that the very person who helped provide bodybuilding
with its greatest publicity since the turn of the last century
should be largely responsible for encouraging the aesthetic that
has severed professional bodybuilding from much of its classical
lineage, thereby promoting a look that would ostracize it again
from the mainstream that it (and Schwarzenegger) had just been
admitted to . . . Many outside professional bodybuilding, who
are not used to seeing such bodies (particularly during periods of
competition), feel that professional bodybuilders take the ideals
of bodily perfection to such an extreme that these very attributes
begin to reverse themselves. The mesomorphic body shape,
which came to be so prized in the visual discourse, has become
a "freakish" image that has shock value. (Locks & Richardson,
2012, pp. 15-16)
Over time, bodybuilding and its status have changed and
transformed. At the beginning of the 20th century and again
in the 1970s, bodybuilding attained high status, and in cer-
tain countries, for example, the United States, it was not at all
a subculture, but rather something of a masculine mass
movement. Today, bodybuilding is often described and stud-
ied as a subculture, associated with extreme bodies and drugs
(Liokaftos, 2012; McGrath & Chananie-Hill, 2009;
Monaghan, 2001).
At the same time, bodybuilders are highly visible in com-
mon culture (Bridges, 2009). A large number of international
magazines are devoted entirely to the art of bodybuilding.
There are many books and manuals on the market that offer
training programs for bodybuilding, and through different
organizations, such as The International Federation of
Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB), bodybuilding has become a
global enterprise and sport that clearly extends beyond the
concept of subculture. Pumping iron at the gym certainly char-
acterizes the lifestyle of the bodybuilder, but may also be part
of the lifestyle of the average person trying to improve his or
her own health. Moreover, elite athletes also commonly use
bodybuilding techniques in their attempts to become better at
their sport and more competitive. Consequently, although con-
temporary representations of bodybuilding bodies are not
unproblematic and the bodybuilder often is viewed as some-
thing of a freak in everyday life situations, the huge muscular
male and female body, the lifestyle this body represents, the
techniques used and developed within bodybuilding, the disci-
pline, the supplementary knowledge, and more are also highly
valued/idealized in contemporary society. This becomes very
clear when we look at the development of fitness culture in
recent decades and the techniques used to strengthen the body
within modern competitive sports. It could be argued that the
freakishness of contemporary bodybuilding might actually be
better characterized as a societal development than a subcul-
tural one. In sum: The fitness revolution--evolving as a mass
enterprise, washing off the stamp of the more grotesque parts
of bodybuilding culture, the drugs, and the extreme cult of the
huge muscular body--has also led in one respect to the devel-
opment of a more uniform and homogeneous global gym and
fitness culture, and in another respect to glocal variations in
the adaptation of this culture. Parallel to this development,
however, bodybuilders today also tend to become even more
extreme, using steroids to boost their bodies, trying to reassert
their positions as subcultural and as something totally different
from the fitness bodies.

From Skins and Neo-Nazi Subcultures to Neo-
Conservatism
In this case study, we will follow a path stretching from the
British skinheads toward neo-Nazi subcultures and the
development of right-wing and neo-conservative political
parties in contemporary Europe.
Skinhead style had its origins in South and East London's
working-class districts in the mid- to late 1960s (Ware &
Back, 2002). Brake (1974) described skins as working-
class adolescents from the poorer parts of society. The skins
perceived hippies as lazy and dirty, and they despised
everything about them (Brake, 1974). Their style was very
spectacular, with Doc Marten boots, cropped and bald hair-
styles, and tight Levi jeans. According to Ware and Back
(2002), skinheadism emerged in 1969, in the backwater of
social movements such as gay rights and feminism. This
style was distinguished by its heterosexual, working-class,
masculine, and aggressive symbolism. Ware and Back
claim that two maxims held this culture together: the recov-
ery of Englishness/Britishness and the striving for White
authenticity. In the early days, skinhead culture was charac-
terized by a strange mixture of open racism and nationalism
and hybridity and openness to a diversity of cultural
influences.
In an early study of 50 skinheads in East London, certain
key values and interests were laid out by the sociologist Mike
Brake (1974):
·
· Toughness and violence: Skinheads seemed obsessed
with violence and a macho culture, worshiping mus-
cles, hardness, and aggressive behavior.
·
· Football: Skinheads were solid supporters of their
national team, and had a passionate attachment to
their local club.
·
· Ethnocentrism: The subculture was heavily inclined
to hold racist attitudes and to despise homosexuals
and others who threatened their sense of Britishness.
However, their racism was initially complex, and sev-
eral skinhead groups had Afro-Caribbean members.
This changed later on, however.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the subcultural ele-
ments of skinhead culture converged and were drawn into
the British Movement and the National Front.
The political affiliations of skins were signified by the color of
the laces worn in their characteristic Doc Marten boots: white
laces indicated support for the National Front, and red laces
attested British Movement affiliation. This was mirrored in the
musical tastes with the emergence of the postpunk Oi! music
scene with bands like Sham 69 and the Cockney Rejects, while
the National Front sponsored White Noise Music Club, set up by
two key young fascist activists, Patrick Harrington and Nick
Griffin, and British Nazi musician Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1979.
(Ware & Back, 2002, p. 101)
During the 1980s and 1990s, racist skinheadism was
exported to several European countries, among them Sweden
and Norway. In this transnational diffusion and transmission
of skinhead culture, two things remained intact: nationalism
and national chauvinism as well as White pride, on one hand,
and a language of racist rhetoric, on the other.
According to Fangen (1998), the right wing of the skin-
head subculture has had clear representatives in Europe and
the United States since the late 1980s. Although there are
strong affiliations and connections between skinhead culture
and Nazism, there are also certain differences. The subculture
harbors aggression toward immigrants and homosexuals sim-
ilar to that of Nazism, but it differs from Nazism in its oppo-
sitional attitude toward authority. Fangen (1998) interviewed
40 persons active in the Norwegian skinhead subculture in the
1990s. She found, among other things, that they idealized
images of past communities and traditions. The skinheads did
not celebrate ambivalence and multitudes of identities, but
instead ethnic heritage and a nostalgic longing for stability
and traditions. The fantasy world of the primarily male skin-
heads is filled with rigid us-them categories, aggressions
toward immigrants, and images of themselves as warriors in a
race war. Similar patterns have also been found in studies of
skinheads in Germany and Finland (Perho, 2000).
In a study on ex-neo-Nazis in Scandinavia, the American
sociologist Michael Kimmel (2007) found both similarities
and differences between Scandinavian and American skin-
heads and neo-Nazis. The Scandinavian adolescents--
mostly young men--committed to skinhead culture during a
period of their life and used it as a rite of passage, whereas
the American skinheads were more committed to racialized
ideologies. According to the Scandinavian Skinheads who
left the subculture, this had been a rite passage for alienated
and insecure adolescent males. Another difference lies in the
active and central role played by women in American groups
on the far right.
According to Watts (2001), skinhead culture in the 2000s
is evolving and developing. Three types of development are
visible: (a) the adaptation of skinhead culture and values to
the local and national political culture, (b) the increased net-
working and internationalization of skinhead and neo-Nazi
subculture, and (c) the commercialization and commodifica-
tion of skinhead culture (Campbell, 2006; Sela-Shayovitz,
2011). To describe the development from subculture to main-
streaming, we will look more closely at the Swedish case.
The White power movement was established in Sweden
during the early 1990s. It was a result of a blending between
the traditional Nazi organizations, the skinhead culture, and
an influence from American White supremacy ideology. The
White power movement became a subculture of its own
thanks to its rituals, use of symbols, production of aesthetics,
and certainly its production of ideology. But it was never a
uniform subculture, as it produced diverse expressions within
its domains and simultaneously struggled to exclude diver-
sity. The skinhead culture is a clear example of this. The
Johansson et al. 7
skinheads were an essential part of the White power culture,
not least as consumers of White power music. In this case,
they were indeed needed to maintain financial sustainability.
They were also appreciated as "bodyguards" during rallies
and other forms of public manifestations. At the same time,
for the more political parts of the White power movement,
they were unpredictable and uncontrollable. Their use of vio-
lence and alcohol often resulted in an undesired bad image
for the movement (Lööw, 2002, 2015). But the aesthetics of
the skinhead culture became crucial in the early 1990s when
the universal formation of the White power movement
recruited its followers in local communities without these
local groups having had any earlier relations with key per-
sons in the movement. Through the aesthetics of the skin-
head culture, newcomers found an easy and clearly
understood way to portray themselves as members of the
White power movement. For some of its members, this has
been described as a passing stage in their later more pro-
found engagement into Nazism (Fangen, 1998). In the study
mentioned earlier, Anders, a former Nazi activist, says the
following:
I first got involved in the movement via "Vikingrock" music. I
approached a guy who I knew also liked this music and he was
a skinhead. So I tried my best to look like him, cut my hair, put
on boots and a "Bomber" jacket without more consideration
than that I wanted to fit in with him and that others should see
me as connected to him and, yes the skinhead culture. It was
only later that this brought me to a broader group of people,
skinheads but also others in the movement where I got my
political awareness and joined a Nazi party. (Anders)
There were several attempts to form a solid base for a
strong attack on the multicultural within this milieu. These
efforts stretched from ideas about armed struggles, even war,
to relatively pragmatic parliamentary attempts. In all cases,
the attempts ultimately aimed at a profound change in the
society, where nationalistic and/or race hierarchies were to
be reestablished. This struggle emerged in a context where
individuals were drifting between informal social formations
and organized activities and parties.
According to the former Nazi activist Anders, he and his
comrades adapted their cultural expressions to how they
interpreted the context:
After my period as a skinhead and when I became more political,
I also adapted my style to the political struggle, both my clothing
and behaviour, at least when we were in public. In this process I
started considering how I should behave to have maximum
output when we were trying to attract newcomers but also
without losing the style that was us. (Anders)
By the end of the 1990s, the skinhead culture rapidly
declined, and at the same time, the split between the race-
ideological part of the movement and the more pragmatic
parliamentary part became definitive. Until the mid-1990s,
the Swedish Democratic Party (SD) frequently used skin-
heads as "bodyguards," but this ceased during the second
half of the 1990s. In the skinhead culture as well as the White
power movement as a whole, it was common to see this
change as a betrayal on the part of the SD. The definitive
break between the pragmatic parliamentary groups and the
White power movement was strongly related to the latter
groups' experiences of their inability to reach out to people
outside the current movement (Lööw, 2015). This break was
completed on an organization level before the turn of the mil-
lennium, but it is clear that, within the White power move-
ment, there is still positive identification with the later
success of the SD. The leading Nazi organization in Sweden,
"The Nordic Resistance Movement," held a poll on their web
page after the parliamentary election of 2014. They asked
readers whether or not the growing support for the SD would
benefit the Swedish people, and of the 1,144 responses, more
than 60% felt it would ("The Question of the Week," 2014).
This, together with similar polls and articles in the White
power media, is only an indication of the still lasting rela-
tions or identifications between the former comrades from
the late 1980s or early 1990s.
To understand the current political structure of the SD, it
is crucial to look beyond the development of organizations
and ideologies within the contemporary history of the
extreme right. The SD has emerged from a subcultural con-
text that depends on the White power movement, where they
share the experience of a continuous struggle between defin-
ing a position and achieving social and political recognition.
Today SD has become normalized and gradually a part of the
democratic system, whereas some of their earlier affiliates--
as for example, The Nordic Resistance Movement--have
become radicalized and gradually more militant and extreme.
Conclusion and Discussion
The mass media present deviants as oddities that are seen as
disrupting the orderly universe. Their contra-cultural values and
behaviour are described using lurid details, thus reassuring the
reader that normality exists--that ordinary, decent, everyday
values are intact. It was in this way that the racism found
throughout English society was perceived and reported as the
idiosyncratic behaviour of a small group of violent teenagers,
attributing racist and anti-homosexual beliefs. The appertaining of
racism and homosexuality to a small group missed the fact that
these attitudes were widely spread throughout all classes of
political climate. At the same time, it indicated to skinheads in the
provinces that, in order to be a righteous skinhead, you had to
attack Pakistanis, homosexuals and hippies. (Brake, 1974, p. 194)
In his classic study on skinheads, Mike Brake strongly
emphasized the bridges and connections between subcultural
processes, expressions, values, and styles and the similar
sentiments and values existing in society at large. In the pres-
ent article, we have discussed the concept of subculture, on
one hand, and applied and elaborated on this discussion in
8 SAGE Open
relation to two carefully selected examples of subcultures, on
the other. Ours is primarily an explorative study, aimed at
extending and developing ideas on how subcultures and sub-
cultural processes connect and support more general societal
and cultural transformations. In addition, we also want to
point out possible ways of methodologically exploring sub-
cultural phenomena.
Regarding theory, our ambition has been to reconnect to
the CCCS and the concept of subcultures. However, we also
wish to use insights and theoretical developments from post-
subcultural theories. Instead of looking at subcultures as
fluid and as in constant transition, we focus on the relation
between subcultural styles and values and societal and cul-
tural transformations. Looking at the two present case stud-
ies, it is obvious that there are bridges and connections
between the values and opinions cultivated within the sub-
cultural framework and more general sociocultural and polit-
ical developments in society.
Exploring the relation between subcultures and the main-
streaming of certain values, opinions, and practices, we can
see how subcultural values and sentiments tend to turn into
more accepted and normalized ways of relating to the body,
health, and politics. Deviance is turned into "normality," and
although some parts and contents of subcultures are toned
down, core points and values are extracted and generalized.
Bodybuilding has transformed into fitness, but the core val-
ues of hard bodies, muscle training, health, and asceticism
are highly present in the fitness culture, as well as in more
common and dominant sociocultural patterns in, for exam-
ple, Sweden and the United States. What is interesting here is
the process through which common culture is gradually wid-
ened and, in some sense, incorporates particular lifestyle
attributes and values.
However, the process of normalization does not mean that
the complete subcultural content is incorporated and swal-
lowed up. Rather there is some discrimination regarding what
kind of subcultural content can leak out of the subcultural
milieu and be absorbed. Body techniques, discipline, and
knowledge about how to transform the body are being incor-
porated into fitness culture, and consequently being trans-
formed, marketed, and commercialized. At the same time,
certain bodies are framed as too extreme, connected to
unhealthy lifestyles, to drugs, and to narcissism, thus being
marginalized from the more public domains of fitness culture.
In a similar vein, the core values and sentiments of skinhead
and right-wing subcultures--xenophobia and nationalism--
are currently becoming part of the political culture in many
European countries. At the same time, xenophobia and
nationalism are often framed in terms of racism and, thereby,
excluded from the public culture.
When addressing questions regarding subcultures, we often
immediately think about young people and youth culture. If we
study contemporary subcultures, it becomes apparent that there
are strong intergenerational connections and roots in previous
subcultural formations. Many leading profiles are middle-aged
or older. To study subcultures, we need to contextualize and
investigate both the complex and contradictory structure and
content of these "cultures," as well as the hierarchical relations
involved in organizing subcultures.
Regarding methodology, we can also draw some conclu-
sions from the present exploratory study. First, subcultures
should be positioned in relation to certain societal transfor-
mations. Subcultural expressions and styles become signifi-
cant and worth studying when they are situated in particular
historical periods of time and in relation to societal changes
affecting the balance between what is subcultural and what is
"common." Reading the cultural level in relation to these
fundamental societal changes also leads us to interesting
analyses of how the more ephemeral aspects of subcul-
tures--such as styles, clothes, values, and artifacts--can be
understood as parts of more general transformations in soci-
ety. Listening to voices, narratives, and expressions of desire
at the biographical level also directs us to microtransforma-
tions of the subjective content in subcultures and in society.
Although our ambition has not been to compare the two
subcultures, or to include them in a more elaborated analysis
of contemporary society, in the next step, there is, of course,
a possibility to start mapping out a more general understand-
ing on how different contemporary subcultures connect both
to each other and to more general transformations in society.
Subcultures speak to us, signal changes, and disturb our
understanding of what is "normal" versus "deviant" in trou-
bling ways. Using subcultures as seismographs, we can gain
new insights into the interplay between the subversive and
the "normal," and also sharpen our theoretical tools and pos-
sibilities of studying social and cultural change.
