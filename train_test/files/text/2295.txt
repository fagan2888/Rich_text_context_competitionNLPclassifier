Very little is known about the potential relationship between welfare state regimes
and oral health. This study assessed the oral health of adults in a range of Euro-
pean countries clustered by welfare regimes according to Ferrera's typology and the
complementary Eastern type. We analysed data from Eurobarometer wave 72.3, a
cross-sectional survey of 31 European countries carried out in 2009. We evaluated
three self-reported oral health outcomes: edentulousness, no functional dentition
(<20 natural teeth), and oral impacts on daily living. Age-standardized prevalence
rates were estimated for each country and for each welfare state regime. The Scan-
dinavian regime showed lower prevalence rates for all outcomes. For edentulousness
and no functional dentition, there were higher prevalence rates in the Eastern
regime but no significant differences between Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, and South-
ern regimes. The Southern regime presented a higher prevalence of oral impacts on
daily living. Results by country indicated that Sweden had the lowest prevalences
for edentulousness and no functional dentition, and Denmark had the lowest preva-
lence for oral impacts. The results suggest that Scandinavian welfare states, with
more redistributive and universal welfare policies, had better population oral health.
Future research should provide further insights about the potential mechanisms
through which welfare-state regimes would influence oral health.

Political factors have been increasingly recognized as
crucial social determinants of health (1­7). Macro-level
social policies influence socio-economic inequality,
social and cultural capital, and features of the health-
care system. They, in turn, have significant effects on
psychosocial, material, and behavioural factors related
to general and oral health (3, 8­13). In broad terms,
welfare state institutions and policies affect the distribu-
tion of resources that are important to health, such as
housing, education, nutrition, and child and health care
(14). There is a growing body of research on the associ-
ation between population health and welfare states (2,
7, 12, 15­17). Studies have consistently shown better
performance for health indicators (e.g. infant mortality
rates) in Scandinavian (social democratic) welfare states,
which have more generous and universal welfare provi-
sions, compared with other welfare regimes (2, 5, 6).
To analyse some of these issues, the welfare regimes
framework has been instrumental as a theoretical per-
spective. BAMBRA et al. (18) indicated that welfare state
refers to `a particular form of state or specific type of
society' and usually alludes to the role played by the
state in social services and benefits, such as education,
health, housing, poverty relief, and unemployment,
among others. Although the emphasis is placed on the
state, other definitions also mention the market and the
family. Welfare state is therefore defined as the combi-
nation of market, state, and family in providing goods
and services within a country (19). According to
ESPING-ANDERSEN (20), countries can be clustered in
welfare state regimes based on three principles: decom-
modification (the extent to which individuals and fami-
lies can maintain a socially acceptable livelihood
regardless of their market performance), social stratifi-
cation (state commitment to maintain or break down
social stratification) and the private­public mix (institu-
tional arrangements for assigning welfare functions to
the state, the market, and the family) (13, 20­25).
Diverse typologies of welfare state regimes have been
proposed according to the type and content of welfare
policies (26). The typology most widely used was pro-
posed by ESPING-ANDERSEN (20, 26­28) and defines
three types of welfare states: liberal (most welfare
goods and services are provided by the market), conser-
vative (a key role is played by the family, and certain
earnings-related welfare benefits are provided by the
state), and social-democratic (universal and comprehen-
sive benefits are provided by the state and there is a
high level of decommodification). However, some
shortcomings of this typology, such as the range of
countries and regimes included, and the methodology
used (29), have led to the development of alternative

typologies. Among these, Ferrera'S classification (30) is
recognized as one of the most accurate as it considers
not only the quantity of welfare provided but how wel-
fare benefits are delivered (31­33). Ferrera identifies
four types of welfare states: Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon,
Bismarckian, and Southern (30, 32). While the first
three types resemble the Esping-Andersen social-demo-
cratic, liberal, and conservative groups, respectively, the
additional Southern type clusters countries with frag-
mented welfare benefits. These are: generosity in certain
provisions, but weak in others; a marked public­private
mix in benefits and services; and some corruption in
the selective distribution of cash subsidies (30, 33).
More recently, the complementary Eastern European
welfare state type has been considered, in the social
policy literature, to account for specific features of
countries that have experienced dramatic changes from
a communist welfare state to systems characterized by
marketization and decentralization (21). As a result,
public health researchers have increasingly used five
regime types within Europe: Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon,
Bismarckian, Southern, and Eastern (28, 32, 34, 35).
As stated earlier, populations living in social demo-
cratic welfare states that have more generous and uni-
versal welfare provisions have better health (2, 5, 6).
However, only one relevant cross-national comparative
study has considered how oral health varies by welfare
regime. SANDERS et al. (36) assessed the relationship
between welfare states and income inequalities in oral
health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) using the Kor-
pi and Palme welfare typology that is based on the gen-
erosity and coverage of two social programmes:
pensions, and sickness cash benefits. The study com-
pared four countries (Finland, the UK, Germany, and
Australia) and showed significantly lower income
inequalities in OHRQoL in Germany, where the two
social programmes have universal coverage and earn-
ings-related benefits, and larger inequalities in Austra-
lia, where benefits are means-tested and the coverage is
limited to the low-income part of the population.
To our knowledge, no study has looked at the rela-
tionship between welfare regimes and oral health,
rather than oral health inequalities; none has used Fer-
rera's typology to analyse oral health in European
countries; and none has included more than one coun-
try per welfare state regime. The objective of this study
was therefore to assess adults' oral health in a wide
range of European countries clustered by welfare state
regime, according to Ferrera's typology and the com-
plementary Eastern type.
Material and methods
Data source and study sample
We used data from the Eurobarometer 72.3, a cross-sectional
survey conducted in 2009 by TNS Opinion & Social at the
request of the European Commission. The survey used a mul-
tistage, random sampling design to provide representative
samples of the adult population in 31 European countries
(the 27 Member States of the European Union, three candi-
date countries ­ Croatia, Turkey, and the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia ­ and the Turkish Cypriot Commu-
nity). In each country, all administrative regional units were
considered, and sampling points were selected with probabil-
ity proportional to population size and density. From the
sampling points, households were randomly selected, and in
each household, one respondent was randomly selected. Data
were obtained through face-to-face interviews based on a
questionnaire proposed by the European Global Oral Health
Indicators Development project.
The survey included separate samples for Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, as well as for East and West Ger-
many. We combined the first two as the United Kingdom
and the last two as Germany. The total sample of 30,292
individuals,  15 yr of age, was used for analyses by
country. As the focus was on welfare state regimes, 21
countries classified either in Ferrera's typology or in the
Eastern welfare state type were included in the analyses.
The total sample for these 21 countries consisted of 21,731
people, with sample sizes in individual countries ranging
from 500 to 1,550.
Oral health outcomes
We considered two self-reported oral health measures: (i)
the number of natural teeth, and (ii) the frequency of
impacts of oral conditions on daily life. The number of
natural teeth was reported through a five-item scale: all;
 20, but not all; 10­19; 1­9; and no natural teeth. Two
binary variables were created: one for not having a
functional dentition (fewer than 20 natural teeth) (37), and
another for edentulousness (no natural teeth). Only
participants  45 yr of age were included in the analysis
for no functional dentition and edentulousness. In addi-
tion, only dentate persons were considered for no func-
tional dentition.
The impacts of oral conditions on quality of life referred
to the frequency of the following seven items during the
last 12 months: difficulties eating food, difficulties in chew-
ing/biting foods, experiencing pain, feeling tense, feeling
embarrassed, avoiding conversation, and reducing partici-
pation in social activities. Frequency was measured on an
ordinal scale: often, from time to time, rarely, or never.
We combined the first two (from time to time and often)
and the last two (rarely and never) categories to create a
dichotomous indicator for the prevalence of any impact.
Welfare state regimes
Countries were clustered according to Ferrera's welfare
regime typology (Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian,
and Southern) and the additional Eastern regime. This
resulted in five welfare state regimes: Scandinavian (Sweden,
Finland, and Denmark), Anglo-Saxon (the UK and Ire-
land), Bismarckian (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,
Luxemburg, and the Netherlands), Southern (Greece, Italy,
Portugal, and Spain), and Eastern (Czech Republic, Esto-
nia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia).
Analysis
We estimated the prevalence rates of oral-health outcomes
for each country and welfare state type. The prevalence
rates were age-standardized by the direct method, using
the whole sample for the 31 countries as a standard popu-
lation. A poststratification sample weighting (that accounts
170 Guarnizo-Herre~
no et al.
for nonresponse) and a population-size weighting were used
in the analyses to obtain population-based estimates.
Results
Table 1 presents the age-standardized prevalence rates
of oral-health outcomes in the different countries. Swe-
den had the lowest prevalences for no functional denti-
tion (14.4%) and edentulousness (2.94%), and
Denmark had the lowest prevalence of oral impacts on
daily life (13.8%). On the other hand, Poland had the
highest prevalence of edentulousness (26.7%) and Hun-
gary had the highest prevalence for no functional denti-
tion (72.7%). Of the three oral-health outcomes
considered, a larger variation in edentulousness existed
between countries. There were also variations within
groupings of welfare regimes. For example, within the
Scandinavian welfare regime, the age-standardized
prevalence of edentulousness ranged from 2.94% in
Sweden to 12% in Finland, and, in the Eastern regime,
from 13.7% in Estonia to 26.7% in Poland.
Figure 1 shows the prevalence rates of each oral
health outcome by welfare state regime. For the two clin-
ical outcomes (edentulousness and no functional denti-
tion), the Scandinavian regime had a significantly lower
prevalence and the Eastern regime had a significantly
higher prevalence, when compared with the other welfare
regimes. The prevalences of edentulousness and no func-
tional dentition in the other three welfare regimes lay
between those of the Scandinavian regime and the East-
ern regime, with the Anglo-Saxon regime tending to have
a higher prevalence of edentulousness, and a lower prev-
alence of lack of functional dentition compared with the

Oral health by welfare regimes in Europe 171
Bismarckian and Southern regimes. Analyses by sex
indicated significant differences between men and women
in the prevalence of no functional dentition in the
Anglo-Saxon welfare regime and for edentulousness in
the Eastern welfare regime. In the Anglo-Saxon coun-
tries, 39.6% (95% CI: 33.9­45.3%) of men, but only
24.9% (95% CI: 20.5­29.3%) of women, did not have a
functional dentition. Women in the Eastern welfare
regime tended to have a higher prevalence (25.1%; 95%
CI: 22.6­27.6%) of edentulousness compared with men
(20.2%; 95% CI: 17.1­23.4%).
The Scandinavian and Bismarckian welfare regimes
showed the lowest prevalence rates for oral impacts on
quality of life, whilst the Southern welfare regime
exhibited the highest (Fig. 1). The Scandinavian regime
had a significantly lower prevalence of oral impacts
than all other welfare regimes, except for the Bismarc-
kian. Analyses by sex showed that women had a signifi-
cantly higher prevalence of oral impacts compared with
men in the Bismarckian (22.1%; 95% CI: 20.2­24% for
women vs. 17%; 95% CI: 15.2­18.9% for men) and
also in the Eastern (28.5%; 95% CI: 26.3­30.7% for
women vs. 22.3%; 95% CI: 19.8­24.8% for men) wel-
fare regimes. In the other welfare regimes, women also
tended to have higher prevalence rates compared with
men, although the differences were not significant.
Additionally, we compared the prevalence rates of oral
impacts using different frequency thresholds. When
cases were defined as those that reported `often' in at
least one oral impact, the general pattern was similar to
that observed in Fig. 1C, with the only exception being
the Bismarckian regime, which exhibited a slightly
higher estimate compared with the Anglo-Saxon
regime. In this case, the prevalence rates ranged from
4% in the Scandinavian welfare regime to 6.4% in the
Southern welfare regime. The proportion of people
reporting `from time to time' in at least one impact ran-
ged from 16.8% in the Scandinavian and Bismarckian
regimes to 28.4% in the Southern regime.
Discussion
Our results support the idea that a welfare regime with
more redistributive and universal welfare policies would
result in better population oral health. Notably, we
found better performance for the Scandinavian welfare
regime in all oral health outcomes considered. In addi-
tion, complementary analyses, conducted as part of this
study using other welfare state typologies (KORPI AND
PALME (38), NAVARRO & SHI (39), and BAMBRA (40)),
found consistent results in terms of the Scandinavian
(social democratic) countries, showing significantly
lower prevalences for edentulousness and lack of func-
tional dentition (results not shown). In contrast, the
analyses reported in this paper showed that the Eastern
welfare regime had the highest prevalence rates for
these two outcomes, whilst the respective prevalence
rates did not vary significantly among the Anglo-
Saxon, Bismarckian, and Southern regimes. The preva-
lence of impacts of oral conditions on daily life was
highest in the Southern regime and lowest in the Scan-
dinavian and Bismarckian regimes.
Our findings are in line with previous studies show-
ing that the Scandinavian (social democratic) welfare
state regime (2, 6, 7, 12, 41, 42) has a protective influ-
ence on health. Scandinavian countries have lower
infant mortality, higher life expectancy, and lower rates
of limiting long-standing illness and poor self-rated
health (5­7, 12, 15, 41, 42). These findings for general
health have been attributed to the more generous and
universal welfare provisions in the Scandinavian welfare
regime and the cumulative effect of its strong redistrib-
utive social security system (2, 7, 15, 43). Better popula-
tion health in Scandinavian countries could also be
related to their health policies. They explicitly target
the social determinants of health (44) and have a large
number of universal health-care services with a high
level of decommodification (40). The consistency of our
findings with those for general health suggests that the
mechanisms linking general health and broad social
determinants are also relevant to oral health. In addi-

tion, because both edentulousness and lack of func-
tional dentition are cumulative measures of lifetime
oral health (45­47), it could be argued that the
observed effects of the Scandinavian welfare regime on
oral health may operate through diverse mechanisms
over the life course.
We found that the Eastern welfare regime had signifi-
cantly higher prevalences of edentulousness and no
functional dentition compared with other regimes.
Some previous studies have also found worse popula-
tion health status in Eastern states (15, 28, 41). This
indicates that the extensive social and political changes
experienced by people in the Eastern European coun-
tries could have had a negative effect on their oral
health, similarly to the observed effect for general
health outcomes. Further research with longitudinal
data from Eastern countries is needed to confirm this
hypothesis. In addition, our findings showed a signifi-
cantly higher prevalence of edentulousness among
women than among men in the Eastern regime, which
might be partially explained by the marked intergender
gap in life expectancy in Eastern countries (48).
Cultural differences could account for some of the
variation in the results between welfare regimes
observed in our analyses. For oral impacts on quality
of life, cultural factors may partially explain why the
Southern regime showed the highest prevalence. It has
been argued that higher levels of health complaints
found in southern European subjects could be related
to cultural issues, such as greater expression of emo-
tions, compared with subjects from other areas of
Europe (13, 28). A previous study comparing oral impacts
on quality of life in people  65 yr of age in Britain and
Greece indicated cultural effects in the perception of
impacts of oral conditions on quality of life (49). The
other two oral health outcomes are less likely to differ
because of cultural reasons as they are based on the num-
ber of natural teeth. However, it is still possible that these
measures reveal some cultural differences in the value
placed on tooth retention, as reported in previous studies
(50, 51). Moreover, variation in loss of natural teeth could
also be partly attributed to different approaches in dental
care practice.
This analysis has strengths worth mentioning. To our
knowledge, it is the first study to analyse the effect of
different welfare state regimes on oral health status in a
wide range of European countries. The macro compar-
ative design, used in this analysis, allows us to assess
political determinants that are usually homogeneous
within nations (17). Also, by using the same source of
information, this analysis has an advantage in terms of
precision and comparability as the surveys used the
same methodology and time lag for all countries. In
addition, the oral health measures considered in our
analyses represent different dimensions of oral health.
The number of natural teeth can be considered as a
measure of lifetime oral health because it captures the
cumulative effect of different social determinants of oral
health (45­47). On the other hand, the impacts on daily
life indicate how clinical oral health affects people phys-
ically, psychologically, and socially (52).
The study has limitations that should be considered
when interpreting the results. First, the sample sizes are
similar for countries with different populations. How-
ever, the population size weighting factor used in all
analyses corrected for this, as each country is repre-
sented in the analyses according to its population size.
Second, we do acknowledge that surveys of this nature
which are carried out across many different countries
are subject to varying measurement error, which may
partly influence the results. Third, data for Norway
(Scandinavian regime) and Switzerland (Bismarckian
regime) were not available, which could have modified
some estimates. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the
inclusion of data from these two countries would have
considerably altered the general findings. Fourth, the
oral health outcomes were self-reported. It has been
argued that differences in health perceptions could
undermine the validity of cross-national comparisons
which are based on self-reported measures (53, 54).
However, the suitability of subjective health measures
for cross-national comparisons has been demonstrated
(36, 55, 56). Moreover, self-reported oral health mea-
sures are significantly associated with clinical dental
measures and are considered to be valid indicators of
oral health (57­60). Finally, the study did not include
data on the use or need for prostheses, which would
have been a relevant variable considering the outcomes
used. Apart from the aforementioned cultural influ-
ences, differences in oral impacts on quality of life can
partly reflect variations in access and use of dental care
services.
It should also be acknowledged that there is no gen-
eral consensus about an `ideal' welfare regime typology.
Based on the existing literature, we included, in the
analyses, only countries that have previously been clas-
sified in one of the Ferrera's welfare regimes or the
additional Eastern type, thereby excluding countries
not classified under this typology. We used Ferrera's
typology because it accounts for theoretical and meth-
odological weaknesses of previous classifications and it
categorizes countries based on different aspects of the
welfare provision, and therefore various recent studies
have used it to analyse variations in population health
and health inequalities (12, 27, 29, 32, 34, 35, 55).
In conclusion, we found significant differences in
adults' oral health between welfare state regimes. Our
results suggest that characteristics of the Scandinavian
countries (particularly Sweden), such as the generosity
and universalism of their welfare state benefits, appear
to be linked to better oral health outcomes. Also, the
Eastern regime showed the highest prevalence rates for
edentulousness and no functional dentition, and the
Southern regime showed the highest prevalence rate for
oral impacts. This is a descriptive study based on
macro-level international comparisons and it should be
considered as an initial contribution to research on
political factors and oral health. By including more
social, economic, and political health-care system char-
acteristic variables, future research could gain further
understanding on the mechanisms by which welfare-
state types influence oral health.
