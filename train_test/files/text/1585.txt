Atrial Fibrillation Mortality, 1980­1998 Wattigney et al.
Increased Atrial Fibrillation Mortality: United States, 1980­1998
Wendy A. Wattigney, George A. Mensah, and Janet B. Croft
The authors used death certificate data to evaluate national trends in the reporting of atrial fibrillation as an
underlying or contributory cause of death for groups defined by age (45 years or older), sex, and race (Black vs.
White) and to examine comorbidity. The multiple-causes mortality files from 1980 through 1998 were analyzed
for decedents, with atrial fibrillation (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 427.3) listed
as one of up to 20 conditions causing death. The number of decedents with atrial fibrillation increased from
18,947 in 1980 to 61,946 in 1998, and the proportion with atrial fibrillation reported as the underlying cause of
death rose from 8.3% in 1980 to 11.6% in 1998. Age-standardized death rates from 1980 to 1998 were
consistently highest among White men, followed (in descending order) by White women, Black men, and Black
women. Overall, the age-standardized rate (per 100,000) increased from 27.6 in 1980 to 69.8 in 1998 (an
average annual increase of 5.4%, p < 0.0001). Ischemic heart disease was the most frequent underlying cause
of death among decedents with atrial fibrillation (26.8%). These findings emphasize the need for increased
application of proven prevention and control measures to decrease associated cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. Am J Epidemiol 2002;155:819­26.

Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained heart
rhythm disturbance in humans, affects an estimated 2.2 mil-
lion adults in the United States alone (1, 2). It accounts for
nearly one in three hospital discharges in which a cardiac
arrhythmia is listed as the principal diagnosis (3).
Epidemiologic cohort studies have shown that the preva-
lence of atrial fibrillation increases markedly with age in
older adults, from less than 1 percent for those younger than
age 60 years to roughly 10 percent for persons aged 80 or
older (1, 2, 4, 5). In the Framingham Heart Study cohort,
men had a higher prevalence than women regardless of age
and examination year. Secular trends from 1968 to 1989
among Framingham subjects aged 65­84 years showed an
increase in prevalence of atrial fibrillation from 3.2 to 9.1
percent in men and from 2.8 to 4.7 percent in women (4). In
a recent study of health maintenance organization enrollees,
the prevalence of diagnosed atrial fibrillation among per-
sons aged 50 years or older was higher in Whites than in
Blacks (2.2 vs. 1.5 percent, p < 0.001) (2). Atrial fibrillation
is an important marker for the presence of other cardiovas-
cular diseases and a powerful independent predictor of mor-
bidity and mortality (6).
Atrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for stroke,
with the attributable risk increasing with age to about 25 per-
cent for adults aged 80 years or older (7). A report from the
Framingham Heart Study (8) identified risk factors for
chronic or transient atrial fibrillation after 38 years of follow-
up. These included male sex, age, congestive heart failure,
valvular heart disease, a history of myocardial infarction,
hypertension, and diabetes (8). In the Cardiovascular Health
Study, left atrial size was also a strong independent predictor
of incidence during 3 years of follow-up, a finding that sug-
gests a cause for, not a consequence of, atrial fibrillation (9).
Levels of blood pressure and glucose were also more impor-
tant as predictors than was diagnosis of high blood pressure
and diabetes (9).
Much of our knowledge of the prognosis and predispos-
ing conditions for atrial fibrillation is provided by cohort
studies and is based on predominantly White cohorts.
National mortality patterns in population groups defined by
race, sex, and age have not been reported. Multiple-cause
mortality files for 1980­1998 provide an opportunity to
evaluate not only national trends in reporting the presence of
atrial fibrillation as a cause of death in the US population but
also the frequency of coexisting conditions contributing to
death.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, compiles data on all deaths
occurring annually in the United States from vital records of
820 Wattigney et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 155, No. 9, 2002
states and the District of Columbia (10, 11). Public use data
files contain the underlying cause, up to 19 additional con-
tributing causes, and demographic data. At the state vital
statistics office, information from death certificates is
entered into electronic records. All of the diseases and con-
ditions reported on death certificates from 1979 through
1998 used codes from the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) (12). The underlying
cause of death is the disease (or injury) that initiated the
sequence of events leading directly to death. Usually, the
underlying cause of death is the condition reported on the
lowest line in part I of the death certificate. In some cases,
however, the interpretations of individual physicians are
overruled on the basis of international selection and modifi-
cation rules to select a condition of greater public interest or
to correct for poor reporting practices (10). In this report,
atrial fibrillation is defined for decedents with ICD-9 code
427.3 mentioned as either the underlying cause or as a con-
tributory (any one of the possible 20 conditions on the death
certificate) cause of death. This code includes both atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter.
We limited the National Center for Health Statistics
multiple-cause mortality data to deaths occurring in the 50
states and the District of Columbia among US residents. We
describe trends from 1980 through 1998 in the annual num-
ber and age-standardized rate of decedents aged 45 years or
older with atrial fibrillation reported as one of up to 20 con-
ditions on the death certificate, the age distribution, and the
percentage of persons with atrial fibrillation reported as the
underlying cause of death. Persons aged less than 45 years
accounted for less than 0.2 percent of all decedents with
atrial fibrillation.
Age-standardized death rates were estimated by race
(Black and White) and sex for atrial fibrillation as a multi-
ple cause using 2-year intervals from 1981 through 1998.
All races other than Black or White combined contributed to
approximately 1 percent of decedents with atrial fibrillation.
Detailed race groups were too few to provide comparable
results. Projections of the US resident population by age,
sex, and race from the US Bureau of the Census were used
to calculate age-, race-, and sex-specific death rates per
100,000 US population. Death rates were age standardized
using the direct method for adjustment to the year 2000
standard population aged 45 years and older (13). Annual
percentage changes in death rates were estimated with log-
linear regression (14). Age-specific death rates for White
and for Black adults were estimated with the use of 2-year
intervals from 1981 through 1998.
For 1994­1998 aggregate data, the distribution of disease
categories (ICD-9 codes 001.0­799.9, a range that excludes
external causes of injury and poisoning) reported as the
underlying cause of death was examined among decedents
aged 45 or more years with atrial fibrillation by age (45­64
years and 65 years) and by race and sex (White men, White
women, Black men, and Black women). Comorbid causes
on death certificates mentioning atrial fibrillation were like-
wise investigated. These analyses did not include decedents
who had an external cause of injury or poisoning coded as
the underlying cause of death (ICD-9 codes 800.0­999.9).
External cause of injury and poisoning were reported as the
underlying cause of death for 0.7 and 1.2 percent of dece-
dents with atrial fibrillation aged 45­64 and 65 or more
years, respectively.
RESULTS
There was an increasing trend from 1980 through 1998 in
multiple-cause death rates for atrial fibrillation among
adults aged 45 or more years (table 1). The number of dece-
dents with atrial fibrillation increased from 18,947 in 1980
to 61,946 in 1998. The age-standardized rate (per 100,000
US population) increased from 27.6 in 1980 to 69.8 in 1998
(an average annual increase of 5.4 percent, p < 0.0001). In
the period 1980­1988, the average annual increase was 3.1
percent compared with 6.2 percent from 1989 to 1998. The
proportion of all decedents with atrial fibrillation who were
aged 85 or more years increased from 34 percent in 1980 to
47 percent in 1998. Of all decedents with atrial fibrillation,
an increasing proportion of persons had atrial fibrillation
reported as the underlying cause of death (from 8.3 percent
in 1980 to 11.6 percent in 1998). From 1980 to 1998, the
race and sex distribution of decedents with atrial fibrillation
remained relatively constant, with almost 94 percent being
White and almost 60 percent being women.
Age-standardized death rates varied between race and sex
groups among adults aged 45 or more years (figure 1). For
atrial fibrillation as the underlying cause of death, death
rates were higher among White than among Black adults.
After 1988, age-standardized death rates for atrial fibrilla-
tion as the underlying cause of death increased linearly with
a greater increase seen among White decedents. A consider-
able White-Black gap is evident in more recent years. The
age-standardized rate (per 100,000) increased from about
2.5 in 1981­1982 to approximately eight and five in
1997­1998 among White and Black adults, respectively.
Similarly, there was a consistent increase from 1981 through
1998 in death rates for atrial fibrillation listed as any condi-
tion on the death certificate among adults aged 45 or more
years. These age-standardized death rates were consistently
highest among White men, followed (in descending order)
by White women, Black men, and Black women. The aver-
age annual increase ranged from 1.2 percent in Black
women to 1.6 percent in White men from 1980 to 1988 and
accelerated to about 5.0 percent in Blacks and 6.5 percent in
Whites from 1988 to 1998.
Age-specific death rates (ages 65­74, 75­84, and 85
years) by race and calendar year show a temporal increase
for each age-race group, with Whites aged 75­84 and 85 or
more years having much higher absolute death rates than did
Blacks in the corresponding age categories for atrial fibrilla-
tion as either the underlying cause or any condition (figure
2). In 1997­1998, the death rate for Whites aged 85 or more
years was twice that for Blacks--97 versus 47 (per 100,000).
The relative increase over time in atrial fibrillation as the
underlying cause of death was consistently greater among
Whites than among Blacks and was most pronounced in those
aged 85 or more years (294 percent in Whites and 140 per-
cent in Blacks). Racial differences were not observed in the

were close to zero.
The distribution of disease categories that were coded as
the underlying cause of death for 1994 through 1998 for all
decedents with atrial fibrillation did not differ markedly by
age (table 2). Specific disease categories and subcategories
that were frequent by at least 5.0 percent within an age
group are presented. Diseases of the circulatory system were
the most common cause of death (62.3 percent among dece-
dents aged 45­64 years and 68.6 percent among those aged
65 years). Among these circulatory system diseases,

ischemic heart disease was the most frequent underlying
cause of death (23.4 percent for ages 45­64 years and 27.2
percent for ages 65). Ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrilla-
tion and flutter, and cerebrovascular disease were slightly
more common among decedents aged 65 or more years than
among those aged 45­64 years. In the younger age cohort,
neoplasms, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy were more fre-
quent as the underlying cause of death.
The distribution of disease categories that were coded as
the underlying cause of death for 1994­1998 for all dece-
dents with atrial fibrillation also differed slightly by race and
sex (table 3). Race groups other than White or Black were
too few in number (3,129; 1.2 percent) to provide compara-
ble results. Table 3 lists specific disease categories and sub-
categories that were frequent (at least 5 percent) within a
race-sex group. Ischemic heart disease was the most fre-
quent underlying cause of death among persons who had
atrial fibrillation as one of up to 20 conditions listed on the
death certificate. Deceased women had a higher prevalence
of circulatory system diseases reported as the underlying
cause of death than did men (71.2 vs. 64.0 percent), includ-
ing atrial fibrillation (approximately 13 percent vs. approxi-
mately 10 percent), while men had a higher prevalence of
neoplasms (12­13 vs. approximately 7 percent).

gated from 1994 through 1998. More than 84 percent of
decedents in each age group (data not shown) and race/sex
group (table 4) had at least one disease of the circulatory
system other than atrial fibrillation listed on their death cer-
tificate. Among these, hypertensive disease, ischemic heart
disease, cardiac arrest, heart failure, and cerebrovascular
disease were prominent in all groups. Hypertensive disease
was notably more frequent in Blacks than in Whites (30 vs.
19 percent). Diseases of the respiratory system, particularly
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accompanied atrial
fibrillation in a greater percentage of men than women (35
vs. 25 percent). Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic dis-
eases and immunity disorders, particularly diabetes, were
comorbidities for roughly 20 percent of decedents with
atrial fibrillation. Diabetes was a coexisting condition at
death for a greater percentage of persons aged 45­64 years
than for those aged 65 or more years (19 vs. 12 percent, data
not shown) and was slightly more prevalent among Black
female decedents (16 vs. 11­13 percent).
DISCUSSION
Atrial fibrillation affects primarily persons aged 75 years
or more. Age-standardized rates (per 100,000 US popula-
tion) of decedents with atrial fibrillation have increased
overall from 27.6 in 1980 to 69.8 in 1998. White men con-
sistently had the highest age-standardized rate over time,
followed (in descending order) by White women, Black
men, and Black women. Age-specific rates by race showed
that White decedents aged 85 or more years had twice the
rate for atrial fibrillation as that associated with death than
Blacks; in 1997­1998, the rates were 749 versus 363 per
100,000 population, respectively. The proportional mortal-
ity (number of deaths associated with atrial fibrillation
divided by the total deaths) also increased over time and was
greatest for White women, who tend to live longer (data not
shown).
The observed increase in mortality associated with atrial
fibrillation sharply contrasts with the decline in death rates
since the midcentury from most heart diseases, such as
coronary heart disease, hypertensive disease, and rheumatic
disease (15). Prolonged survival with diseases associated
with atrial fibrillation, such as coronary heart disease,
ischemic heart disease, and hypertensive disease, may have
resulted in more cases of atrial fibrillation. As the proportion
of elderly adults in the US population increases, atrial fibril-
lation will continue to be a more frequent diagnosis. Another
factor that contributes to the increase in mortality associated
atrial fibrillation is the growing prevalence of diabetes mel-
litus among older persons (16). With the higher prevalence
of atrial fibrillation and associated clinical cardiovascular
diseases among older adults and the contemporary appreci-
ation of the importance of anticoagulation therapy in pre-
venting stroke, both incidence and recognition of atrial
fibrillation have grown and will likely continue to increase
over time.
Investigators for a Danish hospital-based study noted a
decrease from 1980 to 1993 of 12­13 percent for total mor-
tality in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, hospital
discharges for atrial fibrillation increased over the same
period (17). The number of hospitalizations related to atrial
fibrillation in Scotland has also increased dramatically in

Interestingly, nearly half of the patients admitted to Danish
hospitals with atrial fibrillation had ischemic heart disease;
hypertension was seen in fewer than 20 percent. By contrast,
population-based studies have suggested that hypertension
was the most common underlying medical problem in
patients with atrial fibrillation (8). The observed decrease in
mortality for patients with atrial fibrillation suggests that
hospital-based analyses may not represent a true reflection
of mortality. There is some speculation that the risk of in-
hospital death declined due to changes in admission and dis-
charge practices with a tendency toward earlier discharges
to nursing homes and convalescent facilities. Furthermore,
contemporary data from large, population-based surveys of
atrial fibrillation are needed to examine the impact of
comorbid conditions on the treatment and management of
atrial fibrillation.
The increase in reporting of atrial fibrillation as an under-
lying cause or a multiple cause on the death certificate was
gradual from 1980 to 1988 and much greater thereafter.

Atrial Fibrillation Mortality, 1980­1998 825
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 155, No. 9, 2002
Notably, the US Standard Certificate of Death was revised
in 1989 to improve the quality of mortality data. Added
instructions about cause of death stated, "Do not enter the
mode of dying, such as cardiac or respiratory arrest, shock,
or heart failure." However, heart failure and cardiac arrest
were listed as a coexisting conditions at death for approxi-
mately 30 and 16 percent, respectively, of decedents with
atrial fibrillation. It is possible that the instruction about
cardiac arrest and heart failure influenced reporting of atrial
fibrillation as the underlying cause. The 1989 revised death
certificate probably did not affect the increasing trend in
deaths with atrial fibrillation listed as a contributory cause,
however. Medicare data indicate a similar increasing trend
between 1991 and 1998 in the prevalence of hospitalizations
of patients with atrial fibrillation (19). The availability of
more advanced diagnostic tools such as ultrasound and elec-
trographic monitoring likely contribute to the increased
diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
Regardless of the underlying cause, approximately 87
percent of all decedents had at least one disease of the cir-
culatory system other than atrial fibrillation listed on the
death certificate. Ischemic heart disease was one of the lead-
ing comorbidities and was observed more often among
White (37 percent) than among Black (30 percent) dece-
dents. Cerebrovascular disease/stroke was a coexisting con-
dition contributing to death in approximately 27 percent of
male decedents and 34 percent of female decedents.
Hypertensive disease as a comorbid condition was more fre-
quent among Blacks than among Whites (30 vs. 19 percent,
respectively). Diseases of the respiratory system and neo-
plasms were more common among male than among female
decedents. These coexisting conditions contributing to death
reflect the independent risk factors predisposing to the
development of atrial fibrillation identified in population-
based cohort studies (8, 9) and concomitant diagnoses
observed in hospital-based studies (17, 18).
The quality and completeness of the mortality data from
the vital statistics system is a major strength of this study.
That data source is unmatched in terms of universal coverage
and standardization. Information that the national vital statis-
tics system provides is often used in state and national initia-
tives to influence and target the direction of public health
efforts. The widespread use of these data, however, has
raised questions regarding the reliability and validity of
cause-of-death information from the death certificate (20,
21). There is some lack of precision in cause-of-death speci-
fications by physicians and of biases in the data on the under-
lying cause of death due to the coding protocols used. A
limitation of the multiple-cause mortality records is that there
is no verification of the death certificate data. There is also a
general lack of resources to conduct cause-of-death queries
with the certifying physician to clarify illegible, imprecise, or
nonspecific entries. The reliability and accuracy of underly-
ing cause depends on the medical certifier of each death as
well as on automated software and the state and national
nosologists who determine the codes and underlying cause.
The observations presented indicate that death associated
with atrial fibrillation has risen and will likely continue to
rise. As the elderly population in the United States increases
in size, the public health burden of atrial fibrillation will
assume more importance. In a prospective cohort study of
hospitalized Medicare patients, the net impact of atrial
fibrillation on mortality, stroke, and medical costs was stud-
ied (22). Total Medicare spending was greater in patients
with than in those without atrial fibrillation (9­23 percent
greater in men and 10­11 percent greater in women).
Treatment of hypertension and diabetes and prevention of
other cardiovascular diseases associated with atrial fibrilla-
tion may help reduce its prevalence. Anticoagulants have
been shown to reduce stroke by 68 percent in eligible
patients with atrial fibrillation (23). Nevertheless, a recent
study in the United Kingdom suggests that only 23 percent
of atrial fibrillation patients use anticoagulants and that use
was lowest among elderly women, who might benefit the
most (24).
The frequency with which atrial fibrillation is reported on
death certificates as a contributory cause of mortality has
increased in the United States over the last 2 decades. This
trend is likely to continue as the US population ages. Effective
anticoagulation, heart rate control, and conversion of atrial
fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm are expected to decrease
cardiovascular complications. Prevention of atrial fibrillation
in the first place, through the identification of modifiable risk
factors and their effective treatment and control in those at
risk for developing this condition, must be pursued and rec-
ognized as complementary management strategies for reduc-
ing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
