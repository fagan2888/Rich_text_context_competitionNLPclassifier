Abstract
Background. Dietary phosphorus intake is usually re-
stricted in dialysis patients but the associations of dietary
phosphorus intake with mortality in moderate chronic kid-
ney disease (CKD) are unknown. Therefore, we examined
these associations in National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey III.
Methods. Dietary phosphorus intake was estimated from 24-h
dietary recalls administered by trained personnel. CKD was
defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60
mL/min/1.73 m2. Time to mortality was examined by Cox re-
gression models taking into account the complex survey design.
Results. 1105 adults with CKD were studied. Phosphorus
intake was 1033 6 482 mg/day (mean 6 SD), eGFR was
49.3 6 9.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum phosphorus was
3.5 6 0.5 mg/dL. Compared to those in the lowest tertile
of phosphorus intake (mean 532 6 161 mg/day), those
in the highest third (1478 6 378 mg/day) had similar
serum phosphorus levels (3.6 6 0.5 versus 3.5 6 0.6
mg/dL, P ¼ 0.113) and modestly higher eGFR (50.0 6
8.1 versus 47.5 6 12.0 mL/min/1.73 m2, P ¼ 0.014).
After adjustment for demographics, comorbidity, eGFR,
physical activity, energy intake and nutritional variables,
phosphorus intake was not associated with mortality

[hazard ratio (HR) 0.98 per 100 mg/dL increase, 0.93­
1.03].
Conclusions. High dietary phosphorus intake is not asso-
ciated with increased mortality in moderate CKD, presum-
ably because serum phosphorus levels are maintained in the
normal range at this level of GFR. Interventional trials are
needed to define optimal phosphorus intake in moderate
CKD.

Introduction
Phosphorus is a critically important mineral, playing a vital
role in energy metabolism, cellular signaling, nucleic acid
metabolism, platelet aggregation and bone mineralization.
An average adult contains <1 kg of phosphorus in the
body. About 85% of that is present in bones and teeth in
the form of apatitie, and the most of the remainder is inside
cells in soft tissues. Only ~0.1% of body phosphate circu-
lates in the blood. A well-fed healthy adult consumes
~1.5 g of phosphorus/day and about two-thirds of that is
excreted in the urine and the rest in the feces.
The serum phosphorus level is influenced by dietary
intake, gastrointestinal absorption, distribution across the
body compartments including uptake into bone and excre-
tion [1]. Regulation of serum phosphorus levels involves
vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and fibroblast-derived
growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Increased serum phosphorus
concentrations are associated with vascular calcification
[2] and mortality in dialysis patients [3­6]. Reduction in
dietary phosphorus intake by avoiding foods high in phos-
phorus such as colas or dairy products is considered critical
in controlling serum phosphorus in dialysis population.
Thus, the national guidelines recommend reduction in diet-
ary phosphorus intake in dialysis patients.
As glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines to about
40­45 mL/min/1.73 m2, urinary excretion of phosphorus
decreases and serum levels of phosphorus begin to increase
[7, 8]. More recently, in non-dialysis-dependent chronic
kidney disease (CKD) patients, higher serum phosphorus
levels have been shown to be associated with increased
mortality [9, 10]. These data raise the possibility that higher
dietary phosphorus intake might be associated with in-
creased mortality in non-dialysis CKD. To our knowledge,
there are no prior studies on the associations of dietary
phosphorus with mortality in moderate CKD. Therefore,
we examined these associations in the moderate CKD pop-
ulation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) III data.
Methods
Study population and baseline data
The NHANES is an ongoing series of the surveys of the non-institution-
alized civilian population in the USA conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics. From 1988 to 1994, NHANES III, a cross-sectional
survey of the US population was carried out. It used a complex, multistage
sampling design to obtain a sample that is representative of the non-
institutionalized civilian US population of early 1990s [11].
Briefly, participants provided informed consent and underwent a
structured home interview conducted by trained personnel to ascertain
self-reported medical history of conditions such as myocardial infarction,
stroke, congestive heart failure and diabetes. This was followed by a
physical examination, which included blood pressure measurement,
extensive anthropometric and physiological assessments and blood draw
for laboratory testing [11] at the NHANES Mobile Examination Center.
The time of the blood draw and the number of hours of fasting before the
blood draw were recorded. As detailed below, during this visit, partic-
ipants also underwent a detailed diet interview.
Serum creatinine, albumin, calcium and phosphorus were analyzed on a
Hitachi 737 automated analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN) using reagents from Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics.
Serum creatinine measurements obtained using a kinetic rate Jaffe method
in NHANES III were recalibrated to standardized creatinine measurements
obtained at the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory (Cleveland, OH) as
standard creatinine ¼ À0.184 1 0.960 3 NHANES III measured serum
creatinine [12]. GFR was estimated as 175 3 (standardized serum crea-
tinine)À1.154 3 (age)À0.203 3 0.742 (if the individual is woman) 3 1.212
(if the individual is African-American) [13]. CKD was defined as GFR
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Dietary assessment
Details about dietary assessment methodology have been published else-
where [11]. A computer-based interview system developed by the Uni-
versity of Minnesota's Nutrition Coordinating Center (Regents of the
University of Minnesota) was used to conduct a 24-h dietary recall. The
24-h dietary recall was conducted by trained interviewers. The US Depart-
ment of Agriculture's Survey Nutrient Data Base was used to calculate
macro- and micronutrient content of the foods consumed during the 24-h
recall period for each respondent.
Nutritional assessment
A trained technician carried out anthropometric measurements, while
another trained technician assisted and recorded the measures. Weight
was measured to the nearest 0.01 kg on an electronic scale. Standing height
was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a stadiometer. Bioimpedance
analysis (BIA) model 1990B (Valhalla Scientific, San Diego, CA) was
used for the measurement of whole body electrical resistance and impe-
dance. A standardized protocol for BIA procedure was carried out by
trained observers and physicians in a standardized environment. Lean
body mass (LBM) was estimated from prediction equations that were
validated and cross-validated for men and women separately and for
blacks and whites between the ages of 12 and 94 years. [men: LBM
(kg) ¼ À10.68 1 (0.65 3 S2/resistance) 1 (0.26 3 weight) 1 (0.02 3
resistance) and women: LBM (kg) ¼ À9.53 1 (0.69 3 S2/resistance)1
(0.17 3 weight) 1 (0.02 3 resistance) where S2/resistance is stature
squared divided by resistance (cm2/X)] [14].
Follow-up data
The National Center for Health Statistics created an NHANES III Linked
Mortality File that contains mortality follow-up data from the date of
NHANES III survey participation (1988­1994) through December 31,
2000. This information was based upon the results from a probabilistic
match between NHANES III and National Death Index death certificate
records [15].
Statistical analyses
NHANES III utilized a complex multistage probability sample design.
Several aspects of the NHANES design must be taken into account in data
analysis, including the sampling weights and clustered sampling. We used
the svy suite of commands in Stata 11 (Stata 11, College station, TX) and
followed the analytical guidelines for NHANES data proposed by the
Centers for Disease Control [16]. The svy commands in Stata accounts
for the elements of NHANES sampling design to calculate the expected
means and proportions of the entire US non-institutionalized civilian CKD
population, which are presented with the estimated values and with asso-
ciated 95% confidence intervals.
Using gender-specific tertiles, unadjusted associations of dietary phos-
phorus intake with baseline characteristics including dietary variables
(calorie, protein, calcium and magnesium intake), nutritional variables
(serum albumin and LBM) and serum calcium, phosphorus and
Dietary phosphorus and mortality 991
calcium­phosphorus product were examined using chi-square contin-
gency table analysis for categorical variables and analysis of variance
for continuous variables.
In a multivariable linear regression model, the association of dietary
phosphorus with serum phosphorus was examined adjusted for demo-
graphics (age, gender and race), dietary variables (calorie intake and percent
calories from protein), time of the day (morning: 7:00­11:59 AM, afternoon:
12:00­4:49 PM and evening: 5:00­11:00 PM) when the blood was drawn
and the hours of fasting before the blood was drawn.
Survival analyses
The unadjusted association of dietary phosphorus intake with mortality
was first examined in a Cox proportional hazards regression model without
covariate adjustment. Next, this model was adjusted for age, gender and
race to examine the extent to which demographic variables confound this
association. A third Cox regression model was performed with further
covariate adjustment for comorbid conditions (history of myocardial
infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer and diabetes), lifestyle
factors (smoking, alcohol use and physical activity), dietary variables
(calorie intake and percent calories from protein) and estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). Finally, as higher phosphorus intake might be
associated with better nutritional status, the effects of further adjusting
for nutritional variables [serum albumin, body mass index (BMI) and
LBM] were examined in a fourth Cox regression model.
The assumption of proportional hazards was examined by comparing
the logarithm of the hazard ratio (HR) for each predictor variable in the
first 3 years of follow-up to the logarithm of the HR of the predictor
variables after Year 3. No models showed proportional hazards assump-
tion violations with respect to dietary phosphorus intake.
The factors gender and stroke exhibited a significant deviation from
proportional hazards (P < 0.05) in at least one of the models. Hence, rather
than including these factors as covariates, each of the Cox regressions was
stratified by each of these factors to allow separate baseline hazard func-
tions within each stratum. In addition, quadratic terms were tested for each
continuous covariate to test for the presence of nonlinear effects of that
covariate. No quadratic terms were statistically significant.
Similar analyses were performed treating dietary phosphorus intake as
a categorical variable with the lowest dietary phosphorus intake as the
reference group.
Results
Of the 16 864 adults with valid data for GFR estimation,
the subpopulation of 1105 CKD participants with nonmiss-
ing data for dietary intake, nutritional variables and mortal-
ity were included in this analysis.
Higher phosphorus intake was associated with younger
age and non-African-American race (Table 1). GFR was
modestly higher in the higher phosphorus intake group.
There was a very small but statistically significant differ-
ence in calcium­phosphorus product.

As is expected, higher phosphorus intake was associ-
ated with higher intake of protein, energy, calcium and
magnesium intake (Table 2). Of the anthropometric meas-
ures, higher phosphorus intake was associated with
higher estimated LBM but not BMI or serum albumin
(Table 2).
Dietary phosphorus was weakly associated with serum
phosphorus after adjustment for demographics, calorie in-
take, percent calories from protein intake, time of blood
draw and duration of fasting. A 100 mg/day increase in
dietary phosphorus was associated with a corresponding
change in serum phosphorus of 0.009 mg/dL (95% confi-
dence limits: 0.006­0.011 mg/dL, Table 3).
There were 592 (54%) deaths over an average of 6.5years
of follow-up. The unadjusted hazard of death was lower with
higher phosphorus intake (Figure 1). As shown in Figure 2,
adjustment for age, gender and race attenuated the decrease in
the HRs associated with higher phosphorus intake. Adjust-
ment for comorbid conditions, eGFR, smoking, alcohol use,
physical activity levels and energy intake further attenuated
this association. Adjustment for nutritional status eliminated
the lower hazard of mortality associated with high phosphorus
intake.
The associations of phosphorus intake as a categorical
variable with mortality were similar (Table 4).
Discussion
The results of the current study suggest that high dietary
phosphorus levels are associated with very modest increase
in serum phosphorus levels but not with increased mortality
in early-stage III CKD. However, high dietary phosphorus
is positively associated with LBM and intake of energy,
protein, calcium and magnesium.
Higher levels of serum phosphorus was associated with
increased risk of mortality in advanced CKD [9, 10] as well
as hemodialysis patients [3, 5]. Furthermore, higher serum
phosphorus levels were associated with lower ankle-
brachial index (a marker of peripheral arterial disease) in
individuals with normal kidney function or moderate kid-
ney disease [17], increased risk of cardiovascular disease in
individuals with eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and without
proteinuria [18], and increased risk of stroke and death in
healthy community-dwelling adults [19]. Therefore, there
is much interest in strategies to reduce serum phosphorus
(either by decreasing dietary intake of phosphorus or use of
phosphorus binders) not only in dialysis population but
also in those with CKD [20­22].
Even though the above studies of serum phosphorus
provide a strong rationale for targeting dietary phosphorus
in advanced stages of kidney disease, there is a paucity of
data on whether dietary phosphorus by itself is a risk factor
for poor outcomes in those with normal kidney function
or mild kidney dysfunction. In an earlier analysis of
NHANES III data, there were no associations of dietary
phosphorus with serum phosphorus in non institutionalized
US general population [23]. Antoniucci et al. [24] con-
ducted a rigorous 4-week interventional study of dietary
phosphorus in 13 healthy men. In that study, participants
were admitted to a General Clinical Research Center
and consumed a constant diet that provided 500 mg of
phosphorus per day, which was supplemented to achieve
three phosphorus intakes, each of 9 days duration:control
¼ 1500 mg/day, supplemented ¼ 2300 mg/day and
restricted ¼ 625 mg/day. Intakes of calcium, sodium,
potassium, magnesium, and energy were constant. Diet-
ary phosphorus intervention had no effects on serum
phosphorus levels. Therefore, there is no clear evidence
to support the notion that dietary phosphorus manipula-
tion will impact on serum phosphorus levels in those
with normal kidney function or those with moderate
CKD.
Nonetheless, independent of serum phosphorus levels,
high dietary phosphorus could have deleterious consequen-
ces through other mechanisms. In the phosphorus interven-
tion study described above, high dietary phosphorus intake
resulted in increased serum levels of FGF-23 [24]. In-
creased serum levels of FGF-23 have been shown to be
independently associated with endothelial dysfunction
[25], coronary artery disease [26], left ventricular hyper-
trophy [27] and mortality [28] in CKD or dialysis patients.
Apart from its effects on serum FGF-23 levels, high dietary
phosphorus could affect outcomes through other mecha-
nisms. For instance, in vitro, bovine aortic endothelial cells
exposed to a phosphorus load increased production of
reactive oxygen species and decreased nitric oxide produc-
tion [29]. Furthermore, flow-mediated dilation of the
brachial artery was significantly decreased by dietary
phosphorus load in healthy volunteers [29]. Apart from
cardiovascular disease, high dietary phosphorus intake
could also increase progression of kidney disease as uremic

Dietary phosphorus and mortality 993
rats fed with low phosphorus diet had slower progression of
kidney disease on renal histology [30].
Taken together, the above literature could be interpreted
as evidence that high dietary phosphorus intake could be
deleterious in those with moderate kidney disease. Indeed,
in maintenance hemodialysis patients, high dietary phos-
phorus was associated with increased hazard of death [31].
However, to our knowledge, there are no published data on
whether high dietary phosphorus intake is indeed associ-
ated with increased mortality in moderate CKD.
As GFR declines to about 40­45 mL/min/1.73 m2, uri-
nary excretion of phosphorus decreases and serum levels of
phosphorus begins to increase [7, 8]. In this sample of
people with moderate kidney disease (eGFR, 49.3 Æ 9.5
mL/min/1.73 m2), higher reported dietary phosphorus in-
take was associated with lower hazard of death in unad-
justed models (Table 3 and Figure 2). With adjustment,
dietary phosphorus intake was not significantly associated
with mortality. It is possible that the magnitude of the Cox
regression coefficients for dietary phosphorus were attenu-
ated due to effects of measurement error [32] or short-term
variation in diet. However, because the estimated HRs cor-
responding to higher phosphorous levels were <1 in each
model considered (Figure 2), it is unlikely that attenuation
due to measurement error obscured a direct association of
higher phosphorus with increased mortality. Thus, the
results of this study suggest that spontaneously higher phos-
phorus intake is not associated with increased mortality at
this level of eGFR. It is still conceivable that dietary phos-
phorus restriction might improve outcomes in those with
more advanced CKD with decreased ability to excrete phos-
phorus. Interventional studies are warranted to conclusively
establish the potential benefit or harm of low phosphorus diet
in early-stage III CKD.
Another therapeutic strategy is the use of phosphorus
binders to decrease dietary phosphorus absorption in
those with early stages of CKD and normal serum phos-
phorus levels [33]. In individuals with advanced CKD
(eGFR, 26.3 Æ 15.6 mL/min) and normal serum phospho-
rus (4.5 Æ 0.7 mg/dL), therapy with sevelamer was
associated with decreased progression of coronary calci-
fication compared to individuals treated with a low phos-
phorus diet alone [34]. Since low phosphorus diet was
associated with increased coronary calcification in that
study, the decreased calcification with sevelamer may be
through mechanisms independent of its dietary phospho-
rus-binding effect. Therefore, it is unclear whether dietary
phosphorus restriction would improve coronary calcifica-
tion and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD. In a retrospec-
tive analysis of hemodialysis patients, patients treated
with phosphorus binders were matched with those who
were not treated with phosphorus binders by their baseline
serum phosphate levels and propensity score of receiving
phosphorus binders during the first 90 days [33]. In that
study, therapy with phosphorus binders was independ-
ently associated with lower mortality. This was presum-
ably because phosphorus binders suppressed serum FGF-
23 levels. Similarly, in men with moderate to advanced
non-dialysis CKD, phosphorus binder therapy was asso-
ciated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality which

was most pronounced in men with higher baseline serum
phosphate levels [22]. However, in a small randomized con-
trolled trial of CKD patients, the use of lanthanum, a phos-
phorus binder was associated with decrease in urinary
phosphorus excretion but not that of serum FGF-23 levels
[35]. Thus, it is unclear whether the use of phosphorus bind-
ers in early-stage CKD patients with normal serum phospho-
rus levels would impact on hard end-points.
Higher protein intake is associated with higher phospho-
rus intake. Therefore, zealous restriction of phosphorus
intake might decrease protein intake and adversely affect
nutritional status [36]. Indeed, in this study, higher phos-
phorus intake was associated with higher LBM (Table 2).
Dietary approaches to maximizing nutritional status while
controlling phosphorus intake include maximizing the or-
ganic phosphorus to protein ratio and minimizing inor-
ganic sources [31]. An organic Italian Mediterranean diet
was reported to both decrease serum phosphorus and in-
crease LBM among patients with Stages 2 and 3 kidney
disease [37]. Adjustment of phosphate binder use based on
dietary phosphate intake is reported to result in improved
phosphorus levels in children without influencing
phosphorus intake [22, 33, 35, 38].
Strengths of this study include the representative sam-
ple and rigorous methodology of the NHANES study.
Limitations of the study include the observational nature,
which limits causal inferences. Despite its common use,
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation has
several limitations when used in specific groups and may
result in the over diagnosis of CKD [39]. Furthermore,
there were only single baseline measurements of dietary
intake with a single 24-h recall at baseline. Conventional
nutrient databases may not account for the consumption of
food additives laden with highly bioavailable phosphorus
[40­43], which might result in underestimation of phos-
phorus [36]. Imprecise estimates of dietary phosphorus
intake might bias the study toward null hypothesis. How-
ever, given that the total calorie intake was lower in the
lowest phosphorus group and higher in the highest phos-
phorus group, it is unlikely that there was systematic
underestimation of dietary phosphorus in the low phos-
phorus intake group compared to the high phosphorus
intake group. Fasting durations and time of day in blood
collection varied between participants and these might
affect serum phosphorus levels. However, when adjusted
for these variables, dietary phosphorus had statistically
significant but clinically not meaningful association with
serum phosphorus at this level of eGFR. In addition, there
are no data available in this NHANES dataset on serum
parathyroid hormone or FGF-23 levels.
We conclude that spontaneously higher dietary phospho-
rus intake is not associated with increased mortality in
moderate CKD in the USA. We conjecture that this absence
of association reflects the maintenance of serum phospho-
rus levels in the normal range at this level of GFR. How-
ever, interventional trials are needed to establish the
optimal level of dietary phosphorus intake in moderate
CKD. Demonstration of sustainable dietary and supple-
ment approaches to maximizing nutritional status and phos-
phorus metabolism may play a role in improving both
clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients with CKD.
