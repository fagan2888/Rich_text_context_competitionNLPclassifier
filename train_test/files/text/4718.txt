Margaret Fuller (1810-1850) influenced numerous feminists,
writers, scholars, and social activists from the mid-19th cen-
tury through today (Anthony, 1920; Barrett & Cullinan, 1992;
Capper, 2007; Christensen, 2010; Kester-Shelton, 1996; Knight,
2010; Kunitz & Haycraft, 1938; Sinclair, 1965; Taylor, 1971).
In both similar and different ways, Carl Jung (1875-1961)
challenged many scholars, psychologists, psychiatrists, reli-
gious leaders, and literary critics beginning in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries (Campbell, 1949; Dourley, 1984, 1992;
Edinger, 1985; Hall & Sharp, 2008; Hannah, 1976; McLynn,
1996; Sharp, 2009; von Franz, 1980). Fuller has been com-
pared with other American authors as well as Transcendental-
ists from New England (Barrett & Cullinan, 1992; Cheever,
2007; Kunitz & Haycraft, 1938). Similarities and differences
between the beliefs and written works of Jung and Freud
have also been published. Others in the psychoanalytic tradi-
tion, such as Alfred Adler, have also been compared with
Jung (Frey-Rohn, 1974; Kerr, 1993; McGuire, 1974). In the
past, we have highlighted Jung's beliefs about play, unity,
and symbols related to Freidrich Froebel's writings (Russell
&Aldridge, 2009), and Jung's analytical psychology as com-
pared with Jean Piaget's constructivism (Aldridge, Eddowes,
Ewing, & Kuby, 1994). We have also addressed Jung's
contributions and applications of analytical psychology to
child development and education (Aldridge & Horns-Marsh,
1991). We have even considered what Jung borrowed from
Sabina Spielrein's work (Aldridge, 2009). However, no com-
parisons between Margaret Fuller's and Carl Jung's contri-
butions have been published.
The purpose of this article is to compare and contrast the
beliefs and written works of Fuller and Jung. We focus on
similarities and differences between their ideologies, espe-
cially their references to dreams, literature, spirituality, and
the feminine and masculine aspects of human development.
Special consideration is also given to how closely their writ-
ings actually intersect. Specifically, we explore whether Jung
was inspired by Fuller's writings or ideas? We begin by ask-
ing the question, "Who were Margaret Fuller and Carl Jung?"
Who Was Margaret Fuller?
Margaret Fuller (1810-1850) was a feminist, writer, editor,
and Transcendentalist (Taylor, 1971). Margaret Fuller believed
that every human deserved to reach full potential. To this end,
she created "conversations" for women, which she called
"feminine adventures" (Taylor, 1971, p. 13). This developed
into her most known writing titled Woman in the Nineteenth

Parallels in the Beliefs and Works
of Margaret Fuller and Carl Jung: Dreams,
Literature, Spirituality, and Gender

Abstract
Margaret Fuller, the 19th-century feminist and Transcendentalist, has been compared with Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau.The life and theories of Carl Jung, the 20th-century psychiatrist,
have been compared with the works of Sigmund Freud,Alfred Adler, Jean Piaget, and Sabina Spielrein among others. However,
no comparisons have been published concerning the beliefs and works of Fuller and Jung.The purpose of this research was
to compare and contrast the beliefs and written works of Margaret Fuller and Carl Jung. Similarities and differences were
reported among their ideologies. Similarities in their childhood and adult dreams, literary references, spiritual beliefs, and
explorations of gender were described. Differences were reported, which included the focus of their writings and their ideas
about who is to blame when things go wrong, and how to deal with the individual daemon in each person was also explored.
Special consideration was given to how closely their writings intersect. Specifically, the authors questioned whether Jung was
inspired by the ideas and writings of Fuller.To answer this question, five possibilities were identified.

Century (Fuller, 1845). The book inspired many events,
including the Seneca Falls Convention and feminist confer-
ences throughout the 1850s (Anthony, 1920). Furthermore,
Fuller's book was taught in women's colleges in the 1800s
and is still used as a seminal reference today in the history
of feminism (Capper, 2007). In fact, Woman in the Nineteenth
Century had a major impact on the life and works of Jane
Addams, the most well-known woman in American history
during the early 1900s (Knight, 2010). Fuller was also the
editor of The Dial, a Transcendentalist periodical. From
1846 to 1850, most of Fuller's time was spent in Italy as a
participant in the Garibaldi revolution (Anthony, 1920;
Taylor, 1971). While in Italy, Fuller became pregnant by a
man who was 10 years younger. After their marriage, Fuller,
her husband, baby, and her latest manuscript, written about
the revolution, were on their way back to the United States
when their ship hit a sandbar and they all drowned (Capper,
2007). During her short life, Margaret Fuller accomplished
many "firsts" for women. According to the Margaret Fuller
website, http://margaretfuller.org/, among her many accom-
plishments included
First woman to write a book about equality for women;
first editor of The Dial, foremost Transcendentalist
journal, appointed by Ralph Waldo Emerson; first
woman to enter Harvard Library to pursue research;
first journalist on Horace Greeley's New York Daily
Tribune; first woman literary critic who also set lit-
erary standards; and first woman foreign correspon-
dent and war correspondent to serve under combat
conditions. (p. 2)
For more comprehensive biographical information on
Margaret Fuller, we recommend Anthony (1920), Capper
(2007), Chevigny (1994), Mitchell (1995), Hymowitz and
Weissman (1978), Stern (1968), von Mehren (1994), and
Wade (1940).
Who Was Carl Jung?
Carl Jung (1875-1961), educated as a psychiatrist, was the
developer of analytical psychology. Analytical psychology
emphasizes the psychological need for spirituality as opposed
to a metaphysical conception of spirituality. This differs from
Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic focus on sexual develop-
ment and Alfred Adler's individual psychology related to
power issues. Jung's beliefs about the unconscious were dif-
ferent from other theorists. Besides the personal unconscious,
proposed by Freud, Jung posited and described the collective
unconscious, which is common to all (Jung, 1973). Jung (1989)
believed that dreams, active imagination, and symbolic activ-
ity were the road to the unconscious. Mythology and alchemy
were also salient to his ideas about human development and
the unconscious (von Franz, 2000). Another major contribu-
tion of Jung's was his explanation of the anima, the feminine
side of man, and the animus, the masculine counterpart of a
woman (Jung, 1973, 1989). For a thorough discussion of
Jung's life and works, we suggest the following sources:
Edinger (1984, 1985, 2002), Jung (1989), McLynn (1996),
Sharp (1987), and von Franz (1980, 1998, 2002).
Similarities Between Fuller and Jung
There are at least five similarities between Margaret Fuller
and Carl Jung's beliefs and writings. These include their
(a) nativist orientation, (b) beliefs in dreams and the uncon-
scious, (c) references to literature, (d) emphasis on spirituality,
and (e) ideas about gender. Each of these is presented here.
Nativism
Both Fuller and Jung were nativists. It is important to note that
nativists are different from empiricists and constructivists.
According to empiricists, knowledge comes from outside the
individual. The empiricist view is similar to the blank slate
model of development in which individuals are born without
knowledge. Knowledge is taught from the outside and moves
inward (Skinner, 1974). Constructivists are neither empiri-
cists nor nativists (Kamii, 2000). They believe humans have
the potential for constructing their own knowledge but knowl-
edge is not inherently present in the individual (Kamii, 2000;
Piaget, 1952). However, nativists believe that knowledge and
individual purpose are inborn (Hollis, 2005).
Both Fuller and Jung's writings emphasized a nativist
view of development. Fuller's works were rich with refer-
ences to nativism, although many of them were subtle. For
example, Fuller (1845) said, "The tree cannot come to flower
till its root be free from the cankering worm, and its whole
growth open to air and light" (p. 10). Less subtle was her
statement, "You would not learn through facts of thought or
action, but express through them the certainties of wisdom"
(p. 10). Finally she suggested, "As soon as the soul can
affirm clearly that a certain demonstration is wanted, it is at
hand" (p. 10).
Jung's (1973) manuscripts were also filled with references
to nativism, although he did not use the term nativism. Jung
(1966) said, "The meaning and purpose of the process is the
realization, in all its aspects, of the personality originally hid-
den away in the embryonic germ-plasm; the production and
unfolding of the original, potential wholeness" (p. 110). Late
in his life Jung reported, "Perhaps my unconscious is forming
a personality that is not me, but which is insisting on coming
through to expression" (Jung, 1989, p. 185). Often he sug-
gested that his work was driven from inside him. "I was com-
pelled from within, as it were, to formulate and express what
might have been said by Philemon" (Jung, 1989, p. 190).
Edward Edinger, a Jungian analyst, believed that the term
essentialist described Jung's life and works as readily as the
term nativist. He said Jung was an essentialist and not an
existentialist. Existentialists think they construct themselves.
Aldridge et al. 3
Essentialists believe they find themselves. They discover what
is inherently present within themselves (Edinger, 1984).
Dreams
Both Fuller and Jung were profoundly influenced by the vivid
dreams they experienced from childhood through adulthood
(Anthony, 1920; Jung, 1989). Anthony (1920) described in
detail the effect of early dreams on Margaret Fuller. "As a
woman of thirty, she still recalls the child's dreams with great
vividness" (p. 16). Certain themes were repeated in Margaret
Fuller's dreams. For example, "When at last she went to sleep,
it was to dream of horses trampling over her" (Anthony, 1920,
p. 18). Another dream was about trees dripping with blood.
The blood developed into a lake or pond and continued to
rise until it reached her head (Anthony, 1920). "Often she
dreamed of following to the grave the body of her mother, as
she had done that of her sister, and wake to find the pillow
drenched in tears" (Anthony, 1920, p. 17). By adulthood,
Margaret Fuller developed a personality from her dreams
she identified as "Leila" (Anthony, 1920). Fuller would turn
to Leila in the night:
At night I look into the lake for Leila. If I gaze steadily
and in the singleness of prayer, she rises and walks on
its depths. Then know I each night a part of her life;
I know where she passes the midnight hours. (Anthony,
1920, p. 53)
Fuller's dreams became more real to her than what hap-
pened to her in the external world (Wade, 1940).
Early in life, Jung also had a dream or vision that changed
his life from that point forward. Jung recalled,
I saw before me the cathedral, the blue sky. God sits on
His golden throne, high above the world--and from
under the throne an enormous turd falls upon the spar-
kling new roof, shatters it, and breaks the wall of the
cathedral asunder. (Jung, 1989, p. 39)
Analogous in some ways to Fuller's Leila, Jung devel-
oped what he called a No. 2 personality. Jung described the
interplay between his two personalities:
The play and counterplay between personalities No. 1
and No. 2, which has run through my whole life, has
nothing to do with a "split" or dissociation in the ordi-
nary medical sense. On the contrary, it is played out in
every individual. (Jung, 1989, p. 45)
Literary References
Numerous parallels can be found in Margaret Fuller's and
Carl Jung's literary references. They developed their ideolo-
gies using a wide body of literature including mythology, The
Bible, and more specifically, Goethe's writings and Kant's
works.
Fuller and Jung lectured and wrote extensively on the sym-
bolic in mythology. Fuller developed a set of seminars called
Conversations, "which she gave annually" (Brown, 1964,
p. 52). In her first seminar,
Margaret chose Greek mythology for her subject, using
the forms of Grecian myth and fable to express sym-
bolically the relations between the human constitu-
tion and nature. Thus Jupiter stood for Will; Mercury
for Understanding; Bacchus "the abandonment" of
Genius; Venus, instinctive womanhood; and Diana, chas-
tity. (Brown, 1964, p. 53)
Fuller also compared Greek and Egyptian mythology and
often referred to mythological symbolism in her conversa-
tions and writings (Chevigny, 1994). For Fuller,
What was a seed, or a root, merely, in the Egyptian
mind, became a flower in Greece,--Isis, and Osiris,
for instance, are reproduced in Ceres and Proserpine,
with some loss of generality, but with great gain of
beauty; Hermes, in Mercury, with only more grace of
form, though with great loss of grandeur; but the loss
of grandeur was also an advance in philosophy, in the
instance, the brain in the hand being the natural con-
sequence of the application of Idea to practice,--the
Hermes of the Egyptians. (Peabody, 1841, p. 348, cited
in Chevigny, 1994)
Jung also placed a strong emphasis on the symbolic in
mythology. Jung and Kerenyi (1963) believed "that mythol-
ogy is held to explain itself and everything else in the universe
not because it was invented for the purpose of explanation but
because it possesses among other things the property of being
explanatory" (pp. 4-5). Mythology is often the primary source
of explanation when science cannot provide an answer to our
most salient questions. "Mythology is not simply a mode of
expression in whose stead another simpler and more readily
understandable form might have been chosen, only not just
then, when it happened to be the only possible and appropri-
ate one" (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963, p. 3). From mythology, Jung
explored the archetypes of the collective unconscious and
described the universal nature of mythology. The divinities of
mythology "can best be understood as eternal forms, the great
world-realities" (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963, p. 103).
References to Biblical personalities, particularly as they
related to gender or archetypes, were used extensively in the
writings of Fuller (1845) and Jung (1969a). Fuller spoke with
disdain forAdam but with highest regard and reverence for the
Madonna. She wrote,
Adam accuses woman to his God, and records her dis-
grace to their posterity. He is not ashamed to write that
4 SAGE Open
he could be drawn from heaven by one beneath him,
one made, he says, from but a small part of himself.
(Fuller, 1845, p. 44)
But she said of the Virgin Mary, "No figure that has ever
arisen to greet our eyes has been received with more fervent
reverence than that of the Madonna" (p. 44).
Jung (1969b) also wrote a plethora of passages referring to
Biblical stories and images, explaining them in psychological
terms. He explored the paradox of the Garden of Eden where
God pointed out the tree of life, precipitating the fall of Adam
and Eve (Jung, 1969b). Jung further explored Job's relation-
ship with God in the "Answer to Job" (Jung, 1969b). He also
discussed the Virgin Mary and her independence from man.
Jung said,
Thus Mary, the virgin, is chosen as the pure vessel for
the coming birth of God. Her independence of the male
is emphasized by her virginity as the sine qua non of
the process. She is a "daughter of God" who, as a later
dogma will establish, is distinguished at the onset by
the privilege of an immaculate conception and is thus
free from the taint of original sin. (p. 398)
Goethe and Kant were Fuller's primary literary guides
(Brown, 1964). Fuller was so inspired by Goethe that she
translated many of his German writings into English (Fuller,
1839). "As she proceeded with her researches on Goethe,
she discovered more and more areas of which she knew
very little" (Brown, 1964, p. 27). Over time, "Goethe still
remained her chief literary guide" (p. 35). Fuller took several
ideas from Goethe and made them part of her philosophy.
Specifically, "Goethe and some of her early experiences
encouraged her to believe in fate and to attempt to probe
into its mysteries" (Brown, 1964, p. 67). She also believed,
like Goethe, that everyone has a daemon that must be
acknowledged. The daemon works through one's character
but cannot be contacted or analyzed. Furthermore, Goethe's
belief in self-culture "completely satisfied her" (p. 131).
"With Goethe, she held that character must be built from
within" (p. 131).
Jung also made numerous references to Goethe, particu-
larly to Faust (Jung, 1989). However, Jung's fascination
with Goethe and his writings extends further than just ideol-
ogy.According to a legend, Jung was a descendant of Goethe.
Jung explained, "The story goes that Sophie Ziegler had an
illegitimate child by Goethe, and that this child was my
grandfather, Carl Gustav Jung. This was considered virtually
an established fact" (Jung, 1989, p. 35). In his writings, Jung
continually referred to Faust and how it affected his soul.
Jung said of Faust,
It poured into my soul like a miraculous balm. Here at
last, I thought, is someone who takes the devil seriously
and even concludes a blood pact with him--with the
adversary who has the power to frustrate God's plan to
make a perfect world. (Jung, 1989, p. 60)
Perhaps the most profound statement Jung made about
Goethe also related to Faust. Speaking of his No. 2 personality,
Jung wrote,
For Goethe too, therefore--and this was my great
consolation--No. 2 was a reality. Faust as I now real-
ized with something of a shock, meant more to me
than my beloved Gospel according to St. John. There
was something in Faust that worked directly on my
feelings . . . The insight was not only comforting to
me, it also gave me an increased feeling of inner secu-
rity and a sense of belonging to the human community.
I was no longer isolated and a mere curiosity, a sport
of cruel nature. My godfather and authority was the
great Goethe himself. (Jung, 1989, p. 87)
Immanuel Kant was also referenced extensively by
both Fuller and Jung. Fuller's ideal of Transcendentalism
was inspired by Kant's (1781) Critique of Pure Reason.
"Transcendentalists were individualists to the core, fanatics
for freedom, brought together at intervals by the intellectual and
reflective temper of their minds and by a fondness for discus-
sion and analysis" (Wade, 1940, p. 57). Transcendentalists also
"believed in the power of intuition. They thought every man
and even some women harbored a divine spark . . . They called
this divine spark `reason.' Sometimes this was an inner light;
sometimes it was the voice of God" (Cheever, 2007, p. 11).
Carl Jung relied on Kant's (1788) Dreams of a Spirit Seer
to answer some of his questions on spiritualistic phenomena.
And, when Jung was deep in his medical studies, he still found
time to read Kant. Jung says, "I was able to study Kant only on
Sundays" (Jung, 1989, p, 101). Kant's writing put Jung "to
some hard thinking" (p. 70). Jung's fascination with Kant had
a lot to do with his interest in metaphysical experience. The
reading of Kant was able to challenge Jung's thinking, par-
ticularly as Kant's thinking related to Schopenhauer's work.
After reading Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781), Jung
believed he had found a major flaw in the Schopenhauer's
thinking. Jung reported,
Schopenhauer had committed the deadly sin of hypos-
tatizing a metaphysical assertion, and of endowing a
mere noumenon . . . with special qualities. I got this
from Kant's theory of knowledge, and it afforded me
an even greater illumination, if that were possible.
(Jung, 1989, p. 70)
Fuller and Jung's Emphasis on Spirituality
Spiritual development and the quest for wholeness were
integral parts of the lives and works of both Fuller and Jung
(Fuller, 1845; Jung, 1989). Their quests for spirituality led
Aldridge et al. 5
both of them through difficult times and doubt before each
developed their own specific notions about God and religion.
For Margaret Fuller, "the ideal truths of Christian experience
were what was important, not the religious institutions. The
religious instinct was where she centered her religious life"
(von Mehren, 1994, p. 150). von Mehren further commented
about Fuller's spiritual search that,
It was a tumultuous search, but she felt closest to reli-
gious fulfillment when she experienced a clear note of
security in her very soul. No prop will do. The soul
must do its own immortal work, and books, friends,
meditations fly from us only to return, when we can do
without them. (p. 151)
Margaret Fuller found her own way separate from a fixed,
organized religion. Brown (1964) explained Fuller's position
on organized religion. Margaret Fuller said,
I will not loathe sects, persuasions, systems, though
I cannot abide in them one moment, for I see that by
most men they are still needed . . . I would learn from
them all . . . But let me set no limits from the past, to
my own soul, or any soul. (Brown, 1964, p. 55, quoted
from "Credo" in Memoirs, II, 91)
Finally, for Margaret Fuller, "God was a constantly evolv-
ing `spirit uncontainable and uncontained'that kept all matter
evolving in a search for perfect forms. She believed that the
religious experience was a constant search for a closer per-
sonal relationship with God" (von Mehren, 1994, p. 150).
Fuller's lectures and writings on spirituality were also
influenced by her feminism. "Fuller herself refused to defer to
male theologians . . . Moreover, Fuller influenced the message
of many antebellum male religious leaders" (Lott, 2001, p. 3).
She did not "start a marginal religious movement. Instead, as
her contributions to the New York Tribune between 1844 and
1846 will demonstrate, Fuller worked to present her theol-
ogy or personal religion within the dominant culture without
being co-opted by it" (Lott, 2001, p. 3).
Carl Jung discussed spirituality from a psychological per-
spective. He described the psychological need for the God
image. Jung (1969b) explained, "To gain an understanding
of religious matters, probably all that is left us today is the
psychological approach" (p. 89). The history of the religion
of a culture is as telling of that culture as their government.
"Any religion which is rooted in the history of a people is as
much an expression of their psychology as the form of politi-
cal government, for instance, that the people have devel-
oped" (Jung, 1969b, p. 80).
Fuller and Jung's Ideas About Gender
Both Fuller and Jung had much to say about feminine and
masculine qualities. Fuller wrote extensively about social
feminist issues, gender differences, and her theory of gender
multiplicity (Fuller, 1845). Beyond her social feminist writ-
ings, Fuller believed that a woman had two distinct qualities
(von Mehren, 1994). She called these the muse and Minerva
qualities of women. Muse is the Great Goddess and is also
defined as the receptacle of the Holy Spirit (de Vries, 1984).
Minerva is the virgin goddess of wisdom and a favored
child of Zeus (Graves, 1996). The soul, to Fuller, was with-
out gender. However, when gender was added, the muse
quality emerged. "When a soul is `modified' as woman, it
flows, it breathes, it sings, rather than deposits soil or fin-
ishes work" (von Mehren, 1994, p. 168). "As a counter to the
weakening and painful effects of the overdevelopment of the
muse side of women, Fuller called for a greater emphasis on
the intellectual Minerva side to free women from becoming
victims of their overstimulated sensibilities" (von Mehren,
1994, p. 168).
Fuller also posited that there is no man that is totally mas-
culine and no female that is totally feminine. Speaking of what
women required, she suggested,
What a woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule but
as a nature to grow as an intellect to discern, as a soul to
live freely, and unimpeded to unfold such powers as
were given her when we left our common home. (von
Mehren, 1994, p. 168)
Thus, Fuller believed that a woman should have a bal-
ance between the muse and Minerva sides of her nature
(Fuller, 1845).
Although Fuller discussed the nature of gender in the 19th
century (Fuller, 1845), Jung explained the dilemma of gender
in the 20th century. Jung (1970) reported that woman "gives
expression to one of the cultural tendencies of our time: the
urge to live a completer life, a longing for meaning and fulfill-
ment, a growing disgust with senseless one-sidedness, with
unconscious instinctuality and blind contingency" (p. 130).
Jung equally discussed gender as it was affected by war.
"While man turns his hand to repairing the outer damage,
woman . . . sets about healing the inner wounds, and for this
she needs, as her most important instrument, a psychic rela-
tionship" (Jung, 1970, p. 132). Jung also found that "women
are far more `psychological' than men. A man is usually satis-
fied with `logic'alone" (p. 125).According to Jung, "woman's
psychology is founded on the principle of Eros, the great
binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling
principle ascribed to man is Logos" (Jung, 1970, p. 123).
Logos and Eros are posed as opposites and, since,
according to the law of Enantiodromia, over-dependence
on one principle constellates its opposite, the man
rigidly defensive of a Logos position is besieged by
the corresponding psychic principle activated in his
unconscious by images of anima. (Samuels, Shorter, &
Plaut, 1986, p. 87)
6 SAGE Open
Both Fuller and Jung spoke of Eros and Logos, although
they often used different terms to describe these qualities in
both male and female.
Although there are similarities in Fuller and Jung's discus-
sions of gender, Fuller appeared to have been more progres-
sive in her beliefs and writings about gender. For example,
Jung said,
If one lives out the opposite sex in oneself, one is liv-
ing in one's own background, and one's real individu-
ality suffers. A man should live as a man and a woman
as a woman. The contrasexual element in either sex, is
always dangerously close to the unconscious. (Jung,
1970, p. 118)
However, Jung's views on gender were enigmatic. Most
of Jung's followers were women and Jung collaborated
with women and encouraged many to become analysts
(McLynn, 1996).
Differences Between Fuller and Jung
Both Fuller and Jung were prolific writers. Fuller's publica-
tions were fewer, probably because she died at age 40 and
because she was a scholarly woman in a predominantly male
world. Jung lived to be 86 years old and his writings were
published in numerous volumes of his Collected Works
(1973). There were obviously many differences in the con-
tent and purpose in the publications of an American feminist
Transcendentalist of the 19th century and a Swiss psychia-
trist and theorist of the 20th century. This section deals with
just the major differences in the beliefs or ideologies between
Fuller and Jung. We believe the three most salient include
differences in focus (social justice vs. psychological develop-
ment), where responsibility for problems originates, and how
to deal with the daemon that resides in each human.
Social JusticeVersus Psychological
Development
Fuller and Jung included both sociological and psychological
issues in their writings. However, Fuller wrote more about
social justice pieces related to the context of women's lives
in the 19th century. The plight of women's opportunities and
social status were major themes in Fuller's Woman in the
Nineteenth Century (1845). Fuller (1845) described,
Those who think the physical circumstances of woman
would make a part in the affairs of national government
unsuitable, are by no means those who think it impos-
sible for the negressess to endure field work, even dur-
ing pregnancy, or the sempstresses to go through their
killing labors. (p. 24)
She worked and wrote for equality and justice for every
woman. "We would have every arbitrary barrier thrown down.
We would have every path laid open to woman as freely as
to man" (Fuller, 1845, p. 26). Much of Fuller's writings
were aimed at social justice--not only for women but also
for the people enslaved of her time and those without rights
(Wade, 1940).
Jung also wrote of social justice but believed that we make
the social world better through the psychological development
of each individual--that is, through the process of individua-
tion (Jung, 1964). von Franz, one of Jung's closest collabora-
tors said, "an unconditional devotion to one's own process of
individuation . . . brings about the best possible social adaption"
(von Franz, 1964, p. 241). The fate of humankind is dependent
on each person's individual work with his or her own psychol-
ogy and movement toward individuation. Jung compared the
human race with an individual's development. He said,
If . . . we regard mankind as one individual, we see that
the human race is like a person carried away by uncon-
scious powers; and the human race also likes to keep
certain problems tucked away in separate drawers. But
this is why we should give a great deal of consideration
to what we are doing, for mankind is now threatened by
self-created and deadly dangers that are growing beyond
our control. (Jung, 1964, p. 80)
Where Responsibility for Problems Originate
Arguably, Fuller (1845) was more likely to make men respon-
sible for problems in women's development and Jung (1954)
appeared quicker to place blame on the mother for her
children's problems. Fuller argued,
It may be said that man does not have his fair play
either; his energies are repressed and distorted by the
interposition of artificial obstacles. Ay, but he himself
has put them there; they have grown out of his own
imperfections. If there is a misfortune in woman's lot,
it is in obstacles being interposed by men, which do not
mark her state; and if they express her past ignorance
do not her present needs. (p. 37)
However, Jung (1954) said,
Whenever a young child exhibits the symptoms of a
neurosis one should not waste too much time examin-
ing his unconscious. One should begin one's investi-
gations elsewhere, starting with the mother; for almost
invariably the parents are either the direct cause of the
child's neurosis or at least the most important element
in it. (p. 69)
Analysis of the Daemon
Both Fuller and Jung believed, like Goethe, that everyone
has a daemon (Brown, 1964; Jung, 1989). The nature of that
daemon and what to do with it was discrepant in the writings
Aldridge et al. 7
of Fuller and Jung. As previously mentioned, Fuller believed
that the daemon works through one's character but cannot be
contacted or analyzed (Fuller, 1845). A daemon is more con-
temporarily compared with a soul's companion, or angel, or
fate (Hillman, 1996). However, Jung discovered ways to
approach the daemon through dream analysis and active
imagination (Jung, 1973). Jung also made references to
approaching the daemon. Jung referred to Eros as a daemon
(Jung, 1966). Still, Jung talked about how he would approach
the daemon. For example, Jung (1989) explained, referring
to Eros as a daemon that "I might, as many before me have
attempted to do, venture an approach to this daemon, whose
range or activity extends from the endless spaces of the heav-
ens to the dark abysses of hell" (p. 353). Plato too spoke about
each human soul choosing a particular destiny, a mythical,
complete, guarded essence of life formed within that is to be
found as if in an acorn, a personal daemon that dredges up
one's calling (Hillman, 1996).
According to Samuels et al. (1986), "Jung was well
aware of the reality of evil in human life" (p. 138). Jung also
described the shadow, which is the "negative side of the per-
sonality" (p. 183) or that which a person does not wish to be.
Fuller, who died 25 years before Jung was born, did not
refer to the shadow. However, her reference to the daemon
as a precursor to the term shadow will be discussed in the
next section.
Fuller's Ideas as a Precursor
to Many of Jung's Basic Concepts
Margaret Fuller accomplished much in the 40 years of her life,
inspiring numerous scholars from the mid-19th century into
the 21st century (Knight, 2010). In this section, we explore six
of Fuller's ideas that we believe were precursors to many of
Jung's basic tenets, including active imagination, typology,
the anima and animus, archetypes, the shadow, and the pro-
cess of individuation. So far in this article we have begun with
Margaret Fuller's beliefs and writings and compared them
with Carl Jung's. We now begin with Carl Jung's concepts and
definitions and attempt to demonstrate how Fuller's similar
ideas predated Jung's. We chose to present the information in
this order because many of the concepts, terms, and defini-
tions that Jung used were not available or defined during
Fuller's lifetime.
Active Imagination
Jung first described active imagination in relation to dreams
(Jung, 1935). Active imagination was defined as "a process
of dreaming with open eyes" (Samuels et al., 1986, p. 9).
Active imagination is not the same thing as daydreaming.
During daydreaming the fantasies are part of an individual's
conscious intent. However, in active imagination, uncon-
scious contents are active in a waking state. "Such fantasies
ask for the co-operation of conscious life" (Samuels et al.,
1986, p. 9). Barbara Hannah, who worked closely with Jung
and von Franz, circumambulated Jung's active imagination
and described how it can be used to confront the unconscious
(Hannah, 1981). "In every case, the goal is to get into touch
with the unconscious, and that entails giving it an opportunity
to express itself in some way or other" (Hannah, 1981, p. 17).
Sometimes a dream image will occur and active imagination
can be used in waking life to continue the dream work.
In our discussion of dreams, we described Fuller's encoun-
ter with a dream image she referred to as "Leila." Fuller
reported her dreams of Leila and (what Jung called) her active
imagination with Leila that followed. Fuller said of Leila,
In the day she lives among men; she observes their
deeds, and gives them what they want of her, justice or
love . . . In the night she wanders forth from her huan
investment, and travels amid these tribes, freer movers
in the game of spirit and matter, to whom this man is a
supplement. I know not then whether she is what men
call dreaming, but her life is true, full, and more single
than by day. (Anthony, 1920, pp. 53-54)
Fuller returned again and again to Leila because she
explained,
I find her always to have retreated into the secret veins
of earth. Then glows through her whole being the fire
that so baffles men, as she walks on the surface of the
earth; the blood-red, heart's-blood-red of the universal
heart, with no care except to circulate as the vital fluid;
and it would seem waste then for her to rise to the sur-
face. (Anthony, 1920, p. 54)
Fuller's interactions with Leila indicated that Leila's voice
came from the unconscious. Her communication with Leila
was in the form of active imagination and not from the con-
scious effort of daydreaming.
Typology
Jung was inspired to consider typology from his interactions
and observations of Freud and Adler. Jung (1989) reported,
"What with the sexual interpretation on the one hand and the
power drive of dogma on the other I was led, over the years,
to a consideration of the problem of typology" (p. 155). He
later explained,
I was busy with preparatory work for Psychological
Types . . . This work sprang originally from my need
to define the ways in which my outlook differed from
Freud's and Adler's. In attempting to answer this ques-
tion, I came across the problem of types. (Jung, 1989,
p. 207)
Jung continued by describing the basic attitudes of intro-
version and extraversion, which are the functions of con-
sciousness. There are feeling and thinking which influence
8 SAGE Open
how people make decisions. Simply put, some people make
decisions primarily from the head whereas others are more
likely to make decisions from the heart. There are also sens-
ing and intuition, which involve how people take in infor-
mation. Some people process the world through their senses
whereas others take in information from "inside their heads"
(Aldridge & Horns-Marsh, 1991).
Although Jung's exploration of typology was inspired by
the differences he noticed among himself, Freud, and Adler,
Fuller's discovery of typology began with her investigation
of her own feminine nature and that of other women. In the
previous section titled "Fuller and Jung's Ideas about Gender,"
we presented Fuller's description of the muse and Minerva
qualities of women. However, we did not explain that these
qualities also refer to typology. The muse quality is analogous
to Jung's conception of the feeling function, whereas Minerva
is a metaphor for the thinking function. In other words,
Fuller discovered the feeling and thinking functions before
Jung (von Mehren, 1994).
Anima/Animus
Samuels et al. (1986) described the anima as "the inner figure
of woman held by a man" and the animus as "the figure of
man at work in a woman's psyche" (p. 23). Men may easily
recognize the anima in literature or in film but not in them-
selves. Also, women may want to be equal with men but
remain true to their femininity precipitating conflict with the
animus within. "Possession by either anima or animus trans-
forms the personality in such a way as to give prominence to
those traits which are seen as psychologically characteristic
of the opposite sex" (Samuels et al., 1986, p. 24).
von Franz (1964) explained as follows:
A particularly good example of how the anima is expe-
rienced as an inner figure in a man's psyche is found in
the medicine men and prophets (shamans) among the
Eskimo and other arctic tribes. Some of these even wear
women's clothes or have breasts depicted on their gar-
ments, in order to manifest their inner feminine side--
the side that enables them to connect with the "ghost
land" (i.e., what we call the unconscious. (p. 186)
von Franz continued to explain that
Just as the character of a man's anima is shaped by
his mother, so the animus is basically influenced by
a woman's father. The father endows his daughter's
animus with the special coloring or unarguable, incon-
testably "true" convictions--convictions that never
include the personality of the woman herself as she
actually is. (p. 199)
Fuller's theory of gender multiplicity can be seen as a
forerunner of Jung's discovery of the anima and animus.
Fuller, less specifically than Jung, described the feminine and
masculine as being present in every woman and man (von
Mehren, 1994). Fuller explained the conflict within herself
regarding the feminine and masculine. She lamented,
My history presents much superficial, temporary trag-
edy. The woman in me kneels and weeps in tender
rapture; the man rushes forth, but only to be baffled.
Yet the time will come, when, from the union of this
tragic king and queen, shall be born a radiant sovereign
self. (von Mehren, 1994, p. 185)
Although Fuller did not use the terms anima or animus,
her writings were full of metaphors that referred to one or
the other. She referred to the anima when she said of the
poet, "we may yet conceive that it was the image of a queen
before the poet's mind that called up this splendid court of
women" (Fuller, 1845, p. 54). She even analogously described
the negative anima in men and the negative animus in
women when she exclaimed, "to men, the woman seems
an unlovely siren; to women, the man an effeminate boy"
(Fuller, 1845, p. 60).
Archetypes
According to Jung (1969a), "The term `archetype' occurs as
early as Philo Judaeus, with reference to the Imago Dei (God
image) in man" (p. 4). An archetype "is the inherited part of
the psyche; structuring patterns of psychological performance
linked to instinct; a hypothetical entity irrepresentable in itself
and evident only through its manifestations" (Samuels et al.,
1986, p. 26). There are virtually hundreds of archetypes which
include the witch, queen, king, jester, orphan, and sage. Primitive
tribal lore, mythology, and fairy tales are all expressions of the
archetypes (Jung, 1969a). The structures are the same but
the contents are individual.
Fuller did not use the term archetypes but her ideas and
writings were full of archetypal images. In fact, in Woman
in the Nineteenth Century, Fuller (1845) included multiple
appendices, which are rich with archetypal material, espe-
cially literary references. Fuller also referred to the queen,
king, and sage as represented in human behavior and relation-
ships (Fuller, 1845). And, in her writings on art and litera-
ture, she discussed archetypal images, but did not use the
term archetypes in her descriptions (Fuller, 1846).
The Shadow
Jung described the shadow as that which a person does not
want to be (Jung, 1969a). The shadow is "the sum of all the
unpleasant qualities one wants to hide, the inferior, the
worthless and primitive side of man's nature" (Samuels et al.,
1986, p. 138). Our projections are how we come to find out
about the shadow. Jung gave the example of the woman
who thought all of her friends were inferior and caused her
problems, not realizing it was her attitude that caused the
problems.
Aldridge et al. 9
Fuller's beliefs and writings about the daemon predated
Jung's description of the shadow (Brown, 1964; Fuller, 1845).
Although Fuller's description of the daemon was not identical
to Jung's explanation of the shadow, they can be taken as anal-
ogous.As we have already conveyed, Fuller thought everyone
had a daemon but the daemon could not be contacted directly
or analyzed (1845). According to Jung, the personal shadow
can be brought to consciousness but is exceptionally resistant.
The shadow is one of the most challenging entities for an ana-
lyst or analysand.
Individuation
According to Samuels et al. (1986), individuation "is the key
concept in Jung's contribution to the theories of personality
development" (p. 76). Simply put, individuation is the pro-
cess of a person becoming who she was created to be. It is a
person's quest for wholeness that is unique to each individual
but must always be experienced in relation to the world and
to other people (Jung, 1969b). According to Jung, "individu-
ation does not shut out from the world, but gathers the world
to oneself" (Samuels et al., 1986, p. 77). However, individu-
ation is not egocentric or selfish. It is true that a person may
have to leave the tribe to become individuated but through
the process the individual must bring something useful back
to society.
Again, Fuller's beliefs and writings were about individu-
ation. True again, she did not use the term individuation but
Fuller believed every person should become all she could be.
Fuller's writings emphasized individuation in women and
people enslaved during the antebellum times in which she
lived (Fuller, 1845). She also explicitly described the imped-
iments to individuation a woman faced based on culture,
religion, and society. She explained,
The severe nation which taught that the happiness of
the race was forfeited through the fault of a woman,
and showed its thought of what sort of regard man
owed her, by making him accuse her on the first
question to his God; who gave her the patriarch as a
handmaid, and by the Mosaical law, bound her to
allegiance like a serf; even they greeted, with solemn
rapture, all great and holy women as heroines, proph-
etesses, judges in Israel; and if they made Eve listen to
the serpent, gave Mary as a bride to the Holy Spirit.
(Fuller, 1845, p. 35)
More salient than Fuller's beliefs and writings about what
Jung later referred to as individuation, was Fuller's personal
example of the individuation process (Anthony, 1920). Fuller
remains one of the greatest exemplars of individuation in the
19th century. She left the "tribe" but through her own strug-
gles brought something back to society. In this article, we
have reviewed some of the contributions Margaret Fuller made
to the world. Probably more important, though, was who she
became. Her beliefs and writings have inspired feminists,
social activists, intellectuals, educators, psychologists, and
critical theorists of today (Capper, 2007; Christensen, 2010;
Knight, 2010).
Was Jung Inspired by Fuller?
Was Carl Jung influenced by the beliefs and writings of
Margaret Fuller and, if so, how did this occur? There are five
possible answers to this question. First, Jung could have
directly copied or plagiarized Fuller's works. We found no
evidence of this in our research. However, Jung's ideas were
so closely aligned to many of Fuller's beliefs that we had to
consider this as a possibility. Jung and Fuller were both flu-
ent in German and English and it is possible that Jung read
Fuller's writings in either language. Both must have read
Plato's work.
A second possibility is unintentional plagiarism. We con-
sider this possibility because Jung suggested this as a possi-
bility that can occur when a person is writing (Jung, 1964).
Jung reported that a writer can actually plagiarize without an
awareness of it. He said, "it can sometimes be shown con-
vincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity
to the work of another author--a work that he believes he has
never seen" (p. 23). Jung explained in detail an example that
involved Nietzsche. He said,
I myself found a fascinating example of this in
Nietzsche's book Thus Spake Zarathustra, where the
author reproduces almost word for word an incident
reported in a ship's log for the year 1686. By sheer
chance I had read this seaman's yarn in a book pub-
lished about 1835 (half a century before Nietzsche
wrote); and when I found the similar passage in Thus
Spake Zarathustra, I was struck by its peculiar style,
which was different from Nietzsche's usual language.
I was convinced that Nietzsche must also have seen
the old book, though he made no reference to it. (Jung,
1964, p. 24)
We do not know whether Jung actually read Fuller's texts
but do propose the possibility that he at one time came across
her works and may have remembered some of her ideas.
A third possibility is that Fuller and Jung were both influ-
enced by archetypal ideas. Archetypes appear in all literature
and both of them were inspired by forces greater than their
own personal experiences. Ideas that were similar between
Fuller and Jung could be attributed to universals that have
appeared in literature throughout history.After all, Fuller and
Jung made connections between their ideas about dreams,
spirituality and gender with mythology, The Bible, and con-
temporary thinkers and writers of their day.
A fourth idea, related to the third, has to do with the 100th
monkey phenomenon (Blair, 1975; Myers, 1985). According
to Blair (1975), Japanese monkeys, Macaca Fuscata, were
10 SAGE Open
being studied. The monkeys enjoyed the taste of sweet pota-
toes that scientists left for them. A young female called Imo
found that washing them made them taste better. She taught
this behavior to her mom and other monkeys. Then, one day
monkeys everywhere began to wash sweet potatoes before
eating them. The theory of the 100th monkey is that when a
certain number of a species, let's say 100, are able to do
something then it becomes a part of that species' behavior,
a critical consciousness. Related to Fuller and Jung, their
ideas and beliefs could have been influenced by the num-
bers of individuals who were contemplating and thinking
many of the same things. In fact, Myers (1985) described
the 100th monkey story in relation to one of Jung's major
conceptions--the collective unconscious.
Finally, some may believe that there are few connections
between Margaret Fuller's and Carl Jung's beliefs and writ-
ings. After all, many of their ideas are similar to other schol-
ars' beliefs and their writings have been compared with a
plethora of other works. Still, we find the beliefs and works
of Fuller and Jung to be remarkably similar even if their lives
and times were considerably different.
Conclusions
Many of Jung's analytical psychology tenets were similar
to Fuller's beliefs and writings. Although both have been
compared with others, we found no published works that
compared Carl Jung with Margaret Fuller. We have com-
pared and contrasted the beliefs and written works of
Fuller and Jung. Similarities included dreams, literature,
spirituality, and their interests in gender. Differences were
found in their writings as well. Fuller's texts appeared to be
focused on social justice, whereas Jung's sources addressed
social issues but from a psychological perspective. When it
comes to who should take responsibility for problems that
arise, it is not surprising to note that Fuller believed the
man was to blame whereas Jung tended to consider the
woman to be a source of the troubles. It is interesting to
wonder about the anima and animus in practice in both of
their writings. Although they both agreed that all humans
have a daemon, Fuller and Jung had different ideas on how
to deal with it.
ManyofFuller'sbeliefspredatedJung'sideas.Specifically,
Fuller described active imagination, typology, aspects of
the anima and animus, the shadow, archetypes, and the
individuation process, although she did not use these terms.
Finally, we have questioned whether Jung was familiar
with Fuller's writings and how much of his theories can
be attributed to her influence. Clearly, more investigation
between the beliefs and writings of Margaret Fuller and
Carl Jung needs to occur. We anticipate further amplifica-
tion and debate on the beliefs and published works of Fuller
and Jung.
