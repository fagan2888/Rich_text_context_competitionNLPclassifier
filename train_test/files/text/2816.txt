Abstract
This paper examines the international credit portfolios of German banks. We con-
struct a bank-country panel from a unique dataset for a representative set of countries
and ask why banks leave diversification opportunities unexploited in some countries.
Controlling for bank heterogeneity, we analyse the deviations of actual portfolios from
a mean-variance based benchmark and their country-level determinants. Our results
show that banking regulations are important determinants of the credit allocation of
German banks. We present robust evidence that countries with stricter capital ade-
quacy and entry requirements tend to be overweighted, primarily due to excess profits
resulting from a lower level of banking market competition. German banks also over-
weight countries with larger and more developed banking markets. Moreover, we find
support that German banks follow their domestic customers abroad to maintain ex-
isting lending relationships. Geographical factors, in contrast, do not seem to matter.
Our findings suggest that changes in and convergence of banking regulations as well as
financial deepening of banking sectors around the world may, in the long term, result
in banks holding more diversified international credit portfolios.

Non-technical summary
The global financial crisis and the ongoing debt crisis have highlighted the role of large, glob-
ally oriented banks and their importance in studying international financial integration. Over
the past two decades, major German banks, like other banks around the globe, have increased
their international exposure through both cross-border lending and by the establishment of
branches and subsidiaries abroad. Therefore, internationally oriented German banks nowa-
days rely heavily on the development of their foreign claims. However, even though the
expansion into foreign markets creates opportunities for banks to better diversify their credit
portfolios by exploiting the less-than-perfect co-movement of international business cycles,
German banks continue to focus strongly on developed countries in their portfolios.
In this paper, we investigate which country-specific determinants lead German banks
to overweight some countries and underweight others in their international credit portfolios
against a mean-variance based benchmark. We ask which geographical, institutional, and
regulatory frictions cause German banks to leave opportunities for diversification unexploited.
To this end, we construct from the Deutsche Bundesbank's External Position Reports of
German Banks a bank-country panel for the years 2003 to 2007 for large, internationally
oriented German banks and a representative set of 35 countries from all regions of the world
which comprehensively reflects the investment opportunity set of German banks.
Our results show that banking regulations are important determinants of German banks'
international credit portfolios. Countries with stricter capital adequacy and entry require-
ments tend to be overweighted, primarily due to a lower level of banking market competition.
German banks also overweight countries with larger and more developed banking markets,
and tend to follow their domestic clients abroad in order to maintain existing lending rela-
tionships. Geographical factors, in contrast, do not seem to matter. German banks' credit
portfolios do not appear to be determined by country factors which cannot change over time.
Instead, there is reason to believe that changes in and convergence of banking regulations
and deepening of banking sectors around the world may result in banks holding more diversi-
fied international credit portfolios, making them more stable and resilient to country-specific
shocks.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Die globale Finanz- und die noch andauernde Schuldenkrise haben die Rolle großer, global
ausgerichteter Banken sowie deren Bedeutung für das Verständnis internationaler Finanzin-
tegration verdeutlicht. In den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten haben große deutsche Banken, wie
andere globale Banken auch, ihr internationales Engagement sowohl durch eine Steigerung
der grenzüberschreitenden Kreditvergabe als auch durch den Aufbau von Töchtern und Fil-
ialen im Ausland erhöht. International ausgerichtete deutsche Banken sind daher heute
stark von der Entwicklung ihrer Auslandsforderungen abhängig. Während die Erschließung
neuer Auslandsmärkte Banken grundsätzlich bessere Diversifikationsmöglichkeiten durch das
Ausnutzen nicht perfekt synchron verlaufender Konjunkturzyklen ermöglicht, konzentrieren
deutsche Banken ihre Portefeuilles dennoch weiterhin stark auf entwickelte Länder.
Das vorliegende Papier untersucht daher, welche länderspezifischen Determinanten deut-
sche Banken dazu veranlassen, gegenüber einem auf dem Mittelwert-Varianz-Ansatz basieren-
den Benchmarkportefeuille manche Länder in ihren internationalen Kreditportefeuilles über-
und andere unterzugewichten. Insbesondere fragen wir, welche geografischen, institutionellen
und regulatorischen Friktionen das von deutschen Banken ungenutzte Diversifikationspoten-
zial erklären. Dafür nutzen wir auf Grundlage des Auslandsstatus der deutschen Banken ein
Bank-Land-Panel für die Jahre 2003 bis 2007 für große, international ausgerichtete deutsche
Banken und eine repräsentative Stichprobe von 35 Ländern, die alle Regionen der Welt und
damit die Investitionsmöglichkeiten deutscher Banken breit abbildet.
Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Bankregulierungen bedeutende Determinanten der inter-
nationalen Kreditportefeuilles deutscher Banken sind. Länder mit strengeren Kapital- und
Markteintrittsanforderungen werden tendenziell übergewichtet, und zwar in erster Linie auf-
grund geringeren Wettbewerbs im jeweiligen Bankenmarkt. Des Weiteren übergewichten
deutsche Banken Länder mit größeren, entwickelteren Bankenmärkten und neigen dazu, ihren
heimischen Kunden zwecks Sicherung bestehender Kreditbeziehungen ins Ausland zu folgen.
Geografische Faktoren scheinen hingegen keine Rolle zu spielen. Von der Warte interna-
tionaler Finanzintegration und -stabilität aus betrachtet implizieren diese Ergebnisse, dass die
Kreditportefeuilles deutscher Banken nicht durch unveränderbare länderspezifische Faktoren
bestimmt sind. Es besteht im Gegenteil Grund zu der Annahme, dass langfristig Änderun-
gen und Konvergenz von Bankregulierungen sowie eine weitere Vertiefung der Bankenmärkte
der Welt zu diversifizierteren internationalen Kreditportefeuilles führen und somit Banken
stabiler und robuster gegenüber länderspezifischen Schocks machen könnten.

Diversification and Determinants of International
Credit Portfolios: Evidence from German Banks
1 Introduction
The global financial crisis and the ongoing debt crisis have brought to centre stage the
activities of large, globally oriented banks and their importance in studying international
financial integration. In fact, when the first signs of financial turmoil began to show in 2007,
the foreign claims of banks reporting to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) stood
at $34 trn at the end of the year as compared to only $11 trn in 2000, and just $1 trn in
1990. Banks from Germany have likewise increased their international exposure through
both cross-border lending and the establishment of branches and subsidiaries abroad. BIS
data also reveal that Germany has been one of the top source countries of worldwide foreign
claims for the past two decades. Moreover, at the end of 2007, foreign activities were already
more important than domestic activities for major German banks, making up between 50
and 70% of their total assets. Therefore, internationally oriented German banks nowadays
rely heavily on the development of their foreign claims.
This implies that internationally active banks should decide on new business with the
risk and return of their foreign portfolios in mind. At the same time, the expansion into
foreign markets creates the potential for banks to diversify across countries by exploiting the
less-than-perfect co-movement of business cycles around the world. For instance, Kose et al.
(2008) point out that notable business cycle asynchronicity between industrial countries on
the one hand, and emerging market economies and developing countries on the other, con-
tinues to exist to this day. However, banking flows are primarily concentrated on developed
markets (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille 2011). Large, globally oriented German banks also focus
strongly on developed countries in their portfolios.
In this paper, we investigate which country-specific determinants lead German banks
to overweight some countries and underweight others in their international credit portfolios

against a mean-variance based benchmark. More specifically, we ask which geographical,
institutional, and regulatory frictions cause German banks to leave opportunities for diversi-
fication unexploited. Our results show that banking regulations are important determinants
of the international credit portfolios of German banks. We present robust evidence that
countries with stricter capital adequacy and entry requirements tend to be overweighted,
primarily due to a lower level of banking market competition. German banks also overweight
countries with larger and more developed banking markets. Furthermore, we find that Ger-
man banks tend to follow their domestic customers abroad in order to maintain existing
lending relationships. Geographical factors, in contrast, do not seem to matter.
Our results are based on the Deutsche Bundesbank's External Position Reports of German
Banks. This unique dataset contains micro-level data on the foreign exposure of all German
banks, including their branches and subsidiaries abroad. From this dataset we construct a
bank-country panel for the period between 2003 and 2007 for large, internationally oriented
German banks and a representative set of 35 countries from all regions of the world that
comprehensively reflects the investment opportunity set of German banks.
We compare the actual international credit portfolios of the banks in our sample to bench-
mark portfolios we would expect to observe in the absence of country-specific frictions. The
benchmark portfolios are derived using a mean-variance approach à la Markowitz (1952,
1959). This is similar to García-Herrero and Vázquez (2007) and Buch et al. (2010). The
latter use an unpublished aggregate, locational BIS dataset on the cross-border assets1 of
banks from France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 23 coun-
tries around the world to identify barriers to international diversification. They estimate
probit models and find that the probability of a country's being overweighted decreases with
the severity of capital controls, and increases with a survey measure of trust among residents
in the destination country. A major drawback of their study is that they concentrate on
cross-border exposure only. However, large global banks have significantly increased their
lending through foreign affiliates over the past two decades. The average bank in our sample,
for instance, relies on branches and subsidiaries for about 40 to 50% of its foreign credit
exposure. Moreover, solely focusing on cross-border lending might give a distorted view due
to potential substitution effects because some loans that used to be extended cross-border
may be granted locally once an affiliate has been set up (García-Herrero and Martínez Pería
2007). Our dataset, in contrast, allows us to consider the consolidated foreign exposure of
individual banks and, crucially, to account for heterogeneity in banks' international portfolio
strategies.
1We focus more precisely on the credit portfolios of banks rather than their entire asset portfolios.
2
García-Herrero and Vázquez (2007) compile a bank-level dataset of international banks
from eight major industrial countries to quantify the potential gains from international diver-
sification. They find that international banks which allocate a larger share of their assets to
foreign subsidiaries are able to achieve higher risk-adjusted returns, particularly in emerging
markets. Banks' actual international asset portfolios are found to leave these opportunities
largely unexploited in comparison to the results from a mean-variance optimisation. How-
ever, their results should be taken with caution, too, as they cannot account for parent bank
and branch lending. Furthermore, the authors do not have information on ultimate lending
destinations and, hence, implicitly assume that claims by foreign subsidiaries are exclusively
against counterparties in the country of location. Our dataset does not suffer from these
shortcomings since we are able to identify actual destination countries for the parent bank,
its foreign branches, and its foreign subsidiaries.
This paper also relates to empirical research on the determinants of the stocks and flows
of international assets. Based on augmented gravity regressions, a number of studies inves-
tigate the importance of distance in explaining international financial flows. Whereas Portes
et al. (2001) and Portes and Rey (2005) find that distance, proxying information costs,
still massively impedes cross-border flows of equities and bonds, the evidence in Aviat and
Coeurdacier (2007) is that the effect of distance on bilateral bank asset holdings is massively
reduced once goods trade is accounted for. The issue does not appear to be settled, though.
For instance, Heuchemer et al. (2009) detect significant distance and border effects using an
aggregated bilateral dataset of European cross-border loans.
We consistently find that more distant countries are not systematically underweighted.
This is a strong result because we are able to isolate the hypothesis that distance constitutes
a barrier in international lending via informational asymmetries from the conjecture that it
might have a positive effect on portfolio holdings through diversification opportunities, which
tend to increase with distance (eg, Portes et al. 2001). Since diversification opportunities are
accounted for in the benchmark portfolios against which we evaluate actual international
credit portfolios, the evidence in this paper suggests that informational asymmetries do not
monotonically increase with distance to the destination country. This is in line with Buch
et al. (2010) who do not find an effect of distance on the probability of a country's being
overweighted either.
However, we find strong evidence that banking regulations affect the over- or under-
weighting of countries in German banks' international credit portfolios. More specifically,
German banks are particularly attracted to countries with higher entry and capital adequacy
requirements. We show that this is due to lower levels of competition and efficiency in these
3
countries. As a consequence, German banks might be able to generate excess returns through
superior management skills and technologies needed to run international operations.
Competition among banks for domestic customers also seems to be an important factor
in the composition of international credit portfolios. German banks' international lending
appears strongly driven by the desire to maintain existing relationships with domestic client
firms when those venture abroad and set up operations in a foreign country. This follow-your-
customer motive has been established by several studies (see, eg, Goldberg and Saunders 1980,
1981, Brealey and Kaplanis 1996, Yamori 1998) and also seems to affect the international
lending decisions of German banks.
Moreover, German banks tend to overweight countries with deeper, more developed bank-
ing markets which might offer better opportunities for diversification. The level of risk-taking
in the banking sector of the host country appears to matter as well. We observe that the
banks in our sample increased their lending to countries with riskier banking sectors. This
may have happened either deliberately to raise profits or ignorantly due to a failure of risk
management systems that reduced risk perception.
The credit portfolios of German banks do not seem to be determined by country factors
which cannot change over time. Instead, there is reason to believe that, in the long run,
changes in and convergence of banking regulations as well as financial deepening of banking
sectors around the world will result in banks holding more diversified international credit
portfolios. A structural change in the portfolio composition of German banks may already
have set in. While their exposure to developed countries contracted by roughly 30% between
2007 and 2010, lending to developing countries went up by about 20%. Similarly, the broad
picture is that cross-border bank flows to developed countries in general, and the United
States and Europe in particular, contracted to a significantly larger extent during the financial
crisis than to emerging and developing countries (Milesi-Ferretti and Tille 2011). This process
is desirable from the point of view of financial stability because it should reduce the deviations
from our benchmark portfolios and leave banks with portfolios that make them more stable
and resilient to country-specific shocks.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset and characterises the
actual international credit portfolios of German banks. The methodology and properties of
the benchmark portfolios are outlined in Section 3, while the frictions of interest and the
empirical strategy to identify them are discussed in Section 4. The estimation results are
presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.

2 International credit portfolios of German banks
2.1 Dataset
Data on international credit portfolios are from the Deutsche Bundesbank's External Po-
sition Reports of German Banks. This dataset contains monthly micro-level data on the
external assets and liabilities of German banks, including their branches and subsidiaries
abroad. Moreover, foreign assets and liabilities are broken down along a number of different
dimensions such as destination country, asset class, counterparty sector, currency denomina-
tion, and maturity.2 The richness of the dataset makes it highly suitable for investigating
the international diversification of bank credit portfolios. Three advantages stand out in
particular.
First, data are available at the bank level. While we are interested in the country-
specific frictions due to which banks' portfolios deviate from optimally diversified benchmark
portfolios, individual banks might differ in their country exposures for reasons other than the
factors we are able to observe. For instance, banks may have a lot of experience and expertise
in a certain market or other competitive advantages. There may also be banks which single
out certain strategically important countries in their international portfolio strategy. The
bank-country dimension of our dataset allows us to control for such unobserved heterogeneity
in our econometric analysis (see 4.1). This is a significant improvement over the dataset used
by Buch et al. (2010).
Second, reporting is not confined to the external positions of bank headquarters but
instead includes those of foreign affiliates as well. This is important since banks have not
only increased their cross-border exposures over the past two decades but also their lending
via branches and subsidiaries (see, eg, Clarke et al. 2003).3 A glance at the data reveals the
importance of foreign affiliates for internationally oriented banks. The average bank in our
sample relies on branches and subsidiaries for about 40 to 50% of its foreign exposure, with
percentages even ranging into the 90s as banks become larger and more internationally active.
Moreover, there is reason to suspect substitution effects in international lending between the
bank headquarters and their foreign affiliates. Some loans which used to be extended by
the parent bank may be granted locally once a foreign affiliate has been set up.4 Hence,
focusing only on either cross-border or affiliate lending would give a biased picture of banks'
international diversification and its determinants. In contrast to García-Herrero and Vázquez
2For a more detailed documentation, see Fiorentino et al. (2010).
3Cross-border lending refers to lending conducted directly by the parent bank, ie from a banking group's
headquarters, rather than by its foreign affiliates. We will therefore use these terms interchangeably. Likewise,
we will also occasionally refer to lending via foreign affiliates as local lending.
4Also see García-Herrero and Martínez Pería (2007) who investigate the mix of international banks' foreign
claims between cross-border and local affiliate lending.
5
(2007) and Buch et al. (2010), our dataset makes it possible to analyse a bank's consolidated
foreign exposure by summing cross-border and affiliate lending.5
Finally, foreign exposures are reported for the actual country of destination. This is
another improvement with respect to other datasets that contain no information on lending
destinations such as the one used by García-Herrero and Vázquez (2007). Their implicit
assumption that claims by foreign subsidiaries are exclusively against counterparties in the
country of location may be appropriate in most instances. However, international banks
also use financial centres as "hubs" in order to lend to foreign clients outside those centres.
Therefore, our data can be seen as providing a further refinement in that regard.
2.2 Sample selection
We use the detailed information on foreign claims to focus our analysis along a number of
dimensions and to construct a dataset best suited to addressing our research question.
First, we focus on a specific set of banks. The key question of the paper is why banks
which can be assumed to diversify internationally overweight some countries whilst under-
weighting others. We therefore require that the banks in our sample be sufficiently large
and internationally oriented. For Germany, we identify those banks as the major commercial
banks and the head institutions of the savings and co-operative banks. We exclude individ-
ual savings and co-operative banks as well as small or mid-sized banks due to their focus
on domestic activities. Specialised lenders are not included either since they pursue distinct
business models (eg, mortgage lending, business development loans, car financing).
Our final bank sample consists of 18 institutions. Compared to all other German banks,
the banks in our sample have a considerably larger exposure to foreign countries. For example,
while the banks in our sample have a significant credit exposure in roughly 50 countries, the
average number of countries to which all other German banks have substantial exposure is
close to zero. The banks in our sample also have significantly more foreign affiliates than
the other banks. Whereas the former have, on average, a branch and/or subsidiary in about
ten countries, the latter only have a local presence in approximately three foreign countries.
Overall, the banks in our sample are sufficiently large and internationally oriented to pursue
an international diversification strategy.
Second, we constrain our investigation to the period between 2003 and 2007. We exclude
the global financial and debt crisis years since our research question appears most reasonable
5Whereas García-Herrero and Vázquez (2007) rely entirely on foreign subsidiaries data from Bankscope,
Buch et al. (2010) cannot include subsidiaries as part of a banking group since their data are locational. In
our dataset, the foreign subsidiaries of large, internationally active banks often account for as much as 20 to
30% of consolidated foreign exposure.
6
in "normal" times, ie relative tranquillity in financial markets. In times of financial distress,
however, we would expect short-term motives (eg, loss reduction) to dominate strategic
considerations by banks, such as the international diversification of credit portfolios.6
Third, we focus on loans to the non-bank private sector.7 Table 1 shows that this lend-
ing aggregate is the most important component of German banks' total foreign claims over
the entire sample period (42% in 2007). Holdings of foreign bonds and commercial paper
(33%) and credit to foreign banks (18%) are less important. We do not include bonds and
commercial paper since we cannot be sure that this asset category does not capture securi-
tised assets. This might be problematic due to the fact that securitisation was particularly
prevalent during our sample period in the run-up to the global financial crisis and driven by
different considerations. Likewise, we exclude credit to foreign banks which is predominantly
short-term in nature and not driven by long-term portfolio considerations. Foreign equity
(5%) is unimportant with regard to the international exposure of German banks.

Finally, despite constraints on the availability of equity indices, which are the basis for
the calculation of benchmark portfolios (see 3.1), we are able to construct a dataset that
includes a representative sample of 35 countries covering all major regions of the world (see
Table A.1). This set of countries covers about 85% of the total foreign non-bank credit by the
banks in our sample. By capturing a substantial amount of cross-country heterogeneity and

potential diversification opportunities, we can expect to gain insights into the country-specific
determinants of German banks' international credit portfolios.
We consolidate the loans to the non-bank private sector for all 18 banking groups over the
sample period by summing the exposures of the parent bank and all of its foreign affiliates.
That is, we assume that German parent banks do not only consider their foreign branches as
part of their international strategies, but also their foreign subsidiaries. This is reasonable
due to the tendency of international banks to incorporate branches and subsidiaries in their
international strategy and the special importance of internal capital markets for German
banks. McCauley et al. (2010), for example, show that the foreign affiliates of German banks
in particular depend more heavily on internal capital markets for funding than those of other
international banking groups. This suggests that the foreign affiliates of German banks are
particularly integrated with their parent. We therefore include them in the analysis.
2.3 Stylised facts
Figure 1 shows the development of credit to the foreign non-bank private sector between
2003 and 2007 for both the total foreign exposure of all German banks (circa 2,000) and that
of the 18 sample banks to the representative set of 35 countries. In each case, there is a

from e 617 bn to e 865 bn. Both aggregates also move remarkably in tandem, indicating

that our sample is highly comprehensive and representative along both the bank and country
dimensions. Overall, our sample consistently accounts for 70% or more of all foreign credit
by the entire German banking system. We will refer to this sample here and in the following.

The United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) are by far the most important

40% and the UK for roughly a third of total lending of lending to foreign non-banks. Six
of the remaining top lending destinations are located in Western Europe (about 17%), the
other two being Japan (3%) and Poland (1.5%). Together, the ten countries account for
more than 90% of total lending to non-banks. The micro-level perspective is mostly in line
with the observations at the aggregate level. The US and UK continue to be the two primary
target countries for non-bank credit. Western European countries remain important as well,
even though the rank ordering changes. Interestingly, Japan is no longer among the top
lending destinations. In contrast, while Russia was not among the top ten countries based
on aggregate data, it ranks in ninth place on the basis of disaggregated data.
9
A closer look at the disaggregated data provides further interesting insights into bank
heterogeneity in portfolio holdings. For example, the standard deviations are large and
frequently a multiple of the respective medians for all countries except the US and UK.
This indicates that German banks take quite different views on the desirability of lending
to specific countries. This heterogeneous behaviour is not confined to emerging economies
like Russia or Poland, but is observable in highly developed economies like France or the
Netherlands as well. Overall, the descriptive analysis of the primary lending destinations
suggests that it is crucial to control for bank heterogeneity in our empirical investigation of
country-level frictions.
3 Benchmark portfolios
3.1 Methodology
The goal of this paper is to examine which country-specific frictions drive a wedge between
banks' actual portfolios and benchmark portfolios, ie portfolios we could expect to observe as
the outcome of optimal international diversification in the absence of those frictions.8
In a fashion similar to Buch et al. (2010) and García-Herrero and Vázquez (2007), we
compute these benchmark portfolios by applying the Markowitz (1952, 1959) mean-variance
framework on the basis of representative assets. We make some amendments to the bench-
mark portfolios in order to make them more suitable for our analysis. Most importantly, we
account for the fact that portfolio weights obtained from mean-variance optimisation over
representative assets are invariant to the size of the respective economies and their capacity
to absorb credit. We therefore introduce more realism by correcting for credit demand.
Representative assets. We interpret a bank's benchmark international credit portfolio
as arising from an optimal choice from a universe of representative assets -- one for every
country in our sample. The decision to lend to a particular country or, more precisely, its
non-bank private sector can be regarded as granting a loan to a "typical", representative
company in that country.9 It is this company's economic and financial situation which the
representative asset is intended to proxy.
8There may exist other frictions in portfolio allocation. For instance, rebalancing any kind of investment
portfolio will generally entail some additional fixed transaction costs. In many cases the expected benefits
will not outweigh those costs, leading to more stable portfolios than would be the case without them. These
frictions differ by asset class, and can be quite substantial in the allocation of bank credit (especially as
compared to more standardised transactions, such as commodity contracts on futures exchanges). While we
focus on country-specific frictions in this paper, we account for the fact that fixed transaction costs may deter
banks from massively rebalancing their credit portfolios.
9Here and in the following, whenever we refer to a country, we mean that country's non-bank private
sector (see 2.2 for our choice of lending aggregate).
10
The mean-variance framework then captures the trade-off between risk and return that
banks face when lending internationally: all other things equal, they will prefer countries in
which loan repayments are expected to be higher or less volatile. Crucially, in a portfolio
context banks may even consider lending to a country for which repayments are expected to
be relatively low, or volatile, or both. The rationale is that banks can exploit less-than-perfect
correlation between one country's loan repayments and those in the rest of the portfolio to
improve the risk-return profile of their international credit portfolio as a whole. Hence,
the benefits of international portfolio diversification are greater the less aligned a country's
economy with the business cycles of other countries.
To measure banks' expected risk and return in international lending, we would ideally
like to use corporate bond indices. However, we found data availability to be too limited
for non-Western countries.10 Since the benefits of portfolio diversification result in large
part from the inclusion of countries with relatively asynchronous business cycles, a sample
dominated by developed countries (from the Western hemisphere) with strong business cycle
co-movements would underestimate the potential for international portfolio diversification.
Hence, we choose a stock market index (from MSCI Barra) as the representative asset, ie
we map the international credit allocation problem into one among national equity indices.
This allows us to construct a dataset with a representative sample of 35 countries from all
regions of the world which comprehensively reflects the investment opportunity set of German
banks.11
The firm-value model by Merton (1974) provides a compelling rationale for the idea that
the stock market should contain information about creditworthiness. In a nutshell, the payoff
to holders of a company's risky debt is interpreted as the sum of safe debt, ie the face value,
and a short put option on the company's asset value with strike price equal to the face value
of debt. A firm's debt value and default probability thus depend on the development of its
asset value: while the expected rate of return on the firm's asset value raises the value of
risky debt and reduces the probability of default, the opposite holds for the volatility of the
asset value. Since the value of a firm's assets is not observable, industry models descending
from Merton-type firm-value models infer the asset value and its development over time from
that of a company's stock.12
10This has also been pointed out by Buch et al. (2010) who use government bond indices as representative
assets instead, leaving them with 23 countries for the years 1995 through 2003.
11The broader country coverage by using equity instead of corporate bond indices also leads to higher
cross-country heterogeneity in the frictions we examine. Therefore, we should be better able to identify the
relevant effects.
12That is the case, for instance, in Moody's KMV. For details on this and other credit risk models, see
Kealhofer (2003), Crosbie and Bohn (2003), and Crouhy et al. (2000).
11
We take that as the starting point for our optimisation and proxy a country's represen-
tative firm by the return moments of its respective MSCI Barra stock market index.13 Each
equity index in isolation is characterised by expected return  and standard deviation . It
follows from above that banks will, ceteris paribus, prefer companies from countries with
higher 's and lower 's. In addition, the pairwise correlations  of national indices proxy
for the degree to which equity markets (and business cycles) in the respective countries move
together. At lower values of , banks are more likely to engage in diversification between
countries.
Table 3 reports regional return characteristics at the end of 2007 for our sample of 35
countries. Interestingly, monthly mean returns are highest in South America and South &
Southeast Asia (1.9% each), and lowest in Western and Eastern Europe (0.7% each). Despite
a relatively high figure for the developed region of North America (1.4%), mean returns in
regions consisting primarily of developing and emerging economies tend to exceed those
in developed regions (also see Table A.2). However, Western Europe and North America
carry substantially lower individual risk. Their return standard deviations of 5.3 and 5.5%,
respectively, are lower than those of any other region in the world. This suggests that their
lending environments are more stable than other parts of the world. In contrast, the regions
with the highest mean returns, South America and South & Southeast Asia, are also those
with the highest standard deviations (10.6 and 9.4%, respectively). This indicates a risk-
return trade-off in international lending.
The return correlations presented in Table 3 underline the potential diversification gains
that might be realised by lending abroad. As expected, correlations are consistently higher
within than between regions. The correlation between Western Europe and South & South
East Asia (0.28), for instance, is less than half that of Western European countries amongst
each other (0.65). Returns are also highly correlated between Western Europe and North
America (0.59), while correlations are significantly lower with all other regions of the world,
which consist predominantly of emerging an developing economies. Returns in the latter
group of countries are far from being perfectly aligned with each other as well. This suggests
that explicitly discriminating between single regions and countries in the emerging and de-
veloping world, rather than treating them as a homogeneous block, may further increase the
benefits from diversification.
13To keep our analysis tractable, we only borrow from industry models that stock prices contain valuable
information on the development of a firm's creditworthiness, but do not employ any of the sophistications (eg,
as introduced in Moody's KMV). At the cost of losing some precision, this should still give a broadly accurate
and consistent picture across countries. Moreover, one may argue that national equity indices only reflect the
financial health of large, publicly listed companies and might give an incomplete view of the representative
company whenever smaller, non-listed companies are doing better or worse. While this may be the case at
a point in time, it would have to occur systematically and for protracted periods of time to present a major
shortcoming of our approach.

Portfolio optimisation. At the portfolio level, banks are assumed to minimise the
return volatility  for any given level of expected return , or maximise  for any given
level of . They are assumed to borrow at a risk-free rate r in the interbank market14 and
optimally invest the funds in the risky representative assets under short-selling constraints.15
Optimality is achieved when the Sharpe ratio -r

of the overall portfolio is maximised. This
is the case for any point on the capital market line connecting the risk-free asset and the
tangency portfolio of risky representative assets on the efficient frontier. Any bank preferring
higher 's and lower 's will choose a portfolio along that line, regardless of its degree of risk
aversion. This portfolio is simply a mixture of the riskless asset and the tangency portfolio.16
More risk-averse banks invest more in the former and less in the latter, but the composition of
the risky tangency portfolio is the same for all banks.17 The optimal relative country shares
14We focus on large international German banks (see 2.2) that rely heavily on short-term interbank loans
to fund their operations rather than retail deposits.
15Recall that we are ultimately interested in international bank loan portfolios. We rule out the possibility
of short selling because, in that context, it lacks an intuitive explanation and does not appear economically
sensible.
16This separation theorem was first put forward in Tobin (1958), even though, in the strict sense, it applies
to unconstrained portfolios only.
17This holds to the extent that banks possess homogeneous information and expectations. More impor-
tantly, it also requires that all banks be able to realise returns in the same way. We are aware that this
assumption may be somewhat restrictive. For example, a bank located in the western part of Germany might
have closer ties to, or more precise knowledge of, markets in, say, the Benelux countries. It may therefore
find itself at an advantage over other German banks in picking borrowers and exploiting profit opportunities.
In all probability, the optimal portfolios will thus not be completely identical across banks: for any given
bank, they are likely to differ somewhat with respect to the computed portfolio. The computation of bank-
individual benchmark portfolios at this stage would hence require knowledge of their specific expertise and
strategy towards particular countries, which are naturally unobserved. However, one can reasonably assume
that these are inherent traits of individual banks with little, if any, change over time. This allows us to
account for heterogeneity later by including bank-country specific effects in our regression analysis (see 4.1).
13
from mean-variance optimisation can then be obtained as the weights of representative assets
in the tangency portfolio.
The inputs for the optimisation (ie, expected returns, standard deviations, and correla-
tions) are unobserved and need to be estimated from historical returns. Hence, we use a
rolling-window approach on the basis of monthly returns. This yields a portfolio for each
year-end in the sample period.18 We also account for the caveat that the optimality and
out-of-sample performance of the computed portfolios can often be severely impaired when
point estimates are treated as if they were known with certainty. That is because optimal
portfolios are very sensitive with respect to the inputs. In particular, mean returns are sub-
ject to estimation error (see, eg, Michaud 1989). Neglecting this often leads to portfolios that
are unrealistically exclusive, ie contain only very few of the initial assets, and are unstable
over time.19 To mitigate this, we employ the portfolio resampling technique from the asset
allocation literature (see, eg, Jorion 1992, Michaud 1998, or Scherer 2002) which amounts
to parametrically bootstrapping from a distribution characterised by the estimates of the
expected returns, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients. The idea is to calculate
a separate efficient frontier and optimal representative-asset portfolio for each draw, with
the bootstrapped optimal portfolio obtaining as the average of optimal portfolios from those
draws.20 Indeed, the resampled portfolio weights turn out to be more balanced and much
less volatile.
Accounting for credit demand. The weights from (resampled) mean-variance opti-
misation over representative assets do not consider potential credit demand. A small country,
for example, does not possess the same capacity to absorb credit as larger countries do. How-
ever, pure mean-variance optimisation may assign a weight well above the small country's
share of credit demand relative to the countries in the portfolio. Sensible benchmark port-
folios ought to account for this and be anchored around the relative credit demands of the
other countries in our sample. In line with the terminology introduced by Black and Litter-
18We choose the length of the rolling window to be 9 years due to a trade-off. On the one hand, we
require that the window be long enough to give reasonably reliable parameter estimates. We would like to
characterise returns through the business cycle in order to learn about country fundamentals as well as to
limit the impact that short-term developments, for instance, stock market rallies, might have. The use of
120 months of data, as very often done in the asset allocation literature, would therefore seem appropriate.
On the other hand, restrictions on the availability of the indices mean we would have to drop several Eastern
European countries with a major foreign bank presence (see, eg, de Haas and van Lelyveld 2006, Havrylchyk
and Jurzyk 2011), and potentially strategic importance for German banks in particular. However, we can
include those countries at the quite limited cost of reducing the window length by just one year to 9 years.
19The latter would be a particularly undesirable property since we mentioned earlier on that, in the presence
of (fixed) transaction costs, banks should be expected to shy away from massively rebalancing their credit
portfolios on an ongoing basis.
20We make 1,000 draws and trace out each efficient frontier along 100 equally divided returns between the
minimum and maximum returns. For a detailed description of the procedure, see Scherer (2002) or Michaud
(1998).
14
man (1992), those relative credit demands can be thought of as neutral starting points for an
international credit portfolio. Mean-variance optimisation then provides the bank with views
on the relative merit of investing in different countries from a diversification perspective, so it
can adjust the neutral weights accordingly. As credit demand is frequently proxied by GDP
in the literature and, for our purposes, it also has the desirable property of being largely
unaffected by the country-specific frictions of interest, we use relative GDP shares as neutral
anchors.21 Since it is unclear how much confidence a bank would place in mean-variance op-
timisation as opposed to the neutral weights at any given point in time, we employ a simple
heuristic and define the final benchmark weight for a country as the unweighted average of its
weight from resampled mean-variance optimisation and its relative GDP share.22 However,
our results are robust to alternative weighting schemes which put gradually more weight on
the outcome from mean-variance optimisation and less on relative GDP shares.
3.2 Deviations from the benchmark
Table 4 gives a first overview of how German banks' actual portfolios deviate from the
benchmark portfolios for the top ten lending destinations at the end of 2007. The degree of
overweighting is the difference between a country's median actual weight and its benchmark
weight according to the optimisation procedure outlined in 3.1.
Eight of the ten most important lending destinations are overweighted to varying degrees
relative to the benchmark, while Italy and Russia are underweighted. The US and UK
are the two most overweighted countries in German banks' credit portfolios (13.9 and 10.5
percentage points, respectively).23 Even though the actual weight on the US is about twice
that of the UK, their degrees of overweighting are quite similar. This is due to the much
higher benchmark weight for the US. In contrast, Russia is heavily underweighted (­9.2
percentage points) relative to a similarly high benchmark weight of 10.2%.
Overall, Table 4 indicates a significant potential for diversification by lending to un-
derweighted countries. In the next section, we analyse empirically which country-specific
frictions explain why countries are over- or underweighted.
21See de Haas and van Lelyveld (2011), Altunbas et al. (2009), or Haselmann (2006) for the use of GDP
as a credit-demand proxy in different contexts.
22Similar heuristics are often applied in other contexts with multiple plausible decision criteria, but in
which no single criterion is clearly superior. For instance, the shares of national central banks in the European
Central Bank's capital are calculated using a key which is the unweighted average of countries' population
and GDP shares. Also see Altman et al. (2002), who propose a "fifty-fifty" weighting scheme as a simple and
transparent reference point in the context of shock analysis.
23This is also the case for the years 2003­2006.

the difference in percentage points between actual and benchmark weights. Actual weights are median country shares based on

refer to the sample of 18 internationally oriented German banks and the representative set of 35 countries.
4 Empirical setup
4.1 Estimation framework
We use the benchmark portfolios as the reference point for banks' actual international credit
portfolios to investigate the impact of country-specific frictions with the following econometric
model:
owcbt
=  + INTEGct
 + INSTct
 + Xct
 + cb
+ cbt .
Here, owcbt
= wcbt
- optct is the degree of overweighting of country c in bank b's interna-
tional credit portfolio at the end of year t, ie the difference between the actual weight wcbt
and the optimal weight optct from the benchmark. cb is a bank-country specific effect that
captures individual bank behaviour towards specific countries in our dataset.
For instance, some banks may be better able to exploit investment opportunities in certain
countries due to greater expertise or experience in a market while others may single out
strategically important countries without the aim to diversify. Due to the bank-country
dimension of our dataset we can control for such unobserved time-invariant bank-country
specific heterogeneity. This is a major advantage over the study by Buch et al. (2010).
The country-specific frictions are included in the vectors INTEGct and INSTct, and
are described in the subsection below. INTEGct is a matrix of variables that measure
the degree of economic integration. Variables included are geographical distance (DIST), a
16
dummy variable which indicates whether the lending destination has a common border with
Germany (BORDER), and its relative importance as a destination for German foreign direct
investment in the real sector (FDI). We also check whether eurozone membership (EURO)
biases banks' credit portfolios towards eurozone countries.
INSTct controls for the institutional and regulatory framework. It includes variables on
the overall institutional environment (INSTITUTION) and the degree of private monitoring
in the destination country (PMI). Moreover, we account for banking regulations such as
entry requirements in the host country (ENTRY), regulatory requirements regarding bank
capitalisation (CAPITAL), while restrictions on non-traditional bank activities are measured
by RESTRICT. We also control for whether the destination country hosts a major financial
centre (CENTRE).
Xct is a matrix of additional control variables. The country-specific frictions are described
in greater detail in the following. Table A.3 provides a summary of their definitions and data
sources. As most of the variables do not vary over time, we estimate the model by random
effects. We do use fixed effects, though, to check the robustness of the results for the time-
varying variables in our model. Also note that we cannot include bank variables in the
regression as level terms since the regression coefficients would be zero by definition.24 As a
further robustness check, however, we later exploit the bank-level dimension of our dataset
by including interaction terms to identify whether the banks in our sample differ in their
reactions to frictions.
4.2 Country-specific frictions
The previous section has shown that German banks' actual credit portfolios deviate from
our benchmark portfolios. In line with the literature on international banking, we identify
the following frictions which might cause the over- or underweighting of countries in banks'
portfolios.
(1) Economic integration. We expect the degree of economic integration with Ger-
many to be an important determinant of banks' deviations from the benchmark portfolios.
To measure economic integration we use the following variables:
Distance (DIST) is measured as the log great-circle distance between the most important
cities or agglomerations of Germany and the destination country. It has long been used in
24This is the case because we look at countries' shares in the international credit portfolios of German
banks. Those are defined as percentages. Hence, even though larger banks, on average, extend more credit
to any given country than smaller banks, the portfolio shares for each bank in any given year always add up
to 100%. Equivalently, the over- or underweightings for a bank will add up to zero. The regression coefficient
of any bank variable in levels will therefore be zero as well.
17
estimating gravity equations in international trade, and has recently been investigated in the
literature on the international holdings and flows of financial assets as well.25 That literature
has identified two rival hypotheses for the impact of distance (see, eg, Portes et al. 2001).
According to the first hypothesis, the absolute level of holdings or flows should increase with
distance since business cycle correlations tend to decrease with distance (also see Table 3).
This indicates a positive relationship between distance and absolute holdings or flows. The
second hypothesis postulates that distance is a proxy for the severity of informational frictions
because information flows are generally lower between more distant countries. This suggests
a negative relationship between distance and absolute holdings or flows.
In this paper, we explicitly model diversification opportunities and evaluate international
credit portfolios relative to the benchmark portfolios containing optimal country weights.
The benchmark portfolios already account for the first hypothesis from above, according to
which the potential for diversification increases with distance. Hence, our regressions amount
to a test of the hypothesis that informational frictions increase monotonically with distance,
and that more distant countries should be less overweighted, or more underweighted, relative
to the benchmark. This suggests a negative coefficient on DIST.
As an alternative measure, we include a dummy indicating whether a destination coun-
try borders on Germany (BORDER) . By the same reasoning, we would expect a positive
relationship between BORDER and the degree of overweighting.
Outward foreign direct investment in the real sector (FDI) is included to account for
the fact that banks may follow domestic companies when those venture abroad and set
up operations in a foreign country.26 This decision might not be primarily driven by the
desire to seek a particular foreign exposure but to retain an already existing customer base
at home. In a way, this follow-your-client motive can be viewed as competing with that of
international diversification. This may be particularly relevant in a bank-dominated financial
system like Germany where many firms rely on their so-called "Hausbank" for funding rather
than on capital markets (see, eg, Onetti and Pisoni 2009). To investigate the follow-your-
client motive, we use a country's share in the real-sector outward FDI stocks of German
non-banks.27 In line with the follow-your-customer hypothesis, we would expect a positive
impact on overweighting.
25See Portes et al. (2001) and Portes and Rey (2005) for cross-border trade in equities, corporate bonds,
and government bonds, and Aviat and Coeurdacier (2007) for bilateral bank asset holdings.
26This rationale for the international activity of banks has been stressed as early as Goldberg and Saunders
(1980, 1981). However, empirical evidence has been mixed. Recent studies (eg, Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005,
Berger et al. 2003, Seth et al. 1998, Williams 1998) tend to paint a more nuanced picture of the importance
of the follow-your-client motive than earlier contributions (eg, Yamori 1998, Brealey and Kaplanis 1996).
27We do not include FDI by banks or other financial firms in that measure. The establishment of subsidiaries
in a foreign country by banks would not only be reflected in an increase of the FDI measure, but also of that
country's overweighting in banks' portfolios. We would therefore introduce simultaneity into our estimation.
18
Eurozone membership (EURO) might also affect whether a country is overweighted or
underweighted against the benchmark. Hence, we include a dummy variable which takes on
a value of one if a country is a member of the eurozone, and zero otherwise. Several empirical
studies provide evidence that the adoption of the euro may enhance financial integration.28
Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2010) mention different potential channels explaining those results.
They identify the elimination of exchange rate risk and legislative-regulatory reforms along
with the introduction of the euro as important drivers. In any case, eurozone membership
should be positively related to the degree of overweighting.
(2) Institutional and regulatory environment. Over- or underweighting is also
likely to depend on the institutional and regulatory environment in the destination country
which is measured by the following variables:29
The overall institutional environment (INSTITUTION) variable captures the quality of
governance in a country. It is the simple average of six governance indicators compiled by the
World Bank (see Table A.3 for a list). Higher values indicate a more developed institutional
environment. We expect INSTITUTION to be positively associated with the overweighting
measure.
We also include the Private Monitoring Index (PMI) to examine whether scrutiny from
private market forces helps explain deviations from the benchmark. The index mainly reflects
the amount of financial information banks have to disclose to the public. Higher values are
associated with stricter requirements. On the one hand, we would expect banks to steer clear
of markets with higher reporting requirements. This effect would unfold solely through local
operations as banks' cross-border operations would remain unaffected. On the other hand,
better private monitoring of banks is positively associated with a higher level of development
in the banking sector (Barth et al. 2006, 2008). Furthermore, countries which require banks
to provide the public with a significant amount of information might apply similar reporting
standards to non-banks as well. In that case, higher index values would indicate increased
transparency on the part of borrowers. This would enhance the ability of banks to screen
or monitor potential borrowers and thereby increase the attractiveness of the destination
country. Hence, the relationship between PMI and overweighting may also be positive.
The Entry into Banking Requirements Index (ENTRY) measures the restrictiveness of
requirements that banks have to meet in order to obtain a banking licence. It considers
28Lane (2006) and Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005) provide evidence of a eurozone bias in the international
holdings by euro-area countries in bonds and equity, respectively. Similarly, Blank and Buch (2007) detect a
positive and significant impact of the euro on the bilateral foreign assets held by banks.
29These indices are constructed from the World Bank's Bank Regulation and Supervision Database ac-
cording to the methodology in Barth et al. (2001). We use values from the second and third waves to capture
the situation in the years 2003­2004 and 2005­2007, respectively (see Barth et al. 2008).
19
whether it is necessary to submit, for instance, organisational charts, financial projections
and information, the prior banking experience of managers and directors, or the sources of
funds for capitalisation. The effect of this restrictiveness on the degree of overweighting is not
clear a priori. On the one hand, greater requirements make it harder for banks to obtain a
licence. This hampers banks' ability to serve their potential clients through local operations.
To the extent that those cannot be fully substituted by lending from banks' headquarters,
this would imply a tendency for countries with stricter requirements to be underweighted,
or less overweighted. On the other hand, (foreign) banks may be attracted by more heavily
regulated markets if they hope to reap higher profits due to lower competition, mainly from
domestic banks (see, eg, Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005). Such opportunities for excess profits
are not reflected in the benchmark. Banks might therefore also overweight countries with
stricter requirements.
The Capital Regulatory Index (CAPITAL) captures regulations pertaining to bank cap-
italisation. It considers factors such as minimum capital requirements, the stringency with
which losses have to be deducted from reported capital, or the assets allowable as capital.
The potential impact of capital regulation on overweighting is through banks' local opera-
tions or, more precisely, subsidiaries. In contrast to branches, subsidiaries are incorporated
under local law and are legally separate entities from their parent banks. The latter generally
do not assume responsibility for the liabilities of their subsidiaries. Therefore, subsidiaries
need to be capitalised independently and have to comply with the capital regulations in the
host country.30 While more demanding regulations might reduce the attractiveness of a lend-
ing destination, they could also give (large) foreign banks a competitive edge over (small)
domestic banks because they may be better able to raise capital than domestic institutions.
Restrictions on bank activities (RESTRICT) might also affect the propensity of banks to
overweight a destination country in their portfolios. For example, banks may want to engage
in business other than traditional lending. Prohibitions or limitations on such business might
bias banks against a particular market more generally. This, in turn, could have a negative
spillover effect on the amount of standard bank loans granted. We investigate this by using
an index measuring the restrictions on banks with regard to securities, insurance, or real
estate business as well as the ownership of non-financial firms. Since higher values imply
30However, Cerutti et al. (2007) point out that the distinction between branches and subsidiaries has
become rather blurred in practice. Parent banks have increasingly used "ring-fencing" provisions to limit the
responsibility for their branches, too. Host countries are likely to differ in the degree to which they allow
banks to negotiate such provisions. While we do not possess data on that, countries with more stringent
capital regulations might also be less inclined to relieve parent banks from their responsibility to support
their branches. Then, the estimated effect of capital regulations would also work through the channel of
branches.

greater restrictiveness, we would expect a negative relationship between RESTRICT and the
degree of overweighting.
Finally, we account for the presence of financial centres (CENTRE).31 Controlling for
financial centres is necessary because our lending aggregate also contains lending to insur-
ance companies and other financial institutions, which are, technically, non-banks. Since
internationally oriented banks are highly active in the money markets, the overweighting we
observe for countries with financial centres is partly the consequence of lending to non-bank
financial counterparties located there. However, overweighting a financial centre for that
reason cannot be considered a strategic decision to seek exposure to a specific country risk.
For variable definitions and data sources see Table A.3.
5 Results
Our regression analysis proceeds as follows. As a baseline, we estimate different models
including the frictions related to economic integration and the institutional and regulatory
environment. We then augment those by additional country controls for the level of competi-
tion and development of banking markets as well as the degree of risk-taking in the banking
sector. Finally, we present a number of further robustness checks of our results. Tables A.4
and A.5 show descriptive statistics and correlations, respectively, of all variables used in the
regressions.
5.1 Baseline results
We first estimate a model with the frictions related to economic integration (Model 1). To
control for the institutional environment in the host country, we add our overall governance
indicator (Model 2). We then account for banking regulations instead of the overall institu-
tional framework (Model 3), before including all institutional and regulatory variables jointly
(Model 4). The results are presented in Table 5.
In line with the follow-your-customer hypothesis, we find a large and significantly positive
relationship between outward foreign direct investment in the real sector (FDI) and the degree
of overweighting in all regressions. This is consistent with the view that existing economic
integration in the real sector promotes financial integration.
The euro area dummy (EURO), in contrast, is positive but insignificant indicating that
the impact of the euro on credit market integration might be limited. This contrasts with
31In line with the literature, the countries classified as financial centres in our dataset are Ireland, Switzer-
land, and the United Kingdom.

Lane (2006), who analyses the bilateral composition of international bond portfolios and
shows that euro area member countries disproportionately invest in one another relative to
other country pairs. He interprets this as evidence for a euro area bias.32 Jappelli and
Pagano (2008) find a positive effect of the euro on bond and stock markets as well. However,
a considerable body of empirical literature also suggests that credit markets have integrated
much more slowly than bond or stock markets, and that they are still separated along national
lines (see, eg, Adam et al. 2002, Baele et al. 2004).33 Furthermore, our finding could also be
due to the fact that we only consider large, internationally oriented banks that are better
at managing exchange rate risk and for which, as a consequence, eurozone membership may
matter less.34
Distance from and a common border with Germany do not seem to have an impact on the
international credit allocation of German banks either. Since diversification opportunities
related to distance are incorporated in the benchmark portfolios, both variables capture
informational asymmetries. If informational frictions increase monotonically with distance,
we would expect more distant countries to be less overweighted, or more underweighted,
relative to the benchmark. Our results suggest this is not the case as the coefficients on both
DIST and BORDER turn out to be insignificant.35 This is in line with Buch et al. (2010) who
do not detect a significant relationship between distance and the probability of a country's
being overweighted either.
While most frictions related to economic integration do not matter, frictions related to the
institutional environment in general, and banking regulations in particular, do. The positive
and significant coefficient for ENTRY, for instance, suggests that banks overweight countries
with stricter entry requirements. Focarelli and Pozzolo (2005) argue that banks may be
attracted by more heavily regulated markets if they hope to reap higher profits due to a
lower level of competition. This corresponds to findings of Barth et al. (2004) and Demirgüç-
Kunt et al. (2004).36 They show that financial systems with greater entry restrictions record
higher net interest margins and overhead expenditures due to a lower level competition
32Further evidence on bond and equity portfolio composition is provided by De Santis and Gérard (2006).
Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2010) more closely investigate the underlying channels of the euro's effects on financial
integration. They find that the euro's impact on financial integration is primarily driven by the elimination
of currency risk. Legislative-regulatory convergence has also contributed to the spur of cross-border financial
transactions, while trade in goods does not play a key role in explaining the euro's positive effect on financial
integration.
33Adam et al. (2002)and Baele et al. (2004) show that there are persistent interest rate differentials in
the medium and long term in the corporate loan and the consumer credit markets. More recent evidence is
provided by the European Central Bank (2011).
34More generally, German banks' foreign exchange exposure is fairly limited, indicating that they hedge
themselves against those risks (Deutsche Bundesbank 2011).
35To check whether these results are robust to collinearity between DIST and BORDER, we re-run the
regressions dropping each variable in turn. The coefficients remain insignificant throughout.
36For further evidence, see Claessens and Laeven (2004).
23
than other countries. This is consistent with our results. Once we include the average net
interest margin and stock market capitalisation in the host country as additional controls,
ENTRY loses significance (see Table 6). A lower level of banking sector competition and
efficiency may allow foreign banks to generate excess profits due to superior management
skills and technologies required to run international operations. Such profit opportunities
are not reflected in our benchmark.
Opportunities for excess profits could also explain the results for RESTRICT and CAPI-
TAL. The positive coefficient for RESTRICT indicates that banks overweight countries with
stricter activity restrictions. This may again be the consequence of reduced competition
and efficiency in a destination country's banking sector as shown by Barth et al. (2004) and
Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2004). The evidence is weak, however, as RESTRICT turns out to
be insignificant in many regressions. CAPITAL, in contrast, is significant in all regressions.
German banks appear to overweight countries with stricter capital requirements, which might
reduce the competitive strength of low-quality banks vis-à-vis high quality banks. This may
increase lending rates and encourage the entry of foreign banks (Boot and Marinc 2006).
Furthermore, the subsidiaries of (large) foreign banks might have easier access to capital
through their parents and, hence, be better able to meet higher capital requirements than
(small) domestic banks. This may allow them to increase their lending and market share
relative to locally incorporated banks.
INSTITUTION, the aggregate governance indicator, is insignificant in most regressions.
This contrasts with the Private Monitoring Index (PMI). Its positive and significant coeffi-
cient suggests that German banks overweight countries with higher reporting requirements
for banks. Barth et al. (2006, 2008) offer an explanation for this. They show that better
private monitoring of banks is positively associated with a higher level of development in the
banking sector. This is consistent with our results. Once we control for the level of banking
sector size and development, PMI becomes insignificant (see Table 6). This indicates that
the positive effect of PMI on overweighting is primarily through its impact on the size and
development of the banking sector in the host country. CENTRE is positive and significant
as well underlining the need to control for the presence of financial centres.
5.2 Additional country controls
As a first robustness check and to learn more about the channels proposed above, we augment
the regression containing all frictions (Model 4) by additional country controls.37 The results
are presented in Table 6. The ratios of private credit to GDP (PCRDGDP) and stock market
capitalisation to GDP (STMKTCAP) control for the size and development of banking and
37All additional controls are from the World Bank's Financial Structure Database (Beck et al. 2010).
24
financial markets (Models 5 and 7). In addition, we include the average net interest margin
(NIM) and the log average Z-score of the banking sector (ZSCORE) as proxies for the level
of competition and bank risk-taking in the host country, respectively (Models 6 and 7).
The ratio of private credit to GDP (PCRDGDP) has been used as a proxy for the size
and development of banking markets (see, eg, Driessen and Laeven 2007, Beck et al. 2010).
Countries with more developed banking systems should have deeper markets with better
diversification opportunities. Moreover, banking sector development is likely to depend on
the institutional and regulatory environment in the host country, both on the characteristics
we are able to control for and those for which we are not. Hence, PCRDGDP may also be
regarded as a robustness check for the impact of the frictions we investigate and as capturing
"residual" frictions. Since frictions should decrease with banking sector development, we
would expect PCRDGDP to be positively related to the degree of overweighting. This is
what we find. In line with our hypothesis, PCRDGDP turns out to be significantly positive
in all regressions.
We also include the ratio of stock market capitalisation over GDP, which is often regarded
as an indicator for the relative size and level of development of financial markets (Driessen
and Laeven 2007, Beck et al. 2010). In contrast to PCRDGDP, STMKTCAP is significantly
negative, indicating that German banks tend to underweight countries with larger and more
developed stock markets, possibly due to a lower demand for bank finance and greater com-
petition with other non-bank intermediaries and financial markets. This is supported by the
fact that countries with higher net interest margins are overweighted by German banks as
suggested by the positive and significant coefficient for NIM. The net interest margin is often
used to measure the operational efficiency and competitive nature of a banking sector, where
higher margins are generally associated with less competition (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2004,
Beck et al. 2010).38 Interestingly, ENTRY becomes less significant once we include NIM in
the regression. This supports our earlier interpretation that ENTRY may proxy for the level
of competition in the banking sector.
Finally, we include the Z-score of each country's banking system. The Z-score measures
bank stability, with higher scores indicating greater stability (see, eg, Boyd and Nicoló 2005,
Laeven and Levine 2009).39 If banks preferred countries with a more stable banking system,
38The net interest margin (NIM) equals interest income minus interest expense divided by interest-bearing
assets. As a further robustness test, we replace NIM by the ratio of overhead costs divided by total assets
(OVERHEAD). Demirgüç-Kunt et al. (2004) argue that OVERHEAD is an alternative indicator for the level
of efficiency and market competition, since higher overhead costs reflect greater cost inefficiencies and market
power. The coefficient for OVERHEAD turns out to be significant and positive in line with the hypothesis
that German banks tend to overweight countries with a less efficient and competitive banking sector. The
results are not reported for the sake of brevity.
39It is defined as the ratio of the return on assets plus the capital ratio divided by the standard deviation
of the return on assets. If profits are normally distributed, the Z-score is the inverse of the probability of

we would expect them to overweight countries with a higher Z-score. This is not the case.
In contrast, our results suggest that German banks tend to overweight countries with a
less stable banking system in their portfolio as indicated by the significant and negative
coefficient for ZSCORE. Since, on average, net interest margins declined over the sample
period, the banks in our sample might have increased their lending to less stable countries
either deliberately to raise their profits or ignorantly due to a failure of risk management
systems that reduced risk perception.
The results for ZSCORE also support the mechanisms of our benchmark portfolio model.
If the risks banks incurred in the run-up to the crisis are not fully captured by this model,
we would expect countries to receive a lower benchmark weight due to smaller risk-adjusted
returns once we control for these risks. In particular, countries exposed to a high level of
banking sector risk should receive lower benchmark weights. Hence, these countries should be
even more overweighted in our model. The negative and significant coefficient for ZSCORE
indicates that this is the case. The results for ZSCORE, therefore, do not only suggest that
banks increasingly lent to countries with less stable banking sectors, but also supports the
mechanisms of our portfolio model. They also indicate that the results for the other control
variables are robust even if we control for the level of banking sector risk.
Overall, our results suggest that German banks tend to overweight countries with larger
and more developed banking markets that offer greater opportunities to generate excess
profits due to a lower level of competition and efficiency. We also find evidence that the
banks in our sample lent to more risky countries, possibly to raise their profits or due to a
lower risk perception. More importantly, however, the results for the remaining variables are
largely unchanged. Only ENTRY and PMI become insignificant in line with our hypothesis
that they may proxy for the level of competition and development in the banking sector.
5.3 Robustness checks
As a last step, we perform several tests to check the robustness of our findings. The results are
reported in Table 7. First, we test whether our results are robust with respect to the sample
period from 2003 to 2007. Even though the most severe period of the financial crisis started
in September 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the first stage of the crisis already
began in 2007. For example, starting in August 2007 banking flows slowed down primarily
among developed countries due to increased uncertainty among banks (Milesi-Ferretti and
Tille 2011). A priori, we would think that this should not affect our results because the first
insolvency. More specifically, it indicates the number of standard deviations below the expected value of a
bank's return on assets at which equity is depleted and the bank is insolvent (Roy 1952, Hannan and Hanweck
1988, Boyd et al. 1993).
27
stage of the crisis was mainly limited to the interbank market, while we focus on non-bank
credit. However, to check the robustness of our results, we restrict our sample period to the
years from 2003 to 2006 and obtain similar results (Models 8 and 9).
Second, we test whether our results are robust to the country sample. We are partic-
ularly concerned that our results may be driven by the inclusion of the US and UK since
they dominate in German banks' international credit portfolios (see Table 2). For this rea-
son, we exclude both countries from the sample and re-estimate our model. The results are
presented in Models 10 and 11 of Table 7. They confirm our findings for ENTRY and PMI.
CAPITAL also remains significant and positive. In addition, EURO becomes positive and
significant, possibly because the non-eurozone countries US and UK are both heavily over-
weighted against the benchmark. FDI, in contrast, is insignificant once we exclude the UK
and US. However, if we exclude both 2007 as well as the UK and the US, FDI is significantly
positive again. Furthermore, in all other robustness checks FDI remains significant and pos-
itive. Hence, the overall evidence is in support of the follow-your-customer hypothesis for
German banks. The results of the other control variables are also unchanged.
In addition, we exploit the bank-level dimension of our dataset by including interaction
terms between the country-specific frictions and bank size, proxied by total assets, to identify
whether banks react differently to country-specific factors. The size of a bank can be regarded
as a measure of its international orientation or its experience in different lines of business
with a variety of customers. Larger banks may also have stronger incentives to diversify
internationally (Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005). Deviations from the benchmark induced by a
country-specific factor might differ across banks, for instance because it may be easier for
larger banks to overcome informational asymmetries than smaller banks. Since we already
focus on a group of large and internationally oriented German banks, however, we would not
expect major differences in reactions for our sample. Indeed, we find that the interaction
terms turn out to be insignificant, whereas the level terms remain very similar in both
magnitude and significance. The country-specific frictions we identify as being important
determinants of international credit portfolios seem to affect all German banks in largely
equal measure. This supports our choice of bank sample.
We also test whether our results change if we re-estimate all models for those banks that
are considered systemically important by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Furthermore, we check
whether the results are robust to the exclusion of all countries that host an international
financial centre. Even though this considerably reduces the total number of observations,
the results remain unchanged. Finally, we estimate our model with the fixed instead of the
random effects estimator to test the robustness of the time-varying variables and confirm our
results. The results of these robustness tests are not reported for the sake of brevity.

German banks have massively increased their foreign exposure over the past two decades
by both an increase in their cross-border activities and the establishment of branches and
subsidiaries abroad. Therefore, major German banks are now heavily dependent on the de-
velopment of their foreign assets. At the same time, business cycles across the world continue
to exhibit notable asynchronicity, giving rise to international diversification opportunities.
In this paper, we investigate which country-specific determinants make German banks
overweight some countries and underweight others in their international credit portfolios.
More specifically, we ask which geographical, institutional, and regulatory frictions cause
German banks to leave opportunities for diversification unexploited. To this end, we construct
a bank-country panel for the period between 2003 and 2007 on the basis of the External
Position Reports of German Banks, a unique dataset provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank.
For large, internationally oriented German banks and a representative set of 35 countries
from all regions of the world, we compare banks' actual international credit portfolios to
mean-variance based benchmark portfolios that we would expect to observe in the absence
of country-specific frictions.
The results show that banking regulations are important determinants of the credit al-
location of German banks. We present robust evidence that countries with stricter capital
adequacy and entry requirements tend to be overweighted, primarily due to excess profits
resulting from a lower level of banking market competition. Moreover, German banks are
found to overweight countries with larger and more developed banking markets. In contrast,
geographical factors do not appear to matter. There is no evidence that informational asym-
metries are obstacles to international lending which increase monotonically with distance.
We also find support that German banks, in order to maintain existing lending relationships
at home, follow their domestic customers abroad when those set up operations in a foreign
country. Finally, the level of risk-taking in the host-country banking sector seems to matter
as well since we observe that the banks in our sample increased their lending to countries
with riskier banking sectors.
German banks' credit portfolios do not seem to be determined by country factors which
cannot change over time. Instead, there is reason to believe that, in the long run, changes
in and convergence of banking regulations as well as financial deepening of banking sectors
around the world will result in banks holding more diversified international credit portfolios.
Deviations from our benchmark portfolios should then gradually disappear and leave banks
with portfolios that make them more stable and resilient to country-specific shocks.
