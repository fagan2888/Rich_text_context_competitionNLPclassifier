Introduction
Translation is one of the most complicated tasks because it
involves an attempt to achieve accurate communication of
a message while attending to the form at the same time. A
translator's attempt in attaining form usually makes attaining
meaning more difficult (Rendall, 1997), and thus a translator
mostly needs to either sacrifice form or meaning. In other
words, a translator can rarely succeed in preserving both
form and meaning, in particular, in cases of two dissipate
languages, such as Arabic and English. Such a problem is
related to the question of what contributes to a good transla-
tion (Schulte, 2002), which is reflected in the different defi-
nitions of translation. Nida and Taber (1974), for example,
defined translation as reproducing the message of the source
language (SL) in a target language (TL) while keeping equiv-
alent meaning and style. Style, in this sense, may refer to
grammatical and syntactic patterns. For example, in Arabic,
the style is to foreground the most important and background
the least important in a certain context. This is not the case in
English, as there are fixed grammatical rules which require,
for instance, a subject to go before the verb or the object.
Another definition of translation was proposed by Newmark
(1988), who defined translation as producing an approxi-
mate equivalent of two languages at different levels, among
which thought and linguistic form are the most important.
Newmark's definition is similar to that of Nida and Taber,
as they also underscored the importance of linguistic form
equivalence. On the contrary, Catford (1965) viewed transla-
tion as the replacement of textual material in one language
(SL) by equivalent textual material in another language (TL).
These definitions of translation mostly highlight two main
concepts: meaning and linguistic form, which resulted in
the emergence of different schools of thoughts on transla-
tion that revolve around meaning and form. For example,
Larson (1984) differentiated between meaning-based trans-
lation and form-based translation. In a similar vein, Catford
(1965) believed that full equivalence in meaning and form in
the target text (TT) cannot always be fully achieved as it is

Grammar-Related Semantic Losses in
the Translation of the Holy Quran, with
Special Reference to Surah Al A'araf
(The Heights)
Noureldin Mohamed Abdelaal1 and Sabariah Md Rashid1
Abstract
Translating the Holy Quran is a challenging task. However, it is a necessity due to the large number of Muslims who do
not speak Arabic. To date, various translations are available for nonnative speakers of Arabic. These translations, however,
have revealed complete and partial translation losses. One type of such losses is grammatical loss, which sometimes occurs
due to differences between the source text (ST) and the target text (TT). This study aimed at investigating the grammatical
losses in the translation of the Holy Quran, with special reference to Surah Al A'araf, and the extent these losses cause
partial or complete semantic loss. Qualitative descriptive approach was adopted to analyze the data extracted from Abdel
Haleem's English translation of Surah Al A'araf. The study revealed losses occurring in translating grammatical aspects such
as conjunctions, syntactic order, duality, tense, and verbs. It was also found that grammatical losses contributed to semantic
losses, which are mostly partial semantic losses of the connotative or the expressive meanings. However, some of the
identified grammatical losses were found to cause complete semantic losses. This study suggests that appropriate translation
strategies be adopted to reduce loss in the translation.

difficult to transfer the form and meaning from a SL into a
TL. Related to this is what is explained by Nida (1975), who
explained that a translator may not encode a message accu-
rately when translating texts between two different cultures.
In this light, the main concern in translation is ensuring that
the form and meaning between the SL and TL are equivalent.
Newmark (1988), for instance, stated that problems in
translation could occur in grammar or lexicon. Much ear-
lier, Ervin and Bower (1952) argued that distortion of mean-
ing in translation could result from lexical, syntactical, or
cultural differences between languages. Correspondingly,
Darwish (2010) in Al-Hamdalla (1998) stated that difficulty
in translation could result from differences between lan-
guages in terms of syntactic, semantic, lexical, phonological,
and morphological features. Thus, it seems that grammatical
equivalence between a source text (ST) and a TT is not less
important than lexical equivalence.
The lack of equivalence problems at the grammatical
level may also cause challenges for a translator, especially
when he translates from Arabic to English. Arabic is a unique
language in its style and is completely different from English
in many of its features. The challenge becomes greater when
the ST is the Holy Quran, which is a sacred book that is
sought to be rendered as closely as possible to the authentic
meaning in the ST. Translating the Holy Quran seems to be
more challenging due to its being a sacred book, and due to
its unique language, which is the words of Allah Almighty.
Furthermore, the Holy Quran language has attributes which
make it challenging to translate the form and sense from the
ST to the TT.
To date, some studies have addressed the phenomenon of
syntactic and semantic problems in the translation of some
ayahs in the Holy Quran (e.g., Abdelaal & Md Rashid, 2015;
Ali, Brakhw, Nordin, & Ismail, 2012; Fathi & Nasser, 2009;
Khalaf & Yusoff, 2012). Studies have also been done on
certain syntactic aspects. For example, Al-Ghazalli (2012)
focused on the translation of the trilateral verbs in the Holy
Quran. Some studies have focused on certain aspects of
the text in the Holy Quran. However, these studies did not
exhaustively investigate the different grammatical losses in
the translation of the Holy Quran, and they did not either
investigate the extent these grammatical losses contribute to
the loss in the meaning conveyed, that is, the grammatical
losses in the translation of the Holy Quran resulting in com-
plete semantic losses or partial semantic losses.
Complete semantic losses may result from grammatical
losses when the ST meaning is distorted or improperly con-
veyed in the TT as a result of such a grammatical loss. Partial
semantic losses, on the contrary, may result from grammati-
cal losses when the ST primary meaning is conveyed, while
some other shades of meaning are lost in the TT due to such
a grammatical loss.
This study adopts Hervey and Higgins's (1992) percep-
tion of loss, in which they state that loss is "an important
corollary of this concept of translation loss is that it embraces
any failure to replicate a ST exactly, whether this involves
losing features in the TT or adding them" (p. 24). Thus, what
may be considered as gain by other theorists and scholars of
translation is not adopted in this study.
Objectives of the Study
This study aims to identify the grammatical losses in Abdel
Haleem's translation of Surah Al A'araf, and their contri-
bution to creating semantic losses. Following Hervey and
Higgins's (1992) definition of translation loss as failure to
replicate the ST exactly through omission or addition, gram-
matical losses refer to any improper use of grammar compo-
nents such as articles, prepositions, gender, aspect and tense,
plurality, and duality. The improper use can be in terms of
addition or deletion, which is likely to occur due to lack of
equivalence problem as highlighted by Baker (2011), or due
to the translator's failure to select the appropriate equivalent.
The study specifically aims at the following:
1. To identify the grammatical losses in Abdel Haleem's
translation of Surah Al A'araf
2. To identify the extent these grammatical losses con-
tribute to partial or complete semantic losses.
Literature Review
In his study of the lexical gap in the translation of the Quranic
verb, /kada/, Al-Utbi (2011) highlighted how the transla-
tion failed to find equivalents of the verb  due to the lexi-
cal gap (or grammatical gap) between the SL and the TL.
The investigated translations revealed mostly a change in
the word class of the Quranic verb to different word classes,
namely, adverbs, verbal constructions, and adjectives.
Largely, the translations of the Holy Quran are abundant with
examples that show grammatical gaps in translation. These
grammatical problems in translation may affect the meaning
intended in the ST.
In a study about the translation of the Quranic verb phrase,
Al-Ghazalli (2012) found that translators failed to accurately
render the verb phrase in the Quranic translation due to the
gap in grammatical structure or the inaccuracy in selecting
lexicons. For example, the following ayah shows such a loss
or inaccuracy in translation:




 

 

 


 


 





 


 


 





 




  


 




 


(49) 
 

 





 

 

 

 


And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh:
They set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons
and let your women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial
from your Lord. (Ali, 1938/1983, p. 249)
The derivative verb 





, which was translated as "slaugh-
tered" byAli, signifies the sense of abundantly doing the act of
Abdelaal and Md Rashid 3
slaughtering Jews' sons by Pharaoh's supporters. The transla-
tion of the ST verb, which is in the aorist tense and in the exag-
gerated form, as a past tense verb created a grammatical gap
that affected the meaning (Al-Ghazalli, 2012). Al- Ghazalli,
moreover, mentioned that such grammatical gaps make over-
translation unavoidable due the fact that the Quranic vocab-
ulary is pregnant with meaning, while there is syntactic and
lexical gap in the TL. He also indicated how derivative ger-
minated-by verbs were not accurately rendered because ger-
mination in Arabic is functional but it is not so in English;
for example, in translating the following ayah, the translator
failed to render the meaning accurately, as illustrated below:
(182) 



  

 
 





  


 




Those who reject Our signs, We will lead them step by step to
ruin while they know not. (Ali, 1938/1983, p. 173)
Asseenintheayahabove,thederivativeverb(i.e., 





 


)
indicates gradual change from a state to another. However, the
translation failed to convey such depth of meaning.
Another problem that is highlighted in some studies is the
nature of Arabic language, which permits foregrounding and
backgrounding, while English does not. In Arabic language,
in general, and in the Holy Quran in specific, style including
word ordering affects meaning (Abdelwali, 2007). The most
important information is usually foregrounded in Arabic, as
the syntactic style in Arabic usually allows such kind of fore-
grounding or backgrounding. Style in the Quranic language
is a principal component of meaning. However, translat-
ing the Holy Quran style is challenging due to the fact that
the Holy Quran has various styles, for example, narrative,
didactic, argumentative, and others (Sadiq, 2008). Most of
the English translations failed to convey the Quranic lex-
emes and styles (Abdelwali, 2007). The following example,
provided by Abdul-Raof (2004), indicates how style, which
actually is grammatical style, affects meaning in the Holy
Quran, and how translation fails to convey:
(14) 


 

 



 


 

 
 


   

 


Verily I am God; there is no god but I; therefore serve Me.
(Arberry, 1980, p. 340)
The example above shows how style was used through
the use of repetition to convey vividness of the Holy Quran
text though it may be regarded by nonnative speakers of
Arabic as redundant, with unnecessary use of pronouns.
For example, 


 /'innanii/, 
'/'ana/, and 
 /'anaa/, all
refer to Allah Almighty. This Quranic style, as Abdul-Raof
explained, serves two propositions: the first proposition is
related to Allah and His existence; the second proposition
is about Allah Almighty Oneness. In addition, the use of 
"fa" indicates immediate action without hesitation. These
entire stylistic features in the Quranic ayah are not conveyed
in the translation. However, they are a basic challenge for a
translator, and it can be hardly resolved because style is not
universal. In other words, each language has its own style
which cannot be followed in another language (Abdul-Raof,
2004). Abdul-Raof provided another example of ayah 67 in
Surah Taha, which reads:
(67( 


 


 


 
 




So Moses conceived is his mind a (sort of) fear. (Ali, 1938/1983,
p. 803)
As seen in the example above, the Quranic ST 


,
which is the subject, is backgrounded; however, in the trans-
lation, it was foregrounded to follow the English syntactic
pattern. This surly created a kind of loss in meaning. One
more example of foregrounding and backgrounding, and
how they are lost in translation is provided by Abdul-Raof
(2004) as follows:
(100  :(     
Yet they make the Jinns equals with God. (Ali, 1938/1983,
p. 319)
As seen above, the Quranic ST (), which is the
object of the clause, was backgrounded, and taken from its
post verbal position, whereas,  is foregrounded instead
of its initial position. Backgrounding and foregrounding
in the context of this ayah serve different communicative
purposes, such as disapproving what the unbelievers say,
bringing to the attention of the reader the notion of cal-
umny that the unbelievers attribute to God, condemning
the association of others with Allah Almighty, and keeping
the supreme status of Allah Almighty as Creator by fore-
grounding /li-llahi, and showing the ordinary status of
the Jinns who are themselves created by Allah Almighty
(Al-Qurtubi as cited in Abdul-Raof, 2004). All these pur-
poses were not communicated in the TT, as the translation
could not keep the same syntactic order of the authentic text
because of the linguistic limits of the English language, or
maybe because of the translator's lack of awareness of the
communicative function of foregrounding and background-
ing in the Quranic text.
Another example that indicates the failure of translation
to keep the same syntactic order of the ST (and background-
ing and foregrounding) is the one provided by Abdul-Raof
(2004):

/maa 'amilat

/maa 'amilat min suu'in/.
Another problem in translation can result from creating
stylistic ambiguities in translating some Quranic ayahs. For
example, Sadiq (2008) gave an example of stylistic ambigu-
ity in translating the following ayah from surah al-Dukhan,
(41  : ( "



 
 
 

 

 
 

 

  

"
The Day a patronizer will not avail any patronized thing. (Ghali)
Sadiq (2008) argued that translating 

/shayan/ as "any
patronized thing" is literal and syntactically vague; as the
word "patronized" in the translation describes "thing," not
the person. This translation is unclear because translating 
strikingly literally as "thing" created a kind of ambiguity.
Method
Research Design
This study fits in the interpretive paradigm of a qualitative
research. The qualitative research design is appropriate for
this study because the Holy Quran translation is complex,
and cannot be deeply investigated using other alternative
designs. As stated by Creswell and Clark (2007), a qualita-
tive research design is appropriate when a complex detailed
understanding of an issue is sought, and when quantitative
measurements and analyses do not fit the research problem.
Sampling of the Study
The data of the current study were extracted from Abdel
Haleem's English translation of Surah Al A'araf. One major
reason for selecting this surah is that it has not been exam-
ined in other studies; it also addresses principal issues for
every Muslim. It also provides rich data cases, as suggested
by Patton (2002). Six ayahs were chosen from the selected
Meccan Surah. As for the sample size, the number of ayahs
that were selected (i.e., six) was based on saturation, as in
any qualitative study, it is the researcher's responsibility
to identify the saturation point in his research (Creswell &
Miller, 2010).
Criteria for selecting Abdel Haleem's translation.Mohamed
Abdel Haleem's (2004) translation was selected for several
reasons. First, Abdel Haleem is an Arabic-speaking Muslim,
who masters both Arabic and English, as he has been liv-
ing in England since 1966 (Shah, 2010). In addition, he is
well versed in Islamic religion sciences, and his translation
manifests originality which is lacking in many other transla-
tions (Shah, 2010). Furthermore, his translation is a modern
translation that uses modern English.
Data Analysis
Inductive data analysis was followed in this study, as the
researcher is the person who interpreted the data based on his
prior knowledge and understanding. In the interpretive para-
digm, a researcher interprets the data based on his knowledge,
experience, and prior understandings (Creswell & Clark,
2007). Data analysis in the current study started concurrently
with the data collection process, as it is one characteristic of
qualitative inquiry is that data analysis is a simultaneous pro-
cess with data collection (Merriam, 2002). For the purpose
of this study, content analysis of the text was used. Content
analysis allows better and in-depth understanding of the phe-
nomenon under study (Downe-Wamboldt, 1992). Thus, the
grammatical losses were identified and analyzed based on
Catford' s (1965) translation shifts.
Results and Discussion
The analysis of the selected ayahs revealed frequent gram-
matical losses in the translation, which have mostly led
to partial semantic losses, while at other times, caused
complete semantic losses. For presentation of the results,
the Arabic Quranic ayah is 
provided in the first line(s),
transliteration is provided in the second line(s), and Abdel

Haleem's translation in the third line(s), followed by the
discussion of the results, which are fronted by brief mean-
ing of each ayah.
The ayah states the bounty of creation, as Allah is the
Creator of His creatures including Adam, Eve, and their off-
spring. The ayah also tells about the situation when angels
and Iblis were asked to do sujood or prostration to Adam.
Angels obeyed Allah Almighty and did sujood, while Iblis
refused such honor of obeying Allah Almighty.
Abdelaal and Md Rashid 5
Sample 1 illustrates grammatical losses in emphasis, con-
junctions, nominal agents and plurality. These losses are dis-
cussed in details in the subsections to follow.
Loss of Emphasis
Emphasis attawkid is one of the characteristics of the Arabic
language, which may differ in its forms. Sometimes, it occurs
through the use of repetition, synonyms or through the use
of certain words among others. One of these devices that is
used for emphasis is the letter lam  and the word


 (Al-
Samraai, 2006). They are used in the Holy Quran in a precise
way, and they are used in the 
appropriate context, when there
is a need for them (Al-Samraai, 2006).
As seen in Sample 1, the Quranic ayah (verse) begins
with the affirmative lexeme 


/Walaqad/, which is used
for emphasis purpose. However, 
this lexeme has been omit-
ted in Abdel Haleem's 
translation. In Sample 1, the ayah
talks about the creation of the human being, which is a great
and important thing, and thus confirmation and emphasis
are required (Al Baghawi, 1989; Al-Qurtubi, 2004). As it
is expected that if a human being knows that it is Allah
Almighty Who created him, he will believe in Him and
worship Him. The emphasis here is to draw the attention to
the basic and greatest bounty that Allah Almighty bestowed
on His creature, that is, creating them. However, 
the trans-
lation did not even compensate for such loss, as 
some-
times this is followed by some translators, and suggested
by many scholars (e.g., Newmark, 1988; As-Safi, 2012).
The translator opted to translate it by omission in Baker's
(2011) words. Although the primary meaning of the ST is
conveyed in the TT, omitting 
the emphasizing word surly
affects the conveyance of the meaning partially, that is, the
aesthetic feature of the ayah is not conveyed in the transla-
tion. Thus, this results in partial loss of meaning.
Loss in the Translation of Conjunction
As seen in Sample 1, the conjunction 
, which refers to
time lapse, or "succession at interval" (Catford, Darwin,
McCarus, Moray, & Snider, 1974), was 
omitted from the
translation of Abdel Haleem in its first occurrence in the
ayah. This omission created partial semantic loss because
the meaning of the ST conjunction was not conveyed in the
TT. The Quranic conjunction in the ST refers to the fact
that 
taking a certain appearance and shape took place after
a lapse of the time of the creation of Prophet Adam (Al
Baghawi, 1989). Some exegetes (e.g., Al Baghawi, 1989;
Al-Tabari, 2004) have mentioned that the first verb 
is used to refer to Adam, while the second verb 
refers to all the offspring of Adam. Following this interpre-
tation, the use of conjunction, therefore, is a necessity in
that it shows the time lapse, which is not conveyed in the
translation.
Another loss in translating conjunctions occurred in
translating  as "and not then," which 
caused partial seman-
tic loss, as the Quranic conjunctive letter indicates immedi-
ate action. Put simply, the ayah (Sample 1) refers to Allah
Almighty's command to angels to prostrate to Prophet
Adam, which was immediately obeyed. When angels were
demanded to prostrate or bow to Prophet Adam, they did it
immediately without hesitation. However, the use of "and"
in rendering the ST conjunction  does not convey such
meaning. This creates loss in the expressive meaning of the
ayah, that is, the immediate obedience to Allah Almighty by
doing sujood (prostration to Prophet Adam).
Similarly, the resumption  at the very beginning of
the ayah was omitted in the translation, which is another
instance of the loss in the translation of conjunctions due
to the omission of the ST conjunction in the TT. In this
sample, Abdel Haleem did not retain the conjunctions in the
translation, which is a kind of intra-system shift (Catford,
1965), as both the SL system and the TL system represent
conjunctions. However, the translator preferred to leave the
conjunctions out in his translation, which affects faithful-
ness to the ST.
Loss in Translating the Nominal Agent

Sample 1 also illustrates loss in translating the nominal
agent. As seen in Sample 1, the Quranic nominal agent
 was translated as 
"those who bowed down" by
Abdel Haleem, which is a level shift (Catford, 1965). Such
shift affects the meaning conveyed in the ST because the
nominal agent in the Arabic language serves as a descrip-
tive element that indicates constancy. In other 
words,
the nominal clause is used in this ayah to indicate Iblis's
refusal to be 
among those who prostrate, and thus to obey
Allah Almighty. 
This also creates partial semantic loss, as
the expressive meaning of the nominal agent was lost in
the translation.
Loss in the Translation of Plurality
Plurality is another problematic area that is challenging in
the translation. In Sample 1, the aforementioned shift, in
translating the Quranic nominal agent 
 as a verb (i.e.,
bow down), creates loss in plurality. Plurality in the Quranic
ayah indicates that many angels were doing sujood or pros-
tration to obey 
Allah Almighty, and follow His commands.

However, this plurality was not conveyed in the transla-
tion, which created a partial semantic loss, as the primary
meaning was conveyed, but the connotative meaning was
lost in the translation. The primary meaning that the angels
were doing sujood or prostration to obey 
Allah Almighty is
conveyed. However, the translation seems to have failed to
convey the connotative meaning of the ayah in the ST, that
is, the vast number of prostrating angels.
6 SAGE Open
The ayah describes how Allah ousted Iblis from Jannah
because of his obedience to Allah Almighty (by refusing to
do sujood to Adam). In the next subsection, the identified
grammatical losses are discussed.
Sample 2 illustrates grammatical losses in translating pro-
nouns, syntactic order, and verbs. These losses are discussed
in details in the subsections to follow.
Loss in Pronouns
As seen in the translation of Sample 2, the translator has
retained the implicit pro-drop subject 
pronoun into explicit
subject by using the word "God," which is not explicit in
the ST. 
Similarly, the object pronoun in the Quranic word
was translated as "here," which is an adverb, which indi-
cates a class shift from the object pronoun into the 
adver-
bial pronoun (Catford, 1965). However, the adverb "here"
may 
be ambiguous for a reader of the translation, as he may
not understand what the 
adverb refer to (which is Jannah).
Clarification could have been made using a footnote or even
by inserting 
the word "Jannah" between brackets.
In relation to this, one inherent characteristic of the Quranic
text is that pronouns which 
are not mentioned earlier in the ayah
or even in the Surah may be used, but they can be understood
from 
context and from intertextuality, that is, from the under-
standing of the whole Holy Quran. 
These pronouns are called
pro-drop pronouns, or implicit pronouns, which are similar to
the dropped English pronoun (you) in the imperative mood.
This characteristic of the Arabic language may cause confu-
sion for a translator, as he may be unsure whether to retain the
implicit pronoun explicit or just leave it implicit as it is. This is
similar to what Rasekh, Dastjerdi, and Bassir (2012) called as
"conscious ambiguity," in which they mentioned that retaining
the ambiguity is the TT is the right option in such kind of a
translation. In general, losses in translating pronouns are avoid-
able, and they can be reduced so as not to create semantic losses.
Loss in Syntactic Order
Another problem in translation is related to the syntactic
order. As seen in the translation of Sample 2, the subject
"God" precedes the verb "said" in the translation, which is
not the case in the ST. The 
Quranic text has the pro-drop
pronoun implicitly following the verb, which could not be
kept the same in the translated TT. However, this is a neces-
sity due to the norms of English language which does not
allow a verb to precede a subject. This loss in syntactic order
creates partial semantic loss in the translation, which affects
the expressive meaning (i.e., the aesthetic nature of the ST),
as the translation sounds redundant in fronting the subject
"God," which is pro-dropped in the ST.
These findings are consistent with the findings of Abdul-
Raof (2004) who showed that semantic loss sometimes occurs
due the inability of the translator of observing the syntactic order
of the ST. This could be either ascribed to the linguistic limits
of the English language, or to the translator's lack of realizing
of the communicative function of foregrounding and back-
grounding in the Quranic text. Similarly, Sadiq (2008) showed
that foregrounding and backgrounding are rarely followed by
translators. Keeping the same syntactic order of the ST in the
TT is one of the grammatical losses resulted sometimes from
the differences between the SL and TL. Syntactic order of a ST
can be hardly kept in the TT, especially when the SL and the
TL belong to different language families. Arabic is a language
which 
shows flexibility in the syntactic order. The subject,
compliment, or the verb can be 
foregrounded or backgrounded
based on the purpose and the importance of the 
foregrounded
or backgrounded lexical item. This characteristic of the Arabic
language is recurrent in the Holy Quran; 
it serves to highlight
the most important meaning. As Al-Samraai (2006) mentioned
in his book The Quranic 
Expression, there is no single word
that is foregrounded or backgrounded in the Holy Quran for no
purpose. 
The English language does not have such flexibility of
foregrounding and 
backgrounding, and thus the syntactic order
of the ST is lost in the translation. However, many other times,
syntactic losses have been created by the translator.
Loss of Verb in Translation
The Quranic sentence "
     
" was rendered in
the translation (in Sample 2) as "This is no place for your arro-
gance," which is a kind of categorical unit shift (Catford, 1965).
The verb 
"" in the ST could not be rendered into an equiva-
lent TT verb due to the lack of equivalent in the TT. In addi-
tion, the English noun "arrogance" does have a derived verb
form. The translation of the ST verb also reflects overtransla-
tion, as the word "place" is inserted in the translation, though
it 
does not exist in the ST. Literally, the Quranic sentence may
be translated as "you 
cannot be arrogant." This grammatical
loss in translating the ST verb affects the meaning partially,
as the ST verb, which is in aorist  /mudarAA/ in Arabic
expresses a present and stable action (Daryabadi, 2007); how-
ever, it was translated into a noun (i.e. arrogance), which does
not serve the same function as the verb. It also makes the trans-
lation less faithful to the ST This is, as Daryabadi (2007) high-
lighted, one of the translation problems in the Holy Quran. The
/mudarAA expresses present action and stable action,
which could not be rendered in the translation due to the dis-
crepancies between Arabic and English.

Abdelaal and Md Rashid 7
The ayah describes how Satan allured Adam and Eve and
urged them to eat from the forbidden tree in Jannah. He tried
to convince them that if they eat from the forbidden tree, they
will stay immortal in Jannah or become angels. As a result
of Adam and Eve's disobedience to Allah Almighty by eat-
ing from the forbidden tree, their privates were exposed. In
the next subsections, the identified grammatical losses are
explained.
Sample 3 illustrates grammatical losses in translating
conjunctions, duality order, syntactic order, and preposi-
tions. These losses are discussed in detail in the subsections
to follow.
Loss of Conjunctions
The Arabic conjunction  indicates immediate succession
(Ibn Hisham, 1998). However, in Sample 3, the Quranic con-
junction 
at the very beginning of the ayah has not been
rendered into the TT, which has created grammatical loss in
the translation of the conjunction due to the omission of the
conjunction. This affects the meaning partially, as some parts
of the ST meaning are not conveyed, that is, the immediate
whispering of Satan to Adam and Eve.
Also, the conjunctive 
in the Quranic context of   in
the same sample has not been translated by Abdel Haleem.
Instead, he has compensated it by 
using the colon (:), which is
an intra-system shift in Catford's (1965) words, or 
translation
by omission in Baker's (2011) words, whichdoes not seem to
affect the meaning. However, it affects faithfulness to the ST.
Loss of Duality
Arabic, unlike English, expresses duality in different gram-
matical forms. In contrast toArabic, English does not express
duality using fixed forms or pronouns. Thus, 
translators
translate second person duality into the second person pro-
noun, which is used in English for singular 
as well as plural
nouns. This type of translation is referred to by Catford as an
intra-system shift. The 
aforementioned sample (Sample 3)
shows eight examples of the loss in the 
translation of duality.
For example, the Quranic object pronoun 
"
" is rendered
as "them," and the object pronoun 
""is also translated as
"them." Likewise, the word 
is dual which, 
however, is
rendered into plural in the TT.This creates partial seman-
tic loss because the duality meaning is not conveyed in the
translation. Furthermore, if the ayah is read out of the con-
text of the whole Holy Surah, the meaning of duality will be
mistaken for plurality. This grammatical loss in the transla-
tion of duality could have been reduced through a compen-
sation strategy, such as adding "Adam and Eve" in brackets
after the TT word.
Loss of Syntactic Order
In Sample 3, the syntactic order of the ST   

is verb + 
object + subject. However, the same syntactic
order could not be preserved in the TT, which is "Satan
whispered to them" (subject + verb + object). This dif-
ferent syntactic order in the TT creates partial loss in
meaning, which cannot be avoided due to the linguistic
differences between the SL and the TL. This is because the
ST verb is foregrounded in the ST to highlight the action
of Satan. However, the rendered clause in the TT high-
lights the agent, which is "Satan.
Similarly, in translating "  ," the syntactic order
of the ST is not preserved, which affects its expressive mean-
ing, that is, highlighting the verb which indicates forbid-
ding. In the same way, the syntactic order is not preserved in
translating 

     . The word 
is foregrounded in the TT, which affects meaning 
because
backgrounding the Quranic word in the ST highlights the
blessing that Adam and Eve 
had enjoyed before committing
their sin, which is hiding their private parts.However, this
grammatical loss is recurrent in the translation between two
different languages such as English and Arabic; it is a kind
of categorical shift, in particular structural shift (Catford,
1965), which results in partial semantic loss.
Loss in Translating Prepositions
TheQuranicinthewordfunctionsas(AlBaghawi,
1989; Al-Qurtubi, 2004), which means the consequence. In
other words, as Al-Qurtubi (2004) mentioned in his tafsir, the
ayah implies that as a result of Adam and Eve's disobedience
to Allah Almighty, their private parts were exposed. However,
Abdel Haleem rendered the preposition as "so as to" in the TT,
which reflects a meaning that Satan whispered toAdam and Eve
to make their private parts exposed, which is inaccurate, and
thus a complete semantic loss in the translated TT.

voice will call out

The ayah describes the fact that when Adam and Eve
tasted the forbidden fruit in the forbidden tree, their private
parts became exposed, and thus they started to put leaves
from the trees of Jannah to cover their naked body. Then,
Allah Almighty called on them and reminded them that He
told them that they should not approach this tree, and that
Satan is their sworn enemy. In the next subsections, the iden-
tified grammatical losses are explained
Sample 4 illustrates grammatical losses in translating
conjunctions, syntactic order, duality and tense. These losses
are discussed in details in the subsections to follow.
Loss of Conjunctions
The conjunctive letter 
at the very beginning of the ayah
has not been translated, or translated by omission in Baker's

(2011) words. Similarly, 
the conjunction 
 in the ayah of 
, 
  and in 
  
has not been rendered in the
translation, which is a tendency inAbdel Haleem's translation.
This is an intra-system shift (Catford, 1965) because the SL
and the TL represent the conjunctions mentioned in the sam-
ple. However, the translator has opted to delete the conjunc-
tion in the TT, which has contributed to a partial semantic loss
because the Arabic conjunction implies the immediate action
taken by Satan to allure Adam and Eve, which has not been
conveyed in the translation.
Loss of Syntactic Order
As seen in Sample 4, the Quranic conditional sentence 





 




 

 


 

 is made up of two clauses in a specific order.
The first clause is 




 

 


 , while the second clause is 








 

. However, the translator could not preserve the syn-
tactic order of the ST, as the translator has 
foregrounded the
second clause, which creates a structural shift (Catford, 1965),
which affected the meaning of the TT partially. The ST high-
lights the reason of the exposure of Adam and Eve's private
parts, which is the disobedience to Allah Almighty, that is, eat-
ing from the forbidden tree. However, the translation highlights
the consequence of the disobedience of Allah Almighty, that is,
being naked, which affects meaning partially.
Loss of Duality
Similar to the loss of duality in Sample 3 that has been dis-
cussed in the aforementioned sample, in this sample, duality

is lost in the translation of the duality of words, such as 



and 





, which could not be rendered as dual in the TT
due the linguistic differences between Arabic and English.
However, this grammatical loss does not seem to affect the
meaning because the duality could be perceived out of the
context of the ayah. However, this type of grammatical loss
in translating duality affects faithfulness to the ST. In addi-
tion, it leaves some of the duality meaning out in the TT.
Examining carefully the ST and the TT, it is clear that the
meaning of duality in the ST is quite clear, which is not the
case in the TT.
Loss of Tense
As seen in Sample 4, the Quranic ST




 

 
 


 

 




is rendered as "Satan was your sworn enemy," resulting
in loss in tense. The Quranic clause has an implicit pro-drop

verb, that is, `is' in the present form. However, it is rendered
in the TT as past tense (i.e., was), which affects the meaning
conveyed in the TT. The TT 
past tense verb does not convey
the fact that Satan is still an enemy to Adam and his off-
spring. However, the ST present tense indicates that Satan
is not an enemy for Adam and Eve only, but for all their off-
spring as well. This ST meaning is not conveyed in the TT
due to the loss in tense.
The ayah describes how Allah Almighty will remove the
ill-feelings from the hearts of believers in Jannah, and how
the dwellers of Jannah will praise and thank Allah Almighty

for the great guidance Allah Almighty provided to them and
which made them inhabitants of Jannah. This guidance was
through sending prophets and messengers. Then, the ayah
ends with the great call that this great Jannah is inherited by
the believers due to their good deeds.
Sample 5 illustrates grammatical losses in translating
tense, conjunctions, and emphasis. These losses are dis-
cussed in details in the subsections to follow.
Loss in Tense
As seen in Sample 5, the Quranic verb 

, which is in the
present tense, is rendered by Abdel Haleem into the 
future
simple aspect (i.e., will flow) in the TT, which indicates a loss
in tense, particularly, the aorist tense. The Quranic ST verb,
which is in the present form, indicates a mental 
picture of riv-
ers as if they are running at the moment of reading the ayah,
but 
the rendered verb is in the future aspect form in the TT,
resulting in grammatical and semantic 
losses.Similarly, The
Quranic verb 
is also in the past tense form; however, it
is rendered into future simple aspect (will say).This actually
affects the expressive meaning, which is the fact that the past
ST verb indicates the absolute fact that the people of Jannah
will thankAllahAlmighty that they had been guided to Jannah.
Another double loss occurred in Sample 5 in the transla-
tion of 

, which is a past passive verb into as "a voice
will call out to them," which is a future active verb. The
first loss occurred via the translation of the 
passive voice
into active voice. This creates loss in translating the passive,
which 
serves certain purposes in the language of the Holy
Quran such as generalizability. In regard to the ST verb, it
is in the past passive form to indicate generalizability, as it
may be inferred from the ayah that the people of Jannah will
be called by angels or by Allah Almighty or by both, which
is rendered ambiguously in the TT. In addition, using active
voice instead of passive voice ambiguated the meaning and
made the TT less faithful to the ST. The second loss is by ren-
dering the past passive into the future present active voice.
In a similar vein, the Quranic clause 
  is in the
imperfect aspect of the verb. However, it has been 
translated
by Abdel Haleem as "on account of your deeds," which is a
class shift (Catford, 1965); 
however, it does not convey the
imperfect nature of the Quranic verb that expresses the 
past
and the present simultaneously.
Loss of Conjunction
The tendency of Abdel Haleem to drop conjunctions in the
TT is also reflected in the translation of Sample 5. The con-
junction  occurred in the ST sample 3 times. However, it
has been dropped in the translation, which creates a partial
semantic loss as some of the ST shades of meaning that are
expressed using the conjunction were not conveyed in the
TT, that is, the resumption function of the conjunction to
separate different statements or clauses.
Loss of Emphasis
In Sample 5, the emphatic word  is dropped from the trans-
lation in 



 



 


 


 

, which is an example of under-
translation. The Quranic word  serves to emphasize the
fact that the messengers of Allah Almighty informed people
about the truths of the Hereafter which they will find true on
the Day of Judgment. This fact will be spelled out by people
of Jannah on the Day of Judgment, when they see Jannah and
enter it. This grammatical loss of emphasis affects the mean-
ing partially because the emphasis that exists in the ST is lost
in the TT, without any sort of compensation.
The ayah describes the bounty ofAllahAlmighty by send-
ing winds that are laden with clouds. Then, these clouds are
driven to a dead and barren land to become revived, and the
plants start to grow. Then, the ayah ends with drawing anal-
ogy by reviving the dead land and Allah's Almighty ability to
resurrect the dead people on the Day of Judgment.
Sample 6 illustrates grammatical losses in translating pro-
nouns and adverbs. These losses are discussed in details in
the subsections to follow.
Loss in Translating Pronouns
As seen in Sample 6, the implicit pronoun that refers to Allah
Almighty has been rendered by Abdel Haleem 
into a noun
(i.e., God). Abdel 
Haleem's translation tends to be redundant
in rendering the pronoun as an explicit noun.This grammati-
cal loss may not affect the conveyance of the meaning of the
ST, but it affects the faithfulness to the ST, and it also affects
the aesthetic feature of the ST, which is accuracy, precise,
and lack of redundancy.
Loss in Translating Adverbs
In Sample 6, the Quranic word 

, which is an adverb, is
translated as a phrase "bearing good news." This is a unit shift

in Catford's (1965) words. This shift creates a grammatical
loss in the translation of the Quranic adverb, which describes
the winds as a source of bounties, 
and Allah Almighty's
mercy for His creatures. 
This grammatical loss conveyed
unfaithfulness to the ST, which seems to be unavoidable.
Conclusion
This article has focused on the investigation of the grammati-
cal loss in the translation of the Holy Quran, with special
reference to Surah Al A'araf, and the extent the different
types of grammatical losses cause partial or complete seman-
tic loss. The findings of the study revealed that losses occur
in the translation of conjunctions, syntactic order, duality,
tense, and verbs. It was also found that grammatical losses
contributed to semantic losses, which are mostly partial
semantic losses. In addition, some of these losses are avert-
able which could have been reduced. Thus, it is recom-
mended that future studies focus on the strategies of
translating the Holy Quran, and how losses can be reduced in
the translation of a sacred book, such as the Holy Quran.
