Twins are sometimes used as proxy informants but
little is known about reliability and validity of the
information thus obtained. The present study asks: (1)
to what extent do twin pairs agree with each other on
comparative ratings of health, psychosocial traits, and
environmental exposures?; and (2) how well do com-
parative ratings agree with usual self-reported
information about the exposures? Using 55 monozy-
gotic (MZ) and 71 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex pairs reared
together, percentage agreement was calculated for 44
comparative ratings. Pairs agreed on average about
half of the time. Agreement was higher for more dis-
crete exposures, such as smoking, but lower for more
subjective variables, such as the degree to which life is
experienced as stressful. Signed rank tests were used
to contrast comparative ratings to differences in self-
reports. Differences between twin partners in their
self-report indices, where available, were in the direc-
tion suggested by the comparative rating. Comparative
ratings appear most accurate for smoking and alcohol
use, and less consistent for mental health symptoms
and self-rated health.
Epidemiological studies often compare one twin's self-
reported behaviors and exposures to the twin partner's
in order to test whether or not the exposure is related
to a health outcome experienced differentially by the
twin pair. Less often used is an alternative technique
of comparative ratings, in which twins are asked if
they or their partner had greater exposure.
Comparative ratings have been used in twin studies
when absolute measures may be difficult to complete
retrospectively or when differential experiences are a
focus of study. Additionally, only one twin is some-
times available to provide data and comparative
ratings may be easier for proxy informants than
trying to estimate the exact extent of an exposure.
Although the comparative approach is very attractive,
little has been published using this approach.
The Sibling Inventory of Differential Experiences
(SIDE) was one of the first comparative measures used
among siblings (Baker & Daniels, 1990; Daniels &
Plomin, 1985) to examine sibling interaction, parental
treatment and peer characteristics. Agreement among
adult twins with respect to differences in parental treat-
ment and peer group characteristics was moderate
while agreement regarding sibling interaction was
poorer, particularly for twins who were 35 years and
older (Baker & Daniels, 1990).
Thomas Mack has established a comparative
approach for risk factors for breast cancers and multi-
ple sclerosis. As yet unpublished findings suggest that
twin agreement is higher for objective (e.g., age at
menarche, breast cancer) than for subjective (e.g.,
who had greater success) or depreciatory comparisons
(e.g., who had more trouble in school; T. Mack, per-
sonal communication, March, 2000). Finally, the
utility and reliability of twin comparative ratings has
been examined in a study on mosquito bites in adoles-
cent twins (Kirk et al., 2000). Findings indicated that
perceived twin differences in mosquito bite frequency
(`Compared with your twin who is bitten by mosqui-
toes more often?') were related to differences between
one twin's self-report and the twin partner's self-
report in the expected direction, suggesting that the
comparative rating was valid.
Relevant published findings on the use of proxy
information in a noncomparative format in a case-
control twin study of breast cancer (Hamilton &
Mack, 2000) indicate good to excellent reliability
between proxy and self-reports for several breast
cancer risk factors (e.g., ages at menarche and
menopause, oral contraceptive use, smoking), with
kappa statistics ranging from .60 to 1.0. Similarly, co-
twins have also been used as proxy informants for
smoking during pregnancy (Heath et al., 2003).
Generally good agreement between twins' retrospec-
tive reports of smoking during pregnancy was

observed in over 821 pregnancies (e.g., over 95%
agreement for never smoked regularly). However, pair
discrepancies did occur in nearly 11% of twins with a
history of smoking, and were interpreted as cases of
underreporting by the target twin. Such findings indi-
cate that we could expect good agreement for twins'
comparative ratings of health factors.
The purpose of the present study was to examine
(1) how well monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ)
twin pairs agree on comparative ratings relating to
putative dementia risk factors; and (2) how well com-
parative ratings agree with independent self-reported
information about the exposures.
Methods
Participants
Participants were selected from the third wave of in-
person testing (IPT3) from the Swedish Adoption/Twin
Study of Aging (Pedersen et al., 1991). The current
analyses included 52 MZ and 75 same-sex DZ twin
pairs reared together who both participated in IPT3.
One-hundred-and-forty individuals were female and
114 were male. The age range was between 40 and 77
years with a mean age of 59.6 years.
Measures
Twins were asked to complete a 44-item questionnaire
(see appendix), indicating for each item whether they
or their twin partner engaged in a particular behavior
to a greater extent, had greater exposure to variety of
environmental agents, or were in better or worse phys-
ical and psychological health. Responses of don't
know were set to missing. Nonreponse plus endorse-
ment of don't know accounted for between 3.94%
(which twin born first) and 47.14% (age at
menopause) of responses across items. Furthermore,
neither, equally or about the same were recoded into a
single category.
In this and prior waves of data collection, there
were survey questions asking for self-reports of various
exposures and health conditions. The corresponding
variables included: (a) use of cigarettes and alcohol; (b)
occupational and hobby exposures, such as livestock
slaughter or dressing wild game (including whether the
contact occurred as a youth or adult, and whether it
had occurred in the last three years or in multiple time
periods); (c) physical and psychological health such as
self-reported health, number of illnesses, depressive
symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies --
Depression total score; Radloff, 1977) and number of
life events (Holmes & Rahe, 1967; Persson, 1980). In
total there were 11 self-report indicators that could be
examined in the validity analyses of the comparative
ratings (with 2 self-report indicators for smoking,
alcohol use and stressful life events). For validity com-
parisons difference scores were created in the twins'
self-reports according to which twin was agreed upon
to have higher alcohol or tobacco consumption, partici-
pated more in handling livestock or game hunting, or
had worse physical or mental health. Next, the pair dif-
ference scores were compared to type and level of
agreement on the comparative measure. Each twin
pair's level of agreement on each item was coded as
follows: (1) twins who agreed that they differed were
expected to show the largest pair differences and were
coded as 1; (2) those pairs who responded either with
don't know or were nonresponders were coded as .5;
(3) those pairs who disagreed across any response cate-
gories were coded as ­.5; and (4) those endorsing
neither or equally as much were expected to show the
smallest differences and were coded as ­1.
Results
Agreement Between Twins in a Pair
MZ and DZ twins were compared with respect to
their agreement as to which twin was more exposed to
a particular element or experienced with a greater fre-
quency a specific physical or mental health symptom.
Table 1 shows for each comparative rating how many
pairs provided complete data and how well pairs
agreed. Kappa statistics were calculated using SAS 8.1
(SAS, 1999) both within each zygosity group and
overall. In order to estimate the kappa statistic in SAS
Proc Freq, it was necessary to ensure square cross-tab-
ulation tables for analysis as not all response
categories were endorsed for all items across pairs.
Thus, we followed the procedure of Crewsen (2001)
where dummy observations are created but do not
enter the computation of the kappa statistics. An
equality test indicates whether there are differences in
agreement by zygosity. Results of the equality tests
showed that kappa statistics did not differ signifi-
cantly by zygosity except for item 1 -- worse health
prior to age 20 -- where MZ pairs agreed more that
DZ pairs. MZ pairs retained larger kappa statistics
than DZ pairs for 19 of 44 items, while DZ pairs
exhibited higher kappa statistics for 22 of 44 items.
The average overall kappa was .40. Agreement was
highest for overt exposures or traits, such as weight
(kappa = .68), smoking/drinking (kappa = .64 to .77)
and wild game exposure (kappa = .61). More subjec-
tive or concealed traits such as headache frequency
(kappa = .48), stress (kappa = .33) and finding one's
way in unfamiliar places (kappa = .25) often showed
considerably less agreement between twins. There was
a pattern of greater agreement for more recent expo-
sures than earlier exposures: (a) worse health prior to
the age of 20 years (kappa = .31) is nearly the same as
for worse health between 20 to 40 years (kappa =
.27), but both were lower than worse health after the
age of 40 years (kappa = .45); (b) agreement was
lower for total number of operations with anesthesia
(kappa = .27) compared to the last 3 years (kappa =
.40) but with overlapping confidence intervals.
In comparing kappa statistics across items, the
underlying assumption that proportions for each
response category are the same (i.e., similar proportions
endorse me, my twin, and equally as much/neither) may

be untenable. Examining this assumption revealed
several response patterns. First, twins reported being
the same for many of the traits/exposures. The median
percentage agreement of sameness (response of equally
as much or neither) for MZ and DZ pairs is 58% and
41% respectively, but ranges widely across traits (MZ
range 0% to 93%; DZ range 0% to 94%). The median
percentage of twin pairs who disagreed whether they
were the same was 19% and 26% for MZ and DZ
pairs respectively (MZ range 0 to 42%; DZ range 0 to
52%). Second, there was a small tendency toward self-
endorsement such that twins chose me over my twin a
median of 56% of the time when ignoring endorsement
of equally as much or neither (range 34% to 79%).
Chi-square tests of significance, ignoring twin-pair
status, indicated that 12 out of 44 items deviated signif-
icantly from equal endorsement of me versus my twin,
of which 10 items showed a bias toward self-endorse-

ment (e.g., `Who had more operations using anesthe-
sia?'; `Who had the worst concussion?'; `Who had more
stress in his or her life?'; `Which of you had the earlier
age of menopause?') while only two items showed a
significant preponderance of choosing the co-twin over
one's self: `Just in the past three years, who had worse
physical health?', and `Which of you has had more
serious times of feeling depressed?'
Agreement Between Comparative
and Self-Report Information
Table 2 presents results comparing twins' self-reports
to comparative ratings for pairs agreeing that one
twin was higher than the other (i.e., pairs were con-
sistent in choosing one member as having greater
exposure). Signed rank tests, calculated using the
SAS univariate procedure (SAS, 1999), were used to
contrast comparative ratings to differences between
one twin's self-report and the twin partner's self-
report on the corresponding variable. The validity of
comparative ratings was quite good, as indicated by
significant signed rank test results. The response dif-
ferences were in the direction that was to be
expected: twins who were rated by both themselves
and their co-twin as experiencing more exposure or
higher incidence of physical and mental health vari-
ables, also had greater self-report values for these
measures. Signed rank tests were significant for all
variables with the exception of `Life Events' (p = .39)
and `Uncontrollable Life Events' (p = .12).
Responses from twins where only one had provided
a comparative rating (limited to endorsing me or my
twin) but both twins had supplied self-report were also
examined. The number of pairs for each trait ranged
from 0 (dress wild game, livestock slaughter) to 17
(depressive symptoms and uncontrollable life events).
The traits on which agreement between comparative
rating and self-report responses was highest were the
two smoking variables (where agreement was perfect
but data were only available for four pairs), followed
by the two alcohol variables (where level of agreement
was similar to Table 2). Agreement for depressive
symptoms and uncontrollable life events was quite poor
with trends in the opposing direction: a greater number
of pairs with self-report differences inconsistent than
consistent with the comparative report.
To examine the question of validity among all
available pairs, the relationships between absolute pair
differences in self-report measures with level of pair
agreement were examined based upon a pair's joint
response to comparative ratings and coded as ­1, ­.5,
.5 and 1, as described above. Spearman correlation
coefficients served as effect size estimates between
level of agreement and absolute pair differences in
self-report variables tapping a relevant exposure (see
Table 3). A positive correlation suggests that greater
pair differences on self-report traits are associated
with level of agreement regarding twin dissimilarity.
Spearman correlations ranged from ­.07 to .81 with a
median correlation of .27. Similar to the focused look
at pairs who agree that they differed, the strength of
the association between pair differences and level of
agreement across all comparative response categories
was notably higher for substance use or hobbies than

for less observable traits. By zygosity, the median
Spearman correlations were .21 and .26 for MZ and
DZ pairs, respectively. The relatively smaller correla-
tions for MZ pairs may reflect a greater likelihood for
MZ pairs to disagree than DZ pairs due to smaller
pair differences.
Discussion
Comparative ratings of risk factors are sometimes
used in twin studies, particularly when only one twin
might be available to provide information, for
example, if the other twin is ill or demented. The
present study addressed the reliability and validity of
such ratings. Results suggested that comparative
ratings of risk factors are useful for observable and
objective behaviors, though some caution is warranted
for subjective internal states. However, where twins do
agree that exposure or experiential differences exist
there is a high validity with self-reports.
Our findings on the validity of comparative ratings
relative to self-report data converge with direct tests of
the validity of proxy responses by co-twins for smoking
during pregnancy (Heath et al., 2003), as well general
smoking traits (Hamilton & Mack, 2000). Kappa sta-
tistics are lower for ages at menarche and menopause
than those reported by Hamilton & Mack (2000), but
were very similar for amount smoked.
Some caution is warranted in relying on proxy
responders for potentially derogatory traits (i.e.,
drinking problems, depression) as twins may show a
tendency to promote their co-twin as having greater
problems. The bias to report the co-twin as having
more trouble with depression may have played some
role in the results for singletons, for example, where
only 2 of the 17 singletons reported that they had
more trouble with depression than their co-twin.
These analyses represent an extension of the com-
parative rating methodology to older cognitively intact
individuals. In this older sample we find that there is
generally better agreement for more recent exposures
than earlier exposures (e.g., worse health in past three
years versus worse health earlier in life). Given a
closer proximity in time for early life events, younger
individuals may show better agreement.
In conclusion, comparative ratings can be used for
objective attributes: twins do agree. Moreover, there
appears to be no appreciable bias by zygosity. MZ and
DZ twins do not significantly differ in agreement and
only small differences were apparent in validity analy-
ses. However, the overall level of agreement is less
than desirable, especially for more subjective traits.
Furthermore, the most used response choice is don't
know. Finally, twins often say they are the same.
Future studies ought to consider differing rating scale
formats with more choices to examine whether such
response tendencies could be altered and the compara-
tive approach made more useful.
