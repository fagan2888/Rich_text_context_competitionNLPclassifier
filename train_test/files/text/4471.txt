Introduction
The offshore floating devices have attracted interest due to
the higher levels of annual average incident wave power
that occur in deep water and the minimal topographical con-
straints for their deployment. An area that has not received
much focus is the seabed mounted nearshore devices, where
nearshore is defined as having a water depth between 10 and
20
m and is typically located at a distance of 0.5­2.0
km
from the coastline. This may be due to fact that the nearshore
has a lower annual average incident wave power as com-
pared to offshore, even though the exploitable resource is
often only 5%­10% less. Even though a nearshore site has a
lower average incident wave power, it possesses a number
of attractive characteristics.Anearshore location will reduce
both the costs and power losses in the cable, which brings
power back to the shore. A nearshore location will reduce
the costs of installation and maintenance and also increase
the plant availability by utilizing smaller weather windows
for repair and maintenance. The operations and maintenance
costs account for perhaps 40% of the net present cost of a
wave energy converter (WEC) (Henry et al., 2010). Hence,
this is a significant issue. Moreover, shallow water filters
out the largest waves, potentially reducing the maximum
loads required for survival, although placement within the
wave breaking zone may negate this advantage and can
even cause the maximum loads to increase. Balancing the
costs, benefits and the available resource, it is possible to
determine the ideal water depth for the installation of a wave
energy device at a specific location.
In order to assess the finite depth effects, one needs to con-
sider two aspects. First, the limited water depth wave spectrum
has to be represented correctly. The existing parametric wave
spectra have been derived for deep water; however, the wave
characteristics are modified as they approach shallow water.
Second, wave climatology database exists for many coastal
areas, but typically they are obtained from measurements with
floaters located at depths greater than 70m.Therefore, it is nec-
essary to transform the wave climatology scatter diagram from
deep to shallow water depths as shown in Bouws et al. (1985).
Shallow water effects on wave
energy converters with hydraulic
power take-off system
Ashank Sinha, D Karmakar and C Guedes Soares
Abstract
The effect of water depth on the power absorption by a single heaving point absorber wave energy converter, attached
to a hydraulic power take-off system, is simulated and analysed. The wave energy flux for changing water depths is
presented and the study is carried out at a location in the north-west Portuguese coast, favourable for wave power
generation. This analysis is based on a procedure to modify the wave spectrum as the water depth reduces, namely,
the TMA spectrum (Transformation spectrum). The present study deals with the effect of water depth on the spectral
shape and significant wave heights. The reactive control strategy, which includes an external damping coefficient and a
negative spring term, is used to maximize power absorption by the wave energy converter. The presented work can be
used for making decisions regarding the best water depth for the installation of point absorber wave energy converters
in the Portuguese nearshore.

The preliminary objective of the present work is to
obtain a general overview of the wave power resource
(wave power flux) reduction as the water depth reduces
and then to determine the reduction in wave power
extracted by a single floater WEC. The latter aspect is
interesting since, on one hand, it is expected that the larg-
est reduction of the resource occurs for the higher sea
states, but on the other hand, the power production of
WECs is usually limited, which means that above a spe-
cific value of the wave height, the converted power does
not increase. For this reason, it might happen that the
reduction of wave power flux is not so important for the
annual energy production. This procedure gives the possi-
bility to understand what might be the best operational
location for a WEC at an early design stage.
With the above-mentioned objectives in mind, it makes
sense to use a robust, simple and general method to repre-
sent the modification of the wave spectrum as the water
depth reduces. The method has been proposed by Bouws
et al. (1985) and has an additional advantage of representing
average bottom topography conditions. In Guedes Soares
and Caires (1995), the transformation of the offshore wave
spectra to a finite depth site, using a model for spectral wave
energy transfer, has been presented. This spectrum shape,
named TMA, is a transformation of the Joint North Sea
Wave Project (JONSWAP) offshore spectra and is consid-
ered in the present study as the most realistic spectrum to
point out the loss of energy resource and power production
when moving from deep water to shallow waters.
In the present study, a single floater WEC having a
cone-cylinder shape as in Sinha et al. (2015b) is used as an
example to quantify the loss in extracted wave power with
reduction in water depth. The floater is coupled with a
hydraulic power take-off (PTO) system to extract wave
power. A second-order approximation model is used to
represent the PTO system, with a limitation on the PTO
bandwidth and the control forces. For point absorbers, it is
well known that the appropriate control of the applied PTO
forces can potentially increase the amount of energy
extracted from sea waves. Hence, reactive control strategy
has been used to maximize the power extraction, which is
represented by an external damping coefficient and a nega-
tive spring term.
Finite depth spectral model
There are many wave spectra used for offshore waves in
deep water, that is, when the wavelength is larger than
twice the water depth. A fundamental spectrum is the
Pierson­Moskowitz spectrum, which describes the wave
spectra for fully developed sea or fully arisen sea (FAS),
when a constant wind blowing infinitely long cannot
increase the energy in the waves, but the energy transfer is
balanced by dissipation. This spectrum is a one parameter
spectrum completely described by the wind speed given by

the wind speed at the height
19.5m above still water level. Mostly, the sea state is not
fully developed as the wind speed and direction change,
the fetch is too short or the wind duration is not long
enough, especially for strong winds and high waves
(Bergdahl, 2009). The two-parameter spectra for devel-
oping seas can be used where the wave height and fre-
quency are the known parameters. This was originally
proposed by Bredtschneider and offers more flexibility
because the energy of the spectra can be placed at arbi-
trary locations on the frequency axis with the correspond-
ing significant wave height. Such spectra belonging to
the PM family are also, somewhat incorrectly, referred to
as PM spectra (Pierson and Moskowitz, 1964). The
widely used spectra are the International Ship Structures
Congress (ISSC, 1964) spectra.
The two-parameter spectrum still gives too little free-
dom to reproduce realistic spectra of the developing sea.
In 1973, Hasselmann published the five-parameter
JONSWAP spectrum, which was one of the results from
the JONSWAP

parameters  and

of the PM spectrum also need to be
chosen.
The JONSWAP spectrum is in common use for design
of drilling platforms in the offshore industry because it
offers more flexibility with its five parameters, and can
produce realistic spectra. The parameters are then chosen
from wave statistics combined with systematic parameter
fitting. While the JONSWAP spectrum was originally
developed for developing sea in deep water. However, the
waves in shallow areas are often waves coming in from
deeper areas into an area where they are affected by the
limited water depth. For such cases, the modified
JONSWAP spectrum in shallow water called the TMA
spectrum (Transformation spectrum) is used as in Hughes
(1977). It is based on the fact that low-frequency or equiv-
alently long-period waves must have a limited height in
shallow water. Therefore, the expression for the TMA
spectrum is obtained by multiplying the expression for the
JONSWAP spectrum with a limited depth function

depth function

Numerical modelling
The equation of motion of an oscillating point absorber in
heave can be described by Newton's second law as
mz F F F F

,
(5)
where m is the mass of the floater, 
z the floater accelera-
tion, Fex
the exciting wave force, Frad
the radiation force.
The radiation force can be decomposed with linear theory
into a linear added mass term and a linear hydrodynamic
damping term as
F m z b z

( ) ( )
 
  (6)
The hydrostatic restoring force Fres
is the buoyancy
force Fb
minus the gravity force Fg
. This force corre-
sponds to the spring force with a linear spring constant k
and is expressed as
F F F V t mg kz
res arch g

 ( ) (7)
where  is the water density, g the acceleration due to
gravity, V t
( ) the instantaneous submerged floater volume.
The spring constant or hydrostatic restoring coefficient k
is given by
k gAw

where Aw
is the waterline area.
FPTO reactive
,
is the force exerted by the PTO to control
the movement of the floater and is expressed as
F k z b z
PTO reactive PTO PTO

The coefficients kPTO
and bPTO
are the optimal coef-
ficients maximizing the average absorbed power by the
floater, where kPTO
is a negative spring term and bPTO
a positive external damping coefficient. The coeffi-
cients kPTO
and bPTO
are not real physical quantities but
control parameters. Hence FPTO reactive
,
is generated as a
linear feedback from measurements of the floater move-
ment. This is a causal implementation of the reactive
control, as the parameters are not changed wave-to-
wave but tuned according to the current sea state. The
maximum absorption of ocean energy is achieved when
the velocity of the point absorber is in phase with the
incident wave force. However, the frequency of the
ocean waves varies, the condition of maximal absorp-
tion is not automatically fulfilled and a control strategy
is therefore necessary. If the energy only flows from the
ocean to the electrical grid, the control strategy is typi-
cally referred to as resistive or passive. On the other
hand, if the energy flow is bi-directional, the control
strategy is referred to as reactive control (Sinha et al.,
2015a).
Taking into account all the considerations, the equation
of motion of a heaving point absorber, coupled with a PTO
mechanism able to perform reactive control, can be re-
written as

Hydraulic PTO
The hydraulic PTO system used in the present study is based
on a hydrostatic transmission principle, which is quite
analogous to the system suggested for Salter's Duck as
in Salter (1974). An illustration of the PTO is presented in
Figure 2. This system consists of a symmetric cylinder oper-
ated in closed-circuit with a swash-plate variable displace-
ment axial-piston pump/motor powering a generator. The
bi-directional flow is converted to a uni-directional rotation
by the closed-circuit pump/motor capable of both positive
and negative swash-plate angles. This study does not cover
the dynamic modelling and design of the internal control
loops of the PTO. Instead, a second-order approximation of
the closed loop behaviour of the cylinder-force is used as in
Sinha et al. (2015a), with a PTO bandwidth of 6rad/s and a
damping factor of 0.6. The cylinder is limited to give a max-
imum significant force of 200kN.
Case study
Aguçadoura wave climate scatter diagram is chosen to
analyse the finite depth effects on the energy resource and
capture. Aguçadoura located near Póvoa de Varzim north
of Porto in Portugal is an important testing and demon-
strating area for WECs. The Aguçadoura wave farm was
the world's first wave farm designed to use the three
Pelamis WECs to convert the motion of the ocean surface
waves into electricity. It is located 5km offshore.
The plotted scatter diagram shown in Figure 3 is a result
of statistical analysis and was generated using 3-hour con-
secutive significant wave height and wave period time
sequences, resulting from simulations with the Simulating
Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model for the entire time inter-
val (2009­2011) as in Silva et al. (2013). The scatter dia-
grams shown in Figure 3 have been obtained for three
different water depths of 79, 58 and 20
m, respectively. In
the scatter diagram, for Hs
= 0 5
. m, the values less than
0.5m and for Hs
=1m, values>0.5m and 1m were taken
into account and so on. The same is also valid for Tp
.The
values shown in green-yellow are the probabilities of occur-
rences of different sea states expressed in percentages of the
total number of occurrences. The sea states were structured

Results and discussion
Effect of water depth on the spectrum
The transformation effect on the spectral shape is plotted
in Figure 4 for peak period of 13s. It can be seen that the
peak of the spectrum reduces with decrease in water depth.
The graph shows a significant reduction of sea state vari-
ance as the water depth reduces to 58 and 20m.
Effect of water depth on significant wave height
Figure 5 illustrates the effect of water depth on the signifi-
cant wave height for different peak periods of the scatter dia-
gram. The study shows that the significant wave height
reduces as the water depth decreases and the result is normal-
ized by the deep water value Hs deep
,
. The significant wave
heights are calculated using zero order spectral moments.
Effect of water depth on the scatter diagram
Due to water depth decrement, the sea states having the
highest significant wave height are less probable, and on
the other hand, the probability of occurrence of the sea

112 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 7(3)
states having lower heights is increased with limited water
depth. This is the main characteristic that stands out from
the three scatter diagrams as shown in Figure 3 ­ the
classes of higher significant wave height Hs
decrease
their probability, and those of lower Hs
increase their
probability, as water depth decreases. This aspect may be
interesting for WECs, since usually the PTO system is lim-
ited in terms of nominal power and therefore the system
will not use the full wave energy power resource of the
largest sea states. The water depth effect on the probability
distribution of the significant wave heights is plotted in
Figure 6. The probability is more concentrated around the
lower significant wave heights between 1 and 2m.
Effect of water depth on the wave power
resource
Once the new spectral shapes are calculated, it is possible
to compute the effect of change in water depth on the
available power resource. The available wave power

It can be seen from Table 1 that more than 50% of the
available wave power is lost as the water depth changes
from 79 to 20
m and around 10% is lost at 59
m depth.
Hence, there is a significant reduction in the wave power
resource when water depth reduces. The result is quite
similar to the one obtained in Folley et al. (2006).
Effect of water depth on power absorption
The final step is to study the effect of water depth on the
wave power extracted by a heaving point absorber WEC
coupled with a hydraulic PTO. The power matrices for dif-
ferent water depths are presented in Figure 7. The control
parameters bPTO
and kPTO
, which are shown in Figures 6
and 7, respectively, have been optimized for each sea state
in the scatter diagram to give the corresponding maximum
value of extracted power.
From the power matrix in Figure 7, it can be seen that
there is a considerable reduction in absorbed power as we
move from deep to shallow water, especially for the sea
states with longer periods. The values in Figure 7 move
from smaller green to moderate yellow and to larger red
values. Also, it can be observed that the maximum
absorbed power is distributed around different peak peri-
ods for different water depths. This affirms the impor-
tance of considering the scatter diagram for the correct
water depth when designing and fine tuning the WEC. It
is seen from Table 2 that around 50% less wave power is
extracted at a water depth of 20m than at 79m. This is a
significant reduction in extracted power. The power
absorption reduces by around 7% on moving to a depth of
58m.
The optimized values in the bPTO
and kPTO
matrices
move from smaller green to larger yellow values. From

Figure 8, it is observed that there is a considerable differ-
ence in values as we move from deep to shallow water,
especially for sea states with longer periods. For the
water depth of 20m, the optimal bPTO
values are the least
as compared to other water depths. In Figure 9, the values

; the actual values
are just the negative of the ones shown in the matrix.

Conclusion
The present study uses a simplified method to represent
the wave spectrum modification as the water depth reduces,
namely, the TMA method. Moreover, the effect on wave
power resource as well as on the power absorbed by a
heaving point absorber WEC is presented. Most of the
recently proposed WECs are planned to be installed in
relatively shallow water depths where the wave energy
resource is reduced compared to deep water. This case
study uses the annual wave statistics from Aguçadoura,
located at north-west coast of Portugal. The scatter dia-
gram representing the annual wave statistics modifies sig-
nificantly as the water depth reduces from 79 to 58m and
Figure 8. bPTO

to 20
m. Moreover, the significant wave height reduces
with decrease in water depth. The consequence is that the
annual wave power resource reduces by about 11% at 58m
and 55% at 20m, on moving from a water depth of 79m.
The reactive control strategy is implemented, with optimal
control parameters bPTO
and kPTO
maximizing the
extracted wave power. The power matrices are determined
for each water depth and it is found that the absorbed
power reduces by 7% at 58m and by 50% at 20m, as com-
pared to 79
m depth. There is considerable reduction in
absorbed power for sea states with longer periods and the
maximum power is distributed around different peak peri-
ods for different depths. The present study can be useful
for a preliminary cost­benefit analysis of the most con-
venient depth to install a floating point absorber WEC.
