Abstract
Background: A consequence of the widespread uptake of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is that the older South
African population will experience an increase in life expectancy, increasing their risk for cardiometabolic diseases
(CMD), and its risk factors. The long-term interactions between HIV infection, treatment, and CMD remain to be
elucidated in the African population. The HAALSI cohort was established to investigate the impact of these
interactions on CMD morbidity and mortality among middle-aged and older adults.
Methods: We recruited randomly selected adults aged 40 or older residing in the rural Agincourt sub-district in
Mpumalanga Province. In-person interviews were conducted to collect baseline household and socioeconomic
data, self-reported health, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
HbA1c, HIV-status, and point-of-care glucose and lipid levels.
Results: Five thousand fifty nine persons (46.4% male) were enrolled with a mean age of 61.7 ± 13.06 years. Waist-
to-hip ratio was high for men and women (0.92 ± 0.08 vs. 0.89 ± 0.08), with 70% of women and 44% of men being
overweight or obese. Blood pressure was similar for men and women with a combined hypertension prevalence of
58.4% and statistically significant increases were observed with increasing age. High total cholesterol prevalence in
women was twice that observed for men (8.5 vs. 4.1%). The prevalence of self-reported CMD conditions was higher
among women, except for myocardial infarction, and women had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of
angina (10.82 vs. 6.97%) using Rose Criteria. The HIV- persons were significantly more likely to have hypertension,
diabetes, or be overweight or obese than HIV+ persons. Approximately 56% of the cohort had at least 2 measured
or self-reported clinical co-morbidities, with HIV+ persons having a consistently lower prevalence of co-morbidities
compared to those without HIV. Absolute 10-year risk cardiovascular risk scores ranged from 7.7­9.7% for women
and from 12.5­15.3% for men, depending on the risk score equations used.

Conclusions: This cohort has high CMD risk based on both traditional risk factors and novel markers like hsCRP.
Longitudinal follow-up of the cohort will allow us to determine the long-term impact of increased lifespan in a
population with both high HIV infection and CMD risk.

Background
At a global level, growth in the proportion of adults aged
65 and older is outpacing the proportion of younger
adults for the first time [1]. As a result, chronic diseases,
including cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), have become
a major burden of disease and related mortality in low-
resource settings, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
[2­4]. From the late 1990s to 2011, non-communicable
disease mortality increased steadily [3] in adults 50 years
and above, due largely to an increase in a number of risk
factors such as hypertension, increased smoking preva-
lence, dietary changes and obesity [5]. These risks factors
have been followed by increases in symptomatic cardio-
vascular conditions such as stroke, ischemic heart dis-
ease and diabetes, for which health policymakers have
yet to evolve an effective response.
These trends are prominent despite the pervasive ef-
fects of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired im-
mune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Further, it is
increasingly recognized that human populations in sub-
Saharan Africa, but especially in South Africa, in spite of
a previous profound drop in life expectancy, are now
aging rapidly. This demographic transition is the result of
falling mortality rates, due in part to widespread uptake of
anti-retroviral therapy (ART), coupled with marked de-
creases in fertility in recent decades [1, 6, 7]. National
leaders, health and social systems, and the accompanying
policy processes--still contending with an "unfinished
agenda" of widespread infection and excess maternal,
infant and childhood illness--are poorly prepared for
the scale and speed of the demographic change that
is underway [8].
The transition is complex, with a non-linear trajectory,
reflected in the `collision' between non-communicable
and infectious disease [9]. Widespread uptake of ART
for HIV has led to a profound improvement in mortality
trends at all ages [10]. While ART extends the lifespan of
people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), it does not come
without costs. Compared to PLWHA who were not on
ART, those on ART have been shown to have an increased
prevalence of dyslipidemia [6, 11, 12]. Biomarkers for in-
flammation, e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), have also been
identified as potential useful markers for assessing in-
creased risk of CMD in HIV-infected persons, though the
evidence is mixed [7, 13­15]. The long-term effect of the
complex interaction between epidemic infectious disease
and CMD in these environments is simply not known and
will require prospective follow-up of population-based co-
horts to answer this question.
The shifting factors that have led to the increase in
CMD in South Africa are certainly exerting pressure to
act, but public sector policymakers and programmers
face a critical barrier: a lack of population-based data
with which to understand the multiple effects and deter-
minants of the ongoing transition, specifically with regard
to CMD. In 2015 as part of the Health and Aging in
Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community
(HAALSI) in South Africa, we completed the baseline
wave of data collection in a cohort of 5,059 men and
women 40 years of age drawn from the Agincourt Health
and socio-Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) which
covers the Agincourt sub-district of Mpumalanga Province
in a border region of rural South Africa adjacent to south-
ern Mozambique [16]. The overall objective of HAALSI
with regard to CMD is to understand the major forces
shaping the trajectory of the prevalence, incidence, and risk
factors of CMD in this cohort of 5,059 individuals. In this
particular study, we sought to assess the prevalence of
CMD risk factors and symptomatic CMDs and to measure
the 10-year CMD risk in a large rural South African popu-
lation. Second, we sought to compare these variables across
genders and HIV status.
Methods
The HAALSI study is based in the Agincourt HDSS site,
a sub-district of rural Mpumalanga Province comprising
some 116,000 people living in 19,000 households and
31 villages in an area of ~450 km2. An annual census
update, conducted by experienced local field staff, pro-
vides up-to-date denominator data on the full population
with systematic recording of all vital events (deaths, births,
in- / out-migrations).
Eligibility
All adults aged 40 years and older as of July 1, 2014,
who had permanently resided in the Agincourt sub-
district of Mpumalanga Province for at least one year
prior to the 2013 census update, were eligible.
Sampling and sample size
A total of 6,281 persons were selected for recruitment. To
maximize the linkages with previous HIV and NCD studies

in Agincourt, those who participated in earlier studies and
met the eligibility criteria were selected with 100 percent
probability. The remainder of the sample was selected ran-
domly from the 2013 census HDSS database, stratifying on
sex in order to achieve equal numbers of women and men.
Recruitment
Prior to the survey, the HAALSI study was introduced to
community members across the study villages, and dis-
cussed in-depth with a representative Community Advisory
Group. This facilitated community review of study objec-
tives and contributed to the effective response achieved.
The entire population identifies itself as "African".
Between November 2014 and November 2015 all se-
lected individuals were visited at home by a supervised
local field worker who briefly described the study in the
local language (Shangaan), and requested permission to
explain the relevant informed consent forms. A signed
consent form was obtained from those who agreed to
participate. Field workers also signed and dated the in-
formed consent form.
Data collection
Interviews lasting 2­3 hours were conducted at partici-
pants' households. The visit included a questionnaire in
two parts: household and socioeconomic data then indi-
vidual interview data, which included anthropometric,
physical and cognitive function assessments plus blood
sample collection in the form of a capillary blood sample
or "dried blood spots" (DBS). Data were captured on
laptop computers using a Computer Assisted Personal
Interview (CAPI) program. All self-reported conditions
were captured using the question "Have you ever been
told by a doctor, nurse, or other healthcare worker that
you have (condition)?" Physical data collected included
blood pressure (Omron M6W® automated cuff), weight
(Genesis Growth Management Electronic Scale®); height
using a height sensor with infrared measurement; waist
and hip circumferences with a flexible tape measure
(SECA®). The DBS were analyzed for high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (hsCRP), HIV-status, viral load, nu-
cleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors among the
HIV+ (1­3 drops), and presence of the anti-retroviral
drugs (ART) emtricitabine or lamivudine for persons
with a positive HIV antibody test. The Division of
Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory at the University of
Cape Town (UCT), South Africa performed the test-
ing for the presence of ART. Additional blood sam-
ples were used in point-of-care machines to measure
glucose (Caresens© N Monitor), and individual lipid levels
(Cardiochek© PA Silver version. Three blood pressure
readings (systolic and diastolic) were obtained with 2 mi-
nutes between each reading.
Assessment of CVD risk factors and HIV status and
diagnosis of CMDs
Age stratification follows the South African National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES)
categorization [17]. Body Mass Index (BMI; kg/m2)
categorization uses World Health Organization (WHO)
obesity cutoffs [18] and waist-to-hip ratios (WHR) were
considered high if > 0.90 for men, and > 0.85 for women
[19]. The mean blood pressure was calculated using the
average between the second and third readings [20].
Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pres-
sure 140 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure 
90 mmHg or controlled blood pressure with self-reported
use of taking hypertensive medication [21]. Diabetes was
defined as a self-reported history, or a fasting blood glu-
cose level (FBG)  7.0 mmol/L, or a random blood glucose
level (RBG)  11.1 mmol/L or reported use of medication
[22]. A FBG required no caloric intake for at least 8 hours
prior to the collection of the blood sample. Dyslipidemia
was defined as a self-reported history, or measured total
cholesterol level  6.21 mmol/L, or low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) > 4.1 mmol/L, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <
1.19 mmol/L, or triglyceride > 2.2.5 mmol/L or taking
medication for the condition [23, 24].
The hsCRP was categorized as low (<1 mg/L), inter-
mediate (1­3 mg/L), or high (>3 mg/L) [25, 26]. Abso-
lute risk of suffering a cardiac-related event or death
(CVD risk) over ten years following the baseline inter-
view was calculated using Pooled Risk Score Equations
(ASCVD) [27] and Framingham Score [28], while risk of
CVD death was calculated using the Harvard Risk Score
[29]. These three risk scores use different combinations
of age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure,
reported diabetes, and either cholesterol values or
body-mass index to predict risk. Angina was defined
as self-report, or using a validated subset of questions
from the Rose Angina Questionnaire relating to chest
pain, exertion, and symptom resolution [30­32]. Self-
reported current medication use for hypertension, dia-
betes, and dyslipidemia was also obtained during the
interview. For prevalence of HIV we used the blood
results from a protocol of sequential assays. Specific-
ally, the Vironostika Uniform 11 (Biomeriuex, France)
screening assay was used to detect the presence of
the virus; and in samples that tested positive, the
Roche Elecys (USA) assay (confirmatory) was used to
determine the viral load on DBS. Contradictory re-
sults were resolved using the Siemens Centaur XP
(USA) immunoassay, in accordance with World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines [33, 34]. HIV+ persons
who tested positive for the presence of ART medica-
tions were deemed compliant with ARV treatment.
All analyses were conducted using SAS ® V9.4 and
STATA ® V14 software.

Results
General population
Out of the 5,890 persons identified for recruitment who
were alive and residing in the study area, 85.9% (5,059)
agreed to be interviewed, 7.3% refused to participate,
6.0% could not be located, and 0.8% were unable to par-
ticipate. Thirty-one percent of the population was born
outside South Africa. In Table 1 we report the baseline
mean values of the biological and clinical risk factors by
sex. The cohort was 46.4% male, had a mean age of 61.7
(±13.1) years, and women had both a higher mean weight
(72.7 ± 19.1 kg; p < 0.001) and mean systolic blood pres-
sure (138.1 ± 23.3 mmHg; p = 0.703) compared to men
(70.0 ± 16.9 kg; 137.9 ± 23.5 mmHg). The waist-to-hip ra-
tio (WHR) for both genders was high [19] (0.9 ± 0.1 men;
0.9 ± 0.1 women; p < 0.001) and smoking prevalence
was substantially higher among men (19.2% vs. 0.4%;
p < 0.001) (Table 1). DBS tests for HIV antibody tests revealed
that 22.5% of the cohort was HIV+ (22.4% males; 22.6% fe-
males) and among those who tested positive, the presence of
ART medications was detected in 662/1,035 (64%).
In Table 2 we report the prevalence of cardiometabolic
disease risk factors based on standard criteria. The preva-
lence of hypertension was 58% overall with a higher
prevalence among women (61.8 vs. 54.5%; p < 0.001) as
well as an expected increase in prevalence with age. Rates
of any dyslipidemia were also high with over 43% of the
population having at least one abnormality in their lipid
profile. The results of the individual lipid parameters how-
ever showed differences between men and women that re-
flect different risk profiles. Women overall had a higher
prevalence of high total and LDL cholesterol compared to
men; but lower prevalence of low HDL (31.3% of men;
22.5% of women; p < 0.001). The prevalence of diabetes
overall was approximately 11%, also increasing with age
and with higher rates among women (11.9 vs. 10.1% in
men; p = 0.048). This measure may be an underestimate
given that the prevalence of a blood glucose value greater
than 7.0 mmol/L among fasting samples (completed in
only one tenth of all participants) was 13.29%. Nearly
two-thirds of the cohort had an abnormal BMI with
6.7% being underweight and 58.0% being overweight
or obese (44% of men; 70% of women). Nearly 40% of
the population had hsCRP levels that are considered
high with females having a greater value than men
(41.0 vs 35.4% respectively, p <0.001).
The prevalence of reported advanced cardiovascular
conditions such as angina, stroke, "heart attack", and heart
failure was relatively low given the prevalence of risk fac-
tors (Table 3). Except for myocardial infarction (MI),
women had higher self-reported prevalence of CVD con-
ditions, with a statistically significantly higher (p = 0.014)
angina prevalence (women 2.84%; men 1.79%), which in-
creased to 8.19% and 12.47% when Rose criteria were

included (Table 4). Furthermore, using Rose Criteria [32],
we observed a statistically significant increase in the
prevalence of angina across age categories for both men
(p < 0.001) and women (p = 0.002). In a multivariate re-
gression of the outcome of angina, the only associations
that were significant were age and female sex, after con-
trolling for hsCRP, smoking, Total and HDL cholesterol
and blood pressure.
The predicted risk of CVD-related events and mortal-
ity increased across age categories for both men and
women, regardless of the risk scores used; with overall
risk notably higher for men than women (Table 5). Over
a period of ten years, the Harvard Risk Score predicted a
mean absolute risk of cardiovascular death at 11.3% for
the entire cohort, while the Framingham score predicted
a 12.2% risk for CMD and related mortality, compared
to a risk of 9.9% for CMD and related mortality using
the ASCVD risk score
HIV status
Evaluation of CMD risk factors by HIV status revealed
an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The mean
age for those who are HIV- was 63 years, compared to
55 years for those who are HIV+. Furthermore, the
prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity was
significantly higher among those without HIV infection
(Table 6). Additionally, HIV+ males had a significantly
higher prevalence of underweight (p = 0.007) compared to
their HIV- counterparts (Table 6) and higher hsCRP levels
(3.68 vs 3.12, p < 0.001; data not shown). Furthermore
those without HIV-infection had consistently higher pro-
portions of multiple CMD co-morbidities, compared to

their HIV+ counterparts. For example, nearly 35% of HIV+
persons had 2 or more conditions compared to nearly
51% among HIV- persons (Table 7). Women also had a
consistently higher prevalence than men across all cat-
egories, regardless of HIV-infection status (Table 7). When
including HIV-infection as a co-morbid condition, overall,
55.7% (n = 2,820) of the cohort had at least 2 co-morbid
CMD conditions (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia,
angina, obesity, heart failure, HIV+), 24.5% (n = 1,239) had
at least 3, and 6.8% (n = 344) had at least 4 (Table 7). Risk
of multiple co-morbidities also generally increased with
age, as expected (data not shown).
Discussion
Our baseline findings from the HAALSI study indicate
that CMD risk is high in this rural, middle-aged and
older South African cohort and indeed, when coupled
with the high prevalence of HIV, it is evident the popula-
tion is experiencing a complex epidemiologic transition
characterized, in part, by an intense and interacting
double burden of cardiometabolic and infectious disease.
The cohort is at increased risk for CMD based on the
distribution of traditional risk factors some of which fall
at, or beyond, the upper limit for the rural or provincial
prevalence reported for the province in a nationally rep-
resentative sample [17]. Approximately 80% of both men
and women had hsCRP levels in the intermediate to high
range which likely reflects elevated systemic inflammation
(Table 2). While this could involve a number of factors,
the high level of overweight and obesity recorded suggests
that body fat distribution may be a key influence. The in-
crease in hsCRP needs further evaluation to assess the
magnitude of risk and to determine if it serves as a greater
predictor of risk in this population [6, 16, 35].
The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity
are greater among women than men, however women
had lower rates of low HDL-levels and smoking. The
greater obesity in women is consistent with other studies
in South Africa and the region [17, 36]. Smoking rates
overall are relatively low and men report current smok-
ing at almost 23 times the rate of women. Despite this
disparity between genders, smoking is likely under re-
ported for both groups as the SANHANES Study reports
that 55-79% of men and 53-62% of women report smok-
ing daily. While the overall lipid profiles for the cohort
were comparable to participants in the SANHANES
Study [17], men and women in HAALSI had higher
HDL levels than those measured for SANHANES partici-
pants older than 35. Still, the increased risk of CVD due
to abnormal HDL levels continues to be of concern in this
predominantly Black population since the SANHANES
sample measured the highest levels of abnormal HDL in
rural populations, with 1 out of 2 black men and women
aged 15­65 having this risk factor. The WHR of women
in our cohort was also higher (0.89 vs. 0.85), as it was for
men (0.92 vs. 0.87), compared to SANHANES.
Additionally, the burden of HIV-infection adds to the
prevalence of those with significant and multiple co-
morbidities, corroborating findings from a previous study
in the Agincourt population where more than 50% had at
least one chronic condition (CVD or HIV). In that study,
CMD risk factors increased with age except for low levels
of HDL [14]. The biggest drivers of CMD in the present
cohort are abdominal obesity and hypertension, and also
dyslipidemia and smoking for men. SANHANES, further
emphasizing the cohort's increased CMD risk.
The United Nations estimated that approximately 5
million men and women over the age of 15 were living
with HIV in South Africa in 2014 [37]. With ART cover-
age now so extensive, it is likely that the cohort popula-
tion will benefit from an extended lifespan. As a result

of this increased longevity, we would expect an increase
in the prevalence of CMD and associated risk factors
among those who are HIV+. In this cohort we observed
that the dyslipidemia prevalence is similar amongst HIV+
and HIV- persons, which is likely due to the higher preva-
lence of obesity in the former population.
The prevalence of hypertension in the overall cohort is
at the high end of the observed range in the SANHANES
sample which may be explained, at least in part, by the
high obesity levels. The impact of HIV-infection on the
overall prevalence however has competing influences.

African populations [38], which can lower blood pressure.
In contrast high levels of inflammation in the general
ageing population has been shown to be associated with
increases in blood pressure [39]. It is unclear what the
contribution of elevated hsCRP is towards developing
hypertension in this HIV+ population with varying levels
of ART. The overall risk of future co-morbid and fatal
events appears to be considerable in this population.
Follow-up mortality and cause-of-death data on cohort
participants, derived from the HDSS, will allow us to de-
fine more sharply the upcoming CMD burden and associ-
ated mortality expected in this cohort and, indeed,
throughout much of rural South Africa where a similar
risk and morbidity profile pertains [17].
This initial study serves as a valuable assessment of
CMD conditions in this rural aging population where
the prevalence of many of the conditions was found to
be quite high. More importantly, it sets up a baseline to
compare in the ensuing planned longitudinal follow-up.
In the follow-up study, we will be able to evaluate the
rate of change of the CMD conditions in this population.
While the younger age of the HIV+ cohort may explain
some of the lower prevalence of CMD conditions, other
factors such as increasing use of ART may change this.
We also will be able to assess the impact of treatment of
HIV-infection on the change in prevalence of CMD
conditions, and improved or diminished access to
care. Further we plan to specifically focus on the im-
pact of inflammatory markers on the progression of
vascular disease. Finally, we will be able to look at
the impact of changes in migratory status on health
and health system seeking behaviors. Further analyses
will include evaluating electrocardiograms and echo-
cardiograms to see if there is confirmatory evidence
of underreporting of CMD conditions.
Strengths
Earlier findings show that temporary (largely labor) mi-
grants returning to Agincourt after periods in towns carry
a higher risk of death from noncommunicable diseases
(NCDs), thus identifying the internal migrants as a risk
group warranting further investigation [40, 41]. A major
strength of this study is that the Agincourt HDSS is well
prepared to undertake follow-up of residents in the
catchment area of the study, and also to track in-
ternal migrants who move temporarily or permanently
out of the sub-district. The large sample size, the
wide range of cardiovascular disease-related variables
collected, and the collection of biological samples are
all added strengths.
Limitations
This data has limitations associated with all cross-sectional
assessments, limiting the extent to which causal inferences
can be made. The use of point-of-care (POC) testing for
lipid and glucose levels is also a potential limitation, when
compared to measurements obtained through conven-
tional laboratory testing. However, the machines used to
obtain POC testing have been validated against current
laboratory-based methods [42, 43].
Conclusions
This cohort is experiencing an increased risk of CMD with
age, as expected. Further, it appears that the HIV+ popula-
tion has many of the chronic CMD risk factors to contend
with as well. With the increase in co-morbidities associ-
ated with HIV-infection, their longer-term impact on
screening, prevention, and treatment of CMD needs to be
better understood. Indeed, the health system challenges
posed by the evolving chronic disease trajectories are pro-
found with little precedent elsewhere.
The establishment of the HAALSI cohort is timely in
order to assess the evolution of long-term CMD risks in
a rural population that is living longer with HIV (and is
thus exposed to prolonged antiretroviral therapy); and to
inform the many parts of South and sub-Saharan Africa
confronting similar realities. The INDEPTH Network of
population-based research centers ­ reflecting the range
of transitional settings across southern, East and West
Africa ­ provides a potential vehicle for harmonized re-
search to generate the evidence essential to policy and
practice [44].
