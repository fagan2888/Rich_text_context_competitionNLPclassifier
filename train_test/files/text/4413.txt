Introduction
Worker attitudes toward organizations have drawn attention
from scholars in organization science, organizational behav-
ior, and industrial and organizational psychology. Studies on
attitudes focus frequently on organizational commitment
(OC) and turnover intention. One of the important conse-
quences of OC is the link between OC and employee inten-
tion to leave the organization and actual turnover (Allen &
Meyer, 1996; Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Tett & Meyer, 1993).
There are a plethora of studies on OC (Allen & Meyer,
1990; Allen & Meyer, 1996; Benkhoff, 1997; Elloy & Flynn,
1998; Gordon & Ladd, 1990; Hui, Lee, & Rousseau, 2004;
Lincoln & Kalleberg, 1990; McConnell, 2006; Meyer &
Allen, 1997; Tett & Meyer, 1993). These studies investigated
the antecedents of OC and consequences of such commit-
ment to a single organization. Mathieu and Zajac (1990)
reviewed and conducted meta-analysis of the antecedents,
correlates, and consequences of OC. They found that most
studies have investigated the relationships between OC and
organizational structural characteristics, career enhancement
opportunities, union commitment relationships, and so forth,
in sampled employees from a single organization. They
advocated that a greater number of studies need to be con-
ducted with employees sampled from a wide variety of orga-
nizations to adequately test the relationships between OC
and its antecedents. This study attempts to meet that need.
Studies on OC in unionized and non-unionized settings are
scarce although several studies have investigated dual com-
mitment to the union and the organization (Gordon, Beauvais,
& Ladd, 1984; Gordon & Ladd, 1990; Gordon, Philpot, Burt,
Thompson, & Spiller, 1980). Gordon et al. (1980) studied
members' commitment to a labor organization and found that
the benefits unions provide their members emerged as the
most important basis for union commitment. Tetrick (1995),
however, argued that the development and maintenance of
union commitment is contingent on the mutual obligation of
the union and its members centered on a social exchange,
rather than an economic exchange model. Thacker, Fields,
and Barclay (1990) examined antecedent and outcome mod-
els for four factors of union commitment (loyalty to the union,
responsibility to the union, willingness to work for the union,
and belief in unionism). Gordon, Beauvais, and Ladd (1984)
provided empirical evidence of dual allegiance to the union
and to management in the job satisfaction and union commit-
ment of unionized engineers.

Organizational Commitment and
Turnover Intention in Union and Non-
Union Firms
Hong Y. Park1, Raymond L. Christie2, and Gail E. Sype1
Abstract
There are differences in organizational architecture between union and non-union construction firms in early 1990s. The
construction industry has traditionally been dominated by strong union firms. However, non-union construction firms began
to emerge in the 1990s and this change caused to bring conflicts between union and non-union construction firms. This
presents a unique opportunity to study employees' attitude toward organization. This article investigates workers' attitudes
toward union and non-union construction firms in terms of organizational commitment (OC) and turnover intention.
Control variables in OC and turnover intention include personal characteristics, job characteristics, group-leader relations
and organizational characteristics. The study found that employees in union firms are more committed to the organization
than non-union organization, but they have higher intention to job turnover although the regression coefficients of union
variable in commitment and turnover intention are not statistically significant at the conventional level of significance.

Gordon and Ladd (1990) reviewed and examined dual
allegiance studies based on the taxonomic approach. They
argued that dual allegiance must offer unique predictive
power above that of company allegiance and union alle-
giance for even one dependent variable (productivity or
effectiveness), and if no such relationship can be isolated,
then dual allegiance may be considered an epiphenomenon
and dismissed from serious scientific inquiry.
This article will examine determinants of the commitment
and impact of commitment on the intention to quit in union
and non-union settings in the construction industry.
Employees were sampled from many different organizations.
The union firm in the construction industry is different from
the non-union firm in hiring practices, participation in deci-
sion making, methods of rewarding individuals, evaluations
of individual performance, duration of employment with the
same firm, hierarchical levels of the organization, and pay.
These differences between union and non-union firms may
be regarded as differences in organizational architecture.
Brickley, Smith, and Zimmerman (2008) refer to the assign-
ment of decision rights within the firm, the methods of
rewarding individuals, and the structure of systems to evalu-
ate the performance of individuals and business units as the
firm's organizational architecture. The organization of work
in construction firms also differs from manufacturing and
service firms. Production in construction firms is divided
into a variety of trades, and it is common practice for general
contractors to subcontract portions of a project to a special
trade.
Political and economic environments in the U.S. con-
struction industry have changed in the 1980s and 1990s, as
non-union firms emerged prominently in the early 1990s. As
non-union firms were growing, workers in union firms faced
uncertainty and threat of wage cuts and loss of job security.
The impact of these threats on OC needs to be evaluated,
because employees tend to modify their behavior toward the
company as they face threat. We have observed that threats
of wage and job reductions due to globalization, downsiz-
ing, and outsourcing have made changes easier in the U.S.
firms.
The organizational differences in union and non-union
firms in the construction industry, job characteristics of con-
struction firms, and emergence of non-union firms in the
1990s present a unique opportunity to study the impact of
OC on employees in union and non-union firms. Such
research is critical because of the link between commitment
and turnover, which are important determining factors of
organizational stability and performance. Traditional OC
studies have focused on stability and performance as conse-
quences of OC. Perhaps important additional dimensions of
consequences in OC are implications in agency costs and
corporate changes. Committed employees may help reduce
agency costs and make corporate changes easier. These ele-
ments are very crucial in today's business environments
where continuing improvements are required.
Employees' OC
OC has frequently been conceptualized and measured in
three different ways: the affective component, the continu-
ance component, and the normative component. According
to Allen and Meyer (1990), the affective component of OC
refers to employees' emotional attachment to, identification
with, and involvement in the organization. The continuance
commitment refers to commitment based on the costs that
employees associate with leaving an organization. The nor-
mative commitment refers to employees' feelings of obliga-
tion to remain with the organization. Allen and Meyer (1996)
surveyed the OC literature and found an inverse relationship
between commitment and job turnover in all studies they
have examined. The measurement of OC in this study is
affective commitment. Mowday, Porter, and Steers (1982)
defined attitudinal OC as
The relative strength of an individual's identification with and
involvement in a particular organization. Conceptually, it can be
characterized by at least three factors: a) a strong belief in and
acceptance of the organization's goal and values; b) a willingness
to exert considerable effort on behalf of the organization; and c) a
strong desire to maintain membership in the organization. (p. 27)
This concept of OC benefits employees, organizations,
and society as a whole. Mathieu and Zajac (1990) articulated
well the benefits of OC:
Employees' level of commitment to an organization may make
them more eligible to receive both extrinsic (e.g., wages and
benefits) and psychological (e.g., intrinsic job satisfaction and
relationships with coworkers) rewards associated with
membership. Organizations value commitment among their
employees, which is typically assumed to reduce withdrawal
behaviors such as lateness and turnover. In addition, committed
employees may be more likely to engage in "extra-role"
behaviors, such as creativeness or innovativeness, which are
often what keeps an organization competitive (Katz & Kahn,
1978). From a larger perspective, a society as a whole tends to
benefit from employees' organizational commitment in terms of
lower rates of job movement and perhaps higher national
productivity or work quality or both. (p. 171)
Benefits of OC suggest that OC should reduce job turn-
over and agency costs. Agency costs are costs associated with
aligning interests of the principal (organization) and agents
(employees). Lately, agency costs have become huge prob-
lems to organizations, employees, and society as a whole, as
we have observed from Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom.
The Characteristics of Construction
Work in Union and Non-Union
Construction Firms
In the construction industry, today there is a distinct division
of labor, with such categories as asbestos workers, boiler
Park et al. 3
makers, carpenters, cement masons, electrical workers, ele-
vator construction workers, glaziers, iron workers, laborers,
millwrights, operating engineers, painters, plasterers, plumb-
ers, pipe fitters, roofers, sheet metal workers, and others.
Construction projects are performed by these labor special-
ists in some serial sequence.
In construction, the various specialties build on the work
of other specialties, but the intermediate product does not
move, as it does in manufacturing. Instead the intermediate
product is fixed and the specialists move. Furthermore, labor
specialists can become subcontractors or be hired by general
contractors. Eccles (1981) describes parties involved and
relationships among them in construction projects in the fol-
lowing way:
The organization of construction projects involves relationships
among the owner, the general contractor, and various special
trade contractors. Most typically, the owner writes a general
contractwithageneralcontractorwhoassumestotalresponsibility
for accomplishing the project. Often these projects are for a fixed
price on a total or unit of work basis and have time deadlines and
financial incentives and penalties. Other forms include cost plus
contracts which can also have incentives and penalties. For fixed
price contracts general contractors are usually selected by
competitive bidding among a group of firms who have been
qualified to bid for the project. (p. 338)
Eccles (1981) further argues that relations between the
general contractor and subcontractors are stable and con-
tinuous over fairly long periods of time, because transac-
tion costs would be high if, for every new project, a general
contractor solicited bids from a number of subcontractors
for each trade. He calls this type of quasi-integration
between the general contractor and subcontractors the
"quasifirm."
In the construction industry, the degree of quasi-integra-
tion differs among firms, and the difference is more pro-
nounced between the union firm and the non-union firm. The
key difference between the two is that the union firm has at
its disposal skilled craftsmen who can be called upon from
the union as demand dictates. In essence, the union performs
the function of human resource planning, whereas the non-
union firm assumes the responsibility of its own human
resource planning.
The union contractor works with the union to control the
recruitment of new entrants into the skilled trade unions.
Most new entrants go through 4 years of apprenticeship
training before receiving journeyman status. Hiring is usu-
ally done annually. Selection is made by the joint apprentice-
ship board comprising contractors and union representatives,
and hiring practices in the union firm are governed by union
contracts. Most skilled trade unions have similar rules regu-
lating the disposition of their members, a process called the
referral system. In this system, the union selects and refers
applicants on request of the contractor, who can accept or
reject all referrals made by the union. The employer also has
the opportunity to pick from the specified number of candi-
dates on the list.
From the workers' standpoint, there is little difference
between firms, as the job function is virtually the same
between firms, and pay and benefits are identical under the
union contract. Workers frequently move from one firm to
another, depending on the demand for workers. Only a select
few maintain consistent employment with one particular
firm for an extended period of time.
The non-union firm, however, assumes the responsibility
of human resource planning. This firm conducts its own
recruiting from the general labor pool and then trains work-
ers; it tends to retain its workers during slack times to reduce
the problem of finding experienced workers.
The union firms' organizational architecture can be char-
acterized as less hierarchical than non-union firms: Union
workers have more decision rights, they are rewarded based
on the union contract, and their performances are less moni-
tored than non-union workers. However, union construction
workers work for many different firms, although they may
work for the same firm many times during their career.
In union firms, decision rights are assigned more to the
union, whereas in non-union firms managers have more
decision rights. Rewards in union firms are primarily deter-
mined by the terms and conditions of employment as speci-
fied in union contracts, and union workers are much better
paid. Although non-union employees' wages are lower, non-
union firms have in place discretionary work incentives,
such as bonuses and profit sharing. Performances of employ-
ees are more closely monitored in non-union firms than
union firms. These differences in organizational architecture
of union and non-union construction firms illustrate that the
union firms utilize more indirect control than the non-union
firms, as summarized in Table 1.
Characteristics of union and non-union construction firms
have mixed combinations of positive and negative dimen-
sions for OC and turnover intention. For example, non-union
firms have positive characteristics for OC in duration of
employment and reward system, but negative characteristics
in control and performance evaluation. These positive and
adverse dimensions of union and non-union firms are likely
to have effect on OC. We summarize the positive (+) and
negative (-) characteristics in organizational architecture of
union and non-union firms in Table 2. These differences may
have implications for firm efficiency and performance
(Jensen & Heckling, 1995; Milgrom & Roberts, 1992). This
study examines the impact of organizational architectural
differences in union and non-union firms on OC and turn-
over intention.
OC differentials between employees in union and non-
union firms will depend on the net effect of these positive
and negative dimensions of union and non-union firms. We
believe that union firms' positive dimensions may outweigh
the non-union firms' positive dimensions in regard to OC.
Therefore, we formulate the following hypothesis.
4 SAGE Open
Hypothesis 1: Workers in union firms are likely to be
more committed to the organization.
Workers in union firms enjoy higher pay and more auton-
omy, whereas non-union firms rely on the individual incen-
tive system such as bonuses and profit sharing for the selected
workers. Pay is inversely related to turnover and the indi-
vidual incentive system tends to increase functional turnover
(Park, Ofori-Dankwa, & Bishop, 1994). The turnover study
by Park et al. (1994) contributes to the job turnover function-
ality and several turnover functionality has drawn scholars
interests (Guthrie, 2000; Lee & Jimenez, 2011; Shaw, Delery,
Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998; Shaw, Dineen, Fang, & Vellella,
2009). Studies also found that there is a close relationship
between intention to leave (quit) and turnover (Mathieu &
Zajac, 1990; Tett & Meyer, 1993). Based on the low pay,
individual incentive system of non-union firms, we can draw
the second hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2: Workers in union firms are less likely to
quit the organization than workers in non-union firms.
Control Variables
Many studies have examined the relations between affective
commitment and its antecedents. The wide range of vari-
ables that have been investigated were presented in the cat-
egories of personal characteristics, group-leader relations,
organizational characteristics, and role states in Mathien and
Zajac's meta-analysis of antecedents of OC (Mathieu &
Zajac, 1990). We closely follow those categories in our
study and formulate additional hypotheses on antecedents
that were not investigated in previous studies.
Personal Characteristics
Personal characteristics in our study include age, gender,
educational attainment, organizational tenure, trade tenure,
and salary. The results of Mathieu and Zajac's (1990) meta-
analysis show that age, organizational tenure, salary, and
ability have positive relationships with OC. Marital status
and level of education attained are inversely related to OC.
We hypothesize that our study will confirm the Mathieu and
Zajac's results.
The likelihood of bonuses and pay increases, which were
not investigated in previous studies are included in our study.
These should make employees feel good about the organiza-
tion and we believe that there will be a positive relationship
between the perceived bonus and pay increase and OC.
Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of bonus pay and pay
increases will have a positive association with OC.
This study also investigates the effect of threat of wage
reductions on OC. Construction employees in union firms
faced a threat of wage reductions as non-union firms emerged

in the 1990s. Today, many employees in the United States
face problems such as wage reductions and job eliminations
because of globalization, downsizing, and off-shore out-
sourcing. The effect of wage reduction on OC may offer a
clue to the effect of similar threats, such as downsizing and
outsourcing, on OC. Based on the above premises, we for-
mulate Hypothesis 4.
Hypothesis 4: There will be a positive relationship
between a threat of wage reductions and OC.
Construction employees experience frequent layoffs and
the number of layoffs will have an adverse effect on OC;
therefore, we formulate Hypothesis 5.
Hypothesis 5: The number of layoffs will show an inverse
relationship with OC.
Job Characteristics
Job characteristics investigated in Mathieu and Zajac's meta-
analysis are skill variety, task autonomy, job challenge, and
job scope. These have positive relationships with OC. We
added job security, flexibility, and job satisfaction in our
study. We also hypothesize that there will be a positive rela-
tionship between job characteristics and OC.
Group-Leader Relations
An employee connects to an organization through relation-
ships with the immediate supervisor and peers. Wayne,
Shore, and Linden (1997) developed and tested a model of
the antecedents and consequences in OC and they investi-
gated perceived organizational support and leader-member
exchange. They found that leader-member exchange posi-
tively related to organizational citizen behavior and OC.
Antecedents in group-leader relationships are task indepen-
dence, leader competency, co-workers, participative leader-
ship, and leader understanding. We hypothesize that these
variables will reveal a positive relationship with OC.
Organizational Characteristics
Organizational characteristics typically deal with organiza-
tional size and organizational centralization (Mathieu & Zajac,
1990). However, we investigate characteristics of union and
non-union firms in the construction industry, in which non-
union firms are more hierarchical than union firms in the con-
struction industry. As illustrated before, our study adds
additional dimensions to the organizational characteristics.
Turnover Intention
The important consequences of OC are its relationships with
turnover intention and actual turnover. Studies on the
relationships between OC and the employees' intention to
leave the organization and actual turnover report consistent
negative correlations (Allen & Meyer, 1996; Mathieu &
Zajac, 1990; Tett & Meyer, 1993).
This study investigates the relationship between OC and
employee intention to quit the organization. Steel and Ovalle's
(1984) meta-analysis on turnover found that intention to quit
the organization is the strongest predictor of turnover.
Hypothesis 6: Committed employees are less likely to
quit the organization and we hypothesize that there will be
an inverse relationship between OC and intention to quit
the organization.
Several studies made comparisons of relative importance
of OC and job satisfaction to intention to quit the organiza-
tion (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Carsten & Spector, 1987;
Hom & Hulin, 1981; Hom, Katerberg, & Hulin, 1979; Steel
& Ovalle, 1984; Tett & Meyer, 1993). These studies report
that satisfaction and commitment each uniquely contribute to
turnover intention.
There are also many studies on the relationship between
job satisfaction and OC. Martin and Bennett (1996) classify
them into four models: (a) job satisfaction as antecedent to
OC, (b) OC as antecedent to job satisfaction, (c) OC and job
satisfaction as reciprocally related, (d) OC and job satisfac-
tion as independent.
The model that specifies job satisfaction as an antecedent
of OC has received considerable support. The relationship
between OC and job satisfaction has been found to be posi-
tively correlated (Bateman & Strasser, 1984; Bluedorn,
1982; Mulinge, 2001). We investigate the impact of job sat-
isfaction, OC, and intention to quit the organization.
Hypothesis 7: Satisfied employees are likely to be
strongly committed to the organization and less likely to
quit the organization.
Construction employees tend to work for more firms than
employees in other industries. They are similar to knowledge
workers in consulting firms and they are exposed to different
firms and working environments. Construction employees'
experiences with various organizations may help develop
adaptabilities to changes and different working environments.
Hypothesis 8: There will be a positive relationship
between the number of firms worked and turnover
intention.
Control Variable in Turnover Intention
Model
Albelson and Baysinger (1984) indicated that individual,
organizational, and environmental attributes influence the
employee's perception of costs and benefits associated with
6 SAGE Open
the entire process of quitting one employment opportunity
and joining another.
Numerous studies (Jackofsky & Peters, 1983; Mobley,
Griffeth, Hand, & Meglino, 1979: Porter & Steers, 1973)
have investigated turnover based on individual attributes.
These studies have examined individual characteristics such
as age, gender, length of service, level of employment, level
of skill, education, and ability. We will include age, gender,
length of employment, education, salary, satisfaction, and
commitment as individual characteristic variables in this
study.
Organizational characteristics associated with turnover
are integration, communication, centralization, routinization,
professionalization, upward mobility, distributive justice,
and firm size. Antecedents included as organizational char-
acteristics are the same as those included in the commitment
model.
Environmental characteristics are geographic location,
environmental turbulence, size of metropolitan area, compe-
tition in the market place, economic conditions, and support
organizations. This study does not include environmental
characteristics because we draw our data and sample from
one region in Midwestern states. We include a perceived job
opportunity variable in our study that may reflect what the
environment characteristics try to capture.
Method
Data used for the study are based on construction industry
employer and employee surveys, administered in 1992. The
employer survey was designed to find out characteristics of
union and non-union construction firms. The employee sur-
vey was designed to study employee attitudes toward OC,
turnover intention, and job satisfaction. We obtained a mail-
ing list of construction firms in three counties in the
Midwestern region of the United States from Dun and
Bradstreet. The list consists of 530 firms of general contrac-
tors (SIC 15) and 913 firms of special trade contractors (SIC
17). We mailed 1,443 surveys, which included all construc-
tion firms listed in Dun & Bradstreet, from the identified
region. Of the 1,443 surveys mailed, 121 firms responded.
As many of the firms listed in Dun & Bradstreet did not stay
in the construction business, the 121 firms that responded
make up about 10% of the population. Of the surveys
returned, 23 indicated they are union firms and 87 indicated
they are non-union firms.
The employee survey consisted of four parts: (a) demo-
graphic characteristics, education, and experiences; (b) work
safety, work environment, and organizational characteristics;
(c) OC and intention to quit; (d) motivation and job satisfac-
tion. The survey questionnaire we used in this study followed
closely the survey questionnaire of Maloney and McFillen
(1984). We obtained the use of 6,150 home addresses of con-
struction employees from the state employment and security
office. Eight hundred and ninety three surveys were returned;
of these, 130 surveys were incomplete and 55 survey respon-
dents failed to indicate whether they worked for union or
non-union forms. Thus, we used 652 survey respondents in
our study. Of these, 340 were hourly employees in union
firms and 312 were from non-union firms. Survey respon-
dents skipped some questions in the survey; thus, the number
of observations varies.
Measures
Measurements of the data are largely a Likert-type 7-point
scale. There are, however, some numerical interval scale data
such as age, years of employment, years of technical school,
years of education, pay and benefits. Union versus non-union
employees (union = 1, non-union = 0), gender (male = 1,
female = 0), and marital status (married = 1, not married = 0)
are dummy variables in the model. The Cronbach's alpha
was calculated to see the internal reliability of multi-item
measures of variables such as commitment and satisfaction.
Commitment was measured with Allen and Meyer's (1990)
eight-item affective commitment scale. The 7-point response
scales ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree
(7). The Cronbach's alpha was .869. General job satisfaction
was measured by asking respondents to show their level of
agreement with the two items: (a) all in all, I am satisfied
with working my trade and (b) In general, I like working at
my trade. The reliability test score showed the -value of
.858.
Other multi-item variables in the model and their reliabil-
ity test scores were intrinsic reward (seven items;  = .892);
participation in decision making (two items;  = .804); inter-
personal relationships with co-workers (three items;  =.820);
foreman's bias (three items;  = .676); working conditions
(two items;  = .739); professional commitment (four items;
 = 7.34); perceived performance (two items;  = .719);
accomplishment (two items;  = .647); work autonomy (three
items;  = .824); work flexibility (two items;  = .912); fore-
man's understanding your work (two items;  = 702); work-
er's aspiration (three items;  = .704); and job security (two
items;  = .822). The rest of the variables were measured in a
single-item question. These  values show that measuments
are reliable.
Empirical Results
Regression coefficients of multiple regression models were
estimated, with the sampled data and results presented in
Table 3.
The survey asked questions regarding the number of lay-
offs, the number of construction firms worked, and incentive
systems, to find out differences in organizational characteris-
tics of union and non-union firms. The 73% of non-union
firm employees worked for a single firm and 48% of union
firm employees worked for a single firm. The average num-
ber of firms worked for in the previous year was 1.4 in
Park et al. 7
non-union firms and 2.4 in union firms. The percent of zero
layoffs in non-union firms was 31.3% and in union firms,
10.6%. The average number of layoffs for non-union and
union firms was 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. The prevalent
form of work incentives in non-union firms was bonus pay.
Personal data indicated that employees in non-union firms
were younger than union firm employees; the average age of
non-union firm employees was 35.6 years, compared with
40.3 years for union-firm employees. The average number of
years in current trades was 12.1 years for non-union employ-
ees, 17.7 for union employees. The average hourly pay was
US$10.69 for non-union employees, compared with
US$17.11 for union employees, in 1992 dollars.

Statistically significant variables at the conventional level
of significance ( = .01, .05 and .10) in the commitment
model are age, organizational tenure, hourly pay, likelihood
of pay increase, likelihood of wage cut, accomplishment, job
flexibility, foreman's understanding, organizational policy,
work rules, inspiration, professional commitment, and loy-
alty to union.
Statistically significant variables in the turnover intention
model are age, trade tenure, ability, likelihood of bonus and
pay increase, perceived performance, OC, number of con-
struction firms worked, participation in decision making,
foreman's understanding, foreman's bias, and professional
commitment and job satisfaction.
Discussion
The variables in organizational characteristics reveal inter-
esting results. Employees in union firms show a higher level
of commitment than non-union firm employees. The union
variable is a dummy variable (union = 1, non-union = 0, and
p value is .34.) The regression coefficient reveals that
employees' commitment in union firms is higher than that of
non-union firm employees by .154 in the 7-point scale. This
result may imply that the positive dimensions of union firms,
such as higher pay, indirect control, and less monitoring, out-
weigh the positive dimensions of non-union firms. The non-
union firm has positive dimensions in organizational tenure,
small size, pay bonuses, and less frequent layoffs. The
empirical result failed to confirm Hypothesis 1 at the con-
ventional level of significance, but revealed the hypothesized
direction of the relation between the union and OC. As com-
petition between union and non-union firms grows, both
sides modify their attitudes toward employers. Balser and
Winkler (2012) found that the leadership of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and union mem-
bers increases their labor-management cooperation in
response to increasing competition from the non-unionized
electrical contracting sector. This evidence shows that com-
petition drives changes in employees' attitudes and culture
(value) and changes in culture lead to changes in employee
behavior.
Organizational policy, work rule, and inspiration vari-
ables are statistically significant and show positive associa-
tion with OC. Inspiration has a strong association with OC.
Standardized regression coefficients (beta) indicate that the
inspiration variable is the most important variable in the
commitment model.
OC
Statistically significant personal characteristics in OC are
organizational tenure, hourly pay, likelihood of bonus and
pay increase, likelihood of wage cut and accomplishment.
The age variable reveals an inverse relationship with OC.
This result, which does not confirm Mathieu and Zajac's
(1990) meta-analysis, may be due to the nature of construc-
tion work. Construction employees' organizational tenure is
relatively short compared with other industries. As construc-
tion employees work for many firms over the years, they
may commit less to an organization.
The likelihood of bonuses and pay increase and threat of
wage cuts are statistically significant and reveal positive
signs. These aspects of personal characteristics have not
been explored in previous OC studies. The likelihood of
bonuses and pay increases represents employees' percep-
tions and outlook on the organization. The employees' per-
ceived bonuses and pay increases provide a better perspective
on the organization that he/she is working for. Therefore, he
or she is more likely to be loyal to the organization, and
the empirical results support Hypothesis 3.
The likelihood of wage cuts is an interesting variable. As
non-union firms have prominently emerged in the early
1990s, union firm employees felt threats of wage cuts and
showed strong commitment to their union firms. Today's
workers in the United States are facing similar threats as the
firms' input and output markets are changing rapidly. This
result supports Hypothesis 4. Workers are likely to be more
loyal to their organization and accept changes to save the
organization and their jobs. Kim's (1998) study demon-
strated that Hyundai Motor in Korea constructed crisis pro-
actively to shift learning orientation and facilitate
organizational learning.
Perceived accomplishment reveals a strong positive asso-
ciation with OC. Although the number of layoffs and per-
ceived job alternatives are not statistically significant, they
are inversely associated with OC. Frequent layoffs may gen-
erate resentment toward the organization. While the results
are consistent in direction with Hypothesis 5, they fall short
of meeting the conventional level of significance. Workers'

perceived job alternatives may offer hopes for jobs in other
organizations and make them less committed to the
organization.
Perceived job security has a positive association with OC,
but is not statistically significant. The job flexibility variable
is statistically significant and shows an inverse association
with OC. Job flexibility may mean that employees are
required to do specialties that they are not trained for. The
results indicate that employees prefer not to work specialties
that they are not well trained for. As job flexibility increases,
employees are less committed to their organizations.
The only statistically significant variable in group rela-
tions is foreman understanding. Co-worker relationship vari-
able falls just shy of statistical significance (p value = .12).
Foreman understanding shows a negative sign and appears to
contradict previous studies (Mathieu & Zajac, 1990).
Participation, foreman bias, and feedback confirm the previ-
ous findings in directions of association, but are not statisti-
cally significant at the conventional level of significance.
Professional commitment and union loyalty are statisti-
cally significant and show an inverse relationship with OC.
Employees more strongly committed to the profession and
union are less committed to the organization. These results
indicate that there is a trade-off between OC and commit-
ment to profession and union. This study is not designed to
study company and union dual allegiance (Gordon & Ladd,
1990; Thacker & Rosen, 1986) and should not be interpreted
as contradictory to the previous dual allegiance studies.
Consequences of OC
One of the important consequences of OC is a negative cor-
relation between OC and employee intention to quit the orga-
nization. The result of the turnover intention model strongly
supports Hypothesis 6 that there will be an inverse relation-
ship between OC and intention to quit the organization. This
result also confirms previous studies (Allen & Meyer, 1996;
Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Tett & Meyer, 1993). However, the
results indicate that OC holds higher relative importance
than does the job satisfaction variable.
Group relation characteristics showed a strong associa-
tion with the turnover intention, but they did not show strong
association with OC. Organizational characteristics variables
revealed a strong association with OC. Participatory man-
agement and foreman understanding have significant inverse
relationship with the intention to quit, which implies that
employees' participation in decision making and foreman
understanding reduces turnover. Foreman bias is found to
have a strong positive association with the intention to quit.
Therefore, foreman bias can foster employee turnover and
good relationships with co-workers may deter turnover, but
the latter association is not statistically significant.
Intention to quit in union firm employees is higher than in
non-union firm employees. Though there is turnover inten-
tion differential between union and non-union employees,
the differential is not statistically significant. The result fails
to confirm Hypothesis 2. However, the turnover differential
may indicate that union firm employees feel insecure about
their employment and seek alternative opportunity for the
same pay.
The job satisfaction variable is statistically significant in
the turnover intention model. However, it is not statistically
significant in the OC model only and partially confirms
Hypothesis 7. Fu and Deshpande (2012) obtained the same
results from a Chinese company.
The number of firms worked shows a statistically signifi-
cant positive association with the turnover intention and con-
firms Hypothesis 8. As employees work for more firms, they
develop abilities to adapt to new organizations, a factor likely
to increase turnover intention.
Limitations
Empirical studies on OC and turnover intention suffer from
measurement problems and this study is no exception.
Survey respondents are self-selected to respond to the survey
and there is a likelihood of selection or non-response bias.
Conclusion
The study investigated factors affecting OC and conse-
quences of OC in union and non-union construction firm set-
tings. The unique nature of construction firms permitted us to
study some additional dimensions of OC and turnover inten-
tion in our study. The study suggests that employees' OC in
union firms is higher than that of non-union firms, but
employees' turnover intension in union firms is higher than
employees in nonunion firms although both regression coef-
ficients are not statistically significant at the conventional
level of significance. The difference may stem from differ-
ences in organizational architecture of union and non-union
firms. Higher pay, indirect control, and less hierarchy in
union firms may explain the speculative commitment differ-
ential. Since employees in union fims work for more number
of firms than nonunion firm employees they might have
developed a better adaptive proclivity in changing organisa-
tions. Differences in organizational charateristics of union
and nonunion firms might have also dissipated over the years
as organizations compete to hire competent employees from
the same labor pool. We have investigated additional per-
sonal factors that were not examined in previous OC studies.
Economic factors such as hourly pay, likelihood of bonuses,
and pay increase and likelihood of wage cuts revealed sig-
nificant positive relationships with OC. The association
between the number of layoffs and OC was negative, but not
statistically significant. These findings indicate that eco-
nomic factors play an important role in OC.
Organizational characteristics such as work rules, organi-
zation policy, and inspiring employees were found to have
statistically significant association with OC. Therefore,
10 SAGE Open
inspiring employees and establishing fair policy and work
rules can improve employee OC.
We found that OC and job satisfaction have statistically
significant strong association with turnover intention, and
high job satisfaction can lower turnover intention and turn-
over. Perceived pay increases reduce turnover intention, but
the number of firms worked increases turnover intention.
Group factors were found to be statistically significant in
turnover intention compared with organizational factors in
OC. More employee participation in decision making, better
foreman understanding, and reduction of foreman bias may
lower turnover intention and turnover. We conclude that
managers need to pay attention to economic, organizational,
and group factors to improve OC and to reduce turnover
intention.
