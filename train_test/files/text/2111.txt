Impact of Major Depression and
Subsyndromal Symptoms on Quality of
Life and Attitudes Toward Aging in an
International Sample of Older Adults
Eduardo Chachamovich, PhD,1 Marcelo Fleck, PhD,1

Purpose: The impact of major depression on quality
of life (QOL) and aging experiences in older adults
has been reported. Studies have demonstrated that
the clinical diagnosis of major depression is the
strongest predictor for QOL. We postulate that some
findings are biased because of the use of inadequate
instruments. Although subsyndromal depression is
more prevalent than major depression, there are no
reports on its impact on QOL or attitudes toward
aging. In the present study we aim at assessing the
association of major and subsyndromal depression
on QOL and attitudes toward aging in a large
international sample. Design and Methods: Our
cross-sectional study assessed 4,316 respondents in
20 countries from five continents. The study used
the World Health Organization Quality of Life
(WHOQOL) Assessment for Older Adults, known
as the WHOQOL-OLD; the brief version of the
WHOQOL instrument, known as the WHOQOL-BREF;
and the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire. Statistical
analyses involved hierarchical multiple regression, as
well as comparison of means. Results: Even rela-
tively minor levels of depression are associated with
a significant decrease in all QOL domains and with
a pattern of negative attitudes toward aging (overall
WHOQOL-OLD R2 change = .421). QOL and
attitudes toward aging scores are lower as depres-
sion intensity is increased, even in subsyndromal
levels (overall WHOQOL-OLD mean scores of 95.7
vs 86.4, p , .001). This phenomenon happens not
only for clinically depressed individuals but also for
subsyndromic individuals. Implications: Present
findings suggest that classifying a respondent as
nondepressed is not sufficient and is still not
informative about his or her QOL and attitudes
toward aging status.
Key Words: Aging, Subclinical, Well-being
Depression has been recognized as a major mental
health problem in older adults. It is also the most
prevalent mental condition in elderly individuals
(Chan, Chien, Thompson, Chiu, & Lam, 2006). It is
currently projected that depression will be the
second leading cause of disability worldwide in
2020 (Demyttenaere et al., 2004). Furthermore, it
carries a poor prognosis, being associated with
increased mortality, morbidity, and the use of health
facilities (Covinsky et al., 1999; Dozeman et al.,
2007; Rovner, 1993; Street, O'Connor, & Robinson,
2007).
The impact of depression in quantitative out-
comes (such as mortality) has been extensively
demonstrated in the literature (Covinsky et al.,
1999). In addition, the role that major depression
plays in the quality of life and aging experiences in
older adults has been reported (Chan et al., 2006;
Low & Molzahn, 2007). Several studies have
demonstrated that the clinical diagnosis of major
depression is the most influential predictor for
impairments in quality of life (Chan et al.; Netuveli,
Wiggins, Hildon, Montgomery, & Blane, 2006;
Sobocki et al., 2007; Stafford, Berk, Reddy, &
Jackson, 2007), even when confounding factors (such
as age, gender, living arrangements, or physical
conditions) are controlled.

We postulate that some findings may be biased as
a result of the inadequacy of the instruments applied
in these investigations. The majority of instru-
ments have been used without adequate validation
(Haywood, Garratt, & Fitzpatrick, 2005), do not
take into consideration several aspects of life that
older adults consider fundamental (Pearlman &
Uhlmann, 1988), or are not suitable for older adults
because they have been developed primarily for
young adult populations (Brazier, Walters, Nicholl, &
Kohler, 1996; Chachamovich, Trentini, & Fleck,
2007; Power, Quinn, & Schmidt, 2005).
The prevalence of subsyndromal depression in
elderly individuals is more than double the one for
major depression (D. G. Blazer, 2003; Geiselmann &
Bauer, 2000; Geiselmann, Linden, & Helmchen,
2001; Snowdon, 2001; Watson, Lewis, Kistler,
Amick, & Boustani, 2004). In the United States,
around 15% of the older adults are expected to
present subthreshold depression, which is defined as
depressive symptoms that fail to meet the full
diagnostic criteria for a major depression episode
(Judd, Schettler, & Akiskal, 2002). In contrast to
major depression, the prevalence of subsyndromal
depression seems to increase with advancing age
(D. Blazer & Williams, 1980; Ernst & Angst, 1995;
Lavretsky & Kumar, 2003; Tannock & Katona,
1995; VanItallie, 2005). Although the number and
severity of symptoms are lower than those in the full-
blown syndrome, subsyndromal depression is asso-
ciated with significant functional impairment and
psychosocial disability (Penninx, Leveille, Ferrucci,
van Eijk, & Guralnik, 1999; Wilms, Kanowski, &
Baltes, 2000), an increased risk of developing major
depression at some point, and suicidal ideation
(Geiselmann & Bauer; Greden, 2001; VanItallie).
However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on
the impact that subthreshold depression may have on
quality of life or attitudes toward aging.
The brief version of the World Health Organiza-
tion Quality of Life (WHOQOL) instrument, known
as the WHOQOL-BREF instrument, is a generic
measurement of quality of life (the WHOQOL
Group, 1998). Its development was based on a trans-
cultural simultaneous methodology (Bullinger, Power,
Aaronson, Cella, & Anderson, 1996; Guillemin,
1995), which ensures its applicability in different
cultural settings. Recent reports have described its
satisfactory psychometric properties in older adult
populations (Chachamovich et al., 2007; Hwang,
Liang, Chiu, & Lin, 2003). In addition, the WHOQOL
Assessment for Older Adults (WHOQOL-OLD) and
the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire (AAQ) instru-
ments have been recently developed to provide more
reliable and comprehensive tools in assessing quality
of life and attitudes toward aging in older adults
(Laidlaw, Power, & Schmidt, 2007; Power et al.,
2005). They are in line with the need of broader
conceptual outcome measures, beyond the classic
ones, such as mortality and morbidity. Because they
were developed as specific instruments for elderly
individuals, particular attention was paid to guar-
antee that the specificities of old age would be
properly covered by the instruments. Both instru-
ments were developed with the use of a combination
of classical and modern psychometric approaches,
which ensures that the instruments have satisfactory
psychometric performance (Laidlaw et al.; Power
et al.). The WHOQOL Group recommends that the
WHOQOL-OLD module be applied together with
one generic quality of life instrument (WHOQOL-
100 or WHOQOL-BREF) to enhance its validity
(Power et al.).
Our aim in this study is to assess the association
of depression symptoms on the quality of life and
attitudes toward aging in a large international sam-
ple of older adults. Furthermore, we explore to what
extent subclinical depression symptoms also deter-
mine alterations in the quality of life and attitudes
toward aging in this population.
Methods
Participants
We obtained data from a larger study on quality
of life in older adults (WHOQOL-OLD). This
project was carried out by the WHOQOL Group
and involved 20 countries around the world (Power
et al., 2005).
Researchers recruited opportunistic samples of
individuals in participant centers across Europe,
Asia, South America, and North America. A total of
4,316 adults aged 60 years old or older were
interviewed and completed the 15-item Geriatric
Depression Scale (GDS), WHOQOL-OLD, AAQ,
and a sociodemographic form. Researchers carried
out the recruitment in university hospitals, nursing
homes, and in community groups for older adults.
Procedures
The assessment was run in a cross-sectional
design. As we already mentioned, the participants
were required to complete a sociodemographic form,
the 15-item GDS (Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986) the
WHOQOL-BREF instrument (the WHOQOL
Group, 1998), the WHOQOL-OLD module (Power
et al., 2005), and the AAQ (Laidlaw et al., 2007).
The GDS is a widely used instrument for assessing
depression specifically in older adults. Its theoretical
background is based on the ability to distinguish
depressed elders from the ones with ``normal aging''
neurovegetative symptoms. Thus, the GDS focuses
on nonsomatic symptomatology, emphasizing the
affective and cognitive areas (de Craen, Heeren, &
Gussekloo, 2003; McDonald et al., 2006; Yesavage
et al., 1982). It has yet to be cross-nationally validated
(this issue is currently being addressed elsewhere).
594 The Gerontologist
Thus, each center has applied a nationally validated
version. The optimal cutoff score of 5/6 presents
satisfactory sensitivity and specificity (Almeida &
Almeida, 1999; Rinaldi et al., 2003; Sutcliffe et al.,
2000; Wancata, Alexandrowicz, Marquart, Weiss, &
Friedrich, 2006), although alternative cutoff points
have been suggested for specific conditions (Cullum,
Tucker, Todd, & Brayne, 2006; Lim et al., 2000;
Malakouti, Fatollahi, Mirabzadeh, Salavati, &
Zandi, 2006). Because the instrument has yet to be
internationally validated, its cutoff point is not
consensual. For the present study, we adopted the
5/6 cutoff point.
The WHOQOL-BREF instrument is a generic
questionnaire to assess quality of life. Developed
under a simultaneous transcultural approach
(Bullinger et al., 1996; Guillemin, 1995), it is suitable
for multicentric studies and is also validated for
older adults (Chachamovich et al., 2007; Hwang
et al., 2003; Naumann & Byrne, 2004). It is com-
posed of four domains (physical, psychological,
social, and environmental) and an overall score.
The WHOQOL-OLD module is a specific com-
plementary set of items recently developed to
increase the specificity of the quality of life mea-
surement in older adults (Power et al., 2005). It
comprises six domains (sensory abilities, autonomy,
past, present, and future activities, social participa-
tion, death and dying, and intimacy) and an overall
score. Furthermore, it proved to be suitable and
adequate to measuring quality of life comprehen-
sively in older adults, because an intense qualitative
phase ensured that relevant issues were properly
covered by this instrument (Chachamovich et al.,
2007; Power et al.).
The AAQ is an instrument developed by the
WHOQOL Group to assess the subjective perception
of aging. It also followed a transcultural methodol-
ogy and shows good psychometric performance
(Laidlaw et al., 2007). It is composed of three facets
(psychological growth, physical change, and psycho-
social loss) and was also based in an intense
theoretical debate among international experts, as
well as in focus groups carried out with older adults
to confirm or adjust the instrument items. It is also
able to assess attitudes toward aging from the
perspective of the elderly population, which is the
one researchers consider to be the most capable of
informing them about the experience of aging.
Statistical Analysis
We ran our statistical analyses by using SPSS 14.0
software. We analyzed the total sample through
descriptive statistics for both clinical and subsyn-
dromal depression. If we found the distribution of
demographic variables to be significantly different,
then we ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to
partial out the variance for which other predictors
(age, educational level, gender, and marital status)
could account (Field, 2005). We carried out
independent t tests to compare the quality of life
and attitudes toward aging scores according to the
predictors.
We applied hierarchical regression in each domain
of the WHOQOL-OLD, WHOQOL-BREF, and
AAQ instruments to detect the impact of depression.
We included age, gender, educational level, and
marital status as independent variables, together
with depression levels.
Next, we selected the subsample of individuals
with subsyndromal depression levels and divided
them into two groups (one with GDS scores from
0 to 2, and another with scores from 3 to 5). We
based this cutoff on the median of the GDS score
distribution. Again, we applied demographic distri-
bution verification and ANCOVA to ensure compa-
rability. We ran independent t tests for each domain.
At this stage, these comparisons had the aim of
detecting the impact of small increases in depression
scores even at a subsyndromic level. We also carried
out a hierarchical regression to detect the relative
weight of subsyndromic depression on quality of life
and attitudes toward aging.
Results are described through means and proba-
bility or p values (chi-square and t tests), and
squared multiple correlation or R2 changes and
standardized beta or b values (for hierarchical
multiple linear regression).
Results
Descriptives
Researchers assessed 4,316 respondents. The
sample was predominantly comprised of highly
educated married women. Researchers carried out
recruitment primarily in homes (76.6%), followed by
community sites (14.7%) and hospitals (8.7%). We
found no relevant correlation between the site of
recruitment and the domain scores for quality of life
or attitudes toward aging (Pearson coefficients from
0.065 to 0.155). Table 1 describes the demographic
characteristics of the total sample divided into
a subsyndromal group and a clinical depression
group. There is a marked predominance of respond-
ents with depression scores lower than the diagnostic
cutoff point (73.84%).
We compared the WHOQOL-BREF, WHOQOL-
OLD, and AAQ domain scores across the clinically
depressed and the subsyndromic groups. All scores
for quality of life and attitudes toward aging are
significantly lower in the depressed group than in the
subsyndromic group (p , .001; data not shown).
These findings point out a wide and intense associa-
tion of major depression in quality of life outcomes.
This association, however, could be partially
related to the discrepancy in the distribution of
demographics. To control this potential bias, we ran
Vol. 48, No. 5, 2008 595
an ANCOVA. Table 2 describes the ANCOVA
results. As shown in this table, the interaction among
these variables assumes statistical significance in only
4 out of the 16 scores. Furthermore, the interaction
explains not more than 3% of the total variance of
the score in these four domains. Thus, the difference
in scores for quality of life and attitudes toward
aging between the two samples appears to be
strongly related to depression levels, and not to
demographic dissimilarities.
We tested potential multicollinearity through the
variance inflation factor in each regression model.
Variance inflation factor values ranged from 0.903 to
1.09, which indicates that the predictors do not have
strong linear relationships among them (Field, 2005;
Hair, Tatham, & Black, 1998).
We conducted a hierarchical multiple linear
regression to detect the increase of the coefficient
of determination as new independent variables were
included in the model. We evaluated the data
distribution by means of the Kolmogorov­Smirnov
test, which showed a normal distribution of all
dependent variables (WHOQOL and AAQ domains
scores). We also checked linearity and variance and
these met the linear regression assumptions. We
selected gender, age, marital status, and educational
level to compose the regression model, together with
depression levels, because they represent important
demographic variables and are widely reported in
several studies (Chan et al., 2006; Low & Molzahn,
2007). We also examined the standardized beta co-
efficients to compare the impact of the independent
variables in the quality of life and attitudes toward
aging domains. Tables 3 and 4 illustrate the R2
increase and the beta coefficients for each domain, as
well as for the overall scores in the three scales.
The inclusion of depression in the model deter-
mined a marked increase in the coefficient of deter-
mination. In fact, almost all of the variance is

explained by depression. The magnitude of the effect
caused by depression in the model is greatly higher
than the ones by the other variables, as we can see by
both the R2 change and the beta coefficients.
Interestingly, the domains of death and dying and
psychological growth seem to be less related to
depression. In fact, the proposed model explains only
8.4% and 7.3% of the total variance, respectively. As
we expected, depression is negatively associated with
all scores in different intensities.
Besides testing the association of major depression
on quality of life and attitudes toward aging, we also
explored the subsyndromal symptomatology. Our
main objective in these further analyses was to
investigate whether an increase of depression levels
can be related to impairments in quality of life and
attitudes toward aging, even when they are not
considered clinically relevant.
We selected a subsample of 3,187 respondents
from the total sample. We included all respondents
with GDS scores of 5 or lower in this analysis stage.
To test the effect of subsyndromal depression in the
WHOQOL and AAQ scores, we divided the sample
into two groups. The first group was composed of
1,782 respondents with GDS scores equal to or lower
than 2. The second group included respondents with
GDS scores from 3 to 5. Demographics are described
in Table 5.
We tested demographic variables through the use
of chi-square and independent t test statistics.
Following the same strategy applied for the total
sample and as already described, we used an
ANCOVA test to assess a potential effect of this
different distribution. Results indicated that the
interaction among gender, educational level, and
marital status is not significant for any domain.
Partial eta-squared values were 0% for all 16 scores
(data not shown).
Table 6 shows the comparison of mean scores for
all domains. It is possible to observe that the quality
of life and attitudes toward aging scores are
significantly decreased as depression levels are
increased.
In fact, the analysis of the scores of all domains
indicates a progressive impairment with increasing
depression levels, even when nonclinical depression
is included. Figure 1 illustrates the decreasing quality
of life and AAQ overall scores in four different levels
of depressive symptoms. An analysis of variance
showed that the differences are statistically signifi-
cant at all points (p , .0001). In addition, it seems
that the AAQ scores are less intensely associated

with the increase of depression levels when com-
pared with the quality of life scores.
We also applied a hierarchical multiple linear
regression in this subsample. Again, we assessed the
increase in the coefficient of determination, as well as
the standardized beta coefficients. As we expected,
the variances of the domain scores were lower than
the one observed in the total sample. As a result,
total R2 and changes in the coefficient were smaller.
The results indicate the same pattern observed in
the findings from the total sample. Again, the
magnitude of the effect caused by the inclusion of
depression in the model is much higher than the ones
caused by the other variables. This suggests that
a slight increase in depression level (in a subsyndro-
mal scenario) is a major predictor of impairments in
quality of life and attitudes toward aging.
The psychological growth and the death and
dying domains again showed a low coefficient of
determination. However, most of this low value was
due to depression rather than any other independent
variable in the model. Tables 7 and 8 describe the
hierarchical regression findings.
Discussion
In this study we aimed at exploring the association
of clinical and subclinical depression in the quality of
life and attitudes toward aging in a large interna-
tional sample of older adults. The results suggest
that even relatively minor levels of depression are
associated with a significant decrease in quality of
life and with a pattern of negative attitudes toward
aging. These findings assume particular relevance
because the instruments that were used are indeed
adequate for investigations in older adults. This
ensures the reliability of the results. Furthermore, the
large international sample could be seen as an
important factor of external validity.
Studies regarding attitudes toward aging have
demonstrated the effect of culture in the perception
of aging. Interestingly, stereotypes of aging proved
not to be adequate to describe the aging process
(Yun & Lachman, 2006). Quality of life is also
intimately linked to cultural aspects, because culture
and value systems of the society are part of the
quality of life definition (Schmidt & Bullinger, 2003;
the WHOQOL Group, 1998). The AAQ and the
WHOQOL instruments were constructed under
a simultaneous methodology, which included input
from several cultural contexts in the development
phase. Thus, they seem to represent what Draper
calls a ``culture-proof variable,'' because they are
able to assess meaningfully abstract concepts
(Draper, 2007).
Researchers have yet to explore the link between
quality of life and attitudes toward aging. Some
similarities should be highlighted. First, both
concepts are predominately based on subjective

perception rather than objective conditions. Second,
both are multidimensional and include physical and
psychological aspects. Nevertheless, it is possible to
state that the AAQ assesses a more stable perception,
whereas the WHOQOL instrument would be related
to a more circumstantial aspect. The combination of
the WHOQOL-OLD and the AAQ is suggested as an
effective methodology for assessing psychological or
psychiatric interventions (Laidlaw et al., 2007).
The sequential comparisons of the mean scores of
quality of life and attitudes toward aging domains
indicate progressive impairment on both outcomes
with increasing depression levels. This finding is
clinically relevant and is in line with the findings
from a series of recent studies (Chan et al., 2006;
Netuveli et al., 2006; Sobocki et al., 2007; Stafford
et al., 2007). However, to our knowledge, the con-
sistent result of impairment in all quality of life and
AAQ domains with a slight increase in depression
levels (in a subsyndromal stage) has not yet been
reported. When analyzed as a whole, the present
results show that there is a decrease in quality of
life and AAQ as depression levels increase. This
phenomenon happens not only for the clinically
depressed respondents (i.e., respondents with 6 to 9
symptoms and respondents with 10 or more symp-
toms on the GDS) but also for subsyndromic
respondents.
Thus, findings suggest that classifying a person as
nondepressed is not sufficient and is still not
informative about his or her quality of life and
attitudes toward aging status. Historically, depres-
sion has been underdiagnosed and undertreated in
later life (Alexopoulos, 2005), and this is evidently
more likely to occur if a person does not meet
diagnostic criteria (Jeste, Blazer, & First, 2005).
These results would raise the hypothesis that
subsyndromal depression could be treated because
of the impact of minor scores on the GDS on
appraisals of aging and quality of life. The potential
increase in the quality of life and attitudes toward
aging of patients treated for subsyndromic depres-
sion symptomatology appears as a question to be
further addressed in longitudinal studies.
The hierarchical multiple regressions produced
some interesting results. First, depression accounted
for the vast majority of coefficients of determination
in all domains. The standardized beta coefficients
also showed a high difference of magnitude between
depression and age, gender, marital status, and
educational level. Furthermore, depression was the
only predictor with significant values for all out-
comes in both total and subsyndromal samples. In
fact, depression has been described as the pre-
dominant factor contributing to morale (Woo,
Ho, & Wong, 2005), as well as the strongest
predictor for subjective perception of quality of life
(Chan et al., 2006; Demura & Sato, 2003). The
present findings corroborate these previously re-
ported results.

600 The Gerontologist
Second, there is a marked difference in the extent
to which the regression model explained the scores
variances. It is suggested that moderate coefficients
of determination are expected for models including
quality of life because it is a wide and comprehensive
construct, which would require complex models to
provide adequate explanation (Bowling, Banister,
Sutton, Evans, & Windsor, 2002). For example,
recent studies using linear regression methodology
on quality of life reported model R2 values of .568
(Low & Molzahn, 2007) and .475 (Netuveli et al.,
2006). Because the model applied in the present
study is simpler than the ones just cited, we would
expect the R2 values to be lower. In fact, the values
in the present study ranged from .214 to .476 (with
the exception of death and dying and psychological
growth) in the total sample. These values are
considered sizeable given the complex nature of the
dependent variables (Bowling et al.).
In contrast, the coefficient of determination was
markedly smaller for the death and dying and
psychological growth domains, which suggests that
there may be other important and specific factors
that account for the variation in these areas. Our
data were not able to address this question, though.
It is important to note that the death and dying
domain seems to present some potential psychometric
weaknesses, as demonstrated by other reports
(Chachamovich et al., 2007; Power et al., 2005).
We hypothesize that this domain would perform
better when it is applied to unhealthy subjects but
would lose power when healthy subjects are included
in the sample. Studies on quality of life in HIV
patients have supported this hypothesis (O'Connell,
Skevington, & Saxena, 2003; O'Connell, Saxena, &
Skevington, 2004).
Regarding the psychological growth domain, the
only article published up to the present that we know
of describes its satisfactory psychometric perfor-
mance in an international data set (Laidlaw et al.,
2007), which indicates that there must be another
cluster of variables for determining psychological
growth, and that these variables are more specific for
this domain. A close look at the eight items included
in this domain suggests that generativity is one major
topic (i.e., passing on the benefits of growing older,
giving good examples to younger people; see Laidlaw
et al.). It is possible to hypothesize that older adults
without the opportunity to be in contact with
younger generations (e.g., without children or grand-
children) may not be adequately represented by this
domain. It is extremely relevant to design inves-
tigations on this topic in order to implement specific
interventions to improve psychological aspects of
growing older.
As we predicted, the same model produced lower
coefficients of determination in the subsyndromal
sample. However, the results shown for the total sam-
ple (i.e., elevated and significant standardized beta
coefficients for depression in all domains and the
pattern of R2 values) remained similar for the sub-
syndromic sample. This finding reinforces the role of
even minimal depression levels in the WHOQOL and
AAQ domain scores. The question that arises from
these findings wouldbe whetheroffering treatment for
subsyndromal patients (either psychopharmacologi-
cal or psychotherapy) could improve their quality of
life and attitudes toward aging. Studies designed
specifically to address this issue are needed.
There are some limitations in the present study.
The cross-sectional design does not allow inference
of causality. Thus, it is possible to detect an
association between depression and WHOQOL
and AAQ scores, but not to state that the latter is
caused by the former. Longitudinal studies are
required to address this issue. In addition, clinical
or structured psychiatric interviews were not used to
provide a clinical diagnosis of depression. However,
the GDS was chosen because it has been extensively
studied for diagnostic purposes. Furthermore, we
decided to use level of depression rather than the
clinical diagnosis of depression in the analysis to
avoid this potential bias. It is also important to
observe that the tested model did not include other
demographic, clinical, and social variables, which
could be potentially related to depression and quality
of life (such as impaired functioning, life stressors,
social support, and physical health). These non-
evaluated variables may play a role in the relation-
ship between depression levels and quality of life.
In summary, the present study showed that an
increase in levels of depression, both in clinical and
subsyndromic stages, is a major predictor of impair-
ments in quality of life and attitudes toward aging
for older adults.
