Introduction
Moderators of Mind-Body Interventions
Despite the large number of behavioral intervention studies
for individuals diagnosed with cancer, the overall efficacy of
these treatments in addressing patient symptom burden has
been heavily debated.1-5 Though an estimated 20%-40% of
cancer patients experience depression, the typical cancer
patient enrolled in psychosocial trials tends to be not
depressed.4,6 Thus, the frequently used "all-comers" approach
to patient recruitment may result in negligible treatment gains
for quality of life (QOL) indicators such as depression. In fact,
a recent meta-analysis of 61 trials demonstrated that

Abstract
Hypothesis. This study examines moderators and mediators of a yoga intervention targeting quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes in
women with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy.Methods. Women undergoing 6 weeks of radiotherapy were randomized
to a yoga (YG; n = 53) or stretching (ST; n = 56) intervention or a waitlist control group (WL; n = 54). Depressive symptoms
and sleep disturbances were measured at baseline. Mediator (posttraumatic stress symptoms, benefit finding, and cortisol
slope) and outcome (36-item Short Form [SF]-36 mental and physical component scales [MCS and PCS]) variables were
assessed at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 1-, 3-, and 6-months posttreatment. Results. Baseline depressive symptoms
(P = .03) and sleep disturbances (P < .01) moderated the Group × Time effect on MCS, but not PCS. Women with high
baseline depressive symptoms in YG reported marginally higher 3-month MCS than their counterparts in WL (P = .11).
Women with high baseline sleep disturbances in YG reported higher 3-months MCS than their counterparts in WL (P < .01)
and higher 6-month MCS than their counterparts in ST (P = .01). YG led to greater benefit finding than ST and WL across
the follow-up (P = .01). Three-month benefit finding partially mediated the effect of YG on 6-month PCS. Posttraumatic
stress symptoms and cortisol slope did not mediate treatment effect on QOL. Conclusion. Yoga may provide the greatest
mental-health­related QOL benefits for those experiencing pre-radiotherapy sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms.
Yoga may improve physical-health­related QOL by increasing ability to find benefit in the cancer experience.

psychological distress moderated the efficacy of psychosocial
treatments regarding mood management for cancer patients.7
Furthermore, a meta-analysis of trials targeting depressed
cancer patients indicated that psychotherapeutic and pharma-
cological interventions are effective in reducing depressive
symptoms with sustained effects.8
Although these meta-analyses have been instrumental in
identifying the importance of examining moderators of treat-
ment efficacy, they have rarely included trials of complemen-
tary medicine interventions such as yoga and meditation.
Such exclusion is surprising in light of the rapid proliferation
of Eastern-influenced behavioral interventions in oncology
research and practice.9-17 Yoga in particular has gained popu-
larity in the cancer setting, and several systematic reviews
and meta-analyses have examined the QOL benefits associ-
ated with cancer patients' and survivors' yoga practice.14-17
For instance, a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) of yoga in cancer patients and survivors revealed
large effects for psychological health; medium effects for
fatigue, general QOL, and psychosocial well-being; and
small effects for sleep disturbances and physical function.17 It
is important to note that the reviewed trials did not select for
elevated symptom burden (ie, used an "all-comer" approach).
Thus, yoga may lead to even greater grains in at-risk partici-
pants. However, with the exception of some limited evi-
dence,18 it is largely unknown if patients with elevated
distress derive greater QOL benefit from a yoga intervention
compared with their less-distressed counterparts.
The benefits of yoga are multifaceted, targeting not only
psychological but also physical and spiritual dimensions of
QOL.17 Thus, participant characteristics beyond psycho-
logical distress may moderate the efficacy of a yoga inter-
vention. Sleep disturbances, potentially caused by the
cancer process itself or cancer treatments, are commonly
experienced among women with breast cancer19-21 and are
associated with impaired QOL in cancer patients even when
controlling for depression and fatigue.20,22,23 Because yoga
is an effective treatment to improve sleep in cancer patients
and survivors,9,24,25 it may be particularly efficacious for
patients reporting high levels of sleep disturbances. In fact,
a multicenter RCT involving 410 survivors with moderate
to high sleep disturbances demonstrated that an 8-session
yoga intervention improved self-reported and actigraphy-
assessed sleep relative to standard care.9 However, to the
best of our knowledge, sleep disturbances have not yet been
examined as a yoga intervention moderator.
Mediators of Mind-Body Interventions
In addition to lacking a clear understanding of for whom
mind-body interventions are most helpful, no cohesive the-
oretical framework has been proposed to explain how and
why yoga interventions produce change.26,27 A recent sys-
tematic review reports that few potential mechanisms of
yoga have been explored to date, and no mechanisms of
yoga have been tested in cancer populations.28,29 The excep-
tion is one study on mindfulness-based stress reduction for
cancer patients, which includes some yoga. This study
found that increasing mindfulness partially mediated the
intervention's beneficial effects on stress and posttraumatic
avoidance.30 However, in light of the growing RCTs exam-
ining yoga in cancer and the limited exploration of media-
tors of this intervention, further examination of yoga
mediators guided by a conceptual model is needed.
We propose a stress response model as a way to under-
stand how yoga produces change in cancer patients. A diag-
nosis of cancer and its treatment are typically experienced
as stressful, or even traumatic, events, and yoga interven-
tions are generally conceptualized within the framework of
a stress reduction program. Thus, practicing yoga may
improve health outcomes in cancer patients via modulating
the stress response.28 Put another way, yoga may affect
posttraumatic stress symptoms, such as cognitive interfer-
ence and avoidance, while also increasing posttraumatic
growth or benefit finding. Importantly, both constructs of
trauma response (ie, posttraumatic stress symptoms and
benefit finding) have been consistently and prospectively
associated with psychological and physical QOL outcomes
in various cancer samples.31-39
With this model in mind, we previously examined the
effects of yoga versus usual care on intrusive thoughts/
avoidance behaviors and benefit finding in a small pilot trial
in women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy.10
Differences between groups in benefit finding did not
emerge until the last 3-month assessment time point, pre-
cluding the examination of benefit finding as an interven-
tion mediator. Surprisingly, the yoga group reported
increased intrusive thoughts 1 month after the end of radio-
therapy compared with the women in the usual care group,
with subsequent reduction at the 3-month time point, and
nonsignificant reductions in avoidance behaviors.
Interestingly, intrusive thoughts at 1 month were positively
associated with benefit finding at 3 months. There is some
evidence to suggest that heightened levels of intrusive
thoughts experienced during the aftermath of a traumatic
event may help individuals more effectively adjust to the
stressor and ultimately to find benefit in the traumatic expe-
rience.40 Thus, the increase in intrusive thoughts associated
with yoga may have led to better, more mindful processing
of the cancer experience, ultimately fostering finding mean-
ing in the cancer experience.
Moreover, within a trauma response model, cortisol
rhythmicity may represent one biological pathway by which
mind-body interventions improve health and well-being.
Both types of trauma response (posttraumatic stress symp-
toms and benefit finding) are associated with hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis function in cancer patients, which in
turn is associated with behavioral symptoms (eg, fatigue,
252 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
sleep disturbance, and depression), making changes to cor-
tisol rhythmicity a potential mechanism of yoga.41-44
Although previous studies have shown group main effects
of a yoga intervention on diurnal cortisol and speculated a
mediating effect, no empirical evidence exists to date.28
The Present Study
The goal of the current study was to examine moderators
and mediators of a previously reported 3-arm yoga RCT for
women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing radiother-
apy.45 We focused only on mediators and moderators of the
primary outcome variable: health-related QOL. First, we
hypothesized that, compared with active and waitlist con-
trol groups, the yoga program would be especially benefi-
cial at improving posttreatment QOL for women with
elevated pretreatment depressive symptoms and sleep dis-
turbance. Second, we hypothesized that the beneficial QOL
effects of the intervention would be mediated by improved
trauma responses (ie, short-term increases in intrusive
thoughts and reduction in avoidance behaviors and increased
benefit finding) as well as better stress hormone regulation
(ie, a steeper cortisol slope).
Method
Participants
Women were recruited prior to radiotherapy treatment
(XRT), with inclusion criteria being the following: 18
years old; ability to read, write, and speak English; diag-
nosed with stage 0 to III breast cancer; and scheduled to
undergo daily adjuvant XRT for 6 weeks at MD Anderson
Cancer Center. Patients with lymphedema, metastatic bone
disease, deep-vein thrombosis, documented diagnosis of a
formal thought disorder, and extreme mobility problems or
those who had practiced yoga in the year before diagnosis
were excluded. The protocol was approved by the institu-
tional review board.
Procedures
Details of the study procedures have been reported else-
where.45 Briefly, after receiving written informed consent,
self-report and saliva samples (for cortisol data) were col-
lected from participants at baseline before randomization,
during the last week of XRT, and 1, 3, and 6 months later.
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups:
(1) yoga (YG); (2) stretching control (ST); or waitlist con-
trol (WL) using a form of adaptive randomization,46 accord-
ing to age, stage of disease, time since diagnosis, type of
surgery, and chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant).
Participants in the WL group received usual care, completed
all assessments on the same timeline as the active groups,
and were offered yoga classes at the end of their study par-
ticipation. All participants were asked to refrain from par-
ticipating in any other yoga classes while on study.
Participants in the YG and ST groups attended up to three
60-minute classes per week during their 6 weeks of XRT.
Each participant received an audio CD and a written manual
of the program to encourage at-home practice.
The integrated yoga program, described previously,10
included the following: (1) preparatory warm-up synchro-
nized with breathing; (2) selected postures, or asanas (for-
ward-, backward-, and side-bending asanas in sitting and
standing positions, cobra posture, crocodile, and half-
shoulder-stand with support); (3) deep relaxation (supine
posture); (4) alternate-nostril breathing or pranayama; and
(5) meditation. The program was taught by Vivekananda
Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana­trained teachers with spe-
cific oncology training.
The stretching program included exercises recom-
mended specifically for women undergoing or recovering
from breast cancer treatment.47,48 The exercises approxi-
mated the gross movements of the yoga exercises and were
taught by cancer center physiotherapists.
Measures
Primary Intervention Outcome: Health-Related QOL.Overall
QOL was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item
Short Form survey (SF-36) and was the primary outcome of
the clinical trial published previously.45 The SF-36 assesses
physical functioning, physical impediments to role func-
tioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality,
social functioning, emotional impediments to role function-
ing, and mental health and includes an overall physical and
mental component scale (PCS and MCS).49,50 To reduce the
number of analyses, only the component scales are included
in outcome analyses. Higher scores reflect better QOL.
Proposed Moderators. Depressive symptoms were assessed
using the Centers for Epidemiological Studies­Depression
measures (CES-D),51 a well-validated measure focusing on
affective components of depression. Lower scores reflect
fewer depressive symptoms. In this study sample, the inter-
nal reliability was high (Cronbach's  = .89).
Sleep disturbances were assessed using the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),52 a questionnaire that assesses
sleep disturbances over a 1-month period. We report on the
total score, with lower scores reflecting fewer sleep distur-
bances. Acceptable internal reliability was found in this
study sample (Cronbach's  = .70).
Proposed Mediators: Posttraumatic Responses.Posttraumatic
stress symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event
Scale (IES), a scale that assesses the 2 most common catego-
ries of responses to traumatic events: intrusion (intrusively
Ratcliff et al 253
experienced ideas, images, feelings, or bad dreams) and
avoidance behaviors (conscious efforts to avoid certain
ideas, feelings, or situations).53 We report on the intrusive
thoughts and avoidance behaviors subscales and the total
score. Lower scores reflect fewer symptoms. Adequate
internal reliability was found for the total scale (Cronbach's
 = .85) as well as intrusive (Cronbach's  = .85) and avoid-
ance (Cronbach's  = .79) subscales.
Participants' ability to find benefit was measured by the
Benefit Finding Scale (BFS),54,55 a scale assessing accep-
tance of life's imperfections, change in priorities, and devel-
opment of a sense of purpose in life as a result of having
been diagnosed with cancer. Higher scores reflect greater
benefit finding. In this study sample, the internal reliability
was high (Cronbach's  = .94).
Cortisol Rhythmicity. Cortisol was obtained via 5 saliva sam-
ples (waking, 45 minutes later, approximately 8 and 12
hours after waking, and at bedtime) for 3 consecutive days
at each assessment. Participants chewed on a cotton swab
(Salivette) and placed it in a plastic tube (Sarstedt), which
was then frozen at -80°C for later time-resolved immuno-
assay with fluorescence detection performed at the Univer-
sity of Dresden. Values <0.0001 and >70 nmol/L were
classified as missing. If patients missed a collection point,
they were told to leave the tube empty. Reliability for each
collection time point within a day across the 3 days and the
5 assessment time points ranged from 0.20 to 0.87, with
only 6 out of 25  values (5 samples a day at 5 time points)
dropping below 0.50. Reliability was directly related to the
sample size, which dropped off by the 6-month follow-up.
A steeper, more-negative cortisol slope indicates better cor-
tisol regulation.
Covariates.
Patients also completed basic demographic
information (eg, age, marital status, education). Medical
information was obtained from electronic medical records.
Data Analyses
Hypothesis 1: To evaluate whether the intervention was
more effective in regard to health-related QOL (SF-36
MCS and PCS) for participants with high depressive symp-
toms (Hypothesis 1A) or greater sleep disturbance
(Hypothesis 1B) at baseline, we used an ANCOVA frame-
work to first examine the Group × Baseline moderator
effect using PROC MIXED in SAS v9.2. This was fol-
lowed by a Group × Time × Baseline moderator ANCOVA
to see if the moderator effect varied by time. We controlled
for the respective baseline outcome as well as randomiza-
tion factors (age, stage of disease, time since diagnosis,
type of surgery, and chemotherapy type). We also con-
trolled for baseline SF-36 general health scores in all anal-
yses as a result of imbalances across groups. We treated
time as a categorical variable and the intercept as a random
effect. We specified an unstructured covariance structure.
For significant 3-way interactions, we decomposed the
interaction according to high and low (mean ± ½SD) base-
line depressive symptoms or sleep disturbance and com-
pared the least-squared means (LSM) for each group at
each time point using a general linear model analysis, con-
trolling for baseline levels of the outcome variable and
illustrating the interaction by plotting the LSM.
Hypothesis 2: We were interested in determining media-
tors of significant group effects on health-related QOL. The
original trial45 demonstrated group differences in SF-36
PCS at 1 and 3 months, and a subscale of the SF-36 PCS
(physical functioning) at those time points and 6 months.
We chose to examine mediators of SF-36 PCS at 1, 3, and 6
months, rather than the physical functioning subscale
because the SF-36 PCS is a more comprehensive index of
physical health­related QOL.
To determine the mediator variables, we regressed each
proposed mediator (ie, IES, BFS, and cortisol slope) on
group, time, and the Group × Time interaction using the
model and covariates described above. Where there was a
group or Group × Time effect on the proposed mediator
variable, we chose the time point associated with the largest
group or Group × Time effect as the mediator. If a proposed
mediator variable did not significantly differ by group, it
was not further examined. Only primary outcome variables
assessed after our chosen mediators were included as
dependent variables in the mediation models to enable a
predictive relationship between the mediator and the depen-
dent variable to be established.56
To test for mediation, we calculated indirect effects using
Hayes and Preacher's bias-corrected bootstrap procedure
via the MEDIATE macro for SPSS, which is designed to
estimate indirect effects of multicategorical independent
variables.57 Indicator coding of the grouping variable was
used, with WL functioning as the reference group. D1 codes
the effect of YG compared with WL controlling for ST, and
D2 codes the effect of ST compared with WL controlling
for YG. Indirect effects were determined significant when
the mean of the indirect effect across all 5000 bootstrap
samples was associated with a bias-corrected confidence
interval that did not include 0.57
Results
Attrition and Adherence
Out of 294 eligible women approached, 191 consented to
participate; 13 dropped out before, and 15 after, randomiza-
tion, for a baseline sample size of 163 (YG = 53; ST = 56;
WL = 54). Measurements were obtained for 80% of the sam-
ple at 6 months (n = 131; YG = 43, ST = 42, WL =46; see
original clinical trial45 for CONSORT). Out of a maximum
254 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
possible 18 classes, 87% of YG and 85% of ST participants
attended 12 classes (YG = 13.8; ST = 14.7). Only 3 patients
in each group attended fewer than half the classes. There
were no significant differences in demographic, medical, or
baseline self-report scores between those who attended
75% of classes compared with those who did not. For the
YG group, self-reported practice outside of class was high
(twice per week) at 1 month posttreatment and then
declined at 3 and 6 months (71%, 55%, and 45%, respec-
tively). For the ST group, self-reported practice outside of
class (twice per week) was lower at 1 month and then
increased somewhat at 3 and 6 months (53%, 69%, and 60%,
respectively). WL participants were offered the YG program
after data collection was complete, but no data were col-
lected from the WL during or after yoga.
There were also no group, demographic, or baseline self-
report differences between those who completed the
6-month follow-up assessment and those who did not (Ps >
.14), with the exception that older adults were more likely
to complete the 6-month assessment.
Baseline Sample Characteristics
The 3 groups were similar on all medical and demographic
variables (Table 1). There were no statistically significant
differences among the groups on any of the self-reported
variables at baseline, apart from the SF-36 general health
subscale. Women in YG reported lower baseline general
health compared with those in ST (P = .01). Depending on
the time point, 21% to 34% of participants did not provide
saliva samples. There were no differences between patients
providing samples and those who did not based on group
assignment, medical, demographic, or outcome measures.
We present the baseline and follow-up means of self-
reported variables in Table 2.
Hypothesis 1: Baseline Depressive Symptoms
and Sleep Disturbance as Moderators of
Intervention Outcomes
There were no significant Group × Baseline Depressive
Symptom (CES-D) interaction effects on mental health­
related QOL (SF-36 MCS). However, there was a signifi-
cant Group × Time × Baseline CES-D interaction effect on
SF-36 MCS (F
(6, 324)
= 2.40; P < .03), suggesting that the
effect varied by time. We decomposed the interaction
according to high and low (mean ± ½SD) baseline CES-D
scores. There were no statistically significant differences in
SF-36 MCS scores between groups for those with low or
high baseline depressive symptoms at any assessment point
(Figure 1A). However, women with high baseline depres-
sive symptoms in YG had a trend toward higher SF-36
MCS scores at 3 months compared with WL (P = .107), and
their 1-, 3-, and 6-month SF-36 MCS scores were no differ-
ent from those of women scoring low on baseline depres-
sive symptoms. There were no significant Group × Baseline
CES-D or Group × Time × Baseline CES-D interaction
effects on physical health­related QOL (SF-36 PCS).
There was no significant Group × Baseline sleep distur-
bance (PSQI) interaction effects on mental health­related
QOL (SF-36 MCS). However, there was a significant Group
× Time × Baseline PSQI interaction effect on SF-36 MCS
(F
(6, 318)
= 3.40, P < .01). We decomposed the interaction
according to high and low (mean ± ½SD) baseline PSQI
scores. There were no significant differences in SF-36 MCS
scores between groups for those with low baseline sleep
disturbances at any assessment point (Figure 1B). However,
among the women with high baseline sleep disturbances,
there was a significant Group × Time effect (F
(6, 83)
= 3.52;
P = .003). Specifically, women with high sleep disturbances
in YG reported higher 3-month SF-36 MCS scores than
their counterparts in WL (t
(83)
= 3.15; P = .002) and higher
6-month SF-36 MCS scores than their counterparts in ST
(t
(83)
= 2.56; P = .012), and their SF-36 MCS scores at each
time point were no different from that of women reporting
low sleep disturbance at baseline. There were no significant
Group × Baseline sleep disturbance (PSQI) or Group ×
Time × Sleep disturbance (PSQI) interaction effects on
physical health­related QOL (SF-36 PCS).
Hypothesis 2: Mediators of Intervention Effect
on QOL
Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms. Results revealed no signifi-
cant Group × Time interaction effect on IES total scale,
intrusive thoughts, or avoidance behaviors subscales scores
(Ps > .5). Additionally, there were no main effects of group
or time on the IES total scale or intrusive thoughts subscale
(Ps > .2). There was a main effect of group (F
(2,132)
= 3.17;
P = .05), but not time (P = .6), for the IES avoidance sub-
scale. Specifically, YG was associated with greater IES
avoidance scores (LSM = 11.31; SE = 0.82) compared with
WL (LSM = 8.52; SE = 0.76; P = .01). IES avoidance scores
did not differ between ST (LSM = 10.16; SE = 0.79) and
YG or WL (Ps > .1). Figure 2A presents LSMs of IES
avoidance for groups across time.
The time point at which groups differed most on IES
avoidance was at 6 months (F
(2, 112)
= 3.23; P = .04; Cohen's
d = 0.40), with women in YG (LSM = 11.29; SE = 1.18;
P = .02) and ST (LSM = 10.14; SE = 1.19; P = .09) reporting
greater IES avoidance scores compared with women in WL
(LSM = 7.34; SE = 1.69). Using the 6-month time point for
the mediator does not enable examining a temporal relation-
ship between the mediator and outcome, and there were no
significant group differences at earlier time points, precluding
examination of IES avoidance as an intervention mediator.
Ratcliff et al 255
Benefit Finding.Results revealed no significant Group ×
Time interaction effect on BFS scores (P = .9). However,
there was a main effect of group (F
(2,132)
= 4.60; P = .01) and
a main effect of time (F
(3,335)
= 3.12; P = .03) on benefit
finding. Specifically, YG was associated with greater bene-
fit finding (LSM = 46.21; SE = 1.28) compared with ST
(LSM = 42.24; SE = 1.23; P = .03) and WL (LSM = 41.05;
SE = 1.19; P < .01). Benefit finding did not differ between
ST and WL (P = .5). Figure 2B presents LSMs of benefit
finding for groups across time.
Women in YG reported higher levels on benefit finding
relative to WL at 1, 3, and 6 months and relative to ST at 3
and 6 months (Ps < .05), with no differences between ST
and WL. Groups differed most on benefit finding at 3
months (F(2, 103)
= 3.12; P = .05; Cohen's d = 0.38), with
women in YG reporting greater benefit finding scores (LSM
= 46.32; SE = 1.85) compared with ST (LSM = 40.90; SE =
1.78; P = .04) and WL (LSM = 40.57; SE = 1.69; P = .02).
Therefore, 3-month benefit finding was examined as a
mediator of group's effects on physical health­related QOL

(SF-36 PCS) at 6 months because the physical health sub-
scale of the SF-36 PCS was the only outcome associated
with group differences assessed after 3 months.
Hayes and Preacher's bias-corrected bootstrap test of
indirect effect57 revealed that group did indirectly affect
physical health­related QOL (SF-36 PCS) at 6 months via
benefit finding at 3 months (Figure 3). First, YG resulted in
higher 3-month benefit finding compared with WL (the a
1
pathway; P = .04), whereas ST and WL did not differ in
3-month benefit finding (the a
2
pathway; P = .84). Second,
holding group constant, those who reported higher benefit
finding at 3 months reported higher 6-month physical
health­related QOL (the b pathway, P = .04). Third, relative
to WL, women in YG reported higher 6-month physical
health­related QOL in part because of the positive effect of
YG on 3-month benefit finding. Indeed, a bootstrap esti-
mate of the indirect effect of YG compared with WL on
6-month physical health­related QOL via 3-month benefit
finding revealed a 95% bias-corrected and accelerated
(BCa) confidence interval that did not cross zero (B = 0.77;
SE = 0.58; CI = 0.01 and 2.58). Thus, 3-month benefit find-
ing partially mediated the effect of YG on 6-month physical
health­related QOL. Conversely, the BCa confidence inter-
val for the indirect effect of ST compared with WL did cross
zero and was, therefore, not significant (B = 0.07;
SE = 0.43; CI = -0.84 and 0.88). Thus, the effect of ST on
6-month physical health­related QOL was not mediated by
3-month benefit finding.
Cortisol. Results revealed no significant group or time effect
on cortisol slope (P > .3). There was a trend for a Group ×
Time interaction effect (F

cally, YG was associated with a steeper cortisol slope

compared with ST and WL (Ps < .03) immediately after
radiotherapy (post-XRT), and YG was associated with a
steeper cortisol slope compared with WL at 1 month (P =
.02). Figure 2C represents LSMs of cortisol slope for groups
at each time point. Because the effects of group and Group
× Time on cortisol slope did not reach significance, it was
not examined as a mediator.
Exploratory Analyses: Changes in IES and
Outcomes
Because women in WL reported unexpectedly lower IES
avoidance scores over time compared with women in YG,
we explored the association between changes in IES avoid-
ance and QOL outcomes by regressing group, change in
IES avoidance at 6 months (the time point associated with
significant group differences), and the interaction on QOL
outcome variables (physical and mental health­related
QOL (SF-36 PCS and MCS), depressive symptoms (CES-
D), and sleep disturbance (PSQI)) at the final follow-up
time point (ie, 6 months). There were significant interaction
effects for mental health­related QOL (P = .05) and depres-
sive symptoms (P = .04). Pearson correlations within each
group revealed no association between change in IES avoid-
ance scores and 6-month mental health­related QOL or
depressive symptoms for YG or ST, whereas a greater
increase in IES avoidance scores was associated with worse
6-month mental health­related QOL (r = -0.31; P = .03)
and higher depressive symptoms (r = 0.42; P < .01) for the
WL group.
Discussion
The present study hypothesized that participating in a yoga
intervention during radiotherapy would be particularly ben-
eficial for women with high baseline depressive symptoms
and sleep disturbances on posttreatment QOL compared
with their counterparts participating in stretching or waitlist
control groups. We also hypothesized that trauma responses
(ie, change in posttraumatic stress symptoms and increased
benefit finding) and better stress hormone regulation (ie,
steeper cortisol slope) would mediate the effect of yoga on
primary outcomes. Results partially supported each of the
hypotheses.
Consistent with previous research suggesting that cancer
patients with higher distress derive greater benefit from
psychosocial interventions,18,58-61 the yoga intervention pro-
vided the greatest mental health­related benefits for women
with elevated sleep disturbance and, to a lesser extent,
depressive symptoms prior to the start of radiotherapy. This
effect varied by time, with differences emerging especially
3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Thus, yoga was espe-
cially helpful for those women with disturbed sleep and
depressive symptoms at the start of radiotherapy. In fact, the
women in the yoga group who had sleep disturbances at
study entry had mental health scores at 3 and 6 months after
Figure 3. Yoga indirectly affects physical health­related QOL (SF-36 PCS) at the 6-month follow-up via increased benefit finding
(BFS) at 3 months. Values on each path are unstandardized path coefficients taken from bootstrapping analyses controlling for age,
stage of disease, time since diagnosis, type of surgery, chemotherapy type, and baseline benefit finding (BFS), physical health­related
QOL (SF-36 PCS), and the SF-36 general health subscale. The a
1
and a
2
paths correspond to the mean differences in 3-month BFS
between YG relative to WL and ST relative to WL, respectively. Thus, YG resulted in 3-month BFS scores that were a
1
= 5.55 units
higher than WL (P = .04), and ST resulted in BFS that were a
2
= 0.54 points higher than WL (P = .84). The b pathway corresponds to
the relation between 3-month BFS and 6-month SF-36 PCS when group is held constant. Thus, for every 1 point increase in 3-month
BFS, individuals reported an average b = 0.14-point increase in 6-month SF-36 PCS (P = .04). The relative indirect effects of group can
be determined by multiplying the a and b paths. Thus, relative to WL, YG resulted in SF-36 PCS scores that were a
1
b = 0.77 units
higher as a result of the positive effect of YG on BFS, which corresponds to a significant indirect effect of YG versus WL on 6-month
SF-36 PCS via 3-month BFS (B = 0.77; SE = 0.58; 95% bias-corrected and accelerated [BCa] CI = 0.01 and 2.58). Conversely, there was
no significant indirect effect of ST versus WL on 6-month SF-36 PCS via 3-month BFS (B = 0.07; SE = 0.43; BCa CI = -0.84 and 0.88).

radiotherapy equivalent to those of women who did not
have sleep disturbances at study entry. A similar pattern was
seen for the benefits of yoga for those with high depressive
symptoms at baseline.
Regarding our mediation hypotheses, yoga led to
increased benefit finding across the follow-up period rela-
tive to the stretching and waitlist control groups, where
there was consistent decrease over time. Importantly, we
found that yoga indirectly affected physical health­related
QOL assessed 6 months after radiotherapy via increased
benefit finding reported 3 months after radiotherapy. In
other words, part of the effect of yoga on physical health­
related QOL at the long-term follow-up can be attributed to
the increased benefit finding experienced by yoga partici-
pants midway through the follow-up period. Of note, the
longitudinal nature of the data enabled the time-lagged
mediation analyses, which are critical for determining
mechanisms of effect. This is a particular strength of the
present article because such mediation analyses are often
lacking in intervention study designs.
Surprisingly, women in the waitlist group reported less
avoidance behaviors (eg, "I tried not to think about it;" "I
stayed away from reminders about it") 6 months following
radiotherapy compared with women in the yoga group, who
reported little change in avoidance behaviors from baseline,
and there was no evidence of a decrease in intrusive thoughts
over time for any group. This finding was counter to our
hypotheses and that of other studies, which have found
mind-body practices in general, and yoga in particular, to be
associated with reductions in avoidance-related coping.62,63
However, exploratory analyses suggested that the typical
deleterious effect of avoidance behaviors on QOL64,65 was
not found for those in either of the active groups (yoga or
stretching) but remained for those in the waitlist group. This
finding was somewhat consistent with our previous pilot
trial, in which the yoga group reported short-term increases
in intrusive thoughts relative to the waitlist control group.10
Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Helgeson et al66 found that
increased intrusive or avoidant thoughts about a stressor
were associated with increase in benefit finding, which was
in turn associated with greater well-being. Thus, it could be
that yoga may not reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms (ie,
cognitive interference or avoidance) in the acute phase, but
this in turn may facilitate improved long-term adjustment.
There are several limitations to recognize in this study.
The majority of participants were white, non-Hispanic,
married, and highly educated. Thus, future research is
needed to test the generalizability of these findings to more
diverse populations. Participants also were not blinded to
study condition, and no measure of treatment expectation
was collected, which could have biased the findings because
of the subjective nature of the outcomes. In addition,
although these data suggest that women with elevated lev-
els of depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances show a
greater treatment response, these findings need to be inter-
preted with caution because the patients were not selected
based on pretreatment symptomatology. The study may
have also been underpowered for the mediation analyses. In
a study of empirical power simulations, Fritz and
MacKinnon67 indicated that very large sample sizes are
required for tests of mediation to be conducted with at least
80% power. Thus, the sample size of the present study
likely limits our ability to determine mediators with full
power, and the same limitation may be true for moderation
analyses. Additionally, the reduced reliability of cortisol
slopes assessed at later follow-up points (because of a
smaller sample size) may have limited our power to detect
the effects of cortisol slopes as a mediator in particular.
Finally, we followed participants for only a 6-month period,
so the long-term effectiveness of yoga in patients with
breast cancer remains to be determined. To address these
limitations, we are conducting an ongoing yoga trial using a
quasi-double-blinded design, with patients not knowing the
details of the intervention groups at baseline and then only
knowing the specifics of their assigned group. Additionally,
assessors are blind to group assignment. Treatment expecta-
tions are also being measured, and patients complete a
1-year follow-up assessment.
In conclusion, the current study provides a greater under-
standing of who will benefit most from a yoga intervention
and how a yoga intervention produces change. These results
suggest that future studies of the effect of yoga on cancer
patients may benefit from screening for participants who
report poor sleep or depressive symptoms because yoga may
buffer the negative effect of poor sleep or low mood on men-
tal health­related QOL indices in the months following
treatment for cancer. Additionally, these findings imply that
yoga may improve physical health­related QOL by increas-
ing one's ability to find benefit in the cancer experience.
Finally, yoga appears to increase women's endorsement of
symptoms typically associated with posttraumatic stress (ie,
intrusive thoughts and/or avoidance behaviors) but disasso-
ciates the typically harmful link between these symptoms
and QOL. Based on these results, we recommend that future
research continues to identify pretreatment psychosocial
factors that predict intervention response, seeks mechanisms
by which interventions work, and begins implementing tar-
geted, tailored, evidence-based mind-body interventions to
optimize recovery and QOL in patients affected by cancer.
