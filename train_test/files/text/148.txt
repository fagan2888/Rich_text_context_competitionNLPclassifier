Abstract
This paper aims to identify the determinants of portfolio restructuring in EMU member
states since the introduction of the euro and especially during the financial turbulence of
the past years. We find that, besides exchange rate volatility and traditional indicators of
information and transaction costs, the perception of sovereign risk has become more
important as a determinant of portfolio allocation. The shares of financial corporations
have been affected disproportionately by this development. At the same time, banks
substantially reduced their international investment, possibly the result of a deleveraging
process.

Non-technical summary
This paper analyses the development of the home bias in portfolio holdings of Germany
and other euro area countries focussing on equity securities. It ties in with the risk aspect of
home bias and tries to find out, whether the perception of risk related to foreign assets
differs with regard to investment outside and inside the euro area and with regard to
different sectors. Besides real exchange rate volatility, which can possibly explain the
regional orientation of investors, we are looking for additional aspects that might play a
role in market segmentation.
In doing so, we use two newly available detailed databases. The IMF's Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) allows exploring bilateral portfolio holdings. We find
that financial integration is decisively more advanced within European Monetary Union
(EMU) than between member countries and countries outside the euro area. This outcome
can partially be attributed to the abolition of exchange rate risk. Traditional indicators of
information and transaction costs have also play a role. Sovereign risks do not seem to
have affected investment in equity securities prior to the crisis.
The analysis of German deposit statistics reveals that the financial crisis had a clear impact
on the regional and sectoral structure of German portfolio holdings. Apparently, the shares
of financial corporations were affected disproportionately by reshuffling in security
portfolios. An important result is the fact that especially banks have substantially reduced
their investment abroad. These developments might be part of a deleveraging process that
has been triggered by the financial crisis.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Die vorliegende Untersuchung befasst sich mit der Entwicklung des Home Bias in
Deutschland und anderen Ländern der Europäischen Währungsunion. Dabei konzentrieren
wir uns auf Dividendenpapiere. Das Papier knüpft an die Risikoaspekte des Home Bias an
und versucht herauszufinden, ob sich die Risikoeinstellung gegenüber ausländischen
Wertpapieren in Hinblick auf Anlagen innerhalb und außerhalb der Währungsunion sowie
von Sektor zu Sektor unterscheidet. Neben Wechselkursvolatilität, die möglicherweise
regionale Präferenzen erklären kann, suchen wir nach zusätzlichen Aspekten, die für eine
mögliche Marktsegmentierung verantwortlich sein könnten.
Dafür verwenden wir zwei neue, detaillierte Datensätze. Der Coordinated Portfolio
Investment Survey (CPIS) des IWF erlaubt die Untersuchung bilateraler
Wertpapierbestände. Wir kommen zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Finanzmarktintegration
innerhalb der Europäischen Währungsunion (EWU) entschieden weiter fortgeschritten ist
als zwischen Mitgliedstaaten und Nichtmitgliedstaaten der EWU. Dieses Ergebnis kann
teilweise auf den Wegfall von Wechselkursrisiken zurückgeführt werden. Traditionelle
Indikatoren für Informations- und Transaktionskosten spielen ebenfalls eine Rolle.
Länderrisiken haben in der Vorkrisenzeit die Investitionen in Dividendenpapiere nicht
signifikant beeinträchtigt.
Eine Untersuchung auf Basis der deutschen Depotstatistik offenbart einen deutlichen
Einfluss der Finanzkrise auf die regionale und sektorale Aufteilung deutscher
Wertpapierbestände. Es zeigt sich, dass die Aktien von Finanzinstituten überproportional
von der Umschichtung der Portfolios betroffen waren. Ein wichtiges Ergebnis ist auch,
dass insbesondere Banken ihr Auslandsengagement stark reduziert haben. Diese
Entwicklungen könnten zum Teil auch Folge eines Deleveraging-Prozesses gewesen sein,
der durch die Finanzkrise in Gang gesetzt wurde.

Portfolio Holdings in the Euro Area -
Home Bias and the Role of
International, Domestic and Sector-Specific Factors*
I. Introduction
This paper analyses the development and the determinants of European financial
integration since the introduction of the euro with a special focus on investment behaviour
during the financial crisis. We will compare equity portfolio holdings of euro area investors
in other euro area countries to those in major countries outside the monetary union. This
should reveal, to what extent investors regard the euro area as a single financial market,
whether this assessment has changed since the turbulence of the past years and how far
financial integration in the euro area has caused a stronger exposure to international
financial transmission channels during the crisis.
Devereux and Yetman (2009) and Krugman (2008) suggest that there exists an
international transmission channel of crises not only via the traditional trade links but also
via financial linkages, namely via the process of financial deleveraging. The process of
deleveraging, triggered by an adverse shock in the home or the host country, can entail
strong macroeconomic effects and also contribute to the contagion of third economies.
Possible channels are the lower amount of loans provided by financial institutions to
borrowers abroad, who may be faced with problems of revolving existing credits, or the
vicious circle of deleveraging, falling asset prices and the detrimental effects on the balance
sheets of other financial institutions that also need to deleverage as a consequence.
Against this background, it is of interest to analyse financial integration on the sectoral
level. We will differentiate for both the sector of investment and the sector of investor.
Doing so, affords a better understanding of spill-over effects of financial shocks and may
give additional insight into the investment behaviour and risk attitude of various types of
investors. Given the origins and the characteristics of the past crisis, the banking sector is
deemed to have played a key role in the spread of market disturbances and the subsequent
restructuring of financial assets.
* For their valuable comments, we are indebted to Volker Clausen, Roberto A. De Santis, Ulrich Grosch,
Heinz Herrmann, Sabine Herrmann, Robert E. Lipsey, Stefan Reitz, to the participants of the ESCB seminar
on Macro-Financial Risks and Vulnerabilities 14/15 June 2010 in Frankfurt am Main and to the participants
of two internal workshops at Deutsche Bundesbank. The views expressed in this paper are those of the
authors and not necessarily the opinion of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
­ 2 ­
A popular (inverse) measure of financial integration is the home bias in national portfolio
holdings. According to the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (I-CAPM) of Solnik
(1974), the composition of stock portfolios should be identical in all individual countries
and correspond to the structure of world market capitalisation. Since the pioneering work
of French and Poterba (1991), if not earlier, it has been well known that domestic investors
of almost any country hold too little of their financial wealth in foreign assets when
compared with the benchmark of standard portfolio theory.
The existence of a home bias is commonly attributed to transaction and information costs,
which are incurred in imperfect capital markets and encourage the holding of domestic
stocks. In this vein, studies by Kang and Stulz (1997), Hau (2001), Ahearne, Griever and
Warnock (2004), Cai and Warnock (2004), Dvorak (2005), Portes and Rey (2005), Kho,
Stultz and Warnock (2006) and Daude and Fratzscher (2006) find that information costs,
like telecommunication infrastructure or distance, have a major explanatory power for the
observed home bias.
By contrast, the influence of transaction costs is much disputed in the literature. Tesar and
Werner (1995) argue that the large volume of cross-border capital flows and the high
turnover rate of foreign equity investments relative to turnover on domestic equity markets
suggest that transaction costs are an unlikely explanation for home bias. Warnock (2002)
challenges the finding of a high turnover rate but confirms that transaction costs are an
unlikely explanation. Other studies such as Faruqee, Li and Yan (2004), however, find a
major explanatory power for corresponding variables, such as bilateral distance or bilateral
phone costs.1
Another strand of the literature tries to explain deviations of portfolio holdings from the I-
CAPM benchmark by additional classes of risk that are omitted in the basic model. While
Cooper and Kaplanis (1994) do not find evidence for the hypothesis that the preference of
domestic shares can be traced back to the hedging of domestic inflation, Fidora, Fratzscher
and Thimann (2007) stress the segmenting effect of real exchange rate volatility. However,
Wincoop and Warnock (2006) conclude that the empirical correlation between excess
equity returns and the real exchange rate is too low to explain observed equity home bias.
In response to this objection, Coeurdacier and Gourinchas (2009) show that while real
exchange rate risks are indeed hedged through international bond holdings, domestic
equities can provide a good hedge against non-financial income risk.
1 Apparently, the distinction between variables representing information costs and transaction costs is not
clear.
­ 3 ­
This paper ties in with the risk aspect of home bias and tries to find out, whether the
perception of risk related to foreign assets differs with regard to investment outside and
inside the euro area and with regard to different sectors. Besides real exchange rate
volatility, which can at the best explain the regional orientation of investors, we are looking
for additional aspects that might play a role in market segmentation.
Our approach differs from the cited literature, in that it uses detailed databases of the IMF
and the Deutsche Bundesbank, which have only recently become available. The IMF's
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) allows an exploration of bilateral
portfolio holdings of euro-area countries since 2001 by including determinants of the
partner countries and bilateral factors. In earlier studies, this was possible only for flows of
investment, the structure of which, however, may deviate substantially from the regional
composition of stocks. An even more detailed investigation of the regional and sectoral
composition of German portfolio holdings can be undertaken using the German Securities
Statistics Database of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
We find that financial integration is decisively more advanced within European Monetary
Union (EMU) than between member countries and countries outside the euro area. This
outcome can partially be attributed to the abolition of exchange rate risk. Traditional
indicators of information and transaction costs also seem to be relevant. In addition, the
perception of sovereign risk became more important as a determinant of portfolio
allocation during the financial crisis. In the years before the crisis, this aspect had
obviously been neglected, and risk aspects have systematicly been "underpriced" in stock
markets.2 On the sectoral level, the shares of financial corporations have been affected
disproportionately by reshuffling in security portfolios during the crisis. Furthermore,
deleveraging of monetary financial institutions also played an active role with respect to
portfolio restructuring during the crisis.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II gives a brief overview of
economic theory on portfolio holdings and home bias. Data are described briefly in
section III, before section IV highlights developments of home bias in euro-area countries
and differences between intra and extra-EMU portfolio holdings. In section V, we analyse
the determinants of bilateral home bias, while section VI focuses on sectoral characteristics
and the impact of the financial crisis on German portfolio holdings. Section VII concludes.

II. The Concepts of Optimal Portfolio Selection and Home Bias
1. Optimal Portfolio Selection
According to Tobin's famous separation theorem "... the proportionate composition of the
non-cash assets is independent of their aggregate share of the investment balance..." if
markets are purely competitive and investors are risk-averse.3 Following the notation of
Lintner (1965), expected returns and the variance of the total portfolio are given by4

where  = total expected returns, P

By combining investments in riskless bonds and a given market portfolio, an investor can
realise any point on the market opportunity line, which is given by the linear relationship5

defines the slope of the market opportunity line. Given the assumption that investors are
risk-averse, the optimal composition of the market portfolio can be derived by maximising
 subject to the share of individual stocks included in the portfolio. Under the assumptions
mentioned above and if short-selling is permitted, the vector of optimal stock shares in the
market portfolio is given by
3 Tobin (1958, 85). While Tobin's original proof further relies on quadratic utility functions or multivariate
normal rates of return, Lintner (1965) has proved the separation theorem to be valid independently of these
additional assumptions.
4 An equivalent model was developed by Sharpe (1963).
5 If borrowing is unrestricted, the share of total wealth invested in the market portfolio () may even exceed
unity.

The International Capital Asset Pricing Model (I-CAPM) developed by Solnik (1974)
introduces exchange rates as an additional aspect and derives important conclusions
concerning the diversification in stock and bond portfolios. While the stock portfolio is
hedged against exchange rate risks, bond holdings are (only) speculative in the exchange
risk dimension. One important implication of the model is that the composition of stock
portfolios is identical in all individual countries and corresponds to the structure of world
market capitalisation. This market portfolio serves as a reference for the following analysis.
2. Home Bias and Possible Extensions
In reality, most national stock portfolios differ from this benchmark, with domestic shares
being relatively over-represented as against foreign shares. Referring to the pioneering
work of French and Poterba (1991), this phenomenon has become familiar as home bias
and can be measured by the formula:
i
i
i
i
f

1 (5)
where the subindex i indicates country i, i
i
f
is the share of foreign stocks in country i's
stock portfolio and
i
f
~
their weight in the world market portfolio.
If the index is unity, the domestic portfolio exclusively contains domestic shares, while a
value of zero describes a perfect match of the domestic portfolio with the market
portfolio.6 The index may also adopt negative values if foreign shares are over-represented
with respect to their share in the market portfolio.
6 In the text and the figures, home bias is usually reported as a percentage. An increase of the home bias by
1 percentage point indicates an increase in the under-representation of foreign stocks in domestic portfolios
by 1% of their share in the world market portfolio.
­ 6 ­
In addition to the general home bias defined above, it is possible to calculate a bilateral
home bias vis-ŕ-vis an individual country or a specific region like the euro area. In this case
equation (5) becomes

III. The Data
Since there is no single dataset that allows for a comprehensive investigation of home bias
before and during the financial crisis, this paper draws mainly on two data sources, the
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the German Securities Statistics Database of the Deutsche Bundesbank. To calculate
portfolio holdings in Figure 1, we have furthermore used data of the IMF International
Financial Statistics database and the dataset on the External Wealth of Nations (EWN),
provided by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007).
Bilateral investment data for equity securities of ten EMU countries7 and three major non-
EMU investment partner countries8 stem from the CPIS (Figure 2). The CPIS contains
stock data for bilateral portfolio investment and was first edited for the year 1997. Starting
in 2001, it is available on an annual basis.
For analysing investment behaviour during the financial crisis, we use quarterly data for
German investments in the same countries as above from the German Securities Statistics
Database. This contains sectorally disaggregated bilateral portfolio holdings for Germany
on a quarterly basis. Consistent data are available since the fourth quarter of 2007. The
observation period covered in the following analysis spans the period until the fourth
quarter of 2009.
7 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Ireland
and Luxemburg are excluded because of special factors related to their financial industry which heavily
distort their data of revealed home bias. For countries that joined the euro area after 2001, the relevant
datasets are still incomplete.
8 Japan, United Kingdom and United States.

Data on market capitalisation stem from the ECB database on Security Issues Statistics,
Eurostat, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the Federation of European
Securities Exchanges, and the World Federation of Exchanges.
IV. Development of the Home Bias in EMU Countries
Figure 1 depicts the historical development of general home bias from 1991 onwards. In
1991, when the data were first collected, most countries exhibited very high values. Spain
and Finland were close to 100%, France, Germany, Italy and Portugal ranged between 86%
and 92%. In 1991, only Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands displayed values below 70%.
Until 1998 these values barely changed. Then, however, the solely lateral movement ended
and a general decrease in home bias commenced. It was only in Greece and Spain that
investors still display a strong bias towards investing domestically with a home bias of
slightly above 80%. The Netherlands, with a home bias of only 12%, range at the other end
of the scale.

Figure 2 illustrates the regional decomposition of home bias in portfolio holdings of intra
and extra-EMU equity securities for the four biggest EMU economies from 1997
onwards.9 As depicted, the data reveal a clear difference in home bias for intra and extra-
euro-area investments. While the home bias for investments stemming from EMU investor
countries in Japan, the US and the UK remains at rather high levels, it has fallen distinctly
for investments within the euro area, especially during the first years after the introduction
of the euro.

For France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the extra-EMU home bias fluctuates around 90% in
all the years displayed, whereas the intra-EMU home bias ranges perceptibly lower. In
some cases, negative values can be observed for the bilateral home bias between individual
countries, i.e. some countries "overinvest" in other countries compared with the I-CAPM

reasons of clarity.
V. Determinants of Portfolio Holdings in EMU Member States
1. Intra- and Extra-EMU Portfolio Holdings
In this section, we investigate the underlying causes of regional differences in equity
holdings and, thus, in bilateral home bias as illustrated in section IV for the time up to the
financial crisis. With data from ten EMU countries for the period 2001-2008, we perform a
panel investigation of their bilateral holdings among each other as well as between them as
investor countries and the top three non-EMU destinations, namely Japan, the United
Kingdom and the United States.11
Separate estimations for intra and extra-euro-area investments are performed. The

the world portfolio. If investments followed the I-CAPM, we would expect
1
 to
equal unity. Standard portfolio theory assumes that capital markets are perfect, i.e. there are
no transaction costs, taxes or capital controls and no constraints on international capital
flows.13 This implies that the traditional I-CAPM scenario ignores additional variables.
In reality, capital markets are far from frictionless. In order to explain the resulting
deviation of capital allocation from the benchmark, the I-CAPM has been augmented by a
number of control variables representing information and transaction costs. They are
summarised by the vector costi,j
in equation (8) and comprise the logarithm of distance
10 Lane (2006) has also found a "euro area bias" of EMU member states for bond portfolios.
11 For intra-EMU holdings, all country pairs are considered where both countries are members of the EMU.
For extra-EMU holdings, the analysis includes country pairs where the investing country is one of the ten
EMU countries and the emitting country is Japan, the US or the UK.
12 Linear regression estimates are performed using Stata 11.0 including AR(1) terms. When computing the
standard errors and the variance-covariance estimates, disturbances were assumed to be heteroskedastic and
contemporaneously correlated across panels.

between the capitals of the issuing and investing countries (distij
), a dummy variable that
takes the value one if the two countries share a common border and zero otherwise
(neighbourij
), the corruption perception index score published by transparency
international (tpij
) and the logarithmic number of analyst reports per company contained in
the IBES stock index (analystsj
).14 In addition to these cost factors, various risk elements
represented by the vector riskij
may also have a distracting effect on the allocation of
capital that goes beyond the potential of diversification in the world market portfolio. In
our regressions, we have accounted for the bilateral exchange rate volatility (
ij
fx ),
measured by the coefficient of variation, to capture bilateral fluctuations, the role of the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index (VIX) as a measure of global
uncertainty on stock markets as well as the price of credit default swaps for five-year
government bonds of country j (
j
cds ), which is used as a measure of sovereign risk
directly perceived by the markets.15 Governments have played a crucial role in managing
and alleviating the financial crises of recent years, which underlines the relevance of their
own solvency for investors, even in the private equity segment.16 The incentives of
foreigners to retreat their capital in order to escape the consequences of an imminent
national insolvency might be even more pronounced than for residents, who have to be
aware of potential repercussions on the national economic environment and will anyway
stay within the grasp of their government. In addition, aspects beyond conventional yield-
risk optimisation may also play a role. Investors with a high preference for domestic shares
generally seem to be led by other motives, as well. Consequently, they might be less
sensitive to changes in domestic cds premia than investors with a more diversified stock
portfolio.
Performing the regressions without control variables, i.e. testing the traditional I-CAPM,
the elasticity of portfolio holding,
1
 , significantly exceeds unity for intra-EMU
investments and is less than unity for extra-EMU investments. The corresponding
estimation is presented in the first column of Table 1 for investments within euro-area
countries and in the third column for investments outside the euro area. As the 95%
14 Data for analysts are provided by Thomson Financial, Datastream. Alternatively to the number of
companies, we have normalised the number of analysts by national market capitalisation. The estimation
results, however, alter only marginally.
15 Data for VIX and CDS also stem from Thomson Financial, Datastream. An alternative measure, the
sovereign bond spreads to German government bonds calculated on the base of benchmark yields published
by the Bank of International Settlement (BIS), leads to very similar results for investments in other euro area
countries throughout all the following regressions. For investment in non-EMU countries, however, this
indicator is less adequate, since it includes anticipated exchange rate changes. For a detailed discussion of
EMU countries' sovereign bond spreads as a measure of market perceptions of default probabilities, see Dötz
and Fischer (2010).
16 See ECB (2010), pp. 10 ff.

confidence interval clearly demonstrates, in both cases the coefficient is different from
unity. Thus, theoretical prediction and the real outcome do not coincide. This result points
to a high reagibility of investors with regard to developments in other euro-area countries
and to a high degree of financial integration and interdependency. It also corresponds to the
elevated home bias of EMU countries vis-ŕ-vis countries outside the euro area that has
been depicted in Figure 2 and is also consistent with the finding of De Santis (2010) and
De Santis and Gérard (2009), who determine that euro-area investors have increased the
weight of portfolio investments in other euro-area countries due to the economic and
monetary union. Apparently, cross-border capital flows of euro-area countries are diverted
to other EMU member states as a response to lasting frictions in the international financial
markets.
Including the traditional control variables, such as transaction and information costs, as
well as the inclusion of risk aspects shifts
1
 towards unity in both scenarios, intra and
extra-euro-area. Results are depicted in the second and fourth columns of Table 1. Without
control variables,
1
 equals 1.29 or 0.64, and, including control variables, 1.10 or 1.23 (in
intra and extra-EMU investments respectively). The 95% confidence interval for those
coefficients clearly demonstrates that unity is included only in the comprehensive
regressions.17
17 The confidence intervals are displayed in squared brackets, but only for national weights in the market
portfolio as an explanatory variable. The reason for this is that, in this case, the coefficient equals unity under
H0
. For all the other coefficients, H0
predicts values of zero, and statistical significance is indicated by
asterisks.

portfolio holdings towards its theoretical benchmark in both samples, in this section we

signs. The coefficients for analystj
and neighbouri,j
are significant at a 10%-level and also
show the expected signs. The more distant and the less transparent a country is, the greater
is the preference for domestic investments. The closer the investor's home country is
located to the seat of a company, the greater is his or her involvement. This relationship
probably reflects the ease of collecting information and similarity of institutions in both
countries. Sovereign risk measured by the price of credit default swaps for five-year
government bonds obviously had no detrimental effect on portfolio holdings during the
sample period. This result gives support to the conjecture that solvency risks of EMU
partner countries were often neglected before the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007.19
The number of analyst reports per company has a slightly significant, positive impact on
portfolio holdings within EMU member states. The inclusion of a global risk variable
(VIX) did not increase the explanatory power of the estimates presented in this paper,
which is probably due to the very limited number of varying values within the dataset. The
same is true of exchange rate volatility. For this reason, the variable has been excluded
from the regressions. Since there is no exchange rate volatility within the currency union,
the respective variable has been omitted in this regression.
For extra-EMU investments tpij
does not have a significant impact and neighbouri,j
is zero
throughout as there is no common border between EMU countries and the US, the UK or
Japan. The price of credit default swaps, which has so far failed to be significant, now
enters the regression with a significantly negative impact on home bias. This somehat
counterintuitive outcome matches with the statement of Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2010),
who have observed a systematic "underpricing" of risk in the stock markets as a secondary
effect of excessive profit seeking. The impact of analyst coverage on extra-EMU portfolio
holdings is negative and leaves room for speculation that, during the observation period,
analysts might have sent disproportionately negative signals from these markets, a
hypothesis that will be elaborated further in the next section.20 In line with the theoretical
prediction and the empirical findings of Fidora, Fratzscher and Thimann (2007), the
coefficient for exchange rate volatility is positive and significant, implying that higher
exchange rate volatility impaired investment of euro area member states in third countries
and that the high degree of financial integration within the euro area can partly be traced
back to the abolition of exchange rate risks.
19 See Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2010) or Dötz and Fischer (2010).
20 Neither the inclusion of a liquidity measure for the issuing market nor the use of country or country-pair
fixed effects changes the signs or significance of the coefficients presented (except for
j
tpi in the intra-EMU
case, which turns statistically insignificant when country or country-pair dummies are included).

VI. Sectoral Characteristics of German Home Bias
1. General Developments During the Financial Crisis
Besides the regional provenience of the securities under consideration, portfolio holdings
and their reagibility to shocks may also depend on the sectoral category of both investors
and shares. The German securities statistics database maintained by the Deutsche
Bundesbank provides a detailed insight into the sectoral and regional structure of securities
held in custody accounts at German banks. The data set used for the following analysis
comprises quarterly data from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009. It
therefore covers the critical period when the financial crisis has spilled over from US
mortgage companies to the worldwide capital markets and the real economy. This section
focuses on differences in the behaviour of German investors, depending on the sector and
the regional provenience of shares as well as investor category.
In addition to a regional disaggregation, the basic concept of home bias can be broken
down into several components, either by the sector of investment or the institutional sector
of investors. These measures of sectoral home bias can be aggregated to the general home
bias by using the weights of the respective sectors in the national portfolio holdings:

where

ptf is the market value of country i's stock portfolio and z is an index of sectors
and can denote both the classification of shares or of investors.
Figure 3 gives a brief overview of the sectoral composition and the development of home
bias in German portfolio holdings since the beginning of the current financial crisis.21 We
distinguish between portfolio investments in monetary financial institutions (MFI),
insurance companies and pension funds (INS & PENS), mutual funds and other financial
institutions (MUT & OFI), as well as non-financial institutions (Non-Fin). Apparently,
general home bias was tending to increase until the fourth quarter of 2008, which was also
the preliminary peak of the global financial crisis. Since then, it has been diminishing
21 The observed changes in home bias are not necessarily due to portfolio shifts alone, but might also reflect
valuation effects. A more than proportionate fall in stock prices of foreign securities relative to the market
value of German shares, for instance, results in an increasing (positive) home bias, even if no quantitative
adjustments take place. However, if foreign shares are over-represented in German portfolios relative to their
weight in the world market portfolio (negative home bias), the relation is reversed.

again. This course can be observed for both, investments inside and outside the euro-
area.22

Apart from that, however, there are striking differences between portfolio holdings intra
and extra-EMU. While German home bias is still substantial against Japan, United
Kingdom or the United States, securities of companies domiciled in euro-area countries
abroad are even over-represented in German portfolios, when compared with the regional
composition of the world market portfolio. This EMU bias, which is represented by a
negative bilateral home bias, is due primarily to a clear regional preference in the case of
shares issued by monetary financial institutions (MFI). Changes in this sector are also the
most important driving force behind the overall development of the euro area bias during
the financial crisis, even if the weight of this sector in German portfolio holdings does not
exceed 10%.23 With respect to the three big economies outside EMU, on the other hand,
22 Home bias indices derived from the German securities statistics database cannot be compared directly with
values based on the CPIS, since the former database comprises listed shares without differentiating between
portfolio and foreign direct investment, while the latter database accounts for all shares and investment
certificates, but does not contain equity holdings that are classified as foreign direct investment.
23 Similar to the dynamics of the overall home bias (see footnote 20), observed changes in sectoral home bias
are not necessarily due to portfolio shifts alone. Other things equal, a relative decline in asset prices of a given
sector will lower the weight of economies, which are specialised in this sector, in the world market portfolio.
As a consequence, the sectoral home bias measured by equation (7) will fall. Since this valuation effect would
counteract the impact of a potential capital retreat, the development of sectoral home bias might
­ 17 ­
the magnitude and the performance of home bias were clearly dominated by investments in
non-financial corporations. This impact corresponds to their weight of roughly 80% in
German portfolios, while unweighted home bias is not particularly high in this sector,
compared with the bilateral home bias of the other sectors depicted in Figure 3.
Turning to the institutional categories of portfolio holders, we again distinguish between
the four sectors defined above but add households as a fifth important group of investors.
Figure 4 illustrates the various degrees of home bias with respect to investments inside and
outside the euro area.

In all sectors, the degree of home bias is definitely higher against Japan, United Kingdom
or the United States than against euro-area member states. Interestingly, the EMU bias
already identified above is caused by mutual funds and other financial institutions alone.
Despite their high exposure to foreign markets, they reduced their positions abroad only
marginally and temporarily during the crisis. This might be due to the fact that fund
managers have to take note of possible repercussions which arise from their market power
or their commitment to given stock market indices. Insurance companies and pension
funds, which also had a preference for foreign EMU member states at the beginning of the
observation period, have continuously reduced their portfolio investment in these countries,
underestimate the restructuring in national portfolios. Provided that the impact of sector specific shocks on a
country's market capitalisation as a share of the world portfolio is small, the valuation effect is limited.
­ 18 ­
especially since the beginning of 2009. Non-financial corporations almost exclusively hold
German shares, which clearly points to investment motivations other than the Markovitz-
type yield-risk optimisation. The regional structure of investment was most volatile in the
portfolio holdings of monetary financial institutions, which stood in the centre of the global
crisis. Households, by contrast, exhibit a relatively steady and modest degree of home bias.
2. German Home Bias Depending on the Sector of Investment
In order to gain a better understanding of the possible determinants of the stylised facts
identified so far, and especially the behaviour of investors during the financial crisis, it is
useful to analyse whether investors discriminated between developments that occurred in
the crisis sectors and developments in industries that were affected only indirectly by the
subsequent distortions. As before, cost and risk denote vectors of variables related to
transaction or information costs and the actual or perceived investment risk, respectively.

In Table 3, estimates for aggregate investments of German investors (columns 1 and 6) are
compared with the parameters stemming from sector-specific estimates. We again
distinguish between euro-area and non-euro-area stocks. Apart from neighbourDj
, which
turns out to be insignificant due to a high correlation with distDj
and Germany as the only
country of reference, we use the same explanatory variables as in the previous section.
Obviously, the sovereign risk of the partner country significantly raises the bilateral home
bias in stocks, i.e. investors seem to retreat into more familiar domestic areas whenever the
general investment climate in the foreign country becomes more uncertain. Within
European Monetary Union, this flight into the "home haven" is significant only for equity
securities of monetary financial institutions and mutual funds (including other financial
institutions), but not for stocks of insurance companies or pension funds and non-financial

corporations. This differentiation can probably be attributed to the character of the
economic crisis, which is essentially linked to financial institutions with elevated risk
positions and the prominent role of government support in managing the crisis. The
portfolios of pension funds and insurance companies, which have to observe strict risk
preventing rules, were less affected. Spill-over effects to the real economy only emerged
with some time lag and were cushioned by unprecedented economic stimulus packages.

For investments outside the EMU, credit default swaps also play a significant role,
especially with regard to MFI stocks. Furthermore, a slightly significant impact can be
detected for shares issued by non-financial corporations. Like in the general estimates for
ten euro-area countries, the number of analyst reports per company contained in the IBES
stock index apparently plays a more important role for investments outside the euro area
than for intra-euro-area portfolio holdings. A possible explanation might be that, for intra-
euro-area investments, other sources of information are also amply available. The negative
impact on extra-EMU portfolio holdings stated in section IV is reaffirmed for shares issued
by monetary financial institutions, while the effect is positive elsewhere. This specification
backs the hypothesis formulated above that negative outlooks of analysts might have
aggravated the withdrawal of investors from crisis-ridden sectors and countries. The
general level of transparency as attested by transparency international proved to be non-
significant in most cases, even if there is some evidence of a slight negative impact on the
home bias. Contrary to the results of the aggregate estimates, exchange rate risk apparently
was not decisive for the segmentation between intra and extra euro area investment during
the crisis. Instead, the geographical distance of the country of origin from Germany, which
serves as a rough proxy of various transaction and information costs, had a more valuable
impact on investment decisions of German security holders.
3. German Home Bias Depending on the Type of Investor
While investment behaviour obviously varies according to the sector of equity securities, it
may also depend on specific characteristics of the investor. For example, it may be argued
that institutional investors are generally better informed than individuals and that non-
financial corporations may have different investment principles than financial corporations.
In Table 4, estimates of portfolio holdings are presented which distinguish, first, between
institutional investors of the sectors described above and private investors, as well as,
second, investments within European Monetary Union and investments in the United
Kingdom, the United States or Japan. Again, we regress the home bias on a set of variables
that proxy information and transaction costs as well as on the price of credit default swaps
and exchange rate volatility as risk elements. The corresponding regressions are given by

Table 4 reveals that sovereign risk of the host country was the most important driving
force of home bias during the observation period. The impact was generally higher for
intra-euro-area investments. This elevated sensitivity might be a reaction to the previous
negligence of structural differences within monetary union that only became apparent with
the outbreak of the financial crisis.25 However, the estimated reagibility of monetary
financial institutions, albeit positive, is not significant in statistical terms. This outcome
indicates that the deleveraging process depicted in Figures 3 and 4 was triggered by
inherent risks in the balance sheets of commercial banks rather than by exogenous risk
factors. Again, analyst coverage seems to reduce information asymmetry between domestic
and foreign investors only for shares stemming from countries outside the euro area, and
even there the impact was statistically significant only for investments of MFIs. The
transparency index is not able to explain changes in time or differences between sectors or
regions. Exchange rate risk, which otherwise was not found to be decisive for German
investment decisions, seems to have had a deterrent impact on portfolio investment of non-
financial enterprises. However, this sector generally exhibits a very limited willingness to
hold foreign securities (Figure 4). Distance again seems to collect a number of cost factors,
which are relevant for all groups of investors except monetary financial institutions and
carry weight especially for investments outside the euro area.
25 See Dötz and Fischer (2010), who identify a change of market perception of EMU sovereign bond risk
since March 2008. The authors argue that prior to the crisis government bonds of member countries had
generally been assessed as homogenous in terms of risk, but that some countries have then lost their former
role as a safe haven. See also Lane and Ferretti (2010) for the "underpricing" of risk aspects prior to the
financial crisis.

VII. Conclusion
Summarising, we find that financial integration is decisively more advanced within
European Monetary Union (EMU) than between member countries and countries outside
the euro area. This outcome can partially be attributed to the abolition of exchange rate
risk. Traditional indicators of information and transaction costs also play a role. Sovereign
risks do not seem to have affected investment in equity securities prior to the crisis. The
analysis of German deposit statistics reveals a clear impact of the financial crisis on the
regional and sectoral structure of German portfolio holdings. Prices of credit default swaps
for government bonds of the country of origin proved to be a significant determinant of
investors' willingness to hold foreign stocks of this country. The retreat of German
investors was more pronounced than that of domestic investors whenever the sovereign
risk of a foreign country was rising. This indicates that, besides the well-known flight to a
"safe haven", which should be the same for all investors, there also exists a retreat into the
familiar "home haven".
Another lesson that might be drawn from the analysis is that the financial sector is still at
the centre of the current crisis, and that the shares of financial corporations were affected
disproportionately by reshuffling in security portfolios. In addition, monetary financial
institutions also played an active role with respect to portfolio restructuring during the
crisis. Their reorientation to domestic shares to the detriment of foreign stocks apparently
reflects the deleveraging process that was triggered by inherent risks in their balance sheets
rather than by exogenous risk factors. Insurance companies and pension funds as well as
mutual funds and other financial institutions also reduced their risk exposure, but behaved
in a less volatile manner on the whole. One possible explanation for this behaviour may be
that fund managers have to take note of possible repercussions which arise from their
market power and the restrictive risk-preventing rules that apply to the governance of
pension funds and insurance companies.
