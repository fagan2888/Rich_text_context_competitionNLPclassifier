Trends in Children's Exposure to Violence, 2003 to 2011
David Finkelhor, PhD; Anne Shattuck, MA; Heather A. Turner, PhD; Sherry L. Hamby, PhD
Rates of violent crime have declined in the United States
since the mid-1990s.1 This decline includes violent
crimes, property crimes, and sex crimes.2-4 Children
may also have benefitted from these trends. For example, rates
of physical and sexual abuse substantiated by child protec-
tion authorities declined 56% and 63%, respectively, from 1992
to 2011.5,6 Violence against youth aged 12 to 17 years, mea-
sured by self-report surveys such as the National Crime Vic-
timization Survey, also declined substantially from the mid-
1990s onward.7 Surveys of bullying and school violence have
shown similar large drops.8
We recently released a report that presented incidence es-
timates for a wide range of childhood exposures to violence
and victimization for 2011 based on a national survey of chil-
dren and caregivers.9 Although that report looked at short-
term changes since 2008, we also have the ability to look at
changes during a longer period, since 2003.
We have completed 3 comprehensive national surveys of
children's exposure to violence and abuse, in 2003, 2008, and
2011, which all used similar methods and questionnaires. Al-
though we have reported some of the shorter-term changes in
victimization rates,9 we have not previously analyzed the
changesoverthelongerperiod,norhaveweanalyzedthetrends
by demographic subgroups to see whether the changes may
haveaffectedchildrendifferentially.Wehavealsoaddedanaly-
ses of perpetration rates to compare with victimization trends.
Methods
Participants
This analysis draws on 3 similarly designed national tele-
phone surveys: The Developmental Victimization Survey
(2003)10 and the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Vio-
IMPORTANCE The study suggests that years of public policy designed to reduce the burden of
violence and victimization among youths is having some success.
OBJECTIVE To identify trends in children's exposure to violence, crime, and abuse from 2003
through 2011.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three national telephone surveys of representative
samples of children and caregivers from 2003, 2008, and 2011 were compared, all obtained
using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire; samples included parents of children 2 to 9
years old and youth 10 to 17 years old.
EXPOSURES Direct and indirect experiences of violence, abuse, and victimization during the
previous year.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in rates between 2003 and 2011 and between
2008 and 2011.
RESULTS Of 50 trends in exposure examined, there were 27 significant declines and no
significant increases between 2003 and 2011. Declines were particularly large for assault
victimization, bullying, and sexual victimization. There were also significant declines in the
perpetration of violence and property crime. For the recession period between 2008 and
2011, there were 11 significant declines and no increases for 50 specific trends examined.
Dating violence declined, as did one form of sexual victimization and some forms of indirect
exposure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Victimization surveys with general population samples
confirm patterns seen in police data and adult surveys. Crime and violence have been
declining in the child and youth population as well.

lence (NatSCEV) I (2008)11 and II (2011).9 The primary founda-
tion of the design for all 3 studies was a nationwide sampling
frame of residential telephone numbers from which a sample
ofhouseholdswasdrawnbyrandomdigitdialing.TheNatSCEV
I was supplemented with oversamples of households in areas
with high concentrations of minorities and low-income fami-
lies, and the NatSCEV II was supplemented with 2 additional
samples, a random digit dialing of cell phones, and an address-
based sample9 to represent the growing number of house-
holds that rely entirely or mostly on cell phones. Although the
NatSCEV I and II had information on children and youth aged
1 month through 17 years, because the Developmental Victim-
ization Survey had information only on children and youth
aged 2 to 17 years, this more restricted age group was the ba-
sisofcomparisonamongthesurveys,yieldingsamplesof2030,
4046, and 4107 for 2003, 2008, and 2011, respectively.
Procedure
In all 3 surveys, a short interview was conducted with an adult
caregiver (usually a parent) to obtain family demographic in-
formation. One child was then randomly selected from all eli-
gible children living in a household by selecting the child with
the most recent birthday. If the selected child was 10 to 17 years
old, the main telephone interview was conducted with the
child. If the selected child was younger than 10, the interview
was conducted with the caregiver who "is most familiar with
the child's daily routine and experiences."
Respondentswerepromisedcompleteconfidentiality,pro-
vided oral informed consent, and were paid $20 for their par-
ticipation. Respondents who disclosed a situation of serious
threat or ongoing victimization were recontacted by a clinical
member of the research team, trained in telephone crisis coun-
seling, whose responsibility was to stay in contact with the re-
spondent until the situation was appropriately addressed lo-
cally. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board at the University of New Hampshire.
Measurement
Victimization
All 3 surveys used versions of the Juvenile Victimization Ques-
tionnaire, an inventory of childhood victimization described
in detail elsewhere.12 The 3 versions of this questionnaire dif-
fered slightly because survey questions were added and de-
letedovertime.However,nearlyallitemscommontothe3ver-
sions retained identical wording over time, and items were
asked in the same order in all 3 surveys. Specific items reflect-
ing the events are included in eAppendix 1, and definitions of
therescoredandaggregatevictimizationsineAppendix2,both
intheSupplement.Althoughinformationwasobtainedonlife-
time exposure to each victimization type, the trend analysis
was conducted only on exposures that occurred in the past
year.Thisisbecauselifetimeexposureislesssensitivefordocu-
menting trends. Moreover, official data documenting trends
are typically reported as a single-year incidence.
Delinquency
The 3 surveys also asked children and youth whether they had
engagedinspecifictypesofdelinquentbehaviorinthepastyear.
For these analyses, 2 binary variables measuring violent delin-
quency and property delinquency were created for respon-
dents 6 years or older from 7 items common to the 3 surveys.
Demographics
Demographic information was obtained in the initial parent
interview, including the child's sex, age (in years), race/
ethnicity (coded into 4 groups: white non-Hispanic, black non-
Hispanic, other race non-Hispanic, and Hispanic any race), so-
cioeconomicstatus(SES),andfamilystructure.Socioeconomic
status is a composite based on the sum of the standardized an-
nual household income and standardized parental education
(for the parent with the highest education) scores, which was
then re-standardized. Family structure was categorized into
3groups:childrenlivingwith(1)twobiologicaloradoptivepar-
ents, (2) a biological parent plus partner (spouse or non-
spouse), or (3) a single biological parent or other adult care-
giver. Region refers to the census region (Northeast, Midwest,
South, or West) where the child lives.
We used these demographic variables in two ways: (1) to
control for the possibility that changing demographic compo-
sition of the 2- to 17-year-old US population might be respon-
sible for changes in rates of children's exposure to violence and
(2) to determine whether trends in exposure to violence are
specific to certain demographic subgroups or regions of the
country.
Weighting
Each sample used weights to make it nationally representa-
tive of the population in the year of the survey by correcting
for sample-population differences in race/ethnicity, age, and
household income and for the differential probability of se-
lection within households.
Statistical Analysis
To facilitate comparing rates across time, comparable vari-
ables were first created in 3 separate data sets and then merged
into a single pooled data file. Estimated rates were calculated
by year using Stata 13 (StataCorp). Differences in rates be-
tween years were tested for significance using Stata's "lin-
com" post-estimation command. Rates were compared be-
tween 2003 and 2011 and between 2008 and 2011. Changes in
overall rates are shown as point changes in Table 1 and Table 2.
Second, logistic regression models were used to test
whether changes in overall rates were significant while con-
trolling for demographic factors. Logistic regression models
were tested with each victimization and delinquency type as
the dependent variable, demographic variables as control vari-
ables, and dummy variables for year. Odds ratios from these
regressions were used to derive percentage changes in rates
which are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Finally, comparisons were
madetodetermineifsubgroupsdifferedintheirchangesacross
time. Interaction terms for subgroup by year were added to the
regressionmodelsinthesecondanalysis,with1subgroupomit-
ted in each regression as the reference group. Significant sub-
group-by-year interaction terms indicated that the difference
between the change for 1 group and the change for the refer-
ence group was significant.

Results
Past-year assault rates against children showed a broad
decline from 2003 to 2011 (Table 1). The decline was 9.3
points, or 33%. Significant declines occurred during the
entire period for assaults involving weapons or injuries and
assaults by peers and siblings. Rates of physical intimidation
and emotional victimization (bullying) also declined during
this period; physical intimidation dropped 8 points, or by
more than one-third. Sexual victimization rates declined sig-
nificantly from 2003 to 2011, down by 25%. In regard to spe-
cific forms, rates of rape, flashing, and statutory sex offenses
were reduced significantly. The rate of child maltreatment
declined by 26% from 2003 to 2011; this decline was signifi-
cant only for emotional abuse and did not pertain to physical
abuse, which was unchanged. Property victimization rates
for children declined overall from 2003 to 2011, particularly
for vandalism and theft. Children's exposure to household
theft also declined during this period. Reports of children
witnessing violence declined overall from 2003 to 2011.
Delinquent behavior also declined during this period
(Table 2). Violent delinquency rates were reduced by almost
half between 2003 and 2011, as were rates of property delin-
quency. To summarize, of 50 specific trends examined
between 2003 and 2011, there were 27 significant declines
and no significant increases.
The overall trends from 2008 to 2011 have been reported
elsewhere,9 but without the controls for possible demo-
graphic shifts and without the perpetration items. Only 11 of
the 50 tested trends showed significant declines during this
more recent period, with no significant increases. Assault
rates declined by 10% from 2008 to 2011, particularly for
assaults with no weapon or injury, assaults involving peers
and siblings, and dating violence (Table 1). Since 2008, over-
all sexual victimization rates were not down significantly, but
the rate of flashing was. There were significant declines for

witnessing abuse of other children in the household; for
exposure to shooting, bombings, or riots; and for having
someone close murdered. Since 2008, both violent delin-
quency and property delinquency rates also declined
(Table 2).
We also conducted analyses to study whether the trends
were specific to certain demographic subgroups of children.
Few trends were specific to demographic subgroups, and
only the categories and types of victimization with some sig-
nificant trends are included in Table 3. From 2003 to 2011,
youth (aged 10-17 years) had significantly larger declines than
did younger children (aged 2-9 years) for assault with no
weapon or injury (P = .004) and attempted assault (P = .01).
Compared with children and youth from families with
medium and high SES, those from families with low SES had
significantly larger declines in overall maltreatment (low vs
medium SES, P = .004; low vs high SES, P = .002) and for
emotional abuse (low vs medium SES, P = .01; low vs high
SES, P = .001) Children from families with stepparents had a
significantly larger decline in overall maltreatment than chil-
dren from 2-parent families (P = .02). Boys had a significantly
larger decline than girls for dating violence victimization (P =
.02), and girls had a larger decline for nonsexual assault to the
genitals (P = .003).
In the more recent period, 2008 to 2011, younger children
had larger declines in property victimization rates (P = .046).
Children and youth from single-parent families had larger de-
clines for assault with no weapon than those from 2-parent
homes (P = .02), and boys had more decline in dating violence
than girls (P = .02).
Discussion
From 2003 to 2011, there were considerable declines in chil-
dren's past-year exposure to violence, crime, and abuse. Of 50
specific trends examined, 27 showed significant declines, with
no significant increases. Declines were particularly large for
rates of physical assault, physical intimidation, and sexual vic-
timization. The declines in victimization were validated, as
mightbeexpected,bydropsinyouthperpetrationratesaswell.
This certainly suggests that the decline seen for crime in gen-
eral applies to children and youth.
The recession era that started in 2008 did not seem to
reverse downward trends, although there were fewer signifi-
cant declines detectable during this shorter period from
2008 to 2011, with 11 declines among 50 specific trends
examined. Assault rates continued to decline, as did rates for
one form of sexual victimization and some forms of indirect
exposure. Perpetration of violence and property offenses
continued to decline. This suggests that although the reces-
sion may have caused much hardship, it did not translate
into more violence and crime exposure for children and
youth.
This finding is consistent with other evidence. The
National Crime Victimization Survey showed continuing
post-2008 declines in violent crime and property crime expo-
sure among youth.7,8,13 In addition, rates for substantiated
child maltreatment fell from 2008 to 2011, including declines
for sexual abuse.5 Police reports of crime and homicide also
dropped.

Ontheotherhand,somecontradictoryevidenceexists.Re-
search has found an increase in hospital-treated abusive head
trauma cases in 3 regions from 2007 to 2009.14 Physical abuse
and traumatic brain injury hospital admissions were associ-
ated with the mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rate but
not the unemployment rate, in data from 2000 to 2009.15 Both
of these studies concern small, although serious, segments of
the childhood violence exposure spectrum, and they did not
cover the full recession period; they also considered types of
victimization and part of the age spectrum (very young chil-
dren) not assessed in our study.
Theoverarchingepidemiologicpictureseemstoshowsub-
stantialdropsinviolenceandabuseexposureduringthe1990s,
with continuing declines during the 2000s that have not been
reversed by the economic adversities of the 2008 recession.
These declines have occurred for many kinds of exposure, in-
cluding assault, bullying, sexual assault, property crime, and
witnessing violence. Our data suggest that they have oc-
curred for boys and girls and for children of all races, in all re-
gions, and in cities and nonurban areas. However, some dif-
ferentials were noteworthy. The declines in assaults were
significantly larger for teens than for younger children, al-
though they occurred for both. The declines in maltreatment
had some differential strength among low-SES and steppar-
ent families.
Some caveats about our findings are warranted. First, even
with our large samples, the confidence intervals around rate
estimates are large enough that the exact percentage declines
are not precise. In addition, some of the categories have very
few events, making it difficult to detect change, especially in
the analysis of subcategories such as sex, SES, or family struc-
ture.Second,thefindingsdonotapplytochildrenyoungerthan
2 years, and there are some indications from other studies that
trends in this group might differ from trends for other chil-
dren. Third, we cannot exclude the possibility that some meth-
odologic artifact, for example, the shifts from landline to cell
phone use, may explain some of the trends. However, paral-
lel trends in agency and police data as well as in surveys con-
ducted in school environments make it less likely that meth-
odologic differences explain the declines.
What might account for these trends? Demographic fac-
tors do not seem to account for the overall decline. The de-
clines held when age, SES, racial composition, family struc-
ture, and region were controlled for.
Other factors would be worth investigating as possible
sources of these declines but are beyond the analytic re-
sources of this study. One may be the growth and dissemina-
tion of prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reduc-
ing youth violence and victimization. Anecdotal information
suggests that a variety of programs have been widely dissemi-
nated before and during our study period. These include
school-based prevention programs targeting bullying, inter-
personal conflict, and sexual and dating violence--some of
which have been effective in rigorous evaluation studies.16-19
Thedisseminatedprogramsalsoincludefamilypreventionand
intervention strategies that have shown effectiveness in re-
ducing child maltreatment and delinquent behavior, includ-
ingparentingeducationprograms.20-25 Someofthemostwidely
disseminated programs, such as home visitation, have been
differentially effective with low-income families,23 consis-
tent with the findings from our data. The programs include law
enforcement mobilization to reduce youth violence and vic-
timization, including school resource officers.
One potentially relevant intervention has been the grow-
ing use of psychiatric medication among youth and adults.26,27
This survey showed continuing growth from 2008, when 5.6%
of children and youth were taking such medication, to 2011,
when the rate was 7.8%. Such medication has been specifi-
cally targeted at children with aggressive behavior, which
showed clear declines in this study. More teens than younger
children receive such medication, consistent with our find-
ing about differential declines for older youth. Medication use
has also expanded for adults with depression and anxiety, per-
haps resulting in less intrafamily conflict and better parent-
ing and child supervision.
Another possible factor in reducing youth violence
exposure and delinquency is the growth of electronic tech-
nology and communication. As youth socialize and commu-
nicate electronically, they may be spending less time in face-
to-face contact situations where assaults and violence can
occur.28,29 Youth may also be doing more of their risk taking
and independence testing online, which may provide some
safeguards against immediate physical exposure to violence.
The engrossing quality of the Internet may also have under-
cut some of the boredom and alienation among youth that
have in the past been associated with delinquency and
criminal pursuits.28,30 Electronic media use has grown par-
ticularly dramatically among blacks and Hispanics in recent
years.30 At the same time, when children and youth do get
into threatening situations, cell phone technology now
affords them a way of summoning help or recording misbe-
havior, which may act as a deterrent.31,32
The issue of whether and how economic conditions may
apply to youth violence exposure needs more investigation.
Ourfindingsandthoseofotherresearch,however,suggestthat
the link may be less strong than is sometimes assumed. It is
true that some of the largest declines in youth violence and
victimizationoccurredinthemid-1990satatimeofstrongeco-
nomic growth and economic optimism,33 but declines have
continued when economic conditions turned negative. Re-
view articles on the effect of economic cycles on crime have
generally concluded that the effect is questionable and better
supported for property crime than for violent crime.34
More media and policy attention to declines in youth vio-
lence and exposure is important for several reasons. It is im-
portant to buffer widely held assumptions (often derived from
high-profile media stories, such as those on school shoot-
ings, Internet predators, or bullying-related suicides) that vio-
lence and abuse are on the rise, along with the facile blaming
of easy targets, such as video games, the Internet, funding cut-
backs, parental laxness, and insufficient criminal penalties.
Features of social change may have negative effects, but evi-
dence for such effects cannot be derived from invoking claims
about worsening exposure to violence.
Focusing attention on the declines may also help us to bet-

extending such improvements. Although evaluations of spe-
cific prevention programs are the most conclusive for guiding
prevention strategy, studies comparing local policy environ-
mentsandtheirassociationwithviolencetrendscouldbehelp-
fulinprovidingfeedbackaboutthevalueofvariouspolicymixes.
Epidemiologic studies addressing specific hypotheses, such as
the effects of psychiatric medication or cell phones, may pro-
vide guidance for the development of more specific programs
to increase the positive influence of such social changes.
Conclusions
The public health field has clearly demonstrated the value of
good epidemiologic data for managing and reducing a variety
of health problems. Unfortunately, the need for such data has
received less recognition in the fields of crime and child
abuse. Given the considerable public concern and policy
activity in these areas, however, high-quality epidemiologic
data should be a top priority. This should include more com-
prehensive and regular assessments of many childhood
exposures that are still poorly measured, including sexual
abuse (particularly sexual abuse by teachers and coaches),
neglect, bullying, and child abductions. Our current findings
illustrate the value of tracking trends, but our study was not
large enough for detecting changes in low-base-rate expo-
sures. More work is also needed to refine measurement and
assess the percentages of child survivors of violence who are
or are not coming to the attention of physicians, educators,
therapists, or law enforcement officials.
