How Exactly Do I "Let Go"? The Potential
of Using ACT to Overcome the Relaxation
Paradox

and Dermot Barnes-Holmes2
Abstract
Relaxation induced anxiety (RIA) or relaxation induced panic (RIP) occurs when a person's attempts to reduce anxiety
result in increased arousal. Such paradoxical increases often occur when relaxation is viewed as the avoidance of anxiety-
related experiences. In fact, passivity toward these experiences is necessary for successful relaxation. However, passivity is
not always easy to understand. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has attracted increasing interest in recent
years and adopts a similar position with regard to experiential avoidance. Reviewing literature on the relaxation paradox,
this article argues that incorporating elements of ACT into relaxation training might help overcome some problems with
passivity in relaxation.

Structured relaxation techniques have been a standard
component in therapy since they were first popularized by
Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) almost a
century ago (Jacobson, 1925, 1931, 1938). Since then, a
plethora of methods have evolved, and are subsumed under
the label of relaxation (Poppen, 1998). Although the
primary behavior that the practitioner engages in can often
vary significantly from one technique to another, and bear
little resemblance to Jacobson's original technique,
relaxation training (RT) is used to treat a wide range of
symptoms and disorders (Smith, 1996). It is even
recommended as a general adjunct to therapy to improve
clients' affect and general receptivity to treatment
(Lichstein, 1988).
Superficial differences across techniques may be
explained by the assertion that the state of relaxation (and
its antithesis, anxiety) depends on the interaction between
psychological and physiological processes, such that
different techniques focus primarily on one over the other.
For example, a practitioner may engage in a physical action
(e.g., by slowing breathing) which will, in turn, affect the
autonomic nervous system (ANS), and subsequently the
individual's cognitive processes, leading to a relaxed state.
Conversely, the individual may focus attention on
disrupting thought patterns that cause worry or anxiety,
which then leads to a reduction in physiological arousal.
When and Why Relaxation Doesn't Work
A number of authors have noted that not all clients benefit
from relaxation and these negative outcomes suggest that
the processes of relaxation, and particularly their
relationship with anxiety, are not fully understood. For
example, cases of relaxation induced anxiety (RIA; Heide
& Borkovec, 1984) and relaxation induced panic (RIP;
Adler, Craske, & Barlow, 1987) have been reported in the
literature. In response, Lazarus and Mayne (1990) argued
that RIA can be avoided by closely matching the relaxation
technique to the type of anxiety experienced or even to the
personality of the client. Alternatively, Heide and Borkovec
(1984) argued that the nature and extent of an individual's
evaluations of the relaxation technique influences the
outcome, because the individual is attending to intrusive
private events. Indeed, there is some evidence that
individuals perceive relaxation exercises as an effort to
modify or remove negative or anxiety-related private
events, in a type of experiential avoidance (Wegner,
Broome, & Blumberg, 1997).
Smith (1996) believed that unsuccessful attempts to
relax may relate to a lack of understanding of the central but
difficult concept of passivity. Passivity toward private
events is considered to be a fundamental component of
effective relaxation (Beary, Benson, & Klemchuk, 1974).
Passivity is described as a level of functional detachment
from the outcome of the technique, where attention toward

private events takes a non-active form (Davidson &
Schwartz, 1976).
There has been increased interest in acceptance and
mindfulness-based approaches in recent years and there is
increasing empirical support for their efficacy (Hayes,
2004). In addition, the core philosophy of these approaches
have much in common with the concept of passivity in
relaxation. Mindfulness involves focusing attention on the
present moment making contact with these experiences
without judgment or evaluation (Kabat-Zinn, 2003).
Acceptance may be conceptualized in simple terms as the
antithesis of experiential avoidance in that acceptance
means being able to remain in contact with private events,
rather than trying to reduce their occurrence (Barnes-
Holmes, Cochrane, Barnes-Holmes, Stewart, & McHugh,
2004). Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; Hayes,
Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999), which has its theoretical basis in
the relational frame theory (RFT; Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, &
Roche, 2001) account of language and cognition,
incorporates ideas such as acceptance, mindfulness, and
cognitive defusion, and utilizes behavioral change strategies
to allow clients to identify and move toward their own
personal values.
This article focuses on role of passivity in relaxation.
Specifically, we argue that current definitions of passivity
are ambiguous and purely descriptive--describing a state of
"awareness without attention" without discussing how to
achieve such a state. ACT incorporates a number of
techniques designed to address the language processes that
mediate experiential avoidance, which could help address
this problem. Furthermore, the term passivity is often used
to refer to distinctly different parts of the relaxation process:
the goal of the relaxation exercise, attention during
relaxation, and the evaluation of private events during
relaxation. We outline functional similarities between these
elements of relaxation and certain core concepts in ACT.
Finally, we suggest that if negative outcomes associated
with relaxation are due to unintentional experiential
avoidance, then re-framing relaxation in ACT terms and
utilizing linguistic techniques common to ACT might
increase the success of relaxation techniques in a clinical
setting.
Current Usage
RT has been used for the treatment of hundreds of
disorders, including general stress symptoms (Rausch,
Gramling, & Auerbach, 2006) or anxiety that is co-morbid
with other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder
(OCD; Twohig et al., 2010) or schizophrenia (Chen et al.,
2009). RT is most commonly used as part of a therapeutic
package, in combination with a main therapeutic approach
such as cognitive behavioral therapy (Lehrer, Woolfolk, &
Sime, 2007). Outcome studies generally support the
efficacy of relaxation in the various domains where it has
been applied. However, while PMR is the most popular
technique in clinical settings, the myriad of existing RT
techniques and the areas they are applied need to be taken
into account when considering generalized statements
relating to efficacy.
Indeed, Poppen (1998) criticized the "cookbook" fashion
in which RTs are slotted into existing therapeutic regimes, a
practice that he felt is born out of viewing relaxation as a
straightforward outcome that can be achieved by applying
whichever RT is most convenient. A number of authors
have noted that more consideration should be given to the
specific effects of RT on different symptoms (e.g., Lazarus
& Mayne, 1990).
Another issue with integrating RT with other forms of
therapy is the potential interaction between the wider
therapeutic approach and the process of relaxation itself. As
we outline the relaxation process, the importance of how
the RT practitioners interpret and interact with their own
thoughts and other private events will become apparent. So
too will the role of the wider therapeutic philosophy in
either facilitating an approach to private events that is either
conducive or detrimental to the relaxation process.
Relaxation
The term relaxation can be ambiguous, in that it is often used
interchangeably to refer to three distinct ideas: the state of
being relaxed, the physiological and psychological process of
becoming relaxed, and the technique or exercise used to
promote or achieve relaxation. To avoid confusion, we will
differentiate by referring to the state of being relaxed, the
relaxation process, and relaxation techniques respectively,
with the term relaxation referring to the overall concept.
Being relaxed could be described as a state of
equilibrium that is free from both physical and
psychological tension, which ultimately culminates in the
subjective experience of "being relaxed." The relaxed state
is subjective in that it differs from one person to another: In
the same way that stress relates to perceived demands and
the individual's perceived inability to meet those demands,
relaxation is not necessarily an absence of all potential
stressors, rather a sense that they are not overwhelming.
This sense of well-being is also dependent on the absence
of sympathetic physiological activity, signaled by low heart
rate, slowed breathing, and reduced muscle tension.
Somatic Responding
The objective indicators of relaxation are muscular tension
and activity of the ANS. When a person is relaxed, they
generally have low levels of tension in the skeletal muscular
system and reduced sympathetic activity in the ANS,
characterized by lower oxygen consumption, slower heart,
and lower blood pressure (Benson, 1975).
The list of techniques that come under the label of
relaxation is not exhaustive. However, exercises that are
common to most relaxation techniques attempt to directly
Wilson et al. 3
engage one or both of the muscular or autonomic systems.
PMR involves extensive training to discriminate between
different levels of muscular tension and has seen a number
of iterations and abbreviated versions since its inception
(Bernstein, Carlson, & Schmidt, 2007). The autonomic
component of relaxation is accessed through various
techniques, which aim to reduce sympathetic arousal and
promote a state of "parasympathetic inhibition" (Beary et
al., 1974). Breathing exercises, for example, aim to regulate
and lower rate of breathing resulting in slower heart rate
and lower blood pressure (McCaul, Solomon, & Holmes,
1979). Biofeedback allows the practitioners to regulate their
own autonomic activity by giving a continuous visual or
aural feedback indicating increases or decreases in arousal
(Tarler-Benlolo, 1978). Even in techniques that might
emphasize one type of responding, there is an awareness of
the holistic nature of the process. For example, while never
directly addressed in the exercise, Jacobson noted that PMR
resulted in physiological arousal (Lichstein, 1988). While
Benson (1975) emphasized mantra and breathing exercises,
he noted the role of muscular tension by emphasizing the
importance of comfortable posture.
Cognition
What makes the relaxation process the focus of continued
fascination and study is that somatic responses are only part
of the equation. Relaxation also involves a cognitive
component, where previous experience, expectations, and
current physical and emotional state all enter awareness and
are evaluated while engaging in a technique. By its nature,
relaxation involves increased self-focus, where attention is
directed toward (or away from) thoughts and other private
events that occur while trying to relax (Bond et al., 2009).
In addition, there is a level of meta-responding, where the
presence or absence of these events is evaluated to measure
the overall success of the exercise (Hayes, Hirsch, &
Mathews, 2010; Heide & Borkovec, 1984). While
techniques such as mantra (repetition of a single word or
phrase) attempt to limit the amount of self-talk during
relaxation by focusing attention on a single word or phrase,
all of the major models of relaxation acknowledge the fact
that errand thoughts will occur.
The predominant view is that a position of passivity
should be adopted toward such intrusions (Lichstein, 1988).
In general, passivity is described as a neutral, disinterested
position toward thoughts that enter awareness. However,
the concept has been used in a number of ways, to describe
a practitioner's intention (how they define being relaxed),
attention (how they attend to private events during the
relaxation process), and evaluation (how they interpret
these events). In each case, the term passivity has slightly
different connotations.
Intention. Passivity has been used to describe the view a
practitioner should adopt toward the overall goal of the
relaxation technique. Benson (Beary et al., 1974; Benson,
1975) suggested that practitioners should begin relaxation
techniques with a "passive attitude" and not focus directly
on the outcome of the technique. He described passivity as
not worrying about how well the technique is being
performed. Jacobson (1951) warned against over-
emphasizing the outcome of PMR in case it led
practitioners to check how well they were following it,
believing that this would disrupt progress. Davidson and
Schwartz (1976) describe a detached attitude toward the
functional outcome of the technique being engaged in.
Evaluation. Passivity is also advocated in terms of how an
individual interprets private events. Thoughts or sensations
that occur during relaxation can be viewed as aversive (to
be avoided or removed) or benign (to be tolerated). This
evaluation can have a direct affect on physiological activity.
For example, Ray et al. (2009) found that the strength of
physiological responses to a novel stimulus were
determined more by whether or not the participant
evaluated the stimulus as negative beforehand, than their
arousal level prior to stimulus presentation. It is, therefore,
important that unintended private events are considered to
be part of the relaxation experience, as opposed to
unwanted intrusions.
Attention. Attention relates to the manner in which a
practitioner observes psychological and physiological
events that occur while engaging in a relaxation exercise. It
is commonly described along two dimensions: direction
(self- or externally-focused) and activity (active or passive;
Bond et al., 2009; Davidson & Schwartz, 1976).
The direction of attention in relaxation is considered to
be self-focused, in that focus is directed toward
physiological or psychological activity. Practitioners are
instructed to attend to their rate of breathing as they slow
their breath, their level of muscle tension as they learn to
relax certain muscles, or their thoughts as they engage in
meditation.
However, not all events should be attended to in the same
way. Davidson and Schwartz (1976) distinguish between
passive and active attention, where active is effortful and
passive is not. Active attention should be directed toward the
current activity (e.g., breathing exercises), while all other
private events (e.g., thoughts or physical sensations) should
only be passively attended to. Similarly, Benson (1975)
instructed practitioners to disregard any thoughts that occur
while engaging in the relaxation exercise and redirect
attention toward the technique.
Paradoxical Effects
As well-documented as the process of relaxation has
become, the fact remains that attempts to relax are not
always effective. Indeed, there continue to be documented
cases of RIP and RIA, where attempts to relax actually lead
4 SAGE Open
to a state of increased arousal or anxiety. Individuals who
experience this phenomenon are unable to become
proficient at relaxation and can become upset by their
heightened awareness of the changing internal states
associated with relaxation (Lazarus & Mayne, 1990).
Lazarus and Mayne (1990) suggested that RIA and RIP
type outcomes could be avoided if the chosen technique
was appropriate to the symptoms being alleviated.
However, other explanations for the cause of the
paradoxical effects phenomenon and the wide variety of
techniques that have elicited these effects suggest
commonalities across sufferers and the importance of the
passivity concept. Heide and Borkovec (1984) outlined
what they considered to be some of the features of RIA: (a)
aversion to (ostensibly positive) private events that occur as
a result of relaxation, (b) attempting to achieve relaxation
through effort to control experiences, (c) focusing attention
on anxious thoughts that enter awareness, (d) unwillingness
to generally attend to internal events, and (e) worrisome
cognitive activity unrelated to relaxation.
The points outlined by Heide and Borkovec (1984)
suggest that RIA is likely to occur when an individual
attempts to avoid or control private events that occur during
relaxation. Of particular note is the first point, which
emphasizes the subjective nature of this phenomenon. That
is, physiological or psychological changes that occur during
relaxation, some of which are actually associated with
achieving a relaxed state, are all evaluated by the individual
as aversive. As such, they attempt to achieve relaxation by
gaining control over such experiences.
Wegner et al. (1997) explained how these attempts to
gain control could lead to increased arousal. He suggests
that once control is sought, the individual begins to monitor
for any intrusive thoughts, to suppress or remove them. It is
suggested that this disrupts the relaxation process in two
ways. First, instead of passively attending to private events,
the practitioner is now actively and continuously
monitoring for their presence, so that they can be
suppressed. This itself can increase arousal (Jacobson,
1931). Second, attempts to suppress have been shown to
disrupt physiological habituation to events. In a sense, each
new anxious thought is treated as a novel stimulus, whose
presence was never allowed and therefore never habituated
to, so that the strength of the somatic response does not
diminish over time (Ray et al., 2009; Wegner, 1994). The
role of passivity then is to adopt a position toward private
events that allows them to occur, facilitating habituation
and leading diminished physiological and emotional
responses to new events over time.
Problems With Passivity
RIA and RIP might be considered as extreme examples of
what can take place during relaxation. It could be argued
that where they occur, the process of relaxation has been
misinterpreted: as an exercise in effortful control, rather
than passive habituation. However, there is evidence to
suggest that relaxation is indeed interpreted in this manner.
For example, Wegner et al. (1997) demonstrated that the
instruction "to relax" resulted in larger increases in
physiological arousal, when engaged in a stress-inducing
task, compared with those who were not so instructed. They
argue that relaxation is open to interpretation as an exercise
in suppression or avoidance, and in fact, it is commonly
viewed this way. The authors suggest that increased
cognitive load at the time might constitute the difference
between there being no paradoxical effects and the type of
increased arousal associated with RIA and RIP.
It is important therefore that passivity is communicated
as an integral part of relaxation. Given that relaxation is a
very verbal process, involving constant reflection on
physical and psychological events, the language used to
articulate an idea such as passivity becomes especially
relevant. Depending on how passivity is described, it is
possible that the instruction to "be passive" could be
misinterpreted in the same way that the instruction "to
relax" often is. Here, we outline the potential difficulties
that could arise when attempting to communicate the role of
passivity in relaxation. We suggest that if the goal of
relaxation is to facilitate habituation to private events, then
there are a number of key points that need to be understood.
Intention: Identifying the Goal
To the practitioner, the main goal of relaxation is to "not
feel anxious." As such, directly addressing this anxiety
seems like the obvious first step in achieving this aim.
When advocating passivity, we are asking the practitioner
not to do this. Instead, we are suggesting that they attend to
all private events that occur and experience them fully
without attempting to avoid, modify, or control them.
Previously for the practitioner, relaxation was the absence
of these feelings. Now, a new indicator is needed to
rationalize an experiential as opposed to avoidant approach.
In other words, "Why should I allow myself to experience
all of the thoughts and sensations that I associate with
anxiety--the very state I do not want to be in?"
Smith (1996) acknowledged the difficulty of advocating
passivity for its own sake. He suggested that the practitioner
should learn to adopt "a personal philosophy of passivity"
in their daily lives, where the locus of control is outside of
the relaxation exercise. The goal for relaxation cannot be
the removal of thoughts, emotions, or physical sensations,
as this is the same control-oriented approach that lead to the
aforementioned paradoxical effects. Instead, a larger
external goal must be identified, such as the actions in life
that the anxiety was heretofore preventing. With this
external task set as the "real" goal of relaxation,
fluctuations in somatic arousal or the presence of unwanted
thoughts that occur during relaxation no longer need to
constitute a failure to relax, so long as there is movement
toward the external goal.
Wilson et al. 5
Evaluation: Severing the Link Between Internal Events
and Anxiety
A fearful reaction toward bodily sensations or other private
events that have been previously associated with panic or
anxiety is a well-known mediator of the anxiety process
(Smits, Powers, Cho, & Telch, 2004). In an attempt to
determine the mechanism of change in cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) treatments of panic disorder, Smits et al.
(2004) found that a reduction in fear of fear (FOF)
accounted for the largest variance in symptom reduction.
It is difficult for practitioners to adopt a passive view of
such private events, when they are so inextricably tied to
the aversive experience. Simply advocating passivity does
nothing to sever this link. It is important to take steps to
actively disrupt this link, so that private events may be
viewed as benign and not as signals of an impending
unwanted experience.
Attention: Clarifying What Is Active and What Is
Passive
It is difficult to describe passivity in a manner that
articulates the correct balance between activity and
inactivity. On the one hand, it is possible that passivity
could be interpreted simply as a lack of activity, in that the
aim is to observe and not react to thoughts. However, it
would be incorrect to say that passivity is the same as doing
nothing, as clearly it is a specific type of response to
observed private events. Ironically, it is also possible that
passivity could be interpreted as an activity. Phrases such as
"clearing the mind," "letting go," or "observing" are all
used to communicate this process in relaxation exercises. It
is worth noting that linguistically, all of these terms imply
two things: (a) some type of activity is necessary and (b)
that activity involves directly addressing private events.
In fact, what we are trying to communicate with these
phrases is an ongoing willingness to experience unpleasant
private events, described by Smith (1999) as receptivity. If,
as we said previously, private events must be allowed to
occur to habituate them, then there must be a willingness to
allow them to occur. Maintaining this willingness is the
active element in relaxation.
Acceptance
There are a number of functional similarities between the
passivity component of relaxation and psychological
acceptance. Acceptance emphasizes being able to remain in
contact with private events, rather than trying to reduce
their occurrence (Barnes-Holmes et al., 2004). ACT (Hayes
et al., 1999) incorporates acceptance and mindfulness as
well as focusing on valued action. From an ACT
perspective, the paradoxical effects of effortful relaxation
are not unexpected, given the ACT position that attempts to
alter the form of frequency of internal events can lead to
psychological problems (Kashdan, Barrios, Forsyth, &
Steger, 2006).
ACT also comprises a number of techniques, which are
designed to show the futility of experiential avoidance and
facilitate acceptance. In this section, we will outline the
components of ACT that are comparable to the various
stages of relaxation outlined previously.
Intention: Valued Action as the Goal
Personal values can be described as desirable, trans-
situational concepts or beliefs concerning life goals (Biber,
Hupfeld, & Meier, 2008). Essentially, what people consider
important. Valued actions are those steps taken by an
individual towards their personal values. The concept of
values is not strictly limited to ACT; however, the ACT
approach has been commended for the fact that it addresses
values so explicitly and directly (Arch & Craske, 2008).
Barrow and Prosen (1981) identified the importance of
values clarification in relaxation as part of their model for
stress and counseling interventions, a multi-point model of
the stress process. Within this model, the authors outline the
interaction between internal and external demands that
takes place when first situational variables and then internal
events are perceived to be "out of control" of the individual.
As part of their approach, they suggest that values
clarification is necessary so that the emphasis in relaxation
is not placed entirely on the internal struggle, which can
often descend into maladaptive self-talk and focus on
regulation of internal psychological and physical states.
Recent literature in the area of pain tolerance has
exemplified the potential benefits of identifying values in
facilitating acceptance of aversive physical states.
McCracken and Yang (2006) found that success in valued
action facilitated acceptance as opposed to avoidance of
pain, in chronic pain sufferers. Similarly, Garcia, Villa,
Cepeda, Cueto, and Montes (2004) found that an
acceptance-based intervention that centered on values
allowed athletes to accept the presence of certain bodily
states and private events during an exercise and focus on
increasing their performance.
Branstetter-Rost, Cushing, and Douleh (2009) found that
the inclusion of the values component in an acceptance-
based intervention led to significantly greater tolerance of
pain in a cold-pressor task compared with an intervention
without the values component. This indicates that the
identification of personal values prior to engaging in a
relaxation exercise may create a context where changes in
physical or psychological states are more acceptable, due to
the presence of a greater external goal.
Evaluation: Defusion
Fusion is the idea that thoughts must be countered or acted
upon if they are acknowledged because they in some way
reflect external reality or are a precursor to an inevitable
6 SAGE Open
chain of events, such as becoming anxious. This perspective
has been discussed in relation to anxiety with the FOF
hypothesis, wherein the thoughts and bodily sensations
associated with the anxious state during a previous
distressing experience become as feared as the original
events that precipitated the anxiety. Any appearance of
similar thoughts or sensations is then interpreted as a signal
that the anxious state is about to reoccur.
Within this sequence, we can see the strong association
between what could be an isolated and quite common
private event (an errand thought or an awareness of
physiological change) and an eventual state of anxiety,
leading to the evaluation that any such event is unwanted
and should be tackled. Here, the private event functions as
an aversive stimulus that elicits further verbal and
physiological responses.
In ACT, this view, that thoughts are literal reflections of
reality, is known as fusion. ACT takes a different
perspective: that thoughts are not literal and so do not need
to be responded to. Strategies such paradox, mindfulness,
and cognitive distancing aim to break the symbolic
relationship between thought and external reality by
disrupting how the thoughts function, rather than trying to
directly modify their content or frequency (for a full
theoretical outline of defusion, see Blackledge, 2007).
Recent studies have begun to demonstrate the positive
effects of defusion (e.g., Healy et al., 2008). In addition,
recent findings by Hayes et al. (2010) exemplified exactly
how defusion might be beneficial in the relaxation process.
The authors found that facilitating a benign attentional bias
reduces the frequency of negative thought intrusions. This
indicates that once the tendency to evaluate private events
as negative is altered, the events themselves will occur less
frequently. This finding is particularly interesting as it
demonstrates a way around the relaxation paradox: While
attempting to directly reduce the frequency of events may
cause paradoxical increases, their occurrence can be
reduced indirectly by facilitating a benign approach.
Defusion is one potential way this can be achieved.
Attention: Acceptance and Willingness
The identification of personal values and the concept of
defusion could be considered to take place outside of the
relaxation "exercise," be it PMR, focused berating, or a
meditative technique. Once personal values have been
identified and the process of defusion begun, there is a need
to identify what a practitioner should do during the exercise
when aversive private events occur.
Previously is has been suggested that the individual
should "passively attend" to any such events, while actively
attending to the relaxation technique (Davidson &
Schwartz, 1976). However, it could be argued that the
active/passive dichotomy is misleading, particularly in
relation to passive attention, in that it suggests that no
reaction to private events should take place. Given the
aversive nature of these thoughts and bodily states, it would
seem that the very act of allowing them to take place
requires some effort on the part of the individual. Such an
effort would have a markedly different function than trying
to avoid or suppress events, but it would be an effort
nonetheless. Smith (1999) recognizes this in his ABC
relaxation model, wherein he identifies a need for
"receptivity" to these events. Receptivity implies the
opposite of avoidance, while also implying an ongoing
conscious decision to allow events to occur.
In ACT, there are separate but inextricably linked
concepts of "acceptance" and "willingness." In terms of
process, willingness to experience unwanted thoughts and
states is necessary to accept them. Willingness therefore, is
the active attentional element when it comes to dealing with
aversive private events as they occur: Prior to the events
entering awareness, the individual makes the conscious
decision of being willing to experience them. Acceptance is
the passive element in that events are experienced without
attempts to modify or control them. A recent study by
Wilson, Barnes-Holmes, and Barnes-Holmes (2014) found
that an ACT-based intervention demonstrated different
patterns of physiological responding in an anxiety-inducing
situation than other strategies including mindfulness and
placebo, suggesting that effective mitigation of anxiety
responses is more than "doing nothing."
Willingness is directly addressed in ACT and linked to
the personal values of the individual. Once personal values
have been identified, willingness to experience short-term
discomfort is discussed in terms of movement toward long-
term personal values. Increased willingness to experience
aversive states has already been found to be associated with
decreased experiential avoidance and positive changes in
anxiety (Twohig, Hayes, & Masuda, 2006).
ACT and Relaxation Comparisons
Although we mentioned previously that it is common
practice to integrate RTs into larger therapeutic techniques,
experimental studies often examine them in isolation,
comparing their efficacy directly with other therapeutic
approaches such as CBT. The rationale for such
comparisons is, of course, to broaden the range of effective
treatment options for any particular disorder, by comparing
a new technique with one were the efficacy has already
been established. Twohig et al. (2010), for example, found
that ACT produced favorable outcomes on a number of
post-treatment measures of OCD, when compared with
progressive RT.
However, it could be argued that where relaxation has
been proven to be effective, some of the mechanisms for
change that facilitate positive outcomes with the new
approach are largely present in the RT as well (Smits et al.,
2004). In addition, RT in some form is often added to
therapeutic approaches wherever anxiety or stress-reduction
is necessary because of its role in reducing somatic arousal
Wilson et al. 7
(Poppen, 1998). Rather than view relaxation techniques as a
separate entity, it would seem more productive to identify
those elements within RTs that facilitate change and
highlight them in the therapy being combined with. This
would potentially lead to more effective and holistic results.
Conclusion
This article argues that acceptance and passivity are
functionally similar concepts. However, acceptance from
this perspective appears to offer a number of distinct
advantages: (a) It is intuitively easier to work out what
you are required to do when you are accepting, especially
when willingness is incorporated, rather than when you
are being passive. Put simply, it is easier to learn how to
"be willing to have the feelings that are showing up" than
to learn to "let go," "calm down," or "do nothing." (b) The
link between acceptance and personal values also gives
your therapeutic efforts meaning, especially in a context
where you are being asked to accept psychological content
that is unpleasant or aversive. So, for relaxation you not
only know how to accept your content, but you also know
that you are doing this in an effort to move toward what
you value. Hence, acceptance and values, however they
are conceptualized, are a necessary part of effective
relaxation.
Traditional descriptions of relaxation emphasized the
importance of passivity toward thoughts and sensations, yet
there was little in the way of explanation of "how to be
passive" because passivity is easily but incorrectly
interpreted as the absence of activity. In contrast, there is
reason to conceptualize passivity as a more than this by
acknowledging the necessary willingness to experience
events. This is supported by studies such as Wilson et al.
(2014), where different patterns of physiological responding
were seen from participants who did nothing, compared
with an intervention that incorporated a willingness
element.
Finally, we suggest that integration of the principles of
relaxation into larger therapeutic approaches offers a more
complete understanding of how relaxation works or does
