Global Assessment of Physical Activity in Women Sternfeld et al.
Assessment of Physical Activity with a Single Global Question in a Large,
Multiethnic Sample of Midlife Women
Barbara Sternfeld,1 Jane Cauley,2 Sioban Harlow,3 Gao Liu,1 and Marion Lee4
This study compared responses from 13,621 African-American, Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese, and White
women to a single, global physical activity question. Respondents aged 40­55 years were randomly selected
from seven geographic locations in the United States for the 1996­1997 cross-sectional survey of the Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation, a longitudinal, observational study of the menopause transition.
Respondents rated their activity level as much less, less, the same as, more, or much more than other women
their age. Physical activity rating varied minimally by race/ethnicity. The proportions of women who rated
themselves much less active and much more active ranged from 3.1% for Whites to 4.8% for Japanese and from
13.6% for Japanese to 16.4% for African Americans, respectively. Multiple logistic regression models, stratified
by race/ethnicity, showed independent associations between a low level of activity and higher body mass index,
poor health, functional impairment, perceived stress, difficulty sleeping, and not being employed. A high level of
activity was associated with excellent health, single marital status, higher education, lower body mass index, and
older age. These findings suggest that a comparative rating of physical activity may rank women by activity level
within a specific racial/ethnic group but may not capture differences across racial/ethnic groups. Am J Epidemiol

Physical activity is a complex behavior that encompasses
such disparate domains as sports and exercise, occupational
tasks, and household chores. In the broadest sense, physical
activity refers to any bodily movement produced by skeletal
muscles that results in energy expenditure (1). As with other
complex behaviors, such as dietary intake, physical activity
is difficult to measure. Over the past decade, developments
in the methodology of physical activity assessment have
paralleled increased interest in understanding the role of
physical activity in disease prevention and health promotion
(2, 3). Methods of direct measurement, such as accelerome-
ters, have become more sophisticated, practical, and valid
(4, 5), and survey methods have expanded to include a wider
range of activities relevant to both men and women (6), to
older persons (7), and to diverse racial and ethnic groups
(8). However, single, global activity questions that ask for
an overall assessment of activity level rather than about par-
ticipation in specific activities or categories of activity are
still desirable, particularly for studies in which physical
activity is not the main variable of interest, and participant
burden and investigator expense are major concerns.
A number of studies have found that global questions can
be used to rank people roughly by activity level and to dif-
ferentiate those who participate in vigorous exercise from
those who do not (9­12). However, the relatively low corre-
lations between global questions and more detailed assess-
ments of activity suggest that respondents may use different
constructs for responding to these two types of activity mea-
sures. To date, little is known about how people translate
their specific behavior into the general concept of physical
activity level. This problem is exacerbated when a global
question is used in a racially and ethnically diverse popula-
tion in which the meaning and value of physical activity
may not be commonly shared.
The purpose of the present study was to compare
responses to a global physical activity question in a large,
community-based sample of midlife African-American,
Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese, and White women and to
examine the correlates of high and low rating of activity
within and across the different racial/ethnic groups.
Specifically, this study examined the race-/ethnic-specific
relation between a comparative self-rating of physical activ-
ity and demographic and health status variables known or
hypothesized to be associated with varying levels of activity
in the population to evaluate whether this global question
appears to measure the same construct in different ethnic
groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sample
As part of the Study of Women's Health Across the
Nation, 16,065 women aged 40­55 years in seven geo-
graphic areas of the United States were interviewed by tele-
phone, or infrequently in person (about 10 percent of the
total sample, limited to those sampling units for which tele-
phone numbers could not be determined), to provide cross-
sectional data on the health status of midlife women and to
screen for eligibility for the prospective cohort study.
Sampling of women, described in detail in Sowers et al.
(13), was based on either random digit dialing or list-based
sampling frames; one of four specific racial/ethnic commu-
nities was oversampled at each site (African Americans in
Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; the Detroit area of
Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Chinese in
Oakland, California; Hispanics in Newark, New Jersey; and
Japanese in Los Angeles, California). In addition, all seven
of the sites surveyed a random sample of White women. The
sampling strategies were designed to produce a study sam-
ple that was racially/ethnically and socioeconomically
diverse and representative of the various communities from
which the samples were drawn. The overall response rate,
calculated by adding to the denominator of known eligibles
a proportion of sampling units with unknown eligibility
assumed to be eligible, was 46.6 percent and varied by site
from a low of 29.6 percent to a high of 73.7 percent, largely
reflecting differences in sampling frames. Although, as dis-
cussed by Sowers et al., the relatively low response rates at
some sites may limit generalizability, the sampling strate-
gies for the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
successfully achieved a socioeconomically diverse sample
broadly representative of five major racial/ethnic groups in
the United States (13).
Of 16,065 women who completed the 1996­1997 cross-
sectional survey, 2,444 (15.2 percent) were excluded from
the present analysis. Reasons for exclusion included missing
physical activity data (n  501); mixed race/ethnicity,
race/ethnicity other than the five purposely sampled, or no
specified race/ethnicity (n  426); pregnant at the time of
the interview or no menstrual period in the prior 12 months
because of pregnancy or lactation (n  391); and self-
reported diagnosis of myocardial infarction or angina (n 
431). In addition, women who reported severe functional
limitation, defined as "a lot of difficulty" with walking one
flight of stairs, walking one block, or bathing (n  695),
were excluded since they generally tended to rate them-
selves at the lowest end of the activity spectrum (39 vs. 6.1
percent in the sample as a whole). After exclusions, 13,621
women remained in the sample.
Assessment of physical activity and other covariates
Physical activity was assessed in the cross-sectional sur-
vey by using a single global question that asked women to
rate their level of physical activity as much less, less, the
same as, more, or much more than other women their age.
This comparative self-rating of activity has been used in a
number of previous population-based surveys, including the
1985 National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion/
Disease Prevention Supplement, in which a more detailed
criterion method of measuring activity was also included in
order to evaluate the validity of this and other global activ-
ity questions (11). In that data set, the overall Spearman's
correlation coefficient between the more detailed measure
of energy expenditure and the comparative rating of activity
was 0.29, ranging from 0.41 for persons aged 18­24 years to
0.23 for those aged more than 75 years. Although these cor-
relations are relatively weak, they are comparable to the cor-
relations observed between other global measures and more
extensive physical activity assessments (14).
Although the comparative activity question is a standard
one used in studies of English-speaking populations, to our
knowledge it has not been used previously with non-
English-speaking people. Since the sample for the Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation included women who
spoke Cantonese, Japanese, and Spanish, the entire cross-
sectional survey, including the physical activity question,
was translated into these three languages and then back-
translated into English to ensure the accuracy of the transla-
tions. The back-translation of the original Cantonese activ-
ity question revealed that the meaning had been altered from
the concept of physical activity to physical strength.
Therefore, only the responses from those Chinese-speaking
women who were interviewed after the translation of the
activity question was corrected were included in the present
analysis; the responses of those interviewed prior to that
point (n  63) were set to missing, accounting for 12.6 per-
cent of the 501 women for whom activity data were missing.
The independent variables of primary interest for this
analysis included seven demographic factors and 10 self-
reported indicators of health status; standard questions from
previous population-based surveys were used wherever pos-
sible. For this analysis, the demographic variables were cat-
egorized as follows: 1) age: 40­44/45­49/50­55 years;
2) education: high school graduate or less/more than high
school graduate; 3) marital status: married or living as mar-
ried/not married, including single, widowed, separated, or
divorced; 4) number of children: none/one or two/three or
more; 5) employment status: working for pay outside the
home (either full-time or part-time)/not working; 6) ability
to pay for basic family needs: very difficult/somewhat
difficult/not at all difficult; and 7) interview language, a
crude marker of acculturation.
The 10 indicators of health status were categorized as fol-
lows: 1) overall self-reported health: excellent or very good/
good/fair or poor; 2) overall quality of life indicated on a 10-
point scale, with higher indicating better quality: seven or
less/eight or more; 3) number of diagnosed medical condi-
tions (high blood pressure, osteoporosis, fibroids, cancer,
diabetes): none/one or more; 4) number of symptoms expe-
rienced during the previous 2 weeks (hot flashes; night
sweats; forgetfulness; irritability; feeling blue or depressed;
feeling tense or nervous; vaginal dryness; leaking urine;
pounding or racing heart; stiff or sore joints, neck, or shoul-
ders; headaches): three or less/four or more; 5) difficulty
sleeping during the previous 2 weeks: yes/no; 6) perceived

stress level based on Cohen et al.'s four-item perceived
stress scale (15), with a higher score indicating greater
stress: eight or less/more than eight; 7) any functional limi-
tation, defined as any limitation on activity due to impair-
ment or health problems: yes/no; 8) a five-level menopausal
status variable: premenopause and early perimenopause (at
least one menstrual cycle within the previous 3 months with
or without change in regularity)/late perimenopause (no
period for 3­12 months)/postmenopause (no period for
more than 12 months)/surgical menopause (hysterectomy
and/or bilateral oophorectomy)/hormone user (current use
of hormones with undetermined status); 9) smoking status:
current smoker/not current smoker; and 10) body mass
index (BMI), calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared, from self-reported height and
weight.
Statistical analysis
The distributions of all independent variables, except
BMI, were examined across the five-level physical activity
rating by using proportions and were evaluated with the chi-
square statistic. For BMI, which was treated as a continuous
variable, means and standard deviations were calculated by
activity level, and differences were evaluated by using
analysis of variance. Similar descriptive and analytical sta-
tistics were used to examine the associations between
race/ethnicity and the other independent variables.
Because the correlates of a low level of activity may not
be merely the inverse of the correlates of a high level of
activity, separate logistic regression analyses, stratified by
racial/ethnic group, were used to examine two distinct sets
of relations: 1) the associations between the independent
variables and a reported low activity level relative to an
average activity level (the same as one's peers) and 2) the
associations between the independent variables and a
reported high activity level relative to an average activity
level. Average activity level was selected as the reference
category to focus on sedentary behavior on the one hand and
a highly active lifestyle on the other. Initially, only the
extreme levels of activity (1 vs. 3, 5 vs. 3) were modeled.
However, because small sample sizes in these extreme cate-
gories limited the statistical power, particularly for the
Chinese and Japanese women, for whom the overall sample
sizes were smaller, and because relations were similar when
categories 1 and 2 (much less and less activity than one's
peers) and categories 4 and 5 (more and much more activ-
ity) were combined, all of the data presented here were
based on the combined categories.
To assess the independent associations between demo-
graphic factors and indicators of health status and a low or
high level of activity, multivariable logistic regression mod-
els included all variables that were statistically significant at
the p < 0.05 level in unadjusted analyses. Variables were then
selected for final, race-/ethnic-specific multivariable models
if they continued to show a statistically significant relation to
the outcome in that particular racial/ethnic group or in at
least three of the other racial/ethnic groups. The common
variables included in all of the final, race-/ethnic-specific
multivariable models were 1) BMI, overall health status, per-
ceived stress level, functional limitation, sleep problems, and
employment status for activity less than one's peers relative
to average activity level and 2) BMI, overall health status,
age, marital status, and education for activity more than one's
peers relative to average activity level. These final models
provided race-/ethnic-specific estimates of the odds ratios
and 95 percent confidence intervals associated with specific
demographic and health status variables. Goodness of fit of
each model was examined by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow
test. All analyses were conducted with SAS software, version
6.11 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the sample
As shown in table 1, the sample was almost equally
divided between Whites and other racial/ethnic groups, and
slightly more than 40 percent of the women reported that
paying for basics was very difficult or somewhat difficult.
More than a third had a high school education or less. The
sample was relatively uniformly distributed within the spec-
ified age range (40­55 years), but more than half were either
premenopausal or early perimenopausal. Although only 14
percent rated their overall health as fair or poor, more than
half reported one or more chronic medical conditions, and
more than a third reported difficulty sleeping.
All of the demographic characteristics and indicators of
health status varied significantly by race/ethnicity (data not
shown). For instance, only 38.3 percent of the Hispanic
women had more than a high school education compared
with 79.8 percent of the Japanese women. Only 7.0 percent
of the Whites considered their health to be fair or poor com-
pared with 31.4 percent of the Hispanics. In contrast, only
7.9 percent of the Hispanics, but 15.8 percent of the Whites,
reported any functional limitation. The Chinese group had
the lowest proportion of any diagnosed chronic condition
(33.9 percent) and also the lowest proportion of current
smokers (2.2 percent), while African Americans had the
highest proportions (70.1 and 28.0 percent, respectively).
Distribution of comparative rating of physical activity
Despite the relatively large racial/ethnic differences in
demographic characteristics and indicators of health status,
the variations in rating of physical activity by race/ethnicity,
although statistically significant, were slight (table 1).
Among those women who rated themselves as much less
active than their peers, the proportions only ranged from a
low of 3.1 percent of the Whites to 4.8 percent of the
Japanese. At the high end, the proportion of women rating
themselves as much more active ranged from 13.6 percent
of the Japanese to 16.4 percent of the African Americans, a
difference of only 2.8 percentage points. Somewhat more
variation existed in the proportions rating themselves as
having the same level of activity as their peers; about 40 per-
cent of the African Americans, Japanese, and Whites placed
themselves in that category compared with 45.3 percent of
the Chinese and 52.6 percent of the Hispanics.

In contrast, the magnitude of the variation in physical
activity rating by other demographic and health status vari-
ables was more notable (table 1). Only 1.5 percent of those
who considered their overall health to be excellent or very
good, but 12.2 percent of those rating their health as fair or
poor, considered themselves much less active than their
peers. Conversely, 20.3 percent of those who reported their
health to be excellent or very good rated themselves as
much more active than their peers compared with only 7.3
percent of those reporting fair or poor health. Also, rela-
tively more women with any functional limitation consid-
ered themselves much less active than those with no limita-
tions (10.4 vs. 2.6 percent), while the opposite was true for
those rating themselves as much more active (9.8 percent of
those with vs. 16.2 percent of those without functional lim-
itation). BMI declined steadily across the five activity cate-
gories, from a mean of 31.8 kg/m2 at the low end to a mean
of 24.7 kg/m2 at the high end.
Even when differences were not so pronounced, the
relations generally were in the expected direction. For
instance, a higher proportion of women with more than a
high school education compared with women with less
education considered themselves much more active (16.9
vs. 12.4 percent), while 16.4 percent of employed women
reported being much more active compared with 11.6 per-
cent of those not working. Similarly, women with a high
quality of life and lower stress levels were overrepre-
sented in the higher activity categories, while those with a
lower quality of life and more stress were overrepresented
in the lower categories. Only menopausal status and
smoking status showed little relation to physical activity
rating.
Independent correlates of activity less than one's peers
Multivariable models, developed from simple logistic
regression analyses (as described above), showed that some
of the demographic and health status factors were indepen-
dently and consistently related to a physical activity level
less than one's peers (relative to the same as) in all or
mostly all of the racial/ethnic groups. However, other fac-
tors associated with low activity levels were observed in
only one or two of the groups. Specifically, as shown in
table 2, higher BMI, fair/poor health, and having any func-
tional impairment showed a significant direct association
with low activity level in all groups except the Japanese,
while a higher perceived stress level and not being
employed were significant factors except in the Chinese
and Japanese groups. Having sleep problems was a signifi-
cant factor in all groups of women except the Chinese and
Hispanics. In contrast, older age, excellent/very good
health, and higher quality of life showed a significant
inverse relation with low activity rating for the African
Americans and Whites only, as did having three or more
children for those in the Hispanic and White groups. A
higher number of symptoms and not being married were
associated with low activity rating for only the Hispanics,
while completing the interview in Spanish showed an
inverse association.
Independent correlates of activity more than one's peers
As summarized in table 3, multivariable analysis of fac-
tors associated with activity more than one's peers, relative
to average activity, also showed both consistency and incon-
sistency across the racial/ethnic groups. For instance, BMI
had a significant independent, inverse relation and excel-
lent/very good health a significant independent, direct rela-
tion in all racial/ethnic groups except the Chinese, for whom
there was a suggestive relation. In addition, being single was
significantly related to an increased likelihood of a high
activity rating in all five groups; in four of the five groups,
older age and higher education were directly associated,
while not being employed was inversely associated. A
higher level of perceived stress was associated with a
reduced likelihood of a high activity level only for African
Americans and Whites (not significant), while a higher qual-
ity of life was related to an increased likelihood only for
Whites. Completing the interview in Japanese was associ-
ated with increased odds of a high activity rating, and a site
difference was indicated for African Americans (the only
other racial/ethnic group represented at more than one site
was Whites, for whom no site difference was observed) that
suggested an increased odds of a high activity rating in
Michigan relative to Pittsburgh.
DISCUSSION
This study of the correlates of comparative rating of phys-
ical activity level in a large, multiethnic cohort of midlife
women found only minimal racial/ethnic differences in self-
reported activity level. In contrast, substantial differences in
activity level across a number of other demographic and
health status variables were observed, and these relations
were generally consistent across the racial/ethnic groups.
Some variables, such as BMI, overall health status, employ-
ment, and, to some extent, age and perceived stress level,
were related to both low and high activity, showing decreased
likelihood of the one and increased likelihood of the other.
Other variables, such as functional limitations, difficulty
sleeping, and number of children, were associated only with
low activity; still others, namely education and marital status,
were more generally associated only with high activity.
The finding within each of the five racial/ethnic groups of
the expected relations between comparative physical activ-
ity rating and established correlates of activity, such as BMI,
overall health status, and employment status (16), suggests
that different races/ethnicities may share a similar construct
for responding to this global question and that it is as valid
for assessing physical activity in non-White populations as
it is in White populations. Therefore, the comparative phys-
ical activity rating may be an appropriate method for assess-
ing activity in large, epidemiologic studies of a single
racial/ethnic population group, in which relative ranking of
activity level, rather than an absolute level, is the exposure
of interest. For such studies, the global comparative rating
may be particularly useful, given its simplicity and ease of
administration either by in-person or telephone interview, as
in the present study, or by self-administration.

However, this study failed to observe any substantial dif-
ferences in rating of physical activity by race/ethnicity.
Fewer than 5 percent of any racial/ethnic group rated them-
selves as much less active than their peers, while between
13.5 and 16.5 percent of each group rated themselves as
much more active. Given national and other survey data (3,
17­19) that consistently report lower levels of regular,
recreational physical activity in minorities, especially
minority women, relative to Whites, the absence of such dif-
ferences in the present study is noteworthy and may have
resulted from the specific wording and intent of the question
itself. Because the question asks respondents for a compar-

ative rating of activity, respondents need a frame of refer-
ence as a standard against which to compare themselves. In
this study, that frame of reference may well have been not
midlife women in general, but women of the respondent's
own racial/ethnic group. If that was the case, then the com-
parative activity rating may not be useful for describing
racial/ethnic differences in physical activity and may not be
suitable for studies examining differences in physical activ-
ity level as predictors of racial/ethnic differences in health
status or incidence of specific disease outcomes.
Although racial/ethnic differences in activity level among
women are well documented and persist even when domains
of activity other than sports and exercise are assessed (6) and
when efforts are made to assess a wide range of culturally
relevant activities (20), little is known about racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in the meaning or interpretation of the concept of
physical activity. In a qualitative study of perceptions and
beliefs about exercise among mostly low-socioeconomic-
status African Americans, focus groups suggested that rest
was more highly valued than exercise and that physically

demanding work was indicative of limited education and
opportunity (21). On the other hand, exercise was thought to
contribute to well-being and to alleviate various health prob-
lems. A limitation of the current study is the lack of knowl-
edge about how respondents conceptualized physical activity
and whether that conceptualization varied systematically by
race/ethnicity. For instance, did women from one racial/
ethnic group interpret the question primarily in terms of
sports and exercise, while those from another group respond
more in terms of "busy-ness" and their social roles (22)?
The inverse relation between low activity rating and num-
ber of children generally observed in this study, and the
direct relation with unemployment, may indicate that, on
some level, all women interpreted this global question about

physical activity as much in terms of the activities they do
in daily life as in terms of organized sports or exercise.
Since occupational activity levels may be relatively high for
some women, particularly in some racial/ethnic groups, and
household and caregiving activities account for a large pro-
portion of most women's total daily energy expenditure,
physical activity instruments that tend to focus more on vig-
orous exercise may tend to underestimate women's true
activity level (23). In that sense, the comparative rating of
activity may be a more valid measure for women than other
global questions, such as the number of times of sweating
from exertion per week, particularly for differentiating
women at the lower levels of activity.
Previous studies of the descriptive epidemiology of phys-
ical activity have consistently found that younger age and
higher socioeconomic status are associated with higher lev-

els of recreational activity (24). In the present study, in
which the age range was narrow and included only the
midlife years (age 40­55 years), older age was associated
with higher activity. This finding may be chance or may
reflect a widening gap between the perception of one's own
activity level and the average activity level of one's peers as
one ages. It also may reflect a true change in women's
opportunities to engage in diverse activities as they move
from one life stage to another (such as full-time employment
to retirement), although the lack of association of
menopausal status with either high or low activity level sug-
gests that chronologic age, or the social meaning of chrono-
logic age, may define life stages more than hormonal events
do, at least in terms of physical activity behavior.
On the other hand, consistent with previous literature (24,
25), this study found that higher education, one dimension of
socioeconomic status, was associated with a high activity rat-
ing while unemployment was inversely associated with high
activity and directly associated with low activity. In addition,
being single was related to high activity but not to low activ-
ity (except in Hispanics). Taken together, this constellation of
factors suggests a picture of the women who rated them-
selves as more active than their peers: educated, employed,
and without family responsibilities, a picture generally con-
sistent with the demographic description of women who reg-
ularly participate in sports and exercise that emerges from
more detailed assessments (6, 26). This consistency suggests
that the comparative rating of physical activity also may be a
valid measure for differentiating more-active women from
those with an average activity level.
Fewer studies have examined the correlates of inactivity or
sedentary behavior. Although national data show that the
demographic characteristics of persons who do not participate
in any recreational physical activity tend to be the inverse of
those who do (less education, non-White, and female) (27),
lack of participation in recreational physical activity does not
necessarily imply lack of activity in all domains, especially
among women (6), nor is sedentary behavior merely the
opposite of physical activity behavior (28). For instance,
heavy television viewing, which may be one measure of
sedentary behavior, has been associated with factors such as
hostility and alcohol consumption that may or may not be
associated with physical activity (29). In the current study,
activity less than one's peers appeared to be less related to low
socioeconomic status and more to a state of poor health, both
overall and in terms of specific complaints (functional impair-
ment and sleeping problems). Unfortunately, given the cross-
sectional nature of these data, it was not possible to determine
the directionality of the observed relations.
From a public health perspective, this study suggests that
different standards of usual or even "appropriate" activity level
may prevail in different racial/ethnic groups. In 1997, the
Surgeon General's report on physical activity and public health
recommended that to achieve health benefits, everybody
should engage in a minimum of moderate-intensity activity for
a total of 30 minutes a day most days of the week (3). Given
the racial and ethnic diversity of the United States, the public
health challenge is to promote efforts that encourage and
enable all groups to accept and follow that recommendation.
