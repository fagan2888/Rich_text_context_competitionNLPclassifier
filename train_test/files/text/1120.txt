Nicotine metabolism has been hypothesized to affect patterns of smoking. The recent development of a non-
invasive measure of nicotine metabolism, the nicotine metabolite ratio (trans-3#-hydroxycotinine/cotinine), makes it
possible to examine the association between rate of nicotine metabolism and smoking behavior in the general
population. This US study examined group differences in the ratio measured in urine and the association between
the ratio and multiple measures of smoking behavior and nicotine dependence in a large, national representative
sample of young adults. The sample included 900 daily smokers aged 18­26 years from wave III (2001­2002) of
the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health. Nicotine dependence was measured by using the
Fagerstro
¨m Test for Nicotine Dependence. Females had higher nicotine metabolite ratios than males; Whites
and Hispanics had higher nicotine metabolite ratios than African Americans or Asians. This finding is consistent
with those from laboratory studies of older smokers based on intravenous infusion of nicotine. No significant
association was found between the nicotine metabolite ratio and number of cigarettes smoked per day or nicotine
dependence. The availability of a noninvasive measure makes possible systematic testing of causal hypotheses
generated by laboratory studies in the general population.

Nicotine is the primary psychoactive component of to-
bacco. Nicotine is metabolized primarily to cotinine (COT),
which is itself metabolized to trans-3#-hydroxycotinine
(3HC) (1). The rate of nicotine metabolism has been hy-
pothesized to affect smoking patterns, including extensive-
ness of smoking, progression of smoking, persistence of
smoking, and nicotine dependence (2­4). Persons who me-
tabolize nicotine rapidly may need to smoke more exten-
sively to achieve the same level of nicotine in the body as
those who metabolize nicotine slowly (5). The liver enzyme
cytochrome P-450 CYP2A6 is primarily responsible for
the metabolism of nicotine to COT and appears to be

exclusively or nearly exclusively responsible for the metab-
olism of COT to 3HC (6­9).
To date, the associations between nicotine metabolism
and smoking behavior have been ascertained from CYP2A6
genetic polymorphisms associated with variation in nicotine
metabolism activity. Results are inconsistent. Some studies
show that adult and adolescent smokers with CYP2A6 gene
variants associated with very slow nicotine metabolism
smoke fewer cigarettes per day than smokers with normal
or intermediate rates of metabolism, whereas those with
a very fast metabolism smoke more cigarettes (2­4, 10­
13). Other studies have failed to find these associations
(e.g., 14­17). Patterns regarding dependence appear to dif-
fer among adolescent and adult smokers. Among adults,
slow metabolism is associated with decreased rates of de-
pendence (4, 10, 18­20). However, one study suggests that
adolescents with a slow metabolism are more likely to pro-
gress to dependence (13). A recent study found that adoles-
cents with the slowest CYP2A6 activity were most likely to
remain current smokers by age 18 years (21).
Examination of the hypothesis that nicotine metabolism
is associated with smoking behavior requires large popula-
tion samples with measures of smoking and nicotine metab-
olism. Until recently, this type of study was unfeasible. The
most direct method for assessing the rate of nicotine me-
tabolism requires intravenous infusion of nicotine and mea-
surement of serial blood levels, which can be accomplished
in a laboratory setting only (22). However, it has recently
been shown that the nicotine metabolite ratio of 3HC to
COT in plasma or saliva is highly correlated with oral clear-
ance of nicotine and is thought to index CYP2A6 activity
(9). 3HC/COT ratios in urine and plasma are highly corre-
lated (9). The 3HC/COT ratio differs significantly in persons
with CYP2A6 gene variants associated with reduced en-
zymatic activity compared with variants associated with
normal activity, although the ratio across gene variant
groupings overlaps considerably (23). The development of
this noninvasive technique makes it possible for the first
time to examine the association between nicotine metabo-
lism and smoking behavior in the general population.
Benowitz et al. (24) used this noninvasive approach in
a self-selected sample of 72 mainly White adult smokers.
The urine nicotine metabolite ratio was significantly corre-
lated with number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD),
especially among Whites, but was uncorrelated with the
Fagerstro
¨m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). The ra-
tio was higher among Whites than other racial/ethnic
groups. These findings replicated those from laboratory
studies that documented extensive racial/ethnic differences
in nicotine metabolism rates. Compared with Whites or
Hispanics, African Americans and Asians metabolize nico-
tine more slowly (25, 26).
In this paper, we describe racial/ethnic differences in the
nicotine metabolite ratio and its association with multiple
measures of smoking behavior, including nicotine depen-
dence, in a subset of a large, national representative sample
of young adult smokers. We also examine the excretion of
nicotine metabolites in urine as indicators of daily intake of
nicotine and their associations with smoking behavior and
nicotine dependence. Because of its large size and multieth-
nic representation, this sample is well suited for examining
subgroup differences in rates of nicotine metabolism. These
differences are of particular interest given the differences
in smoking patterns across racial/ethnic groups documented
in epidemiologic studies. Rates of smoking and nicotine
dependence among young adults are lower for African
Americans than for Whites (27­31).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Source of data
Data were derived from wave III of the National Longi-
tudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a subset
of US participants in a school survey conducted in 1994­
1995 among a national representative sample of 90,118
adolescents in grades 7­12 (32, 33). In 1995 (wave I), rep-
resentative samples of survey participants and nonpartici-
pants were selected for follow-up (mean age, 15.5 years;
standard deviation, 1.7). Siblings and co-twins, if not orig-
inally sampled, were added to generate a genetically infor-
mative sample but were excluded from weighted national
estimates. Wave I interviews were completed with 20,745
adolescents (80 percent participation rate, including 1,821
unweighted cases). In 1996 (wave II), 14,738 of 16,706
wave I adolescents in target grades 7­11 were reinter-
viewed. In 2001­2002, all students interviewed at wave I
were targeted for wave III (n ¼ 20,058), except 687 un-
weighted cases no longer part of the genetic sample because
of a missing pair member or misattribution as a twin. In
wave III, interviews were completed with 15,197 youths
whose mean age was 21.8 years (standard deviation, 1.9)
(75.8 percent participation rate) (refer to the following
website: www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth/). A urine sample was
collected from respondents at a random time. Those not
reinterviewed were slightly older, more likely to be males,
from single-parent families, and more often delinquent
than those interviewed; smoking rates were similar in both
groups.
Analytical sample
At wave III, 2,982 youths (excluding genetic cases) re-
ported smoking on 30 of the last 30 days and were assumed
to have smoked on the survey day. An analytical subsample
of 1,016 cases was selected, which included all the minor-
ities (African Americans (n ¼ 307), Hispanics (n ¼ 274),
and Asians (n ¼ 125)) and a random subsample of Whites to
equal the number of African Americans (n ¼ 310); 904
respondents provided urine samples. The subjects who did
not provide samples did not differ from those who did re-
garding demographic characteristics and smoking patterns.
Since COT has a half-life of 16­20 hours, the current smok-
ers in the analytical sample were expected to have detect-
able COT levels.
The Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory at the University
of California, San Francisco, assayed the urine samples for
COT and 3HC. Four cases whose 3HC or COT values were
lower than 10 ng/ml were excluded because of the mathe-
matical instability of the 3HC/COT ratio at low values.

The analytical sample included 271 Whites, 271 African
Americans, 244 Hispanics, and 114 Asians. Subjects were
aged 18­26 years (mean age, 21.8 years; standard deviation,
2.1 years). Mean educational level was 12.3 years (standard
deviation, 2.7). Add Health could not provide statistical
weights for this selected sample.
Measurement of nicotine metabolites
The urine samples were assayed for COT and 3HC by
using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (9).
Statistical analyses
We calculated descriptive statistics for urine concentra-
tions of COT, 3HC, and the log-transformed 3HC/COT ra-
tio, as well as the distributions of covariates. Multivariate
regressions estimated the association of the logged ratio
with sociodemographic characteristics, smoking history,
nicotine dependence, and body mass index in the total sam-
ple, by gender and race/ethnicity.
Definition of variables
Predicted variables.
 Urine COT: range, 8.3­5,737.3 ng/ml.
 Urine 3HC: range, 12.2­60,537 ng/ml. Two values were
higher than 35,000 ng/ml.
 The 3HC/COT ratio was log transformed in the multi-
variate models.
Covariates.
 Race/ethnicity: non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Afri-
can American, Hispanic, Asian. Of Hispanics, 40.2 per-
cent were uniquely Mexican/Chicano and 23.8 percent
were uniquely Puerto Rican.
 Gender: male, female.

 Education (years).
 Onset age at smoking a whole cigarette.
 CPD: based on the question, ``During the past 30 days,
on the days you smoked, how many cigarettes did you
smoke each day?'' Coded 1­40.
 Current nicotine dependence: measured by the FTND
(34). Respondents were asked about six symptoms
experienced in the last 30 days: 1) time to smoking the
first cigarette of the day; 2) finds it difficult not to smoke
in places where it is forbidden; 3) which cigarette of the
day would most hate to give up; 4) CPD; 5) smokes more
frequently the first 2 hours of the day; 6) smokes even if
ill. Symptoms 1 and 4 were coded 0­3, others 0, 1 (a ¼
0.65). A score of 4 defined nicotine dependence (35).
 Initial sensitivity to smoking experience (modified
Pomerleau et al. scale (36); added two items). Extent
to which smokers experienced each of nine symptoms
with their first few cigarettes. Scored 1 ¼ none to 4 ¼
intense experience. Three scales averaged the scores of
component items: 1) pleasant symptoms (pleasant sensa-
tions, relaxation, pleasurable rush or buzz; a ¼ 0.77);
2) unpleasant symptoms (unpleasant sensations, nausea,
coughing, difficulty inhaling, heart pounding; a ¼ 0.80);
3) dizziness.
 Body mass index: Weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters.
RESULTS
Smoking patterns
On average, these young adults smoked 12 cigarettes per
day and had a low FTND dependence score (table 1). CPD
was lower in women than men and was lower in minorities
than Whites. Minorities, especially African Americans and
Asians, started smoking a whole cigarette at a later age than
Whites, on average 1.5 years later. Hispanics and Asians
scored lower than Whites on the FTND (table 1). Compared
with males, females experienced fewer pleasant and more
unpleasant symptoms with their initial cigarette; African
Americans experienced fewer unpleasant symptoms than
Whites did.
Distributions of nicotine metabolite excretion data
The distribution of the absolute urine 3HC/COT ratio in
the sample is displayed in figure 1. Distributions of the
logged ratios by race/ethnicity are shown in figure 2.
There were strong gender and racial/ethnic differences in
average values of the 3HC/COT ratio. It was higher among
women than men, higher among Whites than African Amer-
icans, and lowest among Asians (table 2).
Correlates of the 3HC/COT ratio
There were significant gender and racial/ethnic associa-
tions with the ratio (table 3). In the total sample, when we
controlled for other covariates, there were two highly sig-
nificant predictors: gender, with females having a higher
ratio than males; and race/ethnicity, with African Americans
and Asians having a lower ratio than Whites. The same
racial/ethnic differences were observed among females,
whereas, among males, only Asians had a lower ratio than
Whites. Among females, higher age at onset of smoking
a whole cigarette was negatively associated with the ratio.
There were several racial/ethnic subgroup differences.
White and Hispanic females had higher ratios than males;
the reverse was observed among Asians. Higher education
was positively associated with the ratio among African
Americans. At the univariate level, unpleasant symptoms
occurring during the initial smoking experience were nega-
tively associated with the ratio among Hispanics, and pleas-
ant symptoms and dizziness were negatively associated
among Asians. After we controlled for other covariates, un-
pleasant symptoms were the only symptoms of initial sen-
sitivity that remained significant among Hispanics, as was
found for dizziness among Asians. With control for other
covariates, none of the other variables included in the

models--CPD, nicotine dependence (FTND), or body mass
index--had any unique association with the ratio in any
racial/ethnic group.
In their sample of heavy smokers, Benowitz et al. (24)
reported a significant association between CPD and the ra-
tio. To parallel this analysis among heavy smokers in this
sample, we identified those who met criteria for dependence
according to the FTND and those who did not, excluding the
CPD item. The association was null in both groups. Simi-
larly, no association was found between the ratio and CPD
in each of four quantities on the 3HC/COT ratio (data not
presented.)
The nicotine metabolite ratio, individual nicotine
dependence symptoms, and initial sensitivity
experiences
Although the total nicotine dependence FTND score was
unrelated to the nicotine metabolite ratio, we examined sep-
arately each FTND symptom in the total sample, by gender
and race/ethnicity, to investigate in greater detail potential
associations of the ratio with specific nicotine dependence
symptoms. We also examined associations with individual
initial sensitivity items. Testing of all scale items individu-
ally, particularly across subgroups, inflates type 1 error.
Very few significant associations emerged. CPD was sig-
nificant among females (r ¼ 0.12, p < 0.05), as observed in
the unadjusted odds from the regression models in table 3
based on an open-ended question about number of cigarettes
smoked in the last 30 days. Hating to give up the first cig-
arette of the day was negatively associated for Whites (r ¼
ÿ0.13, p < 0.05).
Two unpleasant symptoms associated with initial smok-
ing--coughing (r ¼ ÿ0.10, p < 05) and heart pounding (r ¼
ÿ0.12, p < 0.01)--were negatively associated with the ratio
among males. Unpleasant sensations were positively asso-
ciated among Whites (r ¼ 0.12, p < 0.05); nausea was
positively associated among African Americans (r ¼ 0.13,
p < 0.05); and coughing (r ¼ ÿ0.19, p < 0.01), difficulty
inhaling (r ¼ ÿ15, p < 0.05), and heart pounding (r ¼
ÿ0.14, p < 0.05) were negatively associated among His-
panics. Pleasurable rush (r ¼ ÿ28, p < 0.01) and dizziness
(r ¼ ÿ0.31, p < 0.001) were negatively associated among
Asians.
Urine metabolite concentrations and smoking behavior
The COT level in smokers is determined by daily nicotine
intake, the fraction of nicotine converted to COT, and the
rate of COT metabolism (37). Although not precise, COT
levels have been used to indicate daily nicotine intake.
Because 3HC is the major urinary metabolite of nicotine,
the sum of COTand 3HC may be a better measure than COT
alone of total daily nicotine intake. There was a significant
correlation between total FTND score and COT, 3HC, and
the sum of these two metabolites (table 4). The three mea-
sures were also highly correlated with number of cigarettes
smoked in the last 30 days and individual FTND items,
except hating to give up the first cigarette of the day, which
was uncorrelated with 3HC. Difficulty not smoking when

DISCUSSION
This paper presents novel data on the relation between
urine metabolites of nicotine and smoking behavior among
young adults in a nationally representative multiracial/
multiethnic sample. We examined these associations with
a noninvasive method for assessing nicotine clearance, the
nicotine metabolite ratio of 3HC (the major metabolite of
COT) over COT (the proximate metabolite of nicotine). The
3HC/COT ratio in plasma or saliva is highly correlated with
oral clearance of nicotine and is thought to be a marker of
CYP2A6 activity (9).
Our sample is of particular interest because young adults
are often in an early stage of developing nicotine addiction.
We focused on only daily smokers, for whom the urine
metabolite data were the most useful given the relative short
half-life of these metabolites. The average number of ciga-
rettes smoked was 12 per day, well below the national av-
erage of 16.8 per day (38). The average FTND score for our
subjects was 3.3, indicating a relatively low level of depen-
dence. Men smoked on average more cigarettes than women,
and Whites smoked considerably more than African Amer-
icans, Hispanics, or Asians. Racial/ethnic differences in
rates of smoking are consistent with those for young adults
in their twenties in the general population observed in other
national data sets (39, 40).
As indicators of daily intake of nicotine, we used urine
concentration of COT and the sum of COT and 3HC. In gen-
eral, the findings for COTand 3HC were similar. These mea-
sures were significantly associated with CPD, as expected,
and with sex, race/ethnicity, and education--reflecting dif-
ferences in cigarette smoking in these subgroups. The COT,
3HC, and COT þ 3HC measures were also significantly cor-
related with total FTND score and the individual items. The
strongest correlations were with time to smoking the first
cigarette after awakening and CPD. These findings are con-
sistent with those from many (but not all) prior studies that
have documented that extent of dependence on nicotine is
related to daily intake of nicotine (41).
As an indicator of nicotine intake per cigarette, we exam-
ined COT concentration normalized for number of ciga-
rettes smoked. This index of nicotine intake per cigarette
was considerably higher in African Americans compared
with other racial/ethnic groups. Similar findings have been
reported using plasma or saliva COT normalized for ciga-
rette smoking (41, 42).
As a phenotypic marker of the rate of nicotine metabolism,
we examined the distribution of the nicotine metabolite ratio in
the total sample and among racial/ethnic subgroups. Women
had higher 3HC/COT ratios on average than men; Whites and
Hispanics had higher ratios than African Americans or Asians,
consistent with findings from other studies using intravenous
infusion of nicotine to determine directly the rate of nicotine
metabolism (25, 41, 43) and a recent investigation based on the
ratio in a multiethnic sample of adolescents seeking treatment
for smoking cessation (44). At this time, we cannot explain the
observation that the metabolite ratios were greater for women
than men among Whites and Hispanics only. Of note is that the
rate of nicotine metabolism was slower in African Americans
and Asians than in Whites or Hispanics. Perhaps whatever
genetic differences explain slower metabolism in these racial

studies have found a gradient in the rate of nicotine metabo-
lism from men to premenopausal women to women using oral
contraceptives to pregnant women (43).
Nicotine metabolism is hypothesized to be a determinant
of smoking behavior. We found no significant relation be-
tween the 3HC/COT ratio and CPD. It is unclear why we did

genotypes of nicotine metabolism were used. Perhaps we
had very few very slow metabolizers, although this possi-
bility would be surprising given the substantial number of
Asians, among whom the prevalence of slow metabolizers is
higher, in our population. We speculated that the lack of
relation between the nicotine metabolite ratio and cigarette
use is associated with the relatively low level of smoking
(average CPD ¼ 12) among our subjects, who may not have
been as nicotine dependent or whose smoking may have
been more constrained by environmental restrictions com-
pared with older, heavier smokers studied by other investi-
gators. Our speculation was not supported by additional data
analysis. The association was still null within each of four
groups varying in the extensiveness of smoking. Our data
suggest that the rate of nicotine metabolism is not an im-
portant determinant of smoking behavior in young smokers.
Titration of nicotine intake with related changes in smoking
behavior due to individual variation in the rate of nicotine
metabolism appears to be more relevant to smokers in a more
mature stage of nicotine addiction.
Similarly, among our subjects, there was no relation be-
tween the nicotine metabolite ratio and level of dependence.
We also examined response to the first smoked cigarette of
the day because it might predict progression from experi-
mentation to addictive smoking. The rate of nicotine metab-
olism would be expected to influence how long nicotine
stays in the body and potentially the experience from smok-
ing the first cigarette. We found no association between the
ratio and the response to the first cigarette. We found sig-
nificant associations between the nicotine metabolite ratio
and some initial sensitivity responses by sex and race/
ethnicity: heart pounding in men, unpleasant symptoms in
Hispanics, and dizziness in Asians. In these subgroups, slow
metabolizers experienced more adverse symptoms from
their first cigarette. Why this finding was observed in some
subgroups but not others is not clear. As in all subgroup
analyses, replication in future studies is needed.
In summary, we have demonstrated the utility of using
urine nicotine metabolite measurements to study racial/
ethnic and sex differences in smokers and smoking behavior
among young adults. Our findings with respect to sex and
race/ethnicity differences in nicotine metabolite ratio gener-
ally replicate results regarding nicotine metabolism from
studies of older smokers that used more invasive laboratory
methods. The noninvasive urine metabolite ratio approach
can be used for large population studies in which more in-
vasive methods are unfeasible. Replication of findings
among young adult smokers is important to understanding
how smokers differ early in their smoking history, before
they have reached the maximal level of nicotine dependence.
A limitation of our study is that we considered only daily
smokers--that is, chronic smokers who had already devel-
oped some level of nicotine dependence. Further studies are
needed to determine how differences in nicotine metabolism
predict the transition from experimental smoking to addic-
tion and the ability of addicted smokers to quit. That the rate
of nicotine metabolism may influence these behaviors is
suggested by studies of the CYP2A6 genotype showing
differences in very slow metabolizers compared with
others, although the patterns may differ at different phases
of the life cycle. Since genetically defined very slow
metabolizers account for only a small percentage of all
smokers, measurement of a nicotine metabolism phenotype,
such as the nicotine metabolite ratio, is needed for popula-
tion studies.
