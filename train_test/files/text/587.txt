Abstract
Background
The extant literature on gender differentials in health in developed countries suggests that
women outlive men at all ages, but women report poorer health than men. It is well estab-
lished that Indian women live longer than men, but few studies have been conducted to
understand the gender dimension in self-rated health and self-reported disability. The pres-
ent study investigates gender differentials in self-rated health (SRH) and self-reported dis-
ability (SRD) among adults in India, using a nationally representative data.
Methods
Using data on 10,736 respondents aged 18 and older in the 2007 WHO Study on Global
Ageing and Adult Health in India, prevalence estimates of SRH are calculated separately
for men and women by socio-economic and demographic characteristics. The association
of SRH with gender is tested using a multinomial logistic regression method. SRD is
assessed using 20 activities of daily living (ADL). Further, gender differences in total life
expectancy (TLE), disability life expectancy (DLE) and the proportion of life spent with a dis-
ability at various adult ages are measured.
Results
The relative risk of reporting poor health by women was significantly higher than men (rela-
tive risk ratio: 1.660; 95% confidence Interval (CI): 1.430­1.927) after adjusting for socio-
economic and demographic characteristics. Women reported higher prevalence of severe
and extreme disability than men in 14 measures out of a total20 ADL measures. Women
aged less than 60 years reported two times more than men in SRD  5 ADLs. Finally, both
DLE and proportion of life spent with a disability were substantially higher for women irre-
spective of their ages.

Conclusion
Indian women live longer but report poorer health than men. A substantial gender differen-
tial is found in self-reported disability. This makes for an urgent call to health researchers
and policy makers for gender-sensitive programs.
Introduction
Recently, a growing body of research has looked at the gender gap in health and mortality, gen-
erally termed "the male-female health-survival paradox"[1­3]. A large body of literature con-
firms that women outlive men worldwide [4­6]. However, in Northern, Latin American and
Caribbean countries [7­10], and in a few South Asian countries [11­12], women are more
likely than men to report self-rated worse health and higher prevalence and incidence of dis-
ability and chronic morbidity.
Does this gender gap hold for India, where gender plays a crucial role from birth to death,
and from nutrition to health care service utilizations? The answer is of enormous policy rele-
vance. The literature addressing the gender gap in mortality in India is ample [13­16]. Unlike
in the developed world, Indian females do not enjoy survival advantages over males in every
age group. More recent studies find that the female infant mortality rate in many states of India
is higher than the male infant mortality rate [17]. India still has a high volume of excess female
deaths at infant and child age (1­4 years) due to discriminatory care at home, discriminatory
health-care seeking and selective termination of female fetuses [18]. Despite this, Indian
females enjoy a higher life expectancy at birth than males and the male-female gap in survivor-
ship favours adult and elderly females.
Despite this important role of gender in health and mortality, few studies address the gender
difference in self-rated health (SRH) [12,19­21] and in self-reported disability (SRD) in India
[22­24]; these debate the gender difference in SRH and SRD side by side and arrive at different
conclusions. While some studies [21,25] demonstrate that the gender differential in SRH per-
sists even after adjusting socio-economic variables, other studies show that the gender differen-
tial in self-assessed health turns in favour of women when adjusted for the role of socio-
economic factors [19]. It is found that women tend to report worse health than men, especially
among the socio-economically advantaged group [25], and socio-economic status contributes
significantly to this gap [19]. Studies on gender difference in SRD also reveal that, in general,
women report higher disability condition than men [22­23], but the gender difference in dis-
ability may not be significant in the context of South India [24].
Self-rated health (SRH) is a widely used measure based on a person's self-assessment of his/
her status in response to the question "In general, how would you rate your health today?" [26­
28]. Although SRH overlooks the concern of interpersonal incomparability; it is a remarkably
reliable measure that is consistent with the actual health status of the respondents [26,29]. Self-
rated health has been used to assess the health status of populations and predict health out-
come, survival, impending morbidity and death [26,29­31]. Self-reported disability, another
SRH measure, is extensively used to assess disability and is considered a reflection of true dis-
ability among the elderly population [32­33]. It is defined as functional limitations in activities
of daily living involving bathing, eating, a transfer from bed to chair, use of the toilet, etc. [33].
Numerous earlier studies demonstrated empirically that data on SRH and SRD is consistent
with both performed measures and medical diagnosis [32,34­35]. Earlier studies confirmed
that both men and women report their disability accurately, and the higher prevalence of

reported functional problems among women is perhaps a reflection of true disability for most
disability measures [32]. A five-year follow-up survey of the Study on Global Ageing and Adult
Health (SAGE) conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) multi-country study on
global ageing and adult health in rural India found that bad or very bad self-rated health was a
strong predictor of mortality for persons aged above 50, even after controlling for socio-demo-
graphic and disability measures [26].
The purpose of the present study is to examine the gender differential in SRH and SRD
among older adults in India. Our study extends the extant knowledge in several directions.
First, we combine the analysis of gender difference in SRH and SRD to present a coherent pic-
ture of the gender difference in health status among adults in India. Second, we investigate gen-
der difference in total life expectancy (TLE), disabled life expectancy (DLE) and disabled free
life expectancy (DFLE) to demonstrate the health disadvantage of women despite survival
advantage in adult age. Finally, unlike most of the previous studies on SRD in India, our study
is based on a nationally representative survey, indicating a generalization of results at national
level. The findings on gender inequality in adult health might prove useful for health planners
and policy makers, especially in countries subject to rapid health transition.
Data and Methods
2.1. Ethics statement
We used cross-sectional WHO SAGE survey data, approved by the Ethics Review Committee
of the WHO, Geneva and the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai (IIPS)
implementing the national SAGE survey. Before conducting the interviews, respondents partic-
ipating in this survey were given a "Respondent information Form", which detailed the giving
details of the survey purpose, methods and data collection procedure involved in this survey.
Finally, written informed consent was taken from the respondents of aged 21 and older. For
participants under 21 years old of age, a parent or guardian also signed in the consent form.
2.2. Data Description
We used data primarily from the SAGE, carried out by the IIPS in 2007­08 under the WHO
multi-country study on global ageing and adult health. The main objective of this study was to
obtain reliable, valid and comparable data on levels of health across a range of key domains for
adult populations aged 50-plus in nationally represented samples. The study aimed also to sup-
plement and cross-validate self-reported measures of health by anchoring a vignette approach
to improving the comparability of self-reported measures for selected health domains [36­37].
The first wave of the SAGE was implemented in six states selected to ensure a nationally
representative sample--Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West
Bengal. The same primary sampling units (PSUs) and households covered in the 2003 World
Health Survey (WHS) are comprised the baseline sample for SAGE Wave 1 India in 2007­08.
The SAGE Wave 1 India included a total sample of 12,198. Out of 12,198 interviews, 10,736
interviews were completed, 494 interviews were partially completed and the rest were either
refused or missed. Our analysis is based on 10,736 completed interviews, of which about 58.2
percent belong to the 50+ age group.
Through face-to-face interviews, information was collected on the physical characteristics
of the dwelling or household; a household roster, including the sex, age, marital status, educa-
tion, and care needs of each household member; cash and non-cash transfers into and out of
the household; household income and expenditure; work history and benefits; health and
health behaviours; chronic conditions; health care utilization; social networks; subjective well-
being and quality of life; and on the impact of caregiving. The health status of individuals was

also assessed with the help of the following biomarkers: anthropometry (weight, height, body
mass index, waist-to-hip ratio); physical tests (timed walk, hand grip strength, lung function,
vision tests, blood pressure); cognition tests (verbal fluency, immediate and delayed verbal
recall, digit span); and blood tests (from consenting respondents, to test for anaemia, diabetes,
and cardiovascular disease). A detailed description of this data can be found in the India
National Report of the SAGE [36].
2.3. Measures
Self-rated health was defined by the answer to the question "In general, how would you rate
your health today?" The options to answer this question were available on a five-point Likert
scale: very good, good, moderate, bad and very bad. In our analysis, we converted the responses
from a five-point scale to a three-point scale by combining very good and good to "good",
moderate to "moderate" and very bad and bad to "poor". Self-reported disability in 20 activities
of daily living (ADL, defined as having severe or extreme difficulties performing activities of
daily living) measures--addressing mobility, self-care, pain and discomfort, cognition, inter-
personal activities, sleep and energy, affect and vision were used to measure disability. For
example, the first question related to mobility is "Overall in last 30 days, how much difficulty
did you have with moving around?" The options to answer this question were available on a
five-point Likert scale: none, mild, moderate, severe and extreme or cannot do. If the answer
from the respondent "severe" or "extreme or cannot do" in moving around, it is defined as a
self-reported disability in moving around ADL. The details of the questions used to define self-
reported disability are given in S1 Appendix.
We analyzed gender differentials in self-rated health by a number of socio-economic and
demographic variables, including age, gender, education (primary school or less, secondary
school completed, tertiary or higher education); wealth quintiles of household, (Q1 lowest to
Q5 highest), religion (Hindu, Muslim and Others); ethnicity (Others, Scheduled Caste (SC)
and Scheduled Tribe (ST)); and marital status (currently married, never married and sepa-
rated/divorced/widowed).
2.4. Statistical Methods
To estimate the prevalence of SRH and SRD by gender, we used STATA S.E. 10.0 (STATA
Corp., Inc., College Station, TX). We performed chi-square test to assess whether there were
significant gender differences in the sample by socio-economic and demographic factors and
also in self-reported disabilities. To estimate DFLE and DLE, the Sullivan Method [38] was
applied. We used the proportion of disability by age and sex on Sample Registration System
(SRS)[39] life tables of India for the period 2006­2010. The SRS, a dual vital registration system
in India covering six million of population in India, provides the most reliable estimates of vital
rates at national and sub-national levels (state categorized by rural-urban) since the 1970s. A
detailed description of SRS data can be found elsewhere [40]. We used multinomial logistic
regression to assess the adjusted effect of gender on SRH. The outcome variable has three cate-
gories: self-reported good, moderate and poor health. We estimated the relative risk of (1) poor
health versus good health and (2) moderate health versus good health. Age was estimated as a
continuous independent variable. The gender, education and wealth quintiles of a household,
religion, ethnicity and marital status were considered as categorical independent variables. A
p-value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. The evidence for multicollinearity
was assessed by the multicollinearity diagnostic (variance inflation factor or VIF). All VIFs
were less than 2, indicating that the assumption of reasonable independence among predictor

variables was met. A total of 113 missing cases (1 case in age, 71 cases in wealth index and 41
cases in ethnicity) were excluded from the multinomial logistic regression analysis.
Results
3.1. Self-rated Health (SRH)
Table 1 presents gender differentials in self-rated health by socio-economic and demographic
characteristics. The figures presented in the table are the percentage of men and women report-
ing self-rated health, categorized into good, moderate and poor health. In general, 15.1% of
Indian women rated their health as "poor" compared to15.2% of Indian men. Most findings in
this table are in the expected direction. For example, as age increases, the percentage of people
reporting poor health increases (men: 3.8% to 38.4%; women: 4.7% to 44.6%); urbanites enjoy
better health than rural people (45.4% urban men report good health against37.7% rural men;
40.7% urban women report good health against 38.0% rural women); as education increases,
the percent of people reporting good health increases (Men: 28.4% to 56.9%; Women: 30.8% to
61.3%), as household wealth index increases from poorest to least poorest quintile, self-rated
health improves (Men:32.6% to 47.8%; Women:34.5% to 45.0%). Finally, people belonging to
deprived social groups like Muslims, STs and SCs reported poor self-rated health. Table 1 also
presents the p-value of chi-square test examining gender difference in socio-economic and
demographic variables. Except for a few predictors (wealth index, religion and ethnicity), p-val-
ues were always significant, indicating a clear existence of gender difference in the predictor
variables.
The most noticeable finding in Table 1 is the presence of clear gender differences in self-
rated health by socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Women from each age group
report systematically poorer self-rated health than men. Interestingly, as age increases, the gen-
der difference in self-rated health also increases. While a higher percentage of urban men than
urban women rate their health as "good", there is no difference in self-rated health between
rural men and women. Likewise, except those in the deprived categories (say, belonging to
rural, low educated, household with poor wealth quintile and scheduled tribes) all women
rated their health worse than men.
3.2. Self-rated disabilities in activities of daily living (ADL)
Table 2 reports the prevalence estimates of SRD in 20 ADL measures by gender in India for
2007­2008. The most striking finding is that out of twenty ADL measures addressing mobility,
self-care, pain/discomfort, cognition, interpersonal activities, sleep/ energy, affect and vision,
women reported systematically higher prevalence of severe and extreme disability than men in
fourteen measures. Among all these measures, the gender difference in self-rated disabilities is
more pronounced in three components: pain and discomfort, interpersonal relationship and
affects. The p-values of chi-square test examining gender difference in self-reported disabilities
again indicate a clear existence of gender difference in performance of activities of daily living.
Table 3 and Fig 1 further present prevalence estimates (in percentage) in at least one, three
and five self-reported disabilities by gender and age groups in India for 2007­2008. Table 3 and
Fig 1 clearly suggest that a higher proportion of women suffer from disabilities in ADL in all
adult age groups. However, the gender differential was the highest in the age group less than 50
and 50­59, with the percent of women reporting more than five disabilities being two times
more than their male counterparts (Male: 3.9% against 8.1% female in age group <50; Male:
8.7% against 20.0% female in age group 50­59) etc.

ability (DLE/TLE) by age and gender, calculated for at least one, three and five disabilities out

of twenty disabilities as shown in Table 2. After age20, women are expected to live longer than
men at each age. On average, women live two years longer than men, and the gender gap
(women versus men) reduces from 4.0 years at age 20 to 0.6 years at age 80. However, women
are also expected to live more years with disability, as DLE for women for any number of dis-
abilities is higher than DLE for men at each age. Interestingly, the gender disparity in DLE is
far more pronounced than the gender disparity in total life expectancy and varies greatly by
age. For example, the gender difference in DLE calculated for at least one self-disability is a

high as 9.8 years at age20; it drops to 5.2 years at age 50 and to 3.2 years at age 60. The DLE cal-
culated for at least one self-rated disability shows that both Indian men and women spend a
considerable proportion of their life with at least one disability; for example, at age 50, men and
women are expected to live 57.3% and 70.5% of their life with at least one type of disability
respectively. Once again, women spend a higher proportion of their life with poorer health
status.
The magnitude of DLE and percentage of life with disability reduced to almost half and
one-fourth when we calculated the same for at least three and five self-rated disability respec-
tively. Nevertheless, we observed similar kind of gender disparity in TLE, DFLE, DLE and per-
cent of life with a disability.
Table 5 presents the results of the multinomial logistic regression. The majority of the asso-
ciations found in Table 5 are consistent with the findings of Table 2. The relative risk ratio
(RRR) of having poor health versus good health increases as age increase (RRR: 1.90; CI: 1.81­

the separated or divorced (RRR:1.30; CI: 1.09­1.55). All these relationships are statistically sig-
nificant. Similar results are found in the RRRs of having moderate health versus good health, as
shown in Table 5. The most noticeable point in Table 5 is that females have significantly higher
relative risk than men of having poor health versus good health (RRR: 1.69; CI: 1.46­1.97), and
of having moderate health versus good health (RRR: 1.39; CI: 1.25­1.55). Thus, even after con-
trolling for relevant socio-economic variables, women are more likely than men to report poor
or moderate health.

Discussion and Conclusion
Our first objective was to contribute to the debate over the gender difference in SRH in India.
We found that, in general, Indian adult women report poorer health than Indian adult men.
This finding is consistent with the findings of studies conducted in other countries [41­ 43]
and in India [12,19,21,25, 44­46]. This study found that the gender difference in SRH persisted
even after adjusting the effect of the socio-economic condition. This is contrary to the findings
of a previous study [19]. The finding of this study, however, is consistent with the previous
findings [20­21] that health disadvantages among women could not be explained by the differ-
ence in demographics and socio-economic characteristics.
There are a few explanations why women live longer than men but have poorer health. Sev-
eral studies exhibit that this is due to biological, social and behavioral factors [47­50].
Researchers have suggested that two factors in particular contribute the excess mortality of
men. First, women are more likely than men to adopt preventative health behaviors, such as
routine annual visits to a physician for a check-up. Men are more likely to engage in risky
behaviours, such as excessive drinking, drunken driving, illegal drug use, physical fights and
violence and high tobacco consumption [48,51­55]. Early in life, boys are more susceptible to
death than girls due to biological reasons [56­57]. In adolescence, youth and adulthood, men
die from exposure to risks linked to their social and behavioural characteristics [48]. Studies
argued that poorer health among women is due to biological as well as behavioural factors.
Some studies discuss that while women suffer more than men, female ailments tend to be less
lethal biologically [7,58]. Some other studies refer to the over-reporting of worse health among
women [59­60]. In addition, women's longer life expectancy also influences male-female dif-
ferences in health status [3]. It is showed that larger the female excess in longevity, larger the
female excess in the proportion of life in poor health [3].
Our second objective was to extend the analysis to SRD and its connotation with life expec-
tancy at various stages of adulthood. All three measures of SRD (prevalence estimates of SRD
in more than one, three and five ADL measures, corresponding DLEs and proportion of life
spent with disability at various stages of life) revealed that Indian women are subject to higher

levels of disability irrespective of their age. Notably, the gender gap in disability is found to be
the highest in difficulty in more than five ADLs in the age groups before age 60 (women
reported two times more than men). Our findings are consistent with the common wisdom
that the gender difference in disability is substantial, especially in ADL measures [61­ 64].
Future research should focus more on the unmet need of personal care among disabled adults
whether gender plays an important role in caregiving to differential exists in proving care and
treatment.
In the past several decades, life expectancy has increased in India; there are now over 192
million people aged 50 or older [39]. As a consequence of the rapid ageing of the population,
the central theme of health research in India has expanded beyond longevity towards under-
standing the burden of disease and disability, particularly among adults. Longevity is greater
among females than males, especially at adult ages, in India--as in all other countries. Does the

survival advantage of females translate to their poorer health? Answering this question is of
enormous importance for future health care needs and policy. A few studies address the gender
differential in health and disability among older adults in India [20­21,24­25,65­68], but this
study extends the knowledge by examining SRH and SRD together. By using nationally repre-
sentative survey data, this study first investigated the role of gender in self-rated health among
adults in India after controlling for socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and
examined gender differential in SRD in performing twenty ADLs (severe and extremely diffi-
culty) and thereafter revealed the linkage between survival and SRD measured by TLE, DFLE,
DLE and percent of life spent with self-reported disability.
This study suggests that in India, as in other parts of the world, women bear the greater bur-
den of disability in their adult age. In the absence of governmental support, the problem might
be acute, especially among marginalized women living alone, widowed and poorly off socio-
economically. The findings of this study strongly suggest the need for a coherent and gender
sensitive health agenda for ageing populations in India. We also suggest future in-depth studies
focused on the complex gender dynamics in health and disability in India at a regional level.
Limitations
The present study has a few limitations. First, we could not throw light on the regional dimen-
sions of gender differentials in SRH and SRD because the sample size at the regional level is
inadequate. Previous studies have documented the regional divide in gender differentials in
health outcomes in India [44,69]. Neither could we test the relationship between female excess
longevity and female excess in the proportion of life in poor health using time trend data. Sec-
ond, we could not analyze the trend of gender differentials in DLE in India due to lack of such
data. In the absence of it, we again could not test whether increasing SRD by women is a func-
tion of increasing survivorship or that women naturally report poorer health even in the
absence of acute gender differential in survivorship.
