OBJECTIVE -- Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that older Mexican Americans
are at high risk for type 2 diabetes and its complications. Type 2 diabetes leads to a more rapid
decline in functional status among older Mexican Americans with diabetes. This study was
designed to examine the impact of diabetes on change in self-reported functional status over a
2-year period among older Mexican Americans with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We performed a longitudinal analysis with
repeated measurements of functional limitations in a cohort of Mexican Americans aged 60
years in the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA). Diabetes was diagnosed on the
basis of self-report of physician diagnosis, medication use, and fasting plasma glucose. Func-
tional status was measured by assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental
activities of daily living (IADL) at baseline and 1 and 2 years.
RESULTS -- Of 1,789 SALSA participants, 585 (33%) had diabetes at baseline. Diabetic
subjects reported 74% more limitations than nondiabetic subjects in ADL (summary score for
number of limitations, 0.99 vs. 0.57; P  0.002) and 50% more limitations in IADL (summary
score for number of limitations, 7.83 vs. 5.25; P  0.0001). The annual rate of increase in limita-
tions of ADL and IADL was 0.046 and 0.033 (log scale) on each scale among diabetic subjects
compared with 0.013 and 0.003 (log scale) among nondiabetic subjects (P  0.0005). Compli-
cations of diabetes were found to increase ADL and IADL limitations among diabetic subjects.
Longer duration of diabetes was also associated with an increase in ADL and IADL limitations.
CONCLUSIONS -- There was lower baseline functional status and a more rapid decline in
functional status among older Mexican Americans with diabetes versus those without diabetes.

The population of Mexican Ameri-
cans in the U.S. has increased dra-
matically over the past several
decades due to immigration, high birth
rates, and markedly reduced mortality
(i.e., early and middle age). There are now
an estimated 20 million Mexican Ameri-
cans in the U.S., of whom 2 million are
older than 60 years (1). Diabetes is a ma-
jor clinical and public health challenge
among Mexican Americans. Earlier epide-
miological studies have shown that older
Mexican Americans are among the high-
est-risk groups for diabetes, its complica-
tions (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy,
and peripheral vascular disease), and
other comorbidities (e.g., hypertension)
compared with non-Hispanic whites (2­
5). Five large-scale epidemiological stud-
ies focusing on Hispanic Americans
established that the prevalence of diabetes
was two to three times greater for Mexican
Americans than for non-Hispanic whites
(6­10).
Patients with diabetes are two to three
times more likely to report disability than
their nondiabetic counterparts (11). Dia-
betic subjects 65 years of age averaged
19.4 days of restricted activity compared
to only 8.2 days for nondiabetic subjects
(12). Diabetes as a chronic disease signif-
icantly limits daily activity in 60% of
diabetic people 65 years of age com-
pared with only 33.5% of those without
diabetes (12). Disability is associated with
an increased likelihood for hospitaliza-
tion, institutionalization, and loss of eco-
nomic self-sufficiency (13,14). Disabled
persons with diabetes utilized health care
services more frequently than nondis-
abled diabetic subjects (32.4% vs. 13.2%
hospitalized in the past year) (15).
The impact of diabetes on functional
limitations and disability has been ad-
dressed in some earlier studies (11,16­
19). For instance, Haan et al. (19) showed
that diabetic subjects 60 years and older,
especially Spanish-speaking Hispanics,
reported a greater number of limitations
for activities of daily living (ADL) and in-
strumental activities of daily living
(IADL). (ADL measures the activities for
personal care, and IADL measures the ac-
tivities related to household management
[20,21]).
Unfortunately, most of the studies ex-
amining the impact of diabetes on func-
tional limitations and disability were
based on cross-sectional designs and

could not capture declines in functional
status (11,16­19). Diagnosis of diabetes
in some previous studies of functional sta-
tus was ascertained using self-reporting
by the subjects (11). Underreporting of
diabetes might be present and might re-
sult in nondifferential misclassification
bias of diabetes status. In addition, some
of the earlier studies involved only small
numbers of subjects or substantial non-
participation rates (11,16,19). These lim-
itations may affect the generalizability of
these studies to other populations. Also,
evaluation of the effect of diabetes on
functional status in these studies did not
focus on some high-risk groups, such as
older Mexican Americans.
Older Mexican Americans generally
have a higher prevalence of diabetes, its
complications, and related comorbid
conditions and worse glycemic control
than non-Hispanic whites (2­10). Older
Mexican Americans with diabetes might
have significant decline in functional sta-
tus compared with nondiabetic subjects.
This in turn might lead to disability, di-
minished quality of life, and an increase in
the economic burden for these individu-
als and society at large. In this article, we
examine the association of diabetes with
decline in ADL and IADL in a population-
based sample of older Mexican
Americans.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study population and recruitment
Participants in the Sacramento Area
Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) were used
in this research. The SALSA participants
were recruited from the Sacramento Met-
ropolitan area and four surrounding rural
counties in California in 1998­1999. An
eligible person was 60 years or older in
1998 and self-designated as Latino/-a.
The sampling frame in SALSA in-
volved identifying 1990 census tracts in
all areas, updating population estimates
from 1998 census sources, and character-
izing them by the percentage of eligible
residents (aged 60, Latino/-a). These
tracts were ranked in order of percent el-
igible, and all tracts in which the percent
eligible was at least 5% were selected for
the target population. Participants were
contacted in three stages: by mail, by
phone, and finally, by door-to-door
neighborhood enumeration. Up to 10 at-
tempts to contact the participants by tele-
phone were allowed and up to five
attempts at the household. A separate re-
port contains a detailed description of the
sampling frame and recruitment (22).
Data collection
Baseline data collection began in 1998
and was completed in 1999. The first and
second follow-up visits were completed
in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
SALSA participants were interviewed in
the language of choice at baseline and an-
nually. All data collection, except for neu-
roimaging, was done at the participants'
homes. In a 2-h interview, each partici-
pant answered questions about lifestyle
factors, acculturation, and medical diag-
nosis. A proxy interview was done with
caregivers of participants who were
deemed too impaired cognitively or oth-
erwise to respond accurately to interview
questions. In total, 5% of the participants
died, 4% were lost to follow-up, and 11%
refused further follow-up at the end of
year 2. This study analyzed change in
functional status from baseline over the 2
years of follow-up.
Measurement
Diabetes
Diagnosis of diabetes was ascertained us-
ing a combination of medical history,
drug use, and fasting blood glucose. Data
were collected during interview and
blood sample protocol at baseline and at
every annual visit. Participants who met
any of the following criteria at baseline or
follow-up were characterized as having
diabetes:
 Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level
126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) (fasting was
defined as no caloric intake for at least
8 h).
 Use of an antidiabetic medication.
 Self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of di-
abetes.
Duration of diabetes was ascertained by
self-report ("How long have you had this
condition?"). Diabetic complications in-
cluded self-reported retinopathy and re-
nal disease. Amputation was assessed by
observation during the interview.
Functional status
This study focused on self-reported func-
tional status in personal care (basic ADL)
and household management (IADL)
(20,21). ADL comprises seven items to
measure the abilities to walk across a
small room, brush hair or teeth, eat, use
the toilet, transfer, dress, and bathe (20).
IADL comprises 15 items to measure the
ability for household management such
as prepare meals, do housework, manage
money, and use the telephone (21).
Other variables
Diagnosis of hypertension was ascer-
tained using a combination of medical
history and measured blood pressure.
Participants who met either of the follow-
ing criteria were characterized as having
hypertension:
 systolic pressure 140 mmHg and/or
diastolic pressure 90 mmHg; and
 self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of hy-
pertension or high blood pressure.
Stroke was determined by self-report
("Has a doctor ever told you that you had
a stroke?" followed by "How many
months or years ago was this?" and "Were
you hospitalized for this?"). Stroke in a
subsample (n  150) of self-reported
stroke was validated by medical chart
review.
Depressive symptoms were mea-
sured with the Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression (CES-D) scale (23).
Acculturation was measured by the Ac-
culturation Rating Scale for Mexican
Americans (ARSMA-II) (24). Weight,
height, and waist and hip circumference
were measured using standardized in-
struments. BMI was calculated as mea-
sured weight in kilograms divided by
measured height in meters squared. Edu-
cation, medical insurance, household in-
come, smoking status, and alcohol use as
well as physical activities were assessed in
home visit.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was performed using
PC-SAS (version 8.1). Baseline analysis
was carried out using 2, linear regres-
sion, or logistic regression. A longitudinal
analysis based on the measurements at
three time points was performed using a
generalized estimating equation (GEE). A
0.05 level of significance was used for all
the analyses.
For baseline linear regression analy-
sis, a summary score was created as a con-
tinuous variable for ADL and IADL
(range, 7­28 and 15­60, respectively).
Each summary score for ADL and IADL
was log-transformed to achieve normality
for longitudinal analysis. In addition, a bi-

DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 26, NUMBER 2, FEBRUARY 2003 315
nary response variable (0 and 1) was cre-
ated for logistic regression analysis. The
response probability for the binary ADL
variable was defined as probability of re-
porting difficulty in at least one of seven
ADL items. The response probability for
the binary IADL variable was defined as
probability of reporting difficulty in at
least 3 of 15 IADL items. A high threshold
for IADL was used, because a high per-
centage of subjects were reporting diffi-
culties in IADL (82.3% diabetic, 71.9%
nondiabetic).
Diagnosis of diabetes was coded as a
dichotomous independent variable (0
and 1). The effect of diabetes on 2-year
change in ADL and IADL for each subject
was specified by including the variable
time in years from baseline through the
second follow-up in the model (0, base-
line; 1, year 1; and 2, year 2). An interac-
tion term between diabetes and time was
used to test the hypothesis that functional
status change varied by diabetes status (a
simple linear model was assumed).
GEE requires missing data com-
pletely at random. Thus, to evaluate the
missing data mechanism, the participants
were stratified into three groups (re-
sponded, died, and did not respond), and
the outcome variables (e.g., ADL and
IADL) at baseline were compared in these
three groups. The results suggested that
the missing data mechanism was not
completely at random (reporting diffi-
culty performing at least one item for
ADL: responded, 12%; did not respond,
15%; died, 45%; at least three items for
IADL: responded, 41%; did not respond,
50%; died, 68%).
Multiple imputation (using proc mi
and proc mianalyze in SAS) was used to
impute missing data in conjunction with
the GEE method (25­27). The imputa-
tion model, which included the demo-
graphic variables, socioeconomic status,
CES-D score, medical history, and out-
comes of interest, was essentially the same
as the analysis model. Any missing data
for the summary score of ADL and IADL
as well as associated covariates were im-
puted. Five imputed datasets were used in
the analysis. The nonrespondents (refus-
al, dropped, and lost to follow-up) were
included in the imputation, because their
baseline values (ADL and IADL) were a
good estimate of follow-up values.
Confounding factors were evaluated,
depending on their influence on the main
effect terms or from the literature. Effect
modification by hypertension (stroke or
age) for the association between diabetes
and change in functional status over time
was assessed by including in the model
the three-way interaction term, e.g., dia-
betes  time  hypertension.
In the subgroup analysis, only dia-
betic subjects (n  585) were included,
and measurements at three time points
were analyzed to examine the association
of diabetic complications (or duration of
diabetes) with functional limitations. The
model included time and other covari-
ables. The effect of diabetic complications
(or duration of diabetes) on change in
functional status over time was not as-
sessed. Diabetic complication was coded
as a dichotomous independent variable (0
and 1). Duration of diabetes was coded as
a dummy variable (10, 11­20, 21­30,
30 years: 0, 1, 2, 3).
RESULTS
Prevalence of diabetes
Of 1,788 households initially contacted,
1,350 households were eligible and
agreed to participate. Of 1,789 study par-
ticipants, 585 were identified as having
diabetes at baseline (32.7%). Among
those with diabetes, 218 (37%) met the
three diagnostic criteria: 207 (35%) by
self-report plus FPG 126 mg/dl or self-
report plus medication use; 10 (2%) by
FPG plus medication; 67 (12%) by either
FPG or medication; and only 83 (14%) by
self-report alone. Of diabetic patients,
56% were women and 44.1% were men.
Men had a slightly higher prevalence of
diabetes than women (men 34.5% vs.
women 31.4%). The prevalence of diabe-
tes was similar in the age subgroups.
The mean duration of diabetes was
12.5 years (median 10 years, range 1
month to 61 years); 341 diabetic subjects
(58.3%) used either oral antidiabetic
drugs or insulin. Sulfonylureas were the
most common class of diabetic drugs, and
73% of the diabetic drug users (249 sub-
jects) used either a single sulfonylurea
drug or the combination of a sulfonylurea
drug with other medications. Glyburide
was the most common agent used of the
sulfonylurea drugs (20.5%).
Baseline characteristics
Diabetic subjects did not differ by age (di-
abetic vs. nondiabetic, 70.3  0.3 vs.
70.8  0.2 years; P  0.16), sex (diabetic
vs. nondiabetic, 55.9% female vs. 59.3%
female; P  0.17), or education level (di-
abetic vs. nondiabetic, 7.04  0.22 vs.
7.32  0.15 years; P  0.31). Diabetic
subjects were slightly more likely to have
medical insurance (diabetic vs. nondia-
betic, 92.9% vs. 89.7%; P  0.03). Dia-
betic subjects had lower household
incomes (diabetic vs. nondiabetic, 45.6%
vs. 44.5% $1,000 per month; P 
0.47). There was no difference in accul-
turation scores (diabetics vs. nondiabetic,
17.5 vs. 17.9; P  0.14). Diabetic subjects
had higher BMI, waist-to-hip ratios, and
CES-D scores than nondiabetic subjects
(diabetic vs. nondiabetic, BMI 30.9  0.5
vs. 29.0  0.5, P  0.0001; waist-to-hip
ratio 0.92  0.004 vs. 0.90  0.003, P 
0.0001; CES-D 10.9  0.5 vs. 9.6  0.3,
P  0.01).
There was no significant difference in
self-reported physical activity between di-
abetic and nondiabetic subjects. A slightly
higher percentage of diabetic subjects
were former smokers, but this was not
statistically significant. Diabetic subjects
were more likely to report a history of
hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 1.96, 95%
CI 1.58­2.43), stroke (2.46, 1.78­3.39),
heart attack (2.46, 1.76­3.43), kidney
disease (2.29, 1.63­3.21), diabetic reti-
nopathy (7.6% in diabetic group), and
amputation (2.81, 1.12­7.02).
Functional status: baseline analysis
Figure 1 shows the baseline ADL and
IADL scores by age and diabetes status.
ADL and IADL limitations increased with
age. Diabetic subjects had higher ADL
and IADL scores than nondiabetic sub-
jects across age-groups. Female subjects
had higher ADL and IADL scores than
male subjects (summary score for number
of ADL limitations: diabetic women,
1.15  0.16; diabetic men, 0.78  0.14;
nondiabetic women, 0.67  0.11; nondi-
abetic men, 0.43  0.10; summary score
for number of IADL limitations: diabetic
women, 9.22  0.43; diabetic men,
6.05  0.42; nondiabetic women, 6.05 
0.29; nondiabetic men, 4.09  0.30).
Overall, diabetic subjects reported 74%
more limitations than nondiabetic sub-
jects in ADL (summary score for number
of limitations 0.99 vs. 0.57; P  0.002)
and 50% more limitations in IADL (sum-
mary score for number of limitations 7.83
vs. 5.25; P  0.0001).
The logistic regression analysis using
ADL or IADL as a dichotomous variable
showed that diabetic subjects were almost

twice as likely to report difficulty in at
least one ADL item (or at least three IADL
items) compared with nondiabetic sub-
jects, when controlled for age, sex, BMI,
waist-to-hip ratio, household income,
CES-D score, hypertension, and history of
stroke (ADL, OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.54­
2.36; IADL, 1.74, 1.51­2.01).
Functional status: longitudinal
analysis
Table 1 presents multivariate regression
analysis using the GEE method based on
the five complete datasets from multiple
imputation. The rate of increase in ADL
and IADL scores among nondiabetic sub-
jects was very small or not significant
(ADL, OR 0.013, 95% CI 0.001­0.024;
IADL, 0.003, 0.010­0.016). However,
there was a significant increase in ADL
and IADL scores among diabetic subjects
(ADL, 0.046, 0.029­0.063; IADL, 0.033,
0.010­0.056). Effect modification of hy-
pertension (stroke or age) was assessed by
including in the model a three-way inter-
action term, e.g., diabetes  time  hy-
pertension. The results indicated that
hypertension, stroke, and age were not
significant effect modifiers on the associ-
ation of diabetes with the decline in ADL
and IADL. Therefore, these terms were
not reported (hypertension  diabetes 
year: ADL, P  0.45; IADL, P  0.35;
stroke  diabetes  year: ADL, P  0.59;
IADL, P  0.42; age  diabetes  year:
ADL, P  0.11; IADL, P  0.08).
Diabetes-related factors: analysis
using longitudinal data
Diabetic subjects with diabetic complica-
tions were more likely to be impaired in
ADL and IADL than those without com-
plications. For instance, diabetic subjects
with amputation were 1.6 times more
likely to report ADL limitations than dia-
betic subjects without amputation, when
adjusted for age, sex, household income,
BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, CES-D score, and
duration of diabetes. Diabetic subjects
with amputation had the most substantial
compromise of functional status (ampu-
tation: ADL, OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.35­1.83;
IADL, 1.43, 1.23­1.67; nephropathy:
ADL, 1.10, 1.02­1.17; IADL, 1.09, 1.04­
1.15; retinopathy: ADL, 1.05, 1.01­1.12;
IADL, 1.08, 1.02­1.15; all models were
adjusted for the same confounders stated
above).
In addition, diabetic subjects with a
longer duration of diabetes were more
likely to report functional limitations than
those with a shorter duration of the dis-
ease. For instance, diabetic subjects with
diabetes duration of 30 years were 1.10
times more likely to report IADL limita-
tions than those with duration 10 years,
when controlled for age, sex, household
income, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, CES-D
score, and a number of diabetes-related
complications (11­20 years: IADL, OR
1.03, 95% CI 0.98­1.07; 21­30 years:

CONCLUSIONS -- We found that
the prevalence of diabetes among Mexi-
can Americans aged 60 and above was
32.7% (men 34.5%, women 31.4%),
which is close to the prevalence found
among Mexican Americans with the same
age range in the Starr County (Texas)
Study (men 31.6%, women 25.8%) (6).
The prevalence of diabetes is also similar
to that estimated in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) conducted in 1988­1994
for Mexican Americans (10). We found
that older Mexican Americans with diabe-
tes had a higher risk for hypertension,
stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney dis-
ease, and amputation. Presence of diabe-
tes and associated complications may lead
to a significant decline in functional status
among these patients.
The prevalence of functional limita-
tions among diabetic subjects was found
to be nearly two times higher than that
among nondiabetic subjects in our study.
Our results are comparable with other
studies conducted among various ethnic
groups, although the criteria used to de-
fine functional limitations are slightly dif-
ferent across studies. For instance, in the
1982­1984 NHANES, activity limitations
(as measured by job performance, ability
to perform housework, and ADL) were
nearly two times more common in Mexi-
can Americans with diabetes than in those
without diabetes (28). In a study by
Tucker et al. (11), it was found that dia-
betes was more often associated with dis-
ability (as measured in 12-item ADL and
6-item IADL) among Puerto Ricans aged
55 years. In another study of inner-city
blacks, those with diabetes aged 70 years
and older had higher scores in four assess-
ments related to functional status (as mea-
sured by general health, IADL, modified
versions of the Rosow-Breslau scale, and
the Sanford Health Assessment Question-
naire) than nondiabetic control subjects
(18). In a study among older (age 65
years) French people living in the com-
munity, diabetic subjects more often
lacked autonomy according to the Katz
ADL Scale and the Lawton IADL Scale
(16,29).
We found similar patterns of func-
tional limitations between and within sex
subgroups as reported in a previous study
of Spanish-speaking Hispanic subjects
aged 60 years (19). Women reported
more limitations than men, and limita-
tions also increased with age in both dia-
betic and nondiabetic subjects.
The current study provides the first
longitudinal analysis with repeated mea-
surements to examine the effect of diabe-
tes on the decline in functional status
among older Mexican Americans. Our re-
sults support the hypothesis that older
Mexican Americans with diabetes had a
significantly higher decline rate in their
functional status than their nondiabetic
counterparts. There is another 2-year co-
hort study in older Mexican Americans
(30). Although their scope and study de-
sign were slightly different from ours, our
data also showed that the higher CES-D
score was associated with higher ADL and
ADL scores (P  0.0001).
Our results also indicated that both
diabetes-related complications and a
longer duration of diabetes contribute to
the increase in functional decline among
these subjects. Our results are consistent
with the finding from the 1989 National
Health Interview Survey, in which dia-
betic subjects with complications were
more likely to be impaired in their normal
activities than those without the chronic
complications of diabetes. In addition,
66­81% of type 2 diabetic subjects with
amputation, sensory neuropathy, kidney
disease or proteinuria, angina or any heart
trouble, or retinopathy reported limita-
tion in activities (15).
Furthermore, the current research
supports the causal relationship of diabe-
tes with functional impairment. This
study using a prospective cohort study
design confirmed the time relationship
that exposure (diabetes) precedes out-
come (decline in ADL and IADL) in time.
Diabetic subjects with worse glycemic
control are more likely to develop com-
plications, leading to functional impair-
ments. The results suggest that duration
of diabetes is related to diminished func-
tional status in a dose-response manner
when controlled for age, sex, household
income, BMI, and diabetes-related com-
plications. Diabetic patients with a longer
duration of the disease were more likely to
report functional limitations than those
with a shorter duration. Finally, results
obtained from the current research were
in line with prior studies conducted in
different populations and settings that
diabetic subjects had more functional
limitations than nondiabetic subjects
(11,16,19).
The findings of this research have im-
portant implications for the Mexican
American society. The limitations in ADL
and IADL, which are commonly used to
assess disability in basic life activities
among the population 65 years of age,
can be observed as evidence of disability.
Disability is a major social, economic, and
public health issue. Disability is associ-
ated with a greater increase in physician
visits, utilization of health care services,
hospitalization, institutionalization, de-
pendency in basic life activities, and loss
of economic self-sufficiency (13,14).
These circumstances greatly diminish the
quality of life of those affected as well as
increase the economic burden for individ-
uals and society.
Attenuation of diabetes progression
into chronic complications could result in
reduced economic, social, and public
health burden for individuals and society.
Promoting proper patient education/
awareness, increasing access to regular
medical care, and providing good quality
of care might help to circumvent some of
the problems, especially in communities
with lower socioeconomic status. In addi-
tion, functional status perhaps should be
considered a potential long-term out-
come of diabetes when clinicians are car-
ing for their older adult patients with
diabetes.
This study has several strengths. First,
a population-based sample of older Mex-
ican Americans was used, which could re-
sult in generalizability to other older
Mexican-American communities in other
geographic localities in the U.S. Second,
unlike most of the previous studies,
which have substantial underreporting
rates using self-reported physician-
diagnosed diabetes, the current study
used three diagnostic criteria to decrease
the underreporting rate. Third, a repeat-
ed-measure design provides more precise
estimates for the outcomes of interest
than previous cross-sectional studies.
Fourth, a longitudinal study is the best
design to assess functional status change
over time with regard to diabetes status
and allow for establishing relative tempo-
rality of exposure and outcome.
