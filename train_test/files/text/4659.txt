Introduction
As a consequence of economic crises, increasing unemploy-
ment rates, and the growing flexibility of labor markets, many
employees see a threat to their employment, which provides
them with income, social networks, privileges, and status
(Castel, 1994; Hobfoll, 1989; Sverke, Hellgren, & Näswall,
2002), and feel powerless about their employment situation
(Greenhalgh & Rosenblatt, 1984). Hence, they experience a
lack of controllability and predictability leading to a high bur-
den as they are in the dark about their future (De Witte, 2005).
The sources of job insecurity are multiple (Greenhalgh &
Rosenblatt, 1984), and at the outset there are often objective
triggers such as mergers, downsizings, or the implementation
of new technologies (Ashford, Lee, & Bobko, 1989). Yet job
insecurity also comprises a subjective dimension that is based
on the employee's interpretation of the situation. Some cir-
cumstances may be unstable, but an employee can still feel
secure. Vice versa, the circumstances may be stable according
to some objective criteria but the employee feels insecure as a
result of his/her interpretation of the situation (De Witte,
2005). It is common to distinguish between cognitive and
affective job insecurity. The former concerns the perception
of the risk of losing one's job (Huang, Lee, Ashford, Chen, &
Ren, 2010). The latter refers to the emotional reaction to the
perceived risk such as being worried or anxious (Pienaar, De
Witte, Hellgren, & Sverke, 2013). Although high affective
job insecurity often is a consequence of high cognitive job
insecurity (Huang et al., 2010), some employees are only
little worried because they perceive good labor market pros-
pects (Chung & van Oorschot, 2011). Therefore, some
scholars use the concept of employment insecurity: Even
though an employee may perceive high job insecurity (i.e.,
a high risk of losing the current job), he or she may be con-
fident to remain in paid work but with another job and/or
employer (Chung & van Oorschot, 2011; Dixon, Fullerton,
& Robertson, 2013; Green, 2011). In this case, the employee
perceives a low level of employment insecurity despite high
perceived job insecurity.

Reducing Employment Insecurity:
Further Training and the Role of the
Family Context
Florence Lebert1 and Erika Antal1
Abstract
The perception of job insecurity is known to be a stressful condition for employees. Less is known about employment
insecurity and the ways employees and their families deal with it. This study investigates whether participation in further
training is a strategy that employees adopt to reduce perceived employment insecurity. As participation in further training is
often costly and time-consuming, we assume that the family context is of importance for the decision to take part in further
training. To take account of possible self-selection, we apply a propensity score matching procedure on longitudinal data
from the Swiss Household Panel (2004-2013). Three main findings can be emphasized: first, participation in further training
is not a strategy adopted particularly by employees who perceive high employment insecurity as they are less likely to train
than their secure counterparts. Second, even though further training is not a strategy that is actively adopted, employees
who train subsequently report lower levels of perceived employment insecurity. Third, the family context indeed influences
the likelihood to train: partnered employees are more likely to train and preschool-aged children act as a constraint on
women's but enhance men's participation in further training. Yet, in the context of high perceived employment insecurity,
children generally reduce their parents' likelihood to train as the parents may turn to other strategies that reduce perceived
employment insecurity.

Throughout this study we refer to the subjective dimen-
sion of insecurity unless otherwise indicated. When using the
term of perceived job insecurity, we mean the perceived risk
of losing the current job. In contrast we use the term of
employment insecurity when referring to employees who
perceive a high risk of becoming unemployed which means
that they not only perceive a threat to their current job but
also lack confidence to find other (equivalent) employment.
Research on job and employment insecurity has shown
that the insecurity reduces physical and mental well-being
(Sverke et al., 2002; Virtanen, Vahtera, Kivimäki, Pentti, &
Ferrie, 2002). For job insecurity it has also been demon-
strated that it influences work attitudes and performance
(Staufenbiel & König, 2010; Sverke et al., 2002). Although
some strands of research have considered coping strategies
in psychological terms such as cognitive reappraisal or self-
blame (e.g., Jordan, Ashkanasy, & Hartel, 2002; Mantler,
Matejicek, Matheson, & Anisman, 2005), little attention has
been paid to the practical actions that individuals may take to
reduce insecurity (Cheng, Mauno, & Lee, 2014; Kalleberg,
2009). We aim to fill this gap by examining one strategy that
employees may adopt: participation in further training. We
assume that through investment in one's human capital job
and employment, insecurity can be reduced. On the one
hand, further training helps keeping one's skills up to date
and therefore protects from dismissal (Lang, 2012). Hence,
further training is supposed to reduce perceived job insecu-
rity. On the other hand, it also helps in the case of job loss as
it may increase the individual's employability and avoid
experiencing unemployment (Smith, 2010). Thus, we assume
that participation in further training also decreases perceived
employment insecurity. In the present study, we approach
further training as training and learning activities that take
place on or off the job (Fleischhauer, 2007) but do not lead to
an officially recognized diploma (Swiss Federal Statistical
Office [FSO], 2010). These activities (e.g., IT, management,
or language courses [FSO, 2010]) can be supported by the
employer (financially, time-based, or by allowing flexibility)
or born entirely by the employee (FSO, 2014).
Previous research has shown that participation in further
training is highly selective and widely depends on individual
and work-related factors (see, for example, Albert, García-
Serrano, & Hernanz, 2010; Kyndt & Baert, 2013). Although
less explored, also family-related factors such as the pres-
ence of a partner, children, or economic hardship can be
assumed to influence the individual's probability to train
(Chan & Auster, 2003; Sussman, 2002): further training can
be expensive and time-consuming and therefore less attrac-
tive to some employees because of their family responsibili-
ties. The present study takes this selectivity into account by
considering the family context and applying a propensity
score matching (PSM) procedure. We answer three ques-
tions: First, do employees who perceive high employment
insecurity increase their participation in further training?
Second, does the family context (i.e., the presence of a
partner, preschool-aged children, and economic hardship)
influence the employee's likelihood to train, and third, does
participation in further training lead to a subsequent decrease
in perceived employment insecurity?
State of the Research
The Influence of Further Training on Perceived
Job Insecurity and Unemployment
A few studies have investigated whether participation in fur-
ther training decreases job insecurity. Further training is
expected to increase the employee's human capital and there-
fore his/her employability which subsequently reduces feel-
ings of job insecurity (Kohlrausch & Rasner, 2014; Lang,
2012). In a cross-sectional study of Bassanini (2006), further
training was indeed related to lower levels of perceived job
insecurity. In contrast, Elman and O'Rand (2002) did not
find such an effect. However, in longitudinal studies, further
training was identified as reducing perceived job insecurity
(Dieckhoff, 2007; Kohlrausch & Rasner, 2014; Lang, 2012).
In a study from Germany, older employees benefited most
from further training to decrease their perceived job insecu-
rity (Lang, 2012). However, the effect was only found for
employees who irregularly participated in further training
and employees who indicated that they participated in fur-
ther training to adjust their skills to new demands in the cur-
rent job (Lang, 2012). In general, older as well as low-skilled
employees seem to benefit most from further training
(Bassanini, 2006; Kohlrausch & Rasner, 2014), and there is
not only a short-term but also a long-term effect from further
training in reducing perceived job insecurity (Kohlrausch &
Rasner, 2014).
Concerning unemployment, Dieckhoff (2007) showed
that further training reduced the risk of unemployment and
increased the probability of exiting from unemployment in
Germany. In Switzerland, further training is one measure of
its active labor market policy. However, it had a modest
impact on pushing individuals out of unemployment (Gerfin
& Lechner, 2002; Lalive, Van Ours, & Zweimüller, 2008).
Most of the studies that evaluated the impact of further
training focused on objective states such as unemployment
(e.g., Dieckhoff, 2007; Lalive et al., 2008) or on perceived
job (in)security (e.g., Kohlrausch & Rasner, 2014; Lang,
2012). Hardly anything is known about the effect of further
training on perceived employment insecurity (Chung & van
Oorschot, 2011).
Empirical Evidence for Determinants of
Participation in Further Training
As it will become apparent in this section, participation in
further training is not randomly distributed in the population
but highly selective. Individual, work-, and family-related
factors influence an individual's likelihood to train.
Lebert and Antal 3
Concerning the influence of perceived job and employ-
ment insecurity on participation in further training, only little
evidence is available. Whereas some studies did not find an
association between perceived job insecurity and the proba-
bility to train (Blau et al., 2008; Cavanaugh & Noe, 1999),
Lang (2012) found reduced and Elman and O'Rand (2002)
increased participation of employees perceiving high job
insecurity. Furthermore, employees with a fixed-term con-
tract were less likely to participate compared with permanent
employees (Arulampalam, Booth, & Bryan, 2004; Kyndt &
Baert, 2013). Presumably, those with a fixed-term contract
got less support from their employers as the payback period
was limited in time (Forrier & Sels, 2003; Hansson, 2008).
Supervisors were more likely to participate than operators
(FSO, 2014; Green, 1993; Harris, 1999) as higher status jobs
require more skills: not only did supervisors need sound
expertise, but they also had to acquire leader skills (Green,
1993). Concerning employees who recently joined an orga-
nization, one would expect that they had higher probabilities
to train as they may have to acquire new skills to accomplish
their new tasks (Green, 1993). However, mixed findings
were reported, with some indicating lower probabilities for
employees with low tenure, while others finding higher
probabilities or no significant results (Albert et al., 2010;
Garavan, Carbery, O'Malley, & O'Donnell, 2010; Green,
1993; Kyndt & Baert, 2013). Conflicting results are also
reported for workload. Arulampalam et al. (2004) did not
find lower probabilities for part-time workers in a series of
European countries. However, Swiss (FSO, 2014) and Dutch
(Nelen & de Grip, 2009) data showed that employees with
higher workload were also more likely to participate in fur-
ther training. The higher the involvement in paid work, the
higher the payback time and the more profitable the training
(Leuven & Oosterbeek, 1999). In addition, employees work-
ing for companies that were undergoing downsizing or merg-
ers were more likely to participate in further training (Carbery
& Garavan, 2005; Xiao & Tsang, 2004). On the one hand, in
case of such restructuring processes, insecurity is high so
employees engage in strategies to increase their employabil-
ity (Cavanaugh & Noe, 1999). On the other hand, in the pro-
cess of restructuring, employees may take over new tasks
and responsibilities that they need to be trained for (Parker,
Chmiel, & Wall, 1997). Findings also indicated that further
training was more likely in large firms (FSO, 2014; Knoke &
Kalleberg, 1994). In comparison with small firms, they tend
to take a greater risk to train employees who have a lower
probability of recouping investment outlays (Harris, 1999).
Large companies also have a wider time horizon and a larger
internal market with better chances to benefit from training
investments, and they have more possibilities to internally
organize further training (Harris, 1999). Participation in fur-
ther training was also more likely in the public sector
(Arulampalam et al., 2004; FSO, 2014). While public organi-
zations do not have the primary aim of profit-maximization,
private organizations widely do. Fearing poaching, private
organizations may refrain more from investing in the further
training of their employees (Green, 1993). Employees work-
ing in occupations with continuing advancement (e.g., infor-
mation technology or media) have a high risk of skill
obsolescence (Smith, 2010). Therefore, these employees are
constantly urged to train to keep up with technological
changes. Employees in occupations in the banking and insur-
ance sector or in health and social care were also identified as
having higher probabilities to train (FSO, 2010, 2014; Kyndt
& Baert, 2013).
Along with these work-related factors, business cycles
presumably also influence individuals' behavior on the labor
market. When unemployment rates are high, competition for
jobs increases (Dieckhoff, 2007). To stay competitive,
employees need to develop and keep their skills up to date.
However, to our knowledge nothing is known about the
influence of unemployment rates on the likelihood to train.
The literature has also documented the influence of indi-
vidual factors on the employees' likelihood to train.
According to the human capital approach, women are less
likely to participate in further training as they have more dis-
ruptive careers and higher turnover rates which reduce the
payback period and make further training less attractive to
both the women and employers (Simpson & Stroh, 2002).
However, empirical results about gender differences in par-
ticipation rates were mixed (Kyndt & Baert, 2013). Whereas
for instance Lang (2012) did not find a difference between
men and women, Elman and O'Rand (2002) found women to
be somewhat more likely to train. Swiss data showed that,
due to their higher rates of participation in paid work, men
were also more likely than women to participate in further
training (FSO, 2010).
The payback period is also shorter for older employees.
Age indeed tended to be negatively related to participation in
further training (FSO, 2010). Taylor and Urwin (2001) found
that the lower participation rate of older workers was not the
result of individual preferences but of employer decisions.
Moreover, employees with a low educational level had the
lowest probability of participating in further training (Albert
et al., 2010; Fouarge, Schils, & de Grip, 2010; FSO, 2010).
Yet, due to their weak position on the labor market, employ-
ees with a low education level are most in need of further
training to increase their competitiveness (Dieckhoff, 2007).
Among the individual factors that influence participation
in further training, impaired health was identified as a con-
straint for further training as training requires high personal
investment and energy levels (Sussman, 2002).
Some studies did also consider family factors for the
employee's likelihood to train. The presence of a partner is
supposed to positively impact on the employee's probability
to train due to his/her support and children may function as
both, a resource or a constraint, depending on the employee's
family role (Greenhaus & Powell, 2012; Maurer, Weiss, &
Barbeite, 2003). Previous research found evidence for the
presence of young children to reduce participation in further
4 SAGE Open
training (Green, 1993; Harris, 1999; Sussman, 2002). In con-
trast, findings for partner status were less clear: Elman and
O'Rand (2002) did not find an influence of marital status on
participation rates. In contrast, Harris (1999) identified single
men, and Green (1993) married women, as less likely to par-
ticipate. Furthermore, the economic situation of the house-
hold turned out to influence an individual's likelihood to
train: Sussman (2002) showed that financial issues came into
account for 40% of Canadian employees reporting that they
did not participate in further training because of the high
expense. In the case of Switzerland, the training costs may be
an issue as only around 30% of employees received training
that was financially supported by their employer (FSO, 2014).
However, these studies did not show whether the family-
related factors functioned as a resource or a constraint in the
context of high perceived employment insecurity. Therefore,
we will address this issue in the present study.
An Unresolved Issue
The literature review demonstrated that participation in fur-
ther training is highly selective, and it becomes apparent that
there are conflicting results concerning the determinants of
participation in further training (i.e., the perceived level of job
insecurity, tenure, workload, partner status, and gender). The
self-selection into further training may lead to biased esti-
mates for the effect of further training on perceived job inse-
curity. Although less investigated, family-related factors such
as children, the partner, or the financial situation of the house-
hold were identified as important predictors of an individual's
probability to train. Yet the family context may not only con-
tribute to the observed selectivity for participation in further
training but also moderate the relationship between perceived
employment insecurity and participation in further training.
In the next chapter we will discuss our expectations in detail.
Furthermore, we have shown that previous research
mainly focused on unemployment and perceived job insecu-
rity, and little is known about the impact of further training
on perceived employment insecurity. It should be considered
that participation in further training may not prevent the loss
of the current job, but it may nevertheless increase employ-
ability which is assumed to reduce perceived employment
insecurity. Chung and van Oorschot (2011) have shown that
employees in countries with high expenditure on active labor
market policies (such as further training) perceive lower lev-
els of employment insecurity. However, it is not possible to
deduce from this study whether participation in further train-
ing measured on the individual level impacts on perceived
employment insecurity.
Moreover, nothing is known about the effect of further
training on the perception of insecurity in Switzerland.
Presumably, due to comparatively low levels of unemploy-
ment and high productivity (Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2013), employees in
Switzerland report comparatively low levels of employment
insecurity (Mau, Mewes, & Schöneck, 2012). However,
Switzerland has a weak employment protection (Straubhaar &
Werner, 2003): Every employee can be dismissed with a notice
of 1 to 3 months (depending on the duration of service).
Therefore, every employment has some degree of inherent
insecurity and every employee may suddenly have to compete
on the labor market to find new employment. In the context of
weak employment protection, keeping one's skills up to date is
crucial. The share of companies based in Switzerland that sup-
port their employees' training activities is one of the highest
among the European countries (FSO, 2014). Yet, on an indi-
vidual level, participation rates within these supporting com-
panies are below average which emphasizes the selectivity of
participation (FSO, 2014). Furthermore, Gerfin and Lechner
(2002) and Lalive et al. (2008) have shown that further train-
ing has a rather weak impact on the individuals' chances to
find a way out of unemployment. Therefore, it may be of inter-
est to policy makers to understand whether further training has
an impact on the subjective dimension of insecurity.
To address the mentioned shortcomings, we use Swiss
longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) and
apply a PSM procedure to investigate whether participation
in further training subsequently decreases perceived employ-
ment insecurity when accounting for the family context.
Theoretical Perspectives
Participation in Further Training as a Strategy to
Reduce Perceived Employment Insecurity
In what follows, we will focus on perceived employment
insecurity, that is employees who do not only see their cur-
rent job as insecure but also evaluate their labor market pros-
pects as weak and therefore perceive a high risk of becoming
unemployed in the near future (Anderson & Pontusson,
2007; Dixon et al., 2013).
An individual who experiences a discrepancy between the
desired and the actual level of employment security engages
in behavior aimed at a reduction of the perceived insecurity.
One possible strategy is investment in human capital by par-
ticipating in further training (Kyndt & Baert, 2013).According
to Schwarzer and Taubert (2002), this strategy can be consid-
ered anticipatory or preventive. If the occurrence of job loss
is a fairly certain event, participation in further training is
anticipatory and directed toward better coping with the
impending event. If the threat of job loss is less acute and its
occurrence less likely, participation in further training can be
considered a preventive strategy that mainly aims at reducing
the risk of the event actually occurring. According to the
human capital approach, further training is a means to embed
resources in employees (Becker, 1962). Therefore, we assume
that participation in further training is one strategy that
employees who feel insecure adopt: keeping one's skills up to
date offers protection from dismissal and increases employ-
ability (FSO, 2010; Lang, 2012; Smith, 2010).
Lebert and Antal 5
Hypothesis 1: The higher the perceived employment inse-
curity, the more likely participation in further training.
Family-Related Factors Influencing Participation in
Further Training
In this study, we put particular stress on family-related fac-
tors as they often receive little attention although they influ-
ence decisions in the work domain. Greenhaus and Powell
(2012) refer to this as the family-relatedness of work deci-
sions, that is the extent to which demands and responsibili-
ties in the family domain affect decisions in the work domain.
We consider three family-related factors as influencing an
employee's probability of engaging in further training. First
is the partner status, second the presence of preschool-aged
children, and third the economic situation of the household.
On the one hand, singles (if they do not have children or
other important family responsibilities) are free in their use
of time as they do not have to conciliate their own activities
with those of a partner (Burchardt, 2010). On the other hand,
they are restricted in sharing duties such as securing an
income, keeping house, or organizational and administrative
tasks. In contrast, individuals with a partner are less free in
their time use because they need to consider their partner's
activities (Burchardt, 2010). However, Burchardt (2010) has
shown that partnered individuals nevertheless have more
time at their free disposal when income (i.e., the possibility
to purchase goods and services) is considered. Partnered
individuals generally also have higher social capital
(Burchardt, 2010; Verbakel & de Graaf, 2009) and can share
duties and provide support for each other. For participation
in further training, this can mean that the partner provides
emotional support by encouraging participation, and practi-
cal support by making some time available to the other part-
ner to invest in further training (e.g., by taking over household
chores, taking care of the children) or providing information
and assistance (Maurer et al., 2003; Verbakel & de Graaf,
2009). Therefore, we consider a partner to be a resource, and
formulate the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Partnered employees are more likely to
participate in further training than employees without a
partner (direct effect).
We furthermore expect that the partner is particularly
likely to function as a resource if support is de facto needed
(Cohen & McKay, 1984), that is if an employee perceives
high employment insecurity. In that case, the partner can be
supportive and actively help engaging in strategies such as
further training. Therefore, we assume partnered employees
to be even more likely to participate in further training if they
perceive high levels of employment insecurity:
Hypothesis 3: Having a partner moderates the relation-
ship between perceived employment insecurity and
further training (interaction). Partnered employees are
expected to be more likely to train when perceiving high
employment insecurity compared with insecure employ-
ees without a partner.
Preschool-aged children are assumed to inhibit the prob-
ability of an individual to participate in further training when
he or she has high responsibilities in family work. Individuals
highly involved in family work have less time available, are
dependent on external child care provision, and therefore
less flexible in their time management (Burchardt, 2010;
Crouter, 1984). Paid and unpaid work--and it is particularly
the case in Switzerland--are usually not equally distributed
in couples (Baumgartner, 2008): In most households, women
take over the lion's share of childcare activities whereas men
have the main responsibility for the financial well-being of
the family. According to Greenhaus and Powell (2012), work
decisions are highly influenced by the individual's work and
family roles. Accordingly, women are expected to take deci-
sions that ensure the care and emotional well-being of the
children, whereas men tend to take decisions that increase
their employability and ultimately the family's financial
resources. As a consequence of lower time resources and
their family role, women are expected to be less likely to
train when they have preschool-aged children. In contrast,
men are expected to be more likely to train when they have
preschool-aged children, as further training increases their
employability and subsequently may enhance the family's
financial resources (Chan & Auster, 2003):
Hypothesis 4: Women living with preschool-aged children
are less likely to participate in further training than women
not living with preschool-aged children whereas men liv-
ing with preschool-aged children are more likely to partici-
pate than men not living with preschool-aged children.
In the face of perceived employment insecurity, we
believe children to function as an incentive for their parents
to secure a stable financial situation for the family. Nolan
(2009) has demonstrated that parents would accept scaling
down their standard of living in case of job loss if it was only
for them, but they do not want it for their children. Therefore,
we expect insecure individuals with children to be more
likely to participate in further training as a strategy to reduce
perceived employment insecurity. The constraint of pre-
school-aged children on their mothers' participation in fur-
ther training is expected to disappear in the context of high
perceived employment insecurity.
Hypothesis 5: Individuals (men and women) with pre-
school-aged children who perceive high employment
insecurity are more likely to participate in further train-
ing compared with insecure individuals without pre-
school-aged children. The effect of gender is expected to
disappear.
6 SAGE Open
Furthermore, employees who experience economic hard-
ship are assumed to be less likely to participate in further
training because they cannot afford the tuition fees, addi-
tional arising expenses, and opportunity costs (Sussman,
2002). In Switzerland, individuals pay 1,376 CHF on aver-
age for their participation in further training (tuition fees and
travel costs; FSO, 2014).
Hypothesis 6: Employees with economic hardship are
less likely to participate in further training compared
with employees without economic hardship (direct
effect).
Employees who perceive high levels of employment
insecurity are most in need of strategies to increase their
employability, even more so if they already face economic
hardship. However, we assume that these employees can-
not afford the expenses related to further training
(Sussman, 2002). Therefore, employees who experience
both employment insecurity and economic hardship may
turn to other strategies and be less likely to participate in
further training compared with individuals who perceive
high employment insecurity but do not experience eco-
nomic hardship.
Hypothesis 7: Economic hardship moderates the rela-
tionship between employment insecurity and further
training. Employees with economic hardship and high
perceived employment insecurity are less likely to partici-
pate in further training compared with insecure employ-
ees without economic hardship (interaction).
The Consequences of Further Training for
Perceived Employment Insecurity
Summing up, we have argued that participation in further
training is a strategy that employees who feel insecure adopt
to reduce their employment insecurity and that the decision
to train is influenced by the family context. Yet, research has
shown that participation in further training is also highly
influenced by the support of the employer (Kyndt & Baert,
2013): If the training activities of the employees are benefi-
cial for the company, employers may support them (Mincer,
1989). A high share of companies encourage and support
employees in their training activities by bearing (part of) the
costs and/or time investments (FSO, 2010) or by valuing and
encouraging participation and offering flexibility for training
activities (Kyndt & Baert, 2013). Although employer-sup-
ported further training may be firm-specific and therefore not
necessarily relevant for a future job with a new employer
(Mincer, 1989), the employee who received support of the
employer for his/her training activities can derive some
degree of job security as the investment is only cost-effective
for the employer if the trained employee is retained in the
company after the acquisition of the new skills and
knowledge (Fleischhauer, 2007). If further training (whether
employer-supported or not) is transferable to other compa-
nies, it is assumed to increase employability and reduce per-
ceived employment insecurity (Mincer, 1989). On the one
hand, the employee may protect his/her current job through
the increased skills and knowledge, and on the other hand,
he/she may gain in competitiveness and confidence in find-
ing new (equivalent) employment if job loss occurs (Becker,
1962; Smith, 2010).
Hypothesis 8: Participation in further training reduces
perceived employment insecurity.
The perception of employment insecurity does not only
depend on one's employability and training activities but
on a series of individual, work-, and family-related factors.
For this we refer to the existing literature. The following
factors are concerned and will be considered in the empiri-
cal section: type of contract and size of the company, posi-
tion within a company and recent change of employer,
workload, public versus private sector, industrial sector as
well as unemployment rates (Anderson & Pontusson,
2007; Chung & van Oorschot, 2011; Dixon et al., 2013;
Green, 2009).
In addition to the work-related factors, some family-
related and individual factors are concerned: being partnered,
having children and experiencing economic hardship, health
status, gender, age, and educational level (Anderson &
Pontusson, 2007; Chung & van Oorschot, 2011; Dixon et al.,
2013; Green, 2009).
Data and Method
Data
We used data from 2004 to 2013 from the SHP. The SHP is
a longitudinal household study that repeatedly surveys a
general sample of the Swiss population by means of stan-
dardized computer-assisted telephone interviews. In 1999,
the Swiss Federal Statistical Office drew a random sample
of which 7,799 individuals in 5,074 households partici-
pated. All household members of 14 years of age or more
were interviewed annually on a multitude of topics, includ-
ing employment, training, family life, and so on. It is com-
mon for household panel studies to face attrition, and so
does the SHP. In 2004, 3,076 original sample members
remained in the sample. Therefore, in 2004, a refreshment
sample of 2,538 participating households with 3,654 indi-
viduals was taken by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office.
In 2013 a second refreshment sample of 4,369 household
was taken, but as it started with a retrospective life calen-
dar, the necessary information was not available. Therefore,
the analyses are based on the first and second sample only.
The combined sample consisted of 6,730 individuals in
2004. As new household members joined the existing
households and participated in the study, a total of 12,906
Lebert and Antal 7
individuals filled out the questionnaire at least once
between 2004 and 2013.
Our analyses included all individuals who participated in the
survey in at least two consecutive waves from 2004 to 2013 and
were in paid work at each time point of those observations (7,576
individuals, i.e., 59% of the initial sample). We further restricted
our sample to individuals of 18 years of age and more but
younger than the official age of retirement (64 years for women
and 65 for men; 7,206 individuals kept). To rule out young indi-
viduals who were taken care of by their parents, respondents
younger than 25 years, living with at least one parent, and cur-
rently in formal training were excluded from the analyses (6,787
individuals kept). The restriction of having at least two consecu-
tive observations had to be reapplied after the selection on age.
This led to a drop of further 357 individuals. We took account of
time by using lagged information for all the independent vari-
ables: as participation in further training was measured at time t0
,
the included independent variables were measured at time t-1
.
Moreover, the respondents needed to provide valid information
for all the variables included in the empirical models. Therefore,
581 individuals were excluded due to partial non-response. The
final sample consisted of 3,016 women with 12,435 observations
and 2,833 men with 12,381 observations.
Measures
Participation in further training.
Respondents were asked
whether they had undertaken training courses for professional
reasons such as looking for a new employment. No informa-
tion is available on the type of further training or the employ-
er's support. Participation in further training was dummy
coded, 1 indicating that the respondent had taken part in fur-
ther training since the previous interview, which was the case
for 43.7% of respondents between 2004 and 2013.
Perceived employment insecurity. As no information on affective
employment insecurity was available, we measured cognitive
perceived employment insecurity only, which was measured
with the question, "How do you evaluate the risk of becoming
unemployed in the next 12 months, if 0 means no risk at all
and 10 a real risk?" For descriptive statistics see Table 1
below.
Type of contract. To control for the type of contract, we dis-
tinguished between employees with a permanent, a fixed-
term, and an unspecified type of contract.
Position.To determine the individual's position within the
company, the respondents were asked whether the supervi-
sion of other employees was an official part of their job. If this
was the case, the respondents were coded 1, and 0 otherwise.
Change of employer.As the change of employer was mea-
sured at time t-1
, it was assured that the change of employer
took place before the potential participation in further
training.
Workload.According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office
(FSO, 2013), the respondents were regrouped into three cat-
egories: low workload with a percentage below 50 (in refer-
ence to a full-time job in the concerned company), medium
workload with 50% to 89%, and full-time with 90% to 100%.
Ongoing reorganization. The respondents were asked whether
their company was currently undergoing some form of reor-
ganization, restructuring, or privatization. As for a relatively
high share of respondents the information was not collected,
an unknown category was added to avoid further dropout due
to partial non-response.
Firm size. The size of the firm was measured with three cat-
egories: small firms with 1 to 24 employees, medium firms
with 25 to 99 employees, and large firms with 100 employ-
ees or more.
Sector.Respondents who worked for a public organization
were coded 0, respondents working for a private organiza-
tion were coded 1.
Occupation. To assess the employee's occupation, the Inter-
national Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) was
used (Ganzeboom & Treiman, 1996). As only few observa-
tions were in the armed forces, these respondents were
regrouped together with a residual group for whom no ISCO
code was available.
Regional unemployment rates.We used the regional unem-
ployment rates for the major regions of Switzerland (Lake
Geneva, Middleland, North-west Switzerland, Zurich, East
Switzerland, Central Switzerland and Ticino) provided by
the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Unemployment rates
were assessed for the region of residence of the
respondents.
Partner.The partner status was measured with a dummy
variable coded 1 for respondents with a partner.
Preschool-aged children. We distinguished between individu-
als living with preschool-aged children (younger than 7 years
of age) in the household (coded 1) and individuals without
preschool-aged children coded 0.
Economic hardship. It was based on a subjective evaluation of
the household's financial situation and measured with the
following question: "How do you manage on your house-
hold's current income, 0 means with great difficulty and 10
very easily?" As the variable was reverse coded, a high value
stands for great difficulties.
Educational level. For the educational level, three categories
were used: low level, which corresponded to lower second-
ary education; medium level for upper secondary education;
and high level for tertiary education.

Health status.Respondents were asked about their current
health. Those who responded that they felt "well" or "very
well" were considered to be in good health and coded 0; oth-
erwise they were coded 1 ("so, so," "not very well," or "not
well at all").
We further included age, gender as well as year-dummies
to control for period effects.
Methods
We used a PSM procedure developed by Rosenbaum and
Rubin (1983). This method is employed to estimate causal
treatment effects, and especially to evaluate labor market
policies. As one of the foci of this study is the evaluation of
the effect of participation in further training on the level of
perceived employment insecurity, the PSM is a well-adapted
method. An important strength of the PSM is its ability to
account for the self-selection into treatment and therefore to
reduce a potential bias due to unobserved heterogeneity
(Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008). Furthermore, the PSM does
not require functional assumptions.
Ideally, a change of perceived employment insecurity
should be measured on the same individual when he/she has
participated in training versus when he/she has not:
eff 1
i i i
Y Y
= ( ) ( )
- 0 ,
effi
is the theoretical change for person i, Yi
(1) is the level of
perceived employment insecurity of person i when he/she has
participated in further training and Yi
(0) when he/she has not.
As these outcomes cannot be observed both on the same indi-
vidual at the same time, the unobserved values (counterfac-
tual outcomes) are approximated by the mean value of
non-participants. As participants and non-participants differ
also in other characteristics (X variables), this approximation
may cause a selection bias. The basic idea of the matching
approach is to find the individuals among non-participants
(control group) who are the most similar to the participants
(treatment group) in all relevant pre-treatment characteristics.
To achieve this goal, balancing scores (functions of relevant X
variables so that the conditional distributions of these vari-
ables are independent of the assignment into treatment) are
applied. These balancing scores (propensity scores) are the
probabilities of participation in further training given observed
X variables (Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008). In a usual proce-
dure of estimation applying the PSM, first the propensity
scores are computed and then the matching procedure is
based on these scores. Finally, the estimation of the treatment
effect is evaluated on the so-called common support (overlap
of the propensity scores of the treatment and the control
group). The structure of the PSM is the following (Caliendo
& Kopeinig, 2008): the parameter to be estimated is

),
where eff is the effect to be estimated, T is the binary variable
for the treatment (T = 1 if the person has participated in fur-
ther training and T = 0 if not) and ATT is the average treat-
ment effect on the treated, that is the effect of participation in
further training on the level of perceived employment inse-
curity for the persons who effectively participated in the
training.
As the treatment variable is binary, a logit model with rele-
vant independent variables was adequate for estimating the pro-
pensity scores. Concerning the matching method applied, we
tested several methods such as the nearest neighbor, caliper,
radius, kernel, and local linear regression methods. For a com-
prehensive introduction to the PSM see Caliendo and Kopeinig
(2008). After comparing the matching qualities of these algo-
rithms applied on our data set, we opted to use the kernel algo-
rithm. This choice was not only based on the analytical results
but also on the theoretical properties: the kernel algorithm is a
non-parametric matching method that can be seen as a weighted
regression (Smith &Todd, 2005), as it uses weighted averages of
all individuals in the control group to construct the counterfac-
tual outcome. The main advantage of this method is that more
information is used and as a consequence the variance is reduced
and the results are more robust (Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008).
The estimation of the effect of participation in further
training on the level of perceived employment insecurity
was then evaluated on the matched sample using ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression. The variable of interest was
the difference in the level of perceived employment insecu-
rity measured on the same individual at time t0
and t-1
.
Concerning the included independent variables, the same
variables as for the estimation of the propensity scores were
used for time t-1
(lagged variables). To test the presence of
moderating effects as assumed with Hypotheses 3, 4, 5, and
7, we constructed interaction terms by multiplying the
concerned variables (Male × Preschool-Aged Child;
Employment Insecurity (EI) × Partner; EI × Preschool-
Aged Child; EI × Economic Hardship; EI × Male; EI ×
Male × Preschool-Aged Child).
As only the values of two consecutive years were con-
cerned, we used cross-sectional individual weights. Finally,
to deal with problems about normality, heteroscedasticity,
large residuals, and high leverage points, we computed
robust standard errors of the coefficients.
Results
We started with the logistic regression to calculate the propen-
sity scores. In a first step, we included all the relevant vari-
ables and the interaction term Male × Preschool-Aged Child to
test Hypotheses 1, 2, 4, and 6 (Model 1 in Table 2). In a second

step, all the interaction terms were included (Model 2 in
Table 2). As EI × Partner and EI × Economic Hardship were
not statistically significant and for reasons of parsimony of the
model, we removed them in a stepwise elimination procedure
based on the size of the p values. In a third step, we defined the
final model used for the estimation of the propensity scores
Lebert and Antal 11
(Model 3 in Table 2). It contained a three-way interaction to
test Hypothesis 5 (i.e., the interactions Male × Preschool-Aged
Child; EI × Preschool-Aged Child; EI × Male; EI × Male ×
Preschool-Aged Child).
Although the most relevant variables explaining partici-
pation in further training discussed in the literature have been
included, the pseudo R2 of .076 remained relatively low.
However, the PSM performed well (Table A1 in the
Appendix). The PSM reduced the bias on all but one variable
(ISCO Cat. 1), but the difference between participants and
non-participants remained non-significant on this variable.
One treated observation was off the common support and
therefore excluded from the analyses.
Hypothesis 1 assumed that employees perceiving high
employment insecurity were more likely to train. Yet the
results in Model 1 in Table 2 showed that the opposite was
the case: the higher the perceived level of employment inse-
curity at t-1
, the lower the odds of participation at t0
.Therefore,
no support was found for Hypothesis 1. This unexpected
result will be discussed in detail in the discussion section.
Regarding the family-related factors, Model 1 in Table 2
showed that they indeed matter for an employee's odds to
participate in further training. We found evidence for
Hypothesis 2 that expected employees with a partner to be
more likely to participate in further training: The odds of par-
ticipation at t0
were 19.5% (OR > 1: % = (OR-1)*100; OR
< 1: %= [(1/OR)-1]*100 [Pampel, 2000]) higher for those
with a partner compared with singles. With Hypothesis 3, we
assumed a moderating effect of the partner on the relation-
ship between perceived employment insecurity and the prob-
ability to participate in further training. Model 2 in Table 2
showed that the interaction term for EI × Partner was not
statistically significant. From this we deduced that in the
context of high perceived employment insecurity, there was
no additional impact of the partner on the probability to train.
Hypothesis 3 did not find empirical support.
Turning to the presence of preschool-aged children, we
found support for Hypothesis 4 assuming that preschool-
aged children constrained their mother's but not their
father's participation in further training. In fact, women's
likelihood to train was influenced by the presence of pre-
school-aged children in the household: Women not living
with preschool-aged children at t-1
had 44.0% higher odds of
participation at t0
compared with women who lived with
preschool-aged children. The inclusion of the interaction
term revealed that men not living with preschool-aged chil-
dren had 21.8% (= 44% - 65.8%) lower odds of participa-
tion compared with men who lived with preschool-aged
children. From these results, we deduced that women were
indeed constrained by their children when further training
was concerned. In contrast, for men preschool-aged children
were even an incentive to participate in further training.
With Hypothesis 5, we expected children to function as
an incentive in that they increase their parents'participation
in further training when the parents perceive high levels of
employment insecurity. The gender differences were
expected to disappear. Model 3 in Table 2 showed that
when including the three-way interaction, the effect of the
presence of preschool-aged children on the probability to
train remained as in Model 1: women with at least one pre-
school-aged child at t-1
were less likely, men with at least
one preschool-aged child more likely to train at t0
. Yet as
the interaction term EI × Male × Preschool-Aged Child was
not statistically significant, we could deduce that there was
no additional difference between men and women. What
was new was the finding that preschool-aged children mod-
erated the relationship between perceived employment
insecurity and further training. However, the direction of
the effect was unexpected: In the context of employment
insecurity, the presence of preschool-aged children did not
increase but decrease the parents' probability of participa-
tion in further training. Gender did not moderate the rela-
tionship between perceived employment insecurity and
participation in further training. Although Hypothesis 5
was mainly not supported by the data, we could indeed
observe that in the context of employment insecurity men
and women showed a more similar behavior related to par-
ticipation in further training.
Furthermore, we did not find statistically significant evi-
dence for employees experiencing economic hardship in
their household to be less likely to train (Hypothesis 6). Yet a
tendency in this direction could be observed with odds ratio
(OR) = 0.987 and p = .062 (Model 1 in Table 2).
Hypothesis 7 expected employees who experienced
economic hardship to moderate the relationship between
perceived employment insecurity and participation in fur-
ther training. As the interaction term EI × Economic
Hardship was not statistically significant, we rejected
Hypothesis 7 and concluded that the experience of eco-
nomic hardship did not further reduce the employees'
probability to train.
Table 3 depicts an OLS regression based on the matched
sample, explaining changes in perceived employment inse-
curity. With Hypothesis 8, we expected employees who par-
ticipated in further training to perceive reduced levels of
employment insecurity. Controlling for the individual,
work-, and family-related factors, the results showed that the
average treatment effect on the treated ATT is about 0.103
units, which means that participants indeed reduced their
levels of perceived employment insecurity. Therefore, we
maintain Hypothesis 8. Although N = 24,816 is relatively
large (what may influence significance), all the discussed
coefficients were important in size.
Furthermore, Table 3 showed what other factors influ-
enced perceived employment insecurity. The strongest pre-
dictor of a change in perceived employment insecurity was
the level of employment insecurity at time t-1
: Those who
perceived high employment insecurity experienced a
12 SAGE Open
decline. Agricultural and fishery workers (ISCO Cat. 6) as
well as supervisors reported reduced levels of employment
insecurity. In contrast, perceived employment insecurity
tended to increase among legislators, senior officials, and
managers (ISCO Cat. 1) as well as for employees who
worked for a company that was undergoing some form of
reorganization, for employees in medium and large firms
and for those working in the private sector. Results also
revealed that high regional unemployment rates translated
into increasing levels of perceived employment insecurity.
Among the family-related factors, only economic hard-
ship turned out to significantly contribute to explaining
changes in perceived employment insecurity: Employees
who experienced economic hardship in their household
tended to report increasing levels of perceived employment
insecurity. Furthermore, we could observe that older employ-
ees tended to report slightly decreasing, and employees in
poor health increasing levels of perceived employment inse-
curity. Compared with women, men tended to report reduced
levels of employment insecurity--but only if they perceived
a low level of employment insecurity at t-1
as indicated by the
significant interaction term.
Discussion
In this study, we addressed the question of whether employ-
ees perceiving high levels of employment insecurity par-
ticipated in further training and whether this participation
subsequently reduced perceived employment insecurity.
By applying a PSM procedure, we took account of the fact
that participation in further training is not randomly dis-
tributed in the population but dependent on individual,
work-, and family-related factors. We also drew particular
attention to the family context. Three main findings can be
highlighted.
First, our study shows that participation in further train-
ing is not a strategy that employees actively adopt to reduce
perceived employment insecurity, as those perceiving high
levels of employment insecurity are least likely to train.
This result is unexpected but can be explained by the
employer's support. Participation in further training is
highest when it is employer-supported (Kyndt & Baert,
2013). According to the human capital approach, employ-
ers invest in training when chances are high that their
investment becomes profitable (Becker, 1962; Mincer,
1989). If employees perceive high employment insecurity
as a result of objective circumstances, they may indeed not
be the ones employers invest in if it is uncertain whether
they will remain in the company. In addition, employees
who perceive high employment insecurity may invest their
energy in other strategies such as finding new employment
(Blau et al., 2008).
Second, our study shows that although further training is
not an active strategy to reduce employment insecurity, it

still achieves this: Employees who participated in further
training experience a decrease of perceived employment
insecurity. This finding is in line with a study that demon-
strated that employees who received adequate on-the-job
training felt positive about their job proficiency (Truitt,
2011). This, in turn, may increase the employee's confidence
to be a valuable member of the labor force and finally reduce
the level of perceived employment insecurity. Though we
applied a different methodological approach and focused on
perceived employment insecurity, our results are in line with
previous research that shows that further training increases
employability and reduces perceived job insecurity
(Bassanini, 2006; Chung & van Oorschot, 2011; Kohlrausch
& Rasner, 2014; Lang, 2012).
Third, we demonstrated that the family context impacts
employees' chances to train. The partner is a resource:
Compared with employees without a partner, partnered
employees are more likely to participate in further training.
This result is in line with research that has demonstrated that
support in the family domain positively affects behavior in
the work domain and the ways individuals deal with conflict-
ing demands from both domains (Adams, King, & King,
1996; Van Daalen, Willemsen, & Sanders, 2006; Wayne,
Randel, & Stevens, 2006). However, in the context of high
perceived employment insecurity, when employees actively
have to deal with their insecure condition, the partner does
not further increase the chances of participation in training.
From this we deduce that the benefit of having a partner is of
more general nature and not related to his/her support for
dealing with perceived employment insecurity, at least as far
as further training is concerned.
Our study also shows that the presence of preschool-
aged children constrains women's participation in further
training whereas it increases men's participation. This
finding is in accordance with the predominant work and
family roles of men and women in Switzerland. For
women, who in Switzerland usually have the main respon-
sibility for childcare and family work (Baumgartner,
2008), their restricted flexibility due to the presence of
preschool-aged children is reflected by reduced invest-
ments in their employability. In contrast, preschool-aged
children are an incentive for the often breadwinning men
in Switzerland (Baumgartner, 2008). As they usually have
high responsibilities for the financial well-being of the
family, they take career decisions that increase their
employability and the financial resources of the family
(Greenhaus, Peng, & Allen, 2012). However, when the
employees' level of perceived employment insecurity is
considered, it cannot be observed that gender differences
increase. Neither could we find empirical evidence for the
assumption that children function as an incentive and
enhance their parents' chances to train to increase their
employability. The opposite is true: Employees who per-
ceive high levels of employment insecurity and have at
least one preschool-aged child are less likely to train than
insecure employees without a preschool-aged child. As
there is no reason to believe that insecure parents fall into
inertia, we deduce from this result that insecure parents
may turn to other strategies such as finding employment
with a new employer (Blau et al., 2008; Cavanaugh & Noe,
1999; Lebert & Voorpostel, 2016).
Finally, we show that economic hardship is of subordi-
nate relevance when participation in further training is con-
cerned. Although there is a tendency for those who
experience economic hardship to be somewhat less likely to
train, no additional constraint for further training is observed
when economic hardship and employment insecurity cumu-
late. This finding may be explained by the fact that some
employees receive financial support from their employers
(FSO, 2014).
This study reveals some practical implications and points
to issues that future research should address. Obviously there
are ways to compensate for perceived employment insecu-
rity: Participation in further training reduces feelings of
employment insecurity. Consequently, as a practical measure
to reduce their employees' employment insecurity, employ-
ers could support their employees' training efforts through
financial or time-based support. Women with preschool-aged
children should receive particular support, as they are the
most constrained by their family context. Future research
should also consider other strategies that employees may
adopt to reduce perceived employment insecurity. Our study
demonstrates that it is important to take the family context
into account.
The results contribute to a better understanding of how
individuals deal with perceived employment insecurity
and the ways their family context influences their deci-
sions. Nevertheless, the study has some shortcomings.
First, it measures perceived employment insecurity using a
single-item measure. Although it has been shown that sin-
gle-item measures perform acceptably well (Wanous,
Reichers, & Hudy, 1997), the validity of results could
increase if more elaborate measurements are applied.
Second, the SHP does not include additional questions
concerning the type of further training or the support
received by the employer. Therefore, it is not possible to
analyze more detailed aspects of further training. Third,
for lack of space, not all the control variables could be
discussed in detail. Therefore, we mainly focused on the
variables of interest that were related to the hypotheses.
Fourth, pseudo R2 for the estimation of the propensity
score is relatively low. Future research should particularly
address the methodological issues that have arisen in this
study. However, our study shows that PSM reduces the
bias caused by self-selection into further training, and the
inclusion of family factors has proven useful to draw a
more precise picture of how individuals deal with employ-
ment insecurity.
