Introduction
Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most prevalent form of
gynecologic cancer affecting women in the United States,
with an estimated 60
050 new cases in 2016.1 Risk for
developing EC is strongly linked with obesity,2,3 which also
affects disease-specific and all-cause mortality.4 The rela-
tive risk of death as a result of the disease is 6.25 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI] = 3.75-10.42) for body mass index
(BMI) >40 kg/m2 versus normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9
kg/m2).5 However, the majority of EC survivors diagnosed
with early-stage disease actually die from cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and associated comorbidity.6 It is therefore
critical to reduce the excess burden of morbidity and mor-
tality associated with being obese as an EC survivor.4,7,8
However, obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition
that some consider a disease itself,9 and while weight loss is
challenging for most people, it may be especially so for
women who are concurrently dealing with a diagnosis of can-
cer. Novel behavioral interventions, such as those that include
a mindfulness-based approach, may offer one option for
changing dietary behaviors and healthy lifestyle behaviors
that may help with sustainable weight management.
Mindfulness is a Western conceptualization of a tradi-
tionally Eastern practice of meditation and concentration
that was popularized by Jon Kabat-Zinn, who describes

Abstract
Background: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) to address self-regulation and lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical
activity) may benefit endometrial cancer survivors (ECS), who are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality associated
with obesity. However, the acceptability of mindfulness training and whether it can augment behavior change in ECS is
unknown. We aimed to examine; 1) the feasibility of the Mindfulness in Motion + Diet (MIM+D) intervention and 2) the
preliminary efficacy of MIM+D for improving mindfulness, diet, PA and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Methods:
ECS (Mage=62.4, ±5yrs from diagnosis) completed assessments at baseline, 8 and 14 weeks. Feasibility was determined by
intervention completion surveys, attendance and adherence data. We used repeated measures ANOVA's (SPSS 22.0) and
effect size estimates (Cohen's d) to examine changes in mindfulness, diet, PA, and HRQL over time. Results: Thirteen ECS
(76%) completed the MIM+D program and attendance (6/8 sessions) was 90%. Women reported favorably on the overall
quality (mean of 4.75/5) and benefits of the MIM+D program; however, would have preferred receiving MIM+D closer to
diagnosis. Intention to treat analyses found MIM+D did not significantly improve any outcomes. However, an intervention
completers analysis showed significant change in mindfulness (p=.0039) and small to moderate estimates for change in fruits
and vegetable intake (d=.23), MVPA (d=.45), RAND SF-36: MCS (d=.46), and sleep quality (d=.68). Conclusions: Integrating
mindfulness training into behavioral interventions is feasible and ECS that adhere to these lifestyle programs may benefit.
However, future research should examine the-long term effects of mindfulness-based behavioral lifestyle interventions.

mindfulness as "paying attention in a particular way: on pur-
pose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally."10(p 4)
This focus on developing nonjudgmental awareness has
significant implications for the ways in which people react
to stressful life events and self-regulate their behavior.
Mindfulness can be thought of both as a practice and as a
state of awareness and has previously been the focus of a
number of interventions in cancer care. One review reports
that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are associated
with significant improvements in anxiety, depression,
stress, sexual difficulties, physiological arousal, and
immune functioning, as well as self-reported quality of
life.11 More recently, there has been a growing interest in
the potential of mindfulness-based approaches to support
weight loss efforts12,13 and as a way of controlling eating
habits.14 One hypothesis is that unregulated emotional
responses are often integrated into eating behaviors (emo-
tional eating); however, evidence is mixed.15 Broadly,
mindfulness posits that people need to slow down and dis-
engage from habitual automatic responses to environmental
or emotional cues, thereby providing space to cognitively
make better choices related to their lifestyle behaviors.
In terms of lifestyle modification, dietary adjustment
alone can be effective, but it is well established that diet in
combination with physical activity (PA) is the most benefi-
cial behavioral strategy, especially with regard to maintain-
ing healthy, metabolically active lean tissue.16 Therefore,
modifying both diet and PA to address obesity-related out-
comes in these survivors is critical. Not surprisingly, evi-
dence suggests that only a small number of survivors
currently meet the dietary (15% to 19%) and PA (12% to
29%) guidelines.7,17 However, to date, only a limited num-
ber of studies have examined lifestyle interventions that
aim to address this,18,19 none of which has incorporated
mindfulness into their intervention.
A recent review that included 8 studies--4 cross-sec-
tional, 1 retrospective, 1 prospective, and 2 randomized tri-
als--examined the relationships between obesity, diet, PA,
and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in EC survivors
and reported that meeting PA and dietary recommendations
was positively associated with overall HRQL. Obesity was
also negatively associated with HRQL, physical well-being,
and fatigue.20 While EC survivors do seem to have the
capacity to improve their lifestyle behaviors, especially in
the context of structured interventions, there is much evi-
dence to suggest that as a population, EC survivors do not
see their condition as especially threatening and therefore
are not motivated to change their behaviors. Furthermore,
interventions that aim to increase moderate to vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) to the level of the guidelines
(150 minutes)21 may be limited by the functional capacity
of morbidly obese women with no prior experience of exer-
cise; it is not yet clear if behavioral changes can occur with
less intensive contact or whether alternative methods of
supporting lifestyle change may be more or less efficacious.22
Because lifestyle behaviors are often complex, utilizing
comprehensive approaches to behavior change may hold
potential, especially in a hard-to-reach population, such as
EC survivors. In addition to mindfulness, another tech-
nique that is increasingly adopted as part of behavioral
interventions and in health coaching is motivational inter-
viewing (MI). Miller and Rollnick describe MI in lay terms
as "a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a
person's own motivation and commitment to change."23(p12)
A meta-analysis showed that MI has previously been effec-
tive in addressing BMI, total blood cholesterol, systolic
blood pressure, and alcohol use.22 Furthermore, mindful-
ness that leads to less emotional reactivity and nonjudg-
mental awareness may actually support the use of MI
techniques. For EC survivors, who are known to have poor
diets, low levels of PA, and diminished HRQL, mindful-
ness-based approaches could potentially be incorporated
into traditional lifestyle interventions to enhance adoption
of these healthy behaviors. We were therefore interested in
whether an alternative behavioral lifestyle intervention that
incorporated a mindfulness-based approach could feasibly
improve dietary and PA behaviors by enhancing behavioral
self-regulation.
As far as we know, this single-group, pre-post study is
the first to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
delivering a mindfulness-based dietary counselling inter-
vention (Mindfulness In Motion + Diet [MIM+D]) to a
group of overweight and obese, early-stage, type I EC sur-
vivors. Our primary hypothesis was that EC survivors
would be (a) interested in participating and (b) find the
MIM+D program feasible and acceptable. Secondary
exploratory aims of this study were to examine the effects
of the intervention on levels of mindfulness, diet, PA par-
ticipation, physical function, and HRQL. Our secondary
hypotheses were that, for those women who adhered to the
program, we would see improvements in mindfulness,
lifestyle behaviors, physical functioning, and HRQL. We
did not assess weight loss as a primary outcome given the
short time frame of the study, and while the intervention
was not focused on PA per se, it did incorporate gentle
yoga and a dietary counselling program that espoused the
benefits of PA. These data may inform the design and
delivery of subsequent lifestyle intervention trials target-
ing EC survivors.
Methods
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
(Cancer) of the Ohio State University. This pre-post inter-
vention study was designed to examine the feasibility and
preliminary efficacy of delivering a mindfulness-based
dietary counseling intervention to EC survivors. While the
primary focus was on diet, we were still interested in
Lucas et al 265
whether participants would begin to incorporate PA partici-
pation, based on its inclusion in conversations related to
diet and health. Over a period of 24 months, there were
approximately 500 EC patients treated through our
OB-GYN clinics, and we estimated that a minimum recruit-
ment rate of 15% would allow us to estimate effect sizes for
the design of a larger trial, while also allowing us to reach
our recruitment targets within the available timeframe. We
aimed to assess mindfulness, dietary behavior, PA, physical
function, and select HRQL outcomes in a group of surgi-
cally treated, early-stage (I and II) type I EC survivors.
Participants attended weekly sessions of the MIM+D inter-
vention for 8 weeks at the cancer center and transitioned to
home-based practice during weeks 9 to 14. Assessments
were completed at baseline, follow-up 1 (8 weeks), and
follow-up 2 (14 weeks). The person completing assess-
ments also delivered the intervention. To assess the feasibil-
ity of our approach, on completion of the study, we asked
participants to evaluate separately the mindfulness and
dietary counseling components of the study. Adherence was
tracked through attendance to study sessions and with self-
report logs.
Participants
The focal point for recruitment was a large metropolitan
university's gynecological (GYN) oncology clinic, but also
included patients of other local GYN oncology clinicians.
Patient records and in-clinic visits were the primary means
for identifying potential participants. After patients were
identified, the study staff conducted telephone-screening
interviews to assess interest and confirm that participants
satisfied the eligibility criteria (Table 1). They were then
scheduled baseline assessment visits. All possible subjects
must have been surgically staged and treated for type 1,
early-stage (I and II) EC. We targeted these women because
they were most at risk for disease recurrence, future comor-
bidity (CVD and type 2 diabetes), and experiencing com-
promised HRQL due to sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary
practices. The recruitment procedures for this study
included a combination of mail-out invitations and in-clinic
offers to participate in the study.
Mindfulness in Motion + Diet Intervention
Mindfulness in Motion (MIM)24 is an 8-week MBI that
emphasizes mindful yoga as a way to develop a healthy
relationship with the body and provides a practical strategy
for stress management. It includes music, yoga, and mind-
fulness instruction and practice, and has been described in
detail elsewhere.25 The movements and breathing exercises
are simple and can be practiced daily in the worksite or
home. Participants were provided with a CD/DVD and
guidelines for home-based mindfulness and yoga, as has
been done in prior studies, and is an integral part of the
protocol.25-28 The components of each week's MIM and
Dietary sessions are shown in Table 2. At 14 weeks, partici-
pants completed a second follow-up to determine the adher-
ence to the training postintervention and the efficacy of the
approach.
Dietary Counselling
The 30-minute dietary counselling sessions were conducted
by a registered dietitian. These sessions immediately fol-
lowed the MIM session during weeks 1 to 8. The specific
dietary objectives were consistent with the Therapeutic
Lifestyle Changes recommended in the Adult Treatment
Panel III Report of the National Cholesterol Education
Program29 and the American Institute of Cancer Research.30
The nutrition intervention encourages reductions in portion
size and caloric and fat consumption together with a gradual
transition from an animal-based diet to a more plant-rich
diet while still incorporating animal foods, including milk
and meat, with an emphasis on monitoring food proportion
and portion size. Specific goals of the dietary component
included: (a) reduction in energy intake by 500 to 1000 kcal

per day; (b) reduction in total fats to 25% to 30%, saturated
fats to 7%, and protein to 15% of total calories; (c) increase
in fruit and vegetable consumption to 5 servings per day;
and (d) intake of 3 or more servings of whole grains and a
gradual increase to at least 25 grams of dietary fiber per day.
The nutrition counseling used an MI approach that has been
demonstrated to be an effective approach to promote behav-
ior change in cancer patients.28,31 The nutrition counselling
also builds on cognitive-behavioral theory and self-man-
agement strategies32 as well as aspects of mindfulness uti-
lized in the MIM intervention. Participants were taught how
to set realistic goals for changing their dietary behavior,
while learning to self-monitor through the completion of
dietary logs. They were also taught the importance of antici-
pating and overcoming barriers to dietary behavior change.
These skills were intended to support and improve partici-
pant's self-efficacy for dietary behavior change. Participants
did not explicitly set goals of weight loss or for PA; how-
ever, they could have done this on their own using the tech-
niques taught. We specifically focused goal-setting on
dietary behavior itself, with the intention being that this
would foster weight loss in the long term. Broadly, this the-
ory-based intervention was designed to facilitate the devel-
opment of behavioral self-regulatory skills needed to
successfully adopt and maintain a change in dietary behav-
ior over the long term.
Measures
Demographics, medical history, mindfulness, dietary qual-
ity, and measures of psychosocial and HRQL/QOL (quality
of life) variables were conducted using surveys. We used
both self-report and accelerometry for PA and a standard
battery of functional tests for assessing physical function.
Finally, we assessed weight status using the IDXA lunar
(GE) for body composition.
Mindfulness was assessed with the 5-Facet Mindfulness
Questionnaire (FFMQ)33 and the Mindfulness Attention
Awareness Scale (MAAS).34 The FFMQ measure was created
using a factor analysis approach to identify the underlying
independent facets tapped by multiple mindfulness ques-
tionnaires and has demonstrated acceptable psychometric
properties when comparing experienced meditators with non-
meditators with  coefficients for all facets ranging from .67
to .92.33,35 The 5 underlying constructs targeted are Observing,
Acting with awareness, Nonreacting, Nonjudging, and
Describing--all of which have shown strong expected rela-
tionships with psychological metrics. The MAAS is a mea-
sure proposed to tap a unitary operationalization of
mindfulness and has been previously validated in a cancer
population.36
To measure the dietary intakes of EC survivors, we used
the Food Habits Questionnaire (FHQ).37 This measure was
developed as a screening tool for dietary quality related to
the prevention of cancer and CVD, with a focus on the
assessment of dietary fats and whole grains. It typically
includes 49 questions related to frequency of food intake
over 6 categories. In the RENO diet heart study, the test-
retest reliability of this measure was (Pearson r = .92) and a
Cronbach's  level of .85. It is recognized that there are
more in-depth analyses of food intakes available; however,
for the purposes of this study, we chose this measure for its
brevity as well as ability to capture meaningful data in con-
junction with other measures as part of a larger survey.
PA was assessed using both objective accelerometers
and self-reported data via the modified Paffenbarger
Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ)38 to measure weekly
MVPAlevels in EC survivors. PAparticipation was assessed
objectively with the uniaxial, Kenz LIFECORDER
(Suzuken Kenz Inc Limited, Tokyo, Japan) accelerometer.
The LIFECORDER (LC) has previously established valid-
ity and reliability.39-41 The PAQ measures the amount of
time typically spent by an individual in various types of PA,
including stair climbing, walking, and structured exercise.
Comparison of the level of accumulated weekly PA can be
made using the current American College of Sports
Medicine/US Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines of 150 minutes of MVPA per week. Prior
research has demonstrated the PAQ has acceptable valid-
ity and reliability.42 Physical function was assessed using 4

valid and reliable tests. The Short Physical Performance
Battery (SPPB) is composed of 3 subcomponents that test
balance, gait speed, and leg strength and endurance.43 We
also conducted 3 timed performance-related mobility tasks:
the 400-m walk, stair-climb, and lift and carry task.44-47 For
the 400-m walk, participants completed 10 clockwise laps
around a 40-m indoor course as quickly as possible. For the
stair-climb task, participants were timed while they
ascended a set of 10 stairs turning around at the top of the
platform, and then descending the stairs. In the lift and carry
task, participants picked up a container--weighing 10 lbs--
with both hands, turned and walked around a cone placed 5
m away. They then returned to the shelf to place the con-
tainer down. Performance on each test was measured in the
total time (in minutes and/or seconds) to complete the task.
Quality of life was assessed from both a global perspec-
tive as well as within a more disease specific context
(HRQL). Globally we used the Satisfaction with Life Scale
(SWLS), a 10-item, Likert-type questionnaire with reported
validity and reliability,48 and for the specific aspects of
HRQL we used the RAND SF-36, which is well-known and
has acceptable validity and reliability.49 The Pittsburg Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI) was used to sample typical sleep pat-
terns over the previous month, which is determined to be a
time frame within which transient issues with this aspect of
normal functioning may vary. The measure has been shown
to be valid and reliable in prior research.50
To assess the feasibility of our approach, on completion of
the study, we asked participants to evaluate separately the
mindfulness and dietary counseling components of the study
(Figure 2). Adherence was tracked through attendance to
study sessions and with self-report logs. The preliminary effi-
cacy analyses were conducted with the Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 22). Data were cleaned
and examined for outliers and missing values. SPSS by
default conducts analyses by dropping cases for which there
are missing data. We therefore carried data forward from the
last visit for which there was an assessment to conservatively
evaluate the effect of the intervention. Following an exami-
nation of the demographics of the study population, we con-
ducted bivariate correlations to determine the relationships
between the primary variables of interest. Alpha was set a
priori at a level of P = .05. Repeated-measures ANOVAs
were then used to determine the effects of the MIM+D inter-
vention on changes in all outcomes of interest.Analyses were
conducted using the intention-to-treat principle with the last-
value-carried-forward approach used to account for missing
data. Where assumptions of sphericity were violated as deter-
mined by Mauchley's test, we used the Greenhouse-Geisser
adjustment to interpret main effects. Given this was a feasi-
bility and preliminary efficacy study involving a small sam-
ple size, effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated by taking
the mean difference and dividing by the pooled standard
deviation to better estimate the meaningfulness of change for
each observed outcome following the intervention. By con-
vention, the values and meanings for effect size estimates are
a small effect size (d = .2), a moderate effect size (d = .5), and
a large effect size (d = .8). Finally, we also conducted an
exploratory analysis for intervention completers (adherence)
following the same steps as above where appropriate.
Results
Recruitment processes and flow are detailed in the
CONSORT diagram (Figure 1). Briefly, 438 patients were
screened and contacted about the study, leading to 43
(9.8%) that showed an interest. Of these, we excluded 26
patients who were (a) too active (5), (b) had recently par-
ticipated in yoga (3), (c) were underweight (4), (d) who

withdrew interest after receiving more details (9), and (e)
for miscellaneous reasons (5). There were a total of 17 par-
ticipants that completed baseline measures on all outcomes
of interest (40%). Two subjects did not start the interven-
tion due to scheduling conflicts, and a further 2 dropped
out by follow-up 1 and another 2 by follow-up 2, leaving a
total of 13/15 that completed the program (86%) but 11/17
who completed the entire study (65%). While we did have
some dropout over the course of the intervention, those
who completed the study reported a high level of satisfac-
tion with the intervention (Figure 2). In particular, it was
notable that the majority of the participants reported that
they felt they would have benefitted most from this inter-
vention had it been offered to them when they were first
diagnosed and early in the course of their treatment.
Women in the study were predominantly white (88%),
well-educated, with a mean age of 61.1 ± 7 years, considered
class I obese (BMI = 33.8 ± 6.5; body fat % = 46.8 ± 6.6),
with multiple comorbidities, including 30% who were type
2 diabetic, 65% who had hypertension, 24% with arthritis,
and 12% with depressive symptoms (see Table 3).
Interestingly, in the 2 women that were only slightly over-
weight by BMI criteria, body fat % (IDXA) measures
showed they were actually obese. Given the short time frame
of the study, we did not expect to see significant weight loss.
However, we did examine body composition changes for
those women who completed the intervention. These results
are reported with the rest of the intervention completion data
and are shown in Table 7. The 95% CIs for all analyses are
available by request from the corresponding author.
Mindfulness
Table 4 shows the results of the intervention on mindfulness
scores over time. For the 5 different factors of the FFMQ,
there were no statistically significant or meaningful effect
size changes over time. In terms of the MAAS, we again did
not see a statistically significant change (p = .15; 95% CI =
-0.58 to 0.09), but effect size estimates (Cohen's d = .22)
pointed toward a small improvement.
Dietary Quality
Food habits data are reported in Table 5. Scores in each cat-
egory represent the relative quality of eating habits, ranging
from poor to excellent. At baseline, only 2 women showed
poor choices in the grains category, with no scores below 8,
which indicates a high risk for cancer.37 There were no poor
choices in the fruits and vegetables category, 3 (18%) in the
fairly good range, and the rest (82%) in the excellent range.
However, 24% of women had poor dairy choices, with the
majority (59%) in the fair category. Meat scores are a mea-
sure of protein intake and include items such as beans and
fish. No subjects were in the poor category, 29% in the fair
category, 65% fairly good, and one in the excellent cate-
gory. The fats and oils category indicates the general way a
person cooks their meals or the type of meals they typically
choose if eating out. Eighty-eight percent of women were
making poor choices. Given the sample, this is not surpris-
ing. Seventy-seven percent of participants were making
poor choices in the "other" category, which referred to fast
food, sugary foods, and items such as alcoholic beverages.

There were no statistically significant changes in the dietary
quality of participants following the intervention. Effect
size estimates did not reveal any meaningful change either,
except for the Fats and Oils category where we actually
saw a moderate decline (d = -.44), though not significant
(p = .06; 95% CI = 0.31-2.5).
Physical Activity and Physical Function
Physical activity, physical function, and QOL are reported
in Table 6. At baseline, 6 (31%) participants self-reported
no daily PA; the objective PA assessment indicated that
80% of participants did not accrue even half of the recom-
mended weekly MVPA(M = 65.7, ±81.1). There was a wide
range of activity levels, but on average women were taking
about 5000 steps per day and accruing roughly 65 minutes
of MVPA and 330 minutes of light activity per week. The
intervention did not lead to any statistically significant
changes in activity levels; however, effect size estimates
revealed there were small changes in MVPA (d = .18) and
self-reported walking minutes (p = .18; 95% CI = -161.8 to
29.9; d = .41).
Physical functioning measures indicated that the major-
ity of the participants were high functioning. The overall
SPPB, gait speed, and balance were indicative of good
functioning; however, of the 3 tasks, women experienced
the most challenge completing the timed chair stands (M =
14.6, ±5.0), with 3 women taking more than 20 seconds to
complete this task. For all tests of PF, there was a larger
range in scores with some participants scoring on the low
end, indicating some deficits in functioning. Repeated-
measures ANOVAs showed that there was a significant
main effect of time on SPPB, F(1.38, 22.01) = 6.55, p =
.011; 95% CI = -0.38 to 0.03. Effect size estimates revealed
a moderate effect size (d = .60). For the chair stand aspect
of the SPPB, results showed a significant main effect of
time, F(2, 32) = 6.38, p = <.01; 95% CI = 0.67 to 3.8, and
effect size estimates indicated a moderate effect (d = .42).
There was no significant main effect of time on stair climb
time, F(2, 32) = 0.02, p = .98; however, effect size estimates
indicated that there was a small change (d = .17) and no
other significant effects of the intervention on aspects of
physical function, including the 400-m walk test or the lift
and carry test.

For generic HRQL, the RAND SF-36 component sum-
mary scales showed that, in general, women in the study
reported high mental and physical HRQL; however, at base-
line the physical component scale was slightly higher than
the mental component subscale, 75.9 ± 17.2 versus 81.7 ±
10.0. Despite a high baseline level of HRQL, following the
intervention, effect size estimates indicated that there was a
slight improvement in the mental component summary
scale (d = .17); however, this was not statistically signifi-
cant. The PSQI, a self-report measure of sleep quality with
7 distinct component scores, indicated the mean score at
baseline was M = 11.8 ± 3.2, and while effect size estimates
indicate there was a moderate improvement (d = .45) over
time, this was neither statistically significant (p = .06; 95%
CI = -0.19 to 2.9) nor clinically meaningful, as the mean
score was still above 5 following the study, indicating on
average a poor quality of sleep. Globally, QOL was mea-
sured with the SWLS. Findings yielded a mean score of
M = 25.6 ± 8.1 (p = .06; 95% CI = -3.1 to -0.01), which,
according to the norms provided by Diener et al,48 would be
considered high. This is again an indication that there was
an overall high quality of life reported within this sample.
However, it should again be noted that there were certain
individuals who had a relatively poor score on this measure,
with a low score of 5 reported.
Intervention Completers' Analysis
In an exploratory sense, we ran analyses for the EC survi-
vors that completed the entire study to get a sense of the
potential benefits of the intervention for those women who
adhered (not shown in tables). While there were no signifi-
cant changes in body composition we did explore these out-
comes further (Table 7). On average, women lost 0.6%
body fat and roughly 2 lbs of body weight over the course
of the intervention. Interestingly, we saw that visceral adi-
pose tissue increased slightly, which was deemed a signifi-
cant change despite being a small effect. For the rest of the

analyses, we specifically focused on measures that effect
size estimates indicated had potentially changed.
Mindfulness measured with the MAAS was significantly
improved, F(2, 18) = 3.924, p = .039, with an effect size
estimate of (d = .63). In terms of dietary intake, for the Fats
and Oils category, while not significant, the effect size esti-
mate increased (d = 1.86), as it did for fruits and vegetables
(d = .23). There were no significant changes in PA; how-
ever, the effect size estimate for steps per day (d = .53)
showed a moderate effect, LPA (d = .28) and MVPA (d =
.45). It should be noted that this effect is most likely due to
a few individuals who increased their exercise markedly
over the course of the intervention. In terms of PAQ self-
report, for walking, the pattern was the same with an effect
size change to (d = .53). For physical functioning, repeated-
measure ANOVAs only indicated a significant main effect
of time on chair stand performance, F(1, 9) = 16.958, p =
.003, a component of the SPPB. For quality of life, the men-
tal component scale (MCS) of the RAND SF-36 did not
significantly change, but the effect size estimate did slightly
increase (d = .46). Sleep quality did not significantly change
for intervention completers, F(2, 20) = 3.271, p = .059, but
the effect size estimates did indicate a moderate improve-
ment (d = .68).
Discussion
This single-group, pre-post study examined the feasibility
and preliminary efficacy of a novel mindfulness-based life-
style intervention in EC survivors. Despite recruiting chal-
lenges, women who were eligible and completed the study
reported favorably on the intervention. Seventeen women
participated in baseline screening, 13 of whom completed
the intervention (76%). We did not see changes in dietary
behavior; however, there was some evidence that outcomes
important to cancer survivors may have improved. From a
preliminary efficacy standpoint, there may be some poten-
tial for incorporating a MBI into more conventional behav-
ioral lifestyle approaches for EC survivors; however, the
small sample size and study design mean further investiga-
tion is warranted.
From the demographics of the study participants, it is
apparent that obesity was prevalent and that a high burden
of comorbidity existed, further reinforcing the need for
behavioral modification in this group of survivors.4
Particularly interesting was the fact that 2 participants who
were only marginally overweight by BMI criteria were
found to have a high degree of body fatness when assessed
on the IDXA, a more accurate measurement of body fat.
The implications of this are that while BMI is useful for
determining risk in a large population, individually women
who have poor dietary habits and who do not engage in PA
may still have high levels of adipose tissue. This is a spe-
cific risk factor for developing type I EC and further places
these women at high risk for future comorbidity.51 Lifestyle
modification is therefore an important goal for overweight
and obese EC patients and survivors who (a) may be at risk
for disease recurrence and (b) have a high burden of comor-
bidity and reduced quality of life.17,20,52-54 Despite the well-
known characteristics of this patient population (sedentary,
poor diet, and high comorbidity), there are few systematic,
supportive care approaches focused on healthy lifestyle
behaviors during survivorship.
One study--a randomized controlled trial designed to
test the feasibility of a lifestyle intervention for weight loss
and PA in 55 EC survivors--did find that women in the life-
style arm lost weight and increased their PA relative to the
control group at 1 year.55 The authors also examined HRQL
and mediators of change in the feasibility intervention and
reported that self-efficacy was much lower in morbidly
obese survivors and that the intervention did not improve
HRQL.56 In a larger follow-up trial, these findings were
confirmed, suggesting that lifestyle interventions can be
effective when survivors adhere to exercise and dietary
guidance.57 More recently, Basen-Engquist and colleagues
examined the response of obese versus nonobese EC survi-
vors to an exercise intervention. In the STEPS to Health
study, 100 posttreatment, stage I-IIIa survivors participated
in a single-arm 6-month study of home-based exercise. At
baseline, obese survivors had worse cardiorespiratory fit-
ness and self-reported measures of HRQL.58 While non-
obese survivors improved their fitness and exercise behavior
to a greater extent than obese survivors did, both groups
improved their HRQL and reduced stress to the same
degree. Obese survivors also improved their exercise from
their baseline levels.
From a feasibility standpoint, there were some difficul-
ties in recruiting patients to this study. One example of the
kind of difficulties met was the response from one particu-
lar EC patient when asked about her interest in a lifestyle
intervention study for healthy EC survivorship. She replied
that she "had been treated for her cancer and was now bet-
ter." This perhaps is an indication of the fact that many
patients are not acutely aware of the importance of lifestyle
behaviors on their risk for developing EC in the first place
or on their continued health following diagnosis.59 While
clinicians do recognize the importance of weight loss and
increasing PA for these patients, they do not always have
the time or the specialized training to meaningfully impact
this aspect of their patient's lives.60,61 Furthermore, women
with type I EC may be unique as cancer patients and survi-
vors in part due to the fact that the majority of them are
surgically treated without adjuvant therapies and are survi-
vors at 5 years postdiagnosis.62 Despite these challenges,
women who did show an interest in the study reported
favorably on both the mindfulness training and the dietary
counselling components. The once-weekly meeting sched-
ule was also an achievable demand on time. It was reported
272 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(3)
by one woman that she had become uncomfortable because
she had begun to feel responsible for causing her health
problems; while unfortunate, there is always a concern that
a program to increase awareness will cause some psycho-
logical discomfort and therefore this was specifically
addressed as a risk in the informed consent document.
Overall, we do feel this type of intervention is safe and fea-
sible in this population of cancer survivors.
Due to the small sample size, we were not statistically
powered to detect significant differences in primary or sec-
ondary outcomes. However, we still felt it was valuable to
explore the preliminary efficacy of our intervention.
Specifically, we did not see statistically significant improve-
ments in mindfulness measured with the FFMQ, dietary
quality,PA,orHRQLutilizinganintention-to-treatapproach.
Effect size estimates and an exploratory completers'analysis
did indicate the potential of our intervention to improve
some outcomes. Results for the FFMQ at baseline showed
that EC survivors had similar scores compared with a popu-
lation of regular meditators, meaning it may be that we saw
a ceiling effect with the FFMQ as these scores were already
high at baseline. Scores for the MAAS at baseline were,
mean = 4.44, SD = 0.79), which were also similar to those
previously found in a mixed group of cancer patients (mean
= 4.2, SD = 0.64) and a large US adult sample (mean = 4.26,
SD = 0.63) but slightly higher than another sample of cancer
patients (mean = 4.08, SD = 0.74).36 We did see a significant
improvement measured with the MAAS, and it is feasible
that this unitary operationalization of mindfulness was more
specifically targeted by the intervention. While a number of
studies have explored the role of mindfulness in the context
of weight loss, the findings are mixed.12-15 The role of self-
efficacy in relation to weight loss has also been examined in
other studies. Findings from the SUCCEED trial indicated
that improvements in self-efficacy accompanied a decrease
in BMI following a lifestyle intervention.18 While there has
been no specific examination of mindfulness, self-efficacy
and their relationship to weight loss in EC patients, Rejeski
and colleagues have previously found that changes in the
Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire partially mediated
the effects of their lifestyle intervention on weight loss.63
There is also some evidence that coping self-efficacy may
mediate the relationship between aspects of mindfulness and
emotion regulation,64 and that mindfulness still predicts
depression, anxiety, stress, and well-being even when
accounting for self-efficacy.65 This may suggest that mind-
fulness can still offer unique benefits beyond those found in
more traditional behavioral interventions focused on improv-
ing self-efficacy.
The most interesting findings were related to dietary
quality. The FHQ has been shown to be positively correlated
with more robust 3-day food records,37 but may be limited in
its capacity to capture the details of dietary patterns.
However, in general, we expected to see poorer scores in
most categories and that they would improve as a result of
the intervention. One possibility is that women had an
awareness of the importance of a healthy diet (eg, fruit and
vegetable intake) and this led to them self-reporting higher
than expected scores at baseline. Once they had been taught
to identify healthy foods and patterns of eating, they may
then have more accurately reported on their dietary patterns,
and this was reflected as a worsening of scores over time.
Despite this, we did see women self-report in the poor cate-
gory for both "fats and oils" and the "other" category that
reflects fast food and high-fat cooking methods, which
would confirm poor eating habits. In a similar fashion, we
did not see PA, as measured objectively, improve signifi-
cantly. We did, however, find some women who increased
their walking and MVPA a great deal. Furthermore, self-
report did show a modest increase in PA overall. Again, this
intervention talked about the importance of MVPA but did
not specifically aim to increase this in a structured way, as
with the dietary counseling. The introduction of gentle yoga
and the mention of PA may have resulted in the improved
physical functioning we saw reflected in the improved
SPPB, even though none of the scores indicated risk for
future disability (<10). The primary driver of this change
seemed to be the chair stand time. This may have been a
reflection of improved technique or simply an increased
motivation on the part of the participants. In terms of the
HRQL and QOL broadly, we again saw high scores at base-
line, meaning it was unlikely we would see much improve-
ment. However, there were still some women who reported
low levels initially and who did respond positively, and
although not significant, Cohen's d did indicate a small posi-
tive effect. Sleep quality is particularly responsive to mind-
fulness training24 and that may have been the case here.
Despite not improving to a level below the cutoff for poor
sleep quality (>5 indicates a poor quality of sleep), sleep
quality still improved when looking at the completers' anal-
ysis and effect size estimates. This finding warrants further
examination in this population, as many health problems and
comorbidities, including fatigue, depression, hypertension,
and CVD risk, are associated with poor sleep quality.66,67
There were a number of limitations to the current study.
First, we conducted multiple statistical tests on a limited
data set and therefore the likelihood of making a type 1
error was high. Because this was an exploratory study, pri-
marily to test feasibility, we felt it was valuable to explore
the potential effects of the intervention. Additionally, we
were underpowered to detect significant changes in our
outcomes, and a larger number of women would have
allowed a more robust examination of the interventions
effects. We also lacked either a no-treatment or different
treatment control group for comparative purposes. We had
initially proposed such an intervention, but limitations in
the recruitment schedule meant we focused on a single-arm
intervention. We did not have a large number of minority
participants, which is typical of many research studies, but
in the future, there should be a significant effort to include
Lucas et al 273
a representative proportion of survivors in order to refine
recommendations and determine which programs will be
of most benefit based on cultural norms and expectations
of supportive care. We would urge some caution with
regard to the generalizability of the findings of the current
study. Specifically, the enrollment challenges indicate that
large numbers of EC survivors may not be interested in this
type of intervention. Hard-to-reach populations require a
multipronged approach to recruitment that includes both
mail and in-person contact, providing access to informa-
tion sessions to generate interest and especially by garner-
ing support of the clinical providers. If possible and
feasible, providing incentives to participation with the use
of travel vouchers or gift cards can also be of help. Another
limitation of this study related to recruitment was a lack of
adequate surveys to determine why women were not inter-
ested in this study. This could have provided important
information that would serve to improve enrollment in
future studies. Another limitation was that the same person
conducted the assessments and delivered part of the inter-
vention, which could have biased some of the results.
Finally, adherence to home-based mindfulness training and
dietary logs was self-reported and impossible to verify.
Strengths of this study were that we began by conducting
a theory-based examination of PA and dietary behavior in the
same population to refine and target the intervention. The
Mindfulness in Motion and the Dietary counselling portions
of the intervention have both been previously validated in
research studies.24,26,68 However, this was the first time they
have been combined to target a unique population of cancer
survivors in order to improve lifestyle behaviors and poten-
tially relevant health outcomes. Most traditional approaches
to weight loss (increasing PA and improving diet) may be
seen as particularly challenging for women who are dealing
with a diagnosis of cancer, obesity, and trying to manage
multiple comorbidities. This approach therefore aimed to
reduce the impact of psychological barriers (anxiety, depres-
sion) to making healthy lifestyle choices by increasing survi-
vors' ability to self-regulate their behavior (eg, improving
diet). This skill set would then hypothetically "prime" par-
ticipants to be more receptive to making healthy eating
choices and engaging in PA. It should be noted that a recent
study by Zhang et al examined the proportion of EC patients
that would be safely able to exercise based on their medical
charts.69 Only 14% of patients were deemed safely able to
exercise unsupervised, which points to the need for programs
where lifestyle change can be gradual and/or staged.
Mindfulness training that incorporates gentle yoga and move-
ment first may then pave the way for more substantial behav-
ior change efforts, such as starting an exercise program.
Conclusions
Despite the limitations of the current study, a number of
which related to challenges with recruiting an adequate
sample, there does seem to be some potential for develop-
ing and disseminating novel behavioral lifestyle programs
for EC patients and survivors. There is a significant need
to improve diet and increase PA in this population and
developing approaches that (a) are acceptable and achiev-
able by a large number of women dealing with a diagnosis
of cancer and comorbidity concurrently and (b) can
enhance the capacity of women to self-regulate their
behavior and successfully maintain healthy lifestyles
even in the face of challenging psychosocial barriers,
such as anxiety and depression, that could lead to
improved supportive care.
Mindfulness training is increasingly advocated as part of
integrative medical care and has a number of significant
benefits. It is a life skill that can be taught and learned by
anyone, is not expensive, and does not result in adverse side
effects. Newer approaches to teaching mindfulness are being
translated into eHealth and mHealth settings, which means a
greater capacity for dissemination and therefore reach. We
need to make sure that investigations of this type of lifestyle
training are done within the context of well-designed, the-
ory-based scientific trials if we hope to see greater uptake
and incorporation of mindfulness-based approaches into
evidence-based practice for health management.
