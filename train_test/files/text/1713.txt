Osteoporosis, a deterioration of bone tissue
that results in low bone mineral density
(BMD) and risk of fracture [World Health
Organization (WHO) 2003], poses a disease
burden that exceeds that of hypertension and
breast cancer (WHO 2004). The Joint Food
and Agricultural Organization of the United
Nations/WHO Expert Committee on Food
Additives (JECFA) recently concluded that
substantial uncertainty remains regarding the
long-term significance of the effects of cad-
mium on bone (JECFA 2005), citing mixed
results from epidemiologic studies that inves-
tigated the association between low-level
environmental exposure to Cd and its direct
effects on bone.
Cadmium is a toxic metal that is released
into the environment from industrial activity,
including mining and smelting, fuel combus-
tion (e.g., coal-fired power plants), disposal of
metal-containing products, and application of
municipal sludge or phosphate fertilizer
[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry (ATSDR) 1999]. Human exposure to
Cd is primarily through food [International
Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) 1992],
with low levels of Cd found in all foods
(ATSDR 1999). Smokers may have up to
twice the Cd intake compared with non-
smokers because cigarette smoke contains Cd
taken up by the tobacco plant (ATSDR 1999).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
Total Diet Study update reported a 26%
increase in dietary Cd exposure from 1990
through 2003, from 8.81 to 11.06 µg/per-
son/day; the latter exposure constitutes 21% of
the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI)
(Egan et al. 2007).
Cadmium accumulates in the human
body, particularly the kidney, where it can
remain for many years. A small portion of Cd
is slowly excreted in urine (ATSDR 1999).
Urinary Cd (U-Cd) is a biomarker for lifetime
Cd body burden in people with lower expo-
sures because, in the absence of episodes of
high-level exposure, Cd-binding sites are not
saturated, and the urine Cd level increases in
proportion to the amount of Cd stored in the
body [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) 2005; IPCS 1992].
U-Cd has been inversely associated with
forearm BMD in studies from Sweden and
Belgium (Akesson et al. 2006; Alfven et al.
2000; Staessen et al. 1999); however, mixed
results were reported in Japan. Honda et al.
(2003) found that ultrasound-measured stiff-
ness index, an index of calcaneal bone mass,
was significantly inversely correlated with U-
Cd, in the absence of kidney damage, whereas
Horiguchi et al. (2005) reported no associa-
tion between Cd and bone effects after
adjustment for renal effects. Tubular renal
dysfunction has been found at U-Cd levels as
low as 1 µg/g creatinine (Jarup et al. 2000).
Chen et al. (2006) investigated the relation-
ship between U-Cd and 2
-microglobulin-
uria, a biomarker of Cd-induced renal tubular
damage, in a type 2 diabetic population and
showed statistically significant increased odds
of tubular renal dysfunction at U-Cd levels
1 µg/g creatinine relative to U-Cd levels
<1.0 µg/g creatinine. Akesson et al. (2006)
reported associations between increasing over-
all Cd levels and decreasing forearm BMD
and a direct effect on bone, that is, increasing
bone resorption. They did not, however,
compare risks for osteoporosis associated with
specific Cd levels. The Osteoporosis-
Cadmium as a Risk Factor (OSCAR) study
(Jarup and Alfven 2004) identified a dose­
response relationship between U-Cd 3 µg/g
creatinine and higher and low BMD, but
additional studies are needed to clarify the
risk of osteoporosis associated with wide-
spread exposure and U-Cd at levels < 1.0 g/g
creatinine associated with renal tubular dys-
function. Additionally, these studies used
peripheral bone density measures, whereas
the international reference standard is based
on a femoral neck BMD measure (WHO
2004). Moreover, fracture rates vary substan-
tially worldwide (WHO 2004), and there is a
dearth of evidence concerning the association
between Cd and osteoporosis in North
American populations.
Our primary objective was to investigate
the association between U-Cd, particularly at
levels  1.0 µg/g creatinine, and hip BMD at
levels indicative of osteoporosis according to
WHO criterion in a population-based sample
of U.S. women  50 years of age. Our sec-
ondary objective was to investigate the associ-
ations between U-Cd and survey-respondent­
reported physician diagnosis of osteoporosis,
and to compare the results of the two out-
come measures. We hypothesized that higher

BACKGROUND: Urinary cadmium (U-Cd) has been associated with decreased peripheral bone
mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. This association, however, has not been confirmed
using femoral BMD, the international standard for diagnosing osteoporosis, at levels < 1.0 µg
Cd/g creatinine.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to investigate the statistical association between U-Cd, at levels  1 µg/g
creatinine, and osteoporosis, as indicated by hip BMD and self-report in a population-based sample
of U.S. women  50 years of age.
METHODS: We drew data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for
1988­1994 (n = 3,207) and 1999­2004 (n = 1,051). Osteoporosis was indicated by hip BMD cut-
offs based on the international standard and self-report of physician diagnosis. We analyzed U-Cd
levels for association with osteoporosis using multiple logistic regression.
RESULTS: Women  50 years of age with U-Cd levels between 0.50 and 1.00 µg/g creatinine were
at 43% greater risk for hip-BMD­defined osteoporosis, relative to those with levels  0.50 µg/g
(odds ratio = 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.02­2.00; p = 0.04). We observed similar effect esti-
mates using self-report of physician-diagnosed osteoporosis. Smokers did not show a statistically
increased risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that U.S. women are at risk for osteoporosis at U-Cd levels below
the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 3-µg/g safety standard. Given null find-
ings among smokers, dietary Cd, rather than tobacco, is the likely source of Cd-related osteoporosis
risk for the U.S. female population  50 years of age.

levels of U-Cd might be associated with
greater odds for osteoporosis, and that Cd lev-
els between 0.50 and 1.0 µg/g creatinine
might suggest a significant exposure­effect
relationship relative to the reference group
with the lowest Cd levels.
Materials and Methods
We obtained the study sample data sets
from the Third U.S. National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
1988­1994 survey data (CDC 2008) for the
primary analysis of hip BMD, and NHANES
1999­2004 data (CDC 2007a, 2007b, 2007c)
for the secondary analysis of survey-respon-
dent­reported physician diagnosis of osteo-
porosis. NHANES is a cross-sectional, random
household survey of the civilian population
based on a complex probability sampling
design (CDC 2006). NHANES 1988­1994
data sets included two phases of data each
obtained from interviews of 33,994 partici-
pants and examinations of 30,818 participants
(CDC 1996a). BMD measurements were
obtained by bone densitometry, conducted at
the Medical Examination Center and per-
formed on 14,646 men and women  20 years
of age. We limited our analysis to women
 50 years of age because female sex and age of
 50 years are recognized risk factors for osteo-
porosis (Dontas and Yiannakpoulos 2007).
BMD measurements were performed on 3,379
women  50 years of age, with 2% rejected
and 3,311 with acceptable BMD data (Looker
et al. 1997). The female response rate for
BMD examination was 82.43% (Mohadjer
et al. 1994). Overall, the ranges of interviewed
and examined sample response rates for
women  50 years of age were 78­81% and
from 51­73%, respectively, for NHANES III
[National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
2008]. NHANES 1999­2000, 2001­2002,
and 2003­2004 data sets included a total of
31,126 participants (CDC 2007a, 2007b,
2007c). The ranges of female interviewed and
examined response rates for women  50 years
of age were 71­75% and 52­71%, respec-
tively, for NHANES 1999­2000; 72­77%
and 53­74%, respectively, for NHANES
2001­2002; and 67­77% and 57­72%,
respectively, for NHANES 2003­2004
(NCHS 2008). The lowest response rates, that
is, 51­57%, were for examined women
 80 years of age.
For the primary analysis, osteoporosis sta-
tus was indicated by either femur neck BMD
< 0.56 g/cm2 or total hip BMD < 0.64 g/cm2,
per the osteoporosis cutoffs reported in the
NHANES III femoral bone density study
conducted by Looker et al. (1997), and con-
sistent with the international reference stan-
dard (WHO 2004). The international
reference standard is used worldwide to diag-
nose osteoporosis at the hip and is based on a
femoral neck BMD of  2.5 SDs below the
young female adult mean (CDC 2007d). For
the secondary analysis, osteoporosis status was
indicated by survey participant reporting dur-
ing the NHANES interview. The interview
question read, "Has a doctor ever told you
that you had osteoporosis, sometimes called
thin or brittle bones?"
For both primary and secondary analyses,
urinary Cd was obtained from a single urine
specimen collected and measured by the CDC
laboratory using atomic absorption spectrome-
try and reported in nanograms per milliliter.
Urinary creatinine was obtained from the same
urine specimen and measured in milligrams
per deciliter. Quality control procedures call
for urine specimens to be processed, stored,
and shipped to the CDC laboratory for analy-
sis per NCHS quality control protocol (CDC
1996b, 2007e). A creatinine-adjusted U-Cd
measure (micrograms per gram) was generated
by dividing U-Cd (nanograms per milliliter) by
urinary creatinine (milligrams per deciliter).
Analyses were limited to women with CDC
laboratory-measured Cd and creatinine, with
U-Cd levels  20 ng/mL. In an NHANES II
study, Whittemore et al. (1991) used this same
20-ng/mL exclusion, citing the determination
by Friberg et al. (1985) that 20 µg/L (ng/mL)
is considered an upper bound for plausible val-
ues in environmental exposures. As a result, no
observations were excluded in our primary
analysis, and only one observation, with an
extreme creatinine-adjusted Cd level of
282.90 µg/g, was excluded in the secondary
analysis. To facilitate comparisons with the
OSCAR study, which used U-Cd levels of
< 0.50, 0.50 to < 3.00, and  3.00 nmol/mmol
creatinine (Alfven et al. 2000), with
1 nmol/mmol creatinine = 1 µg/g creatinine
(Jarup et al. 2000), we used a reference U-Cd
level of  0.50 µg/g creatinine. However, to
investigate relative effects at lower levels of Cd
(i.e., < 1.0 µg/g creatinine), we used the follow-
ing U-Cd levels: > 0.50­1.00 µg/g creatinine
and > 1.00 µg/g creatinine.
In our primary analysis, 664 women
> 50 years of age had osteoporosis and 2,543
did not; in our secondary analysis, 200 women
in this age group had osteoporosis and 851 did
not. We conducted logistic regression to cal-
culate the urinary creatinine-adjusted Cd odds
ratio (OR) for osteoporosis, both unadjusted
and adjusted for age, race (white compared
with nonwhite), family income category (low-
est to highest), underweight (< 127 lb or
57.61 kg), and smoking status. According to
the National Osteoporosis Foundation's
Physician's Guide to Prevention and Treatment
of Osteoporosis (National Osteoporosis
Foundation 2003), low body weight (e.g.,
~ 127 lb) is a major risk factor for osteoporosis
and related fracture in Caucasian post-
menopausal women. We delineated smoking
status into ever-smokers, who reported having
smoked at least 100 cigarettes and other
tobacco in their lifetime and/or current smok-
ing every day or some days, versus never-
smokers, who responded negatively to both
former and current smoking.
We also adjusted for reported renal impair-
ment in the secondary analysis in an effort to
proxy Cd-induced renal tubular damage that
may indirectly result in low BMD and osteo-
porosis through secondary effects on bone
(Chen et al. 2006; Jarup et al. 2000). A surro-
gate measure was available in the NHANES
1999­2004 survey data sets: We defined
impaired renal function as a "yes" response to
the NHANES survey question, "Have you ever
been told by a doctor or other health profes-
sional that you had weak or failing kidneys?
Do not include kidney stones, bladder infec-
tions, or incontinence." The same question was
not asked in the NHANES III study, nor were
biomarkers of Cd-induced renal tubular dam-
age available, for example, urinary retinol-
binding protein (Jarup et al. 2000; Schutte
et al. 2008) or 2
-microglobulin (Chen et al.
2006). Consequently, the primary analysis did
not adjust for renal impairment.
We also investigated the relationship
between U-Cd and BMD from NHANES III
using multiple linear regression. We conducted
this analysis to compare results using continu-
ous BMD measures with those relying on
BMD cutoffs of osteoporosis (Looker et al.
1997), as are used in multiple logistic regres-
sion analyses.
We conducted statistical analysis for calcu-
lation of ORs using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We used SAS-
callable Sudaan to calculate 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) and p-values (of
Satterwaithe adjusted F-test statistics) for all
statistical analyses, as well as -coefficients and
multiple R2 values for linear regression, per
NHANES analytic guidelines (CDC 1996b,
2006). Also in accordance with NHANES
analytic guidelines for complex survey analysis
of one or more variables from the medical
examination component (MEC) (i.e., U-Cd
and creatinine), we used NHANES III MEC
weights (Looker et al. 1997) and NHANES
6-year MEC weights (CDC 2006). We calcu-
lated 6-year MEC weights for the appropriate
data release years using 4-year MEC weights
and 2-year MEC weights. The convergence
criterion was satisfied for logistic regression
analyses, and global chi-square statistics were
significant, thus providing no indication to
question the validity of model fit. In the linear
regression analyses, we analyzed two dependent
variables in separate regression equations:
femur BMD and total hip BMD. Plots of both
dependent variables approximated normal dis-
tributions; however, plots of creatinine-
adjusted U-Cd did not, so we standardized

Results
Unadjusted findings. The arithmetic mean
U-Cd for U.S. women 50­90 years of age in
the NHANES 1988­1994 sample (with hip
BMD measured) was 0.96, with a maximum
of 16.17 µg/g creatinine. Mean U-Cd was
higher for women with osteoporosis
(1.12 µg/g) than for those without osteoporo-
sis (0.92 µg/g). For a 1-µg/g increase in
U-Cd, a woman had 38% greater odds for
osteoporosis (OR = 1.38; p-value < 0.01),
unadjusted for demographic and health
characteristics. Women with Cd levels
between 0.50 and 1.0 µg/g creatinine had
55% greater odds for osteoporosis compared
with women with levels  0.50 µg/g
(OR = 1.55; p < 0.01; Table 1).
In the NHANES 1999­2004 sample
(with respondent-reported physician diagnosis
of osteoporosis), mean U-Cd for women
50­85 years of age was 0.63 µg/g, with a max-
imum of 4.20 µg/g. Mean U-Cd was higher
for women with osteoporosis (0.69 µg/g) com-
pared with women without osteoporosis
(0.62 µg/g). For a 1-µg/g increase in U-Cd, a
woman had 59% greater odds for osteoporosis,
unadjusted for demographic and health charac-
teristics (OR = 1.59; p = 0.02). Effects at Cd
levels between 0.50 and 1.0 µg/g creatinine
were similar to those in the BMD analysis
(OR = 1.60; p = 0.04; Table 2).
Adjusted findings, multiple logistic regres-
sion. In this statistical analysis, osteoporosis
was the dependent variable and creatinine-
adjusted U-Cd was the primary predictor. For
a 1-µg/g creatinine increase in U-Cd, women
 50 years of age had 15% greater odds for
osteoporosis (OR = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00­1.33;
p = 0.05), as defined by hip BMD, adjusted
for age (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.07­1.11; p <
0.01), white race (OR = 1.35; 95% CI,
0.95­1.92; p = 0.09), income (OR = 1.00;
95% CI, 0.98­1.02; p = 0.80), ever-smoker
(OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 0.85­1.61; p = 0.33),
and underweight (OR = 6.70; 95% CI,
4.48­10.02; p < 0.01). Compared with the
reference group ( 0.50 µg Cd/g creatinine),

p = 0.40), and underweight (OR = 6.85; 95%
CI, 4.52­10.40; p < 0.01; Table 3).
The corresponding OR was similar for
women who reported a diagnosis of osteoporosis
(OR = 1.46), and although statistical signifi-
cance was not evident at Cd levels between 0.50
and 1.00 µg/g for this outcome measure, overall
incremental Cd was significantly associated with
osteoporosis (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.07­2.54;

(OR = 2.89; 95% CI, 1.21­6.87; p = 0.02;
Table 3). Adjusted findings for ever-smokers did
not indicate a statistically significant risk per
1-µg/g creatinine increment in U-Cd, although
a marginally significant risk was evident for
never-smokers in the NHANES 1999­2004
analysis (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 0.99­4.23;
p = 0.05; Table 4).
Adjusted findings, multiple linear regres-
sion. In these statistical analyses, BMD (sepa-
rately for femur and total hip) was the
dependent variable and the natural log of creati-
nine-adjusted U-Cd was the primary predictor.
The natural log of creatinine-adjusted U-Cd
showed statistically significant inverse associa-
tions with femur BMD ( = ­0.04; 95% CI,
­0.06 to ­0.02; p < 0.01) and with total hip
BMD ( = ­0.05; 95% CI, ­0.07 to ­0.03;
p < 0.01). Age, white race, and underweight
were statistically significant covariates for both
outcomes, whereas smoking and income were
not statistically significant (Table 5).
Discussion
In the present study, our findings of statisti-
cally significant associations between Cd
exposure and osteoporosis, and between Cd
and BMD, in the U.S. population are consis-
tent with previously reported studies of popu-
lations in Sweden (Akesson et al. 2006;
Alfven et al. 2000) Belgium (Staessen et al.
1999), and Japan (Honda et al. 2003).
However, an important distinction is that, in
this study of the U.S. female population
 50 years of age, U-Cd was significantly
associated with greater odds for hip-BMD­
defined osteoporosis at levels  1.0 µg/g crea-
tinine. Adjusted Cd levels < 1.00 µg/g were
not significantly associated with respondent-
reported physician-diagnosed osteoporosis in
the NHANES 1999­2004 data set, although
the effect estimates were highly similar
(OR  1.40) across both NHANES data sets.
Osteoporosis prevalence was consistent across
both NHANES data sets at 20%. The smaller
sample size of the NHANES 1999­2004 data
set may have limited our ability to detect sta-
tistical significance of adjusted Cd levels
< 1.00 µg/g for reported osteoporosis.
Findings were consistent with our primary
hypothesis that Cd levels between 0.50 and
1.0 µg/g creatinine are associated with osteo-
porosis, relative to reference group levels of
 0.50 µg/g creatinine. Additionally, osteo-
porosis and BMD were statistically associated
with age and underweight, but not with smok-
ing status or income. Self-reported renal
impairment was statistically associated with
self-reported osteoporosis, as well. We found
evidence of risk of Cd-related osteoporosis at
levels less than half that of the OSCAR study
(Jarup and Alfven 2004). Our ability to detect
risks from lower level exposures reflects that
our population resided in areas of no known
Cd contamination, in contrast to the OSCAR
study population (Jarup and Alfven 2004). In
opposition to our findings, Horiguchi et al.
(2005) reported no association between U-Cd
and BMD in female Japanese farmers. One
possible explanation is selection bias: those
women able to continue to work as farmers
and thus be eligible for Horiguchi et al.'s study
were likely not to have the debilitating effects
of osteoporosis. Another design flaw is the lack
of transparent and objective selection criteria
for designated contaminated and uncontami-
nated populations (Horiguchi et al. 2005).
Our study has several advantages over pre-
vious studies. First, we used decreased hip
BMD measurements based on the WHO

rather than on peripheral measurements.
Second, we found statistically increased osteo-
porosis risk at Cd levels < 1.00 µg Cd/g crea-
tinine in a large, varied sample representative
of a population with widespread exposure.
Finally, we showed similar effects for a subse-
quent population-representative sample
reporting physician-diagnosed osteoporosis in
the NHANES 1999­2004 data set.
The primary and secondary analyses have
complementary strengths and weaknesses. Lack
of confirmation of respondent-reported diag-
nostic findings can be interpreted as a limita-
tion to our analysis of NHANES 1999­2004
data. However, our analysis of NHANES III
BMD-based data may be limited by the lack of
expert consensus on the use of BMD as a diag-
nostic criterion for osteoporosis (CDC 2007d;
National Institutes of Health 2000). Specificity
is limited; that is, a physician cannot defini-
tively rule out osteoporosis at other sites
(Nelson et al. 2002). Moreover, Cummings
et al. (2002) asserted that the relationship
between decreased BMD and increased risk of
fracture is continuous so that a cutoff value to
differentiate high-risk from low-risk individu-
als is problematic. Results of multiple linear
regression analyses that took advantage of con-
tinuous BMD, however, also revealed an
inverse association between BMD and U-Cd,
lending support to the logistic regression analy-
ses of the BMD cutoff value.
Another consideration is that diagnostic
criteria are based on BMD measures and cut-
off values calculated for white women, so they
may underestimate osteoporosis in minorities
(CDC 2007d). Of note, a greater proportion
of white women had hip-BMD­defined
osteoporosis (88%), compared with the pro-
portion of white women with the reported
osteoporosis outcome measure (75%). It is
also interesting that white race was signifi-
cantly associated with decreased BMD using
multiple linear regression but not with BMD-
cutoff­defined osteoporosis using multiple
logistic regression. Notwithstanding the limi-
tations of linear regression for the nonpara-
metric continuous primary predictor Cd, the
discrepancy in significance of the dichotomous
race covariate may suggest limited application
of cutoff values to nonwhites. This possibility
is strengthened by the additional discrepancy
that white race was significantly associated
with increased odds for self-reported osteo-
porosis, but not osteoporosis defined by BMD
cutoff, and merits further research.
In this study we did not address fracture
outcomes; however, it is noteworthy that asso-
ciations between environmental Cd exposure
and fracture risk have been previously reported
in the literature. Staessen et al. (1999) found a
statistically significant association between a
2-fold increase in U-Cd and 73% increased
risk of fractures in women. The OSCAR study
reported evidence of an association between
increasing Cd exposure and excess risk of fore-
arm fractures in people  50 years of age (Jarup
and Alfven 2004). Alfven et al. (2004) found
that the fracture hazard ratio increased by 18%
per 1-nmol Cd/mmol creatinine for this same
age group. Zhu et al. (2004) reported increased
fracture prevalence among people  50 years of
age living in a Cd-polluted area in China com-
pared with residents of a control area.
A biological mechanism for Cd-induced
osteoporosis is uncertain. It has been hypoth-
esized that Cd-induced renal tubular damage
leads to hypercalciuria, which secondarily
causes bone mineral loss (Kjellstrom 1992;
Satarug and Moore 2004). Other possible
mechanisms underlying the effects of Cd on
bone include interference with calcium
absorption from the intestines, disruption of
parathyroid hormone's stimulation of vitamin
D production in renal cells, and diminished
kidney enzymatic action to activate vitamin D
(Kjellstrom 1992). Yet, recent research has
provided evidence of primary effects on bone
(Akesson et al. 2006; Satarug and Moore
2004; Schutte et al. 2008). Akesson et al.
(2006) interpreted findings of a positive asso-
ciation between U-Cd and deoxypyridinoline,
a biomarker of bone resorption, to suggest a
direct effect of Cd on bone in a Swedish pop-
ulation-based study of women. A Belgian
population-based analysis of women without
renal tubular dysfunction, as measured by the
biomarker urinary retinol-binding protein,
showed a positive association between U-Cd
and two biomarkers of bone resorption, uri-
nary hydroxylysylpyridinoline and lysylpyridi-
noline (Schutte et al. 2008).
A limitation of this study was our inability
to adjust for biomarkers of renal tubular
impairment in the primary analysis and to
precisely adjust for Cd-induced tubular kidney
damage in the secondary analysis, in which
participant-reported physician diagnosis of
kidney disease provided a weak surrogate rela-
tive to tubular dysfunction biomarkers such as
retinol-binding protein (Schutte et al. 2008)
and 2
-microglobulin (Chen et al. 2006).
Consequently, our analysis did not provide
evidence to support conclusions regarding the
effects of Cd on osteoporosis independent of
renal tubular dysfunction. However, our find-
ings of increased odds for osteoporosis at Cd
levels below those previously associated with
renal tubular dysfunction indicate the possibil-
ity of a direct effect. Moreover, Schutte et al.
(2008) reported findings of direct effects of
Cd on bone, independent of renal tubular dys-
function biomarkers. Further work is needed
to understand the independent effects of Cd
on osteoporosis and renal tubular dysfunction.
An additional limitation of our study was
the potential for selection bias. NHANES
conducts household surveys and does not
include the institutionalized U.S. population.
Colon-Emeric et al. (2007) estimated the
prevalence of osteoporosis among nursing
home residents at 50% of males and 64­90%
of females. Because of missing data for this
institutionalized elderly population, our find-
ings omit measures of association between Cd
and osteoporosis for this high-risk subpopula-
tion. Moreover, NHANES III­examined
sample response rates were lowest for women
 80 years of age, so again, the frail elderly
population may be underrepresented.
Another limitation of this study is that Cd
measurements were based on a single urine
sample that does not capture possible signifi-
cant temporal variations in U-Cd levels
among NHANES participants. We adjusted
U-Cd for urinary creatinine in an attempt to
correct for varying concentrations among
samples collected from different individuals at
different times. Specific gravity has also been
recommended for such an adjustment
(Suwazono et al. 2005), but this variable was
not available in NHANES. Although U-Cd
adjusted for creatinine may be affected by age,
gender, and body size (Suwazono et al. 2005),
we controlled for these influences, and adjust-
ment for creatinine is commonly used, allow-
ing comparisons among a number of studies.
Other limitations are lack of inclusion of
other factors that may be associated with the
risk of osteoporosis, such as menopause, hor-
mone replacement therapy, adult calcium or
vitamin D intake, excessive alcohol intake,
and personal or family history of fracture.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that U.S. women
are at risk for osteoporosis at U-Cd levels
below the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration's (OSHA) minimum
safety standard of 3 µg/g (OSHA 2005) and
even at levels < 1 µg/g, a concentration not
associated with renal tubular damage. The
cross-sectional design of NHANES limits
determinations of causal associations, and we
did not address the onset of osteoporosis in this
study. U-Cd is a biomarker of long-term Cd
exposure, however, and a temporal sequence
between Cd exposure and osteoporosis is plau-
sible. This national sample allows calculation
of an attributable fraction for the entire popu-
lation. Given that 73% of U.S. women
 50 years of age are estimated to have Cd
body burdens that are associated with excess
risk (> 0.50 µg/g creatinine), as estimated from
the NHANES III data set, these results suggest
that 21% of osteoporosis prevalence among
women  50 years of age may be attributable
to Cd. Because these effects have been
observed at current U.S. dietary exposures that
constitute only 21% of PTWI for Cd (Egan
et al. 2007), there is a need to investigate the
