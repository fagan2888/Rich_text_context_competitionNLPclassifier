DEVELOPMENTAL research demonstrates that author-
itative parenting predicts many positive outcomes for
children and adolescents when compared with authoritarian,
indulgent, and uninvolved parenting (Coplan, Hastings,
Lagace-Seguin, & Moulton, 2002; Steinberg, 2001). Author-
itative parenting, characterized by moderate to high levels of
control along with high levels of support, is related to greater
psychological well-being and lower levels of depressive
symptoms and substance use (Maccoby & Martin, 1983).
Given current efforts to enhance adult well-being in later life
and lifespan development theories that stress the influence of
early childhood experiences well beyond adolescence (El-
der, 1998), the link between early remembered parenting
behavior and adjustment in middle and late adulthood is
worthy of examination.Yet, little is known about the connec-
tion between parenting styles experienced in childhood and
psychological and behavioral outcomes in adulthood.
The present study advances previous work by (a) assess-
ing the association between remembered parenting styles
and multiple indicators of mid- to later-life adjustment; (b)
utilizing the four established parenting styles from the child
development literature, instead of only focusing on one di-
mension of parenting (i.e., support or control) and its con-
nection to a single outcome; (c) examining a large
community sample of adults; and (d) identifying sex, race,
and childhood socioeconomic status (SES) differences in
the link between earlier remembered parenting behavior
and later psychological and behavioral functioning.
Links Between Development and Parental
Support and Control
Most theories of family socialization view parenting be-
havior as multidimensional, involving primarily the domains
of parental support and control (Baumrind, 1971; Maccoby &
Martin, 1983), which are both considered critical to children's
development. Parental support is important because it predicts
a strong sense of self-worth and security, greater psychologi-
cal well-being, and other positive outcomes (Coplan et al.,
2002; Steinberg, 2001). Without adequate parental support,
children are likely to experience anxiety, insecurity, aggres-
sion, hostility, low self-esteem, and inadequacy (Baumrind).
Parental control helps to shape responsible conformity
and self-control in children. The rules and guidelines parents
set and enforce teach children about group and societal stan-
dards for behavior (Baumrind, 1996). Over time, children's
experience with rules and the consequences for breaking
them help them to develop independent decision-making
skills and to internalize control of their own behavior (Baum-
rind). Inadequate parental control, on the other hand, may
make it difficult for children to manage effectively in the out-
side world where behavioral rules and standards of conduct

Background. Authoritative parenting is the parenting style often associated with positive outcomes for children and
adolescents. This study considers whether remembered parenting styles in childhood predict multiple dimensions of
functioning in adulthood.
Methods. We used the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States data set (N = 2,232) to assess the
association between parenting behaviors remembered from childhood--classified as authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and
uninvolved--and psychological well-being, depressive symptoms, and substance abuse, in a subsample of mid- and later-life
adults. Differences in outcomes by sex, race, and childhood socioeconomic status were also examined across parenting styles.
Results. Adults who remembered authoritative compared with authoritarian and uninvolved parents reported greater
psychological well-being and fewer depressive symptoms, and those with uninvolved parents noted greater substance
abuse. No outcome differences were found between remembered authoritative and indulgent parenting styles. A few sex
and race interactions were identified: Authoritative parenting (compared with uninvolved) was more strongly associated
with men's psychological well-being than women's, and authoritative parenting (compared with authoritarian) predicted
reduced depressive symptoms for Whites more than non-Whites.
Conclusions. There is some support that remembered parenting styles continue to be related to functioning across the
lifespan. There is also evidence of resiliency, flexibility, and malleability in human development.

exist in nearly all social settings (Barber & Olsen, 1997). In
combination, therefore, parental support and control are be-
lieved to foster children's emotional, psychological, and be-
havioral well-being and development.
Based on a cross-classification of high and low levels of
parental support and control, child development scholars have
developed typologies of parenting styles. Consistent with the
work of Maccoby and Martin (1983), we distinguish among
four "styles of parenting" based on the balance between high
and low levels of parental responsiveness (i.e., support) and
demandingness (i.e., control). Authoritative parents display
high levels of both responsiveness and demandingness. They
are warm, nurturing, and sensitive to their child's needs and
consistently consider the child's age and maturity when form-
ing behavioral expectations. Authoritarian parents display
low responsiveness and high demandingness. They are often
cold, unsupportive, insensitive to the child's needs, and de-
manding in their control. Indulgent parents use high respon-
siveness but low demandingness; they believe that fewer rules
and expectations for appropriate behavior benefit children's
development. Finally, uninvolved parents display low levels
of both responsiveness and demandingness. They generally
fail to connect with their child, are emotionally detached and
withdrawn, and have few rules and expectations. Rather than
the child-centered motivations that characterize indulgent
parenting, the reasons behind uninvolved parenting tend to be
related to parental psychopathology or other problems.
Developmentalists have empirically validated the impor-
tance of parenting style for numerous child and adolescent
outcomes. (This literature is briefly summarized subse-
quently.) Yet, despite life course theorizing that early life
experiences can have a protracted influence on later devel-
opment (Elder, 1998), no attempts have been made to link
early parenting styles to developmental outcomes in mid-
and later adulthood. Parental support during childhood is
known to predict psychological well-being, self-worth, and
personal control in young adults (Wickrama, Lorenz, &
Conger, 1997). Further, adults reporting positive interac-
tions with parents during childhood are more likely to enter
into social relationships that are supportive, foster well-
being, and contribute to better health and less depression
(Shaw, Krause, Chatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton,
2004). Hence, an empirical foundation exists for testing a
wider array of long-term outcomes that may emerge from
different styles of early parenting.
Evidence of the Importance of Parenting Styles
for Children and Adolescents
Consistent with theoretical expectations, empirical work
indicates that authoritative parenting is generally associated
with the most beneficial child and adolescent outcomes
when compared with nonauthoritative parenting styles
(Coplan et al., 2002; Steinberg, 2001). Children and
adolescents reared by authoritative parents compared with
nonauthoritative parents report better developmental out-
comes, including greater self-esteem, self-control, moral
development, social maturity, and school performance
(Radziszewska, Richardson, Dent, & Flay, 1996), as well as
greater psychological well-being and less depression and
substance use (Shah & Waller, 2000).
Demographic Differences in Parenting Styles and Outcomes
Researchers have raised two important questions regard-
ing variations in parenting styles as they relate to subgroup
differences: First, do preferred parenting styles vary across
racial/ethnic and social class groups and are different parent-
ing styles used with males versus females? Second, do the
effects of various parenting styles differ across these groups?
To address these questions as they relate to adult develop-
ment, our study examines sex, race, and childhood SES dif-
ferences in the relationship between remembered parenting
style and psychological well-being, depressive symptoms,
and substance abuse in mid- and later-life adults.
Studies of children and adolescents indicate that pre-
ferred parenting styles may differ somewhat based on par-
ents' race/ethnicity and SES. Authoritative parenting tends
to be more common among Whites and authoritarian par-
enting more typical of Blacks and Hispanics (Radziszewska
et al., 1996). Interestingly, Asian Americans are said to be
more permissive when children are very young but to shift
toward more authoritarian parenting as they reach "the age
of understanding" (Garcia Coll & Pachter, 2002, p. 198).
SES differences may be confounded with some of the find-
ings attributed to race/ethnicity (Kelley, Power, & Wimbush,
1992). Several studies of Black parents use low-income sam-
ples, which are generally more authoritarian than high-income
ones (Radziszewska et al., 1996). Further, many studies not-
ing a dominant pattern of authoritative parenting among
Whites use middle-class samples, calling into question their
applicability to more diverse samples (Bornstein & Bornstein,
2007). Specifically, high- versus low-SES parents are more
likely to use warmth, stimulation, explanations, and praise
with their children and to focus on children's internal charac-
teristics (e.g., autonomy). Conversely, low-SES parents gen-
erally focus more on children's external behaviors (e.g.,
obedience) (Hoff, Laursen, & Tardif, 2002).
In terms of race/ethnic variations in parenting style out-
comes, much research has addressed the conditions under
which authoritarian parenting may be more desirable than,
and even preferred over, authoritative parenting. A point of-
ten made is that authoritarian parenting styles used by low-
income minority parents living in high-risk environments
may actually benefit children's safety and development and
promote school achievement (Baldwin, Baldwin, & Cole,
1990). Finkelstein, Donenberg, and Martinovich (2001) also
found that Black adolescent girls whose mothers used high
control reported fewer depressive symptoms than Latino
and White girls. Thus, for some populations, authoritarian
PARENTING STYLES AND ADULT ADJUSTMENT 139
rather than authoritative parenting may be more advanta-
geous for child and adolescent outcomes.
Findings on sex differences in child and adolescent out-
comes as they relate to parenting style are inconsistent; some
studies report interactions (Hart, Newell, & Olsen, 2002), and
others note that parenting styles have similar effects for both
sexes (Finkelstein et al., 2001). When differences are noted,
patterns are consistent with the behavior problems typical of
each sex. Girls tend to exhibit more internal problems (e.g.,
shyness, somatic complaints), whereas boys' problems tend
to be displayed through external behaviors enacted against
others or their environment (Hart et al., 2002). Thus, less than
ideal parenting appears to exacerbate problems in the behav-
ioral domains in which each sex is already at risk.
Early Parenting Behavior and Outcomes in
Adulthood
Investigations of parenting behavior experienced in child-
hood and subsequent adult development are often limited to
parental discipline and considered in association with a
single negative outcome, such as personality disorders,
depressive symptoms, or substance abuse (Carter, Joyce,
Mulder, & Luty, 2001; Sakado, Kuwabara, Sato, Uehara,
Sakado, & Someya, 2000). For instance, adults who recalled
overcontrolling parents that used negative discipline re-
ported greater anxiety in adulthood (Gerlsma, Emmelkamp,
& Arrindell, 1990). Parents' use of either excessive or inad-
equate control also predicted increased depressive symp-
toms in adulthood (Sakado et al., 2000).
Limited work has examined the relationship between
adult outcomes and recalled parenting styles that encom-
pass both parental support and control. Moreover, studies
generally include a single negative outcome and frequently
are limited to clinical samples. Using a sample of clinic out-
patients along with a healthy community sample, Shah and
Waller (2000) considered the risk of depressive symptoms
as they related to both remembered parental care (e.g.,
warmth) and overprotection (e.g., control). Depressed adults
were more likely than healthy ones to recall their parents as
uncaring and overprotective. Further, greater parental care
rather than less overprotection was associated with lower
vulnerability for depressive symptoms.
Carter et al. (2001) investigated the link between remem-
bered parental care and overprotection and later personality
dysfunction in depressed outpatients. They found that recollec-
tions of low parental care predicted uncooperativeness, use of
immature defenses, and more symptoms of personality disor-
der compared with parental overprotection. Parker, Boak,
Griffin, Ripple, and Peay (1999) also observed that patients in
their study (most of whom were depressed) who recalled their
parentsashighlyindifferent(lowcare)andovercontrollingwere
more likely to be diagnosed with personality disorders, anxiety,
depressive symptoms, and self-defeating behavior problems. In
contrast, patients recalling more optimal parenting--defined as
high affection and balanced levels of control--were least likely
to be diagnosed with any of these dysfunctions.
McCrae and Costa (1988) further found that adults who
recalled high parental support were less likely to report neu-
roticism and scored high on extraversion, agreeableness,
and openness to new experiences. Additionally, adults who
recalled demanding parents were more conventional, con-
scientious, and assertive. Finally, adults who remembered
more indulgent parents developed into confident but self-
centered adults. These authors caution, however, that effect
sizes for these findings were small, and thus parenting expe-
rienced in childhood may have a limited effect on adult per-
sonality. Instead, they posit that environmental contexts,
genetic factors, and social processes might interact and in-
fluence personality in adulthood.
Given this literature, the current study employs the four
parenting styles widely used in the child literature based on
a combination of high and low levels of support and control
to consider the association between parenting styles and
multiple dimensions of functioning in mid- and later-life
adults. The following hypothesis is tested: Adults who re-
member parenting behaviors classified as authoritative re-
port greater psychological well-being, fewer depressive
symptoms, and less substance abuse than adults who re-
member parenting behaviors categorized as authoritarian,
uninvolved, or indulgent. We also ask whether sex, race, and
childhood SES moderate the connection between remem-
bered parenting styles and psychological well-being, depres-
sivesymptoms,andsubstanceabuse,controllingforvariables
that are known to be associated with adult functioning.
Methods
Data
The analyses used secondary data from the 1995 Na-
tional Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS), which was designed to assess psychological
well-being, physical health, and social responsibility in
midlife. Using random digit dialing, MIDUS data were
collected via 40-minute telephone interviews (response
rate 70%) followed by self-administered mail-back ques-
tionnaires (response rate 87%). The sample was limited to
English-speaking, noninstitutionalized adults between the
ages of 25 and 74 years (N = 4,244).
Sample
Given our focus on the link between psychological and
behavioral functioning and childhood parenting styles for
middle-aged and older adults, we limited the analytic sam-
ple to respondents aged 40 and older. This included 1,138
men and 1,094 women who completed both the phone inter-
view and relevant sections of the self-administered ques-
tionnaire. The mean age of the respondents was 54 years
(SD = 9.51). The majority (89%) of respondents were
ROTHRAUFF ET AL.
140
non-Hispanic White, and most (66%) were married (19%
separated/divorced, 9% widowed, and 6% never married).
Regarding their level of education, 10% had less than a high
school degree, 50% had a high school degree or GED, 27%
had either a 2- or 4-year college degree, and 13% had a mas-
ter's degree or higher. Reported annual incomes were highly
variable--43% earned <$15,000, 7% earned >$75,000, and
the modal (21%) income category was $30,000­$49,999.
Independent Variables
Remembered parenting styles from childhood.--Four par-
enting style categories were developed based on the parent-
ing dimensions of responsiveness and demandingness, as
laid out by Maccoby and Martin (1983). (These two distinct
dimensions of parenting were confirmed by a factor analysis
conducted on the nine parenting items described subse-
quently.) First, we constructed the parental support and con-
trol scales separately for mothers and fathers. The support
scale included six items, referring to the years the respondent
was growing up, "How much did your mother/father under-
stand your problems and worries? How much could you con-
fide in her/him about things that were bothering you? How
much love and affection did she/he give you? How much
time and attention did she/he give you when you needed it?
How much effort did she/he put into watching over you and
making sure you had a good upbringing? How much did she/
he teach you about life?" Responses ranged from 1 = a lot to
4 = not at all. Items were reverse coded so that higher scores
indicate greater parental support. The remembered parental
support scale was created by calculating the mean across the
six items, similar to the approach used by other researchers
(Ryff, Singer, & Palmersheim, 2004). For households with
two parents, the mean was calculated across the maternal
and paternal support scale (alpha was .91), consistent with
the extensive work of Steinberg, Lamborn, Darling, Mounts,
and Dornbusch (1994) on parenting styles.
The parental control scale consisted of three items that
asked about mother and father separately: "How strict was
she/he with her/his rules for you? How consistent was she/
he about the rules? How much did she/he stop you from do-
ing things that other kids your age were allowed to do?"
Responses ranged from 1 = a lot to 4 = not at all. Again,
items were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate
greater parental control, and the scale was created by calcu-
lating the mean across the three items (Ryff et al., 2004). For
households with two parents, the mean was calculated across
the maternal and paternal control scales (alpha was .79).
Next, we used the median split on the two parenting di-
mension scales to establish low and high levels of support
and low and high levels of control. Finally, we developed
four parenting style categories based on distinct combina-
tions of the levels of parental support and control: high
support and high control parenting were classified as
authoritative (29%), low support and high control were
classified as authoritarian (19%), high support and low con-
trol were categorized as indulgent (21%), and low support
and low control were classified as uninvolved (31%).
Based on other categorization approaches used in the
child development literature, we also ran the analyses using
a tertile split (Steinberg et al., 1994). That is, we divided the
support and control scales into low, medium, and high levels
of support and control. Then, only the upper and lower ter-
tiles were used to create the four parenting styles, and re-
spondents falling into the medium tertiles (nearly 50%) were
deleted from the analyses. This resulted in a sample of 1,118
adults. The tertile split is often used in child studies because
it assures four very distinct parenting styles (Steinberg et al).
Authoritative parenting included respondents in the highest
tertiles on both support and control, authoritarian parenting
included those scoring in the lowest tertile on support and
highest tertile on control, uninvolved parenting included
those scoring in the lowest tertiles on both support and con-
trol, and indulgent parenting included those scoring in the
highest tertile on support and lowest tertile on control. Re-
sults based on this classification scheme were similar to
those obtained using the median split. One exception was
that adults who remembered uninvolved parents reported
greater anxiety compared with adults who remembered au-
thoritative parents using the median split but not the tertile
split. To maintain the more complete sample and increase
generalizability of the findings and power, we chose to re-
port the results obtained using the median split approach.
Dependent Variables
Psychological well-being.--Psychological well-being
was measured using a mean composite score of the six di-
mensions of Ryff's (1989) shortened psychological well-
being scale, consistent with the approach used by other
researchers (e.g., Marmot & Fuhrer, 2004). The use of a
composite score also reflects our interest in "overall" psy-
chological well-being rather than particular subscales of
well-being. Each scale consisted of three items: (a) positive
relations with others (e.g., "I have not experienced many
warm and trusting relationships with others"), (b) self-ac-
ceptance (e.g., "I like most parts of my personality"), (c)
autonomy (e.g., "I tend to be influenced by people with
strong opinions"), (d) personal growth (e.g., "For me, life
has been a continuous process of learning, changing, and
growth"), (e) environmental mastery (e.g., "In general, I
feel I am in charge of the situation in which I live"), and (f)
purpose in life (e.g., "Some people wander aimlessly
through life, but I am not one of them"). Responses ranged
from 1 = strongly agree to 7 = strongly disagree. Mean im-
putation was used to calculate the sum score when an item
was missing. Items were reverse coded so that higher scores
indicate greater psychological well-being (alpha was .76).
PARENTING STYLES AND ADULT ADJUSTMENT 141
Depressive symptoms.--Depressive symptoms were as-
sessed by summing responses to seven yes/no questions
regarding depressed mood, energy, appetite, sleep, concen-
tration, feeling down, and suicidal thoughts (e.g., "During
two weeks in the past 12 months, when you felt sad, blue,
or depressed, did you lose interest in most things?"). Higher
values indicate more depressive symptoms (alpha was .53).
Depressive symptoms were assessed with the World Health
Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view Short Form, which has shown good test­retest reli-
ability and clinical validity (Kessler, Andrews, Mroczek,
Ustun, & Wittchen, 1998).
Substance abuse.--First, alcohol abuse was assessed via
yes/no responses to five alcohol abuse screening items (e.g.,
"Did you ever, during the past 12 months, have such strong
desire or urge to use alcohol that you could not resist it or
could not think of anything else?"). Second, illegal drug
abuse was assessed via yes/no responses to five drug use
screening items (e.g., "Did you ever, during the past 12
months, have any emotional or psychological problems
from using these [illegal] substances?"). The substance
abuse scale was created by adding the number of yes
responses to the alcohol and drug abuse questions (alpha
was .76).
Control Variables
Age, marital status, education, and income were used as
control variables in the analyses because past work reports
differences in psychological and behavioral functioning
based on these variables. Older adults, married persons, and
those with higher education and income tend to exhibit
greater psychological and behavioral functioning (Brown,
Bulanda, & Lee, 2005; Rieker & Bird, 2005; Savla,Almeida,
Davey, & Zarit, 2008).A dummy variable, "unmarried," was
created for marital status with 0=currently married (66%)
and 1=not currently married (34%); age, education, and in-
come were used as continuous variables. We used a mean
imputation for missing income values (6%); results did not
differ when using the imputed variable compared with anal-
yses where cases with missing values were omitted.
Moderator Variables
Analyses also tested the effects of sex, race, and child-
hood SES, along with their interaction with parenting style
as predictors of adult functioning. Sex was coded 0­1, with
1 representing women. Race was coded 0­1 with 1 repre-
senting non-Whites. Childhood SES would ideally be based
on parents' education, income, and/or occupation. How-
ever, in the MIDUS data, we were limited to a single item
asking, "When you were growing up, were you better off or
worse off financially than the average family was at that
time?" (1=a lot better off, 7=a lot worse off). This item
was reverse coded to indicate higher childhood SES level.
Data Analyses
To test our hypothesis and answer our research question,
we conducted separate hierarchical multiple regressions for
psychological well-being (Table 1), depressive symptoms
(Table 2), and substance abuse (Table 3). For all dependent
variables, we included as control variables in Model 1: age,
marital status (unmarried), education, and income. These
factors are not central to our findings so we do not discuss
findings from Model 1 in the results. In Model 2, we added
the parenting styles to test our hypothesis. To evaluate
whether sex (women), race (non-White), and childhood
SES moderate the relationship between parenting styles and
the dependent variables, we first added the main effects in
Model 3 and then the nine interaction terms in Model 4 (i.e.,
sex by the three dummy-coded parenting styles, race by the
three dummy-coded parenting styles, and childhood SES by
the three dummy-coded parenting styles). Given that the
large number of interactions in Model 4 may limit statistical
power, we ran each moderating variable in separate models
as well as together. Because there were no differences in the
results, we present the findings for all interactions together
in Model 4.
Results
Psychological Well-Being
Model 2 in Table 1 shows that adults who remembered
authoritarian or uninvolved parenting as children reported
lower psychological well-being compared with adults who
recalled their parents being authoritative. There were no dif-
ferences in well-being between those who had indulgent
compared with authoritative parents. Model 4 in Table 1 in-
dicates that sex was the only variable that moderated the
relationship between well-being and remembered parenting
style with regard to uninvolved versus authoritative parent-
ing. Post hoc analysis indicated that although men and
women recalling uninvolved parents did not differ in well-
being, the benefits of authoritative parenting for well-being
were significantly greater for men than women.
Depressive Symptoms
Model 2 in Table 2 indicates that adults who remem-
bered authoritarian or uninvolved parents reported more
depressive symptoms than did adults who remembered au-
thoritative parents. There was no difference in depressive
symptoms between respondents remembering indulgent
compared with authoritative parents. Model 4 in Table 2
indicates that only race moderated the relationship between
depressive symptoms and parenting style with regard to the
authoritarian versus authoritative parenting groups. Post
hoc analysis indicated no race differences among respon-
dents remembering authoritative parenting, yet among
those who remembered authoritarian parenting Whites re-
ported more depressive symptoms than did non-Whites.
ROTHRAUFF ET AL.
142
Therefore, compared with authoritative parenting, authori-
tarian parenting appears to contribute to more depressive
symptoms for Whites but not non-Whites.
Substance Abuse
Model 2 in Table 3 shows that adults who remembered
uninvolved parents reported more substance abuse compared
with those who remembered authoritative parents. There
were no differences in substance abuse for adults in either
the authoritarian or the indulgent parenting group compared
with those in the authoritative parenting group. Model 4 in
Table 3 shows that neither sex, nor race, nor childhood SES
moderates the relationship between substance abuse and any
of the parenting styles.
Discussion
Ample evidence shows that authoritative parenting predicts
more positive outcomes for children and adolescents than
other types of parenting styles (Coplan et al., 2002; Steinberg,
2001). This study advances that body of work by assessing
whether established parenting styles from childhood--
authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved--as
remembered by adults, predict psychological well-being,
depressive symptoms, and substance abuse in midlife and
beyond. We also tested whether sex, race/ethnicity, and child-
hood SES moderate the association between remembered
parenting styles and the multiple dimensions of adult func-
tioning. Our findings add to the literature on parenting styles
in childhood and functioning in mid- to later life by providing
evidence that remembered authoritative parenting is linked
with more positive adult outcomes compared with recalled
authoritarian and uninvolved parenting behaviors. However,
in only two situations did sex and race act as moderators.
Remembered Parenting Styles and Adult Functioning
We found some support for our hypothesis that adults who
remember parenting behaviors classified as authoritative
report greater psychological well-being, fewer depressive
symptoms, and less substance abuse than adults who remem-
ber parenting behaviors categorized as authoritarian, unin-
volved, or indulgent. There were significant effects of
parenting style for psychological well-being and depressive
symptoms, but only regarding authoritarian and uninvolved
parenting compared with authoritative parenting.As expected,
adults who remembered more authoritarian or uninvolved
parenting reported lower psychological well-being and more
depressive symptoms than those remembering authoritative
parenting in childhood. Additionally, adults recalling unin-
volved parenting in childhood rather than authoritative par-
enting reported greater substance abuse. These findings,
which are consistent with the child development literature
and studies of adults (Parker et al., 1999; Shah & Waller,
2000; Steinberg et al., 1994), support principles of the life
course perspective (Elder, 1998) by suggesting that positive

PARENTING STYLES AND ADULT ADJUSTMENT 143
outcomes associated with authoritative parenting in child-
hood can extend into adulthood--at least as they relate to
remembered parenting styles--and merit continued investi-
gation.
Our finding that parenting style was less influential in
adults' reports of substance abuse than psychological well-
being and depression was unexpected but may reflect the
lifespan development notion that human development is re-
markably plastic and shaped by a diverse set of influences
(Baltes, 1987). The life course perspective also suggests
that life experiences may provide opportunities for change
that can redirect trajectories such that positive functioning
in adulthood can be achieved even if early experiences are
less than ideal (Elder, 1998). For instance, as persons move
into adulthood, their range of experiences and exposure to
nonparental socializing agents expands dramatically. These
new situations provide alternative influences that may con-
tribute to development, thereby reducing the link between
early parenting and diverse outcomes. For persons experi-
encing nonoptimal parenting early in life and problems in
childhood and adolescence, formation of positive relation-
ships and introduction to stable socializing experiences as
adults can be major turning points (Uggen & Massoglia,
2003).
The fact that we found fewer significant parenting style
differences in relation to substance abuse than to our other
outcomes could also be due to the MIDUS sampling frame.
MIDUS used a community sample that excluded institu-
tionalized adults. Given the link between criminal behavior
and alcohol and drug abuse (Goode, 2007), the heaviest
drinkers and drug abusers may be more involved in crime
and other negative behaviors that remove them from the
general population and thus our sample. Adults not in-
cluded in the MIDUS survey may have selected themselves
out through illegal behavior and imprisonment or institu-
tionalization for mental health problems. Selection bias
may have reduced our ability to reveal significant associa-
tions.
In addition, and contrary to our expectations, there were
no outcome differences between adults who remembered
authoritative parents and those who remembered indulgent
parents. This is also inconsistent with findings that children
and adolescents whose parents are considered indulgent
versus authoritative have less positive outcomes (Steinberg,
2001). One possibility is that high levels of support provide
a buffer for future negative outcomes, even in cases where
children lack firm parental discipline. For example, children
whose parents are supportive share values similar to their
parents and are more open to parental influence (Steinberg,
2008). Thus, even if parents are supportive but lack control,
their children's long-term behavior may not be a problem
because over time they may model their supportive parents'
behavior and adopt prosocial ways. Additionally, as they
mature, children may benefit from nonfamilial environ-
ments that provide or require discipline and control, such
as school and jobs. Thus, even children who lack early

accord with the expectations of nonfamilial settings.
Moderators Between Parenting Styles and Adult
Functioning
We also tested whether sex, race/ethnicity, and childhood
SES moderate the relationship between the four parenting
styles and psychological well-being, depressive symptoms,
and substance abuse. No clear and overarching patterns were
found. Both sex and race revealed one significant interac-
tion, but none were found for childhood SES. Comparisons
between adults recalling authoritative versus nonauthoritative
parents indicated that authoritative behaviors are predictive
of enhanced psychological well-being and fewer depressive
symptoms. These benefits, however, were limited to partic-
ular subgroups of the adult population. Authoritative par-
enting appears to benefit men more than women, but only in
terms of greater psychological well-being, and authoritative
parenting benefits Whites more than non-Whites regarding
reduced depressive symptoms.
Similar to our findings, sex and race differences in the child
development literature are ambiguous in terms of parenting
styles and outcomes (Hart et al., 2002). Some researchers note
sex and race differences in outcomes based on parenting styles
(e.g., Hart et al.), whereas others report limited or no sex and
race differences (Finkelstein et al., 2001). Regarding the lack
of race differences in our study, it should be noted that the vast
majority of participants were non-HispanicWhite, which may
have masked finer group differences. Studies with larger num-
bers of racial and ethnic groups may increase the statistical
power to detect significant differences in adult functioning.
Moreover, the lack of a moderating effect for childhood SES
may be related to our measure. MIDUS included few ques-
tions regarding respondents' parents, especially pertaining to
information from childhood. A more comprehensive measure
that includes parents' education, income, and financial status
from childhood may reveal differences in the link between
adult functioning and remembered parenting styles.
Another limitation of our study is the retrospective ac-
counts of parental behavior in childhood. The validity of
childhood memories is often called into question because
respondents' present status (e.g., psychological well-being)
may shape childhood memories (e.g., Halverson, 1988).
However, we do not attempt to treat our retrospective data as
a proxy for longitudinal data or as a means for establishing
causality. Henry, Moffitt, Caspi, Langley, & Silva (1995)
also noted that retrospective measures "may constitute valid
indicators of the individual's current perception of those fea-
tures [of interest to social scientists], and as such, may be
useful in understanding psychological development or ad-
justment" (p. 93). In addition, some evidence suggests that
concerns about retrospective childhood data are exaggerated
(Brewin, Andrews, & Gotlib, 1993). McCrae and Costa
(1988) found strong concordance in reports of recalled par-
enting styles in childhood between siblings, which provides
some evidence of the accuracy of retrospective accounts of
parenting styles.

PARENTING STYLES AND ADULT ADJUSTMENT 145
Our sole reliance on adults' reports of their parents' be-
havior during childhood also poses a limitation. However,
Block (1971) showed a strong correlation between retro-
spective accounts of childhood experiences and objective
assessments by mothers that were taken in childhood.
Schwartz, Barton-Henry, and Pruzinsky (1985) also found
adolescents' reports of parental behavior to be more accu-
rate than those of parents. Another limitation is that our de-
cision to use the framework of Maccoby and Martin (1983)
for identifying parenting typologies begs the question of
whether our results would be similar using the approach of
Baumrind (1971) to defining parenting styles. Specifically,
Baumrind used both psychological control and behavioral
control to distinguish authoritarian parents from other parents.
Our data, unfortunately, did not address psychological
control, which prevented us from using Baumrind's typology.
Future researchers should consider various approaches to
developing parenting typologies to investigate the relation-
ship between remembered parenting styles and diverse psy-
chological and behavioral outcomes in adulthood.
Despite these limitations, this study is the first to investigate
the link between four typologies of remembered parenting
styles from childhood and psychological and behavioral func-
tioning in mid- to late adulthood. Despite generally small effect
sizes, our results provide some support that remembered par-
enting styles are related to adult functioning, which supports
findings in the child development literature and adult literature
based on clinical samples and single outcomes. In addition, our
findings seem to suggest that human development is character-
ized by resiliency, flexibility, and malleability, at least for com-
munity dwelling adults. It may be that some adults, at least
those living in community settings, are able to rise above nega-
tive influences in childhood by seeking out or attracting envi-
ronments, opportunities, and relationships that promote adult
functioning. More research is clearly warranted in this area to
gain a better understanding of factors (both current and retro-
spective) that enhance positive adult development.
