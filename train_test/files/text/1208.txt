Projected Use of Long-Term-Care Services
by Enrolled Veterans

Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the
projected use for long-term-care services through
2012. Design and Methods: We constructed a stat-
ic-component projection model using age, function,
and other covariates. We obtained enrollee projec-
tions from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
and combined these with nursing home and commu-
nity long-term-care service use rates from the 1999
National Long-Term Care Survey and the 2000
National Health Interview Survey. Results: Over
the next decade, the number of oldest veterans
(aged 85þ) will double, and VHA-enrolled veterans
aged 85 and older will increase sevenfold. This will
result in a 20­25% increase in use for both nursing
home and home- and community-based services.
VHA currently concentrates 90% of its long-term-
care resources on nursing home care. However,
among those who receive long-term care from all
formal sources, 56% receive care in the community.
Age and marital status are significant predictors of
use of either type of formal long-term-care service for
any given level of disability. VHA's experience with
the mandatory nursing home benefit suggests that
even when the cost to the veteran is near zero, only
60­65% of eligibles will choose VHA-provided care.
Assisted living represents nearly 15% of care pro-
vided during the past decade to individuals in nursing
homes, and approximately 19% of veterans using
nursing homes have disability levels comparable to
those of men supported in assisted living. Implica-
tions: As most of the increased projected use for long-
term care will be for home- and community-based
services, VHA will need to expand those resources.
Use of VHA resources to leverage community services
may offer new opportunities to enhance community-
based long-term care.

During the past decade, there have been attempts
to change the locus of long-term-care services, to
expand their scope and delivery, and to create new
services better suited to the specific needs of frail
elders, while limiting their total cost. In 1992, the
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offered
long-term-care services heavily weighted toward
provision of nursing home care (approximately
95% of all long-term-care expenditures). In contrast,
about 85% of Medicare and Medicaid long-term-
care funding went to nursing homes. By 2002, VHA
had expanded community services somewhat, but
nursing homes still captured 89% of long-term-care
expenditures. At the same time, Medicare and
Medicaid policy changes and state program expan-
sion reduced nursing home expenditures to 70­75%
of the total long-term-care funding in those pro-
grams. These changes included greater use of nursing
home preadmission screening, expansion of the role
of Medicaid home- and community-based (HCBS)
waivers, development of assisted living, expansion of
new programs such as the Programs of All-Inclusive
Care for the Elderly, and changes in medical care

delivery through expansion of Medicare and Med-
icaid managed care.
The Veterans Millennium Healthcare and Benefits
Act of 1999 (a) required VHA to provide veterans
access to a continuum of long-term-care services
including geriatric evaluation, noninstitutional re-
spite, and adult day health care; (b) required testing
of three models of all-inclusive care (modeled on the
Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) and
assisted living; and (c) specifically created a manda-
tory nursing home benefit for those veterans with
a service-connected disability rating of 70% or
greater (Priority 1a, or P1A). The Act also required
the VHA to maintain the nursing home bed capacity
that was available in 1998. Thus, the Act had the
potential to expand community-based long-term-
care services (HCBS) but also to expand nursing
home use. In this article, we characterize the enrolled
veteran population in 2002 by measures of factors
believed to influence projected use for long-term-care
services and, using VHA's population projections
and the current LTC [long-term care] Policy Model
(Version 3.1), present the projected future use for
nursing home and HCBS services for the next
decade. We do not address nonpaid, informal help
in HCBS. The primary goal of these projections is to
identify the types of qualitative changes required for
VHA long-term-care programs, as they currently
function, to meet likely use. By their nature, these
projections are based on current patterns of supply
of services and demands for care given specific needs,
which makes the precise numerical estimates some-
what uncertain.
Methods
Population Definition
The level of long-term-care use generally follows
the distribution of disabilities in a population. For
our purposes, we included both persons who report
receiving human assistance (hands on, supervision,
or standby help) with activities of daily living (ADLs;
Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963)
or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs;
Lawton & Brody, 1969) because of a health problem,
and those who report requiring mechanical or non-
human help with an ADL (low-level ADL disability).
We included the latter because requiring mechanical
help provides an objective mark of difficulty in
accomplishing an activity, but we consider individ-
uals with low-level ADL disabilities to be similar to
those who have disability only with IADLs with
respect to their need for nursing home and HCBS
services (Spector, Fleishman, Pezzin, & Spillman,
1999). ADLs represent the primary activities neces-
sary to carry out basic functions, such as eating,
dressing, and bathing; IADLs include tasks necessary
for independent community living, such as shopping,
managing finances, and cooking.
Although the long-term-care population over-
whelmingly has one or more chronic IADL/ADL
disabilities, not all users of long-term-care services
have such disabilities, nor do all who have disabil-
ities have them for an extended period. For example,
after an acute exacerbation of congestive heart fail-
ure, a veteran may have no disabilities, or may have
difficulty only with mobility related to in-hospital
deconditioning, but still receive short-term home
care services. Similarly, changes in medical practice
have shifted a portion of traditionally acute care
into the nursing home or home care setting. Thus,
the long-term-care population includes some people
with no ADL or IADL disability.
Data Sources
Although VHA has extensive data on veterans
who receive medical care through VHA, only limited
data are available on the functional status of those
veterans. What is available is recorded for specific
populations (e.g., VHA Nursing Home Care Unit
residents, Home Based Primary Care patients). For
those who do not receive medical care, data are
even sparser, for example, with regard to marital
status. Although part of the evaluation effort of
the Millennium Act was to incorporate routine
assessment of functional status, this is only now
being implemented system wide. Therefore, we com-
bined data from VHA surveys of the enrolled vet-
eran population, the National Long-Term Care
Survey (NLTCS), the National Nursing Home
Survey (NNHS), and the National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS). We discuss our use of each of
these sources below.
VHA (through the Office of the Assistant Deputy
Under-Secretary for Health) conducted two exten-
sive surveys of enrollees in 1999 and 2002; a third
survey, conducted in 2004, was not available for this
analysis. A fourth survey, conducted in 2005, was
coordinated with the 2004 NLTCS screener and will
be used for the 2007 model update. These surveys
assess areas of projected use for VHA services,
insurance availability, and functional status (self-
reported IADLs and ADLs). All were telephone
surveys, with 60­70% response rates (19,000 re-
spondents in 1999 and 38,000 respondents in 2002).
Several national surveys address long-term-care
needs, and we used them in this study. Perhaps the
best primary data source available is the NLTCS
(1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999), which contains
longitudinal and cross-sectional data on a nationally
representative sample of about 42,000 U.S. residents
on Medicare, aged 65 years or older at some point
during 1982­1999, with 17,000­20,000 age-eligible
survivors at each of the five waves of whom about
4,500­5,500 are classified as disabled, with 1,200­
1,500 in institutional residence. At the time of each
new survey, a cohort sample of about 5,000 adults
Vol. 47, No. 3, 2007 357
passing their 65th birthday in the prior 5 years is
added to the surviving sample to replace the deaths
that occurred since the prior survey and to ensure
that the new sample is representative of the entire
elderly (aged 65 and older) Medicare population.
The NLTCS covers both institutionalized and non-
institutionalized individuals, and response rates are
excellent for all five waves of the survey (95% and
greater; Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1997). All
institutionalized individuals received a detailed in-
terview, except in 1982. A screener interview targets
noninstitutionalized disabled individuals for further
study using a detailed community interview. The
screening interview is initially administered via
telephone, but slightly more than 20% of those
screened require an in-person interview to complete
the screening survey. These 20% are a nonrandom
representation of the screened population. Thus, the
NLTCS employs a nationally representative longitu-
dinal design with cross-sectional replenishment at
ages 65­69.
The NLTCS questionnaire items used to assess
ADL limitations identify activities in which the re-
spondent receives active physical help from another
person during the prior week. This provides an
objective anchor against which one can compare the
use of standby help or special equipment to cope
with lower levels of limitation. The questionnaire
also probes for activities in which help is needed but
not received, so that the entire spectrum of ADL
limitations is represented. The assessment of IADL
limitations is based on questionnaire items that
establish that the respondent cannot perform an
activity due to a disability or health problem. This
removes socially defined roles as reasons for not
performing activities such as cooking, doing house-
work, or managing bills. All NLTCS records are
linked to Medicare claims data for 1982­2001, with
ongoing periodic updating to allow tracking of
mortality, Medicare claims, and enrollment or
disenrollment in a health maintenance organization
or managed care organization.
A strength of the NLTCS is the large sample size
at ages 85 and older--a population for whom it is
often difficult to get estimates because of its rela-
tively small size. The NLTCS includes more than
2,400 people aged 85 and older and more than 825
people aged 90 and older in each survey, and the
1994 and 1999 surveys included additional over-
sampling of the population aged 95 and older (n =
540 in 1994 and n = 600 in 1999).
Comparison of the NLTCS and the VHA
enrollment file as of December 2002 found 1,543
enrolled veterans in the NLTCS panel, of whom
1,404 were eligible for the 1999 survey; the predicted
number of enrolled veterans based on the age/gender
distribution in the population was 1,459. This was
representative of 92% of Veterans Affairs (VA)
enrollees older than 65, as 8% of enrollees older than
65 do not have Medicare. The weighted NLTCS
sample, adjusted for the Medicare participation, was
2,985,364, compared to an actual enrollment of
3,054,502 (, 2% difference). Comparison of the
veteran subsample of the NLTCS with the non-
veteran, gender-matched subsample of the NLTCS
demonstrated a similar distribution of both charac-
teristics and service use. In the subsequent data, we
used these veterans, who represent a random sample
of the Medicare-eligible VA population, to stan-
dardize the ADL and IADL disability levels from the
2002 VA Survey of Enrollees.
The NLTCS has the strength of being a unified
survey of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized
individuals, but it is limited to those older than 65.
Other surveys have the strength of covering all ages,
but they are restricted to populations that are either
noninstitutionalized (NHIS, Health Retirement Sur-
vey, Survey of Income and Program Participation) or
only receive a particular service (National Home and
Hospice Care Survey [NHHCS], the 1996 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey­Nursing Home Compo-
nent [MEPS-NHC]).
To estimate the proportion of the U.S. population
in nursing homes in 1999 by age, marital status, and
number of ADL limitations, we formed a fraction
using data from two sources: the NNHS and the
NHIS. This method estimated the proportion of the
1999 U.S. population in nursing homes exclusive of
residents in other institutional settings (dormitories,
prisons, military barracks, etc.).
The NNHS current nursing home resident sample
consists of a two-stage stratified random sample of
U.S. nursing home residents. The first stage of the
sample consists of 1,423 nursing homes selected from
a population of 18,000 nursing homes via a stratified
random sample. The second stage obtained data
from 8,215 current nursing home residents from a
sample of up to six residents per home. Data on res-
idents were obtained via a combination of personal
interviews and review of residents' medical records.
The NHIS is a multistage random sample of indi-
viduals from noninstitutionalized dwelling units in
the United States. It includes an oversampling of
Hispanics and African Americans. Data were ob-
tained regarding 97,059 residents via personal inter-
views in 37,573 households. Because of the small
number of veterans represented in the population
younger than 65, we used the entire gender-
standardized sample.
We classified age as 18­64, 65­74, 75­84, and 85
or older. We categorized marital status as married
versus other, with age- and gender-specific propor-
tions imputed from the 2002 Survey of Enrolled
Veterans. Both the NHIS and NNHS defined the
following five daily limitations: (a) bathing/shower-
ing, (b) getting in and out of bed/chairs (trans-
ferring), (c) dressing, (d) toileting, and (e) eating.
In subsequent data presentations, these five ADLs
represent the core activities for disability classifica-
tion. The common IADLs as measured in the 2000
358 The Gerontologist
NHHCS, 1999 NHIS, and 1999 NLTCS were (a)
walking, (b) doing light housework, (c) managing
money, (d) shopping, (e) using the telephone, and
(f) preparing meals. These represented the core
IADLs. We described persons in the enrolled
veteran population as being in one of six disability
classes: Class 0 (no disability), Class 1 (IADL
disability or ADL deficits that do not require the
assistance of others, which we classified as low-level
disability), Class 2 (one ADL deficit requiring the
assistance of others), Class 3 (two ADL deficits),
Class 4 (three ADL deficits), Class 5 (four ADL
deficits), and Class 6 (five or more ADL deficits).
For veterans older than 65, we compared nursing
home use rates from the NLTCS and the NNHS/
NHIS, although we ultimately used the NLTCS
because of problems with the NHIS estimates
among those with significant disability and those
aged 85 and older due to small numbers. For
veterans younger than 65, we used the NNHS/
NHIS and NHHCS/NHIS as the sources for
service-use rates.
Although people often associate both long-term-
care service use and disability with elderly adults,
a substantial number of nonelderly veterans have
one or more disabilities. Among the 3,054,502
enrolled veterans aged 65 and older in 2002,
16.5% (503,736) had either an IADL or ADL
disability, whereas among the 3,198,563 enrolled
veterans younger than 65, 13.8% (441,983) had
either an IADL or ADL disability. The rates are
similar to those in the non-veteran population,
although the level of disability among veterans
younger than 65 is greater than that among their
non-veteran counterparts. However, service use
varies significantly. Nearly 40% of persons 65 and
older, but only 14% of those younger than 65,
received formal services (paid help provided by
someone other than a relative). So, whereas most
younger disabled veterans (86%) rely primarily on
informal assistance, just more than 60% of elderly
disabled veterans rely exclusively on informal assis-
tance. As both disability prevalence and particularly
use of long-term-care services increases with age,
we begin with a description of the demographics of
the enrolled veteran population.
Enrolled Veteran Population
The total veteran population is projected to de-
cline by 5 million over the next decade, and the
portion aged 65 and older will decline by 500,000.
However, the number of veterans aged 85 and older
will increase by 650,000, and the oldest-old as a
percentage of all veterans will increase from 3% in
2003 to 6.4% in 2013 (see Table 1; VHA Office of
the Actuary). The proportion of all veterans who
are enrolled in the VA is expected to increase, and
among those aged 65 and older, VHA expects its

share of enrollees to increase from 31% to 43% in
2013. Most striking, the enrollment of all veterans
aged 85 and older is projected to grow from 20% to
51%. Although there is an expected increase in the
number of enrolled veterans aged 65 or older in the
next decade, nearly 60% of the increase is projected
to be among veterans aged 85 or older (Table 1;
VHA Office of the Undersecretary of Health Policy
and Planning, 2003). The relative immediate impact
is greater over the next 5 years, as the number of
enrolled veterans aged 85 and older will increase
fourfold. This is the group with the highest prev-
alence of ADL and IADL disability and the highest
rates of formal long-term-care service use, as well as
the group for which the estimates are least precise.
Among other factors, the availability of the Part D
Medicare drug benefit may affect the currently ob-
served enrollment rates among aged veterans.
Service Use by the Enrolled Veteran Population,
1998­2002
For predicting service use, the LTC Policy Model
projects use for institutional (i.e., inpatient) pro-
grams and HCBS (i.e., outpatient) programs, ex-
cluding geriatric clinics but including homemaker/
home health aide and hospice services. Contract care
is allocated to its institutional (i.e., contract nursing
home) and HCBS (e.g., skilled home health) com-
ponents. Thus, for example, in fiscal year 2001, the
VHA long-term-care budget spent $1.6 billion
(88.5%) on inpatient programs and $235 million on
HCBS programs.
A significant aspect of the Millennium Act was the
creation of a mandatory benefit for nursing home
care for P1A veterans (70% service-connected
disability). By removing cost, which was significant
for nursing home care, it was assumed (and feared)
that a deluge of P1A veterans would exhaust all VA
nursing home capacity. (This is, in part, because
a nursing home benefit is worth between $39,000 and
$89,000/year, depending on the area of the country,
a substantial value for those requiring nursing home
care.) Thus, the nursing home use of the P1As
represents the observed projected use for a long-
term-care service VHA must provide, without
significant monetary costs to the user. By 2002, the
average daily census (ADC) of P1As was 6,820, with
3,115 in nursing home care units, 3,100 in commu-
nity nursing homes, and 605 in state homes. With
322,000 P1As enrolled in 2002, the observed use of
VHA-provided nursing home beds by P1As repre-
sented just 2.1% of the total P1A population (the
national average of nursing home residence among
the male population is 3.7%), suggesting that factors
other than cost affect the choice of VHA as a
provider of nursing home care (and the large finan-
cial benefit it represents). Using geocoding of P1A
veterans with respect to their nearest nursing home
care units, analysis suggested that propinquity may
be a significant predictor, as slightly more than half
of all P1As in VHA nursing home beds lived within
30 min of those facilities (Kinosian, Martingdale,
Ripley, & Stallard 2004). Nursing home use appears
to decline significantly somewhere between 60 and
120 min of drive time from a VA nursing home care
unit (risk ratios = 0.83 and 0.62, respectively).
Although P1As represent 26% of nursing home care
unit ADC, they use more than 70% of the com-
munity nursing home beds (Table 2). The other
significant factor, for which data do not exist, is the
number of P1A veterans who have already spent
down and are currently receiving Medicaid-funded
nursing home care. However, the impact of this
factor should decline over time as new eligible
veterans have access to the benefit. A significant
difference between the VHA-provided nursing home
benefit and Medicaid-funded nursing home care is
the absence of estate recovery provisions for VHA-
provided nursing home care.
Results
Disability Estimate of Enrolled Veteran
Population, 2002­2013
Despite declining age-specific disability prevalence
rates, the number of veterans with high levels of
ADL disability is projected to increase, especially
among those aged 85 and older. Assuming higher
declines in disability will have only a modest impact
on the number of veterans with disabilities.
The total enrollee population in 2002 was 6.2
million, of which 5.6% had two or more ADL
disabilities and 15.1% had any IADL/ADL disabil-
ity. However, among veterans older than 65, 6.3%
had two or more ADL disabilities and 16.4% had at
least one IADL or ADL disability. Over the 2003­
2013 period, among those aged 65­74, the number
with two or more ADL disabilities will remain
roughly constant at 4.2% (63,000) to 3.9% (74,000),
whereas among those aged 75­84 the number with
two or more ADL disabilities will decline from 6.7%
(99,672) to 5.5% (76,600). Among those aged 85 and
older, however, the number with two or more ADL
deficits will quadruple from 22,215 to 80,027 in 2008,
rising to more than 92,000 in 2013. This will occur
even though the proportion with two or more ADL
deficits will decline from 16% to 13.6%. Among that
13.6%, roughly 40% will have five or more ADL
deficits. Despite the overall decline in disability
among the population, the absolute growth among
those with five or more ADL deficits will be as large
a share of the total enrolled veteran growth as any
other category of ADL disability (see Figure 1).
The distribution of disability in the enrolled
veteran population is similar to the distribution in
the general U.S. male population aged 65 and older
360 The Gerontologist
(of which about 60% are veterans). The only
disability level for which enrolled veterans appear
to differ from the general male population is low-
level disability (Disability Class 1), for which there is
slightly greater low-level disability among veterans
(7.8% vs 6.4%; see Table 3).
There is controversy over whether disability rates
are declining among elders, at what level of dis-
ability, and at what rate. A recent meta-analysis
(Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002) concluded that
both ADL and IADL disability are declining, al-
though there was uncertainty as to the rate. The
above projection assumes that the decline in disabil-
ity from the 2002 level is at the same rate as the
observed mortality decline--approximately 0.6%
per year. Manton and Gu (2001) suggested higher
rates of disability decline (up to 2.4% for IADL
deficits). If disability were to decline at this observed
rate (i.e., greater than the mortality decline), the
impact by 2013 would be slight (a 6.9% decline in
those with two or more ADL disabilities, or 17,000
veterans in a total population of 244,000 with two or
more ADL disabilities). Even among those with
IADL disabilities, the decline is only 8.3% of the
total low-level disability group (24,000 among
292,000).
Projecting Long-Term-Care Service Use,
2002­2013
To describe current long-term-care service use and
project it forward, VHA developed a LTC Planning
Model (Version 2.2) that used the age- and disability-
specific nursing home use rates from the 1996 MEPS-
NHC. For the current projections, we modified that
model to (a) stratify the population by gender, (b)
stratify the population by marital status, (c) use
a uniform disability definition across data sources
and between population definition and use-rate
definition, (d) update service-use rates, and (e)
incorporate disability decline. The following projec-
tions are based on the age/gender/marital status/
disability class service-use rates. The rates are based
on the NLTCS for those aged 65 and older, on the
NNHS/NHIS for nursing home use, and on the
NHHCS/NHIS for HCBS use for those younger than
65.
These current model projections do not explicitly
include cognitive status but incorporate it indirectly
as it impacts functional disability. A more complex
revision of the LTC Planning Model (in preparation)
will explicitly incorporate cognitive impairment. Pre-
liminary analyses of the veteran subsample in the
NLTCS suggest rates of cognitive impairment some-
what higher than those in the general male population
(6.16% for those with mild­moderate cognitive
impairment [Mini-Mental State Examination score
21] compared to 5.9% in the general population;
4.36% for those with moderate­severe cognitive
impairment [Mini-Mental State Examination score
15] compared to 3.96% in the general population).
Although there is an increase in cognitive impairment
with disability class, even among those with five and
six ADL dependencies, there is a substantial portion
without significant cognitive impairment (30­50%).
Because of the incomplete mapping of cognitive
impairment and disability level, readers must use
caution when comparing individuals with similar
disability levels in settings with different levels of
supervision. For example, institutionalized individuals
in Disability Class 1 (low-level ADL disability) are
very likely cognitively impaired, requiring 24-hr
supervision. Although HCBS could be a potential
substitute for those with significant ADL dependen-
cies who do not have significant cognitive impair-
ments, more direct substitutes would be services that
provide supervision in noninstitutional settings (e.g.,
adult foster care, group homes, community assisted
living) for those with cognitive impairment.
In comparing the same stratified rates for those
aged 65 and older using the two sources (NLTCS vs
NNHS/NHIS [for nursing home] or NHHS/NHIS
[for HCBS]), we noted that whereas the projected

numerators were similar, the NHIS denominators
were low for those aged 85 and older and those in
Disability Classes 2­6 (cumulative prevalence of
5.6% vs 7.1%), producing higher rates for the
population groups with the greatest growth over
the next decade and with the highest service use.
This may have led to higher estimates in the earlier
VA model and in other models based on MEPS (a
subsample of NHIS).
The projection took the cell-specific rate and
applied it to the age/gender/marital status/disability
class­specific enrolled veteran population projected
for that year to produce the ADC for nursing home
and HCBS use. For nursing home use, ADC is
a point prevalence for the day; for HCBS use, ADC is
a point prevalence for the survey month.
Projected Nursing Home Use for Enrolled
Veterans, 2002­2013
Projected nursing facility use will increase 22%
over the next decade, all of it among those aged 85 or
older. More than half of those in institutional
settings will have four or more ADL impairments.
Experience with P1As suggests that if a mandatory
nursing home benefit is offered at little cost, 60­65%
will choose VHA to provide nursing home care.
The total projected use for nursing home care by
enrolled veterans is 1.85% overall, with 3.14% of
those aged 65 and older using institutional facilities
on a given day (point prevalence or ADC). Growth
in nursing home projected use is expected to be 22%
over the next decade, with all of the increase being
accounted for by those aged 85 and older (Figure 2).
Of those in nursing homes, 34% are in Disability
Class 6, whereas 19% are in Disability Classes 1 or 2.
The proportions in Disability Class 1 or 2 remain
relatively constant through the decade, as does the
proportion in Disability Class 6.
The observed use by P1As of VHA nursing home
care is 62% of the projected use for nursing home care
among P1As. This is similar to, but somewhat higher
than, the P1A general projected use for nonacute VHA
medical care (56%). As an experiment in the strength
of influences on projected use for VHA-provided
nursing home care, with no cost barriers, and
significant financial incentives to use VHA nursing
home care because of the lack of estate recovery, nearly
37% of eligible veterans make other choices. These
may be due to geographical considerations, lack of
knowledge, procedural barriers, or perceived quality
differences between VA and non-VA nursing home
care. It does indicate that a substantial portion of
eligible veterans will use a nursing home benefit in
VHA. By comparison, the reliance of P1As on VA for
acute inpatient care is approximately 42%. For 2004,
we found a similar percentage of P1A veterans in
nursing home beds provided by VHA (62%, or 8,753
identified among 14,096 projected total nursing home
users).
The impact of marital status and disability on
institutionalization rates is substantial. Generally,
institutional use rates are 2­4 times greater among
persons 65 and older than among those younger than

is among those 85 and older.

65 for any given level of disability. Similarly, for any
age/disability group, being married reduces nursing
home use by a factor of 2 to 3. The effect is generally
true among both men and women, although for
some groups with high levels of disability, the impact
of being married on nursing home use is less
apparent among women veterans. Detailed tables
with cell-specific values are available upon request.
Projected Use for HCBS, 2002­2013
HCBS use is projected to increase 22­24% over
the next decade, with nearly all of the growth
accounted for by those aged 85 or older. Most of this
care has been funded by other payers. Even among
those with high levels of disability, most care that is
provided is informal. This is more marked among
those younger than 65, which may reflect access
difficulties due to poorer coverage for HCBS and
represent a target area for VHA-funded services. A
significant portion (approximately 10%) of commu-
nity care is in assisted living facilities that provide
personal care and supervision.
HCBS includes skilled services (nursing, physical
therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), pri-
mary medical care (provided through VHA Home
Based Primary Care programs), adult day health
care, homemaker services (performing IADL tasks
such as cooking, cleaning, and shopping), home
health aide services (performing ADL tasks such as
bathing, dressing, transferring, and toileting), in-
home respite, and care coordination. Estimates based
only on the NHHCS, which includes only skilled
services and aide services limited to the period of
need for skilled care, are lower than those based on
the NLTCS linked with Medicare home health files,
which include formal aide services provided without
concurrent skilled treatment needs.
Supportive housing services--in which supervi-
sion and hands-on support are available--are di-
vided between those settings that provide 24-hr
medical care (usually onsite nursing) and those that
do not. In the housing supplement to the NLTCS,
those facilities that had 24-hr medical care were
classified as institutions, whereas those that did not
were considered community assisted living. The
estimates for HCBS include community assisted
living, although that is not currently part of the
VHA benefit package. We included it because those
individuals receive support for their IADL/ADL
deficits, which would need to be met somewhere.
Such community assisted living facilities and smaller
types of settings, such as group homes, offer the
personal care and supervision of nursing homes
without the onsite integration of medical care
provided in institutional settings. Thus, they are
distinct from other HCBS, which provide care for
specified portions of the day to individuals in their
own residences.
There is a substantial amount of HCBS used by
VHA enrollees. Again, comparing the growth in
service use by those aged 85 and older and the
general growth in service use, most of the growth
over the next decade will be among those aged 85
and older. As with disability, VHA enrollees appear
to be similar to all men in the NLTCS in terms of
their use of HCBS (Table 3). Note that, unlike in the
case of nursing home care, there is substantial service
use among individuals with no IADL/ADL deficits.
These are possibly individuals receiving post-acute
home care services focused on medical, rather than
functional, issues. Again, there are significant differ-
ences in service use between those who are married
and those who are not married. Among older un-
married individuals with higher levels of disability,
formal service use approaches 80­90%. However,
the lower use rates among persons younger than 65
may reflect access difficulties. As these projections
are based on actual use, and most care is paid for
outside of VHA, where coverage for individuals
younger than 65 is erratic, low use is not equivalent
to low need. Thus, the increase in use by disability
level for those aged 65 and older may well reflect
better coverage through the Medicare home health
benefit as well as community waiver programs. The
observed difference may be made up by informal
community supports for persons younger than 65.
These data combine Medicare and NLTCS
reports of formal (i.e., paid) home care services.
There is some overlap, but the NLTCS reports 30%
of home care not covered through skilled sources.
Because the number of enrolled veterans using HCBS
in the 1999 survey was small, and their similarity to
general men in the NLTCS, we used the male rates
for estimating the overlap of HCBS and the use of
community assisted living.
Although overall 20% of individuals use both
skilled home health and other personal care services,
the proportion rises to more than 40% among indi-
viduals in higher disability classes. Although there is
not a large share of any disability class receiving
services in assisted living, 80% of those individuals in
community assisted living have zero to two ADL
disabilities (39,046 of 48,441 in community assisted
living), overlapping 19% of the nursing home popu-
lation. Again, as these individuals likely have signif-
icant cognitive impairments, community settings that
may be an alternative to institutions (such as group
homes or assisted living facilities) would need to
provide a similar level of nonmedical supervision.
Using the breakdown of services observed among
men in the NLTCS, HCBS use breaks down as
follows: skilled nursing (home health agency;
23.1%), hospice (1.5%), formal care (non-skilled;
46%), an overlap group using formal skilled and
non-skilled services (20.6%), and community assis-
ted living (8.8%).
Because the VHA-supplied ADC for these services
is more than 17,000 (fiscal year 2002) to 31,000 (fiscal
Vol. 47, No. 3, 2007 363
year 2004), the vast majority of HCBS are provided
by other payers, primarily the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services and state governments,
through both Medicaid and non-Medicaid state
funding. At the 2002 VA budget-estimated average
per diem cost of all HCBS programs ($41/day),
providing all projected HCBS in 2002 would have
been $2.1 billion. In contrast, the 2002 nursing
home/skilled nursing facility budget line was nearly
$2.7 billion.
Discussion
Projected use for long-term-care services will grow
substantially over the next decade, by 22% and 24%
for nursing home and HCBS services, respectively.
Almost all of this growth will be driven by the
increasing share of frail, enrolled veterans older than
age 85. Although much of this growth is dependent
on enrollment projections (transitioning of elderly
veterans into VHA), the total population of veterans
aged 85 and older will double. As found with
pharmaceutical coverage, where VHA provided
access to services difficult or costly to obtain through
Medicare, enrollments may increase faster than
projections. Long-term care, like pharmaceuticals
prior to the Medicare Modernization Act of 2004, is
a significant area poorly covered and poorly co-
ordinated under Medicare.
Although enrolled veterans tend to be somewhat
more disabled than non-enrolled veterans, those
younger than 65 have more disability, but those aged
65 and older are only slightly more disabled than
their non-enrolled counterparts. Similarly, when
compared in terms of service use employing the
1999 NLTCS cohort, they tend to use long-term-care
services at rates similar to those of their counterparts
matched on age/gender/marital status/disability
level. For HCBS, this may represent access difficul-
ties for those younger than 65 due to limited
coverage outside of Medicaid.
Factors other than cost drive the use of long-term
nursing home care. The creation of a mandatory
nursing home benefit for one priority group in the
Millennium Act was associated with use of that
benefit by nearly 63% of the estimated eligible
veterans using nursing home care. Although less than
expected, this shows a substantial response to low-
cost long-term care but also indicates that other
factors are important in the choice of long-term-care
provider.
Growth in assisted living facilities has been
dramatic in the community but not available in
VHA. Currently, assisted living represents nearly
15% of what was previously the nursing home
population, suggesting that if VHA relies on de-
clining nursing home use rates in planning supply of
nursing home beds, it must consider the expanding
share of assisted living as offsetting that decline.
The amount of HCBS used by enrolled veterans,
including skilled and nonskilled formal care, is
substantial. Currently, those HCBS programs are
being supported by a number of other payers,
although community long-term-care services have
problems with gaps, continuity, and coordination
among providers. This large projected use, and
present patchwork of programs may provide oppor-
tunities for VHA to leverage its funding to organize
individual patches into an all-inclusive quilt (Kino-
sian, Yudin et al., 2004).
