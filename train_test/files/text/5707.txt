Abstract
Objective: To investigate the potential use of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a marker for
the surgical course following surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods: Patients with advanced CRC undergoing open colorectal surgery who did not develop
postsurgical complications were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were taken preoperatively
and at 1 day, 1 week and 3 weeks after surgery for the measurement of the white blood cell count,
serum C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and HMGB1.
Results: Data from 21 patients were analysed. HMGB1 levels changed significantly during the
surgical course, increasing from a preoperative median of 6.8 ng/ml to 12.1 ng/ml at 1 day
postoperatively, and then decreasing to 8.1 ng/ml at 1 week postoperatively and 4.0 ng/ml at
3 weeks postoperatively. These changes were similar to but were not completely correlated with
the changes seen in the other markers.
Conclusion: Serum HMGB1 may be a potential marker to monitor the surgical course in patients
undergoing surgery for CRC, although further studies are warranted before it can be introduced
into routine clinical practice.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prevalent world-
wide and many patients with CRC undergo
surgery.1 Monitoring such patients for
postsurgical complications is of import-
ance.2,3 A number of blood markers pro-
duced in response to invasive and
inflammatory stimuli have been used to
monitor the postsurgical course, including
the white blood cell (WBC) count and acute
phase reactants such as C-reactive protein
(CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA).4­9
Although typically used to detect postsurgi-
cal inflammatory complications, changes in
the levels of these markers can also reflect
the degree of surgical invasive stress.7
High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a
non-histone nuclear protein found in sys-
temic organs and tissues that when secreted
also plays an important role as a patho-
physiological mediator of inflammation.10
Levels of HMGB1 have been reported to be
increased not only in individuals with severe
infections such as sepsis11­13 but also in
infection-free individuals with invasive con-
ditions associated with oxidative stress and
triggering of the immune response, including
cancerous pathologies.14­16
To date there are limited studies investi-
gating HMGB1 as a potential marker for
detecting postsurgical complications. Suda
et al.15 reported on its use in monitoring
patients after oesophagectomy for oesopha-
geal cancer,15 whereas Takahata et al.16
studied changes in HMGB1 after gastro-
intestinal surgery in patients with various
cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, includ-
ing CRC.16 The value of monitoring
HMGB1 in patients undergoing surgery for
CRC is still unknown, and the behaviour of
HMGB1 levels in a normal surgical course in
patients with CRC needs to be determined.
The present study aimed to obtain data on
the changes in HMGB1 levels in patients with
advanced CRC following elective colorectal
surgery without postoperative complications,
with reference to concomitant changes in
conventional markers such as WBC count,
CRP and SAA.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients with advanced CRC diagnosed by
systemic imaging and histological examin-
ation who were scheduled to receive open
colorectal surgery at Jichi Medical University,
Tochigi, Japan, between March 2012 and
August 2013 were enrolled in the study.
Patients requiring emergency surgery and
those who developed postoperative infections
such as pneumonia or peritonitis or in whom
the CRC lesions could not be resected were
excluded from the study. Patients in whom
blood samples could not be taken at the four
time points (preoperatively, 1 day postopera-
tively, 1 week postoperatively and 3 weeks
postoperatively) were also excluded.
All patients gave written informed con-
sent and the study protocol was approved
by the Ethics Committee of Jichi Medical
University.
Measurement of HMGB1 levels
At the four time points, venous blood was
collected from each patient into tubes con-
taining ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid
dipotassium salt for the WBC counts and
tubes without anticoagulant for serum sep-
aration. WBC counts were measured using a
Coulter LH780 device (Beckman Coulter
Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The blood collected
for serum measurements was centrifuged at
3 500 r.p.m. for 15 min at room temperature.
Serum CRP and SAA levels were measured
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(Eiken Chemical Corp., Tokyo, Japan)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Serum HMGB1 levels were also measured
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (Shino-Test Corp., Kanagawa, Japan)
1652 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
according to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions.17 Coefficient variations in the measure-
ments for each marker were <5%.
Statistical analyses
Results were given as the mean Æ SD or the
median and interquartile range. Repeated
measures analysis of variance with multi-
comparison tests was used to analyse the
changes in each marker. Relationships
between the changes in the different markers
were analysed using the Pearson correlation
test. WBC counts and CRP, SAA and
HMGB1 levels were log-transformed
before analysis.
All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
A total of 23 patients were initially eligible
for the study; however, two patients devel-
oped postoperative complications, leaving a
total of 21 patients for inclusion in the data
analysis. Of these, 17 were male and four
were female, with a mean Æ SD age of
69.5 Æ 10.4 years. All the patients recovered
with an unremarkable surgical course. The
changes in the levels of each marker during
the colorectal surgical period are shown in
Table 1.
There was a significant change in the
WBC count over the surgical period studied
(overall P < 0.01) (Table 1). The level was
significantly increased 1 day postoperatively
compared with the preoperative level
(P < 0.01), but by 1 week postoperatively
had significantly decreased from the level at
1 day postoperatively (P < 0.01). The level at
3 weeks postoperatively remained similar to
that at 1 week postoperatively.
The levels of CRP also showed a signifi-
cant change during the surgical period
studied (overall P ¼ 0.03) (Table 1). The
level at 1 day postoperatively was signifi-
cantly increased compared with the pre-
operative level (P ¼ 0.02). The level then
decreased, with the level at 1 week post-
operatively being lower than at 1 day post-
operatively, but this difference was not
significant. By 3 weeks postoperatively the
level had significantly decreased compared
with both the level at 1 day postoperatively
(P < 0.01) and that at 1 week postopera-
tively (P < 0.01).
With regard to SAA, there was again a
significant change during the surgical period
studied (overall P < 0.01). The level at 1 day
postoperatively was significantly increased
compared with the preoperative level
(P ¼ 0.04). The level then decreased, with

The correlations between the changes in
the levels of HMGB1 and other markers
during the colorectal surgical period are
shown in Table 2. In the phase from
presurgery to 1 day postoperatively, there
was a mildly positive but insignificant cor-
relation between the changes in HMGB1
and the other three markers. In the phase
from 1 day postoperatively to 1 week
postoperatively, the changes in HMGB1
were significantly and positively correlated
with changes in the WBC count and SAA
levels, while there was a mildly positive but
insignificant correlation between the changes
in HMGB1 and CRP levels. In the phase
from 1 week postoperatively to 3 weeks post-
operatively, there was a mildly positive but
insignificant correlation between the changes
in HMGB1 and SAA levels, while there were
no apparent correlations between the
changes in HMGB1 and the changes in the
WBC count and CRP levels.
Discussion
In the present study, the serum levels of
HMGB1 significantly changed over the
course of a normal surgical period in patients
with advanced CRC undergoing elective
colorectal open surgery, with the highest
levels being seen from 1 day postoperatively
to 1 week postoperatively. The changes in
HMGB1 appeared to be similar but not
identical to the changes in other conventional
markers. These results help to clarify the
behaviour of HMGB1 levels during a normal
colorectal surgical period and further support
the consideration of HMGB1 as a marker for
monitoring the surgical course in patients

undergoing surgery for CRC, with further
studies being required on the similarities and
differences between various markers before
the use of HMBG1 levels in clinical practice.
The HMGB1 level is elevated as a systemic
reaction to surgical invasive stimuli and
tissue damage.13­16 In particular, a significant
change in HMGB1 level in cancer patients
has been reported after oesophagectomy15
and gastrointestinal surgery.16 In the present
study, the main cancer lesions were resected
and postoperative complications did not
occur, suggesting that the main effect on
HMGB1 levels after resection of cancers is
due to surgical invasiveness. In patients who
underwent oesophagectomy without compli-
cations, the peak HMGB1 level was observed
2­3 days postoperatively, with the level then
gradually decreasing until 1 week postopera-
tively,15 whereas the peak HMGB1 level was
seen 3 days postoperatively followed by a
gradual decrease until 1 week postoperatively
in patients undergoing surgery for gastro-
intestinal tract cancer.16 These results
together with those of the present study
suggest that the trends in the changes to
HMGB1 levels may be consistent, even
though the degree of surgical invasiveness
and the cancer patient populations are dif-
ferent. Confirmation of these findings would
be of value in considering the possible use of
HMGB1 for monitoring the surgical course
in patients with CRC.
The correlations seen between the changes
in HMGB1 and those in other conventional
markers are also of interest. Given that the
conventional markers are more typically used
to monitor inflammatory conditions, they
would not be expected to tightly correlate
with HMGB1 under conditions with no
apparent postsurgical inflammation.10 The
changes seen in the conventional markers
measured in the present study can be
explained by their different responses to
invasive stress.4 The WBC count is known
to show a rapid increase and then decrease in
the early stages of a postsurgical course,4
which was observed in the present study.
With regard to CRP, the narrow dynamic
range of CRP is a disadvantage when obser-
ving the changes during the surgical period;
the overall changes in CRP were barely
significant in the present study. In contrast,
SAA has a wide dynamic range,18 but the
large inter-individual differences in SAA may
make it difficult to compare the surgical
course between individuals. In the present
study, mildly positive but insignificant cor-
relations between the changes in HMGB1
and those of the conventional markers in the
early phase of the surgical course suggests
that the change in HMGB1 may have a
different origin to that of the other markers in
the immediate postoperative period. Mild-to-
moderate positive correlations between the
changes in HMGB1 and those of the con-
ventional markers, especially the WBC count
and SAA levels, in the recovery stage (1 day
to 1 week postoperatively) suggest similarity
in the origin of the change in HMGB1 with
that of the other markers at this stage. In the
stable stage (1week to 3 weeks postopera-
tively), an insignificant but mildly positive
correlation was found between the changes in
HMGB1 and SAA. Throughout the entire
surgical course, the changes in HMGB1 were
closest to the changes in SAA out of the
conventional markers studied, although this
correlation was not very strong. Clarification
of the similarities and differences among
these markers merits further investigation
for establishing the application of HMGB1
in the monitoring of patients with CRC
undergoing surgery.
The present study has a number of limi-
tations. The sample size was relatively small.
The study was preliminary in that it did not
compare the HMGB1 level among patients
with and without postsurgical complica-
tions. The patient population could not be
assessed in terms of the extent of surgical
invasiveness, as this is not evaluated in
routine clinical settings. These points
should be addressed in future studies.

In conclusion, in the present study serum
HMGB1 levels significantly changed during
the normal surgical period in patients with
advanced CRC who received elective colo-
rectal open surgery and were free of post-
surgical complications. The changes in
HMGB1 were similar to, but not completely
correlated with, those of other conventional
markers. These results suggest the potential
use of HMGB1 levels to monitor the surgi-
cal course in patients undergoing surgery for
CRC, although further studies are war-
ranted before it can be introduced into
routine clinical practice.
