Article
Persons with psychiatric illness, including substance use dis-
orders, die prematurely and are likely to succumb from inju-
ries or medical causes related to the disorders (Colton &
Manderscheid, 2006; Dembling, Chen, & Vachon, 1999;
Druss, Zhao, Von Esenwen, Morrato, & Marcus, 2011;
Maynard, Cox, Hall, Krupski, & Stark, 2004). Whether these
premature deaths are preventable is a critical question. With
respect to substance use disorders, the risk of premature
death varies by many possible factors, including type of
drug, severity of use, trajectory of drug use, co-occurring
psychiatric illness, and other personal characteristics, includ-
ing age, gender, race socioeconomic status, health status, or
health behaviors, including tobacco and alcohol use (Bargagli
et al., 2006; Kertesz et al., 2012; Smyth, Fan, & Hser, 2006).
Some of these factors are not modifiable (e.g., age), or are
very difficult to modify (e.g., socioeconomic status), whereas
others such as drug use severity are potentially modifiable.
The purpose of this article is to examine the association
between drug use severity and mortality as well as cause of
death in primary care patients with substance use disorders.
The motivation for conducting this analysis stems from the
idea that if there were an association, then intervening to
reduce severity could result in lower rates of premature
death.
Method
Patient Population
Between April 2009 and September 2012, 868 individuals
were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial designed to
examine the effects of a one-time brief intervention for prob-
lem drug use (Roy-Byrne et al., 2014).All individuals agreed
to be assessed at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
While some of these individuals had alcohol use disorders,
the focus of the study was on problem drug use and not prob-
lem alcohol use. There were 848 (98%) individuals who gave
consent for researchers to search administrative data, includ-
ing arrest records, hospital discharge abstracts, chemical
dependency treatment records, and Washington State death
records. These individuals received medical care in seven
primary care clinics affiliated with a public safety net hospi-
tal in King County, Washington. Key inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed in Table 1. Individuals enrolled in formal

Abstract
This article examines the association between drug use severity and mortality in primary care patients with substance use
disorders. In 848 individuals with known vital status, severity was low in 32%, intermediate in 38%, or substantial/severe
in 30%. Two-year survival was 93% in the low group, 96% in the medium group, and 92% in the high group (p = .19). The
age-adjusted risk of death for the high-severity group was twice that of the medium-risk group (hazard ratio = 2.00, 95%
confidence interval = [1.02, 3.93]). Individuals in the high group were more likely to die from accidents than those in the
low- or medium-severity groups (50% vs. 20%, p = .021). Compared with low- and medium-severity groups, age at death was
5 years younger in the high-severity group (52 ± 9 vs. 57 ± 6, p = .017). Premature death due to accidental causes in persons
with substance use disorders is a persistent yet complex problem.

chemical dependency treatment programs, as well as those
with high risk of imminent suicide, life-threatening medical
illness, severe cognitive impairment, or active psychosis,
were excluded. This study included 848 individuals with
known vital status.
Study Variables
For this study, there was extensive information on patient
characteristics including sociodemographic variables as well
as assessments of drug and alcohol use in the year prior to
and after study enrollment (Roy-Byrne et al., 2014). Drug
use in the month prior to enrollment was assessed with the
Addiction Severity Index (ASI; Cacciola, Alterman,
McLellan, Lin, & Lynch, 2007). The major independent vari-
able, the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), was used to
define problem drug severity as low (score = 1-2), intermedi-
ate (score = 3-5), or substantial/severe (score  6; Yudko,
Lozhkina, & Fouts, 2007). The DAST-10 was administered
only at baseline, whereas the ASI was administered at regu-
lar follow-up assessment times.
The primary dependent variable in this study was vital
status determined primarily from Washington State death
records provided by the Washington State Department of
Health. These records are electronic versions of death certifi-
cates and include the underlying cause of death. Washington
State death records from 2009 through June 2014 were avail-
able and were linked to study participants using name, date
of birth, gender, and social security number if available.
Death reporting for the first 6 months of 2014 was provi-
sional and not yet complete. Other sources of vital status
included obituaries, the Social Security Death Master File,
and primary care clinics where patients received health care.
Survival time was calculated as the number of days from
enrollment to death or June 30, 2014, for survivors. Cause of
death, available only from death certificates, was categorized
according to International Classification of Diseases, Version
10 codes and was classified as (a) diseases of the heart; (b)
malignant neoplasms; (c) external, including accidents and
suicide; (d) chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; (e) infectious;
and (f) other (Maynard & Boyko, 2006).
Statistical Method
The chi-square statistic was used to assess the association
between categorical variables and DAST-10 score category,
and the one way analysis of variance was used for continu-
ous variables such as age. Survival curves were constructed
according to the Kaplan­Meier method. The log rank statis-
tic was used to determine whether unadjusted survival dif-
fered among the three DAST-10 score categories. To further
examine whether DAST-10 score category was associated
with vital status, we ran several Cox regression analyses.
First, the unadjusted association between DAST-10 score
category and survival was determined; second, given that
survival decreases with increasing age, the age-adjusted
association was examined; and third, forward stepwise selec-
tion was used to identify statistically significant predictors of
outcome, and after all statistically significant predictors
entered the model, DAST-10 score category was forced into
the model. Finally, chi-square analysis was used to examine
the relation between DAST-10 category score and cause of
death.
Results
For the 848 participants, the DAST-10 score category was
low severity in 272 patients (32%), medium in 323 (38%),
and high in 253 (30%). Table 2 shows the association
between baseline characteristics and DAST-10 score cate-
gory. p values refer to overall association between the vari-
able of interest and the DAST-10 score category. Age
decreased with increasing severity of the drug problem,
whereas gender was not associated with DAST-10 score cat-
egory. Overall, there was a statistically significant associa-
tion between race and DAST-10 score category (p = .005).
There were 311 Black patients and 80 (26%) were in the low
DAST-10 score category, whereas there were 537 individu-
als who were not Black and 209 (39%) were in the low cat-
egory. In general, individuals in the high-severity group had
socially less stable situations in that they were less likely to
be married or living with a partner, had lower levels of edu-
cation, and were more likely to be disabled and unable to
work. Significantly, 50% of the high-severity group was
homeless for at least one night in the past 3 months.
Not surprisingly, the high-severity group had a higher ASI
drug use composite score as seen in Table 2. The high-
severity group was less likely to use marijuana, but was more
likely to use stimulants, opiates, sedatives, or two or more
drugs. Intravenous drug use was very low in the low- and
medium-severity groups, yet was much higher in the high-
severity group. Overall, the majority of participants used
alcohol and tobacco, although the high-severity group was

most likely to use either alcohol or nicotine. In the high-
severity group, 200 (79%) used nicotine in the past 30 days.
While the ASI medical status composite score was similar
across the three groups, a higher proportion of the high-
severity group had psychiatric illness, defined as ASI psychi-
atric status composite score > 0.38. Notably, a higher percent
of the high-severity group had a goal of total abstinence from
drugs.
There were 57 deaths, and 55 appeared in Washington
State Death Records. Average follow-up was 3.6 ± 1.1 years.
As seen in Figure 1, overall 2-year survival was 94% and
was 93% in the low DAST-10 score category, 96% in the
medium group, and 92% in the high group (p = .19, by log
rank statistic). Cox regression was used to further investigate
the association between drug use severity and survival.
Because survival was highest in the medium group, it was

selected as the reference category. As seen in Table 3, the
unadjusted association between DAST-10 score category
was not statistically significant. In comparison with the
medium-severity group, the hazard ratios were higher for the
low- and high-severity groups, but the differences were not
statistically different. After adjusting for age alone, the risk
of death for the high-severity group was twice that of the
medium risk group; this difference was statistically signifi-
cant as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was
1.02. In the third model, age and intravenous drug use were
the only two variables selected from candidate variables in
Table 2. After adjustment for these two factors, the hazard of
death for both low- and high-severity groups compared with
the medium-severity group was higher but not statistically
different as indicated by the wide confidence intervals.
Underlying causes for the 55 deaths that appeared in
Washington State death records are shown in Table 4.
Overall, there was no association between cause of death and
DAST-10 score category: 2(10) = 9.86, p = .45. However,
the percent of external causes of death was higher in the
high-severity group than it was in the low- and medium-
severity groups: 50% versus 20%, 2(1) = 5.36, p = .021.
Overall, there were four (two in the low group and one
each in the medium and high groups) deaths due to lung can-
cer and another four (one each in the low- and medium-
severity groups and two in the high group) due to human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syn-
drome (HIV/AIDS). Three individuals who succumbed to
lung cancer were current smokers, and two who died of HIV/
AIDS were intravenous drug users. There were an additional
seven individuals who died of chronic liver disease related to
alcohol use, three of whom were in the low-severity group.
The age at death was 52 ± 9 years in the high-severity group
and was higher in the low- (58 ± 6 years) and medium-
severity (57 ± 6 years) groups. Compared with the low- and
medium-severity groups, the 5-year difference in age at
death for the high-severity group was statistically significant,
t(53) = 2.96, p = .017.
Discussion
In this group of individuals who had substance use disorders
and received primary care in clinics affiliated with a public
safety net hospital, high-severity problem drug use was asso-
ciated with worse survival, accidental death, and earlier age
at death. The estimated death rate in this group of 848 indi-
viduals was 18.7 deaths per 1,000 per year compared with
the U.S. age-adjusted death rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 per
year in 2011 (Hoyert & Xu, 2012). While death rates were
high for all individuals in the study, compared with those
with medium severity, individuals with high severity had
twice the risk of death after adjusting for age. The associa-
tion between severity and mortality was not linear, in that
those with medium severity had better survival than those
with low severity. This is a little puzzling as the low-severity
group had less disability and psychiatric illness, although
they were slightly older and more often never married.
Individuals in the high-severity group were 2 to 3 years
younger than those with low- or medium-severity problem
drug use, yet their average age at death was 5 to 6 years
younger than their counterparts in the other two groups.
Also notable were differences in the underlying cause of
death as reported on death certificates; individuals in the

high-severity group had a higher proportion of accidental
causes such as drug overdoses than did individuals in the
other two groups. Individuals in the low- or medium-severity
groups had a higher percent of deaths due to cancer or car-
diovascular diseases, yet also died of conditions related to
substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorders.
While these findings were not particularly unexpected,
they tell a tragic story of premature death and potentially
avoidable deaths due to accidents among individuals with
problem drug use (Colton & Manderscheid, 2006; Dembling
et al., 1999; Maynard & Boyko, 2006; Ries et al., 2015).
Participants in the trial used a variety of drugs including mar-
ijuana, prescription opiates, methadone, heroin, and stimu-
lants as well as alcohol and nicotine. In addition, a high
proportion had accompanying psychiatric illness. Nationally,
there are 23 million Americans who have substance use dis-
orders, yet only 10% access treatment (Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, 2013). The stigma
associated with drug addiction and alcohol addiction to a
lesser extent is a major barrier to treatment of what has been
called the leading cause of preventable death in the United
States (Kelly, Wakeman, & Saitz, 2015).
It is beyond the scope of this study to determine whether
some deaths were preventable. Although the results were
striking, they are based on only 55 deaths that were reported
in Washington State death records. There are the usual con-
cerns about the validity of the underlying cause of death as
stated on the death certificate as well as the difficulty of dis-
tinguishing deaths due to accidents from those that were
intentional. Another limitation has to do with the measure of
alcohol consumption; individuals reported the number of
days per month they consumed alcohol and did not report
how much they drank at a given time. Consequently, it was
not possible to assess the relative contributions of drug and
alcohol use to survival.
Limitations regarding the completeness of death records
and accuracy of the underlying cause of death do not call into
question the finding that drug use severity was associated
with decreased survival and more accidental deaths. Despite
being younger than their counterparts with low or medium
severity, persons with high severity died at younger ages.
These findings have been previously reported and are
unlikely to improve without changes in the way addiction is
viewed by providers, health care organizations, legislative
bodies, and the larger society (Kelly et al., 2015).
