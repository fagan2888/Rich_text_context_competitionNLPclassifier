Introduction
This article discusses some results of a wider and deeper
research started in 2002,1 in which one tries to understand
and analyze the representations and the emotions in what
concerns discrimination against Portuguese Gypsies living
in the Lisbon MetropolitanArea and in the Setúbal Peninsula.
It is considered that it is within the interaction framework
that the representations concerning discrimination must be
captured and conceptualized. It is important to realize how
events, motivations, and their effects occur, as well as the
contexts of occurrence. From our point of view, a more
dynamic, interactionist and relational perspective is, thus,
defensible. The ethnic and national identity is built in a
way and in a dialectic relation between the I (Us) and the
Others (Them), in which the individuals mobilize refer-
ences, symbols, and identitarian markers. Following
Simmel's (1908/1986) thought, the perceptions of the dif-
ferentiations between subjects as something inherent in
interaction have been taken into consideration. The relational
character between the Us and the Others is portrayed not
only in approximations and similarities but also in opposi-
tions and partings. Following Poutignat and Streiff-Fernart's
(1995) approach, ethnic identity is the result of a set of
representations that the interacting groups build whenever
they are brought face-to-face.
The option for this theme is due, to a great extent, to its
present situation in the context of the Portuguese society and
also because of the lack of national scientific materials
regarding this subject and the selected group.
We chose to study the Gypsies for two main types of rea-
sons: It is a group that contrasts and differentiates from the
major society. Despite their condition as national citizens,
they constitute a group and an ethnic minority, also classified
as an "ill favored minority." As far as ethnicity in Portugal is
concerned, Gypsies suffer a bigger rejection, polarization
and dissimilarity.
Specifying with more details the reasons for our choice, it
cannot be denied that although the Gypsies have stayed in
Portugal for ages, they still remain as an unknown and unrec-
ognized group. Nowadays, most Gypsies who live in national

Representations About Discrimination
Practices in the Education System Built
by Gypsies (Ciganos) in the Lisbon
Metropolitan Area (Portugal)
Maria Manuela Mendes1
Abstract
In Portugal, Gypsies (Ciganos) are categorized as ethnical and minority group, and they are particularly vulnerable to poverty
and social exclusion.There is no doubt that they are one of the groups that rise more antipathy among the other Portuguese.
In what concerns the "social images" built by the dominant society, there is a negative evaluation of the Gypsies and this
image has persisted and resisted so far.Therefore,Gypsy identity and culture are considered marginal.However,the historical
discrimination against Gypsies and the existence of a scarce interaction with the non-Gypsy society are some interesting
results coming out from a qualitative study finished in 2006 about social representations and emotions that emerged in
discriminatory contexts related with the educational system.One of the main objectives of this article is to find how Gypsies
represent the school, the formal education, and the social agents that intervene in this educational context, like teachers,
other school workers, and other students (non-Gypsies). It is possible to notice some discourses that revealed negative
perceptions and rejection feelings incorporated by some Gypsies.They feel that they are treated like "inferior" persons and
not recognized by the whole society.

territory are sedentary, although the socially broadcast image
of the Gypsy lifestyle is that of an itinerant and nomadic life.
Everyday and frequently we come across widespread
media-coverage situations that show discrimination actions
toward this group; in Portugal, Gypsies are a group that
causes polemic and controversy. In the media and in peo-
ple's speech, Gypsies appear as a problematic group, as a
group that lives within or on the margins of society. In what
concerns the cultural characteristics, the Gypsies seem to be
configured in a position of high contrast in the context of the
Portuguese society--through religious affiliation, use of
own languages, a strong endogamy, and also through some
aspects that are part of their lifestyle, among which the inten-
sity of the sociability and intraethnic solidarity (based on a
strong social organization, whose fundamental pillar is the
family) stand out.
It is estimated that there are 12 million Gypsies in the
world, of which two thirds live in Europe. The biggest com-
munities are concentrated in Central European countries. In
1999, a report produced by the Work Group for Equality and
Insertion of Gypsies for the High Commissioner for
Immigration and Ethnic Minorities tells about the existence of
40,000 "Portuguese citizens that might be considered gypsies
. . . " (Alto-Comissariado para a Imigração e Minorias Étnicas
[ACIME], 1997, p. 1).
In what concerns the itinerary of empiric research and in
a perspective of thorough examination and approximation to
the "real object," the documental analysis, the statistical
analysis, and the deep interview were mobilized from among
the main techniques. This research is based on a method-
ological strategy of investigation marked by a certain plural-
ism and flexibility, where we try to use the most suitable
techniques to each level and moment of analysis. It is
inserted in the tradition of research known as constructiv-
ism, in which the main objective is to portray the multiple
realities built through a participated investigation (investiga-
tion and participant subjects), in which we try to reach the
meanings and interpretations built by the subjects (Snape &
Spencer, 2004). Language and speech being two of the main
mediations through which the transmission of the social rep-
resentation is operated, we are going to privilege, as analysis
material (central corpus), the testimonies got from the 40
interviews made to individuals belonging to the Gypsy group
(with an average duration between 1 hr 30 min and 3 hr). The
spatial scope of the present study is confined to all the munic-
ipalities that comprise Great Lisbon and Setúbal Peninsula.2
Therefore, either the space of residence, the workspace, or the
space of institutional intervention that directly or indirectly
intervenes on the potential respondents will be selected as a
starting point; in other words, it is focused in the set of "net-
works connection" of the individual to the various circles of
social inclusion. These various circles assume the interde-
pendence of these sectors and other spheres of functioning,
which are referred to the circles of relationship in which the
individual is involved, such as care in public services, access
to state resources (social, cultural, political, economic, etc.),
the working relationship, and even friendship. The informa-
tion gathered provided a comparison of contexts, situations,
experiences, and representation paths, uncovering what is
common standard and specific (singularities) to the group
and what constitutes diversity. The selection of respondents
seeks to combine and mix some criteria (sex, nationality,
marital exogamous and endogamous, and professional inser-
tion in various sectors of activity), as the aim was to capture
a variety of situations and grasp contrasting situations, illus-
trative of Portuguese Gypsies sufficient and significant.
The Representations About the
"Lived" and "Felt" Discrimination:
What Is Being Discussed?
The analysis presented in this article is centered on the social
representation built by Gypsies and apprehended through
their oral speeches. According to Jodelet (1994), to represent
or to be represented constitutes an act of thought through
which an individual relates himself to an object and inter-
acts. The social representations elaborate themselves through
and within the field of the communication relations and are,
simultaneously, a product and process of a mental activity,
through which individuals and groups reconstitute the real,
giving it a specific significance (symbolic dimension).
Processes that derive from a social and psychic dynamic inter-
vene in its production. They configure themselves as ways of
social reconstruction of the reality and construct themselves in
the social interaction, "conflicting and constituent" (Windish,
in Jodelet, 1994, p. 177).
This level of analysis allows a brief incursion in the sym-
bolic domain, namely, through the analysis of the significa-
tions that the actors confer to their practices (Vergès, 2001).
Every representation is cognitive, as it presupposes knowl-
edge to deal with the collected information. But this act of
knowledge is activated through a practice and is influenced
by the speech that circulates in society.
The social representations3 constitute a form of knowl-
edge that allows the apprehension, evaluation, and explana-
tion of the reality (Vala, 1986). One of the main functions of
the social representations is to familiarize the individuals
with what is strange, with the cultural categories as the basis:
to allow to classify and to nominate people, situations, and
objects; to compare, explain, and objectivate behaviors.
On studying the social representations, our goal is to
understand the way the individuals apprehend the involving
world, in an effort to understand it and solve their problems
(existential, emotional, relational, etc.). Social sciences study
human beings who think, elaborate questions, and try to find
answers, and thus (to be able) state that the individuals and
the groups move themselves in a context of a thinking soci-
ety, which they themselves produce through the communica-
tions they establish (Oliveira & Amaral, 2007). In short, the
Mendes 3
social representations are performative, shared, and define a
certain social situation, working as a cognitive "map," mak-
ing the social reality understandable, thus ordering the social
relations and each one's behaviors as regards the others
(Moscovici, 1988).
The production of speech tends to adjust to a situation of
power-generating purposes, in line with the intentions of the
social agent. This takes place in the language market, where
there are power relations and a set of power relations that
transcend the situation itself. The field of analysis in this
study refers to contacts, cultures, and language groups; it is
noted that these interactions are carried out according to the
representations, stereotypes, and prejudices that the Gypsies
build. The interactions between Gypsies and other groups and
their environment occur within a "structured social interac-
tion." Social agents with their conversations or "talks" enter
into communication in a field in which social positions are
objectively structured. According to Bourdieu, "the other"
that comes into interaction with the "I" is part of a power
relation that reproduces the unequal distribution of power
intermediated at the level of global society (Ortiz, 1983).
The representations produced by each other may be dis-
torted; some of the attributes of the object (human) may
appear overvalued, others undervalued, others may even be
suppressed, yet with a constituent part of the object. In this
preparation process, it is necessary to meet the specific social
position and status of each of the groups, which contributes
to the specificity and distinctiveness of representations.
But our approach has focused on the representations on
discrimination. Our attention will focus on phenomena des-
ignated by the French authors (Balibar, 1990; Guillaumin,
1993; Taguieff, 1987, 1991; Wieviorka, 1991, 1993, 1995,
among others) as institutional racism, which is based on
two ways of functioning, indissociable between themselves:
the one of differentiation and the one of hierarchism. The
former derives from identitary, communitarian, or cultural
references, expressing itself in the rejection and exclusion of
the Other, based on cultural difference (the cultural con-
trasts). The institutional racism does not necessarily refer to
the political-administrative organization but rather to social
practices that reflect "la marque du racisme" ["the brand of
racism"] and that may assume "la forme de pratiques socials
floues, presque incertaines" ["the form of social fluid prac-
tices, almost uncertain"] (Bataille, 1999, p. 286). Or rather,
they assume diffuse, little visible, banal, subtle, dissimulated
configurations; therefore, such practices are sometimes
devalued and not recognized by the victims themselves
because they understand them as socially legitimate. The
hierarchization is grounded on the inferiorization of the
Other and it corresponds to social processes that aim at plac-
ing the Other in a position of the discriminated and of the
dominated.
Knowing about events more associated with institutional
racism takes us to concentrate our sight on the way some
social spaces work, such as the housing market, the labor
market, school, police intervention, and so on. According to
Philippe Bataille (1999), the diffuse and banal practices that
become socially legitimate are accepted as normal. The
legitimacy of attitudes and discriminatory practices is based
on an ideology whose grounds are negative representations,
prejudices, and stereotypes regarding the Other.
Both types of discrimination are not exclusive categories.
They may coexist, and there are interconnections, though
subtle, between institutional racism and cultural racism.
This form of racism is grounded on the construction of the
cultural difference, making difference essential, associating
it with the construction of representations, prejudices, and
stereotypes that condition social relations. The difference is
imposed from the outside, invoking, for example, the ethnic,
national, or other origins, and that leads to treating the other
in a different way. Referring to differentiation, Essed (1991)
talks about the objectification of the Other, that is, the atti-
tude that consists in not recognizing legitimacy to someone
considered inferior, uncivilized, emotional, or primitive.
Thus, the differences that separate the Other from the I (Us)
are overvalued and exaggerated. Rather than verbalized, dif-
ferentiation is often felt, being rooted in the daily social rela-
tionships, language, habits, thoughts, access conditions to
institutions as well as state resources (Essed, 1991).
The objective is to analyze the representations of social
practices and not the individuals, although this study is cen-
tered on the daily experiences lived by the individuals, caught
through the verbal constructions concerning their experi-
ences. We asked the interlocutors or narrators to situate those
experiences in the social context they are involved. The con-
text is a determining variable, taking into account the condi-
tionings, the antecedents, and the consequences inherent to
the events reported by the interviewed. In this way, it makes
sense to recall here the notion of "everyday racism" as it is
defined and used by Philomena Essed (1991). The author
considers that racism is not strictly about the social struc-
tures and ideologies but rather conceived "as a process it is
routinely created and reinforced through everyday practices"
(Essed, 1991, p. 2). Thus, it is possible to conciliate the ideo-
logical and structured dimensions of racism and the cognitive
components, as well as everyday attitudes and experiences.
This form of manifestation "is racism, but not all racism is
everyday racism" (Essed, 1991, p. 3), involving systematic,
recurrent, familiar, and banal social practices.4 Everyday rac-
ism is a multidimensional phenomenon, and its analysis
implies that conciliation between the two interactionist per-
spectives with the microlocalized character and macro and
structuralist theories. Thus, we try to get to know and under-
stand everyday experiences, exploring both experiential and
cognitive dimension. The emotions experienced in these
events emerge in this analysis context as one more dimension
of human experience, probably the less visible, less con-
trolled, or even known as built. Its interiority makes it diffi-
cult for the externalization, namely, the verbalization and
apprehension in a research context.

Since the end of the 1990s of the last century, the social
psychologists have renewed their interest about the function
of emotions while one of the critical components of the inter
group attitudes. Philippe-Leyens et al. (2002) consider that the
most basic reaction toward strangers is emotional; in this way,
the contemporary theories of prejudice tend to transfer the
center of analysis to its emotional dimensions. Thierry Devos
et al. (2002) also affirm that the effective answers concerning
national, ethnic, and religious groups are more consistent and
reliable predications of attitudes of social distance.
In this context and starting from the presumption that the
discrimination occurs in a situation of interaction, it is rele-
vant to give an answer to several questions, such as, "How
does discrimination occur, namely in school context?" "Who
are perpetrator agents and what are their motivations?" But it
is also important to have access to representations, behavior
reactions, and emotions experienced by subjects.
The knowledge of events associated with institutional
racism led us to refocus our gaze on the functioning of some
social spaces, such as the housing market, the labor market,
school, and police intervention, among other areas. Here, in
particular, this analysis focuses on the perceptions and expe-
riences of the interviewees who are in contact with the edu-
cation system, which is very relevant given the existence of
low levels of schooling between the Gypsies in comparison
with the levels of schooling of the non-Gypsy Portuguese
and other minority groups (immigrants and nonmigrant) that
coexist in Portuguese society.
In this analysis context, the focus is on narratives about
personal experiences or situations lived by people with
whom the narrators have affective proximity links, as well as
the representations and the emotions about some events.
Brief Sociodemographic and School
Characterization of the Interviewed
Gypsies
It is important to characterize, though briefly, the Gypsy
group that was analyzed, namely, the social and demographic
aspects and above all some aspects regarding their schooling,
of the individuals, and their families.
Among the interviewees, the number of males (22 males
to 18 females), as well as a considerably higher number of
youths--about two fourths are below 29 years old--is rela-
tively higher. It is among these interviewees that the lowest
levels of schooling can be found: In a total of 40 interview-
ees, 11 of them had never attended school, 7 of whom cannot
read or write. However, it is in this group that remain the
ones who have attended at least 1 of the 4 years of schooling.
More than a half of the interviewed Gypsies cannot read or
write (7) or have only got basic reading and writing knowledge
(16). This fact is very worrying mainly among women who
hardly attend school beyond the first 4 years. None of them
succeeded in finishing the GCR (General Certificate of
Education), contrasting with men's situation where 3 managed
to go beyond compulsory education; 2 of them even man-
aged to get a degree (Table 1).
Among the 40 Gypsy interviewees, 32 individuals attended
school when they were children, whereas the other 8 did not,
mainly females (6 females vs. 2 males). Nevertheless, half of
these interviewees went back to school in adulthood. Once
more, we can notice that this group of interviewees is ill-
favored regarding the major Portuguese population, because
in 2001, the illiteracy rate was about 9% (Ine-National
Institute of Statistics, Census, 2001).
Girls'nonpermission to attend school and their early leav-
ing are also due to representations and social opinions pro-
duced, reproduced, and transmitted through several generations
of Gypsies. They assume such a degree of coercion, which is
still difficult to contradict nowadays. The interviewees attri-
bute these practices to the "ideas of the older generation," to
"tradition," and to the fact that it is not a "social practice"
within the group, as the presence of girls in school is likely
to degenerate into withdrawal and deviation regarding the
group. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid socializing with
non-Gypsies, mainly with boys.
In spite of being compulsory to attend the school system
during 9 years, this level is far from being accomplished,
namely by the Gypsy girls. Among the interviewees' chil-
dren, there are 15 youths, 7 girls and 8 boys, between 13 and
18 years of age, who are outside the school system. The dif-
ference between sexes is very evident in the precocity with
which girls leave school, usually between 11 and 14 years,
and mainly between 13 and 14 years; boys leave school a
little later, as those who do not go to school are between 16
and 18 years, which means that they quit school when they
are 15 to 16 years old. It seems that, despite the Social
Insertion Grant, namely, the insertion plan that is proposed to
Gypsy families, having generally had positive effects in
what concerns the return to and the school attendance of
children, youths, and even adults, its efficiency is still lim-
ited and with gaps.

As far as children who still attend school are concerned,
there are huge discrepancies between the education level and
the child's youth or age. It must be pointed out that, despite
the progresses that have been achieved during the last years,
there are still children who are enrolled in the education sys-
tem after the age of 6, and attending kindergarten is far from
being usual in the Gypsy group.
The Gypsies' Representations in Contexts
and Situations of Discrimination: The
Education System
Regarding this subject, it is important to pay attention to the
practices of negative discrimination, which can assume
merely manifestations, but they can turn into discriminatory
behaviors, as we will refer to later.
During childhood, the experience of contact with school,
which is above all one of the main institutions of socialization
of the major society, is not always positively evaluated by the
interviewees. Alexandrino is 32 and recalls quite well the
time when he attended a primary school and when he "felt a
little discrimination"; we could perceive that his school expe-
rience was an emotional one and was marked by some per-
sonal suffering. The tension and anguish inherent in the fact
of considering himself different (for him and for the others)
may have contributed to his predisposition to victimization.
Later, those marks vanished when at the age of 14 to 15 he
came back to the formal education system, this time in a pro-
fessional course. Alexandrino recalls how he isolated himself
from the others and could not build relations of friendship and
companionship with the Other schoolfellows.
But I suffered because I remember having no friends
at school, I didn't socialise, I even waited for school to
finish to play outside, I remember those situations till
I got free from that ghost, I think I suffered a bit . . .
because, you know, I felt I was being rejected, and
people might be treating me equally, but I saw it my
own way and thought they were treating me differ-
ently, you know, it was that ghost until I got free, until
I left school. (32 years old, 6 years of school, admin-
istration, commerce, and services employee)
In spite of having only finished the 2nd year of primary
school, Monica still remembers the blameworthy way she
was treated by her schoolfellows and the troubled relation-
ships between them. The lack of hygiene and cleanliness is
the stigmatizing information that composes the stereotype of
the interviewee and that affects her as well as many other
Gypsy girls. The interviewee says,
When we used to enter school, they would start saying
"Look at that Gypsy, the Gypsy is this, the Gypsy is
that . . . " Sometimes the kids, during the school break,
kept beating and provoking one another and calling
names "you're a Gypsy, you've got lice, you're all
dirty," it was always like that. (34 years old, services
nonqualified worker)
Other interviewees say that they were treated differently,
although in a supposedly positive way. Marisa remembers
being treated in a privileged way because she was the oppo-
site of the stereotype:
When I was six, I remember my schoolteacher intro-
duced me to the other teachers and said "look at my
little Gypsy girl, so beautiful she doesn't even seem
like a Gypsy." And do you know why? Because a
Gypsy is supposed to have lice and be dirty. If it isn't
like this, he isn't a Gypsy for sure. (29 years old, ninth
form, administration, commerce, and services
employee)
In some schools, Gypsy children tend to be concentrated
in the same class, despite their different ages, also because
some of them have strong family and affective relations and
therefore they do not want to be kept separated. Usually in
these situations, they have to socialize with younger children
who quickly top them in the school tasks. According to
Gamella (1996), this can make them feel a kind of inferiority
and that will lower their personal and social self-esteem.
School presumes that cultural and ethnic homogeneity will
facilitate learning skills.
For the interviewees, there is a kind of territorial cleavage
between the metropolitan areas and urban zones and inland
territories and small geographic areas. As a matter of fact,
discriminatory events and segregational practices occur in
remote places in the inland country, and there are no records
of such occurrences in urban areas. They are ways of pre-
venting Gypsy children from socializing with non-Gypsies.
This may be considered negative, likely to influence nega-
tively the future representations and relations between
Gypsies and the major society, thus emphasizing and rein-
forcing segregation. João states, "it is worse from that age
onwards" (45 years old, can read and write, nonqualified
worker, looking for a job). Sara blames non-Gypsies because
"Gypsies don't mind socializing with non-Gypsies, these
ones are racist" (68 years old, 4 years of primary school,
nonqualified commerce worker). Glória has six children, and
they have never experienced this type of practices. The inter-
viewee blames the adults as "children can't be guilty because
adults are racist, you know" (37 years old, can read and
write, receives the Social Insertion Income [SII] and helps
her husband in the fairs).
Júlio shows his anger for that type of actions as it dimin-
ishes the Gypsies' pride and self-esteem as a group.
6 SAGE Open
The Gypsies are not welcome at school--that is dis-
crimination. For example, in a school there are 20
gentlemen and 10 Gypsies and they don't want them
there. No wonder they are revolted. That explains why
many can't read, that happened many times . . . that's
bad because Gypsies want to be part of society and
thus they can't. People must help. That disgusts me,
because you feel down, but that also makes you feel
strong. (33 years old, cannot read or write, administra-
tion, commerce, and service worker, imprisoned)
The interviewees know through television or they have
heard about conflicts in inland regions where non-Gypsy
families do not want "to let their children join the
Gypsies . . . but that is outside the Lisbon area" (Romana,
Gypsy, 34 years old, Portuguese, cannot read or write,
housewife). These behavioral reactions of Gypsy popula-
tions are classified by Gypsies as racism. The populations
that reject the presence of Gypsy children in the schools
contradict themselves. For Rui, non-Gypsies tend to state,
"No, I'm not racist. I just don't want to have my children
together with Gypsies. This happens because, as I've
already told you, we are, we the Gypsies, have been trying
to integrate for a short time" (32 years old, 7 school years,
intermediate- and independent-level technician of com-
merce and services).
These situations, which cause conflicts between Gypsies
and non-Gypsies, turn into accusations against Gypsy chil-
dren with disruptive and unusual behaviors. Clara reveals
that she was "shocked" with what she saw on TV and won-
ders, "how can there be people who are capable of doing
such things?" She still remembers the accusations against
Gypsy children: "they even say they beat and took knives
and so. People like these should be helped, otherwise, if
nobody cares, they will go on" (29 years old, Portuguese, can
read and write, nonqualified commerce employee).
The manifestations of hostility are started by non-
Gypsies, and for the interviewees, such reactions demon-
strate rejection and distance from the major society.
The communication relations between family and school
are sometimes troubled, namely, when conflict situations
between children or eventually between children and auxiliary
teaching staff occur. In these situations, the family intervenes
to defend the attacked individual, as Fábio clearly reports:
My brother beat an African, he is 12, and the assistant,
who was African too, beat my brother or something
like that, he wore glasses, he bled in the teeth. Then
my grandma went there and my mother wasn't there,
we were not there, she went out in the morning and we
didn't find her. She defended her race. That was rac-
ism. (16 years old, attends a professional course)
Some of the interviewees point out that the teaching­
learning process the child is subjected to at school is
different from the non-Gypsy one. David refers that there are
teachers who, to get rid of some children, let them pass the
year, although they have not achieved the minimum
objectives:
When they are fed up with those children . . . they
can't stand them anymore . . . they don't want to be
with them for another school year. Although the child
requires a bit more attention, they can't stand her
because that's a naughty child. I think that a teacher
must be an expert in dominating, like psychologists.
(37 years old, 4 years at primary school, unemployed,
nonqualified worker, job seeker)
Some people, like Cristiana, think that in some schools,
the teachers neglect the Gypsy child's learning process. The
child, who feels discriminated, consequently rejects school
"because teachers only teach non-Gypsies" (43 years old, 9
school years, receiving SII, nonqualified commerce worker).
Labeled as "difficult children," disobedient to rules, aggres-
sive, hyperactive, undisciplined, feeling rejected and unwel-
come, they may refuse going to school, feeling outside and
frustrated.
David points out the difficulties experienced at school by
children who live in poor slums labeled as dangerous and
problematic. At school, children are treated in a different
way suffering the stigma of being aggressive and "wild" (37
years old, Portuguese, 4 years at primary school, unem-
ployed, nonqualified worker, job seeker).
It's becoming a relatively usual practice within the territo-
rial context analyzed to enroll the children on a school as
soon as they are six. However, it is less common and almost
rare to enroll them in nursery schools. At that age, the child
and its own family are not prepared for schooling yet, because
the children are not used to being closed, nor even sitting for
a couple of hours; they have no rules associated with order,
assiduity, and so on. Daniel, 38, graduate, has a life and
school course that can be still considered singular among
Portuguese Gypsies. He thoroughly describes the main diffi-
culties of adaptation of these children in school context:
Then . . . those children getting used to stay there for
6, 7 hours, isn't it? Almost running--they have that
short break--I must admit . . . not 6 hours, from 8 till
13, isn't it? Around 5 hours with a short break. But
that's too long . . . too long for someone who never
. . . who has never been used to . . . habits. Suddenly,
you're there closed--I can't say imprisoned, because
it isn't, poor guy, it's not that bad, school isn't that bad
. . . but I try to understand why they can't find motiva-
tion. But that's not all. They are used to play in the
slum.
In the Gypsy context, the strategies of socialization and
the type of education usually adopted by parents, which
Mendes 7
seem to be distant from what school preconizes, must be taken
into account. Regarding the socialization of these children, the
relational and affective dynamics assumes a particular impor-
tance at intrafamily relationships and communitarian ones.
According to J.-P. Liégeois (1987), "a child's education is col-
lective. It usually lives within three or four generations, and
its socialisation takes place in this set which reinsures cohe-
sion, coherence, continuity and safety" (p. 61). Actually,
socialization is not unidimensional; there is always a game
of multiple influences, thus being "multidimensional and
systematic" (Seabra, 1994, p. 30), as children's preparation
lies on life experience basis.
It is also worth pointing out teachers' stereotypes regard-
ing Gypsy families, that cannot help being noticed by the
interviewees themselves. They are aware that, generally, par-
ents are considered hostile to school; the functioning codes
and the language used by teachers and other school staff seem
distant and unintelligible. The noncommunication with
school is also related with family projects and family organi-
zation; the importance of habitus, which integrates all the past
social experiences and of ethnic capital. There is a feeling of
being outside school, a telling of impotence regarding school,
there is actually a failure of knowledge and expectations.
Among the interviewees, the existence of a real lack of
assistance and investment in preschooling of Gypsy children
is evident. The lack of or scarce qualifications of parents, as
well as the rhythms that mark their economic activity, inter-
fere in the lack of accompaniment of these children. However,
parents show a protecting educational style and find that
their children either in kindergarten or at school do not
deserve the same protection and attention of teachers, thus
internalizing exclusion feelings. In these contexts, external
to the family and the group, children are not as protected as
within the family (Seabra, 1994, p. 98). Nelson is a defender
of Gypsy children's preschooling and says,
That should have been done 20 years ago. Because if
it had been done 20 years ago, people would have
more time to do other things and kids would be
brought up in a different way. They might come back
home and behave differently, but something remains
there. (30 years old, Portuguese, 6 years of school,
administration, commerce, and services employee)
The objective conditions of existence have a great impact
on the school life of these children, as well as personal and
family motivation. Going to school is still an obligation, not a
priority. Jorge refers to the importance of school in the system
of values of the Gypsy group:
While the ordinary citizen is educated so that school
may be an essential thing in life, as a kid he's brought
up at home, he goes to school because he is made to
and when he finishes he'll go to the fairs, so school
won't be of any good. (47 years old, higher education,
intellectual and scientific high-qualified worker)
School is still seen by Gypsies as an institution of the
major society (non-Gypsy), with which a relationship of sus-
picion and fear is kept. According to Jorge, school is for
Gypsies a "state entity that has lasted for centuries, and the
state has always served to keep us down, to push us, to beat us,
it has served for nothing" (47 years old, Portuguese, university
degree, intellectual and scientific high-qualified worker).
Besides, the pedagogical procedures at school do not
seem to coincide with the ones handled within the family.
Learning based on real experiences is privileged, that is,
knowledge is knowing how to know, knowing how to be,
knowing how to do, and essentially doing to do. As Liégeois
(1987) says, the pedagogical procedures "take place in the
context of real tasks and through the participation, not through
a verbal instruction, and as preparation for a future participa-
tion" (p. 63). The pedagogic contents are also very distinct, so
the same author points out that for Gypsies, the problems are
essentially the daily ones, "those of personal interaction, the
logical formal generalisations are unknown, not useful and
replaced by real and particular symbolisms that refer to shared
and reciprocal experiences" (Liégeois, 1987, p. 63).
It is also worth saying that, due to the living conditions
and the set of values of the ethnic Gypsy group, the early
contact of the child with books and school articles is not
usual. The access to video is easy, as well as to Playstation
games, Gameboy, DVD, which can condition their learning
in school context. Another kind of difficulties these children
may go through has to do with the lack of help when doing
schoolwork. Filipe says, "the family relatives are `old fash-
ioned,' they can't read or write" (29 years old, Portuguese, 3
school years, nonqualified worker, imprisoned). However,
the difficulties and limitations regarding reading and writing
are also evident as the children tend to write and speak hav-
ing as reference point the pronunciation used in the oral
communication among Gypsies.
The logic of organization within the Gypsy group seems to
be far from the way the school institution is structured. Its life-
style is based on the present, the immediate, the survival, and
the management of everyday life, valuing the results rather
than the processes. Owning a certain level of schooling is not
important for the ethnic and relational capital of the individual
within his in-group. Nevertheless, the acknowledgment of the
group may occur if the individual gets a degree. Francisco
emphasizes that it is not valued "the way to `reach' and when
someone gets there, it's wonderful, everybody talks about it,
even if they don't know the person `ah, the Gypsy is this, that
Gypsy is that" (29 years old, 12th form, unemployed, admin-
istration, commerce, and services employee).
The school life of Gypsy children and youths is nothing
more than a short and ephemeral passage, marked by more
or less long pauses--absences due to illnesses, weddings,
8 SAGE Open
funer
als, baptisms, or other ceremonies or even blood quar-
rels--and due to definitive or transitory ruptures (definitive
abandonment and reenrollment) regarding the educational
system.
In a lifestyle in which the child is considered the most
valued central element within the family, if the child feels no
interest or even dislike for school, either for fancy or fear, or
certain ingenuity, the family will not easily contradict its
will.As a matter of fact, absenteeism depends not only on the
attitude of refusal of underage individuals but also on their
parents'lack of interest. Among Gypsies, it is also the family
that has the education mission, not school.
For the non-Gypsies, education is clearly permissive,
negligent, with no prohibition, rules, physical punishments,
and control. But reality goes beyond what is apparent, and
indeed these children, from a very early age and in a collec-
tive process with great affection, are prepared for their
autonomy and independence as well as for the respect for the
fundamental and structural values of the Gypsy group. In
this context, Francisco refers parents'behavior whenever the
child rejects school:
As soon as the child comes back home crying, or sad,
or something, saying that it didn't like school as par-
ents want to please their children, the first thing they
do is "you won't go to school then," because what
matters is happiness, . . . if the child is happy, every-
thing is alright. (29 years old, 12th form, unemployed)
The child's happiness and satisfaction, as well as the need
to give immediate rewards, also justifies that parents do not
try to contradict their child, among other already clarified rea-
sons, owing to the fact that the group is characterized by a
lifestyle marked by the present, the instant, the immediate.
Some interviewees do not criticize so much the possible
maladjustments concerning teaching methods, syllabuses,
and timetables, but above all the strictness and inflexibility
of the school institution, namely, in what concerns some cul-
tural practices of the group that directly interfere with the
school results. Nelson thinks Gypsies are misunderstood,
especially when there are blood quarrels. "Affections are very
important for Gypsies" and therefore school "should some-
times understand certain situations. Some youths are about to
pass the year and when some things happen, they have to join
other families, they quit school and then they fail" (30 years
old, 6 school years, administration, commerce, and services
worker).
The implementation of the SII in 1996 had a positive
impact at short and medium term concerning the brief and
relative continuation of the stay of the Gypsy group in the
education system. On one hand, it allowed the massive return
of children and school age youths to the education system.
On the other hand, it allowed an increase, though not a very
significant one, of the average levels of schooling within the
Gypsy population in general. Jorge is 48 years old and a keen
defender of this measure:
Because there was a time when compulsory education,
on one hand, and the SII on the other, generated a
movement through which all the Gypsy children went
to school. . . . However, parents have the minimum
motivation to send children to school, unless they
know that otherwise they won't receive that grant.
And that's the carrot and stick approach. Great, I'm in
favor of it. That's alright. (38 years old, higher educa-
tion, high-qualified worker)
Conclusive Notes
In what concerns the Gypsy group, it's important to under-
stand what happens within it and how it works internally and
in contact with the outside, to realize how difficult and com-
plex the relationship network, established by this group and
the school, is.
On a discoursive level, the valorization and importance
that school assumes for these interviewees is evident; never-
theless, it's possible to find signs on the practices level that
contradict the discourse. In fact, it can't be denied that for the
last 20 years, the levels of schooling of the Gypsy population
have slightly increased, mainly among the male population.
At least in this way, they may profit from a basic social right,
and, therefore, they acquire knowledge that allows them to
decipher some cultural elements of the non-Gypsy society and
have access to some if its resources. They tend to attribute an
immediate utility to school--reading and writing, getting a
driving license, getting the SII, and so on. In the previous
generations, of some parents and mainly grandparents and
great grandparents, nobody attended school.
Of course, this tendency has to do with wider and global
processes, which go beyond the Portuguese society. Indeed,
one of the processes that is more closely linked to social
mobility courses in the contemporary Portuguese society
concerns the rapid increase of the education levels (Almeida,
Costa, & Machado, 1993), having a crucial role in the dynam-
ics of the modern societies. Although such a process is far
from having had identical repercussions in the ethnic Gypsy
group, there is an improvement in the school and socioprofes-
sional profiles of the members of this group. Nevertheless,
the inequalities and the contrast factors between Gypsies and
the society in general are still being reproduced.
Among the Gypsies, the child quickly becomes a young
adult, for the period of adolescence and youth is almost non-
existent. In general, children from an early age help parents
in street trading or other work activities. Girls, in turn, tend
to stay home and to take care of siblings and perform house-
hold chores to prepare for the assumption of the roles of wife
and mother because they marry early today, which implies a
rapid transition to adult social status, assuming family
Mendes 9
responsibilities, among which includes ensuring that physical
subsistence of the family group made up. But the transition
from child to young adult life despite being a little later for
boys than for girls, still at an early age, is largely due to
strong family pressures and the in-group.
Early school leaving by girls is caused by family decision,
and this is basically a social and ethnic conditioning. The
repetition of this practice is based on the alleged "tradition"
and supposedly "fragile" and more "weak" moral woman,
suspecting that his stay in the school system can only result
in their perversion and deviation from the in-group. The
pressure group and censorship even today determines the
parents' decision.
Among the respondents, the numbers of early school leav-
ers are concentrated in age groups between 10 and 15 years;
there was slight but no less important nuances depending on
the gender of individuals. Men leave school at the age thresh-
old from 13 to 15 years; except for three cases that were
beyond the secondary level, the remnant left school before age
18. Women tend to leave school even earlier, namely, between
10 and 12 years by their own initiative and will.
Considering that education is compulsory during the first
9 years (until 20095; remember that this research was made
between 2002 and 2007), is it possible to register such drop-
out rates? The social policy measures (Rendimento Mínimo
Garantido or Minimum Income Guaranteed) cannot break
down and overlap the practices historically and socially legit-
imized by their families to cause the premature abandonment,
particularly of the girls.Among Gypsies, there still persists an
attitude of devaluation of the schooling and the education by
parents and families, little or no schooling, combined with the
maintenance of lifestyles in which it operates early passage of
children and preteen to adult life, with the assumption of
social responsibilities that this entails.
In addition, Gypsies seem to carry a burden of feelings
of rejection and inadequacy with an impact that cannot be
neglected on the decrease of the levels of self-esteem and
on the assumption, in a relatively indelible way, of emo-
tions such as shame,6 humiliation, and embarrassment. It is
even admitted that there may be a certain predisposition to
victimization and that the Gypsy individual will tend to
interpret nonintentional meanings in the actions of the other
individuals, perceiving any action perpetrated by the non-
Gypsies as racism. But it is important to point out that
among the interviewees, it is consensual that when Gypsies
feel discriminated, namely in a school context, they also
feel underestimated and tend to rebel and react "abruptly"
because they also feel distressed and nervous, as pride and
personal and group self-esteem are affected. The majority
of those who have experienced situations perceived as dis-
criminatory states that they feel revolt. Sometimes the
revolt is associated with sadness, fury, and anguish. There
are also repressed, hidden, and covered feelings that may
possibly be perceived through the analysis of the nonverbal
components of their behavior.

3. This concept has in its genesis the notion of "collective rep-
resentations," as it was referred by Émile Durkheim, when
he wrote "`une fois constituées, deviennent des réalités par-
tiellement autonomes,' agissant par l'action d'explication, de
formulation et d'information (au double sens de façonnement
et de diffusion), inhérente à toute forme de représentatiton"
["`Once constituted, become partially autonomous realities',
acting through the action of explanation, formulation and
information (in both senses of shaping and dissemination),
inherent to any form of representation"] in Champagne et al.
(1990, p. 99).
4. Philomena Essed (1991) clarifies that "everyday racism is
infused into familiar practices, it involves socialized attitudes
and behavior. Finally its systematic nature indicates that every-
day racism includes cumulative instantiation." They are "prac-
tices prevalent in a given system" (p. 3).
5. According to the Portuguese decree law n.º 85/2009 (August
27, 2009), compulsory education in Portugal has increased (no
longer 9 years, it is now 12 years).
6. Scheff (1997) mentions that already in the 1960s, Goffman
pointed out that shame is a social emotion that emerges in the
social interaction and that it conciliates well the individual and
social aspects of the human activity, regulating the proximity
and the distance regarding the others.
