From conception to death, helping relationships
promote positive development and enable people
to surmount challenges in their lives. Is it the case
that the negative consequences of a genetic propen-
sity for risky behaviors can be attenuated by helping
relationships (a G × E)? But is it also the case that
people with such a genetic propensity are less likely
to have helping relationships compared to people
without such a propensity (a rGE)? We illustrate this
complex pattern of gene­environment interplay by
drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health and a combinatoric analytic strat-
egy. We focus on a gene associated with dopamine
receptor type 2 (DRD2 TaqIA), student­mentor
relationships, and educational continuation beyond
secondary school. Results reveal that, for both white
and black males, DRD2 A1+ (A1A1 and A1A2 geno-
types) is associated with a decreased likelihood of
school continuation compared to their counterparts
with DRD2 A1­; mentors who are teachers compen-
sate for this negative association (a G x E); and
youth with DRD2 A1+ are less likely to have a
mentor who is a teacher than their counterparts
with DRD2 A1­ (a rGE).
Helping relationships -- involving one's parents,
peers, teachers, mentors, spouses, adult children,
fellow congregants, neighbors, and so on -- are typi-
cally thought to foster adjustment and health,
broadly conceived, by promoting positive develop-
ment and enabling people to surmount adversities.
Yet what if people with a genetic propensity for
risky behavior are more likely to benefit from
helping relationships but less likely to have them
when compared with people without such a propen-
sity? This pattern suggests both a gene­environment
interaction (i.e., those with a genetic propensity for
risky behavior will benefit more from a helping rela-
tionship than those without such a propensity) and a
gene­environment correlation (these same people will
be less likely to have a helping relationship). This
paper explores these complications, focusing on the
case of the student­mentor relationship, DRD2, and
continuation beyond secondary school, which is a
strategic empirical example.
In the American context, educational continuation
beyond secondary school has major implications for
adulthood, including life-long patterns of income
(Geweke & Keane, 2000; Restuccia & Urrutia, 2004)
and physical and mental health (Avison, 2005;
Dohrenwendet al., 1992; Miech & Shanahan, 2000;
Ross & Wu, 1995; Schnittker, 2004). In turn, income
and health are related to myriad aspects of successful
aging -- including subjective assessments of life satis-
faction, marital quality, and community involvement
-- suggesting a pivotal and crucial role for education
in the life course.
Mentoring is of special significance because
models attempting to predict which students con-
tinue beyond secondary school have traditionally
focused on the socioeconomic status of the parents
and the educational aspirations that they maintain
for their children (Sewell et al., 1969). But such a
view has expanded to include influential, non-
parental adults (mentors) and indeed research
suggests that youth who are involved in a mentoring
relationship experience more academic success than
their peers without such relationships (Bryant &
Zimmerman, 2003; Hamilton & Darling 1996;
Klaw et al., 2003; Zimmerman et al., 2002).
Nevertheless, most prior research focuses on `at-risk
youth' with little attention to comparatively diverse
samples (Rhodes et al., 1994; Rhodes et al., 1992;
Zimmerman et al., 2002).
We consider DRD2 Taq IA, a gene that is associ-
ated with dopamine type 2 receptors. DRD2 has
been linked with phenotypes that would be disad-
vantageous in educational settings. Positron emission
tomography shows that the presence of the DRD2
TaqI A1 allele is associated with lower density of

dopamine receptors and a reduced number of
dopamine binding sites in the striatal region in the
brains of healthy, living humans (Jonsson et al.,
1999; Oohjalainen et al., 1998), perhaps more so in
the ventral caudate and putamen (Thompson et al.,
1997). These regions of the brain have been associ-
ated with the reward system, impulse control,
planning, and related behaviors, and the dopaminer-
gic system has been linked to reward-seeking
behavior in humans (e.g., Pessiglione et al., 2006).
Studies with nonhuman animals suggest a role of D2
and D2-like receptors in premature responding and
impaired accuracy of responses (Pattij et al., 2006),
impulsive choice making (van Gaalen, Brueggeman,
et al., 2006), inhibitory control (van Gaalen, van
Koten, et al., 2006), and deficits in the initial acqui-
sition of task-governing rules (Glickstein et al.,
2005). The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
also suggests behavioral correlates including alco-
holism, Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and
Tourette's syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance
in Man, 2006). Taken as a whole, these and related
studies (for example, using DRD2 knockout mice,
see Kruzich et al., 2006; Pezze et al., 2007; Smith et
al., 2002; Tran et al., 2002) suggest that although
the exact associations among DRD2 alleles, specific
neural processes, and specific phenotypes are not
presently understood, DRD2 A1+ is associated with
phenotypes that would undermine school perfor-
mance and educational attainment.
The present study focuses on (1) whether DRD2
A1+ is associated with continuation to college/univer-
sity; and, if so, (2) whether mentoring relationships
can attenuate this association (i.e., a G × E); and
finally, (3) whether DRD2 A1+ is associated with
having mentors (i.e., a rGE). In addition to these sub-
stantive interests, we illustrate the usefulness of a
combinatoric approach to studying gene­environment
correlations and interactions by applying a novel ana-
lytic method to the study of genes and behavior,
Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), and by
drawing on molecular genetic data available in Wave III
of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health). In so doing, our paper highlights
a new analytic strategy for researchers interested in the
interplay of genes and environmental factors, a point to
which we return in the Conclusions and Discussion.
Mentoring: DRD2 Interplay
and School Continuation
Given the relationship between DRD2 and phenotypes
that would be disadvantageous in classrooms, we
expect that DRD2 A1+ will be associated with poor
performance in social settings that call for high levels
of self-control, such as schools, workplaces, and fami-
lies. In the school setting, a career of such behaviors
-- possibly including substance abuse and impulsivity
-- will culminate in a lowered probability of
matriculation to college/university (Hypothesis 1).
Could this relationship be buffered by mentoring? If
so, do students with DRD2 risk develop mentoring
relationships in the first place?
Mentors and DRD2
Mentoring represents a form of social capital, which
refers to links among actors (in this case, the student
and the mentor) that facilitate action (in this case, edu-
cational continuation; Portes, 1998). Prior research
distinguishes between formal and informal mentoring
and most studies of mentors focus on the former:
youth who are candidates for organized mentoring
programs due to a high risk of failure, at least in terms
of their educational prospects (see Rhodes et al., 2000)
or their social disadvantage (e.g., Bryant &
Zimmerman, 2003; Rhodes et al., 1994). Informal
mentors are relatives, friends, and other community
members with whom youth have developed relation-
ships through their existing social networks.
The distinction between formal and informal
mentors maps onto the distinction between bridging
and bonding social capital. Bridging social capital con-
nects actors who differ with respect to salient
resources and thus bridging capital is believed to be
especially important in reducing soecioeconomic
inequalities (including education). Formal mentors are
likely to represent bridging capital because programs
assign people with special skills and knowledge to
assist students without such skills and knowledge.
Teachers who are mentors, although perhaps not
formal mentors, also represent bridging capital
because they possess a high level of experience with
and insight into the educational system. In contrast,
bonding social capital connects actors who do not
differ appreciably in their salient resources.
Accordingly, informal mentors who are not teachers
are likely to lack expertise in the educational system
and thus constitute bonding capital.
These distinctions suggest that teachers as mentors
may be especially salient forms of bridging social
capital. Because of their expertise with the educational
system and personal knowledge of the student, a
mentor who is a teacher may contribute to school con-
tinuation in the presence of DRD2 A1+ (Hypothesis 2)
by encouraging appropriate behavioral comportment
and good decisions about schooling. On the other
hand, a nonteacher mentor, lacking these insights and
skills, may be of little assistance (Hypothesis 3).
Are some youth more likely to have teachers as
mentors? Rhodes (2002) suggests that adolescents
who are competent and goal-driven may appear a
`better investment' of a teacher's time than youth who
are impulsive and lack planful competence. Thus,
youth with DRD2 A1+ are expected to attract fewer
teachers as mentors than youth with A1­ (Hypothesis
4). Taken as a whole, these hypotheses suggest that
teachers may be especially beneficial to students with
DRD2 A1+, but that these very same students are less
likely to attract teachers as their mentors.

Helping Relationships and Genetic Propensities
Differences by Sex and Race
Could these processes be complicated by sex and/or
race? Most of the evidence that suggests links among
DRD2 alleles, neurobiology, and behavior is silent on
issues of sex and race. Biological studies that link
DRD2 with neurobiological structure and function
restrict attention to males or often fail to find
male­female differences. Thus, for example, DRD2
risk is presumed to lower neuronal density and
binding site availability equally in the striatal regions
of males and females, and whites and blacks.
Likewise, the animal literature linking DRD2 allelic
variation with behavior typically focuses on males
(e.g., Wistar rats) and the race distinction obviously
has no nonhuman animal homologue. Finally, studies
linking DRD2 alleles and behaviors in humans do not
provide consistent evidence for sex or race differences,
with apparently no attention devoted to the latter.
Nevertheless, sex and race differences in the pro-
posed hypotheses may be observed. With respect to sex,
females and males are socialized differently, such that
many behaviors that would be deemed inappropriate in
the classroom (e.g., disruptive behaviors) would be con-
sidered especially problematic for females. Thus, the
effect of DRD2 on continuation may be smaller for
females than for males (Hypothesis 5).
Some theories of social capital maintain that it
serves the majority's interest to reproduce inequalities
(e.g., Bourdieu & Passeron, 1990), an argument typi-
cally construed in terms of socioeconomic strata but
applicable to race distinctions as well. Stanton-Salazar
and Dornbusch (1995) argue that racial/ethnic minori-
ties find supportive ties in school settings and
community organizations, but these ties are often
problematic because institutional agents of the school
(e.g., teachers, coaches) tend not to share subcultural
values and norms with nonwhites. This line of reason-
ing suggests that teachers may have little or negative
association with continuation among blacks
(Hypothesis 6). In effect, hypotheses 5 and 6 suggest
that blacks, particularly black males, will not benefit
from either bridging or bonding capital.
Sample
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health) was based initially on a nation-
ally representative sample of youth in grades 7
through 12 in the United States. Data have been
obtained from the adolescents themselves, and from
their parents, siblings, friends, romantic partners, and
from school administrators. The National Quality
Education Database provided the sampling frame with
its list of all high schools in the United States
(N = 26,666). To qualify, a high school had to include
an 11th grade and an enrollment of more than 30 stu-
dents. From this frame 80 schools were selected. The
sample was stratified according to several distinctions,
including region, suburban/urban/rural, school type
(whether public, private, parochial), ethnic mix, and
size. Fifty-two of the 80 schools agreed to participate,
and 28 replacements schools were selected based on
the stratifying variables. Each of the 80 schools was
paired with a middle school (based on its contribution
to the high school student body). A total of 145 of the
schools agreed to host a confidential in-school survey
which focused on adolescent health and friends. This
first wave yielded 90,118 students from grades 7 to 12
(in 1994). Nearly four out of five schools provided a
roster from which the first in-home interview sample
was drawn.
From the rosters, students were randomly selected
for a 90-minute interview, conducted in the home.
Approximately 200 students were recruited from
schools in each school pair, regardless of size. This
procedure resulted in a self-weighting sample. A total
of 20,745 adolescents in grades 7 through 12 (ages 11
through 19) were interviewed at home. This in-home
wave of interviews with target child and parent was
carried out in 1995, between April and December. The
second in-home interview encompassed youth who
were in the 7th to 11th grades at Wave I, was compa-
rable to the first interview in its coverage, and was
carried out between April and August of 1996. The
Wave II in-home survey resulted in a sample of 14,738
youth between the ages of 13 and 20. A third wave
was collected between August 2001, and April 2002
from Wave I participants, resulting in 15,197 18- to
26-year-olds.
The present study draws on data collected from
students and parents at Wave I and from youth at
Wave III. In Wave I, data were collected from a
sibling pairs subsample; 64% of the cases arose from
the Add Health probability sample, and 36% of the
pairs were collected as a convenience sample. The
sibship sample is composed of 1249 full-sibling pairs,
424 half-sibling pairs, and 657 biologically unrelated
pairs. DNA data were collected from some of the
sibling pairs at Wave III (n = 2574), with genotyped
DRD2 data available for 2557 individuals. The
average sibship size among the 2557 individuals is
1.88, with a standard deviation of .46; an inspection
of the frequency distribution for sibship size shows
that almost 79% of the youth have one other sibling
in the dataset and about 17% are singletons.
Thus, the DNA subsample of Add Health is not a
probability sample. Comparisons between the fully-
weighted Wave I school-based dataset and the DNA
subsample (not shown; available upon request) reveal
similar levels of parental socioeconomic status,
parental involvement in school, and school quality,
and somewhat higher levels of talking to parents
about school in the latter. These comparisons also
reveal that the DNA sample is more educated, more
likely to belong to a nonintact family, more likely to
live in the West (as opposed to Northeast), and more
suburban (as opposed to rural).
Finally, among the 2557 individuals in the DNA
subsample, there were missing data: about 10% for

variables from the parent dataset, about 2% for the
Wave I youth data, and less than 1% for the Wave III
measure of educational continuation. All analyses are
based on 10 imputed datasets, resulting in an effi-
ciency of estimates exceeding 97% (Rubin, 2004).
Measures
DRD2
The gene spans over 270 kb with a large first intron
(250 kb) and maps to 11q22.3-11q23.1 (Eubanks et
al., 1992). The TaqIA polymorphism (Grandy et al.,
1989) is the most commonly studied and is located
about 10 kb down stream from exon 8, which is the
end of the DRD2 gene (Kidd et al., 1996). The TaqIA
polymorphism refers to a single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of the gene
(and so may act via an associated, functional polymor-
phism in an adjacent gene). The A1 allele has a point
mutation C  T (TCGA to TTGA), which eliminates
the TaqI site. This polymorphism was assayed at the
Institute of Behavioral Genetics, University of
Colorado-Boulder.
The DRD2 TaqIA assay (Haberstick & Smolen,
2004) was performed using the fluorogenic 5'nuclease
(Taqman®, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Unlabeled forward and reverse primers were purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA).
VIC and FAM labeled probes were puchased from ABI.
All reactions were performed in an ABI Prism® 7000
Sequence Detection System using the allelic discrimina-
tion mode (Livak, 1999). Reactions contained 1 µl
(approximately 20 ng) of DNA, 8.5 µl of water, 0.5 µl of
40x primer/probe mix and 10 µl of 2 × Taqman®
Universal Master Mix. Final primer and probe concen-
trations were 900 mM and 200 mM, respectively. The
seqences of primers and probes were: Forward Primer:
5'-GTGCAGCTCACTCCATCCT-3'; Reverse Primer: 5'-
GCAACACAGCCATCCTCAAAG-3'; Probe 1: 5'-
VIC-CCTGCCTTGACCAGC-NFQMGB-3'; Probe 2:
5'- FAM-CTGCCTCGACCAGC-NFQMGB-3'.
Probe 1 (VIC/NFQMGB) anneals to the `A'-con-
taining SNP (TaqIA-1, 304 bp, no restriction site)
and probe 2 (FAM/NFQMGB) anneals to the `G'-
containing SNP (TaqIA-2, 178 bp, containing the
restriction site.) Cycling parameters used were a 10
minute hold at 95ºC followed by 40 cycles of 92º C
for 15 seconds and 60ºC for 60 seconds. Each 96
well plate included six nontemplate controls, four
samples homozygous for the A SNP, four samples
homozygous for the G SNP and two heterozygous
samples. Genotypes were scored independently by
two individuals. Preliminary analyses supported the
distinction between DRD2 A1+ (A1A1 and A1A2)
and A1­ (those students homozygote for A2), a dis-
tinction supported by many other studies (e.g., see
Noble's 2003 review). Research conducted at the
Institute of Behavioral Genetics indicates that
DRD2 is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (Smolen,
January 2007, personal communication).
Mentors
All mentoring data come from the Wave III in-home
interview data and were reported by the young
person. Informal mentors were identified with the
following question: `Some young people know
adults, other than their parents, who make an impor-
tant positive difference in their lives. Some do not.
Has an adult, other than your parents or step-
parents, made an important positive difference in
your life at any time since you were 14 years old?'. If
there was more than one influential adult, respon-
dents were asked to report only on the most
important. The mentor's social role, or relationship
to the young person, was identified by the respon-
dent as an adult relative (older brother, younger
brother, older sister, younger sister, mother's mother,
mother's father, father's mother, father's father, aunt,
uncle, spouse or partner), friend, teacher (teacher or
guidance counselor, coach/athletic director), or com-
munity member (minister, priest, rabbi, or religious
leader, employer, co-worker, neighbor, friend, ,
friend's parent, doctor/therapist/social worker,
other). These two items -- whether a respondent had
a mentor and, if so, the role of the mentor -- were
used to create three sets: no mentor, mentor who was
not a teacher, and mentor who was a teacher. Finally,
the youth were asked `How old were you when
{HE/SHE} first became important in your life?'. This
item, combined with the mentor status item, were
used to assure that mentors became important after
age 14 but before age 18 (i.e., during high school for
the vast majority of youth).
Parental Socioeconomic Status
Research on educational continuation traditionally
focused on the important role of parental socioeconomic
status and so we include this variable in our analysis.
Socioeconomic status is the average of two variables
standardized (mean = 0 and unit variance), highest com-
pleted parental education (1 = 8th grade or less,
2 = more than 8th grade but did not complete high
school, 3 = went to business, trade, or vocational school
instead of high school, 4 = high school graduate,
5 = completed a Graduate Equivalency Diploma,
6 = went to business, trade, or vocational school after
high school, 7 = went to college but did not graduate, 8
= graduated from college or university, 9 = professional
training beyond a 4 year college or university) and
logged household income (ranges from $0 to $999,000).
Physical Appearance and Attractiveness of Personality.
Although the analyses focus on DRD2 and mentors,
other factors undoubtedly contribute to the elicitation
of help from mentors. We include two such factors,
physical attractiveness and attractiveness of personal-
ity. After the interviewer finished administering the
Wave I In-Home materials, he or she answered the
following questions on a 5-point Likert scale: `How
physically attractive is the respondent?' and `How
attractive is the personality of the respondent?'.

Helping Relationships and Genetic Propensities
School Continuation
Respondents were asked `What is the highest grade or
regular year of school that you have completed?'. This
items was then used in conjunction with six other
items asked about degrees received to categorize youth
into two sets: did not continue education beyond high
school; continued education beyond high school.
Analytic Strategy
The hypotheses focus on whether DRD2 alleles are
related to school continuation (Hypothesis 1); teachers
as mentors can attenuate the association between
DRD2 and school continuation (Hypothesis 2); non-
teacher mentors will not attenuate this association
(Hypothesis 3); and students with DRD2 risk are less
likely to attract teachers as mentors then students
without such risk (Hypothesis 4). Further, we expect
that the link between DRD2 risk and continuation
rates will be stronger for males than for females
(Hypothesis 5) and that the positive effect of teachers
will not be observed among blacks (Hypothesis 6).
Hypotheses 1 and 5 are addressed with a simple
comparison of continuation rates across groups defined
by DRD2's alleles. The remaining hypotheses are
addressed with QCA (Ragin, 1989). QCA is an analytic
method that combines Boolean algebra with descriptive
statistical analysis. A `set' refers to a group of people
defined by one independent variable. Combinations of
sets are called `configurations.' Rather than trying to
discover the net causal effect of single independent vari-
ables, QCA assesses how each configuration compares
to other configurations on their level of the dependent
variable. In so doing, QCA is well-suited to the study of
gene-environment interplay.
Consider a simplified example: a theory predict-
ing that Y reflects A (a gene), B (a contextual
variable), and C (another contextual variable), all of
which are dichotomous variables (i.e., 0 or 1). A, B,
and C each define a set. Rather than estimating the
net effect of each of A, B, and C, QCA instead
creates an 8-cell typology that combines their possi-
ble values (i.e., three variables with two response
categories = 23 = 8 configurations). We can then
examine how many people are in each configuration
compared with expectations given the marginals,
which could reveal a r(GE). We can also compare
the proportion of people with Y = 1 across the eight
configurations, which would reveal a G × E. If we
found, for instance, that both A·b·C1 and A·B·C
stood out positively relative to the other configura-
tions, we could use Boolean algebra to reduce this
solution to A·C. (B and b cancel each other out as
long as they are the only differences between the
solutions.) That is, a specific polymorphism (A)
accompanied by a specific context (C) significantly
increase the likelihood that Y = 1 and B is irrelevant.
There are several advantages to QCA compared
with more traditional methods. First, it takes seriously
the fact that real life may reflect high levels of
contigencies among predictor variables. Second, it
provides a model that treats `interactions' between
variables with greater sensitivity than general linear
models. In a general linear framework, for example,
the interaction term (A) × (B) would be scored 0 if the
respondent was either a or b or both. It therefore
treats potentially very different kinds of situations as
the same type of thing. QCA preserves these differ-
ences by looking at all configurations.
In the present analyses, we are interested in dif-
ferences in school continuation rates. To form the
explanatory configurations, we rely on six variables:
DRD2 A1+ (G), having a mentor (M), having a
teacher as a mentor (T), high parental socioeco-
nomic status (S), physically attractive (A) and
attractive personality (P).
The `crisp variant' of QCA (explained above)
assumes that each person is (1) or is not (0) a member
of each configuration of sets. A crisp set approach
thus yields 48 configurations of sets and each person
is a member of only one of these configurations.
(There would be 26 (or 64) configurations except that
m*T is logically impossible.) For example, a person in
the configuration of sets `youth with no DRD2 risk,
has a mentor, that mentor is not a teacher, high
parental status, not physically attractive, and attrac-
tive personality' would belong to that configuration of
sets (i.e., their membership would equal 1 for a
dichomotomous variable representing that configura-
tion of sets) and would not belong to any of the other
configurations of sets (i.e., membership = 0 for each of
the other 47 configuration of sets).
Given low subsample sizes, particularly for the
black males and females, we employ a fuzzy set
variant of QCA, which allows for partial membership
in sets. Accordingly S, A, and P are `fuzzified' by con-
verting their z scores into their equivalent place on the
cumulative normal distribution, which has a natural
range of 0 to 1, noninclusive. (The DRD2 variable G
and the mentoring variables M and T necessarily
remain dichotomous.) In order to provide sample-spe-
cific fuzzy membership, we linearly rescale these
values such that the minimum for each set is 0 and the
maximum is 1. Following standard practice (Ragin,
2000), we combine individual sets into configurations
using the minimum value of the constituent sets. For
example, a respondent with G = 1, M = 1, T = 1,
I = .44, S = .90, and A = .85 would have membership
.44 in the set G·T·S·I·Q·A, 0 in the set
g·T·S·I·Q·A, and .10 in the set G·T·s·I·Q·A. That
is, most respondents will provide information about a
number of configurations of sets simultaneously.
Drawing on fuzzified sets and their configurations,
we consider the broad issue of G × Es involving DRD2
and types of mentors using two strategies. First, for
each one of the 48 configurations, we statistically
compare its school continuation rate with the average
rate of the 47 other groups. To allow for such com-
parisons, we generate values for `proportion

compared to the average of the other 47 using an F
test. (The formula automatically weights the
responses so that respondents with low values of a
configuration count less toward producing the value
of Isk,y than do respondents with high values of a
configuration.) Translating this into set-theoretic lan-
guage, this formula essentially asks the question `to
what extent is this configuration (X) a subset of the
outcome (Y)?'. The resulting value (of Isk,y) can
range from 0 (X and Y do not overlap at all) to 1 (X
is completely included in Y).
These comparisons identify configurations that
are significantly different from the rest of the popula-
tion in their rates of continuation (either positively or
negatively). Among configurations with a signifi-
cantly higher continuation rate (i.e., `positive
stand-out configurations'), we then use Boolean
algebra to simplify the solution (e.g., A·B·C plus
A·b·C reduces to A·C). The same procedure is also
applied to the negative stand-outs, or those configu-
rations with significantly lower continuation rates.
These comparisons thus identify configurations of
DRD2 and mentorships that are sufficient to produce
results that are significantly different from other con-
figurations that are closer to the overall sample's
continuation rate.
Second, we focus on genetic differences in contin-
uation rates within social capital configurations.
Combining the variables (M, T, S, A, and P) yields 24
possible configurations. Within each of these 24 con-
figurations, do continuation rates differ by genetic
variation (i.e., DRD2 A1+ and A1­)? We address this
question by conducting an F test of the difference in
school continuation rate between these two groups.
These analyses compare continuation rates between
DRD2 A1+ and A1­ groups in the same configura-
tion of sets of social context.
All analyses were conducted with Stata and
fsQCA software packages and adjust standard errors
for nonindependence of observations due to sibships.
Findings
Is DRD2 associated with continuation to the tertiary
level? Table 1 reports the mean continuation rates for
groups defined by race, sex, and DRD2. For males,
continuation rates are significantly different between
DRD2 A1+ and A1- groups, and the differences are
notable in magnitude. White males with A1­ have an
average continuation rate of 59.3, compared to white
males with A1+, who have an average continuation
rate of 44.4, a substantial difference. Black males with
A1­ have an average continuation rate of 51.5, com-
pared to black males with A1+, who have an average
continuation rate of 34.7, a difference also of consid-
erable magnitude. Within each race, these differences
are statistically significant, although no such differ-
ences are observed for the white or black females.
Thus, DRD2 TaqI is associated with continuation to
the tertiary level, but only among males (consistent
with Hypotheses 1 and 5). Because of this lack of
association among the white and black females, the
combinatorial analyses that examine the moderating
influences of social capital will be presented for white
and black males only.3
Mentoring, School Continuation, and DRD2: White Males
The conceptual model suggests that mentoring will
compensate for the association between DRD2 and
school continuation. To address this question, we
compared the continuation rates of each configuration
of sets with the 47 other configurations of sets. The
`positive stand-out' and `negative stand-out' configu-
rations -- those having statistically better and
statistically worse continuation rates than the rest of
the configurations -- are presented in Table 2 for
white males. The top panel shows the negative stand-
outs, the bottom panel shows the positive stand-outs.
For example, youth who belong to the set
G·m·t·s·a·p, `A1+, no mentor, no teacher mentor,
low parental socioeconomic status, not physically
attractive, and personality not attractive,' have an
average continuation rate of .338 versus an average
continuation rate of .547 for the remaining configura-
tions of sets, a difference that is large in magnitude
and statistically significant (F = 27.52 with 636
degrees of freedom, p = .000). In contrast, youth in
g·M·T·S·A·P -- belonging to the `opposite' set --
have an average continuation rate of .792. and this
difference is also statistically significant (F = 35.23
with 636 degrees of freedom, p = .000). Indeed, these
two configurations have the lowest and highest proba-
bilities of continuation, respectively.
Using Boolean logic, the stand-out configurations
shown in Table 2 reduce to three parsimonious solutions:
White males, positive stand-out:
g·M·S or g·M·T·s·A·P
White males, negative stand-outs:
m·s or G·t·s
That is, two configurations produce better-than-
average continuation rates: A1­ coupled with a

mentor and high socioeconomic parents or A1­
coupled with a mentor and low socioeconomic
parents and all of the following: a teacher mentor,
physical attractiveness, and an attractive personality.
Thus, having A1­ is a necessary component of posi-
tive stand-out continuation rates. Further, in the case
of high socioeconomic parents, any mentor will
suffice, be he/she a teacher, friend, minister/rabbi,
and so forth. This pattern is consistent with the idea
that high socioeconomic status students attract high
socioeconomic status informal mentors. In contrast,
in the case of low socioeconomic parents, the mentor
must be a teacher and the student must be attractive
physically and in personality. Perhaps low socioeco-
nomic status students must attract teachers as
bridging capital and they do so through their per-
sonal attractiveness.
The negative stand-outs all involve low socioeco-
nomic status. Additionally, white males lacking a
mentor do less well, as do males with A1+ and low
socioeconomic status and no teacher mentor. Taken as
a whole, the results suggest the importance of socioeco-
nomic status (or, in the alternative, attractiveness), A1+,
and mentors, especially teachers for low socioeconomic
status students. Follow-up analyses reveal that
mentoring matters less for students with A1+: there is a
14.4 percentage point increase in continuation rates for
students with A1- (i.e., comparing g·m with g·M, .504
versus .648, respectively), in contrast to 4.4 percentage
point increase for youth with A1+ (i.e., comparing G·m
with G·M, .431 versus .475, respectively).
Table 3 shows the continuation rates within the
configurations of sets for A1+ and A1- white males.
The table is divided into three panels. The top panel
shows youth with no genetic differences in average con-
tinuation rates. Common to every configuration in this
panel is m·t -- no mentor (and thus no teacher
mentor). In contrast, the bottom panel shows youth
with no genetic difference in continuation rates.
Common to every configuration in this panel is M·T,
having a teacher as mentor. Finally, the middle panel
shows configurations with higher continuation rates
among those students with A1­ compared to students
with A1+. Common to all of these configurations is
M·t, having a mentor who is not a teacher. That all
24 configurations would fall perfectly into these three
groups provides striking evidence to the effect that,
among white males, (1) nonteacher mentors benefit
students with A1­; and (2) only teachers can compen-
sate for DRD2 A1+, and they do so completely.

Figure 1 summarizes the broad patterns of Table 3.
For white males, those youth without a mentor have
lowest continuation rates irrespective of DRD2 allele.
For youth with an informal mentor who is not a
teacher, only students with A1­ benefit and the
difference in average continuation rates between risk
groups is appreciable in magnitude and statistically
significant (as documented in Table 3, middle panel).
Finally, teachers as mentors fully compensate for A1+:
70% of A1­ students continue to college, while 65%
of A1+ risk students continue, and this difference is
statistically insignificant.
Nevertheless, what percentage of white male stu-
dents have A1+ and attract a mentor, especially a
teacher as mentor? To address this question, we cross-
tabulated DRD2 allelic variants with five mentor
categories (none, friend, relative, teacher, and commu-
nity). The omnibus chi-squared test is marginally
significant, indicating that DRD2 risk status is
weakly associated with the distribution of these men-
torship statuses (chi-squared with 4 degrees of
freedom = 7.99, p = .092). An inspection of the table
nonetheless suggested a significant difference involv-
ing teacher mentors and an additional test revealed a
statistically significant difference: DRD2 A1+ is asso-
ciated with fewer teacher mentors (13.10%) than A1­
(18.72; chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom = 4.84,
p = .028). Indeed, 46 white males have A1+ and a
teacher as mentor.
Consistent with expectations, then, teachers fully
compensate for DRD2 A1+ with respect to educational
continuation beyond secondary school, but youth with
A1+ are less likely to attract teachers as mentors in the
first place.
Mentoring, School Continuation, and DRD2: Black Males
Turning to black males, we once again begin by exam-
ining positive and negative stand-out configurations.
The top panel of Table 4 shows negative stand-outs,
those configurations with lower than average continua-
tion rates, and the bottom panel shows the positive
stand-outs. Parsimonious solutions can be obtained by
applying Boolean logic to the table, which results in:
Black males, positive stand-out: g·M·t·S or g·M·t·s·A·P
G·M·T·S
or G·M·T·s·A·P
Black males, negative stand-outs: G·m·s·a
or G·M·t·s·p
That is, black males do better than average in several
circumstances. First, among black males with A1­, a

nonteacher mentor and high socioeconomic status or
both physical and personal attractiveness. Second,
among black males with A1+, a teacher mentor and
high socioeconomic status or both physical and
personal attractiveness. These results are especially
noteworthy in two respects. As was observed among
white males, physical and personality attractivess can
substitute for parental high socioeconomic status.
Black males with A1+ also require a teacher as a
mentor. However, white males with A1­ require a
teacher mentor, while black males require a non-
teacher mentor.
Common to the negative stand-outs for black
males are A1+ and low socioeconomic status. These
factors may be coupled with no mentor and low
physical attractiveness or a nonteacher mentor and
low attractiveness of personality. Common to white
and black males with lower than average continua-
tion rates, then, is no mentor and low
socioeconomic status or DRD2 A1+ and no teacher
mentor. Once again, the results highlight the impor-
tance of socioeconomic status, A1+, and mentors,
although there is a high level of contingency operat-
ing among these factors.
Table 5 shows the average continuation rates
within configurations of sets and across groups
defined by DRD2 allelic variant. Once again, the table
is divided into three panels. The top panel shows con-
figurations including m·t -- black males without any
type of mentorship. These configurations generally
have low continuation rates and there are no differ-
ences by DRD2 allele. This pattern was also observed
for white males. Configurations in the middle panel
differ significantly, with black males with A1­ having
significantly higher average continuation rates.
Common to all of these cases is M·t, indicating the
presence of a mentor who is not a teacher. This
pattern was also observed among the white males.
Finally, the bottom panel (M·T) shows configurations
that are, with few exceptions, significantly different in
their continuation rates, with black males with A1­
having the lowest average continuation rates.
The patterns suggested by Table 5 are shown in
Figure 2. For black males without mentors, DRD2
status does not make a difference for average continu-
ation rates (although the magnitude of the difference
may appear large, the difference is statistically
insignificant). Black males benefit from a mentor who
is not a teacher only if they have A1­. These patterns
were both observed for white males. Likewise, only
teachers as mentors compensate for A1+. Unlike white
makes, however, black males with A1­ have much
lower average contuinuation rates. While these data
points are based on few cases (12 for A1+ and 19 for
A1­), the difference is statistically significant. We
return to this finding in the final section of the paper.
The results show that, once again, the negative
association between DRD2 status and average contin-
uation rate is fully attenuated only by mentors who
are teachers. A cross-tabulation of DRD2 status by
types of mentors yields an insignificant omnibus test
(chi-squared with 4 degrees of freedom = 4.69,
p = .321), indicating no global differences in DRD2
status and mentoring. However, an inspection of the
table reveals that black males with A1+ are less likely
to have a teacher for a mentor (9.84% versus 19.03%,
respectively), which was confirmed by a post hoc test
(chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom = 3.94,
p = .047). In other words, teachers as mentors are
uniquely capable of eliminating DRD2 differences in

Conclusions and Discussion
Although helping relationships are central to positive
development and surmounting challenges in life, few
studies appreciate that receiving help is endogenous
and that its effectiveness depends on the nature of the
proffered help. With respect to endogeneity, helpers
are not randomly distributed across people: some
types of people are more likely to elicit and maintain a
relationship with a helper. If people in need of help are
defined in terms of genetic propensity for risky behav-
ior, this pattern of endogeniety suggests a
gene­environment correlation according to which
such people are least likely to be party to a helping
relationship. With respect to effectiveness, some
helpers are uniquely suited to help those in need
because of their special skills and knowledge. The
well-intentioned neighbor or friend may or may not be
capable of helping with specific problems. Once again,
if need is defined by genetic propensity for risky
behaviors, this reality suggests a gene­environment
interaction according to which a specific risk's nega-
tive implications are attenuated by certain types of
help but not others. In short, perhaps people in need
of specific help are likely to benefit from it but also
unlikely to receive it. Cast in terms of DRD2, perhaps
students with A1+ will benefit from teachers as
mentors but be less likely to receive such support than
students with A1­.
These complexities have been illustrated with the
strategic example of DRD2, mentors, and continua-
tion beyond secondary school. After acknowledging
limitations to our empirical example, we discuss the
findings and then briefly consider the value of combi-
natoric approaches to the study of genetics, social
context, and the life course.
First, there is no `college gene.' Success in school
and the likelihood of extending one's education
beyond secondary school undoubtedly depend on
many skills that are influenced by genetic action. Our
theoretical model posits that risk associated with
DRD2 increases the likelihood of behaviors that
undermine the student's ability to do well in school
and thereby the likelihood of continuing one's educa-
tion beyond high school. But what are these
behaviors that trace to DRD2 and that interfere with
school performance? Prior research is suggestive in
only molar terms: impulsivity, poor ability to learn
based on rewards and punishments, poor ability to
delay gratification. Exactly how students differ in
their school-related behavioral repertoires is
unknown, however.
In specific terms, how are DRD2 A1+ students dif-
ferent from A1­ students? This question assumes
special importance given that the continuation rates of
both white and black girls did not differ by DRD2
allelic variant, and given the DRD2-teacher as mentor
correlation. Males with DRD2 A1+ must differ pheno-
typically from males with A1­ and, in turn, the A1+
males differ from the A1+ females. But how? The
question calls for a genetically informed, classroom-
based ethnography. A related question for future
research posed by the findings concerns black males
and teachers as mentors. Drawing on the work of
Stanton-Salazar and Dornbusch (1995), we hypothe-
sized that black males would not benefit from mentors
who are `institutional agents' of the school because
such mentors typically do not share `subcultural
values and norms' with racial and ethnic minority

students (p. 119). This expectation proved insightful
with respect to black males with A1­, but not for
black males with DRD2 A1+. There is very little
research on minorities and school-based mentors and
the finding for the latter group is presently inexplica-
ble. Again, the new questions raised seem best suited
to a genetically informed ethnography.
Second, given limitations in sample size and mea-
sures, we can only consider a small number of
relevant indicators of mentors and genetic candi-
dates. As with all studies conducted in a qualitative
comparative framework, our models were formu-
lated with attention to theory and prior research.
Nevertheless, there are numerous genetic and social
candidates that could plausibly be incorporated into
our models. With the larger genetic sample of Wave
IV of Add Health, we will be able to examine many
additional, plausible possibilities.
Third, because of our reliance on quasi-experimen-
tal methods, we can not rule out the possibility of
spurious findings. Perhaps DRD2 is not in itself
important but rather it is closely associated with other
genetic candidates that are causally linked to behav-
iors that detract from one's educational
accomplishments. Our conceptual model is based on
persuasive evidence with respect to genetic and social
mechanisms and indeed it generated a set of hypothe-
ses that proved insightful. Nevertheless, like all
quasi-experimental studies, the present findings
support provisional conclusions that call for further
study informed by other theoretical frameworks and
tested with other samples, measures, designs, and sta-
tistical models.
Finally, QCA is attractive as a descriptive frame-
work capable of detecting high levels of contingency
among independent variables, but this is accomplished
with a multitude of contrasts, raising the possibility of
false positives. Replication is especially important in
these circumstances. Indeed, our findings comport
closely with our expectations, which provides a solid
justification for future replications.
Mentor­DRD2 Interplay
The results suggest that DRD2 A1+ is associated with
decreased likelihood of school continuation (consistent
with Hypothesis 1), but only for boys (consistent with
Hypothesis 4) and these trends are considerable in mag-
nitude. Further, as expected, teachers as mentors are
able to compensate for this risk completely for white
and black males and these trends are also considerable

in magnitude (Hypothesis 2). Among white males with
A1+, about 43% with no mentor or a nonteacher
mentor continued their educations beyond high school,
compared to 60% with a teacher as mentor (see
Figure 1), a pattern yet more pronounced among black
males (see Figure 2). In contrast, nonteacher mentors
had no effect on average continuation rates, consistent
with Hypothesis 3. Perhaps because of their knowledge
of the educational system and understanding of the
student, teachers are uniquely qualified to advise stu-
dents about their educations, including addressing
issues of behavioral comportment in the classroom. It
may be that, lacking this unique perspective, non-
teacher mentors were ineffective in fostering
educational continuation.
Nevertheless, white and black males with A1+
were significanty less likely to report having a teacher
as mentor, consistent with Hypothesis 4 and indicating
a gene­environment correlation. Conceptual consider-
ations suggested that teachers were less likely to
mentor students with A1+ than students without such
risk perhaps because the former's consistent patterns
of impulsive behaviors and poor self-regulation made
them `poor investments' of limited helping resources.
Finally, Hypothesis 6 predicted that the positive
effects of teachers as mentors would not be observed
for black males. The evidence on this point is mixed.
Black males with A1+ benefit substantially from
teachers as mentors and, in this sense, the (null)
hypothesis is disconfirmed. Black males with A1­
show the hypothesized pattern, however. As suggested,
an ethnographic study might help clarify the meaning
of this pattern.
The over-arching pattern suggested by these data
for the white and black males is clear: the link
between DRD2 A1+ and continuation beyond high
school is fully attenuated by mentors who are teach-
ers, but males with A1+ are less likely to have a
mentor who is a teacher then males with A1­. As with
all studies documenting gene­environment interplay,
replication is essential.
Combinatoric Strategies for Studying G­E Interplay
In addition to revealing new findings and raising
new questions about the role of mentors in the edu-
cational process, the present analyses also illustrate
the usefulness of a combinatoric approach to the
study of gene­environment interplay. Combinatoric
approaches begin with the assumption that people
belong to sets and that sets form configurations. The
sets may be defined by genetic, social, psychological,
and other types of variables. The immediate issues
then become: which configurations of sets exist?
How common is membership in each configuration
of sets? And how is membership in a configuration
associated with other variables, both antecedents
and consequences?
As shown in the present example, such an
approach is well-suited to studying gene­environment
correlations and interactions simultaneously. What
allele­social context configurations exist? And what is
the likelihood of being a member of a specific configu-
ration? These are questions that get to the heart of
gene-environment correlations. In the present case,
DRD2 A1+ decreased the likelihood of belonging to
any configuration that included a teacher as mentor.
Aside from the percentage of people populating each
configuration, are combinations of specific alleles and
specific contextual behaviors related to a criterion
variable in a nonlinear fashion? This is a question
about gene­environment interactions. In the present
case, mentors who were not teachers increased the
probability of continuation, but only for students with
A1­. Teachers alone, acting as mentors, were capable
of neutralizing DRD2 A1+.
Beyond the specific example of DRD2, mentor-
ing, and education, combinatoric strategies are a
presently neglected but valuable analytic approach
to the study of genetics and social context. Given
specific genotypes, what social circumstances are
people in? And how are these patterns, in turn,
related to health and well-being? Sociological and
psychological findings clearly establish the impor-
tance of `significant others' for positive
development. Future research will ideally join
insights from behavioral genetics with these find-
ings, drawing on analytic strategies that are
sensitive to ongoing gene­environment correlations
and interactions.
