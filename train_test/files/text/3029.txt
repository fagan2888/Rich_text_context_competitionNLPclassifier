Background: Folate has been linked to cardiovascular
disease (CVD) through its role in homocysteine me-
tabolism.
Objective: To assess the relationship between serum fo-
late and CVD mortality.
Design: In this prospective study, serum folate concen-
trations were measured on a subset of adults during the
Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (1976-1980) and vital status ascertained after 12 to
16 years.
Setting and Patients: A national probability sample
consisting of 689 adults who were 30 to 75 years of age
and did not have a history of CVD at baseline.
Main Outcome Measure: Vital status was deter-
mined by searching national databases that contained in-
formation about US decedents.
Results: The associations between serum folate and
CVD and all-cause mortality differed by diabetes status
(P=.04 and P=.03, respectively). Participants without
diabetes in the lowest compared with the highest serum
folate tertile had more than twice the risk of CVD mor-
tality after adjustment for age and sex (relative risk
[RR], 2.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-6.09).
This increased risk for participants in the lowest tertile
was attenuated after adjustment for CVD risk factors
(RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 0.96-5.40). Serum folate tertiles
were not significantly associated with total mortality,
although the age- and sex-adjusted risk was increased
for participants in the lowest compared with highest
tertile (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.96-3.15). Risk estimates for
participants with diabetes were unstable because of the
small sample size (n=52).
Conclusion: These data suggest that low serum folate
concentrations are associated with an increased risk of
CVD mortality among adults who do not have diabetes.

LOW SERUM folate concentra-
tions have been linked to ca-
rotid artery stenosis,1 pre-
sumably through folate's role
in homocysteine metabo-
lism, and by association to an increased
risk of atherosclerosis. Homocysteine is
formed during the metabolism of methio-
nine, an essential amino acid released dur-
ing protein digestion.2-5 Remethylation of
homocysteine to methionine occurs
through 2 pathways, one of which re-
quires folate as a methyl donor and vita-
min B12
as a cofactor.2-5 Thus, low serum
folate concentrations could lead to el-
evated homocysteine concentrations. In-
deed, several studies6-10 have shown that
serum folate concentrations are inversely
related to homocysteine concentrations in
healthy individuals. Elevated homocyste-
ine levels have been associated with an in-
creased risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), as summarized in recent review ar-
ticles.2,3,11 A number of potential mecha-
nisms through which homocysteine may
be atherogenic have been proposed; ho-
mocysteine may exert a direct toxic ef-
fect on endothelial cells, promote oxida-
tion of low-density lipoprotein, increase
DNA synthesis in and promote the pro-
liferation of smooth muscle cells, or
impair platelet activity.2-4,12
Nevertheless, results from prospec-
tive cohort studies of serum folate and
CVD have been inconsistent; some found
a significant association,13-15 whereas oth-
ers found a weak16,17 or nonexistent18 re-
lationship. We used data from a nation-
ally representative sample of US adults who
were followed up for a median of 14 years
to test whether serum folate concentra-
tions were associated with risk of CVD
mortality independent of established CVD
risk factors. We also tested whether age,14

modified the folate-CVD relationship as demonstrated in
previous studies.
RESULTS
Selected baseline characteristics according to serum fo-
late tertile and diabetes status are presented in Table 1.
There were fewer participants with diabetes in the low-
est tertile compared with the other tertiles. Participants
with diabetes who were in the lowest tertile were more
likely to be current smokers, have less than a high school
education, and drink fewer alcoholic beverages per week
compared with participants in other tertiles (P.05). Par-
ticipants without diabetes in the lowest tertile were
younger compared with participants in other tertiles,
whereas participants in the highest tertile were less likely
to be current smokers (P.05). Other established CVD
risk factors were not significantly associated with serum
folate tertile in either group.
At the end of 12 to 16 years of follow-up, 25 partici-
pants with diabetes had died, 12 of them from CVD. The
RR of dying from CVD or all causes for participants in the
lowest vs highest serum folate tertile appeared to be higher
among participants with diabetes compared with those
without diabetes (data not shown). Risk estimates for this
group are not presented because they were unstable, due
to the small number of participants with diabetes (n=52).
Among participants without diabetes, 122 died dur-
ing follow-up, 49 from CVD (Table 2). Participants with-
out diabetes in the lowest compared with the highest ter-
tile had more than twice the risk of CVD mortality after
adjustment for age and sex (RR, 2.64; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.15-6.09). This increased risk for partici-
pants in the lowest tertile was slightly attenuated after
adjustment for CVD risk factors (RR, 2.28; 95% CI,
0.96-5.40). However, there was no increased risk among
participants without diabetes in the middle compared with
the highest tertile (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.49-1.91). Serum
folate tertiles were not significantly associated with to-
tal mortality, although the age- and sex-adjusted risk was
increased for participants in the lowest compared with
the highest tertile (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.96-3.15).
COMMENT
After following up participants in this probability sample
of the US population for 12 to 16 years, we found a sig-
nificant association between serum folate tertile and CVD
mortality that differed by whether the participant had dia-
betes at baseline. Participants without diabetes at base-
line who had concentrations in the lowest but not the
middle tertile compared with those in the highest tertile
had more than a 2-fold increased risk of dying from CVD.
We found a similar pattern in risk of dying from any cause,
although the magnitude of the risk was not as high as
that for CVD mortality, suggesting that death from CVD
accounts for most of the increased total mortality risk.
Although risk estimates associated with the lowest ter-
METHODS
This study used data from the NHANES II Mortality Study,
a prospective study of participants examined in the Second
NationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES
II) (1976-1980).21 NHANES II collected extensive demo-
graphic, medical history, nutritional, clinical, and labora-
tory data on a multistage probability sample of the civilian,
noninstitutionalized US population.21 Adults 60 to 74 years
of age were oversampled 4 to 1.21 The examination response
rate was 73%.21 The vital status of NHANES II participants
who were 30 to 75 years of age at their examination was as-
certained as of December 31, 1992, resulting in 12 to 16 years
of follow-up. Vital status was assessed by searching the Na-
tional Death Index and the Social Security Administration
Death Master File.22 Cause of death was obtained from the
National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death
file or death certificates and coded according to the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).22 De-
cedents withunderlying causes ofdeathfromICD-9code390
to 459 were defined as having died from CVD.
BASELINE DATA
Blood was drawn from participants at baseline in mobile ex-
amination centers. Serum samples were shipped on dry ice
totheCentersforDiseaseControlandPreventionandstored
at -20°C until analyzed.23,24 Two different assays were used
to measure serum folate concentrations in NHANES II.23,24
A microbiologic method23 was used during the first half of
thesurvey,whereasaradioassay(Quanta-Countfolateradio-
assay kit; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif) was used
during the second half because of quality control problems
with the microbiologic method.23 Previous analysis showed
thattheassaymethodswerenotcomparablethroughoutthe
fullrangeoffolateconcentrations.24 Amorerecentmethodo-
logicstudy25 recommendedtheuseofassay-specificreference

specific tertile cut points to categorize folate status (9.5 and
16.8nmol/Land10.6and16.8nmol/L,microbiologicandra-
dioassay, respectively).
Red blood cell folate concentrations were also mea-
sured in NHANES II, using the same 2 assays as serum fo-
late.23,24 Although red blood cell folate may be a better in-
dicator of long-term folate status, we do not present risk
estimates because a large percentage (26%) of the 899 eli-
gible participants were missing these data. Serum B12
con-
centrations were also measured; however, we do not pre-
sent these data because a nonpurified porcine intrinsic factor
was used as a binder (E. Gunter, e-mail communication,
April 1, 1999), making it susceptible to generating false el-
evations in subjects who were cobalamin deficient.26,27
Blood pressure was measured twice in the sitting po-
sition by a physician using a mercury sphygmomanom-
eter.28 The average of the 2 blood pressure readings was used
in our analyses. Body mass index was calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. To-
tal serum cholesterol was determined using a Lieberman-

unstable and may be unreliable.
Our finding that the association between serum fo-
late and mortality differed by diabetes status is consis-
tent with those from previous studies that show an in-
teraction between diabetes status and serum folate17 or
hyperhomocystinemia.20 Our results concerning adults
without diabetes are consistent with some but not all of
the findings from previous studies that investigated the
link between serum folate and CVD. The only other pro-
spective study17 to examine serum folate and CVD mor-
tality found a 40% increased but nonsignificant risk as-

Burchard reagent.29 Diabetes status was positive if a par-
ticipant reported having been told by a physician that he
or she had diabetes, was using insulin at baseline, had a
2-hour post­oral glucose challenge plasma glucose level
greater than or equal to 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), or had
a fasting plasma glucose level (with no challenge) greater
than or equal to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). At baseline, CVD
was defined as having a history of physician-reported heart
attack or stroke or symptoms of angina, as determined by
a modified Rose questionnaire. Participants were asked to
rate their recreational physical activity as much, moder-
ate, or little or no activity.
STUDY POPULATION
Serum folate concentrations were measured on a 10% ran-
dom sample of NHANES II participants.30 Serum folate data
were missing for 11% of the eligible 899 NHANES II Mor-
tality Study participants primarily because of disruptions
caused by the change in assays. There were few differ-
ences in the distributions of selected baseline characteris-
tics among participants with missing compared with avail-
able serum folate data (data not shown). However, serum
total cholesterol levels were significantly higher (P=.05)
among participants with missing data compared with those
with available data. An additional 2% of participants were
missing data for established CVD risk factors. Finally, an-
other 10.5% were excluded because they had a history of
CVD at baseline. After all exclusions, there were 689 par-
ticipants for the main analyses.
DATA ANALYSIS
Relative risks (RRs) of CVD and total mortality were esti-
mated using Cox proportional hazards models. Person-
years of follow-up for each participant were calculated from
baseline examination to the date of death or December 31,
1992. The proportional hazards assumption was met as
judged by including time-dependent variables in initial Cox
models. The RR estimates were initially adjusted for age
(years) and sex. Multivariate models also included race (Af-
rican American vs other), education level (12 vs 12
years), smoking status (current vs past and never smok-
ers), leisure-time activity level (light, moderate, heavy), al-
cohol consumption (weekly frequency of beer, wine, and
liquor consumption), diabetes status (yes, no), serum to-
tal cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and body mass
index. All analyses were run using SUDAAN31 and sample
weights to account for the complex sample design,21
except those involving time-dependent variables, which
were run without weights using the Statistical Analysis
System.32
Interactions between serum folate concentration and
selected covariates were assessed by including interaction
terms in preliminary multivariate models. There were no
significant interactions with age, sex, race, or alcohol con-
sumption. In contrast, the associations between serum fo-
late tertile and CVD and total mortality differed by whether
the participant had diabetes at baseline (P=.04 and P=.03,
respectively). For this reason, we performed analyses strati-
fied by diabetes status.

sociated with folate concentrations below 9.3 nmol/L
compared with those above this cutpoint using data from
the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. This RR
was lower than that estimated for participants without
diabetes in our study using essentially the same cut-
point (microbiologic) as our lowest serum tertile. An-
other study found a 70% increased risk of dying from coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) among participants with serum
folate concentrations below 6.8 nmol/L compared with
those above 13.6 nmol/L (microbiologic).13 Three other
studies used a combination of CHD incidence and mor-
tality as their end points. Two of these studies16,18 used
lower cut points for their low serum folate group and
shorter follow-up periods than ours, but neither found
a significantly increased CHD risk. The third study,14 based
on data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study, found a more than 2-fold increased CHD risk
among persons 35 to 55 years of age with serum folate
concentrations less than 9.9 nmol/L compared with those
above 21.8 nmol/L (microbiologic). Finally, plasma
folate concentrations were inversely associated with
carotid artery stenosis in a cross-sectional study.1
One limitation of this study is that our measure of fo-
late status is based on a single serum folate concentration.
Serum folate is labile and may not be indicative of long-
term folate status, because it is sensitive to fluctuations in
recent intake and metabolism,4,5 potentially leading to mis-
classification of some individuals. Such misclassification
could have weakened the associations found in this study.
In addition, 2 different laboratory methods were used in
NHANESIItomeasureserumfolateconcentration.Weused
assay-specific cut points for tertiles to reduce potential mis-
classification error arising from the use of 2 methods.
Another limitation is the relatively small sample size.
When combined with the large SEs resulting from the
complex sample design, the small sample may have con-
tributed instability to risk estimates and could account
for the borderline significance among participants with-
out diabetes after adjustment for CVD risk factors. When
we repeated the analysis to include baseline CVD cases,
we found almost identical results that were statistically
significant with a larger sample size and more statistical
power (RR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.02-4.62). Even though in-
clusion of baseline CVD cases, who may have changed
their dietary or other health behaviors as a result of their
disease, could introduce a bias, apparently no bias was
introduced, because the results did not materially change.
The small sample also prohibited stratification by smok-
ing status, so we cannot exclude the possibility of re-
sidual confounding by cigarette smoking. In addition, the
assessment of CVD used to exclude participants at base-
line was based on self-report, which could have biased
our findings in either direction. Finally, mortality was
probably underascertained in the NHANES II Mortality
Study because of the passive methods used,22 resulting
in misclassification of some participants. Because se-
rum folate concentration was unlikely to be related to
such misclassification, risk estimates were probably un-
affected; however, the statistical power may have been
reduced.33 Such a reduction in power could account for
the borderline significant risk associated with the low-
est tertile among participants without diabetes.
Nonetheless, the RR of CVD mortality associated
with low serum folate concentrations among partici-
pants without diabetes was greater than 2 in this study,
which used a nationally representative sample, con-
trolled for established CVD risk factors, and had a rela-
tively long follow-up period. Our finding that the risk
associated with serum folate and CVD mortality differs
by diabetes status needs to be confirmed in larger stud-
ies in which risks can be reliably estimated among adults
with diabetes. Among participants without diabetes, se-
rum folate concentrations below 9.5 or 10.6 nmol/L, us-
ing microbiologic and radioassay methods, respec-
tively, compared with those above 16.8 nmol/L were
associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of dy-
ing from CVD. Our cut points for the lowest tertile are
consistent with estimates of serum folate concentra-
tions needed to prevent an elevation of homocysteine from
other studies: 9.29 and 9.1 nmol/L2 using a microbio-
logic assay and radioassay, respectively. Although the cut
points used in this study were statistically derived, they
suggest that a considerable proportion of the adult US
population between 1976 and 1980 had serum folate con-
centrations that might have increased their risk of dying
from CVD. Given this relatively large proportion poten-
tially at risk, clinical trials are needed to confirm that low
folate status does confer increased CVD risk and to es-
tablish adequate intake and serum concentrations for pre-
venting CVD. If the folate-CVD relationship can be con-
firmed, then we will need to assess whether recent efforts
to fortify the US food supply with folic acid have in-
creased folate intakes and serum concentrations enough
to decrease the proportion at risk of CVD.
