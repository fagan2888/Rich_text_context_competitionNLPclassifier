Background. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the risk of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarc-
tion (AMI) in a large, nationally representative sample of very old men and women.
Methods. We utilized secondary analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Aging. Baseline (1984) in-person interview data were
linked to Medicare hospitalization records for 1984-1991. Subjects were 6,071 noninstitutionalized adults 70 years old or older
at baseline. Hospitalization for AMI was defined as having primary discharge diagnoses containing ICD9-CM 410 codes.
Multivariable proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the epidemiologic risks for all persons, and separately for
women, men, self-respondents, those with no previous AMIs, and those with no history of coronary heart disease.
Results. Of the sample, 357 persons (5.9%; 172 women and 185 men) had at least one primary discharge diagnosis of AMI.
Significant (p < .05) risk factors for being hospitalized with an AMI (adjusted hazards ratios in parentheses) from the pooled
analysis were male gender (1.86), having no more than a grade school education (1.35), atherosclerosis (1.43), hypertension
(1.29), coronary heart disease (1.63), angina (1.60), previous AMI (1.52), diabetes (1.89), and four or more lower body limita-
tions (1.43). The gender-specific analyses, however, revealed that hypertension, angina, diabetes, and lower body limitations
were risk factors only for women, and that having no more than a grade school education was a risk factor only for men.
Conclusion. Men, especially those with low education, women with diabetes, angina, hypertension, or lower body limita-
tions, and either men or women with previous AMIs, coronary heart disease, or atherosclerosis have elevated risks for AMI re-
sulting in hospitalization, and they should be considered for evaluation and monitoring. Current protocols for therapeutic man-
agement should be adopted, and compliance should be encouraged.
ACUTE myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the most trau-
~ matic and costly adverse health events that individuals ex-
perience (1). The majority of AMIs are recognized (age-adjusted
recognition rates in the Framingham Study were 66% for
women, and 75% for men), and nearly all recognized AMIs re-
sult in hospitalization (2). It is estimated that in 1997 approxi-
mately 1.5 million Americans had 2.1 million hospital episodes
for which AMI was listed as the principal discharge diagnosis
(i.e., ICD-9-CM 410 codes) (1). Three fifths of these AMI hos-
pitalizations involved individuals aged 65 years or older, and this
was reflected in discharge rates of 3.7 per 100,000 in 1995
among 15-44 year olds, 49.1 among 45--64 year olds, and 140.5
among those 65 years old or older (3). Mean length of stay for
these AMI hospitalizations also increased with age, from 4.8
days among 15-44 year olds, to 5.8 days among 45-64 year
olds, and to 7.3 days among those 65 years old or older in 1995
(3). The concentration of and greater hospital resource consump-
tion associated with AMIs among those 65 years old or older
will increase until the growing proportion ofthe older adult pop-
ulation plateaus at about 20% by the year 2030 (4). Thus, AMI
hospitalization represents a significant challenge to managing
the health and health care expenditures ofthe nation (5). Further
research on the risk ofAMI among older adults is especially
warranted because AMI is neither an inevitable nor an irre-
versible consequence of aging (6).
M254
While much is known about the risk factors for AMI in mid-
dle-aged men, less is known about the risk factors for AMI in
older adults, especially among older women (7,8). It is gener-
ally assumed that the risk factors for AMI among older adults
are the same as those among younger adults, and include hy-
pertension, angina, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes, older
age, obesity, male gender, disadvantaged socioeconomic status,
family history, left ventricular hypertrophy, alcohol consump-
tion, stress, personality type, lack of social support, sedentary
behavior, heavy physical exertion among those normally seden-
tary, and ecological factors such as time of day, day of week,
and season (6-9). In addition, congestive heart failure (10,11)
and confusion (12) have been reported to be associated with the
risk ofAMI among older adults. Evidence suggests, however,
that the prevalence of the traditional risk factors and their asso-
ciated relative risks are considerably smaller among older com-
pared with younger adults, especially with regard to low and
high density lipid levels (13), diastolic and systolic blood pres-
sure (14), and cigarette smoking (15).
There are also data to suggest that the presentation ofAMI
among older adults is atypical compared to younger adults, and
that this might result in the identification of different risk fac-
tors (10,12,16). Moreover, results from the Rancho Bernardo
Study suggest that there are important gender differences in the
magnitudes of the relative risks for AMI and other ischemic
HOSPITALIZATION FOR ACUTE MI M255
diseases (17-19). Evidence of gender differences in the magni-
tude of the relative risks associated with other coronary dis-
eases has also been reported (20). Therefore, further research
on risk factors for AMI among older adults that explores the
potential for gender differences would seem justified (21).
For this study, we estimated the risks associated with hospi-
talization for AMI using data obtained from the men and
women 70 years old or older who participated in the 1984 base-
line interviews of the Longitudinal Study ofAging (LSOA).
Medicare claims data for calendar years 1984-1991 were used
to identify as cases those LSOA respondents having a primary
hospital discharge diagnosis of AMI. Multivariable proportional
hazards regression was used to model the risk ofhospitalization
for AMI. This design has several major strengths, including ac-
cess to a large nationally representative sample of older elders,
an 8-year prospective cohort design, an extensive array of po-
tential risk factors that are typically available in an in-person in-
terview or community surveillance system, and a sufficient
number ofAMI events to facilitate the examination of impor-
tant interactions among the risk factors and gender (21).
METHODS
Sample and case identification.-The National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) serves as the official federal statistical
source for monitoring health and health services utilization in
the United States and is designed to be fully representative of the
noninstitutionalized civilian population (22). In 1984, 7,527
NHIS individuals aged 70 years or older were selected to partic-
ipate in the LSOA; they received the Supplement on Aging
(SOA) interview shortly after their NHIS interview. The SOA
interview addressed functional status and activities of daily liv-
ing in considerable detail (23). All of the risk factors used in this
article were obtained by self- (90%) or proxy- (10%) report from
the NHIS or SOA interviews. LSOA respondents also consented
to have their 1984-91 Medicare Automated Data Retrieval
System (MADRS) files abstracted. Similarly, vital status and
date of death were determined from a computerized search of
the National Death Index (NDI).
After linking the NHIS, SOA, MADRS, and NDI files, hos-
pital episodes that contained ICD9-CM codes for AMI (i.e.,
410.00-410.92) in the primary discharge diagnosis field were
used to identify cases. This is the same case-identification strat-
egy used in both the Outcomes Assessment Program in Ischemic
Heart Disease (24) and the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project
(25). It is presumed to maximize the sensitivity and positive pre-
dictive value when identifying AMI cases using hospital dis-
charge data. Nonetheless, as a safeguard, a cardiologist (SO) re-
viewed all hospital episodes in which an AMI was coded either
as a primary or a secondary (i.e., second- through fifth-listed)
discharge diagnosis. That review revealed a ratio of 3:1 for pri-
mary to secondary AMI hospital episodes. Only 25% ofthe sec-
ondary AMI hospital episodes contained a primary ICD9-CM
code reflecting cardiovascular disease (i.e., 390.00-429.99), and
the majority of these involved congestive heart failure. This reaf-
firms the appropriateness of relying solely on the primary dis-
charge diagnosis for case-identification in this study of the risk
for hospitalization for an AMI.
Discharge dates were used as the index date for the cases.
For LSOA respondents with more than one hospitalization for
which AMI was the primary discharge diagnosis, the first was
treated as the index event. Elapsed time to the index AMI was
measured in the number of days since the beginning of the ob-
servation period (January 1, 1984). Controls (i.e., those who did
not have a hospitalization for AMI) were censored at either their
date of death or the end of the observation window (January 1,
1992), whichever came first. Elapsed time to the censoring date
was measured in the number of days since the beginning of the
observation period (January 1, 1984). Consistent with previous
epidemiologic analyses of the LSOA, the unweighted data were
used without adjustments for the multistage cluster design,
whose effects have been shown to be negligible (26).
Riskfactor measurement.-Based on an electronic search of
the cumulative Medline database and the data availability con-
straints in the LSOA, the potential risk factors shown in Table 1
(along with their coding algorithms and means or proportions,
by gender) were selected for evaluation. The demographic and
social characteristics included age, gender, race, marital status,
living arrangements, education, income, social support, region,
and population density. Medical history of coronary and related
diseases was measured by markers reflecting positive responses
to a standard series of questions (including lay definitions) elic-
iting the existence of atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary
heart disease, angina, heart attack, stroke, cancer, arthritis, and
diabetes. Obesity was measured by the body mass index (BMI;
kg/m-). Physical functioning was measured by the number of
five lower body activities that were difficult for the respondent
to perform (i.e., walking a quarter of a mile, walking up 10
steps without rest, standing or being on your feet for 2 hours,
stooping, crouching, or kneeling, and lifting or carrying 25
pounds), by a dichotomous marker of having difficulty per-
forming any of four upper body activities (i.e., grasping objects,
reaching out to shake hands, reaching over one's head, or sit-
ting for 2 hours or more at a time), and by a dichotomous
marker ofhaving difficulty performing any of four instrumental
activities of daily living (IADLs; i.e., meal preparation, shop-
ping, money management, and using the telephone). Physical
activity and cognitive impairment were measured only among
the 6,780 self-respondents. A dichotomous indicator of walking
a mile or more at least once a week was used to measure physi-
cal activity, and cognitive impairment was measured by di-
chotomous markers for memory problems or confusion.
Statistical issues.-It was not possible to link each LSOA re-
spondent's interview data to her or his MADRS files. No match
to the Medicare Master Enrollment File was found for 859 re-
spondents (11 %) who had provided Social Security and/or
health insurance claim numbers. Neither Social Security nor
health insurance claim numbers were provided by 597 respon-
dents (8%). Thus, only 6,071 LSOA respondents (81%) could
be considered in this study to have been at risk of having been
hospitalized for AMI, and the main analyses reported were lim-
ited to this subpopulation. Previous sensitivity analyses have
shown that this restriction does not lead to biased results (27).
Multivariable proportional hazards regression was used to
model the risk for being hospitalized for an AMI. Because the
initial list of risk factors (see Table 1) was large, a three-part
model building process was used. First, forward and backward
stepwise methods incorporating several model selection algo-

rithms were used among women. Second, these same methods
were used among men. Third, forward stepwise selection meth-
ods incorporating several model selection algorithms were used
in a pooled (i.e., women and men) analysis. Risk factors identi-
fied in any of these three parts of the model building process
were then included in the main model, and the main model was
estimated separately among women, among men, and in a
pooled analysis of women and men. The main model was also
estimated in three subsets of the pooled sample for sensitivity
purposes: self-respondents; those with no previous AMI; and,
those with no previous history of coronary heart disease (i.e.,
no self-report of either AMI or coronary heart disease at base-
line). All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
software system, version 7.5.3 (28). Standard methods for the
assessment of the statistical assumptions of the multivariable
models were employed (29).
REsULTS
Descriptivedata.-A total of 14,513 hospital episodes were
identified for the 6,071 LSOA respondents whose interview
data could be linked to the MADRS files.AMI was listed as the
primary discharge diagnosis for 440 (3.0%) of these hospital-
izations, representing 357 persons (172 women and 185 men).
Of these cases, 283 (79.3%) had only one AMI hospitalization,
66 (18.5%) had two AMI hospitalizations, and 8 (2.3%) had
more than two AMI hospitalizations. Mean length of stay for
the AMI hospitalizations was 9.6 days, and median length of
stay was 9 days. Both the rate ofAMI hospitalization and the
associated length of stay in this study were consistent with na-
tional data (not shown) for the same period (1).
Model building.-The three-part model-building process
yielded the following results. Among women, talking on the
telephone with relatives during the 2 weeks prior to baseline,
atherosclerosis, hypertension, angina, previous AMI, diabetes,
and lower body limitations were identified as significant (p <
.05) risk factors for being hospitalized for an AMI. Having no
more than a grade school education, atherosclerosis, coronary
heart disease, and previous AMI were identified as significant
risk factors for being hospitalized for an AMI among men .
Male gender, having no more than a grade school education,
talking on the telephone with relatives, atherosclerosis, hyper-
tension, coronary heart disease, angina, previous AMI, diabetes,
and lower body limitations were identified as significant risk
factors for being hospitalized for an AMI in the pooled analy-
sis. Therefore, the main model included the 10 risk factors
found to be significantin the pooled analyses.
Main model analyses.-The first panel of Table 2 contains
the adjusted hazards ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and asso..
ciated p valuesfor the 10 risk factors in the main model that
was derived from the pooled analyses of the 5,982 women and
men who were considered at risk for being hospitalized for an
AMI, and who had complete data (BMI could not be calculated
for 89 respondents). Panels 2 and 3 of the table contain similar
results from estimating the main model separately among the
3,504 at-risk women and the 2,478 at-risk men, respectively. In
the pooled analyses, independent increased relative risks (per-
centages shown in parentheses) of being hospitalized for an

*Excludes respondents withself-reported previous AMI (acutemyocardial infarction) or coronaryheartdisease.
AMI were associated with male gender (86%), having no more
than a grade school education (35%), talking on the phone with
relatives (43%), atherosclerosis (43%), hypertension (29%),
coronary heart disease (63%), angina (60%), previous AMI
(52%), diabetes (89%), and four or more lower body limita-
tions (43%). For women, independent increased relative risks
were associated with talking on the telephone with relatives
(99%), hypertension (67%), angina (99%), previous AMI
(58%), diabetes (142%), and four or more lower body limita-
tions (58%). For men, independent increased relative risks were
associated with having no more than a grade school education
(54%), coronary heart disease (72%), and previous AMI (57%).
It should be noted that six of the differences in the relative
risks between women and men involve more than the achieve-
ment of statistical significance in one gender group but not in
the other. This is intuitively demonstrated by a gender-based
comparison of the adjusted hazards ratios and their confidence
intervals. It was statistically confirmed by the serial introduc-
tion of the appropriate gender-based interaction terms to the
main model estimated among the pooled sample consistent
with standard practices for effect modification (data not shown)
(30). In other words, the relative risks for women associated
with having no more than a grade school education, talking on
the telephone with relatives, hypertension, angina, diabetes, and
four or more lower body limitations are significantly different
from those for men.

LSOA self-respondents, for whom the additional measures of
physical activityand cognitiveimpairment were available.There
are only two notable changes: the increased risk associated with
having contacted relatives by telephone loses its statistical sig-
nificance, although its point estimate is not appreciably altered;
and, an independent decreased risk ofhospitalization for AMI is
associated with being confused. The second panel of the table
contains the results obtained from estimating the main model
only among LSOA respondents with no previous AMI. The ad-
justed hazards ratios shown there are equivalent to those shown
in the first panel of Table2, indicating that the risk of first hospi-
talization for AMI is similar to the risk of subsequent hospital-
ization for AMI. The third panel ofthe table contains the results
obtained from estimating the main model only among LSOA re-
spondents with no previous history of coronary heart disease.
There are only two notable changes: the increased risks associ-
ated with atherosclerosis and four or more lower body limita-
tions lose their statistical significance, although only the latter
point estimate is appreciably altered.
DISCUSSION
The purpose ofthis article was to identify and estimate the
magnitude of risk factors associated with hospitalization for
AMI using the nationally representative sample of very old men
and women in the LSOA (22,23,26). A three-part model build-
ing process resulted in a main model consisting of 10 salient
risk factors. In the pooled analyses, independent increased rela-
tive risks were associated with male gender, having no more
than a grade school education, telephone contact with relatives,
atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary heart disease, angina,
previous AMI, diabetes, and four or more lower body limita-
tions. With the exception of the risk associated with telephone
contact with relatives, these results are generally consistent in
magnitude with extant reports using smaller, local samples of
somewhat younger elders (8). Moreover, the main model was
robust when estimated within the subpopulations of self-re-
spondents, those with no previous AMI, and those with no pre-
vious history of coronary heart disease.
Estimation of the main model within gender strata, however,
revealed important differences in the risk factors and their mag-
nitudes between women and men. Independent increased rela-
tive risks associated with talking on the telephone with relatives
during the 2 weeks prior to baseline, hypertension, angina, dia-
betes, and four or more lower body limitations were observed
only for women. In contrast, the independent increased relative
risk of being hospitalized for AMI associated with having no
more than a grade school education was observed just for men.
Accounting for these gender differences is not entirely straight-
forward, but several warrant further discussion.
The observed gender difference in the risk of AMI associ-
ated with diabetes is consistent with evidence from the
Framingham Study, in which elevated blood glucose levels
(both 125-174 mg/dL and ~ 175 mg/dL compared to < 90
mg/dL) were statistically and clinically significant risk factors
for older women but not older men (7). In addition, other re-
ports have identified a gender difference in the risk of mortality
from coronary heart disease associated with diabetes, and the
competing explanations that have emerged from these studies
may be especially relevant here (17,18,31). The basic finding
from the coronary death studies is that although diabetes in-
creases the risk for men, that risk is disproportionately higher
for women, especially older women (32). Researchers from the
Rancho Bernardo Study (17) suggest that the greater risk of
coronary mortality among diabetic women reflects their com-
parison with a dramatically healthier group of nondiabetic
women, relative to the contrast involving men. Stratified for
gender and diabetes status, Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
the risk of AMI in the present study revealed the same pattern
(data not shown), even after adjusting for all of the other risk
factors shown in Table 2. The Rancho Bernardo researchers
suggest that a similar differential may also exist with respect to
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, such that diabetic
women have dramatically lower HDL levels than nondiabetic
women, when compared with the contrast between diabetic and
nondiabetic men (17). Unfortunately, this suggestion cannot be
explored with data from the present study.
In contrast, researchers from the Framingham Study (31)
suggest that the greater risk for coronary mortality among dia-
betic women reflects the severity of their disease, and their
greater likelihood of obesity and comorbidity. Other data from
the Framingham Study, however, suggest that the gender differ-
ence in the risk ofAMI associated with diabetes may actually
be a function of the differential rates of unrecognized AMI (for
which no hospitalization would result) for diabetic women and
men (33). Although the occurrence of unrecognized AMI
among diabetics is substantial, it is appreciably less among fe-
male (30%) compared to male (41%) diabetics. Hence, the
lower risk in diabetic men may be a function of their greater
likelihood of unrecognized (and thus not hospitalized) AMIs.
These competing explanations emphasize the need for further
research into the mechanisms, biologic and otherwise (21), un-
derlying the diabetes-related gender differences in the risks of
hospitalization for AMI.
The association between education and most components of
coronary heart disease risk is well-established (34). Those with
low educational attainment have adverse risk profiles. What is
unclear is why an increased risk of being hospitalized for an
AMI was observed in this study for men but not women who
had no more than a grade school education. Two competing co-
hort explanations are possible (35). First, all LSOA respondents
were born before 1915. For this birth cohort, the link between
educational attainment and occupational pursuit was operative
primarily for men (36). Thus, men with low educational attain-
ment would have increased the risk of exposure to a variety of
occupational hazards that might stimulate hostile and angry re-
sponses to external stressors, which are known risks for AMIs
(37). Unfortunately, these socially complex issues cannot be ex-
plored further with these data. .
The second cohort explanation involves differential rates of
cigarette smoking by gender and educational attainrrent
(38,39). Data from the Established Populations for the
Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (EPESE) indicate that the
risk of being a current or former regular smoker was 30%
greater among older men with less than an eighth grade educa-
tion compared to older men with more education (40). But
among the older EPESE women, those with more than an
eighth grade education were at a 60% greater risk of being CUf-
rent or former regular smokers compared to older women with
less education. Thus, some of the observed gender difference in
the risk of being hospitalized for AMI that is associated with
HOSPITALIZATION FOR ACUTE MI M259
education may result from the omitted confounder of cigarette
smoking. Prior analysis of data on older adults from the
Framingham Study, however, discounts this explanation be-
cause that study failed to find a significant risk associated with
cigarette smoking among older adults, either in pooled or gen-
der-stratifiedmodels (7).
The risk of being hospitalized for an AMI associated with
talking on the telephone with relatives among women is perhaps
the most interesting gender difference. Confidence in this asso-
ciation is diminished because its adjusted effect in the pooled
analyses was modest, its confidence interval was wide, and the
effect had been expected to be protective. Nonetheless, women
who reported having talked on the telephone with relatives dur-
ing the 2 weeks prior to the baseline interview had nearly twice
the risk of being hospitalized for an AMI over the next 8 years
as did women who had not. Moreover, additional pooled and
gender-specific analyses (data not shown) in which a variety of
multiplicative terms reflecting the number of diseases were in-
troduced into the models shown in Table 2 failed to reduce the
observed risk, indicating that having talked on the telephone
with relativesis not merely a marker for disease compounding.
Although any explanation of the increased risk ofbeing hos-
pitalized for AMI among women associated with having talked
on the telephone with relatives is post hoc and speculative, a
plausible interpretation may exist. It assumes that the increased
risk reflects a combination of monitoring and diagnostic func-
tions performed most often for frail older adults by their chil-
dren or other family members not living in the same household
(41,42). Women are disproportionately represented among frail
older adults, who tend to live alone and experience difficulties
in recognizing and translating signs and symptoms into health
episodes that warrant medical attention. Accordingly, kin rely
on telephone contact to monitor the well-being of the frail older
adult. In the course of that contact, relatives are more likely to
discuss health-related matters with frail older women than men,
assist them in recognizing patterns of signs and symptoms con-
sistent with known medical conditions, and encourage contact
with the health care delivery system. That contact increases the
likelihood of hospitalization.
Two additional issues warrant brief mention. One is the ab-
sence of the effect of age, both in terms of crude and adjusted
hazards ratios. This would appear somewhat anomalous given
the well-known age-related increase in the rate ofAMI hospi-
talization (1,3). The absence of the aging effect, however, prob-
ably reflects the indirect effect of age on more proximal causes
ofAMI hospitalization, such as related coronary heart diseases
and diabetes, which were included in the main model. Indeed,
additional analyses (data not shown), in which age was coded
in years and in which a quadratic term was included, did reveal
significant crude risks, although those risks were fully dimin-
ished by the introduction of the epidemiologic covariates in the
main model. This is consistent with other reports using the
LSOA that have found age-related risks to plateau at about 80
years of age (20).
The other issue that warrants brief mention is the increased
risk of hospitalization for AMI among men. Men had about
twice the risk of women in the pooled analyses. What accounts
for this increased risk is unclear. Clinical factors related to the
appropriateness of hospitalization, differential risk reflecting
socioeconomic-based access to care, and more aggressive diag-
nostic strategies on the part of patients, physicians, and their
families have been suggested as explanations of similar gender
differences in hospitalization rates for congestive heart failure
(20) or for comparable racial differences in hospitalization rates
for cerebrovascular events (43). Recent evidence suggests that
the latter explanation may be most likely in the AMI case (21),
but further research on this possibility is needed.
Before concluding this article, four possible limitations of
this study need to be mentioned. First, because of the reliance
on discharge diagnoses for case identification, this study fo-
cused on the extent of and risk factors for AMI hospitalization,
rather than AMI itself. Some AMIs result in sudden death, and
some AMIs are silent, neither of which would have been cap-
tured in this study.The proportion of AMIs that result in sudden
cardiac death is not well established, with available estimates
generally ranging between 0.10 and 0040 (44). Data from the
Framingham Study and other investigations, however, suggest
that the proportion of coronary deaths attributable to sudden
cardiac deaths declines with age, and that the risk factors for
sudden cardiac death are indistinguishable from those for coro-
nary heart disease [including AMI (45,46)]. The prevalence of
silent AMI in older adults is also not well established (2).
Recent evidence from the Rotterdam Study suggests that
among those who survived an AMI, the prevalence of silent
AMIs might approximate one half of the prevalence of recog-
nized AMIs (47). Furthermore, the prevalence of silent AMIs
increases with age for both older women and older men, with
the prevalence for older women being nearly twice that of older
men (47). Therefore, it is possible that the use of different case-
identification procedures designed to capture AMI-related sud-
den cardiac deaths and silentAMIs might have produced differ-
ent results than those reported here (24,25).
The second limitation of this study is the potential for sur-
vivorship bias (4) to account for the observed differences be-
tween women and men in the risk factors for AMI, and for the
observed differences in the strength of their associations. It is
well known that women generally lag behind men in the mani-
festation of coronary heart disease (6-9). Therefore, it is possi-
ble that men with coronary heart disease who survived to reach
their seventh decade and beyond had fewer and less severe risk
factors for AMI than women of that age. Although the data in
Table 1 generally reflect equivalent disease prevalence rates for
women and men, those data do not address the potential that
the current prevalencerates for older men, but not older women,
had fallen dramatically prior to baseline. To evaluate this possi-
bility, the prevalence of self-reported health conditions was ex-
amined using the 1988 NHIS (data not shown). Each disease
category within the circulation conditions protocol (i.e., is-
chemic heart disease, other heart disease, hypertension, cere-
brovascular disease, hardening of the arteries, and aneurysm)
declined dramatically by age 70 for both women and men, and
although the drop occurred sooner and more sharply for men,
these differences were rather modest (48). Thus, no evidence of
survivorship bias was observed.
A third limitation of this study is that a number of known
risk factors for AMI among younger adults were not available
in the LSOA data, including hyperlipidemia, smoking and alco-
hol consumption, left ventricular hypertrophy, family history of
CHD, and stress. Similarly, the LSOA contains no data about
the use of therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of first or re-
M260 WOLINSKY ET AL.
current AMIs, such as aspirin, beta blockers, or lipid-lowering
agents, which are more commonly used now than they were
during the study period. Other studies have shown, however,
that both low- and high-density lipid levels (13) and cigarette
smoking (15) have rather limited associations with the risk of
AMI among older adults. Indeed, in the Framingham Study
smoking was not a significant risk factor for coronary heart dis-
ease among older adults, and high (i.e., > 90th percentile) total
serum cholesterol was a significant risk factor only among older
women (7). But left ventricular hypertrophy was a significant
risk factor for older adults in the Framingham Study, and there
is some evidence to suggest that it was a greater risk for women
than for men (7). Therefore, it is possible that the absence of
some of these risk factors may have biased the results, and that
the absence of the therapeutic strategies for risk reduction may
make the results less applicable to the current population of
older adults.
Finally,changes in diagnostic procedures or ICD9-CM coding
during 1984-1991 may have introduced bias into the study in-
volving the identification of salient risk factors (21). The intro-
duction of new diagnosticprocedures for AMI could have altered
the shape of the survival curves and resulted in an increase in
ICD9-CM 410 codes, but this was not found (data not shown).
Similarly,upcoding trends associated with the introduction of the
federal prospective payment system could have resulted in a de-
crease in ICD9-CM 412 codes (used for old MIs), but none were
recorded (data not shown).
In conclusion, this study identified demographic, social,
medical, and physical functioning risk factors for hospitaliza-
tion for AMI, and evaluated their magnitude in a large, nation-
ally representative sample of community-dwelling adults aged
70 years or older. Individuals having these risk factors should
be considered for evaluation and monitoring consistent with ex-
isting primary prevention strategies (49,50). Upon diagnosis,
compliance with protocols for the treatment and management
ofAMI should be encouraged (51). Finally, the increased risk
associated with talking on the telephone with relatives suggests
the continuing need for educational programs designed for per-
sons of all ages that address the warning signs and atypical pre-
sentation of AMI in older adults (10,12,16).
