Abstract
The visual search paradigm has had an enormous impact in many fields. A theme running through
this literature has been the distinction between preattentive and attentive processing, which I refer
to as the two-stage assumption. Under this assumption, slopes of set-size and response time are
used to determine whether attention is needed for a given task or not. Even though a lot of
findings question this two-stage assumption, it still has enormous influence, determining decisions
on whether papers are published or research funded. The results described here show that the
two-stage assumption leads to very different conclusions about the operation of attention for
identical search tasks based only on changes in response (presence/absence versus Go/No-go
responses). Slopes are therefore an ambiguous measure of attentional involvement. Overall, the
results suggest that the two-stage model cannot explain all findings on visual search, and they
highlight how slopes of response time and set-size should only be used with caution.

Introduction
The well-known visual search paradigm has had an enormous impact on many aspects of
science. The paradigm was designed to assess the function of visual attention (Neisser, 1963;
Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, 1998) and the operation of early visual cortical areas
(Julesz, 1981; Nakayama & Martini, 2011). But its' subsequent reach has been far wider
than this, and key assumptions about attention derived from an outdated understanding
of the paradigm are used as blueprints for inference in many disciplines.
In the vast majority of visual search studies, performance is assessed with response times.
Typically, the task is to determine whether a target is present or absent. Search slopes that
measure how response times change as more distractors are added to the display are
presumed to assess the speed of the search and whether attention is involved. If the slopes
are around zero, the common assumption is that the target can be detected preattentively,
while if search times increase with set-size, this is considered to reflect that attention moves
around the search array, seeking the target. Even if an overall change in mean is observed, it

is not thought to reflect the operation of attention if slopes are constant. I will refer to this
preattentive or attentive distinction as the two-stage assumption.
A common finding is that when a target differs from distractors on a single feature search
slopes are around 0, reflecting that search is unaffected by the number of distractors in a
display. Conjunction searches where the target shares features with each distractor type often
result in inefficient search where response times (RT's) increase by 10 to 50 ms with each
added distractor item (Wolfe, 1998a).
While this logic is in many ways attractive, note importantly that it is a testable assumption
about visual attention (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, Cave,
& Franzel, 1989). Other models of visual search have been proposed that do not involve the
two-stage assumption, such as parallel models (Eckstein, 1998; Palmer, 1995), serial
exhaustive models (Sternberg, 1975), and models that postulate a race for recognition by
parallel processing of bottom­up and top­down information (Bundesen & Habekost, 2008).
Approaches that assume that observers adapt to the search environment, such as with
Bayesian updating of preferences and biases (e.g. Vincent, 2015) also show promise in
accounting for the operation of visual attention. All these approaches bypass the serial or
parallel distinction (see also Wolfe, 2007).
The Problem
The standard two-stage assumption of visual search is often used to infer facts about visual
attention but many researchers overlook that it is exactly that--an assumption. Slopes of
response times versus set-size are used to decide whether visual attention is involved or not: If
a particular manipulation affects slopes, this is thought to reflect attentional processing, but
unchanged slopes reflect that the manipulation does not affect attention. Note that this is
often taken beyond reason through circular reasoning: If search slopes for a given task are
around 0, the search is considered ``preattentive.'' To determine what is analysed
preattentively, the tasks that lead to flat search slopes simply need to be identified. There
may, of course, be other reasons for the flat search slopes.
A few random examples from diverse fields of how the two-stage assumption is used as
fact rather than conjecture are mentioned here (almost literally picked out of a hat from
among many possible ones). All highlight the contaminating influence of the two-stage
assumption. In visual masking, Argyropoulos, Gellatly, Pilling, and Carter (2013; see
Filmer, Mattingley, & Dux, 2014 for similar assumptions) concluded that object
substitution masking was not obliterated by attention as originally claimed by Enns and
DiLollo (1997), since they found that such masking was not affected by set-size
manipulations. There was little discussion of the reasoning behind the assumption that set-
size effects are indicative of attentional effects. This was simply taken as given. Another
example involves research into the relation of working memory and attention. Woodman,
Vogel, and Luck (2001) investigated interactions of working memory and attention, finding
that added working memory load did not influence set-size effects in visual search. This led
them to conclude that visual search requires minimal working memory resources, inconsistent
with ideas of overlap in function of attention and working memory (e.g. Awh & Jonides,
2001; Bundesen, 1990). Notably, they found a large intercept effect but stated that: ``this
change in intercept implies that the memory task led to a slowing of a process that either
preceded or followed the actual search'' (p. 221), again a conclusion based on the two-stage
assumption. Oh and Kim (2004) subsequently argued that there was dual-task interference in
a task involving spatial visual memory and visual search. Again set-size effects were the key to
reaching this conclusion. Horowitz and Wolfe (1998) investigated the role of spatial memory
2 i-Perception 6(6)
in visual search finding that randomly relocating search items every 110 ms during search did
not modulate set-size effects. They concluded that attention did not keep track of already
searched locations. They did, however, find intercept effects from the reshuffling.
Kristja
´ nsson (2000) questioned their conclusion by modifying their paradigm, but again
the reasoning depended on the slopes, although Kristja
´ nsson noted that intercept
differences could have relevance for attention under other models than those involving the
two-stage assumption. Greenberg et al. (2015) investigated object-based attention arguing
that the attentional priority surrounding a selected object is modulated by search mode as
measured with slopes.
The two-stage assumption is applied to research outside the field of visual cognition.
In clinical psychology, Hahn, Carlson, Singer, and Gronlund (2006) used slopes of
response time and set-size to assess attentional bias to threatening faces. In
neuropsychology, Ashwin, Wheelwright, and Baron-Cohen (2006) investigated the anger
superiority effect in face perception, using slopes to measure attention to facial expression
in Asperger syndrome. In a study of neglect patients, the current author is again guilty.
Kristja
´ nsson and Vuilleumier (2010) used search slopes to argue for a difference in spatial
memory between visual hemi fields, but to their credit they noted caveats regarding
assumptions about attentional involvement from slopes. In the controversial field of action
video-game training (see Boot, Blakely, & Simons, 2011; Kristja
´ nsson, 2013 for critical
overviews), Hubert-Wallender, Green, Sugarman, and Bavelier (2011) stated that search
slopes could be used as a diagnostic tool for measuring influences on attentional
processing from video-game training or experience (see also Castel, Pratt, & Drummond,
2005; Wu & Spence, 2013). In Neurophysiology, the operative characteristics of neurons in
various vision and attention-related brain regions have been assessed under the two-stage
assumption (Cohen, Heitz, Woodman, & Schall. 2009; Jerde, Ikkai, & Curtis, 2011; see also
Chelazzi, 1999). Similar assumptions have been made in neuroimaging research on humans
(Donner et al., 2002; Nobre, Coull, Walsh, & Frith, 2003) . All these studies take the two-
stage model as given. Finally, the two-stage assumption is found in the Wikipedia entry on
visual search, not stated as conjecture, but fact (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Visual_search#Reaction_time_slope, retrieved May 1st, 2015). In sum, the original
theoretical claims that were based on a particular interpretation of visual search data have
been used at face-value as facts about attention, not testable hypotheses.
Findings question the two-stage assumption
It would of course be fine to accept and apply the two-stage assumption had it stood the test
of time. It did, however, not take long for results to appear that did not fit with the two-stage
formulation. Examples are efficient conjunction search (e.g. McLeod, Driver, & Crisp, 1988;
Nakayama & Silverman, 1986; Theeuwes & Kooi, 1994; Wolfe et al., 1989) and set-size effects
where response times decreased with larger set-size (Bravo & Nakayama, 1992; see also Bacon
& Egeth, 1991; Santhi & Reeves, 2004 (Experiment 3); Schoonveld, Shimozaki, & Eckstein,
2007) showing how target salience can increase with more nontargets. The same features have
been found to function very differently depending on context: The spatial layout of identical
features can determine whether search is efficient or not (Enns & Rensink, 1990), and
familiarity strongly affects visual search for the same basic features (Wang, Cavanagh, &
Green, 1994). In the aforementioned study of Horowitz and Wolfe (1998), where search items
were reshuffled around the scene every 110 ms, whether there was in fact a deficit in search
slopes may be irrelevant to the deeper point that the results (and those of Kristja
´ nsson, 2000)
were quite inconsistent with the two-stage assumption. The reshuffling effects were simply far
Kristja
´nsson 3
too small for this, regardless of whether memory was involved or not. Joseph, Chun, and
Nakayama (1997) found that an attention-demanding task presented at center interfered with
presumed preattentive search. Other examples of results that strongly contradict the two-
stage assumption are findings on foraging (Kristja
´ nsson, Jo
´ hannesson, & Thornton, 2014),
analyses of response time distributions (Palmer, Horowitz, Torralba, & Wolfe, 2011,
Kristja
´ nsson & Jo
´ hannesson, 2014; Wolfe, Palmer, & Horowitz, 2010), and of the
distribution of search slopes as a function of task (Wolfe, 1998). Even though leading
theories of attention have responded to these findings (e.g. Wolfe 1994, 2007), the simple
version of the two-stage assumption is still applied to research in diverse areas, as the
examples discussed above show.
Wang, Kristja
´ nsson, and Nakayama (2005) investigated a ``multiconjunction'' search task
where the target could neither be distinguished from distractor based on single features nor
on the basis of top­down feature biases. In a typical example, the target was randomly either
a black disk or a white donut, while the distractors were black donuts and white disks. The
two target types share a feature with both distractor types minimising target saliency.
According to the two-stage assumption, the visual system would treat target and
distractors alike and need to search through the display items one by one, while the only
useful top­down guidance signal is that the target is always the odd-one-out. Many visual
search theories (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989; Treisman & Sato, 1990; Wolfe et al., 1989)
clearly predict inefficient search on such tasks since the primary determinants of visual search
performance are, by these accounts, feature contrasts (preattentive) and top­down biases
toward certain features (attentive). Yet set-size effects were small, or nonexistent in many
examples, indicating that the search was ``efficient'' (Wolfe, 1998a).
Go/No-go measures
There are other ways of assessing visual search performance than response times on a present
or absent (PA) task. Another finding in the aforementioned paper of Wang et al. (2005,
Experiment 4) is less well known. When they changed their multiconjunction search task,
so that observers did not have to respond whether the target was present or absent, but only if
the target was present (and do nothing if no target was absent; a ``Go/No-go'' task, GNG),
search slopes in multiconjunction search actually became negative--search times decreased
with set-size. Even if the task was switched so that observers only responded on trials with no
target, where search slopes should be twice the size of target present slopes under the two-
stage assumption, the slopes were close to zero. Additionally, the intercepts were much lower
(by $50%) than for a PA task with identical search stimuli. Chmiel (1989) found that target
present slopes for conjunction search became flat when the search task changed from
involving a PA decision to a GNG decision as did van der Heijden and La Heij (1982)
who also observed the error rates were lower for the GNG task.
The important point to take from this is that search performance can be very different for
the same search task with only slight modification of response. But, more seriously, this
means that under the two-stage assumption, visual attention operates differently for
identical searches depending on response requirements. Wang et al. (2005) raised another
point worth considering. There may be a task-discrepancy between the present and absent
decisions in typical visual search that gives the target-presence decision precedence over the
absent decision. Only when the observer fails to find a target is the absent decision an option.
Additionally, Chun & Wolfe (1996) suggested that participants tend to be less certain
when they do not see a target and thus examine more of the display before making a
decision. Wang et al. did indeed observe that error rates did not differ for present and
4 i-Perception 6(6)
absent trials for the GNG task. Error rates were, in fact, much lower overall for the GNG
than the PA task (see also van der Heijden & La Heij, 1982). This may be because the GNG
task allows the decision to involve detecting target presence versus absence. Making the
absent or present decisions the primary task under different conditions may therefore be a
way of equating the tasks.
Current experiments
Here the GNG visual search paradigm used by Wang et al. (2005) is revisited (along with the
more traditional PA task) to assess whether the two-stage assumption leads to similar
conclusions about attention from GNG and PA results. To get a relatively wide range of
estimates of PA versus GNG performance, three different tasks were tested (see Figure 1):
(1) Search based on a single feature with four possible targets (black disk, black donut, white
disk, or white donut). Both distractor sets always shared a feature that the target did not
have, so the target was distinguished from distractors on a single feature. For example,
for a black disk target, the two distractor sets were either white disks and white donuts or
white and black donuts.
(2) ``Easy'' multiconjunction search with four possible targets (black disk, black donut,
white disk, or white donut). Either distractor set shared one feature with the target,
but importantly, never the same one so that no single feature ever distinguished target
from distractors. So if the target was a black disk, the distractors would be white disks
and black donuts.
(3) ``Hard'' multiconjunction search with four possible targets (red vertical or horizontal bar,
or green vertical or horizontal bar). Again, either distractor set shared one feature with
the target, so that no single feature ever distinguished target and distractors. If the
target was, say, a red vertical bar, the distractors would be red horizontal and green
vertical bars.
Figure 1. The three visual search tasks that were tested, both with traditional Present/Absent (PA)
responses or Go/No-Go/(GNG) responses (all shown with set-size ¼ 10). Feature search on the left, where a
single feature (brightness) distinguishes target and distractors; ``easy'' multiconjunction search at center
where the target shares one feature with each distractor set and ``hard'' multiconjunction search on the right.
A target is present in all the examples. The target was randomly one of the four possible search items in each
search on a given trial.

Methods
Observers. Eight observers (six male, mean age 31) participated. All had normal, or corrected
to normal vision. One additional participant was excluded because of incomplete data. They
participated in 200 trials under each of nine conditions (The three response conditions: PA,
GNG--present, GNG--absent, tested for the three different search task), 1,800 trials in total.
Equipment. The experimental displays were programmed in C using the VisionShell
software library and presented on an 85-Hz CRT controlled by a 400-MHz G4 Apple
computer.
Stimuli and procedure. Each trial in both tasks started with the presentation of a central
white (56.6 cdm­2) fixation cross. Following a variable interval (1,000­1,500 ms, randomly
determined for each trial), the experimental stimuli appeared. Auditory feedback was
provided on whether the answer was correct or incorrect. The viewing distance was 60 cm.
The search items appeared on an approximately midgray background (33 cd m­2). In all
conditions, set-size was 10, 18, 24, or 32 items determined randomly for each trial.
The search items were equally distributed on an invisible 8 Â 8 grid (cell size ¼ 2.2) with a
slight random position jitter (Æ0.4) within each cell to introduce irregularity. The task was
to determine whether an odd-one-out target was present or not (PA or GNG response,
see below).
Feature search task. The four possible search items were black (0.8 cdm­2) or white (56.6
cdm­2) annuli or black or white disks (see Figure 1, left). The target always differed from
distractors by having a unique feature. The disks and donuts had a diameter of 1.1.
Multiconjunction search task with disks and donuts. The target always shared a feature with
each of the two distractor types (e.g. a white donut among white disks and black donuts; see
Figure 1b center).
Multiconjunction search task with bars of varied color and orientation. The target always
shared a feature with each of the two distractor types (e.g. a red (22.7 cdm­2) vertical bar (size
1.2 by 0.4) among green (27.6 cdm­2) vertical and red horizontal bars (Figure 1).
There were three different response conditions run in counterbalanced order (two 100 trial
blocks for each condition). In a GNG-presence session, observers responded with a keypress
only if the target was present (on 50% of trials) but were told to ``sit and wait'' if the target
was absent, in which case the trial ended after 2000­3500 ms (randomly determined). In a
GNG-absence session, observers responded only if the target was absent. In the PA task,
observers determined whether the target was present or absent by pressing corresponding
keys.
Results and Discussion
(1) Easy Conjunction Search With Discs and Donuts. The response times from the easy
conjunction task are shown in Figure 2 (top). A number of findings should be highlighted.
First, the set-size effect differs by task (slopes and intercepts are presented in Table 1). When
the target is present, the slopes are negative in the GNG task but positive for the PA task.
When the target is absent, the RTs are almost 5 ms larger per added item in the PA task than
the GNG task.
What this means is that under the two-stage assumption, we are forced to very different
conclusions about the attentional requirements of the task. According to standard theory,
this is a conjunction search where the target does not pop-out nor can top-down feature
guidance be applied since the target is not known. The fact that the slopes are very small in
the PA multiconjunction search is troubling for the two-stage assumption on its own since the
6 i-Perception 6(6)
results suggest that the search is ``preattentive.'' But the results from the GNG task are even
harder to account for under the two-stage assumption. Attention seems to be doing
something quite different from what the two-stage assumption dictates. Attention is clearly
not moving from item to item trying to locate the target. Instead, observers are making a
decision that becomes easier as more items are added to the display. More generally, this
means that slopes are an ambiguous measure of visual attention. A three-way analysis of
Figure 2. The response times for the present/absent versus Go/No-go tasks for the three different
searches. Note the difference in scales, which reflect the differences in overall means for the different
conditions. Error bars show the standard errors of the mean.

variance (ANOVA; task, set-size, and target presence versus absence) showed that the main
effect of task was not quite significant (F(1,7) ¼ 3.643; 0.0979; partial 2 ¼ .34), a significant
effect of set-size (F(3,21) ¼ 3.883; p ¼ .0236; partial 2 ¼ .33), and a significant effect of PA
(F(1,7) ¼ 22.45; p ¼ .00211; partial 2 ¼ .76). Importantly, there was an interaction of set-size
and task, showing how the slopes of RT and set-size differ (F(3,21) ¼ 3.338; p ¼ .0389; partial
2 ¼ .34) by response. Additionally, there was a large interaction of set-size and presence
(F(3,21) ¼ 13.74; p < .001; partial 2 ¼ .2). Other interactions were not significant. The error
rates (presented in Figure 3) were very low. Error rates would have to be far larger and
differential by condition for strategy effects, such as speed or accuracy trade-offs to account
for the results.

(2) Hard Conjunction Search With Colored Oriented Bars. The results for the hard
conjunction search are shown in Figure 1 (middle, slopes and intercepts in Table 1).
Again, we are forced to quite different conclusions regarding attention by a slight
modification of the response. There are both large differences in slope and intercept
between the PA and GNG conditions. A three-way ANOVA revealed a large effect of task
(F(1,7) ¼ 16.91; p ¼ .005; partial 2 ¼ .71), of set-size (F(3,21) ¼ 118.1; p < .0012.62; partial
2 ¼ .31), and of target presence (F(1,7) ¼ 162.7; p < .001; partial 2 ¼ .96). There was an
interaction of task and set-size, showing again that the slopes differ by task
(F(3,21) ¼ 3.579; p ¼ .031; partial 2 ¼ .11). Finally, the commonly seen interaction between
target presence and set-size was significant (F(3,21) ¼ 10.53; p ¼ .001; partial 2 ¼ .2). Again,
the two-stage assumption yields a very different conclusion as a function of task since slopes
are the measure of the speed of attentional processing under that account. The error rates
(Figure 3) suggest that speed or accuracy trade-offs are unlikely to account for the results.
They are highest for the target present case in the PA condition. Performance under this
condition may therefore be overestimated, which would mean that the results underestimate
the difference between GNG and PA performance. Note, however, that there may be a slight
difference in slopes between the PA and GNG tasks in the error rates, which may reflect some
differences in speed­accuracy trade-offs. This evidence is not strong, however, and is unlikely
to account for the slope differences seen for the RT data.
(3) Feature Search. The results for the feature search are shown in Figure 1 (bottom;
slopes and intercepts shown in Table 1). Immediately notable is that the response times
time decrease overall with increased set-size. Furthermore, performance is faster for the
GNG task revealing large intercept effects in a feature search task that are solely due to
changes in response method. This difference might reflect changes in strategy during the
visual task itself, since in the GNG task, observers must detect presence or detect absence,
rather than absence being a decision made only when no target is found. A three-way
ANOVA revealed that the main effect of task (PA vs GNG) was not quite significant
(F(1,7) ¼ 3.13 by p ¼ .12; partial 2 ¼ .31). The main effect of set-size was significant
(F(3,21) ¼ 6.48, p ¼ .003; partial 2 ¼ .16), confirming decreased RTs with increased set-size,
as was the effect of target presence versus absence (F(1,7) ¼ 9.14; p ¼ .019; partial 2 ¼ .57).
No interactions were significant. Error rates (Figure 3) were very low and would have to be
far larger and differential by condition for strategy effects, such as speed or accuracy trade-
offs to account for the results.
General Discussion
The results clearly show how slopes are ambiguous measures of visual attention. Three very
different patterns of results are seen for the three different search tasks, but importantly, the
slopes differ as a function of response method. The idea that slopes measure attention derives
from the assumption of a preattentive stage followed by an attentive stage where the search is
carried out. This two-stage assumption therefore leads to differing conclusions about
attentional function from the current results--different conclusions that are based solely
on slight modification of response method. This result shows how problematic strict
adherence to the two-stage assumption can be. The two-stage model and corresponding
slopes should only be used with great caution, and probably should not be used to
determine whether attention is involved in a particular task or not.
It may surprise some readers to see this argument made in 2015. Some may feel that a
straw man has been erected. Others may wonder: ``who cares?'' Findings that the two-stage
assumption cannot account for have been around in the literature since the 1980s
Kristja
´nsson 9
(see examples in Introduction section). But keep in mind that the implicit influence of the
two-stage assumption is still strong as examples described in the introduction show.
Interpretation of research findings is in many cases based on the two-stage assumption
meaning that scientist may draw incorrect conclusions from their results. Arguments made
in many disciplines in recently published papers depend on the assumption that if you do not
modulate slopes of set-size and RT you do not measure attention. What is important
regarding the current results, above other counterexamples to the two-stage assumption is
that the differing conclusions are obtained on tasks requiring identical searches where only
response instructions are changed. Under the two-stage assumption, such instruction
variability should not affect processes connected with the search. Data on the same search
leave us with different assumptions about attention.
What's going on during visual search
Multiconjunction search, results from foraging tasks, analyses of RT distributions or the
distribution of search slopes, along with the findings described in the introduction, argue
against the two-stage assumption. This highlights that the field still has not figured out how
visual search works. Slopes are clearly not a straightforward measure of attention as has been
the dominant view for 35 years.
What are we left with? Rauschenberger (2010, p. 110) questioned the bottom­up or
top­down distinction that is central to the two-stage view, stating: ``It is entirely
conceivable that there is no temporally or spatially localisable final output that
represents the final word in how the brain interprets a given visual input'' and later:
``In this scheme, ``top­down'' and ``bottom­up'' make little sense because there is no
isolated feed-forward volley.'' I agree with Rauschenberger; it may be time to stop
thinking linearly about vision and attention. Rauschenberger points toward the
importance of reentrant processing (Ahissar & Hochstein, 2004; Lamme & Roelfsema,
2000); and feedback connections. These proposals strongly blur any distinction between
``bottom­up'' versus ``top­down'' processing.
Nakayama & Martini (2011) suggested that visual search might be considered a pattern
recognition task. Eckstein (1998) suggested that differences between feature and conjunction
search reflected noisy interactions among different features. Such accounts might, for
example, explain negative slopes, since with more search items there may be more evidence
to base a decision on. Related to this, Wang et al. (2005) argued that perceptual organisation
could play a large role in search; organisation that might be easier with increased set-size. But
these speculations may at best help explain the negative slopes seen here, and at this point, no
concrete theory accounts for all visual search findings.
Visual search may very well be so multifaceted that no single idea will explain all the data.
Nakayama & Martini (2011) discuss many similar points to those that I make, stating that a
new conception of visual search is still ``[. . .] in embryonic form, but discernible is a core
which de-emphasizes canonical detectors, ignores the `binding' problems and allows for very
high level processing to occur very early in time'' (p. 109). In some ways this is akin to the
proposals of Julesz (1981) and his texton theory, although Julesz distinguished between
preattentive and attentive processing stages, which may not fit well with the current
zeitgeist (Awh, Belopolsky, & Theeuwes, 2012; Kristja
´ nsson, 2010; Rauschenberger, 2010).
Alternative models, such as those discussed in the introduction where the two-stage
dichotomy is ignored, may be better fits to this conception. Parallel models have, for
example, been successful in accounting for decreases in RT with increased set-size (Santhi
& Reeves, 2004; Schoonveld et al., 2007).

Conclusions
Most researchers have abandoned strong versions of the two-stage model of visual search and
attention. Nevertheless, it still exerts a strong influence upon many fields in Psychology and
Cognitive Neuroscience. My data argue against this model, and so do many other findings.
Clearly, it should only be used with great caution.
