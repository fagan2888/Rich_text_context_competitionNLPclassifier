Abstract: Previous studies investigating altruistic punishment have confounded the effects
of two independent variables: information transmission (or breach of privacy) and personal
identification (or breach of anonymity). Here we report findings from a brief study in
which participants were asked to respond to a social norm violation (i.e., an anonymous
actor had behaved selfishly in an economic game) by deciding whether to sacrifice their
own endowment to punish this person. A third of the participants were told that their
economic decisions would be made known to another player but could not be identified
(privacy breach condition), whereas another third were informed that their decision as well
as their names would be made known (anonymity breach condition). (The decisions of
control participants were completely anonymous and private.) Participants also justified
their economic decisions and reported their emotional experiences. The results were
participants punished most in the privacy and anonymity breach conditions and least in the
control condition. These findings have implications for existing evolutionary accounts of
altruistic punishment.

Introduction
Past research has shown that anonymity encourages selfish and anti-normative
behavior because anonymity decreases the "social distance" between actor and recipient
(Bohnet and Frey, 1999; Burnham, 2003; Hoffman, McCabe, and Smith, 1996). However,
much of this research has focused on adherence to norms of fairness, for example, norms
about distributing endowed sums of money (Eckel and Grossman, 1996a; Hoffman et al.,
1996). In comparison, less work has examined the effects of anonymity on punishment
behavior. In other words, to what extent are people's decisions to punish others influenced
by their concerns about others being able to identify them?

One study that did address this question of anonymity and punishment was
conducted by Kurzban, DeScioli, and O'Brien (2007). In this study, these researchers
informed participants, prior to making their decisions about whether to punish another
player who has defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game, that either: (a) they would have to
announce their decisions in public at the end of the game, (b) the experimenter would know
their decisions, or (c) their decisions would be kept completely anonymous and
confidential. Kurzban et al. observed increased levels of altruistic punishment (in the form
of participants sacrificing more of their own monetary endowment to penalize non-
cooperative players) when participants expected their decisions to be made public and their
identities revealed.
Kurzban et al.'s (2007) results suggest that earlier findings about the role of
anonymity in adherence to a fairness norm apply also to norms about punishing violators of
those norms. However, their critical experimental treatment (of informing participants that
their economic decisions would be made public, along with their identity) confounded two
separate independent variables: (1) personal identification (or a breach of anonymity), and
(2) information transmission (or a breach of privacy). While a breach of anonymity entails
a breach of privacy, a breach of privacy does not necessarily entail a breach of anonymity.
In the present study, we examined separately the effects of a breach of anonymity and a
breach of privacy on altruistic punishment behavior in the context of a modified third-party
punishment game.
Our main prediction in the present study was that participants would respond to a
breach of privacy (e.g., being told that their names would be kept confidential but that their
decision to punish would be revealed to another player) as though it were also breach of
anonymity (e.g., that they would be personally identified as making this decision). This
prediction is based on the more general evolutionary hypothesis that, in the ancestral past,
once information about a social act was revealed and began to circulate through gossip, the
actor's identity would have likely also been compromised in small-scale hunter-gatherer
societies.
Privacy, anonymity and social behavior
Privacy is not the same as anonymity. Although privacy generally entails
anonymity, anonymity does not necessarily entail privacy (although it is an open question
whether people treat it as such). If someone finds an anonymous diary (i.e., private
notebook) and shares its contents with others, this is a breach of privacy for the author of
the diary, but it is not a breach of anonymity because the author is not identified. However,
if the author of the diary can be identified due to the handwriting, this breach in privacy
would now become also a breach of anonymity.
Several lines of research have shown that anonymity (in the sense of not being
identifiable) often promotes antisocial and anti-normative behavior. For example, Chiou
(2007) had Taiwanese youth respond to three sexual messages (interspersed with six non-
sexual messages) over the computer, in a web camera (low anonymity), personal photo
(medium anonymity), or nickname (high anonymity) condition. Chiou found that
participants' responses to sexual messages were most explicit in the high anonymity
condition, lowest in the low anonymity condition, and moderate in the medium anonymity
condition. Likewise, Silke (2003) observed that public acts of violence by paramilitary
foot-soldiers in Northern Ireland were exacerbated in terms of seriousness and
Anonymity and punishment
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(3). 2008. -489-
aggressiveness when perpetrators took measures to conceal their personal identities
(wearing masks).
On the other hand, recent findings from evolutionary game theory have
demonstrated the importance of social accountability (i.e., indirect reciprocity or reputation
management) for the stabilizing of norm conformity and prosociality (Milinski, Semmann,
and Krambeck, 2002; Nowak and Sigmund, 1998, 2005; Panchanathan and Boyd, 2004;
Semmann, Krambeck, and Milinski, 2004; Wedekind and Braithwaite, 2002; Wedekind
and Milinski, 2000). For example, Milinski et al. (2002) found that when information about
participants' past decisions in an indirect reciprocity game were made known to other
players, contributions to a public good were significantly higher than when participants'
past decisions were unavailable. Moreover, when the opportunity to build a reputation is
available and there are a limited number of potential interactive partners, people compete
for the best reputation through costly (i.e., altruistic) giving (Barclay and Willer, 2007).
One possible explanation for why anonymity often loosens adherence to social
norms is that cues that motivate reputation-enhancing behavior (i.e., cues indicative of
being visible to others) are often absent in "anonymous" settings. Evidence for this
hypothesis comes from several lines of research that have demonstrated increased prosocial
behavior as a result of introducing implicit, social-presence cues (e.g., human-like eyes,
human voice) into an ostensibly "anonymous" setting (Bateson, Nettle, and Roberts, 2006;
Burnham and Hare, 2007; Haley and Fessler, 2005; Kurzban, 2001).
Burnham (2003), for example, devised a Dictator Game experiment with three
conditions--a "no photo" treatment, a "dictator photo" treatment, and a "recipient photo"
treatment. The Dictator Game assigns one player the role of "dictator" and another player
the role of "recipient." The dictator is given a sum of money and must decide how much of
it he/she will share with the recipient. The recipient is simply a passive recipient in the
game and has no sanctioning power over the dictator (cf. the Ultimatum Game). In
Burnham's "no photo" treatment, participants simply performed an anonymous Dictator
Game. In the "dictator photo" treatment, an instant photograph of the dictator was enclosed
along with their decision to the recipient; that is, in this condition participants performing
the role of dictator believed that they could be identified by recipients (which raised the
possibility of interactions outside the laboratory). In the "recipient photo" treatment,
dictators viewed an instant photograph of the recipient prior to their decision; that is, in this
condition, participants performing the role of dictator could identify the recipient of their
action (which introduced social presence cues into the "anonymous" environment). The
outcome was that dictators were most selfish (i.e., they gave the least amount to the
recipient) in the "no photo" (i.e., true anonymity) condition. However, in the two
experimental conditions, there were significantly more equitable and generous offers,
suggesting that both the presence of social cues ("recipient photo") and concerns about
being identified ("dictator photo") promote generous behavior.
Thus, while researchers have investigated the effects of perceived anonymity on
social behavior, it remains unclear the extent to which perceptions of privacy motivate
similar behaviors. In particular, we are not aware of any study that has distinguished
methodologically between a breach of privacy (i.e., knowing that others will learn about
one's actions but that one's identity will be protected) and a breach of anonymity (i.e.,
knowing that others will learn about one's actions and also that one will be identified as the
actor).

Evolutionary accounts of altruistic punishment and the present study
Norms of cooperation and fairness may evolve only when enough people are
committed to punishing norm violations (Henrich and Boyd, 2001). However, punishment
itself represents a second-order public good (Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson, 2003;
Yamagishi, 1986)--i.e., the benefits of punishment can be enjoyed by all members of a
group regardless of individual contributions. Because the act of punishing norm violators is
costly (i.e., one must expend time and energy to punish, and one risks retaliation and
possible injury), it is in an individual's best interest not to punish, so as to avoid the costs
of punishing. Nevertheless, people often do punish norm violators (at least in laboratory
experiments), despite the costs and even when the actions of norm violators do not directly
affect them (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004; Fehr and Gächter, 2002; Henrich et al., 2006).
Gintis (2000) and Henrich and Boyd (2001) have argued that punitive dispositions
evolved through group selection. Henrich and Boyd (2001), for example, presented a multi-
stage model whereby once norms for cooperation and punishment stabilize within a "pay-
off biased" and "weak conformist transmission" population, they may invade other
populations and come to dominant by avoiding costly punishment (see also Boyd et al.,
2003; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, and Fehr, 2003). Another possibility is that individuals
engaging in altruistic punishment were rewarded from third parties (i.e., group members) in
the form of trust (Barclay, 2006), social status (Hardy and Van Vugt, 2006), or
reproductive benefits (Miller, 2000; Smith, Bliege Bird, and Bird, 2003), which made it
beneficial (in the long run) for individuals to punish norm violations.
Reputation-based explanations for altruistic punishment appear to fall short in that
they fail to account for observations of altruistic punishment in anonymous settings, where
there are no ostensible opportunities to build a reputation (e.g., Fehr and Gächter, 2002;
Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004). This kind of altruistic behavior (that occurs between non-kin
in the absence of cues for direct or indirect reciprocity) has been labeled "strong
reciprocity" (Gintis, 2000; Fehr, Fischbacher, and Gächter, 2002) and there are principally
two evolutionary accounts for this behavior. According to Gintis et al. (2003), strong
reciprocity is an adaptive dispositional trait, which evolved through group selection.
According to Burnham and Johnson (2005), strong reciprocity is, by definition,
maladaptive, and they suggest that strong reciprocity (as it has been operationalized in
laboratory experiments) may be caused by inadvertent "triggering" of individual-level
indirect-reciprocity mechanisms under presumably anonymous conditions (referred to as
the "evolutionary legacy hypothesis"; see Haley and Fessler, 2005, for a similar argument).
In the present study, all participants were assigned the role of the "third party" in a
third-party punishment game (a one-shot economic game; see Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004)
and had to decide how much to spend of their own endowment to punish an anonymous
dictator who "selfishly" distributed 0 to an anonymous recipient. We manipulated
participants' perceptions about having their punishment decisions revealed to the
anonymous recipient (privacy breach) vs. having their decisions revealed and their
identities revealed to the recipient (anonymity breach). Participants were randomly
assigned to one of three experimental conditions. In the control condition, participants were
given the impression that their economic decisions would be kept private and their
identities kept strictly anonymous. In the privacy breach condition, participants were told
that the anonymous recipient would hear about their economic decision, but would not
Anonymity and punishment
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(3). 2008. -491-
know their names (thus had no way of identifying them). Finally, in the anonymity breach
condition, participants were informed that the recipient would be made aware of both their
economic decision and their names (and thus could potentially identify them).
No significant difference in punishment behavior was expected between the privacy
breach and anonymity breach conditions. However, altruistic punishment in these
conditions was expected to be greater than in the control condition (i.e., HA
: anonymity
breach = confidentiality breach > control). This prediction follows from the hypothesis that
concerns about reputation are inadvertently activated by the privacy breach cue (despite
ostensible anonymity). Alternatively, participants may strategically reason that their
economic behavior is equally anonymous in the privacy breach and control conditions, and
thus adjust their behavior accordingly. If this is the case, there should be no difference in
punishment behavior between the privacy breach and control conditions, with greater levels
of punishment in the anonymity breach condition (i.e., HB
: anonymity breach > privacy
breach = control).
We also had participants justify their economic decisions in writing and report, by
selecting from a list of emotion terms, those emotions they experienced while making their
decision. In regards to participants' justifications, we expected that participants who
punished the dictator would justify their actions in terms of concerns about fairness and
justice, as suggested by previous findings (e.g., Dawes, Fowler, Johnson, McElreath et al.,
2007; Hoffman et al., 1996). We made no predictions about justifications of non-punishers.
Finally, in regards to participants' reports of their emotional experience, we expected
punishers to report having had experienced the negative social emotions of anger/outrage,
and the positive social emotions of pride/righteousness. From an appraisal perspective,
anger/outrage arises from perceiving a negative event or social transgression as certain,
under human control, and brought about by others (Lerner and Keltner, 2000; Smith and
Ellsworth, 1985). Pride/righteousness is thought to arise from perceptions of the self as
responsible for a positive event or adhering to a social norm (Fessler and Haley, 2003;
Tracy and Robins, 2004). On the other hand, non-punishers were expected to report feeling
the negative social emotions of guilt and shame. Guilt/shame is thought to arise from
perceptions of the self as responsible for a negative (usually interpersonal) event or norm
violation (Baumeister, Stillwell, and Heatherton, 1994; Tangney, Stuewig, and Mashek,
2007; Tracy and Robins, 2006).
Materials and Methods
Forty-two students from Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland (21 females,
21 males; 69% Caucasian Irish, 28.6% Caucasian English, 2.4% Irish/English; mean age =
20.81; min. = 18.42, max. = 36.25) were assigned randomly to one of three experimental
conditions. In all three conditions, participants were instructed that they were the "third
party" in a "three-player economic game." The economic game was said to entail one
player (the dictator) who was to distribute a sum of ten 1 coins between him- or herself
and a second player (the recipient). In other words, this was a Dictator Game in which the
dictator had absolute control over how many coins (if any) the recipient would receive. The
participants were instructed that these two other players were seated in separate rooms and
that the dictator would be making his or her decision in private. In actuality, aside from the
participant there were no other players. [Note that, in the study, the dictator was referred to
Anonymity and punishment
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(3). 2008. -492-
as "distributor" to avoid connotations associated with "dictator" (e.g., "cruel," "tyrant").
Throughout this paper, however, we use the conventional moniker of "dictator."]
As third party, participants were given a total sum of five 1 coins and informed
that every 1 coin they "left behind" (i.e., that they did not take with them) would serve to
"deduct two coins from the dictator's total earnings." (The term "punish" was never used.)
It was emphasized to participants that their decision only influenced the dictator's outcome
and in no way affected the recipient's outcome.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (14
participants in each condition). In the control condition, participants were instructed that
the recipient would not find out about participants' economic decision. In fact, control
participants were told that the recipient was completely unaware that there was a third party
in the game. In the privacy breach condition, participants were instructed that the
experimenter would be disclosing their economic decision to the recipient, but that the
participant's name would not be disclosed; that is, they could not be identified by the
recipient or the dictator. In the anonymity breach condition, participants were instructed
that the experimenter would be disclosing both their economic decision and their names to
the recipient, but their name would not be disclosed to the dictator; that is, the recipient
would be able to identify them, but the dictator could not. It is important to note that for all
three conditions, participants were guaranteed anonymity from the dictator and thus did not
have to fear extra-laboratory retaliation. Also, all laboratory sessions were carried out
identically, aside from the experimental manipulation.
Before participants made their decision, they received a sealed, opaque envelope
with the dictator's decision inside. All participants learned that the dictator kept the entire
sum of money (all 10 £1 coins). Past research has shown that people often construe
distributions less than half the total amount as violation of a "fairness norm" warranting
punishment (e.g., Fehr and Fischbacher, 2004; Pillutla and Murnighan, 1996).
Participants then made their own decisions about how much money they would like
to "leave behind" and thus "deduct" from the dictator. To do this, they were instructed to
place the amount in an envelope marked "third party" and drop the envelope in a slot box
near the door before leaving. Participants were informed that they would not be interacting
with the experimenter or anyone else after making their decisions, but instead could leave
the building as soon as they were done. This was done to mitigate participants' concerns
about interacting with the experimenter and other players after making their decision. After
submitting their envelope, participants completed a brief questionnaire, which asked them
to justify their decision and select from a list of emotion terms "any emotions experienced
when making their economic decision." These included the following emotion terms:
anger, anxiety, guilt, shame, excitement, righteousness, fear or worry, admiration,
contempt, pride, outrage, envy, or none.
After completing this form, participants exited the laboratory with whatever amount
of coins they decided to keep. This provided participants with a clean get away.
Participants did not have to interact with anyone after making their decisions nor did they
communicate with other participants between sessions. Participants were later fully
debriefed about the study over email.

Results
The main dependent measure was the number of coins sacrificed by the participant
to punish the selfish dictator. UK5 was the maximum number of coins that could be
sacrificed.
Figure 1. Distributions of UK used to punish dictator by experimental condition (N = 14 x 3)
Figure 1 presents the distribution of UK used to punish by participants within each
condition. Overall, punishment was observed most often in the anonymity breach condition
(n = 12; 85.7% gave at least 1), although the majority of participants punished the dictator
to some extent within the other conditions as well (n = 10; 71.4%). Instances of 0 were
most frequent in the control (28.6%) and privacy breach conditions (28.6%), while
instances of 5 (i.e., full punishment) were observed most often in the privacy (35.7%) and
anonymity breach conditions (28.6%).
The mean amount used to punish the dictator in the control condition was 1.57 (SD
= 1.65); in the privacy breach condition, the mean was 2.36 (SD = 2.17); finally, in the
anonymity breach condition, the mean was 2.43 (SD = 1.87). This pattern of means was in
the predicted direction. However, to test our main hypothesis (HA
: anonymity breach =
privacy breach > control), we conducted three planned contrast tests: anonymity vs.
privacy, privacy vs. control, and anonymity vs. control. Although comparisons of the
experimental conditions against the control condition failed to reach conventional levels of
significance (t(39) = 1.09, p = .283; t(39) = 1.19, p = .242; respectively), differences were
Anonymity and punishment
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 6(3). 2008. -494-
in the direction predicted by our hypothesis (HA
) and not the alternative (HB
: anonymity >
privacy = control). As predicted, there was no difference between the anonymity and
privacy condition (t(39) = .10, p = .922).
Because we predicted that there would be no difference between the experimental
conditions, we pooled the data from those conditions and ran a t-test, comparing the
combined experimental conditions against the control condition. The results, again, failed
to reach conventional levels of significance (t(40) = 1.33, p = .191; Levene's test for
equality of variance, p = .130). The calculated effect size (ES) of the observed difference
was .45 (with  = 1.82), a "medium" effect size according to Cohen's (1992) ES index,
which suggests a possible Type II error.
When punishment behavior was considered as a dichotomous variable (i.e., those
who punished [1-5] vs. those who did not [0]), a Chi-square analysis revealed that only
in the anonymity breach condition were participants committed to punishing above chance
levels (2(1, n = 14) = 7.14, p = .008) (ps > .10 for the privacy breach and control
conditions). In other words, participants in the anonymity breach condition consistently
punished the dictator, while participants in the other conditions were not consistent.
In terms of gender effects, no specific hypothesis was made. A 3 (condition) x 2
(gender) ANOVA revealed no significant main effect of gender (F(1, 36) = .472, p = .496),
although a condition x gender interaction approached conventional levels of significance
(F(2, 36) = 2.75, p = .077). One-way follow-up tests revealed that this nearly significant
interaction effect may be explained by a significant difference between male and female
participants in the control condition (F(1, 12) = 4.91, p = .047), with females (M = 2.43, SD
= 1.81) punishing to a greater extent than males (M = .71, SD = .95).
Participants' written justifications for their economic decisions were coded by both
the first author and a second rater naïve to the study's hypotheses (Cohen's k = .76; see
Table 1 for justification categories and frequencies). Justifications reflected participants'
rationales for deducting or not deducting money from the dictator. Some participants
provided rationales that related to multiple justification categories. In these cases, multiple
codes were assigned. Table 1 is organized by number of coins used to punish the dictator--
two or more, one, or none. Punishment behavior was divided into sub-categories of "two or
more" and "one" because many participants who gave only 1 to punish felt inclined to
justify why they did not give more money. Participants who gave "two or more," however,
tended to focus on what they did give, rather than what they did not give.
Reasons for punishing included concerns about fairness and justice (90.6%; n = 29)
and feeling bad for the recipient (9.4%; n = 3). (One person invoked a fairness/justice
rationale to justify their not punishing, but they were treated as an outlier and therefore
omitted.) "Feeling bad for the recipient" justifications only occurred in the anonymity (n =
2) and privacy breach (n = 1) conditions. Reasons for not punishing (or not punishing
more) involved the desire for personal gain (42.9%; n = 12), need for money (14.3%; n =
4), having nothing to gain from punishing the dictator (14.3%; n = 4), or not being able to
help the recipient (17.9%; n = 5). Finally, justifications from three participants were
unscorable or merely restated what the dictator had done without elaboration.

Discussion
The results from this brief study were generally supportive of our hypothesis that a
breach of privacy would promote altruistic punishment in a manner similar to a breach of
anonymity due to the reputational consequences it would have been likely to entail in the
ancestral past. Participants in the privacy and anonymity breach conditions sacrificed more
money to punish an anonymous dictator, who allocated 0 to an anonymous recipient, than
participants in the control condition, who were guaranteed privacy and anonymity.
Participants in the privacy and anonymity breach conditions sacrificed, on average, half of
their endowment to punish, while control participants sacrificed about one-third.
Although contrast tests of these differences failed to reach conventional levels of
significance, the pattern of results conformed to our prediction (HA
: anonymity breach =
privacy breach > control), which was inspired by the general evolutionary argument (i.e.,
the evolutionary legacy hypothesis) that it was difficult--if not impossible--to ensure
anonymity in the ancestral past; therefore, the human mind may be biased to respond to a
breach of privacy as though it were a breach of anonymity. Although provisional, these
findings call into question the conclusions of other investigators who promised their
participants anonymity but nevertheless informed these participants that their economic
decisions would be made known to other players (e.g., Fehr and Gächter, 2002).
In terms of the consistency at which participants punished, participants in the
anonymity breach condition consistently punished the dictator, while participants in the
privacy breach and control condition were not consistent. Interestingly, participants in the
privacy breach condition appeared to oscillate between sacrificing none (or a trivial
amount) and sacrificing all of their money to punish. This suggests perhaps that some
participants were responding to the privacy breach cue as though it were a threat to
anonymity (or an opportunity to build a reputation), while others were not. We might
speculate that some participants were able to consciously override concerns about
reputation elicited by the privacy breach cue (by attending to the experimenter's guarantee
of anonymity), while others viewed this condition as offering possible opportunities for
reputational gain. Future research might investigate this possibility using a cognitive load
manipulation.
Despite lower levels of altruistic punishment in the control condition, the majority
of control participants did punish to some extent. There are two competing evolutionary
explanations for this behavior: First, this behavior may reflect behavioral dispositions for
"strong reciprocity" (i.e., dispositions to punish even when there exist no present or future
rewards for punishing) that evolved through group selection (see Fehr, Fischbacher, and
Gächter, 2002; Gintis, 2000; Gintis et al., 2003). Another possibility is that mechanisms
that evolved to maximize individual fitness (e.g., through reputation management) are
inadvertently triggered by cues embedded within the experimental context--cues that may
be reduced, but never fully eliminated by design parameters (see Burnham and Johnson,
2005). For example, in the context of our third-party punishment game, all participants
received information about the existence of two other players (an anonymous dictator and
recipient). Despite being guaranteed privacy and anonymity in the control condition,
information about the existence of these other players may have been sufficient to trigger
concerns about being identified. Future research should certainly investigate this possibility
further.

Unexpectedly, male participants in the control condition were significantly less
altruistic than female participants. This is consistent with the position that women are more
committed to norm enforcement than men (see Eckel and Grossman, 1996b). Another
possibility is that men, more than women, require incentives such as social recognition to
punish, while women are unilaterally concerned about norm conformity (see Iredale, Van
Vugt, Dunbar, 2008, for evidence pertaining to giving behavior). Since there was no
difference between men and women in the other conditions, our findings suggest the latter
explanation to be more plausible.
Participants who punished the dictator primarily justified their actions in terms of
violations of "fairness" and concerns about "justice." For example, a typical justification
for punishing was as follows:
"The unfairness of the [dictator's] decision affected my choice. Had they distributed
the money evenly I would not have taken any of their money away and kept all of
my money. However because they wanted to keep all the money and not give the
recipient any, I did not mind sacrificing some of my money to detract money from
their sum. Were it not for my own self interest I would have left all my money to
leave the [dictator] with no money" (control condition)
The above quotation also highlights the dominant justification for not punishing (or
not punishing more than one could have), namely, the desire for personal gain ("Were it not
for my own self interest..."). Also, a number of participants reported not punishing because
such action would not benefit the recipient in any manner. It is impossible to determine
whether any justifications in the present study, however, were truly motivational or merely
represent post hoc justifications for punishment decisions, since they were not
experimentally manipulated.
Interestingly, although very rare, it was only in the anonymity and privacy breach
conditions where participants reported "feeling bad for the recipient" as justification for
punishing the dictator. One possibility is that by broadcasting one's sympathy for the
"victim" of this social norm violation these participants were capitalizing on the
opportunity to communicate their prosocial posture to the recipient. However, because this
type of justification was uncommonly reported, we can only speculate. Future studies
could examine this possibility further by informing participants that their justifications will
be transmitted to the recipient, in addition to their economic decisions.
Participants were also asked to nominate from a list of emotion terms those
emotions they had experienced when making their economic decision. Limitations of this
emotion-word task include the fact that reported emotional states may be post-hoc
reconstructions or causally epiphenomenal, and also that the list was predetermined and
may therefore have failed to capture other emotions experienced (e.g., "disgust,"
"annoyance").
Despite these important caveats, the negative social emotions of anger/outrage and
positive social emotions of pride/righteousness were, as predicted, reported by participants
who punished. These data on affect are important because emotions are generally
considered by evolutionary scholars to be the proximate drivers behind adaptive behaviors
(see Cosmides and Tooby, 2000; Fessler and Haley, 2003; Frank, 1988). Our findings are
in line with appraisal theorists who argue that anger/outrage arises from perceptions of a
negative event or transgression as certain, under human control, and brought about by
someone external to self (Lerner and Keltner, 2000; Smith and Ellsworth, 1985), and that
Anonymity and punishment

pride/righteousness arises from perceptions of being morally responsible and having chosen
the socially appropriate course of action (Fessler and Haley, 2003; Tracy and Robins,
2004). In the present study, the dictator's transgressive behavior was presented as certain
(i.e., there was no doubt that the dictator was the cause of the event) and deliberate (i.e., the
dictator could have chosen another course of action), which satisfies the appraisal criteria
for anger/outrage. Participants who punished were responsible for their decision, which
was perceived by many to be the "right" course of action--thus, satisfying the appraisal
criteria for pride/righteousness.
Emotion categories of excitement and contempt were also reported by participants
who punished. This was not predicted, but may be explained by the fact that in Western
society "contempt" shares a taxonomic structure with "anger" (i.e., negative/ interpersonal)
and "excitement" shares a taxonomic structure with "pride" (i.e., positive/ active/ reward)
(see Smith and Ellsworth, 1985; Storm and Storm, 1987).
Participants who did not punish (or who punished very little) reported experiencing
guilt more than any other emotion (although whether guilt is an emotion is debated; see
Elison, 2005), as predicted; however, against expectations, shame was not reported by non-
punishers. One possibility is that the conditions for shame were not present in our study.
According to Tracy and Robins' (2004, 2006) appraisal model, guilt and shame both arise
from an internal attribution of responsibility for a negative event or a failure to live up to
social standards (e.g., committing a transgression or lacking desirable qualities). Guilt and
shame, however, differ in that guilt arises from perceptions of the event as unstable,
controllable, and incongruent with global aspects of the self, while shame arises from
perceptions of the event as stable, uncontrollable, and congruent with global aspects of the
self (see also Tangney, 1995; Tangney et al., 2007). If this is correct, we might speculate
that non-punishers failed to report shame because they perceived their decisions to be
strategic (i.e., controllable) and not emerging from a stable, enduring characteristic of the
self (e.g., the self as "selfish" or "undesirable"). Future studies could test this possibility
more systematically by comparing the justifications of guilt-prone and shame-prone
individuals' for punishing or not punishing.
It is important to point out, of course, that unlike in the ancestral past, contemporary
industrial society provides mediated-communication technologies (such as telephones,
radios and computers) that make possible a specific type of anonymity--"visual
anonymity"--that was not present in the ancestral past. Visual anonymity entails being
invisible to one's interactive partner (or having one's interactive partner invisible) during
social exchange (see Joinson, 2003). Visual anonymity entails invisibility, but it does not
necessarily entail anonymity (in the sense of "not being identifiable"). When people
communicate over the telephone or computer (for example, by Instant Relay Chat), they do
so under visual anonymity. They cannot be seen, but they may be identified (e.g., by their
voice, or deliberately disclose their name). Future research should investigate the extent to
which evolved human psychological systems are co-opted by (or respond to) these social
artifacts of contemporary technologies, as well as determine the fitness value of such
responses in these evolutionarily novel contexts.
