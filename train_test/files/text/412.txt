Objective. To compare antioxidants and other novel and traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in
participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and non-RA controls in a large population sample.
Methods. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III) was a cross-sectional population
survey in which subjects ages >60 underwent a musculoskeletal examination. RA subjects were defined as those who met
>3 of 6 available 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Non-RA subjects were defined as those who met
no ACR criteria. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of the association between RA and each novel and
traditional CVD risk factor in RA versus non-RA subjects.
Results. The sample included 5,302 subjects ages >60, with 131 (2.5%) RA and 4,444 (84%) non-RA participants. A total
of 727 subjects were excluded. Plasma levels of antioxidants -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lyco-
pene were significantly lower in RA subjects compared with non-RA subjects in multivariate analysis adjusting for
potential confounders. Compared with non-RA participants, RA subjects were more likely to have increased C-reactive
protein (CRP) levels in multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounders. RA and non-RA participants had
similar prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors and previous CVD.
Conclusion. In this large population study, RA subjects had similar prevalence of previous CVD and traditional CVD risk
factors as controls. Among novel CVD risk factors, plasma carotenoid levels were significantly lower and CRP level was
significantly higher in RA compared with non-RA subjects after adjustment for potential confounders. Further research
should evaluate whether these differences account for the observed increased incidence of CVD in individuals with RA.

INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common systemic,
chronic inflammatory, autoimmune disease, is associated
with excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is
not entirely explained by traditional risk factors for car-
diovascular disease (CVD) (1­4). Novel risk factors for
CVD including inflammatory biomarkers, antioxidants,
and/or vitamins may contribute to excess CVD in persons
with RA.
RA and atherosclerosis share common inflammatory
mechanisms (5,6). There is an association between inflam-
matory markers and subsequent CVD in healthy subjects
(7­10). Therefore, chronic systemic inflammation may
contribute to the higher incidence of CVD in persons with
RA (11­14).
Moreover, there is a complex relationship between in-
flammation, antioxidant vitamin status, and the risk of
CVD. Previous reports have demonstrated inverse associ-
ations between inflammation and antioxidant serum lev-
els, in particular carotenoids (15­17). Furthermore, in-
takes of antioxidant vitamins and other micronutrients or
their serum concentrations, including carotenoids (18­
20), vitamin C (21­23), vitamin E (24,25), and folate and
homocysteine (26­28), have been reported to be inversely
associated with CVD incidence and mortality.

An inverse association between vitamin D levels and
CVD risk and risk factors has been suggested based on the
biologic effects of vitamin D, which include immuno-
modulatory effects (29,30), antiproliferative effects on
myocardiocytes (31,32), and effects on the renin­angioten-
sin system (33,34). Thus, in the context of a chronic in-
flammatory disease, deficiency of antioxidants and/or vi-
tamins may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis
in persons with RA. The objective of the present study was
to compare novel risk factors for CVD, including inflam-
matory biomarkers, antioxidants and vitamins, and tradi-
tional CVD risk factors, between subjects with RA and
subjects without RA in a large cross-sectional survey of the
US population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Data source. Data were derived from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III).
NHANES-III was conducted between 1988 and 1994 to
assess the health and nutrition of a large representative
sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion. The sampling frame was as a multistage, stratified,
clustered survey to ensure representativeness (35,36). All
participants provided informed consent. No personal
identifiers were included. Data including demographic
characteristics, signs and symptoms of RA, traditional
CVD risk factors, history of cardiovascular events, and
information on prescription drug use were collected
through an interview in the participants' homes. All inter-
viewed persons were invited for a medical examination
performed by a physician at the mobile examination center
(MEC), where blood samples were also obtained. The mus-
culoskeletal examination was performed for subjects ages
60 years.
Demographics. Demographic information included age,
sex, race, marital status, educational level, and poverty
index. The poverty index is defined as a ratio of family
income to the national poverty threshold, as determined
annually by the US Census Bureau, age of the family
reference person, and calendar year in which the family
was interviewed (35,36). Education was coded as the num-
ber of years of formal education completed.
Novel risk factors for CVD. A priori, we considered
biomarkers including levels of antioxidants and vitamins,
inflammatory biomarkers, and lipoproteins as novel risk
factors for CVD (37). We examined serum levels of anti-
oxidants/vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vita-
min E, -carotene, -carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/
zeaxanthin, and lycopene), homocysteine, folate, and in-
flammatory biomarkers (serum C-reactive protein [CRP]
level, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, platelet volume,
and hemoglobin). Serum CRP level was categorized as
undetectable (22 mg/dl), detectable (0.22­1 mg/dl), and
elevated (1 mg/dl) as previously defined (16). Fasting
blood samples were tested for lipids (serum triglycerides,
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] choles-
terol, and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol), li-
poproteins (lipoprotein[a], apolipoprotein A-1, apoli-
poprotein B), and biomarkers considered as novel
potential risk factors for CVD (37).
Traditional risk factors for CVD and previous CVD. A
priori, we considered smoking, diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, family history of premature myocardial in-
farction (MI), obesity/body mass index (BMI), and seden-
tary lifestyle as traditional CVD risk factors. Smoking sta-
tus was assessed during the household interview.
Respondents were classified as never smokers (100 cig-
arettes in their lifetime), former smokers (100 lifetime
cigarettes, not currently smoking), and current smokers
(100 lifetime cigarettes, currently smoking). Information
on pack-years of smoking was also recorded. Diabetes was
defined as a fasting plasma glucose level 126 mg/dl, the
presence of a 2-hour glucose tolerance test result 200
mg/dl (the 2-hour glucose tolerance test was performed
only among subjects ages 60­74 years not receiving insu-
lin), or self-report of a physician diagnosis. Blood pressure
was measured 3 times during the home interview and 3
times during the physical examination. Mean blood pres-
sure was calculated by using all available systolic and
diastolic readings. Hypertension was defined as mean sys-
tolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood
pressure 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medica-
tions. Dyslipidemia was defined by use of medications to
treat hypercholesterolemia, fasting total serum cholesterol
level 240 mg/dl, or LDL cholesterol level 160 mg/dl, or
by self-report of high cholesterol. Framingham risk score
was also calculated for all subjects (38). History of stroke,
MI, and congestive heart failure was obtained by self-
report of a physician diagnosis. Information on current use
of postmenopausal hormone (PMH) and use of vitamin or
mineral supplements was obtained by self-report. Nutrient
intake was estimated from a 24-hour dietary recall (36).
Alcohol consumption was determined from a food fre-
quency questionnaire. Physical activity was based on lei-
sure-time physical activity in the past month (39) and was
reported in metabolic equivalent units. Sedentary lifestyle
was defined by denial of any leisure-time physical activity.
Anthropometric measures such as body weight, height,
and waist and hip circumferences were obtained from
physical examination. BMI was calculated as weight (in
kg) divided by the square of height (in meters). Waist
circumference was measured at the level of the high point
of the iliac crest and hip circumference was measured at
the level of maximum extension of the buttocks. The
waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist circum-
ference divided by hip circumference (in cm).
Assessment of rheumatoid arthritis. RA was defined
based on the 1987 American College of Rheumatology
(ACR; formerly the American Rheumatism Association)
criteria for classification of RA using self-report of morning
stiffness, objective findings of synovitis from physical ex-
amination, and positive rheumatoid factor (40). Radio-
graphs of the hands and wrists were obtained in all sub-
jects older than 60 years, but interpretation of the
954 de Pablo et al
radiographs was not available at the time of this study.
Therefore, 6 of the 7 ACR criteria for RA classification
were available.
Participants who met at least 3 of 6 available ACR cri-
teria were defined as having RA as previously described
(41­43). Briefly, a recent study identified subjects with RA
in NHANES-III (41) by applying the "n of k" rule (40)
identifying subjects with 3 of 6 ACR criteria. Recent RA
studies used these methods to define RA cases in NHANES
(42, 43). Participants who met no ACR criteria were de-
fined as non-RA subjects. Subjects who met 1­2 ACR cri-
teria were excluded from the analysis.
Medication data. We assessed use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral corticosteroids, and
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Infor-
mation on medication use in the last month was based on
self-report of a prescription (41).
Statistical analysis. Summary statistics are presented as
the mean  SD for continuous measures and frequencies
for all discrete variables. First, we compared RA subjects
with non-RA subjects. Second, we compared seropositive
RA individuals with seronegative RA individuals in a
subset analysis. We used multivariate linear and logistic
regression models for each novel and traditional CVD risk
factor, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex.
Multiple linear regression was used to determine
whether the level of antioxidant micronutrients was inde-
pendently associated with RA. In addition to age, race/
ethnicity, sex, poverty index, and education, these models
were adjusted for known determinants of antioxidant mi-
cronutrient levels including vitamin intake, carotenoid in-
take, total caloric intake, BMI, total cholesterol, HDL,
smoking, diabetes, PMH, and alcohol consumption. Carot-
enoid intake was entered in the multivariate model as a
continuous variable. An exploratory model further ad-
justed for CRP level.
Multivariate linear regression models were used to de-
termine whether the level of biomarkers was indepen-
dently associated with RA. The analyses were conducted
among subjects with complete information on each bio-
marker. The models were adjusted for age, race, sex, smok-
ing, diabetes, BMI, PMH, WHR, alcohol intake, previous
CVD, poverty index, and education.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine
whether a given traditional CVD risk factor was associated
with RA, adjusting for potential confounders including
smoking, PMH, alcohol intake, diabetes, BMI, WHR, pre-
vious CVD, poverty index, and education. Finally, to eval-
uate to what extent differences in physical activity or
antiinflammatory medications explain differences be-
tween RA and non-RA subjects, sedentary lifestyle and
physical activity and/or medications were entered in the
multivariate models.
We used Stata software (StataCorp, College Station, TX)
survey data commands and applied NHANES-III weights
to all analyses. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant. Formal alpha adjustments were
not performed (44­46).
RESULTS
Among 5,302 subjects ages 60 years who had examina-
tion variables, 131 (2.5%) met 3 of 6 ACR criteria for RA
and 4,444 (84%) subjects were defined as non-RA controls.
A total of 727 subjects were excluded. Sociodemographic
characteristics and clinical factors are described in Table
1. RA participants were slightly older than controls
(mean  SD age 74  8 years versus 72  8 years; P 
0.006). RA subjects were more likely to be taking NSAIDs
(P  0.001) and DMARDs (P  0.001) than non-RA sub-
jects. Seropositive RA participants were more likely to be
taking DMARDs (P  0.03) but not NSAIDs (P  0.3) or
steroids (P  0.4) compared with those with seronegative
RA. Hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in RA
subjects compared with non-RA subjects (mean  SD
13.3  1.6 gm/dl versus 14  1.4 gm/dl; P  0.006).
Among novel risk factors for CVD, the plasma levels of
antioxidants were significantly lower in RA subjects com-
pared with non-RA subjects, specifically carotenoids such
as -carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and -crypto-
xanthin, in age-, race-, and sex-adjusted models (Table 2).
This association remained significant with further adjust-
ments in the multivariate model for smoking; alcohol con-
sumption; BMI; PMH; total cholesterol; HDL; and vitamin,
carotenoid, and energy intake. An exploratory model fur-
ther adjusting for CRP level attenuated the difference but
results remained significant. Overall, carotenoid intake
was significantly correlated with carotenoid plasma levels
(P  0.001).
There was no difference in the plasma concentration of
-carotene and vitamins A, C, D, and E (Table 2). In con-
trast, RA participants had higher levels of inflammatory
markers such as fibrinogen (mean  SD 352  114 mg/dl
versus 331  90 mg/dl; P  0.1) and CRP level (0.9  1.4
mg/dl versus 0.6  1.0 mg/dl; P  0.01). RA participants
were significantly more likely to have clinically elevated
CRP levels in multivariate analysis adjusted for age, race,
and sex (odds ratio [OR] 3.1; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI] 1.6, 5.8), and with further adjustment for educa-
tion, poverty income ratio, smoking, BMI, WHR, PMH,
diabetes, alcohol intake, and previous CVD (OR 3.2; 95%
CI 1.4, 7.2) (Table 3). A model further adjusting for phys-
ical activity and medications yielded similar results (OR
2.9; 95% CI 1.2, 6.9). RA subjects tended to have slightly
lower plasma concentrations of lipids, lipoproteins, homo-
cysteine, folate, and red blood cell folate than non-RA
subjects, but none of the differences were significant in
multivariate models (Table 3). In a subset analysis limited
to participants with RA, seropositive subjects were more
likely to have elevated CRP levels in age-, race-, and sex-
adjusted analysis (OR 10.2; 95% CI 3.3, 31.8) and multi-
variate analysis (OR 14.6; 95% CI 2.3, 91.6) compared with
seronegative RA subjects.
RA participants tended to have a slightly higher preva-
lence of hypertension (70% versus 62%), dyslipidemia
(43% versus 34%), diabetes (28% versus 26%), family
history of early MI (10% versus 9%), and sedentary life-
style (40% versus 29%) than non-RA individuals (Table
4). However, these differences were not significant after
adjustment for potential confounders. Framingham risk
Antioxidants and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in RA 955
score was similar among RA and non-RA participants
(20% versus 19%). None of the differences in smoking,
previous CVD, BMI, WHR, and leisure-time physical ac-
tivity were statistically significant (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
Among novel CVD risk factors, the levels of antioxidants
-carotene, -cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lyco-
pene were significantly lower in RA participants com-
pared with non-RA participants in this large population-
based study. These associations remained significant after
adjustment for known and potential confounders. CRP
level was significantly higher in subjects with RA. Further-
more, seropositive RA subjects were more likely to have a
higher CRP level than seronegative RA subjects. Partici-
pants with RA in NHANES-III had a similar prevalence of
traditional CVD risk factors and personal history of CVD
compared with non-RA controls.
Our findings of lower antioxidant micronutrient levels
in RA compared with non-RA participants may be ex-
plained by inflammation. Several studies have demon-
strated inverse associations between inflammation and
plasma concentrations of carotenoids and retinol (15­
17). An inverse relationship between markers of inflam-
mation and antioxidant levels has been observed among
individuals with RA (47). A prospective cohort study of
women found an inverse association of -cryptoxanthin
with risk of RA (48) and a recent population-based study
reported an inverse association between intake of
-cryptoxanthin and risk of inflammatory polyarthritis
(49), suggesting that intake of certain antioxidant micro-
nutrients may be protective against the development of
RA.

Antioxidants and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in RA 957
The lower antioxidant concentrations among partici-
pants with RA may have resulted from lower intake of
antioxidants, increased metabolism of antioxidants, or
both. Adjusting for dietary nutrient intake is helpful in
establishing how much of the antioxidant deficit may be
attributable to inadequate intake of antioxidants. After ad-
justing for nutrient intake, subjects with RA still had lower
concentrations of antioxidants. This finding suggests that
increased metabolism of antioxidants probably results in
the reduced antioxidant concentrations found among par-
ticipants with RA.
Previous studies have demonstrated that plasma carot-
enoid concentrations are reflective of dietary intake (50­
54). The magnitude of the correlation varies depending on
the specific carotenoid and the dietary assessment tool
(55). Overall, there was a significant correlation between
carotenoid intake and carotenoid plasma levels. Lower
plasma concentrations of the carotenoids -carotene,
-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, and lycopene in RA
subjects compared with controls persisted after controlling
for age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes,
BMI, PMH, total cholesterol, HDL, vitamin, carotenoid,
and energy intake, suggesting that RA may cause an in-
creased metabolic turnover of antioxidants.
Cigarette smoking is a dose- and time-dependent risk
factor for RA (56). Smoking also affects the serum concen-
trations of antioxidant micronutrients (57). Therefore, re-
sidual confounding by smoking is a concern. However,
adjusting for smoking using pack-years did not alter the
results (data not shown).
Controlling for CRP level attenuated the difference be-
tween the groups but results remained significant. The
inflammatory process in RA, through the production of
reactive oxygen species, may deplete stores of antioxi-
dants, but we cannot rule out other causes such as de-
creased intake, decreased absorption, or transport of anti-
oxidant micronutrients in subjects with RA. Nevertheless,
a low antioxidant status might increase the potential for
oxidative damage. Several epidemiologic studies have
found inverse associations between serum carotenoid lev-
els and CVD (18­20). The magnitude of the reduction has
ranged from only small decreases to a more than 50%
reduction in risk (18). In addition, cohort studies of dietary
carotenoid intake and CVD found a lower risk of coronary
events in individuals consuming greater amounts of caro-
tenoids (58,59). Plasma levels of lycopene are inversely
related to risk of ischemic stroke (19), risk of MI (60), and
risk of atherosclerosis (61­63). In general, the epidemio-
logic evidence suggests that a diet rich in high carotenoid
foods is associated with a reduced risk of CVD. Further
research should evaluate the causal pathway of the lower
carotenoid levels in RA and whether they account for the
observed increased incidence of CVD in patients with RA.
An inverse association between CVD risk and CVD risk
factors and low levels of vitamin D has been suggested
(64­66). Low intake of vitamin D and low serum levels of
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly predictive of
acute MI and stroke when adjusted for age, sex, smoking,
and functional capacity in a recent study of subjects older
than 65 years followed up for 10 years (67). Furthermore,
in a cohort of elderly women, a greater intake of vitamin D
had an inverse association with incident RA (68). How-
ever, we did not find differences in vitamin D concentra-
tions between RA cases and controls.
The inflammatory markers CRP and fibrinogen are asso-
ciated with CVD and its severity (7,10,69), and it has been
postulated that atherosclerosis and RA share common in-
flammatory mechanisms (5,6). CRP level was significantly
higher in subjects with RA, which is expected given the
inflammatory nature of the disease. CRP is an acute-phase
protein produced by the liver in response to interleukin-6.
Evidence suggests that CRP has atherosclerosis-promoting

§ Diabetes was defined by the presence of a fasting plasma glucose level 126 mg/dl, presence of a 2-hour glucose tolerance test result 200 mg/dl
(performed only among subjects ages 60­74 years not receiving insulin), or self-report of a physician diagnosis. The multivariate logistic regression
model was adjusted for age, race, sex, smoking, body mass index, postmenopausal hormone, waist-to-hip ratio, alcohol intake, poverty index, and

¶ Blood pressure was measured 3 times during the home interview and 3 times during the physical examination. A mean blood pressure was calculated
by using all available systolic and diastolic readings. Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood
pressure 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive medications.
# Dyslipidemia was defined by use of medications to treat hypercholesterolemia, fasting total serum cholesterol level 240 mg/dl, or low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level 160 mg/dl, or by self-report of high cholesterol.

CRP levels are associated with RA disease activity and
severity, which has been associated with CVD mortality
(73,74). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that
CRP level is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in
patients with RA and inflammatory polyarthritis, indepen-
dent of disease severity (75). Therefore, chronic inflamma-
tion in RA may lead to accelerated atherosclerosis, which
in turn may be responsible for the higher incidence of CVD
in patients with RA (11­14,76).
Conventional risk factors for CVD appear to account for
approximately 80­90% of all coronary heart disease
events in the general population (77,78). However, previ-
ous studies have demonstrated that RA is associated with
excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is not
entirely explained by traditional risk factors for CVD (1­
4). A recent prospective study found that women with RA
had a significantly 2-fold increased risk of MI compared
with those without RA, adjusting for age, traditional risk
factors, oral glucocorticoid use, NSAID use, and intake of
folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin E supplements (2),
suggesting that the disease itself is responsible for in-
creased risk. In a recent retrospective cohort study, pa-
tients with RA were twice as likely to experience unrec-
ognized MI and sudden deaths compared with non-RA
subjects. Also, patients with RA were less likely to have
symptoms of angina and were less likely to receive coro-
nary artery bypass graft, suggesting that CVD manifests
differently in RA (79). Patients with RA may have altered
lipid profiles as a result of the rheumatoid inflammatory
process (80); however, the adverse lipid profiles associated
with active RA have been shown to improve substantially
following effective treatment of RA without the use of
lipid-lowering agents (81). In the present study, we did not
find altered lipid profiles in RA participants, and in con-
trast to previous observations of excess cardiovascular
morbidity in persons with RA, the prevalence of CVD in
RA participants was similar to non-RA controls. Similarly,
the prevalence of traditional risk factors for CVD in sub-
jects with RA was similar to non-RA controls, in contrast
to previous studies suggesting that patients with RA may
have a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors com-
pared with subjects without RA (82­87). The results are in
agreement with the findings of a recent study of the dis-
tribution of known CVD risk factors in women participat-
ing in the Nurses' Health Study, where most traditional
CVD risk factors were similar between women with RA
and controls. However, as expected, biomarkers of inflam-
mation associated with CVD were generally elevated in
women with RA (88). Advantages of our study include the
population-based design, inclusion of both women and
men, and the evaluation of novel risk factors for CVD
including antioxidant levels.
Strengths of the present study include the weighted
estimates that were generalizable to the US population at
the time of NHANES-III. In addition, this is the first pop-
ulation-based study examining the prevalence of novel
and traditional CVD risk factors in RA. Also, the RA case
definition was based on findings on physical examination
for ACR criteria for classification of RA based on a previ-
ously described method for case definition in NHANES-III
(41­43).
The analyses of associations between novel and tradi-
tional CVD risk factors and RA involved multiple tests of
significance. A potential limitation relates to multiple test-
ing, because multiple comparisons are associated with an
increased chance for a Type I error. However, the utility of
formal adjustments for multiple comparisons in an epide-
miologic context has been questioned (44­46). We there-
fore chose not to perform any formal alpha adjustments in
the present study, but we acknowledge the need to con-
sider with caution the statistical significance of such asso-
ciations.
The definition of RA was based on objective criteria
(40,41). However, our findings may not be generalizable to
younger individuals with RA because the study sample
included subjects ages 60 years or older. Misclassification
is possible because RA diagnosis was not confirmed by
medical record review. Indeed, the use of ACR criteria that
rely on the presence of signs and symptoms of disease may
lead to an underascertainment of RA cases (89,90). For
instance, persons with severe RA could have been missed
because they were unable to attend the MEC evaluations or
chose not to participate. Similarly, participants in a period
of inactive, mild, or early disease may not have fulfilled a
minimum of 3 ACR criteria for RA. We excluded partici-
pants with 1 or 2 ACR criteria from the analyses to reduce
this misclassification.
Seropositivity was present in 27% of this population
sample, suggesting that seronegative RA may be overrep-
resented in this sample, or it may be that the case defini-
tion captured a less severe disease with inflammatory
polyarthritis. However, a similarly low prevalence of rheu-
matoid factor has been described in other recent samples
(91­93). Moreover, given that RA joint deformity is not
part of the ACR criteria, subjects with inactive disease at
the time of the examination who had joint deformity could
have been misclassified as controls. In a sensitivity analy-
sis, we excluded all controls with hand deformities and
the results were unchanged.
In this large population study, the prevalence of tradi-
tional CVD risk factors in RA cases compared with con-
trols was similar. Among novel CVD risk factors, CRP level
was significantly higher, and antioxidant levels were sig-
nificantly lower in RA subjects compared with non-RA
subjects. Further research should evaluate whether antiox-
idant differences account for the observed increased inci-
dence of CVD in persons with RA.
