OBESITY IS A SERIOUS MEDI-
cal problem, increasing in
prevalence, affecting mil-
lions,1 and of great inter-
est to the public. To articulate the bur-
den of obesity, investigators have used
indicators such as prevalence,1,2 eco-
nomic cost,3 and association with risk
factors and diseases.4 However, there is
little published scientific information
on the number of annual obesity-
attributable deaths in the United States.
Mass media,5-8 scholarly journals,9-11
and pharmaceutical handouts12 have
cited 300 000 deaths per year in the
United States as being attributable to
obesity, a number that may have been
adapted from an analysis of precursors
of premature death in the United States
for 1980,13 attributing 289502 deaths to
"overnutrition." McGinnis and Foege14
estimated that, of US deaths in 1990,
309000 to 582000 were associated with
unhealthy diet and exercise patterns.
However,neitherstudyestimateddeaths
attributed specifically to obesity.
We report a detailed analysis aimed
at calculating the annual number of
deaths attributable to obesity. It is im-
portant to clarify the quantity we are
trying to estimate.
Ifwechooseaparticularyear,ie,1991,
we can say, "Of the people who were
aliveatthebeginningof1991,howmany
fewer would have died by the end of that
year if all of the obese people alive at the
beginningoftheyearhadnotbeenobese
and if those people had the hazard of
those with a BMI [body mass index] just
below the cutoff for obesity (eg, BMI
23-25 kg/m2)." For simplicity, we refer
to this quantity as "the annual number
of deaths attributable to obesity."
METHODS
The year 1991 was chosen for analysis
because of the availability of popula-
tion (1990 US census15) and mortality
statistics.16 Also, it was the midpoint of
data collection for the Third National

Context Obesity is a major health problem in the United States, but the number of
obesity-attributable deaths has not been rigorously estimated.
Objective To estimate the number of deaths, annually, attributable to obesity among
US adults.
Design Data from 5 prospective cohort studies (the Alameda Community Health Study,
the Framingham Heart Study, the Tecumseh Community Health Study, the American
Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study I, and the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study) and 1 published study (the Nurses'
Health Study) in conjunction with 1991 national statistics on body mass index distri-
butions, population size, and overall deaths.
Subjects Adults, 18 years or older in 1991, classified by body mass index (kg/m2) as
overweight (25-30), obese (30-35), and severely obese (35).
Main Outcome Measure Relative hazard ratio (HR) of death for obese or over-
weight persons.
Results The estimated number of annual deaths attributable to obesity varied with the
cohort used to calculate the HRs, but findings were consistent overall. More than 80%
of the estimated obesity-attributable deaths occurred among individuals with a body mass
index of more than 30 kg/m2. When HRs were estimated for all eligible subjects from all
6 studies, the mean estimate of deaths attributable to obesity in the United States was
280 184 (range, 236 111-341 153). Hazard ratios also were calculated from data for non-
smokers or never-smokers only. When these HRs were applied to the entire population
(assuming the HR applied to all individuals), the mean estimate for obesity-attributable
death was 324 940 (range, 262 541-383 410).
Conclusions The estimated number of annual deaths attributable to obesity among
US adults is approximately 280 000 based on HRs from all subjects and 325 000 based
on HRs from only nonsmokers and never-smokers.

vey (NHANES III17), which provides the
most recent, detailed population-
based overweight and obesity-
prevalence data.
Method of Calculation
We use formulae similar to the con-
ventionalformulaeforattributablerisk18
but account for "complications." First,
BMI exists along a continuum, and
there is no single or universally ac-
cepted threshold above which people
are labeled obese or overweight. Sec-
ond, because persons go from being
alive to dead over some time frame, use
of relative risk (RR) estimates from
studies without adjustment for time can
bias results (though the bias may be
small). The classes of quantities in-
volved in calculation of number of obe-
sity-attributable deaths are described
below and in TABLE 1.
Definitions of Overweight or
Obesity and Reference Category
These quantities are the BMI thresh-
olds used to define obesity and a
nonoverweight reference category. We
use T1
(T for threshold) for the lower
BMI limit of the reference group and T2
for its upper BMI limit; T3
is the BMI
value above which subjects are catego-
rized as overweight or obese. There are
many thresholds that could be used for
overweight or obese categorization and
many possible reference groups. We
used a BMI range of 23 to 25 kg/m2
for the reference category, a close-to-
average range corresponding to the up-
per end of current standards for accept-
able weight.19,20
Calculations were based on integer
values of T3
from 25 to 30 kg/m2 ("over-
weight"),30to35kg/m2 ("obesity"),and
greater than 35 kg/m2 ("severe obe-
sity")--cut points used by the World
Health Organization (WHO)19 and the
National Institutes of Health (NIH).20
The hazard of mortality for those with
BMIsgreaterthanorequaltoT3
canthen
be compared with those of the refer-
ence group.
Population Characteristics
These quantities are estimated di-
rectly from existing data and describe
the target population of interest. The
target population is defined as adults
(18 years or older) in the United States
in 199115 (total population size is N
[185 105 441]). Total number of deaths
in the target population in 1991

 The hazard for a person in the reference category (ie, BMI T1

*BMI indicates body mass index; HR, hazard ratio.
An equivalent formulation to that given at right is  = A(P(O)) (P(D|O))N, where A is the population-attributable fraction defined as (RR-1)/RR and RR is the relative risk defined as
P(D|O)/P(D|R). We subtract from M the number of deaths expected to occur if all obese people had been in the reference category (the total number of deaths that currently
occur). The number of deaths expected to occur if all obese people had been in the reference category is equal to the total population size (N) times the overall probability of
deaths, which is a mixture of probabilities as given in the equation.

Data Sources for Estimation of HRs
We used several data sources to evalu-
ate the extent to which results obtained
weresensitivetoaparticulardataset.Cri-
teria used to select the data sets in-
cluded (1) US source; (2) public avail-
ability or availability via extraction from
published reports (ie, HRs for BMI cat-
egories); (3) not derived predomi-
nantly from ill, high-risk, or elderly
subjects;and(4)well-documentedchar-
acteristics. We chose 6 large prospec-
tive cohort studies meeting these crite-
ria: the Alameda County Health Study,21
the Tecumseh Community Health
Study,22 the Framingham Heart Study,23
the American Cancer Society's Cancer
Prevention Study I,24 the Nurses' Health
Study,25 and the NHANES I Epidemio-
logic Follow-up Study26 (TABLE 2). In-
stead of including every possible study
that met the inclusion criteria, we fo-
cused on a few, readily accessible key
studies, representing a relatively broad
cross-section of studies, with which we
analyzed the sensitivity of our results to
derivation cohort.
ALAMEDA COUNTY
HEALTH STUDY
The Alameda County Health Study21
followed 6928 persons selected in 1965
(response rate, 86%) to represent the
noninstitutionalized adult population
of Alameda County, California. Data
included self-reported sociodemo-
graphic information (eg, age, sex, eth-
nicity, height, weight) and physical,
cognitive, psychological, and social
functioning.21,27 Of the original 6928
subjects, 6794 (98%) were used in our
analysis. Sample racial and sociodemo-
graphic composition is representative
of that in large, industrialized cities.21
FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY
The Framingham Heart Study, initi-
ated in 1948 to assess prospectively car-
diovascular disease risk factors among
a two-thirds sample of the residents of
Framingham, Mass,23 consisted of 5209
persons (response rate, 68.8%) be-
tween 28 and 62 years of age at entry,
with all subjects examined biennially
since study inception. Data collected in-
cluded age, sex, measured height and
weight, physical examination, and ex-
tensive cardiovascular history.28-30 Of
the original 5209 subjects, 5166 (99%)
were used in our analysis. Subjects were
typically white and middle-class, with
educational attainment comparable to
that of the general population.

AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY
CANCER PREVENTION STUDY I
The American Cancer Society Cancer
Prevention Study I24 (CPS1) was con-
ducted by questionnaire on more than
1 million male and female volunteers
30 years of age or older in 26 states. En-
rollment extended from October 1959
to March 1960, and data collected
included sociodemographic infor-
mation, smoking status, and self-
reported height and weight. Partici-
pants were followed through September
1971 (98%) and September 1973
(93%). Subjects were predominantly
white and middle-class, with an aver-
age level of educational attainment
higher than that of the US population.
Participants were classified as never-
smokers if they reported that they had
never smoked cigarettes regularly. A to-
tal of 829 636 subjects (of whom
469 149 were classified as never-
smokers) were used in our analyses.
To assess the sensitivity of the re-
sults relative to the baseline health sta-
tus of the cohort, we analyzed the pub-
lished data from the CPS1 cohort as
reported by Stevens et al33 because of
the elimination from analyses of cur-
rent and former smokers and subjects
who, at study inception, reported poor
health or history of heart attack, stroke,
or cancer (other than skin cancer). Af-
ter exclusions, 314 135 (62 116 men
and 252019 women) subjects who were
never-smokers and reported no preex-
isting disease remained.
NURSES' HEALTH STUDY
The Nurses' Health Study25 (NHS) was
established in 1976, when 121 700 fe-
male registered nurses 30 to 55 years of
age completed questionnaires on medi-
calhistory,heightandweight,andhealth
behavior. The subjects, 98% white, re-
sided in 11 US states. The participation
rate was more than 50%, fewer than 3%
did not report height and weight, and
mortality follow-up rate was more than
98%. The investigation of body weight
andall-causemortalityreportedbyMan-
son et al34 that provided the data herein
wasbasedoninformationabout115195
women without diagnosed cardiovas-
cular disease or cancer in 1976 who re-
ported height and weight. The cohort
was followed for 16 years, and relation
of BMI to hazard of death was deter-
mined in all participants and in never-
smokers. Using proportional-hazards
analysis, Manson et al34 determined the
HR of dying for 7 BMI categories (19
kg/m2,19-21.9kg/m2,22-24.9kg/m2,25-
26.9 kg/m2, 27-28.9 kg/m2, 29-31.9 kg/
m2, and 32 kg/m2), with the leanest
group as the referent. They expressed
HRsasage-adjustedandadjustedfornu-
merous potential confounders (eg,
smoking, menopausal status, oral con-
traceptive and postmenopausal hor-
mone use, and parental history of myo-
cardialinfarctionbeforeage60).Manson
et al34 also adjusted for alcohol intake,
saturated fat intake, and physical activ-
ity; however, HRs for these adjust-
ments were virtually identical to those
obtained with age- and smoking-
adjustment only.
NHANES I EPIDEMIOLOGIC
FOLLOW-UP STUDY
The NHANES I Epidemiologic Fol-
low-up Study26 (NHEFS) was de-
signed to investigate relationships be-
tween clinical, nutritional, and
behavioral factors assessed in NHANES
I and subsequent morbidity, mortal-
ity, and functional limitation. This co-
hort is nationally representative of the
US civilian noninstitutionalized popu-
lation and includes all 14 407 persons
who completed the medical examina-
tions at baseline (1971-1975). Fol-
low-up vital statistics were collected
through 1992. Of the subjects, 96%
have been successfuly traced at some
point through the 1992 follow-up, and
91% to 96% of those traced completed
the follow-up interview.26
Statistical Methods
for Estimation of HRs
For each raw data set, the log of the HR
of death from any cause was regressed
on dummy codes for BMI categories de-
fined by chosen thresholds: age (in-
cluding polynomials of age as needed),
sex, and dummy codes for smoking sta-
tus (any missing data on smoking were
imputed for NHEFS) using Cox pro-
portional hazards regression.35 In the
5 raw data sets, proportionality assump-
tion was checked and validated. Inter-
actions of age and sex with BMI terms
were not included because of our in-
terest in estimating the average effect
of overweight or obesity across both
sexes and all adult ages. Although it is
interesting to examine how obesity ef-
fects differ by age, sex, race, and other
factors, the purpose of this article is to
estimate total societal obesity burden
in terms of mortality. However, our
analysis does take into account differ-
ential effects of obesity by age and sex
despite no corresponding interaction
terms, simply by including both sexes
and a cross section of ages in the deri-
vation samples. For example, if there
were an equal number of men and
women in a sample with equal obesity
rates by sex, and the RR of death given
obesity was 2.0 in men and 1.5 in
women, the estimated RR for the com-
bined group would be 1.75; using this
RR for the whole sample combined, we
would get the same answer as if num-
ber of attributable deaths in women and
men were calculated separately and
added together. The differential effect
of variations in BMI on mortality rate
in different sex, age, and race groups
has been described.33,36 As per Man-
son et al,37 various health problems or
risk factors such as hypertension that
are partially due to obesity were not in-
cluded in models because it is inappro-
priate to control for aspects of health
considered intermediaries on the causal
path from obesity to mortality.
As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated
all analyses using data from only cur-
rent nonsmokers (or never-smokers
when data were available), because it is
suggested that smoking status may con-
found the BMI-mortality relationship
and that analyses of never-smokers yield
the most valid estimates34,37 (see "Com-
ment"section).Earlydeathswerenotex-
cluded as has sometimes been advo-
cated,38 in part because there is no

Contrarily, it was shown mathemati-
cally that the technique is not guaran-
teed to reduce bias due to occult dis-
easewhensuchbiasispresentandcould
even exacerbate such bias.39 Also, simu-
lations show that, under plausible sce-
narios of confounding due to occult dis-
ease, excluding early deaths may have
little meaningful impact on results aside
from reducing power and precision and
can increase bias.40 A meta-analysis in-
volving nearly 2 million subjects found
that, in practice, excluding early deaths
has little discernible effect on the BMI-
mortalityrelationship.41 Nevertheless,in
sensitivity analysis herein, this tech-
nique is used in conjunction with sev-
eralothermethods,becausecertainpub-
lished data on which we draw are based
on this technique.
For the published summary statistics
from the NHS cohort, we used estab-
lished "dose-response" methods to esti-
mate HRs for our BMI categories.42 The

*Negative values for a body mass index (BMI) category occur when the estimated hazard ratio in that category is less
than 1.0. Were such values statistically different (none were), this would imply that these BMI levels were "protective"
relative to a BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2. Alternately, these negative values may represent random fluctuations owing to
sampling variation.

BMI categories. These functions were
based on simple linear interpolation be-
tween observed values and, for the high-
est BMI category, extrapolation from the
slope between the penultimate and an-
tepenultimatevalues.TheHRsusedwere
age-adjusted to maintain consistency
with the raw data analyses of the 5 co-
hort studies. Mean BMI for each of our
established categories was calculated
from NHANES III data and used to es-
timate the HR within each category us-
ing the derived functions. We used the
same procedure on the published statis-
tics from the CPS1 subjects who were
never-smokers, reported no preexist-
ing disease, and no substantial weight
loss.33
RESULTS
TABLE 3 presents the inputs obtained
for the 6 sets of analyses. For each
BMI category, the probability of being
in that category, P(CAT), is given as
derived from NHANES III data. Also,
for each BMI category within each
raw data set, the adjusted HR and
95% confidence intervals are given as
derived on all subjects and for non-
smokers or never-smokers. The HRs
generally increased with BMI, but
elevation above 1.0 is not clear and
consistent until BMIs reach the upper
20s. Also, although there is a tendency
for HRs to be greater when calculated
on nonsmokers only, the difference is
slight and inconsistent, concurring
with past research.43
The top half of TABLE 4 provides
numbers of deaths attributable to obe-
sity in the United States in all subjects
in each BMI category for each data set
and the sum of all categories above a
BMI of 25 kg/m2. Negative values for a
BMI category occur when an esti-
mated HR is less than 1.0. Should sta-
tistically significant differences be found
(none were) this would imply that the
BMI levels were "protective" relative to
a BMI of 23 to 25 kg/m2. Alternately,
these negativevaluesmayrepresentran-
dom fluctuations because of sampling
variation. The overall values, how-
ever, are consistent among data sets.
Across the 6 cohorts, the mean esti-
mate of the annual number of obesity-
attributable deaths was 280 184 (range,
236 111-341 153).
The bottom half of Table 4 presents
data based on HRs for nonsmokers only.
The values estimated are not the num-
ber of deaths due to obesity in only non-
smokers or never-smokers. Rather, they
are estimates of the number of deaths
due to obesity in the total population
consisting of both smokers and non-
smokers or never-smokers, assuming
that HRs for obesity calculated on non-
smokers or never-smokers only offer
the best estimates of HRs for all sub-
jects, regardless of smoking status (see
"Comment" section). The overall pat-
tern was similar to HRs derived for all
subjects. However, in the higher BMI
categories, HRs tended to be higher in
nonsmokers or never-smokers, ex-
pressed as larger numbers of attribut-
able deaths in the higher BMI catego-
ries. Overall values are fairly consistent
with a mean estimate of 324 940 an-
nual deaths attributable to overweight
or obesity (range, 262 541-383 410).
There are many possible ways to de-
rive HR estimates for obesity effects. We
have chosen 2 potentially conservative
approaches, using all subjects or using
nonsmoking or never-smoking sub-
jectsonly.However,theseapproachesdo
not account for potential confounding
fromothersources(eg,prevalentchronic
disease,unintentionalweightloss,weight
fluctuation). As a final set of sensitivity
analyses, we used HRs from analyses of
the 2 largest cohorts, the CPS1 and the
NHS, in which there were efforts to con-
trolforthesevariablesbyexcludingthose
whose weight fluctuated, those with os-
tensible ill health at baseline, and those
who died early during follow-up. Based
on published CPS1 statistics, we esti-
mated that 330 324 annual deaths are
attributable to overweight or obesity;
using published NHS statistics, we esti-
mated that number to be 418 154.

mated the annual number of deaths at-
tributable to obesity to be about
280 000. The mean estimate based on
analyses of HRs measured in nonsmok-
ers or never-smokers was about 325000
and that found using HRs from osten-
sibly healthy, weight-stable nonsmok-
ers or never-smokers was about
374 000. Among BMI categories exam-
ined, the largest proportion of deaths
attributable to overweight or obesity
(more than 80%) occurred in persons
with BMIs of at least 30 kg/m2. During
the NHANES III survey, about 40.5 mil-
lion Americans (about 22% of adults)
had BMIs at that level.
In 1990, an analysis by Hahn et al44
of excess mortality in the United States
due to 9 chronic conditions involving
the Framingham and El DuPont de
Nemours data sets estimated that obe-
sity contributed to 261 988 deaths.
However, deaths attributable to obe-
sity were calculated only from coro-
nary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and
diabetes; other chronic diseases were ig-
nored and potential protective aspects
of obesity, especially in the elderly (eg,
hip fracture reduction), were not con-
sidered.
Distributions of age, sex, smoking,
health status, ethnicity, and socioeco-
nomic status in a cohort can affect the
estimated HR. For example, Stevens et
al33 found that HR for obesity de-
creased steadily with advancing age.
Hence, if cohort age distributions vary,
this disparity could yield different av-
erage HRs associated with BMI. Meth-
odological factors can also affect the
BMI-mortality association and may con-
tribute to the variation in our results, eg,
there are possible effects of differing
follow-up durations, although there was
no clear association between follow-up
duration and magnitude of estimates
among the cohorts examined.
Our primary analyses, adjusting only
for sex, smoking, and age, may pro-
vide conservative estimates of annual
number of deaths attributable to obe-
sity and do not control for confound-
ing from prevalent chronic disease at
baseline or residual confounding from
cigarette smoking, both of which are as-
sociated with lower body weight and in-
creased mortality. Thus, these analy-
ses may underestimate risks of excess
weight. In analyses controlling for these
variables (using CPS1 and NHS data),
mean annual number of deaths attrib-
utable to obesity was estimated to be
374 239.
Smoking has received much atten-
tion in BMI and mortality analyses. In
Table3,HRsofnonsmokerswhoseBMIs
exceeded29kg/m2 weregenerallyhigher
thanthoseofacombinedgroupofsmok-
ers and nonsmokers; were higher in the
CPS1 after exclusion of subjects with
possible preexisting illness; and were
highest in the NHS, a relatively healthy
group without cancer or cardiovascu-
lar disease. Because some evidence sug-
gests that smoking and preexisting ill-
ness confound the obesity-mortality
relationship,34,37 we separately esti-
mated attributable deaths using HRs cal-
culated from all subjects and nonsmok-
ers or never-smokers and performed
a sensitivity analysis involving osten-
sibly healthy, weight-stable never-
smokers. The exclusion of subjects with
a potentially confounding trait yields
HRs free of confounding by the trait, but
validity of application of the HRs to a
mixedpopulation(withandwithoutthe
trait) cannot be known with certainty.
The differences observed between
analyses based on HRs from all subjects
vs those from nonsmokers or never-
smokers prompts the question, "Which
of the estimates presented is more rea-
sonable?" If one is prepared to believe
that in self-defined smokers, there is no
variation in the degree to which per-
sons are exposed to those components
of cigarettes that influence both body
weight and mortality rate (ie, all smok-
ers smoke an identical amount in an
identical way or at least that the classi-
fication into smokers and nonsmokers
reasonably captures the biological
mechanism[s] by which smoking influ-
ences mortality rates), then there is no
residual confounding by smoking after
controlling for it statistically or by strati-
fication. In this case, best estimates of
BMI's causal effect on mortality rate will
comefromasampleofbothsmokersand
nonsmokers (top part of Table 4). Al-
ternately,ifoneispreparedtobelievethat
the causal effect of BMI on mortality rate
is identical for all levels of smoking sta-
tus (ie, no interaction or effect modifi-
cation), then samples of never-smokers
should give more unbiased estimates of
the true effect of BMI on mortality rate,
evenformixedpopulationsconsistingof
both smokers and nonsmokers (bot-
tom part of Table 4). Finally, for those
who think there may be both residual
confounding among smokers and ef-
fectmodification,thebestestimatesmay
lie between the top and bottom parts
of Table 4. Similar comments apply to
exclusion of individuals whose weight
fluctuates or who are apparently un-
healthy. With respect to whether
residual confounding or effect modifi-
cation is likely, the literature is di-
vided.20,37,43 The results of our analysis,
both with and without smokers, sug-
gests that there is some effect modifica-
tion or residual confounding. However,
the effect of eliminating smokers from
the data set does not seem to be a low-
ering of risk in the very lean nor a low-
ering of the BMI mortality curve nadir,
butratheraslightincreaseinobesityhaz-
ard relative to average-weight persons.
We have no way of knowing whether
residual confounding or effect modifi-
cation is the more likely explanation.
There are several limitations of the
current analysis that may point to fu-
ture investigations. We analyzed BMI
at a single point in time only, and it
would be interesting to evaluate mor-
tality as a function of BMI changes. Also,
our calculations assume that all (con-
trolling for age, sex, and smoking) ex-
cess mortality in obese people is due to
obesity. However, it is not definitively
established that if currently obese per-
sons were to lose weight or were to
never become obese, they would not
still have a higher mortality rate. Also,
our estimates may be biased toward
higher numbers due to confounding by
unknown factors. Given these consid-
erations, studies of the potential mor-
tality-reducing effects of intentional
weight loss by medically advisable pro-
cedures in obese persons would be of

great benefit. Also, we chose BMI cut-
offs for overweight and obesity used by
the NIH and WHO. Had we set the BMI
thresholds higher, the number of at-
tributable deaths would have been re-
duced. Alternately, had we relied only
on studies in which the BMI-mortality
association increases in a monotonic
(not "U-shaped") manner34 and set ei-
ther the threshold for overweight and
the reference category lower, the num-
ber of attributable deaths would have
increased substantially.
Regarding generalizability, our esti-
mates are national estimates for the
overall population of US adults, be-
cause the BMI distribution on which
our calculations are based is derived
from a nationally representative sample
(NHANES III). Therefore, the overall
estimates will be valid for the US adult
population to the extent that our HR
estimates, which in only 1 case are
based on a nationally representative
sample, are valid estimates for the US
population. Most of our samples over-
represent whites and may have over-
represented middle- and upper-
socioeconomic status subjects. The sole
nationally representative sample
(NHEFS) yielded slightly lower esti-
mates than the others. Our estimates are
also best applied to 1991. For 1999 and
beyond, 2 factors are likely to increase
the number of obesity-attributable
deaths: continued growth in popula-
tion size, and the apparently continu-
ing increase in both the population pro-
portion that is obese and severely
obese.1 Indeed, this latter trend im-
plies that our approach to calculating
risks in BMI categories (vs a continu-
ous model) with older data sets prob-
ably underestimates the total number
of deaths due to obesity in general and
in the highest BMI category in particu-
lar. However, this may be offset by the
fact that when most of the cohort stud-
ies used were initiated, there were fewer
intervention strategies to reduce risk
factors associated with obesity and
fewer medical therapies for postpon-
ing death from obesity-related dis-
eases. An increase in the efficacy and
availability of such interventions would
reduce HRs associated with obesity.
Our estimates are limited to a soci-
etal rather than individual perspective.
It would be interesting to use BMI-
mortalitydatatocalculateexpectedyears
of life lost for the individual. In such an
analysis by Stevens et al,45 this way of
viewing the burden of obesity showed
that moderate obesity generally results
in a 1- to 3-year reduction in life expec-
tancy, depending on age. It would also
be interesting to examine cause-
specific mortality, which we have not
done in this article. Integrating cause-
specific mortalities (T.B.V. and J.E.M.,
unpublished data, August 1999) gener-
ates a total that can serve as a validity
check on the current results; prelimi-
nary findings show consistency be-
tween those results and results herein.
Obesity is a major cause of mortality
in the United States. Aside from mor-
tality rate, however, obesity substan-
tially increases morbidity4 and impairs
qualityoflife.46 Inessence,thehealthim-
pact of obesity far exceeds what we have
presented herein. This, combined with
the relative consistency in the esti-
mates from the 6 cohort studies, makes
it clear that obesity is a major public
health problem in the United States.

Appendix
Derivation of Equation for 
The probability of surviving (1 mi-
nus the probabilityof death) is a mix-
tureoftheprobabilityofsurvivingfor
persons in the obese or overweight,
reference, and other categories. This
can be expressed as follows:
1-P(D) = P(O)[1-P(D|O)]
+ P(R)[1-P(D|R)]
+ P(Q)[1-P(D|Q)].
Assuming the population struc-
ture and characteristics are stable (ie,
that death rates and birth rates are
maintaining the population at equi-
librium), the hazard rate, averaged
across all members of the popula-
tion at any 1 point in time, must be
constant over time. A constant haz-
ard rate implies an exponential sur-
vival distribution. This means that
1-P(D|O) = P(S|O) = e-h;
1-P(D|R) = P(S|R) = e-, and
1-P(D|Q) = P(S|Q) = e-q.
where S denotes the event of sur-
vival and  denotes time. Because we
are considering 1 year, if we mea-
sure time in years, then the  drops
out, leaving
1-P(D|O) = P(S|O) = e-h;
1-P(D|R) = P(S|R) = e-, and
1-P(D|Q) = P(S|Q) = e-q.
Thus, 1-P(D) = P(O)e-h + P(R)e-
+ P(Q)e-q.

So it is that medicine is surely deeply involved in the
social organization of our life, and that, if there is mean-
ing in the phrase "doctor-patient relation," this implies
the recognition of the patient as a social being who lives
in a network of relations, and not in the chance isola-
tion of sickness.
