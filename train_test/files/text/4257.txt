ABSTRACT
LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are thought to play a sig-
nificant role in cellular homeostasis during development and
disease by interacting with CMPs (chromatin-modifying pro-
teins). We recently showed that following transient focal
ischemia, the expression of many lncRNAs was altered sig-
nificantly in rat brain. We currently analyzed whether focal
ischemia also alters the association of lncRNAs with the
CMPs Sin3A and coREST (corepressors of the RE-1 silencing
transcription factor). RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation) com-
bined with lncRNA microarray analysis showed that 177 of
the 2497 lncRNAs expressed in rat cerebral cortex showed
significantly increased binding to either Sin3A or coREST fol-
lowing ischemia compared with sham. Of these, 26 lncRNAs
enriched with Sin3A and 11 lncRNAs enriched with coREST
were also up-regulated in their expressions after ischemia.
A majority of the lncRNAs enriched with these CMPs were
intergenic in origin. Evaluation of the expression profiles
of corresponding protein-coding genes showed that their
expression levels correlate with those of the lncRNAs with
which they shared a common locus. This is the first study
to show that stroke-induced lncRNAs might associate with
CMPs to modulate the post-ischemic epigenetic landscape.

INTRODUCTION
LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are a unique class of RNAs
that are >200 bp long and show specific spatiotemporal ex-
pression profiles (Batista and Chang, 2013). Perturbations
in the cerebral lncRNAome were shown to exacerbate the
pathophysiology of a variety of CNS (central nervous system)
disorders, drug addiction and cancer (Michelhaugh et al.,
2011; Pastori and Wahlestedt, 2012; Qiu et al., 2013). How-
ever, very little is known about the significance of lncRNAs
after acute injuries to the CNS. We recently showed that
the expression of many lncRNAs altered rapidly in rat brain
following transient focal cerebral ischemia (Dharap et al.,
2012). Recent studies have shown evidence of physical as-
sociations between lncRNAs and CMPs (chromatin modify-
ing proteins) such as polycomb repressive complex 2, ly-
sine (K)-specific demethylase, euchromatic histone-lysine N-
methyltransferase 2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucle-
oprotein K (Nagano et al., 2008; Pandey et al., 2008; Khalil
et al., 2009; Huarte et al., 2010; Nagano and Fraser, 2011;
Rinn and Chang, 2012a). These interactions were shown to
be crucial for global processes such as chromosome inactiva-
tion and lineage-specific gene repression (Nagano and Fraser,
2009; Pandey and Kanduri, 2011), as well as local events such
as the p53 response to environmental insults (Huarte et al.,
2010). These studies suggest that lncRNAs play an essential
role in epigenetic silencing exerted by CMPs.

Recent studies showed that the neuronal REST (RE-1 si-
lencing transcription factor) and its corepressors Sin3A and
coREST were robustly activated in the rodent brain and to-
gether mediated the epigenetic silencing of several neuronal
genes resulting in neuronal death after cerebral ischemia
(Noh et al., 2012). REST is also known to control the expres-
sion of non-coding RNAs in brain pathologies such as Hunt-
ington's disease (Johnson et al., 2010). We currently evalu-
ated whether stroke-responsive lncRNAs interact with Sin3A
and coREST, the CMPs associated with REST (Andres et al.,
1999; Grimes et al., 2000; Ballas and Mandel, 2005).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Transient focal ischemia
A 1 h transient MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) was
induced in adult, male, spontaneously hypertensive rats (280足
320 g; Charles River) under isoflurane anesthesia by the in-
traluminal suture method as described earlier (Dharap et al.,
2012; Pandi et al., 2013). All surgical procedures were ap-
proved by the Research Animal Resources and Care Commit-
tee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and animals were
cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals, US Department of Health and Human
Services Publication number 86足23 (revised). After suturing
the wound, 0.5% bupivacaine (0.25 ml) was injected along
the incision to provide short duration local anesthesia. The
animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and re-
turned to the cage with ad libitum access to food and water.
During the surgery, rats were under spontaneous respira-
tion. Rats were killed at 6 h of reperfusion and the ipsilateral
cortex was dissected. Sham-operated rats served as control.
RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation)
Cortical tissue was homogenized in 1:1 phosphate-buffered
saline and nuclear isolation buffer [1.28 M sucrose; 40 mM
Tris足HCl pH 7.5; 20 mM MgCl2
; 4% (v/v) Triton X-100], cen-
trifuged at 2750 g for 15 min and the nuclear pellet was
resuspended in RIP buffer (Millipore). Resuspended nuclear
fraction was mechanically sheared using a homogenizer, cen-
trifuged at 13000 g for 10 min and the lysate was collected.
Antibodies against Sin3A [polyclonal ChIP (chromatin im-
munoprecipitation grade) ab3479; Abcam] and coREST (poly-
clonal ChIP grade; 07足455; Millipore) were incubated with
magnetic agarose A/G beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h and the
nuclear lysates were incubated with these antibody-beads
complex overnight with gentle rotation. The beads were then
collected using a magnetic stand, resuspended and washed
four times in RIP buffer. 20 l of this extract was used for
Western blotting to confirm Sin3A and coREST pull-down.
Briefly, 20 l of RIP lysate was electrophoresed on a de-
naturing PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane
and probed using Sin3A, coREST and -actin antibodies and
the corresponding HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-tagged sec-
ondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by
chemiluminescence detection and visualization of the bands.
lncRNA microarray
RNA was extracted from the RIP nuclear lysate preparation
using the Magna RIP kit (Millipore), linearly amplified, la-
beled with Cy3-dCTP, purified by RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qia-
gen), fragmented and hybridized to an Arraystar lncRNA
expression microarray containing 9300 lncRNA probes as
described previously (Dharap et al., 2012). Differentially ex-
pressed transcripts were identified by fold-change screening
with a threshold of 2-fold. Statistically significant differ-
ences between the groups were identified by the statistical
measures built in the GeneSpring based on the t test P value
method with a high stringency (fold change cutoff of >2 and
a probability value of <0.001 to decrease false-positives).
Real-time PCR
The mRNA expression of Dclk1 (doublecortin-like kinase
1), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Fmr1 (fragile
X mental retardation 1); Galntrl6 (UPD-N-acetyl-alpha-
D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltrans-
ferase-like 6); Fos (FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene) was eval-
uated with real-time PCR using the SYBR-Green method
as described earlier using 18s rRNA as an internal
control (Dharap et al., 2009). The following primer se-
quences (5 to 3 ) designed with Primer Express Soft-
ware (Applied Biosystems) based on the GenBank numbers
given in parenthesis were used for real-time PCR: Dclk1
(NM_053343): CGGCAAGTCACCAAGTCCAT and ACATCGCTC-
CACTGTGTCTTT; GFAP (NM_017009): GCCTCTCCCTGTCTC-

microarray analysis (RIP-chip). The RIP-chiP showed a
significant increase in enrichment of 99 lncRNAs with
Sin3A and 78 lncRNAs with coREST in the ischemia group
compared with the sham group. Three lncRNAs showed
increased binding to both Sin3A and coREST, as well
as increased expression after focal ischemia compared with
sham (Table 1). Twelve lncRNAs showed increased binding
to both Sin3A and coREST after focal ischemia, but were
not induced in their expression after stroke (Table 1). A
further 23 lncRNAs that showed increased binding to Sin3A
(Table 2) and eight lncRNAs that showed increased binding
to coREST (Table 3) were also significantly up-regulated
after focal ischemia compared with sham. A further 61
lncRNAs showed increased binding to Sin3A and 55 lncRNAs
showed increased binding to coREST after focal ischemia,
but none of them were induced in their expression after
stroke (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2; available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e124add.htm).
Importantly, of 537 lncRNAs significantly induced ( 2-
fold) at 6 h of reperfusion after transient MCAO, the top 17
stroke-induced lncRNAs (up-regulated from 22- to 93-fold
over sham) (Dharap et al., 2012) were not enriched with ei-
ther protein (Sin3A or coREST) evaluated by RIP. For the top
50 stroke-induced lncRNAs (up-regulated from 7- to 93-fold
over sham), only seven showed increased enrichment with
Sin3A and three showed increased enrichment with coREST.
Together, this demonstrates that the enrichment of lncRNAs
with Sin3A and coREST is not an artifact of an overall increase
in lncRNA gene expression after stroke, but instead selective
recruitment by these proteins. Interestingly, 74 and 85% of
the lncRNAs enriched with Sin3A and coREST, respectively,
were not significantly up-regulated following stroke suggest-
ing that they may be present as dormant reserve pools in the
healthy cortex that are subsequently targeted for recruit-
ment by activated Sin3A and coREST following an ischemic
insult.
Genomic correlates of the Sin3A and
coREST-associated lncRNAs
LncRNAs are transcribed from various loci including introns
of protein-coding genes (sense), antisense to protein-coding
genes and intergenic stretches (Rinn and Chang, 2012b). Ma-
jority of the lncRNAs that showed significantly increased
binding to Sin3A and coREST after stroke are intergenic
(65%) or intragenic (sense exon or intron; 28%), while 7%
are either bidirectional or antisense in origin (Figure 1).
Of the 15 lncRNAs co-enriched with both Sin3A and
coREST after stroke, 11 are intergenic and 4 are intragenic
(Table 1). Of the three lncRNAs that showed increased en-
richment with both Sin3A and coREST as well as induced in
expression after stroke, two are intergenic and one is
intragenic (Table 1). The Fos locus produced an lncRNA
that showed increased binding to both Sin3A and coREST
(Table 1). Some Sin3A-enriched lncRNAs transcribed from in-
tragenic loci that are particularly relevant to stroke, such as
the transcription factor Fos, Dclk1 and the astrocytic acti-
vation marker GFAP (Table 2). Interestingly, the Dclk1 locus
produced two lncRNAs, both of which were significantly in-
duced after stroke and showed increased binding to Sin3A
compared with sham (Table 2).

Expression of protein-coding genes associated
with the intragenic lncRNAs
The observation that several Sin3A and coREST associated
lncRNAs originated from intragenic loci suggested that their
expression might be associated with that of the correspond-
ing protein-coding transcripts. Hence, we analyzed the post-
ischemic expression of the protein-coding genes Dclk1, GFAP,
Fmr1, Galntrl1 and Fos associated with the intragenic lncR-
NAs that were up-regulated in their expression as well as
association to Sin3A and/or coREST. Of these, Fos was up-
regulated by 3.8-fold at 6 h reperfusion and 9.8-fold at
12 h reperfusion compared with sham (Figure 2). GFAP was

DISCUSSION
The mammalian genome transcribes numerous lncRNAs that
show evolutionary conservation and are expressed in a stage
and cell specific manner (Mercer and Mattick, 2013; Sabin
et al., 2013). Recent studies suggested that altered lev-
els and/or functionality of lncRNAs play a role in various
pathologies including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and my-
ocardial infarction (Pastori and Wahlestedt, 2012; Ounzain
et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2013).
A major function attributed to lncRNAs is to bind with
CMPs and modulate their transcriptional activity (Rinn and
Chang, 2012a). Hence, a change in the expression profiles
of lncRNAs under pathological conditions might significantly
influence the functionality of CMPs. We recently showed that
stroke alters the expression profiles of lncRNAs in a rapid and
significant manner in rodent brain (Dharap et al., 2012). To
understand the implications of the altered lncRNAome in
post-stroke pathophysiology, we currently evaluate whether
ischemia promotes the association of lncRNAs with the CMPs
that act as corepressors of the transcription factor REST. Re-
cent studies showed that REST up-regulation promotes post-
ischemic neuronal death (Noh et al., 2012; Pandi et al., 2013).
REST is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in
the phenotypic maturation of neurons by silencing neural
genes in the non-neural cells of CNS during development.
REST expression in the normal, adult brain is known to be low.
Sin3A and coREST are essential corepressors of REST that bind
to its opposite terminals and recruit other silencing factors
to the target loci (Ballas and Mandel, 2005). Our results show
that the physical association of many lncRNAs with Sin3A
and coREST increase significantly following stroke. Although
lncRNA expression and binding to CMPs are independent
events, several lncRNAs that showed increased binding to
Sin3A and coREST also showed increased expression follow-
ing focal ischemia. This suggests that the Sin3A- and coREST-
enriched lncRNAs induced after stroke might play important
roles in modifying the post-ischemic epigenetic landscape by
modulating the REST-mediated gene silencing.
Previous work exploring the binding of various CMPs to
lncRNAs showed that each protein has a distinct lncRNA
signature with marginal overlap with other related CMPs
(Khalil et al., 2009). Our data support this by showing that a
majority of the stroke-induced lncRNAs were bound to Sin3A
or coREST with only three common lncRNAs that bound to
both. Since Sin3A and coREST bind opposite termini of REST,
these overlapping lncRNAs might serve as a scaffold to recruit
Sin3A and coREST to the REST complex and/or facilitate the
recruitment of other proteins such as histone deacetylases
that are common to both corepressors (Ballas and Mandel,
2005; Roopra et al., 2012).
Most of the lncRNAs that showed increased binding to
Sin3A and coREST are intergenic. However, some are also
intragenic and were mapped to the loci of protein-coding
genes such as Fos, Dclk1, GFAP and Fmr1. The impact of the
intragenic lncRNAs on the expression of the corresponding
protein-coding transcripts is unclear. LncRNAs can silence
or activate the expression of the associated genes cis or in
trans (Batista and Chang, 2013). The expression of lncRNA
MRAK159688 that originates from an exon of Fos was ob-
served to be up-regulated by 13-fold after focal ischemia.
RIP data showed that the enrichment of MRAK159688 with
both Sin3A and coREST also increased after focal ischemia
by 3-fold. We observed that Fos expression was also in-
duced significantly after ischemia. Although MRAK159688
is not transcribed by Fos per se, their co-expression from

the same locus may position the lncRNA to serve as an
upstream regulator or downstream effector of Fos proba-
bly via REST and its corepressors. A similar functional as-
sociation was previously shown for lincRNA-p21 and p53.
The lincRNA-p21 induced by p53 was shown to associate
with a p53 complex to repress the expression of p53 tar-
get genes (Huarte et al., 2010). AF030089 and MRAK135044
are stroke-induced lncRNAs that originate from a sense exon
and sense intron, respectively, of the Dclk1 gene. Both lncR-
NAs showed identical expression levels (distinct probes incor-
porating the sequence variation were used to detect these
two lncRNAs) and were significantly enriched with Sin3A.
This suggests that these two lncRNAs might control Dclk1
function via Sin3A in the post-ischemic cortex. The lncRNA
EF094477 is also intragenic from GFAP gene locus. We ob-
served that the expression and binding to Sin3A of EF094477
were induced after ischemia by 6.8- and 2.4-fold, respec-
tively, and GFAP expression was also induced concomitantly.
Not all lncRNA/protein-coding pairs from the same loci will
be co-regulated. For example, expression of Dclk1 and Gal-
ntrl1 was not altered although the lncRNAs associated with
their gene loci (AF030089, MRAK1335044 and XR007355)
were up-regulated in their expression as well as binding to
Sin3A/coREST. However, our data indicate that the stroke-
induced lncRNAs expressed from intragenic loci does not ex-
hibit a cis inhibitory effect. Instead, these lncRNAs might
either induce or serve to maintain the expression of the
protein-coding transcripts at a normal level by activating
the epigenetic signatures as demonstrated previously (Huang
et al., 2010). Furthermore, some lncRNAs showed coexpres-
sion with their corresponding protein-coding genes while
others did not. Hence, it is possible that intragenic lncRNAs
may be transcribed differentially from the same transcrip-
tion start sites as that of the corresponding protein-coding
genes or via novel internal start sites independent of the
protein-coding gene unit.
In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate sig-
nificantly increased association between ischemia- induced
lncRNAs with CMPs Sin3A and coREST. While we studied
only two CMPs, there might be others that are active in the
post-ischemic brain and may bind to ischemia-induced lncR-
NAs to form unique ribonucleoprotein functional complexes.
Such interactions might be functionally significant for the
ischemic pathophysiology.
