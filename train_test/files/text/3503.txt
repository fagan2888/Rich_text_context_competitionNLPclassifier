Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in 2010
that there were 42 million overweight and obese children
under the age of 5 years, and it is estimated that 9.5 per cent
of infants worldwide are above the 95th percentile in weight
(Ogden et al., 2010). One of the risk factors for obesity in
early life is rapid weight gain in infancy (Baird et al., 2005),
but risk is also conferred by the following factors: the
mother's body mass index (BMI) as well as her weight
gain during pregnancy (Cedergren, 2004), duration of
breastfeeding and bottle feeding (Dietz and Gortmaker,
2001), the age at which solid foods are introduced (Ong
et al., 2006) and parental feeding practices (Brown and
Arnott, 2014).
Decisions about feeding early in life, such as whether to
breastfeed and for how long, are important determinants of
growthvelocity(SinghalandLanigan,2007).Breastfeeding
is likely to contribute to responsive feeding since it is
thought that mothers are more in tune with their baby's
hunger and satiety cues. Mode of feeding, when solid
foods are introduced, what is fed during weaning, parental
feeding styles and behaviours during mealtimes shape
early eating habits (Blissett, 2011). Birch (2006) notes that
a parent's role is not to decide how much the child should
eat but to determine the type of food that children are intro-
duced to, the portion size, the frequency with which it is
eaten and the social context within which eating occurs.
This has been used as a core construct within the NOURISH
trial: `mother provides, child decides' (Daniels et al.,
2009). Moreover, feeding behaviours vary, and Blissett
(2011) notes that each mother tends to follow a different
feeding style. For example, an authoritarian feeding style
(a controlling type of feeding) is characterized by strict
rules about food consumption, whereas an authoritative
(more responsive in terms of warmth) feeding style
involves placing high expectations upon the child's diet
(i.e. healthy foods).

Abstract
We examined mealtime interactions to assess whether they varied according to maternal body mass index, country and
mode of feeding in 41 Israeli and UK mother­infant dyads. Feeding behaviours were coded using the Simple Feeding
Element Scale. Significantly, more UK mothers breastfed during the filmed meal compared to Israeli mothers. Mealtime
interactions did not vary according to maternal body mass index or country. Women who breastfed (as opposed to
those who bottle fed or fed solids) provided fewer distractions during the meal, a more ideal feeding environment and
fed more responsively.

Intervention Study
2 Health Psychology Open 
Few studies have explored maternal characteristics and
infant feeding behaviours. However, Brown and Lee (2011)
investigated maternal feeding style during weaning and
noted that mothers with a high BMI show a high level of
concern for their child's weight and attempt to control their
child's size. The findings by Brown and Lee (2011) there-
fore suggest that mothers who scored high in the restraint
and emotional eating sub-scales of the Dutch Eating
Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) were more concerned
for their child's weight compared to mothers who scored
lower. Interestingly enough, those mothers who saw them-
selves as heavy also perceived their infant's body size as
larger than average. In support, Rodgers et al. (2013) noted
that maternal dietary restraint predicted infant's change in
BMI Z-scores.
These findings strengthen the claim that feeding is not
only about what the infant eats but also about how a mother
and her infant interact during the meal. Understanding the
complexity of early mealtime interactions and their effect
in the long term is of considerable interest since early expe-
riences of feeding predict eating later in life (Nicklaus and
Remy, 2013).
Studies have shown that infants are born with the ability
to self-regulate their consumption of food and signal to
their mothers when they are hungry and when they are full.
Birch notes that parents may not recognize their infant's
hunger and satiety signals; consequently, they over-feed
their infant, potentially leading to a reduced ability to self-
regulate (Birch et al., 2003; Birch and Fisher, 1998; Stifter
et al., 2011). Li et al. (2010) suggested that infants who
were bottle-fed in early infancy were more likely to empty
the bottle or cup in late infancy compared to infants who
were fed directly from the breast. Breastfeeding is therefore
associated with the infant actively drawing the milk out of
the breast, thus controlling the pace of their meal and
energy consumption.
Formula feeding or feeding breast milk from a bottle
may encourage a more passive form of feeding since moth-
ers can judge volume consumed and may be more able to
control the feed duration and amount. Therefore, feeding
from a bottle is associated with parental feeding control and
lower ability to self-regulate energy intake (Arenz et al.,
2004). Thus, some feeding practices in early infancy are
positively associated with poorer energy compensation,
overconsumption and eventually the development of later
obesity (Baker et al., 2004). A recent follow-up study by Li
et al. (2014) noted some long-term effects of early feeding
styles on eating behaviours at 6 years of age. Bottle-fed
infants were more likely to be encouraged to empty their
bottles and showed lower satiety responsiveness at 6 years
old compared to breastfed infants. Thus, feeding practices
can have an enduring impact on later eating traits.
In addition, excessive parental control over feeding such
as restriction or pressure to eat may be adversely associated
with under- or overfeeding, respectively, potentially lead-
ing to feeding problems (Farrow and Blissett, 2006b;
Johnson and Birch, 1994). Other studies suggest that lower
levels of feeding behaviour control promote healthier
eating behaviours in childhood (Faith et al., 2004; Fisher
and Birch, 1999; Savage et al., 2007).
Several studies have now shown the high levels of herit-
ability in eating traits such as food fussiness or satiety
responsiveness (Llewellyn et al., 2010). This further sug-
gests that parental feeding practices such as restriction or
pressure may be in response to inherent child eating traits.
Some eating traits could place children at a higher risk of
obesity, for example, rapid eating, eating in the absence of
hunger, eating enjoyment and low satiety responsiveness.
Fisher and Birch (2002) demonstrated that obese children
are more likely to eat in the absence of hunger and respond
less to internal cues of satiety than healthy weight
children.
Given the influence of eating traits on the risk of obesity
and the role of parents in responding to these characteris-
tics, mealtimes may hold the key to understanding the
dynamic nature of the parent­child interaction in determin-
ing food intake and the development of appetite control.
Eating traits can be measured with questionnaires such as
the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (Llewellyn et al.,
2011) or the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (Wardle
and Johnson, 2002). However, mealtime interactions are
best understood in real time and via recorded observations
rather than recall. This presents a methodological challenge
insofar as it requires both the presence of an investigator
during mealtimes and a valid coding structure to score dis-
crete behaviours of the mother and the baby during the
meal.
Even with validated coding schemes, such as the Nursing
Child Assessment Feeding Scale (NCFAS; Hodges et al.,
2007), there remain challenges including low reliability
and low internal consistency of the scale for infants under
12 months of age. In addition, coding behaviours is made
more difficult since mothers report difficulty in understand-
ing cues from their babies signalling hunger and satiety
during meals (Hodges et al., 2008). Notwithstanding the
difficulty of observing and characterizing mealtime interac-
tions, the early feeding period provides an important win-
dow into how caregivers affect infant self-regulation of
energy intake and also how responsive parents are to their
infant's temperament and eating traits. In particular, it is
useful to capture the mood, atmosphere and characteristics
of the verbal communication during feeds since the meal-
time is not merely about the content of the meal but how it
is delivered and what is said.
This study is nested within a larger study exploring feel-
ings, eating behaviours and infant feeding practices in
Israeli and UK mothers from pregnancy (Shloim et al.,
2013) until 2 years post-partum (Shloim et al., 2014).
Shloim et al. 3
The rationale for comparing the two countries is primarily
based on cultural differences, for example, the greater iden-
tification by Israeli women with American ideals of body
image. Laungani (2006) notes that body dissatisfaction is
more common in countries where people have a more
Western lifestyle with Israeli women being exposed to
aspects of Western values through media and by its close
relationships with the United States (Heesacker et al.,
2000). Despite Western influences, Israel is considered
non-Western in terms of lifestyle (Heesacker et al., 2000),
as being less affluent and privileged than the United States.
Thus, Israeli women show lower levels of body dissatisfac-
tion compared to American women (Barak et al., 1994;
Heesacker et al., 2000; Safir et al., 2005) despite the accept-
ance of the thin ideal in both countries.
Both Israel and the United Kingdom are Western-
focused, industrially developed countries. However, life
in Israel is very different to that in the United Kingdom.
Israel is a relatively new country (established in 1948)
constantly battling for recognition within a hostile cli-
mate. The average number of children in Israel is three per
family (Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), 2007;
Remennick, 2000) compared to 1.7 in the United Kingdom
(Shaw and Giles, 2009). The majority of Israelis perceive
childless people to have empty lives (Remennick, 2000),
whereas studies from the United Kingdom report the
increasing numbers of voluntarily childless women (Shaw,
2010). It is therefore possible that higher levels of stress
in Israel, shorter duration of maternal leave and the threat
of losing your child to military service all contribute to
very different experiences of motherhood, to well-being
and to the eating behaviours of Israeli and UK women.
Previous comparisons of Israeli and UK mothers found
no differences in infant eating behaviours, but across both
countries, heavier mothers tended to feed their infants
according to a schedule (Shloim et al., 2014). In support,
the EMPOWER study reported that obese mothers were
observed as responding during feeding with pressure to eat
or a restriction on eating depending on the size of their
9-month-old infants (Barlow et al., 2010).
Taking account of the importance of maternal BMI and
the possible influence of cultural differences as reported by
Shloim et al. (2013), the primary aim of this study was to
investigate mealtime interactions of mother­baby dyads,
within a sample of healthy weight and overweight/obese
mothers. It was hypothesized that (a) heavier mothers
would have less positive feeding interactions than healthy
weight mothers, (b) the babies of heavier mothers would
have a faster pace of eating and a greater interest in food
and (c) breastfeeding mothers would be more in tune with
their baby's signals during feeding and be less distracted by
external cues. Moreover, as the length of maternity leave
varies between Israel and the United Kingdom (Shloim et al.,
2014) resulting in Israeli mothers returning to work 14
weeks following birth (compared to UK mothers who
return to work 26­52 weeks post-partum), it was hypothe-
sized that Israeli mothers would have fewer feeding experi-
ences than UK mothers, potentially resulting in a less
positive mealtime interaction.
Methods
Participants
The sample was drawn from 156 women in Israel (N=67)
and the United Kingdom (N=89) who were participating in
a study to explore emotions and eating behaviours during
pregnancy (Shloim et al., 2013). A total of 73 women par-
ticipated in the follow-up study (N=42; 59% (Israel),
N
=
31; 41% (the United Kingdom)). These women were
approached to take part in an in-depth study on feeding
interactions involving filmed feeding in the home every 6
months for 2 years. A total of 41 mothers were filmed four
times resulting in a total of 164 films exploring mealtime
interactions (in a 2-year follow-up). The results of the first
recorded mealtime are presented here. Although the sample
sizeisrelativelysmall(furtheraddressedinthe`Limitations'
section), given the eventual recruited numbers and the
acknowledged cultural differences between the two coun-
tries, certain comparisons were made between Israeli ver-
sus UK samples. Furthermore, large sample sizes are
difficult to obtain in studies of filmed mother­infant inter-
actions as described by Khadr et al. (2011).
Procedure
The researcher (N.S.) contacted all mothers between 5 and
12 weeks after the birth of their child and set a date to visit,
at a convenient time to film a `meal'. The researcher asked
the participants to feed their baby as normal and try to
ignore the presence of the researcher. The time of the meet-
ing was arranged in advance to coincide with the usual time
of a feed, although this was more challenging with breast-
fed infants. Mothers were interviewed on this occasion
with questions on mood, eating behaviours following preg-
nancy, their infant's daily schedule and eating habits as
described elsewhere (Shloim et al., in press). Thus, on the
few occasions mothers suspected the baby was not yet
ready to eat, the researcher waited until the mother felt
it was the right time to feed and then subsequently
interviewed the mother. Thus, in most of the occasions, the
feeding commenced after babies demonstrated hunger by
crying or by being unsettled.
Breastfeeding was defined as a feed directly from
the breast, not expressed milk given by bottle. Non-
breastfeeding meals were defined as those where formula
or solid foods such as pureed fruits, vegetables or bread
with soft cheese were offered to the infant.

The Simple Feeding Elements Scale
The Simple Feeding Elements Scale (SFES; Mohebati, in
preparation) was developed from the Health Exercise and
Nutrition for the Really Young (HENRY) programme, an
intervention aimed at preventing obesity within the first few
months of an infant's life (Brown et al., 2013; Rudolf et al.,
2010). The scale was also used as part of the EMPOWER
clinical trial (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
20645998) which was developed to empower mothers to
prevent the development of obesity from infancy, results of
which were submitted to the UK Department of Health in
March 2007 (Reference Number 060/0003). The scale origi-
nally contained 7 feeding variables but was modified to
include 10 variables pertaining to mother­baby feeding
interactions (see Box 1). Examples of the elements are the
positioning item for which a higher score is awarded for
feeding the baby face-to-face, whereas a lower score is
awarded when the baby is facing the TV. Another element is
child participation where the baby is encouraged to self-
feed, and as such, a lower score is awarded when mothers
restrict eating, such as when a mother removes a plate from
her child in order to prevent him or her from eating indepen-
dently. The SFES is rated on a 3-point Likert scale by a
trained observer, ranging from 1 (less ideal; indicating feed-
ing while the baby is distracted by TV or toys, feeding foods
which are less healthy) to 3 (more ideal; feeding the baby
face to face, pausing the feed while a potent disengagement
cue occurs, etc.). Elements were coded separately as
Cronbach's alpha showed a weak correlation between the
scale elements. Further details of the scale are available
elsewhere (Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training;
Barnard et al., 1993; Mohebati, in preparation). All films
were viewed by the lead researcher (N.S.), a qualified psy-
chotherapist with training in both the SFES and Nursing
Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST). A second
researcher (C.N.), trained in the SFES, was asked to view
the films and code them independently. Finally, the third
researcher (L.M.; experienced NCAST and SFES coder)
also viewed and rated the material independently. For vari-
ables that did not reach an agreement of more than 75 per
cent, L.M. adjudicated the final score.
Box 1. The Simple Feeding Elements Scale (SFES): description of elements.
Element Description of element
Setting Absence of distractions during the meal such as no TV, no toys and so on. A
less ideal feeding occurs while the infant is watching the TV while eating.
Positioning Infant and caregiver face each other during the meal. A less ideal positing is
while an eye-contact is impossible.
Mood and atmosphere Caregiver enjoys the mealtime interaction compared to caregivers feeling
annoyed or irritated during the feed.
Child participation Infant is encouraged to participate in self-feeding. A less positive feed is
while the caregiver restrains infants' attempts to self-feed, by removing the
plate, for example.
Pacing Caregiver allows the infant to set the pace of eating.
Avoids feeding while distracted Caregiver avoids feeding the infant when distracted.
Avoids feeding while disengaging Caregiver avoids feeding when the infant needs a break (i.e. is disengaging).
Qualitative aspects of verbal communication Caregiver avoids using commands or negative comments during the
mealtime such as `eat this', `no more of this' and so on.
Quantitative aspects of verbal communications Caregiver talks to the infant during the mealtime. A less ideal feed is while
no vocalization is observed.
Fruits, vegetables and breast milk The meal contains fruits, vegetables and/or breast milk.
BMI and weight measurements
Babies' weight, length/height and age at measurement
were recorded from the Child Health Parent Held Records
(`red book' in the United Kingdom and equivalent in
Israel). Standardized Z-scores for weight (WHO, 2010)
were calculated for all infants and are presented as mean
Z-scores for weight in Table 1. One infant was born
pre-term and the Z-score for weight was excluded from the
table. The results from this meal interaction were origi-
nally removed as eating behaviours vary between pre-term
and full-term babies. However, as no significant differ-
ences were observed when removed or retained, the data
were kept. Mothers were asked to report their own weight
and height and then BMI was calculated as weight (kg)
divided by height (m) squared. Mothers were then
categorized as underweight (BMI<18.5kg/m2), healthy
weight (25kg/m2>BMI18.5kg/m2), overweight
(30kg/m2>BMI25kg/m2) or obese (BMI
30kg/m2)
using WHO classifications. The validation process for
maternal self-reported BMI was conducted using a sensi-
tivity analysis. This was carried out by creating a second
Shloim et al. 5
variable where 2kg was added and subtracted to weights,
and the BMI categories were re-checked. This analysis
resulted in no difference in the distribution across the cat-
egories, providing confidence that the use of reported
rather than measured BMI was acceptable. Due to the rela-
tively low number of underweight and obese women
(N=4vs N
=
6, respectively), the categories were pooled
and the analysis undertaken comparing healthy weight
(N=28; BMI<25kg/m2) to overweight/obese women
(N=13; BMI25kg/m2). The limitations of this proce-
dure are further addressed at the end of this article.
Data analysis
Analysis was conducted using Stata version 12 and SPSS
Statistics 20. Each film was scored according to the SFES.
Mann­Whitney tests were applied to determine any potential
differences between mothers according to sociodemographic
variables such as age and levels of education. An additional
variable to identify mode of feeding (breastfeeding vs other
feeding) was created and its correlation with BMI and SFES
scores assessed. All scores were then compared by BMI cat-
egory and by mode of feeding (i.e. frequency of mothers
obtaining ideal, average or less than ideal ratings for each
element) using the Mann­Whitney test. Spearman's rank
correlation test was applied to determine whether there was
any evidence of correlation between each element of the
SFES. Finally, the data were analysed to determine whether
there were differences in the results between the two coun-
tries, using the Mann­Whitney test.

Results
A total of 41 women from Israel and the United Kingdom
agreed to take part in the study. Table 1 presents the main
characteristics of the participants who were filmed.
Mothers' mean age was 34.1 (3.8) years. Most were mar-
ried (N=38, 87%), multiparous and 14 women were primi-
parous. Maternal BMI was similar in both countries, and
most mothers were within the healthy weight range com-
pared to overweight/obese. At the time of filming, babies
ranged in age from 5 to 24 weeks. This reflected mothers'
availability and willingness to arrange a filmed mealtime.
Mothers reported that they introduced solid foods between
4 and 6 months. The findings were not in agreement with
the national recommendations in Israel and the United
Kingdom advising mothers to introduce solid food at 6
months. (http://www.health.gov.il/English/SearchResults/
Pages/GlobalSearch.aspx; http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/
pregnancy-and-baby/pages/solid-foods-weaning.aspx).
Babies' age was normally distributed with two outliers:
one baby being much younger (5 weeks of age) and one
baby older (27 weeks) than the main cohort. The average
age of introduction to solid food was 16 weeks and did not
vary significantly between countries. No significant differ-
ences were identified between countries for the age at
which weaning commenced. Mode of feeding was similar
in both countries, and significantly more women had ever
breastfed compared to those who had not in each country
(p
<
0.01). Of the total sample, 83 per cent of women had
initiated breastfeeding and were either still breastfeeding or
had stopped at the time of the study. Nevertheless, only 48
per cent of the women breastfed during the filmed interac-
tions. Significantly, more women from the United Kingdom
elected to breastfeed their baby during the mealtime com-
pared to the Israeli sample (p<0.01). This might be attrib-
uted to the working status of mothers with higher levels of
stay-at home mothers in the United Kingdom compared to
Israel. Thus, breastfeeding during the day (in which the
films were recorded) was more common in the United
Kingdom simply due to work constraints. The higher levels
in UK breastfeeding mothers were not significantly related
to babies' age.
SFES
Most mothers scored the maximum for most of the ele-
ments of the scale (3). As such, mothers tend to feed a
healthy meal, not in front of the TV and did not use feeding
commands. In other words, this sample consisted of moth-
ers who were generally responsive to their infants. Their
behaviours were commensurate with a healthy level of
interaction, whether they elected to breastfeed, bottle-feed
or provide their infants with solids during the mealtime.
Table 2 presents the scores for the SFES, first for the total
sample and then according to BMI category and mode of
feeding. Mean duration of the feed was 21 (4.8) minutes
(range: 8­26 minutes) and was similar between breastfeed-
ing and other feeding modes ((21.8 (4.9) versus 19.5 (4.5)
minutes, respectively).
Relation to maternal BMI
Among the healthy weight mothers, just over half elected to
breastfeed on the day of filming compared to feeding a
mixed or solid food meal. Among the overweight mothers,
fewer elected to breastfeed on the day of filming compared
to offering a bottle or solid meal, but this was not signifi-
cantly different either within the group or compared to
healthy weight mothers. BMI category revealed no signifi-
cant differences in mealtime interaction scores in the SFES
(Table 2, Figure 1).
Mode of feeding
Significant differences in SFES elements were found by
mode of feeding (Figure 2, Table 3). For example, breast-
feeding mothers were more likely to feed without distrac-
tion (the baby accepts the feed without being distracted;
p
<
0.01) and scored higher for setting (no distractions of
TV or toys during mealtime; p<0.05). They were also more
likely to pause the feed during a potent disengagement cue
(p
<
0.01), such as turning the head away or face gazing.
Breastfeeding mothers by definition allowed the baby to
self-feed and determine their own pace of eating.
Correlations between and within SFES elements
The duration of feeding correlated with feeding disengage-
ment (=0.16; p
<
0.05). Thus, the longer the feed, the
more likely mothers would pause in order to respond to dis-
engagement cues such as arching the back or moving the
head away from the food or the breast.
Child participation was negatively correlated with posi-
tioning (=-0.42; p
<
0.01) indicating that a face-to-face
position during the meal was associated with greater restric-
tion of the child self-feeding (Table 3). Child participation
was also positively correlated with pacing (=0.62;
p
<
0.01), suggesting that children who fed themselves
determined their own pace of eating. It was positively cor-
related with feeding commands (=0.65; p<0.01; qualita-
tive aspects of verbal communication). Thus, the more
mothers encouraged self-feeding, the fewer eating com-
mands they issued, such as `eat this now', `eat more',
`enough with the pasta'and so on, whether breastfed or oth-
erwise fed. Mothers who did not use feeding commands
were also likely to pause feeding during a disengagement
cue (=0.51; p<0.01).
Pacing was negatively correlated with positioning
(=-0.48; p
<
0.01). An ideal interaction would involve
caregiver and infant having their faces aligned, as in a

This is further addressed in the sections `Discussion' and
`Limitations'.
Analysis by country
Differences in feeding interactions by country were not sig-
nificant (Figure 3). However, trends revealed more positive
mealtime interactions within the UK sample. This could be
explained by the observation that UK babies' mean age and
weight at filming were greater than for the Israeli women
(Table 2), and significantly more UK women breastfed
their infants during the filmed feeding.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to investigate mealtime interactions
in mother­infant dyads when the infants were aged between
2 and 6 months. No differences were seen between meal-
time interactions for healthy weight women and overweight
or obese women or by country. However, breastfeeding was
associated with a more positive mealtime experience than
other modes of feeding. Breastfeeding mothers were more
in tune with their baby's signals during feeding and were
less distracted by external cues. Thus, in this study, breast-
feeding mothers provided a more positive interaction dur-
ing feeding by distracting the baby less, providing a more
ideal environment, pausing the feed to respond to infants'
signals to stop and facilitating independence through self-
feeding. In addition, the longer the duration of the meal, the
more mothers responded to their infant's disengagement by
pausing during the expression of a satiety cue (e.g. arching
the back or moving away from the breast). This was sup-
ported by a slightly longer duration of feeding for mothers
who initiated breastfeeding.
Fewer commands were issued by mothers when self-
feeding was encouraged. The more mothers enjoyed the
mealtime interaction (positive mood and atmosphere), the
more they encouraged self-feeding (allowing the baby to
hold and touch the breast while breastfeeding, holding the
bottle or finger food for solid food). Enjoyment did not dif-
fer by mode of feeding. These findings are similar to Farrow
and Blissett (2006) who demonstrated that breastfeeding
predicts fewer negative mealtime interactions in 1-year-old
infants, mainly as mothers are less likely to pressure their
infants to eat. In support, Brown and Arnott (2014) noted
that mothers who follow an infant-led feeding approach
(positively associated with breastfeeding) were more aware
of their infant's hunger and satiety cues. Thus, breastfeed-
ing can facilitate sensitivity to the infant's appetite (Caton
et al., 2012; Ong et al., 2006).
Breastfeeding mothers showed more positive outcomes
in relation to pacing, responding to disengagement cues
10 Health Psychology Open 
and providing fewer distractions, which can be transferred
to the complementary feeding period. Transitioning to sol-
ids is an important time when less maternal control and
more encouragement of infant self-feeding and setting their
own pace of eating (i.e. trusting the infant to know what is
best) may be important in establishing healthier future eat-
ing habits. The usefulness of SFES may reside in its ability
to identify elements of feeding interactions in the first year
of life which may potentially impact later eating behav-
iours. This is unique in comparison with other existing
feeding observation scales such as that developed by
Hodges et al. (2013), which are applied to feeding infants
aged 12 months and older.
Breastfeeding establishes a strong bond between mother
and infant (Kuzela et al., 1990), and many enjoy the inti-
macy being established in the feeding interaction with
higher levels of sensitivity to their infants 3 months post-
partum (Britton et al., 2007). However, in this study, there
was no difference in the level of enjoyment between moth-
ers who breastfed or those who fed solids/formula during
the meal. This could be attributable to the young age of the
babies and the possibility that in the early stages of feeding
the baby is less likely to exhibit food refusal and challenging
behaviours, so creating a more joyful and positive experi-
ence for the mother and her baby. This might also be attrib-
uted to the selectiveness of the sample (i.e. mothers were
interested in participating in a study about feeding their
babies) and were thus more attuned to feeding whether they
elected to breastfeed during the filmed interaction or not.
Breastfeeding produced a greater opportunity for posi-
tive mealtime interactions, even accounting for elements
of the scale which favour breastfeeding such as child par-
ticipation. This provides further confirmation of the bene-
fits of breastfeeding beyond nutrition (Shah, 2013), and
the psychological benefit to mother and baby. However,
for the positioning element of the scale, breastfeeding
mothers tended to exhibit only average or not ideal com-
pared to other elements. Thus, one might not expect a
breastfeeding mother to align her face with her child's dur-
ing breastfeeding as this is challenging given that the
child's mouth is facing the breast. However, a mother who
fails to align her face with her child during feeding due to
distractions (e.g. mobile phone, watching TV or looking
elsewhere) is less interactive and therefore coded as
having a less positive mealtime experience than mothers
who face their baby.
No significant differences between countries emerged,
and any findings were likely to be attributable to the differ-
ent modes of feeding chosen for the filmed interactions.
This may have been affected by the difference in paid
maternity leave entitlement between Israel and the United
Kingdom (see Shloim et al., 2014).
Women in our study were highly educated and of a rela-
tively high socioeconomic status, therefore more likely to
initiate and maintain breastfeeding within a generally
healthy lifestyle. This supports the findings of others
including Crombie et al. (2009) who described how par-
ents' age, level of education and health knowledge all play
an important role in food and feeding choices including
rates of breastfeeding. Moreover, breastfeeding could serve
as a learning experience for future feeding interactions, as
suggested by Britton et al. (2007). Breastfeeding mothers
who demonstrated more enjoyment in the feeding interac-
tions might be more inclined to translate this into later feed-
ing by being more in tune with their infant's feeding cues
and introduce healthier foods. We intend to follow up these
infants and mothers for 2 more years to explore any ongo-
ing effect of breastfeeding on larger mealtime interactions.

Limitations
Our findings should be considered in relation to the limitations
of the study. Women were self-selected and well-educated,
originating from a relatively affluent sub-population. This
might have impacted their decision and ability to breastfeed
and might have contributed to a more positive feeding
interaction. Although the power calculations showed that
the sample size was sufficient to determine significant dif-
ferences between Israeli and UK babies' and mothers' BMI
(for the combined sample of all four follow-ups), a larger
sample size with a broader range of weight categories might
have permitted observing clearer differences in feeding
interactions between countries and differing BMI catego-
ries. Moreover, it is possible that overweight and obese
women demonstrate different mealtime interactions which
were not considered here. This study combined both BMI
categories into a single BMI group. Thus, future research
could benefit by addressing possible differences for each
category independently. This sample had a smaller propor-
tion of overweight and obese women compared to levels
for the general population (WHO, 2010), perhaps due
to the skewed socioeconomic distribution or that obese
mothers may be less likely to agree to be filmed during
mealtime interactions. Finally, this study involved feeding
interactions on one occasion and there-fore may be unrep-
resentative of mother­infant feeding interactions more
generally. This will be addressed in the future with further
follow-up periods for each dyad, over 2 years.
Conclusion and recommendations
Our findings indicate the feasibility of assessing mother­
infant mealtime interactions in young infants and
contribute to previous research by providing evidence of
differences between breastfeeding and other feeding during
mealtime interactions. The study also emphasizes the
importance of exploring such interactions not only via what
is given within a meal but also by understanding mother­
infant levels of enjoyment and emotional interactions
during a meal. Mealtime interactions offer an insight into
the quality of the early feeding experience, and few studies
to date have achieved this within a natural setting. There is
a clear need to explore this area further within larger and
more diverse populations.
