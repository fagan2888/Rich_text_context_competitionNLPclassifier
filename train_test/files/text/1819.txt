Abstract
Background: Dietary supplement use in the United States is prevalent and represents an important source of nutrition.
However, little is known about individuals who routinely consume multiple dietary supplements. This study describes the
dietary supplement usage patterns, health, and nutritional status of long-term multiple dietary supplement users, and
where possible makes comparisons to non-users and multivitamin/mineral supplement users.
Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, information was obtained by online questionnaires and physical
examination (fasting blood, blood pressure, body weight) from a convenience sample of long-term users of multiple
dietary supplements manufactured by Shaklee Corporation (Multiple Supp users, n = 278). Data for non-users (No Supp
users, n = 602) and multivitamin/mineral supplement users (Single Supp users, n = 176) were obtained from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2002 and NHANES III 1988­1994. Logistic regression
methods were used to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
Results: Dietary supplements consumed on a daily basis by more than 50% of Multiple Supp users included a
multivitamin/mineral, B-complex, vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin E, calcium with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids,
flavonoids, lecithin, alfalfa, coenzyme Q10 with resveratrol, glucosamine, and a herbal immune supplement. The majority
of women also consumed gamma linolenic acid and a probiotic supplement, whereas men also consumed zinc, garlic, saw
palmetto, and a soy protein supplement. Serum nutrient concentrations generally increased with increasing dietary
supplement use. After adjustment for age, gender, income, education and body mass index, greater degree of supplement
use was associated with more favorable concentrations of serum homocysteine, C-reactive protein, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as lower risk of prevalent elevated blood pressure and diabetes.
Conclusion: This group of long-term multiple dietary supplement users consumed a broad array of vitamin/mineral,
herbal, and condition-specific dietary supplements on a daily basis. They were more likely to have optimal concentrations
of chronic disease-related biomarkers, and less likely to have suboptimal blood nutrient concentrations, elevated blood
pressure, and diabetes compared to non-users and multivitamin/mineral users. These findings should be confirmed by
studying the dietary supplement usage patterns, health, and nutritional status of other groups of heavy users of dietary
supplements.

Background
Diet and nutrition play important roles in the mainte-
nance of health and prevention of disease [1,2]. Dietary
supplements represent an important source of essential
nutrients since they are widely used and often contain
100% or more of the Daily Value of one or more nutrients
[3,4]. They are also of concern because of potential
adverse effects [5]. Prior studies have reported the preva-
lence of dietary supplement usage and the characteristics
of users in the United States (US) population. In the most
recent reporting of nationwide survey data, the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
1999­2000, 52% of adults reported taking a dietary sup-
plement in the past 30 days [4]. This and other surveys
have generally found that dietary supplement usage is
more common in women than men, in older participants
than in younger ones, in Whites compared with Blacks
and Mexican Americans, in the more educated as com-
pared to the less educated, and in the more affluent as
compared to less affluent [4]. In NHANES 1999­2000,
approximately 47% of dietary supplement users reported
taking only one type of supplement (most commonly a
multivitamin/mineral) [4]. Only 3 individuals out of over
11,000 surveyed reported taking 20 or more different sup-
plements in the past 30 days. Consequently, little if any
descriptive information has been reported about individ-
uals who typically consume multiple dietary supple-
ments.
This cross-sectional study was undertaken to describe the
dietary supplement usage patterns, serum nutrient and
biomarker concentrations, and health status of a conven-
ience sample of individuals who were daily users of mul-
tiple dietary supplements (median of 26 different dietary
supplements taken daily in the prior 12 months). In addi-
tion, biomarker concentrations and the health status of
multiple dietary supplement users were compared with
two other convenience samples assembled from
NHANES: non-users of supplements and those who con-
sumed a multivitamin/mineral supplement only.
Methods
Participants
To assemble a sample of long-term users of multiple die-
tary supplements, individuals who had been consumers
of dietary supplements for  20 years from a dietary sup-
plement manufacturer and distributor (Shaklee Corpora-
tion, Pleasanton, CA) were invited to participate in the
study. The invitation was sent by electronic mail to
approximately 1,200 individuals meeting this criterion.
Of the total invitees, 435 successfully completed online
questionnaires to obtain information about height,
annual household income, education, medical history
and current medical conditions, and dietary supplement
usage. Reasons for non-participation were not investi-
gated. A subset of 300 individuals who completed the
questionnaires and were free of cancer, other than non-
melanoma skin cancer, were randomly chosen and asked
to attend a physical examination for the purpose of pro-
viding a 12-hour fasting blood sample and having their
body weight and blood pressure measured. A final ana-
lytic sample of 278 participants had complete question-
naire and examination data. These individuals composed
the 'Multiple Supp' users. The study was reviewed and
approved by an independent institutional review board
(Health Research and Studies Center, Palo Alto, Califor-
nia), and all participants provided informed consent.
Data collection
For the Multiple Supp users, online questionnaires were
used to obtain information about height, annual house-
hold income, education, medical history and current
medical conditions, and current dietary supplement
usage. Questions about medical history and current med-
ical conditions were patterned after questions asked in
NHANES 2001­2002 [6]. The dietary supplement ques-
tionnaire included 57 dietary supplements and foods sold
by Shaklee in 2005 and asked about usual intake in the
previous 12 months. The questionnaire included four
intake frequency categories including 'rarely or never
used,' '1­3 days per week,' '4­6 days per week,' and 'every
day,' and also asked about usual serving size.
Physical examinations were conducted during a national
meeting of Shaklee product consumers held in Chicago,
Illinois in August 2005. Data collection took place
between July and August of 2005. Body weight was meas-
ured using a physician's scale with shoes and heavy cloth-
ing removed. Triplicate blood pressure measurements
were taken by an automated Welch Allyn device (Model
5201) with an appropriate-sized cuff after subjects were
seated quietly in a chair for 2 minutes, with feet on the
ground and with the arm at the level of the heart. Twelve-
hour fasting blood samples were collected, processed,
aliquoted and stored frozen at -80°C. Samples were
assayed for red blood cell (RBC) folate, serum ascorbic
acid stabilized using 10% metaphosphoric acid, alpha
tocopherol, carotenoids, retinol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipids, and homo-
cysteine (Table 1). Assay procedures followed those that
were utilized in NHANES 2001­2002 and in NHANES III
[6-12] as described in Table 1.
Multivitamin/mineral and non-supplement users from
NHANES
We used NHANES (NHANES III and 2001­2001) data as
a source of comparison data for multivitamin users and
non-users of supplements. NHANES is designed to moni-
tor the health and nutrition status of the US population
and participation consisted of an in-home interview and
Nutrition Journal 2007, 6:30 http://www.nutritionj.com/content/6/1/30

an examination in the NHANES mobile examination unit
[6]. Dietary supplement intake was assessed in NHANES
by asking participants about their dietary supplement
usage patterns in the past 30 days prior to their home
interview, including use of any vitamins, minerals, or
other dietary supplements. NHANES oversamples certain
groups, such as older people and low-income individuals,
in order to obtain greater precision in estimates for those
groups; sample weights are applied by NHANES to adjust
for oversampling and nonresponse. NHANES sample
selection involves a stratified multistage probability
design involving counties, blocks, and households. Con-
sequently, variance estimates require use of special soft-
ware making use of NHANES strata and primary sampling
units to account for the sampling design.
To match the age and race composition of the Multiple
Supp users, we selected from NHANES 2001­2002 partic-
ipants all of the White men and women, >35 years of age,
and free of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer,
who met certain supplement use criteria. Only non-sup-
plement users and users of supplements containing vita-
mins and/or minerals were included for the present
analysis. We identified 602 NHANES participants who
consumed no dietary supplements in the 30 days prior to
the home interview; these became the 'No Supp' users. We
also identified 176 individuals who consumed a multivi-
tamin/mineral and no other dietary supplements, and did
so at least 15 days over the past 30 days. These became the
'Single Supp' users. To obtain the most recent data possi-
ble for comparative purposes, RBC folate, and serum fer-
ritin, homocysteine, CRP, and lipid data were obtained
from NHANES 2001­2002 [7]. However, serum retinol,
ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol, and serum carotenoid
data were not available from NHANES 2001­2002 or
2003­2004. Therefore, data for these variables for Single
Supp and No Supp users who were White, >35 years of
age, and free of cancer other than non-melanoma skin
cancer were obtained from NHANES III, 1988­1994
[8,9]. The geographical distribution of the individuals in
the three users groups is not known. In addition, the dura-
tion of dietary supplement usage by NHANES partici-
pants, aside from the 30 days prior to their home
interview, is unknown.
Statistical analyses
After combining the Multiple Supp users with the Single
Supp and No Supp users from NHANES, data were
reweighted. The weights for the NHANES groups were cal-
culated by dividing each NHANES weight by the sum of
the NHANES weights of the user group. Appropriate
weights were used depending on whether the data came
from the interview or the Mobile Examination Center.
Multiple Supp users were assigned a weight of 1. Strata
and primary sampling units from NHANES were used for
those user groups. For the Multiple Supp users, a new stra-
tum variable was assigned, and each member of the Mul-
tiple Supp group was assigned to a unique primary
sampling unit. These adjustments permit more accurate
variance estimates and account for stratification factors.
However, the Single Supp and No Supp users from
NHANES should not be interpreted as being nationally
representative samples. Calculations used SUDAAN Ver-

Research Triangle Park, North Carolina).
Differences in the characteristics of the supplement user
groups were evaluated using chi-square methods for cate-
gorical variables and one-way analysis of variance for con-
tinuous variables. Multiple regression techniques were
employed to examine differences in nutrient and biomar-
ker concentrations of user groups. Comparisons of mean
nutrient concentrations among user groups (RBC folate,
and serum retinol, ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol, caro-
tenoids, and ferritin) were adjusted for sex and age. Com-
parisons of biomarker concentrations among user groups
(serum homocysteine, CRP, total cholesterol, and lipids)
were further adjusted for age2, education category (<high
school, high school graduate, or >high school), income
category (<$30,000, $30,000 and <$40,000, $40,000
and <$50,000, $50,000 and <$60,000, $60,000 and
<$70,000, and $70,000) and income2, and body mass
index (BMI). For outcomes treated as dichotomous varia-
bles, logistic regression methods were used to estimate
odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI),
adjusted for sex, age and age2, education category, income
category and income2, and BMI. The model fit was exam-
ined using the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit
test. The referent group for risk estimation was the No
Supp user group. Statistical significance was defined as p
< 0.05.
Elevated blood pressure was defined as >80 mmHg for
diastolic and/or >120 mmHg for systolic blood pressure
[13]. Suboptimal and elevated nutrient and biomarker
concentrations were defined as: <317 nmol/L RBC folate
[14,15]; <37.5 nmol/L and >600 nmol/L for serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [16-19]; >9 µmol/L for serum homo-
cysteine [20]; >3.0 mg/L for serum CRP [21]; 200 mg/dL
for serum total cholesterol [22]; <40 mg/dL for serum
high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol for men and
<50 mg/dL for women [22]; 130 mg/dL for serum low-
density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol [22]; <5 for the
ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol [22]; 150
mg/dL for serum triglycerides [22]; and <0.4 mg/dL and
>1.0 mg/dL for ascorbic acid [23,24].
Results
Significant differences by user group were found for sex,
age, BMI, education, and household income (Table 2).
The proportion female increased with increasing degree of
supplement use. The two supplement user groups were
older than the No Supp users, and had lower BMI. Multi-
ple Supp users were well-educated with 86% having
greater than a high school education compared to approx-
imately 55% in the other two user groups. The proportion
with annual household incomes less than $30,000 was
19.7% and 17.3% in the No Supp and Single Supp users
respectively, and 2.5% in the Multiple Supp group. Partic-
ipants were predominately White because of the racial
composition of the Multiple Supp users and the fact that
Single Supp and No Supp users were matched to Multiple
Supp users on race.
Dietary supplement usage patterns
By definition, No Supp users consumed no supplements
and Single Supp users consumed only a multivitamin/
mineral dietary supplement and did so approximately
every other day or more often. Multiple Supp users

reported taking an average of 25 different supplements in
the past 12 months (median, 26), and took an average of
17 different supplements every day (median, 18) (data
not shown). Dietary supplements consumed on a daily
basis by more than 50% of both male and female Multiple
Supp users included a multivitamin/mineral, B-complex,
vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium with vitamin D, a herbal
immune supplement, carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids,
flavonoids, lecithin, coenzyme Q10 with resveratrol,
alfalfa, and glucosamine (Table 3). In addition, a majority
of women also consumed gamma linolenic acid and a
probiotic supplement, whereas men also consumed zinc,
garlic, a soy protein supplement, and saw palmetto daily.
Serum nutrient and biomarker concentrations
There was a statistically significant increase in RBC folate
and serum concentrations of ascorbic acid, alpha and beta
carotene, and alpha tocopherol with degree of supple-
mentation use (Table 4). For these nutrients, Single Supp
users had significantly higher nutrient concentrations
than No Supp users, and Multiple Supp users had higher
concentrations than the Single Supp group. Serum retinol
was higher among Single and Multiple Supp users com-
pared to No Supp users. Among women, serum ferritin
was highest in Multiple Supp users and lower in the Single
Supp users compared to No Supp users. Among men,
serum ferritin was significantly lower in the Multiple Supp
users compared to the two other supplement groups.
There was a decrease in concentrations of biomarkers
associated with disease risk as supplement use increased
(Table 4). Across the three user groups there was a
decrease in serum CRP and the ratio of total cholesterol to
HDL-cholesterol, and an increase in HDL-cholesterol con-
centration. Serum homocysteine and triglycerides were
lower in the Multiple Supp users than in the other two
groups. Finally, serum total cholesterol was significantly
lower in the Multiple Supp group, whereas LDL-choles-
terol concentrations did not vary significantly by supple-
ment use.
Among Multiple Supp users, no individuals had subopti-
mal or elevated serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentra-
tions (range: 39.3­263.8 nmol/L). No comparative 25-
hydroxyvitamin D data were available from NHANES. No
Multiple Supp users had suboptimal serum ascorbic acid
concentrations (<0.4 mg/dL), compared with 9.4%
among Single Supp users and 32.4% among the No Supp
group (data not shown). Similarly, 94.1% of Multiple
Supp users had serum ascorbic acid concentrations >1.0
mg/dL, compared with 46.6% of Single Supp users and
21.9% of No Supp users (data not shown).

Blood pressure and adverse biomarker concentrations
Adjusted risk estimates for elevated blood pressure and
suboptimal or elevated concentrations of serum biomark-
ers are reported in Table 5. Compared to No Supp users,
Multiple Supp users had significantly reduced risks of ele-
vated serum homocysteine, triglycerides, and ratio of total
cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol, and significantly reduced
risk of low HDL-cholesterol. For elevated serum CRP, the
risk among Multiple Supp users could not be estimated
because of the absence of any persons with elevated values
of CRP. Multiple Supp users also had a significantly
reduced risk of elevated blood pressure compared to No
Supp users. Single Supp users had significantly lower risks
of elevated serum homocysteine, and low serum HDL-
cholesterol. Risks of elevated serum total cholesterol and
LDL-cholesterol did not significantly differ across the sup-
plement user groups.
Health status and disease prevalence
Prevalence of self-reported disease was low in each user
group and most risk estimates did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (Table 6). An exception was the reduced risk of
diabetes in Multiple Supp users (OR = 0.27; 95% CI:
0.12­0.59). Risk of coronary heart disease was also lower
in this group (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.22­1.09), but was
only marginally statistically significant. For self-assessed
health status, Multiple Supp users, but not Single Supp
users, were less likely to report their health as 'good, fair,
or poor' versus 'excellent or very good' (OR = 0.26; 95%
CI: 0.17­0.41) compared to the No Supp users group
(Table 6).
Discussion
Little has been reported about daily users of multiple die-
tary supplements. We assembled a sample of long-term
users of multiple dietary supplements for the purpose of
describing their supplement usage patterns. On average,
Multiple Supp users in this study consumed 17 different
supplements every day. Dietary supplements consumed
on a daily basis by more than 50% of Multiple Supp users
included a multivitamin/mineral, B-complex, vitamin C,
carotenoids, vitamin E, calcium with vitamin D, omega-3
fatty acids, flavonoids, lecithin, alfalfa, coenzyme Q10
with resveratrol, glucosamine, and a herbal immune sup-
plement. Women also consumed gamma linolenic acid
and a probiotic supplement, whereas men also consumed
zinc, garlic, a soy protein supplement, and saw palmetto
(Table 2). By comparison, in NHANES 1999­2000, 52%

of those surveyed reported taking a dietary supplement in
the past 30 days; 35% reported having taken a multivita-
min/mineral; 12.7% having taken vitamin E; 12.4% hav-
ing taken vitamin C; 10.4% having taken calcium; and
5.2% having taken B-complex vitamins [4]. Consistent
with other reports describing dietary supplement users
[4], Multiple Supp users as a group were primarily White,
better educated, more affluent, and older.
A second objective of the study was to conduct a cross-sec-
tional comparison of the relevant biomarker and nutrient
concentrations in the Multiple Supp users, with those of
Single Supp users (multivitamin/mineral users) and No
Supp users (non-users) in NHANES 2001­20002 and
NHANES III. Nutrient concentrations in serum or RBC
generally increased across the three supplement user
groups. It is notable that Single Supp users had higher cir-
culating concentrations than No Supp users for RBC folate
and serum retinol, ascorbic acid, and alpha tocopherol.
This fact has important implications for nutrition inter-
vention trials, some of which have permitted participants,
including those in the control group, to take a multivita-
min/mineral supplement [25]. Our findings suggest that
this practice may weaken the power of trials to detect
treatment effects of the study supplement.
Degree of supplement use was associated with several
markers of disease risk. Elevated serum homocysteine
concentrations were found in approximately 45% of No
Supp users, 37% of Single Supp users, and 11% of Multi-
ple Supp users, despite the fact that the data were obtained
after the 1998 fortification of grain products with folate,

and despite the low prevalence of inadequate RBC folate
in any of the user groups. If moderately-elevated serum
homocysteine is shown to be an important cardiovascular
disease risk factor, the findings of this study suggest that
intake of the relevant B vitamins above what is typically
found in a multivitamin/mineral supplement, and/or the
diet, may produce a more favorable homocysteine-lower-
ing effect.
Circulating CRP concentration has been shown to be pre-
dictive of future cardiovascular disease risk in prospective
studies among asymptomatic individuals and may have a
direct effect on the progression of atherosclerosis [26]. In
the present study, serum CRP concentrations decreased
and serum ascorbic acid increased with increasing degree
of supplement use (Tables 2 and 4). This finding is con-
sistent with recent reports that vitamin C supplementa-
tion lowers plasma CRP concentrations [27], and that
dietary intakes of vitamin C and plasma ascorbic acid con-
centration are inversely associated with plasma CRP [28].
Studies are underway to confirm the impact of vitamin C
supplementation on circulating CRP and other markers of
immune function.
Serum ascorbic acid concentration >1.0 mg/dL has been
suggested as optimal relative to reduced risk of cardiovas-
cular disease and cancer [24]. By this definition, over 94%
of Multiple Supp had optimal concentrations, compared
to approximately 47% and 22% in Single Supp and No
Supp users, respectively. Suboptimal concentrations,
defined as <0.4 mg/dL [23], were not found in the Multi-
ple Supp user group, and were found in approximately
9% and 32% of Single Supp and No Supp users, respec-
tively.
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in Multiple Supp users is of
interest because of possible beneficial and adverse effects
from supplemental intake of vitamin D. Improving 25-
hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above the level associ-
ated with subclinical deficiency (<37.5 nmol/L) may
reduce the risk of skeletal fractures [16-19]. Also, parathy-
roid hormone concentrations become minimal when 25-
hydroxyvitamin D concentrations exceed 100 nmol/L.
Conversely, serum concentrations >600 nmol/L are asso-
ciated with hypercalcemia [19]. Among Multiple Supp
users, no individuals had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentrations <37.5 nmol/L or >600 nmol/L, and the
mean (SD) was 131.4 (45.26) nmol/L with a range of
39.30 to 263.80 nmol/L. No comparative data were avail-
able from NHANES participants.
Supplement use was also associated with lower serum
triglycerides and higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations.
In consequence, the risk of an elevated ratio of total cho-
lesterol to HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower in the
Multiple Supp group compared to the No Supp group
(Table 5). Prevalent use of fish oil supplements in the
Multiple Supp users may explain these findings as omega-
3 fatty acids in fish oil have been shown to increase HDL-
cholesterol and decrease triglyceride concentrations [29].
Although beyond the scope of the present study, lower
risk of cardiac arrhythmias may be another benefit of con-
sumption of omega-3 fatty acids [30,31].
Self-assessed health status has been found to be a remark-
ably good marker of prospective health outcomes [32].
Compared to No Supp users, Multiple Supp users were
more likely to describe their health as 'very good' or 'excel-

lent', whereas this was not the case with Single Supp users
(Table 6).
Risk of elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure was
significantly lower in the Multiple Supp group compared
to No Supp users, but not in Single Supp users compared
to No Supp users (Table 5). Dietary interventions have
been shown to reduce blood pressure [33]. However, clin-
ical trials of individual nutrients have typically found
small and inconsistent effects [33]. Dietary folate and vita-
min C, as well as plasma ascorbic acid, have been found
to be inversely associated with blood pressure in observa-
tional studies [34,35]. However, intervention trials with
vitamin C have yielded inconsistent results [35], while in
two small trials, folic acid has been effective at lowering
blood pressure [36,37]. The finding of a lower risk of ele-
vated blood pressure in the Multiple Supp group, which
also had the highest concentrations of RBC folate and
serum ascorbic acid, suggests that the relationship
between these nutrients and blood pressure may warrant
further investigation.
The lower risk of diabetes in the Multiple Supp group is
consistent with evidence that oxidative stress may be a
mechanism linking insulin resistance with dysfunction of
pancreatic beta cells and endothelial dysfunction, eventu-
ally leading to diabetes [38]. Although biomarkers of oxi-
dative stress were not available in the three user groups,
serum concentrations of antioxidants including ascorbic
acid, carotenoids, and alpha tocopherol were all signifi-
cantly higher in the Multiple Supp users compared to the
other groups (Table 2).
An important limitation of the study is the fact that the
data are cross-sectional, and therefore the reported associ-
ations, particularly with health outcomes (i.e., blood pres-
sure and diabetes), cannot presume causality. Also, the
three user groups should not be interpreted to represent
unbiased national estimates. In addition, although we
adjusted for potential confounders such as age, sex,
income, education, and BMI, residual confounding could
possibly account for the findings. Better access to health
care and variables related to higher socioeconomic status
in the supplement user groups (e.g., healthier diets and
lifestyles) are logical hypotheses that may account for
these results. However, the No Supp and Single Supp user
groups were similar with respect to education and income
(Table 2), so these factors may not explain the signifi-
cantly better nutrient and C-reactive protein concentra-
tions seen for Single Supp users in Table 4, and
homocysteine and HDL risk levels (Table 5). Further-
more, the lack of differences across the three user groups
in biomarkers such as serum total cholesterol and LDL-
cholesterol suggest that factors related to health care
access and socioeconomic status do not fully explain the
results.
This study is the first we are aware of to describe the usage
patterns of long-term users of multiple dietary supple-
ments, an unusual sample that cannot be captured in
national representative surveys. While only 3 individuals
out of over 11,000 surveyed in NHANES 2001­2002 had
taken 20 or more kinds of dietary supplements in the past
30 days, in our Multiple Supp users, 87% of the sample
reported having taken 20 or more kinds of supplements
daily. Thus, this sample of Multiple Supp users affords a
rare opportunity to understand a segment of the popula-
tion that take multiple dietary supplements, and to under-
stand the nutrient and other correlates of this practice. In
addition, Multiple Supp users were long-term consumers
of dietary supplements. Thus, their serum nutrient and
biomarker concentrations were likely to be representative
of their long-term supplementation patterns.
Conclusion
This sample of long-term users of multiple dietary supple-
ments was found to consume a broad array of vitamin/
mineral, herbal, and condition-specific dietary supple-
ments on a daily basis. They were more likely to have opti-
mal concentrations of biomarkers associated with
reduced disease risk, and less likely to have suboptimal
circulating nutrient concentrations, elevated blood pres-
sure, and diabetes than multivitamin/mineral users and
non-users. There was no evidence that intake of vitamin D
in multiple supplement users was excessive based on
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. These find-
ings should be confirmed by studying the dietary supple-
ment usage patterns and health and nutrition status of
other groups of heavy users of dietary supplements. Our
study findings should also be weighed in the context of
recent randomized controlled trials and related meta-
analyses [39,40] which have raised concern about poten-
tial detrimental effects of select dietary supplements, par-
ticularly beta carotene and alpha tocopherol. While the
typical daily intake of beta carotene from supplements in
the Multiple Supp group was low relative to those studies
(approximately 5000 IU/d of vitamin A as beta carotene),
the typical intake of alpha tocopherol was 800 IU/d, sim-
ilar to the dose in a number of randomized trials. Further
research on usage patterns of dietary supplements and the
potential health effects of dietary supplements is needed.
The present report serves as a baseline to which the find-
ings of subsequent monitoring efforts can be compared.
