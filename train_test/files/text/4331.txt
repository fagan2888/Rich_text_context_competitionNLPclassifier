Abstract: This study sought to determine if we could identify a cadre of educational
professionals with sufficient knowledge and acceptance of biological evolution to objectively
evaluate the merits of the emerging discipline of evolutionary educational psychology. Members
of APA and AERA were recruited to complete surveys measuring demographic characteristics,
evolution knowledge (specifically natural selection), and evolution acceptance. We tested a
model representing propensity toward open-minded examination of the merits of evolutionary
educational psychology. Results showed evolution knowledge and acceptance, personal beliefs,
academic and research experience, were key indicators of willingness to engage in objective
evaluation of this new discipline. We conclude that there are a number of educational
professionals with sufficient levels of evolution knowledge and acceptance to evaluate the
plausibility and applicability of this new perspective.

Introduction
A burgeoning area of research posits that our phylogenic history may have important
implications for cognition and learning (see Carlson and Levin, 2007, 2008). From a phylogenic
perspective, humans have evolved certain anatomical and physiological configurations which
result in cognitive attributes that influence learning (Gazzaniga, 2008). Our anatomical and
cognitive structures equip us to make sense of the world beginning in the early stages of
development (Gazzaniga, 2008). For example, "naïve theories," evident as early as infancy,
which may have been selected for their usefulness in thinking and reasoning in natural
environments, place constraints on learning in academic and informal educational settings.
Developmentalists describe major milestones in learning as the process of overcoming the
constraints posed by naïve theories (Kelemen, 1999). Geary (2007, 2008) similarly describes
how learners are endowed with "intuitive biases" or "folk knowledge" of biology, mathematics,
physics, and psychology. Geary argues that folk knowledge or naïve theories form a basis for
learning and can facilitate some learning tasks, such as the acquisition of language. The learning
Knowledge and acceptance
of more complex concepts, such as those associated with mathematics or physics, may be
hampered by the presence of folk knowledge or naïve theories. These findings are leading to the
emergence of a new discipline, "evolutionary educational psychology" (Carlson and Levin,
2007).
Evolutionary educational psychology seeks to understand learning as an evolved ability.
One goal of this emerging discipline is to understand how the evolution of human cognition
differentially impacts domains of study. Specifically, it is speculated that domains that build on
the fundamentals of our folk knowledge of psychology, biology, and physics are considered to be
biologically primary because interactions within these domains have been of fundamental
importance to survival (Geary, 2008). Applying this same line of reasoning, it is postulated that
domains stemming from cultural inventions such as reading, algebra, or Newtonian physics pose
different challenges for learning and motivation. Since these areas of study extend well beyond
our evolved learning skill set they are considered to be biologically secondary.
Evolutionary educational psychology seeks to understand the advantages of learning in
these domains, but also the challenges of overcoming cognitive biases associated with the
corresponding foundational folk knowledge. These biases may have developed to provide useful
shorthand techniques for recognizing and categorizing objects and others in the environment, but
when in contradiction with scientific knowledge in the disciplines, biases may lead to the
development of misconceptions. For example, infants are very good at recognizing faces, but our
amazing ability to recognize faces may lead to a tendency to superimpose faces when they are
not there (such as the face many perceive as the "man in moon"). Thus, biologically primary
content may be easy to learn but comes with "baggage" that makes overcoming the associated
potential biases pedagogically challenging.
An understanding of the evolved nature of our learning skills and motivational
dispositions in the context of different domains may be used to develop more effective
instruction. The application of evolutionary educational psychology in the context of domain
knowledge can be illustrated by the following example. Children acquire oral language, a
biologically primary skill, with relative ease and therefore tend to require less formal instruction
to learn to speak, whereas reading, a biologically secondary skill, tends to require systematic
structured instruction and sustained effort on the part of the learner to acquire proficiency. The
recognition of these domain differences and other aspects of learning that can be understood
using an evolution-based perspective supports the possible utility of evolutionary educational
psychology.
The increasing reference to evolutionary psychology in cognition research and the
associated theory refinement raises the question of whether there is a cadre of researchers or
university instructors in education domains (what we call educational professionals) with
sufficient comprehension and acceptance of biological evolution to adequately and objectively
evaluate the merits and validity of this perspective. We contend that this requires experience with
scientific research and a working knowledge of and openness to biological evolution. To our
knowledge, educational professionals' levels of understanding and acceptance of biological
evolution levels have never been documented.

Knowledge and acceptance
Knowledge and acceptance of evolution
Developments in evolutionary educational psychology provide justification to examine
educational professionals' preparedness to evaluate the merits and plausibility of this
perspective. Despite the volumes of evidence supporting the scientific explanation of biological
evolution (Dawkins, 1996; Gould, 2002; Miller, 1999) and the abundance of educational
materials available to support teaching evolution (Alters and Alters, 2001; National Academy of
Sciences [NAS], 1999), research shows that the scientific understanding of biological evolution
continues to remain elusive to many (Alters and Alters, 2001; Gallup, 2008). It is argued that
evolution is complex and controversial, accounting for why it is either poorly taught or not
taught at all in many K-12 settings (Alters and Alters, 2001; Catley, 2006; NAS, 1999).
However, studying biology in post-secondary education increases the opportunity to gain deeper
understanding of evolution (Alters and Nelson, 2002; Lawson and Worsnop, 1992). This
suggests that the number of college level biology courses completed by an individual is a
potential indicator of preparedness to evaluate the merits of evolution-based research.
Working knowledge of biological evolution requires the acceptance of natural selection
and descent with modification as plausible scientific explanations for speciation and an
understanding of the associated variables and processes (Alters and Alters, 2001; Gallup, 2008;
Rutledge and Warden, 1999). An accurate understanding of the processes that make up the
structure of evolutionary theory is required to effectively generate related models and hypotheses
(Alters, 2004; McComas, 2006). We contend that more accurate conceptions of biological
evolution enhance the capacity to comprehend and evaluate the plausibility of evolutionary
educational psychology. Since advanced courses in biology or evolution are not required for a
terminal degree in psychology, educational psychology, or most education fields, it is worth
asking whether educational professionals are sufficiently prepared with knowledge of evolution
to effectively understand or scientifically evaluate evolutionary educational psychology.
Miller, Scott, and Okamoto (2006) report that the majority of individuals in the United
States do not believe in (accept) evolution, which is typically viewed as different from
understanding evolution (Rutledge and Warden, 1999; Smith and Siegel, 2004; Southerland,
Sinatra, and Matthews, 2001). It has been argued that belief and knowledge are sufficiently
different constructs that both must be examined when considering individuals' perspectives on
evolution (Shtulman, 2006; Southerland et al., 2001). Those that make this distinction posit that
belief is based on faith, whereas knowledge is acquired through observations, logical proof, or
empirical evidence (Smith, 1994; Southerland et al., 2001). The distinction may be critical
because as Palmquist and Finley (1997) report, professional scientists transitioning to careers in
education had difficulty distinguishing their beliefs from their knowledge. Research on
acceptance and knowledge of evolution has revealed these constructs to be either associated
(Nadelson and Southerland, under review; Rutledge and Mitchell, 2002) or independent (Bishop
and Anderson, 1990; Demastes, Settlage, and Good, 1995; Lawson and Worsnop, 1992; Sinatra,
Southerland, McConaughy, and Demastes, 2003). The variation in results from research supports
the need to investigate these two constructs with our population of interest.
The strong association between acceptance of evolution and belief systems makes
individual attitudes toward evolution resistant to change (Southerland and Sinatra, 2003). Over

Knowledge and acceptance
the course of instruction, evolution acceptance is not anticipated to change to the same degree as
evolution knowledge (Lawson and Worsnop, 1992). We argue that acceptance of evolution
would be predictive of an individual's motivation to engage in the objective evaluation of the
merits of evolutionary educational psychology. We contend that rejection of the theory of
biological evolution would impede an individual's willingness to give full consideration to this
perspective. Individual consideration of whether to accept or reject evolutionary educational
psychology requires willingness to objectively examine the idea as plausible, compelling, and
comprehensible (Dole and Sinatra, 1998).
Religiosity and evolution
Despite an abundance of evidence supporting the scientific explanation of biological
evolution, the majority of individuals in the U.S. neither understands nor accepts the theory
(Gallup, 2008: Miller, 1999). Recent Gallup polls (2008) indicate about 80% of Americans
believe humans develop only with the influence of God. This reveals perhaps one of the
strongest indicators of evolution rejection, an individual's level of religious commitment, also
known as religiosity (Alters and Alters, 2001; Mazur, 2004 Miller, 1999; Scott, 2005). The
significance of the relationship between acceptance and religiosity is made evident by the anti-
evolution movements that have been motivated by individuals who hold strong religious beliefs
(Alters and Alters, 2001; Scott, 2005). Although anti-evolution activities have been documented
primarily in the United States, recent reports indicate similar movements are occurring in Europe
(Graebsch and Schiermeir, 2006) and in Australia (Sutherland, 2005). Lack of evolution
acceptance and resistance to learning about the theory are often due to individuals' religious
convictions that may conflict with the scientific perspective on humans' phylogenetic
relationships to other organisms (Alters and Alters, 2001).
The acceptance or rejection of evolution based on religious perspectives is
psychologically analogous to situations in which personal beliefs influence the decision to
engage in the consideration of new evidence or perspectives (Kuhn, 1999). The influence and
application of personal conceptions or beliefs on decision making can impede the ability to
reason scientifically (Tversky and Kahneman, 1982). Kuhn contends that individuals' inability to
recognize the influence of their personal beliefs on the evaluation of evidence and concepts
constrains their capacity for objective scientific reasoning. Biases against evolution may
contribute to the development and reinforcement of fallacies about the theory. The documented
association between the rejection of the theory of evolution and levels of religiosity (Alters and
Alters, 2002; Trani, 2004) suggests that the constructs interact to impede impartiality required
for objective evaluation. The documented influence of religious beliefs on the willingness to
consider evolution-based conjectures provides warrant for assessing levels of religiosity in our
population of interest.
Evaluating scientific research
Professional experience conducting and evaluating research enhances the domain-general
abilities to analyze evidence, scrutinize research methodology, and judge logical arguments
supporting new perspectives (Schauble, 1996). The ability to apply scientific reasoning skills that
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -493-
Knowledge and acceptance
are both domain-specific and domain-general is particularly important with evolutionary
educational psychology which combines content domains, sources of evidence, research
methodologies, and logical arguments (Carlson and Levin, 2007).
Assessing an individual's knowledge and capability to effectively and objectively weigh
scientific evidence regarding evolution is a relatively complex process. There are, however,
factors which may serve as proxies for assessing domain-general scientific reasoning capacity.
We contend that experience judging evidence (Schunn and Anderson, 1999), conducting
research (Kuhn, Amsel, and O'Loughlin, 1988) and evaluating research (Schoenfeld, 1985), are
indicators of capacity for effective decision making.
The ability to evaluate scientific research requires expertise in analyzing and critiquing
scientific evidence, hypotheses, and theories (Hogan and Maglienti, 2001; Kuhn et al., 1988;
Kuhn and Pearsall, 2000). Acquiring expertise in evaluating scientific research is a long term
process of developing understanding of when and how to attend to critical variables, explain
effects, interpret data, and test hypotheses systematically (Klahr and Simon, 1999; Schoenfeld,
1985). This suggests that the development of the domain-general ability to effectively evaluate
scientific research is influenced by exposure and opportunity to engage in and review scientific
investigations. Therefore, it stands to reason that increases in educational professionals'
academic rank, highest held degree, institutional responsibility, experience with researching or
teaching of science, and years of academic experience, would be accompanied by a
corresponding increase in the domain-general capacity to effectively evaluate scientific research.
This relationship provides justification for assessing professional academic histories and
characteristics.
Scientific reasoning
Advances in science require experts to be informed and prepared to reason scientifically
to accurately examine and critique new developments (Kuhn, 1970). Sadler and Zeidler (2004)
report greater domain-specific content knowledge results in higher quality reasoning abilities.
This suggests that scientific reasoning is domain-specific, with individuals' abilities to
understand explanations and supporting evidence within a field constrained by their content
knowledge. The domain specificity of scientific reasoning is supported by research suggesting
individuals can effectively evaluate evidence in some domains but not in others (Schoenfeld,
1985).
We argue that scientific reasoning is best viewed as a combination of domain-general
reasoning ability resulting from engagement in the research enterprise (Kuhn et al., 1995;
Schauble, 1996), and domain-specific abilities based on content knowledge (Hogan and
Magleinti, 2001; Schoenfeld, 1985). Therefore, we posit that the ability to objectively evaluate
the merits of evolutionary educational psychology is dependent on individuals' domain-specific
knowledge of the theory of evolution, and their domain-general professional scientific research
and academic experiences.
Study objectives
The purpose of our study was to determine the propensity for a sample of members of
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -494-
Knowledge and acceptance
educational professional organizations in the USA to engage in the objective consideration of the
merits or shortcomings of evolutionary educational psychology. Our research assessed
participants' key personal characteristics, level of religious commitment, research and academic
experience, knowledge of evolution (specifically understanding of the process of biological
change through natural selection), and levels of acceptance of the theory of evolution. The
measured data was used to form a structural model representing educational professionals'
preparedness and willingness to objectively examine the validity and credibility of evolutionary
educational psychology.
The questions guiding this investigation were:
1. What are the levels of acceptance and knowledge of evolution held by this sample of
educational professionals?
2. What is the relationship among participants' knowledge of evolution, acceptance of
evolution, and levels of religiosity?
3. How do levels of acceptance and knowledge of evolution vary among the participants
in relation to their academic rank, years of academic work, primary academic
responsibility, and highest held degree?
4. Do academic experience, individual characteristics, evolution knowledge and
acceptance relate to the willingness and ability to objectively consider the plausibility
and coherence of evolution-based conjectures?
Methods
Participants
Study participants were 337 educational professionals recruited through their
membership in Division 15 (Educational Psychology) of the American Psychological
Association (APA), and Division C (Learning and Instruction) of the American Educational
Research Association (AERA). The membership of these two organizations is composed in large
part of professors, doctoral level researchers, and other graduate students, with primary
professional involvement in teaching or research in education or educational psychology. We
anticipated the members of AERA Division C and APA Division 15 were to be most likely to
encounter situations in which they would be evaluating the merits of evolutionary educational
psychology; therefore, we limited our sampling to membership of these two Divisions.
A total of 406 individuals completed the demographics survey, but only 337 completed
all three of the study surveys. To maintain confidentiality we did not ask participants to identify
their professional affiliation, therefore, we were not able to determine the proportion of the APA
Division 15 or AERA Division C membership that responded. However, our goal was not to
achieve a representative sample of the population, but instead, to determine if there was a cadre
of education professionals prepared to evaluate the plausibility of evolutionary educational
psychology.
Data analysis was conducted on the 337 participants who completed all surveys and
provided us with full data sets. Of the 337 valid responses, approximately 60% were female and
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -495-
Knowledge and acceptance
40% were male. The greater number of women than men in our sample was representative of the
gender distribution found in the field of education (Organization for Economic and Co-operation
and Development, 2004). Sixty-seven percent held either a Ph.D. or Ed.D. The majority of the
participants' degrees were in education, psychology, or educational psychology. About 40% of
our respondents indicated that research was their primary institutional activity, 30% indicated
teaching, with the remaining 30% indicating administration, service to patients, and other
activities (such as graduate student or retired). Almost 45% were tenured or tenure track. Over
half had either taken zero or one undergraduate biology course and 80% indicated having taken
no graduate level biology courses. The average number of biology courses reported taken by the
sample was 5.26 (SD = 4.79) and the median was 4.0. Over 50% had conducted research in
science, science education, or science learning. The average age was 45.37 years (SD = 13.82).

Materials and Procedures
The leadership of both APA Division 15 and AERA Division C distributed an e-mail to
the organizations' list-serves requesting members' participation in our study. The letter detailed
the intent of our investigation and provided a link to a web page that contained instructions for
participation, a link to our consent form, and links to our study measures.

All surveys were administered and data collected through Zoomerang, an internet based
secure survey web site. Participation was anonymous. Those who did participate were asked to
provide the same last five digits of any phone number for each measure which we used as a
unique code in our data analysis to track individual responses to our three study measures.
Participants were requested to consent to partake in the study and then complete our
Knowledge and acceptance

demographics survey and two study instruments. We used a series of web pages to guide
participants through the completion of the surveys, starting with the informed consent, followed
by demographics, which included our religious beliefs questions.
Our demographics survey was used to gather personal characteristics data, including
gender, ethnicity, highest academic degree, academic rank, and years of academic experience
and educational background. We also included items that asked participants to rate their
familiarity with the theory of evolution (a measure of participants' perceptions of their general
evolution knowledge), level of religious commitment (a measure of religiosity), personal
perceptions of the importance of religion (a measure of religiosity), and perceived level of
conflict between their individual religious views and personal acceptance of evolution (a
measure of evolution acceptance) an item similar to one used by Evans and colleagues (2007).
The participants were asked to respond to these four items using a five point Likert scale, with 1
indicating the lowest degree to which the statement was true and 5 the highest degree in which
the statement was true. See Table 2 for the average responses to these items.
Once the participants completed our demographics survey, they were directed to the
Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) (Rutledge and Warden, 1999). This
20-item evolution acceptance questionnaire is scored from 20-100 possible points, with 20 being
the lowest level of acceptance and 100 being the highest level of acceptance. The MATE uses
items such as, "The theory of evolution is incapable of being scientifically tested," and five point
Likert scale with responses ranging from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree." In the
instrument validation study of participating high school teachers, the reliability of the instrument
was determined to be 0.98. The high level of internal reliability reported from previous studies,
the construct validation confirmed with high school biology teachers, and the instrument's
measure of evolution acceptance, suggest that the MATE was appropriate for use in our study.
The corresponding scores and categories for acceptance are; 89-100, Very High Acceptance; 77-
88, High Acceptance; 65-76 Moderate Acceptance; 53-64, Low Acceptance; and 20-52, Very
Low Acceptance (Rutledge, 1996).
Following the completion of the MATE instrument, the participants were directed to the
Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS) (Anderson, Fisher, and Norman, 2002). The
20 item CINS instrument uses scenarios and corresponding selected response items to assess
knowledge of natural selection, which is a fundamental concept of the theory of evolution
(Gould, 2002; Miller, 1999). There are multiple processes guiding evolution, however, natural
selection is an essential and dominant mechanism. The salience of natural selection to the
understanding of evolution provided justification for inferring our participants' general
knowledge of evolution based on their CINS scores. Further, there is a dearth of extant
instruments available to assess general knowledge of evolution. Therefore, we used the CINS, an
instrument with established reliability and validity, to assess our participants' knowledge of
natural selection and infer their general knowledge of evolution from these scores.
In the development of their instrument, Anderson et al. (2002) assessed undergraduate
students targeting a level of difficulty of 50%, and achieved a level of 46.4% correct. This
indicates that individuals with a science background similar to that of an undergraduate would be
expected to answer about 50% of the questions on the CINS correctly. In their description of the
Knowledge and acceptance
CINS instrument Anderson and colleagues reported sufficient construct validity and adequate
levels of reliability (KR20
= .64). The validation with undergraduates with limited biology
knowledge, the demonstration of instrument internal reliability, and the assessment of knowledge
of natural selection supports the use of the CINS as an appropriate assessment of participants'
knowledge of evolution. Once the CINS was completed the participants were directed to a web
page which thanked them for their participation and again provided them with our contact
information.
Results
Instrument reliability
We began our analyses with a determination of the reliability of the MATE and the
CINS. Our analysis of the MATE began with recoding the reverse coded items. Maintaining the
five point Likert scale, the SPSS based internal reliability analysis produced a Cronbach's alpha
value of .96, indicating a high level of instrument reliability.
The CINS responses where recoded to dichotomous values of 0 for incorrect and 1 for
correct. Although it is appropriate to apply the Kuder-Richardson-20 test of reliability for
dichotomous data, the outcome and process used in SPSS for the calculation of the KR-20 and
Cronbach's alpha resulted in the same values. The Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis of the
CINS using SPSS resulted in a value of .86, indicating that for our application the instrument
was revealed to have a high degree of internal reliability.
Religiosity views
Our participants responded to the question regarding their level of religious commitment
with a mean of 2.66 (SD = 1.35) which would fall between "minimally religious" and "somewhat
religious" on our Likert scale (see Table 2). Approximately 49% of participants responded as
"not religious" or "minimally religious," 21% responded as "somewhat religious," and 31%
responded with "religious" or "very religious". It is interesting to note that the participants were
nearly equally distributed on the five point scale, which indicates that our sample includes
individuals with a broad range of religious commitment. In an effort to provide a context for
interpreting our participants' level of religiosity and to establish a reference for future analysis,
we made an attempt to compare the religiosity of our sample to outcomes from Gallup (2008)
and other reports of various behavior measures associated with religious commitment of the
general public (e.g. church attendance). However, we could not locate any data that were similar
enough to allow for a direct comparison of the religious commitment of our sample and the
general public.

The distribution of participants' responses to our question regarding personal importance
of religion was very similar to our item assessing perceived religious commitment. The average
of 2.95 (SD = 1.47) placed our participants very near "somewhat important" for our measure of
the personal importance of religion (see Table 2). The similarity in responses to our importance
of religion item and the previous item examining religious commitment provided evidence of
consistency in our measures of religiosity. The correlation between religious commitment and
importance of religion was r(337) = .90, p < .01. This indicated there was a high level of shared
variance between these two items. The high level of correlation between these items provided
justification for combining the two measures to form a single composite variable representing of
our participants' levels of religiosity.
Acceptance and knowledge
We began our main analyses of interest by examining our first research question: What
are the levels of acceptance and knowledge of evolution held by this sample of educational
professionals? The MATE measure of evolution acceptance uses a scale of 20 (representing no
acceptance) to 100 (representing full acceptance). Over 75% of our participants scored in the 80
to 100 range on the MATE. This indicates that the majority of our participants rated their level of
acceptance of the theory of evolution as High to Very High acceptance (Rutledge, 1996). The
mean score of our 337 participants, 87.77 (SD = 13.41), was significantly higher [t(887) = 16.52,
p < .01] than the levels of acceptance of a previous study that examined the acceptance of
evolution of 552 high school biology teachers in which Rutledge and Warden (2000) reported a
mean of 77.59 (SD = 4.26) on the same scale. This indicates that participants in our sample had
significantly higher levels of acceptance of the theory of evolution than the biology teachers
assessed in a prior study. This was intriguing since our participants reported taking about half the
number of college level biology courses on average (M = 5.26, Mdn = 4.0 SD = 4.79) than
recommended for biology teacher certification (National Science Teacher Association, 1992).
See Table 2 for the means and standards deviations of the MATE.

Knowledge and acceptance
To further assess acceptance of evolution we examined the response to our single item
which asked participants to rate the compatibility between their religious beliefs and evolution.
Approximately 78% of our sample indicated "compatible" or "very compatible" with a mean of
3.97 (SD = 1.15) placing them near "compatible" on our Likert scale. In comparison, a Gallup
(2008) survey of the U.S. public with regard to their perspectives of evolution, creation and
religion, reported that about 35% of the U.S. public expressed personal views in the context of
evolution indicating they perceived that science and religion conflict with each other. It is
important to note that the wording of the questions can result in shifts in the percentages of
acceptance responses. Overall, the polls reflect relatively little change in acceptance over the past
40 years. This indicates that a greater proportion of our study participants perceive no conflict
between science and religion than one would expect to find in the general public. This is a
notable finding as it indicates a higher degree of comfort level with evolution and personal
beliefs than we would most likely detect in the general public. Again, comparing the perspectives
of our participants and the general public is important to establishing a frame of reference for the
outcome on our measure of compatibility.
We conducted a correlation analysis to determine the consistency of the acceptance of
evolution outcomes from the MATE and our item asking participants' to rate the level of
compatibility between evolution and their religious beliefs. The results revealed the MATE was
positively correlated with our measure of compatibility of religious views and the scientific view
of evolution, r(337) = .49, p < .01. This indicated that these two measures had some consistency.
However, over 75% of the shared variance remained unaccounted for, indicating that our
measures also assessed some unique aspects of evolution acceptance.
Analysis of the CINS, our measure of evolution knowledge (inferred from knowledge of
natural selection), revealed that approximately 65% answered correctly on 75% or more of the
questions. Anderson et al. (2002) reported that the CINS instrument was designed to have a 50%
correct targeted level of difficulty, and achieved a 46.4% correct with a large sample of
undergraduates. In comparison our sample had a mean of 77.05% correct (SD = 21.25%), which
was greater than the expected 50% targeted level of difficulty. This indicates that the majority of
our participants scored above the average expected levels of understanding of natural selection
(our measure of knowledge of evolutionary processes) for this instrument. See Table 2 for the
means and standards deviations of the CINS.
To extend our assessment of evolution knowledge we examined the responses to our
single item which asked participants to rate their familiarity with the theory of evolution. The
participants self-reported a perceived average level of familiarity with evolution of 3.62 (SD =
.91) which fell between "somewhat familiar" and "familiar" on our Likert scale. All 337 of our
participants rated their familiarity at or above "minimally familiar" with 32% responding at
"somewhat familiar," 38% at "familiar," and about 18% at "very familiar." We were unable to
locate any appropriately similar studies that we could justify using for comparison to the general
population, but our awareness of research on levels of evolution knowledge suggests our
participants considered themselves more familiar with evolution than the general public would
be likely to rate themselves (Alters and Alters, 2001; Miller, 1999; Scott, 2005).
To determine the extent of the relationship between our two measures of evolution
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -500-
Knowledge and acceptance
knowledge, we conducted a correlational analysis between the CINS and our single item
assessing familiarity with evolution. The results revealed the CINS was positively correlated
with our measure of evolution familiarity, r(337) = .27, p < .01. This indicated that these two
measures had some level of consistency. However, over 92% of the shared variance remained
unaccounted for indicating that these two measures were likely assessing nearly independent
aspects of evolution knowledge.
Relationship between acceptance, knowledge and religiosity
Our second research question asked: What is the relationship among participants'
knowledge of evolution, acceptance of evolution, and levels of religiosity? We examined the
correlations among participants' ages, years of academic experience, the religiosity composite,
MATE scores, the measure of compatibility of personal beliefs and evolution, the measure of
perceived familiarity of evolution, CINS scores, number of biology courses as variables, and
experience with research or teaching of science (see Table 3 for the correlation matrix). The
results revealed acceptance scores on the MATE to be significantly correlated with knowledge of
evolution (as measured by the CINS), r(337) = .38, p < .01. The MATE scores were also found
to be significantly correlated with perceived evolution familiarity, r(337) = .28, p < .01. Further,
the CINS was found to be positively significantly correlated with evolution compatible views,
r(337) = .35, p < .01. This indicated that as evolution acceptance increased there was a
corresponding increase in evolution knowledge, which is a relationship that has been
inconsistently detected in prior research on the association within populations of undergraduate
and graduate college students (Bishop and Anderson, 1990: Demastes et al., 1995; Lawson and
Worsnop, 1992; Nadelson and Southerland, under review; Rutledge and Mitchell, 2002; Sinatra
et al., 2003).
Consistent with other research in this area (Gallup, 2008; Trani, 2004), we found
religiosity to be significantly inversely correlated with acceptance of evolution (MATE scores),
r(337) = -.45, p < .01, and inversely correlated with compatibility of beliefs and evolution,
r(337) = -.12, p < .05, such that higher levels of reported religiosity were associated with lower
levels of reported acceptance and of evolution compatible views. In addition, religiosity was also
found to be significantly and negatively correlated with the CINS, r(337) = -.13, p < .05. It is
interesting to note that we failed to detect a correlation between religiosity and participants'
perception of their familiarity with evolution. Our results show that as religious commitment
increases there were significant decreases in both evolution acceptance and knowledge. This
corresponds with the interpretation of Gallup poll results (2008) which report that understanding
of evolution, acceptance, and level of religious commitment are related in the same directions as
found in this study.

Variations with academic experience
Our third research question asked: How do levels of acceptance and knowledge of
evolution vary among the participants in relation to their academic rank, years of academic
work, primary academic responsibility, and highest held degree?
Academic rank. We conducted an ANOVA to explore differences among the measures
with respect to academic rank. Levels of academic rank were used as the grouping factor and
acceptance of evolution, knowledge of evolution, level of religiosity, and experience with
research or teaching of science served as dependent measures. The results revealed significant
differences in the acceptance of evolution (MATE) depending on academic rank, F(5,331) =
5.97, p < .01. Post hoc analysis revealed that Instructors had significantly lower levels of
acceptance than Lecturers (p < .05), Assistant Professors (p < .05), Associate Professors (p <
.05), and Full Professors (p < .01). Further analysis of the pairwise comparisons revealed that
Graduate Students had significantly lower levels of acceptance of evolution than Assistant
Professors (p < .05) and, Full Professors (p < .01). All other post hoc comparisons were not
significant.
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -502-
Knowledge and acceptance
We then conducted an ANOVA to determine if compatibility of religious beliefs with
evolution differed by levels of academic rank. This result was significant F(5,331) = 3.19, p <
.01. The post hoc analysis identified Instructors as reporting significantly lower levels of
compatibility than Full Professors (p < .05). All other post hoc comparisons were not significant.
Knowledge of evolution (as measured by the CINS), familiarity of evolution, experience
with researching or teaching science, and levels of religiosity were not found to vary by
academic rank. The means and standard deviations for acceptance, knowledge, religiosity,
compatible beliefs, and engagement in science research and teaching by academic rank are
presented in Table 4.

Highest degree earned. To determine if measures of acceptance, knowledge, religiosity,
and experience with research or teaching science were related to highest degree obtained, we
conducted an ANOVA using the highest degree obtained as the grouping factor. The results of
this analysis revealed that levels of acceptance of evolution (MATE) varied with respect to the
highest degree obtained, F(5,331) = 7.35, p < .01. The post hoc analysis of MATE scores
revealed those holding a Ph.D. had significantly higher levels of acceptance than those holding a
M.A. (p < .01) or an M.Ed. degree (p < .01). The ANOVA also revealed significant differences
in levels of compatibility of religious beliefs with evolution by highest degree earned, F(5,331) =
2.46, p < .05. Post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between M.Ed. and Ph.D.
participants (p < .05). The nature of this difference was that those holding a Ph.D. had higher
levels of compatibility than the M.Ed. participants. The ANOVA examining evolution
knowledge (as measured by the CINS) by highest degree obtained was revealed to be significant,
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -503-
Knowledge and acceptance
F(5,331) = 3.85, p < .01. The post hoc analysis indicated that those holding a Ph.D. showed
significantly higher understanding scores than those holding M.A. degrees (p < .01). It is
interesting to note that the ANOVA examining perceptions of evolution familiarity, failed to
reach significance. This further confirmed our analysis that the CINS and evolution familiarly
were assessing different aspects of our participants' evolution knowledge.
We detected no significant differences for religiosity or experience with researching or
teaching science across degree groups. This led us to conclude that these measures were not
differentially distributed within the degree groups. The means and standard deviations for the
examined measures are presented in Table 5.

*Measure of the Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution, **Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection
Years of experience. We conducted a correlational analysis between age and years of
academic experience and found a significant relationship, r(337) = .84, p < .01. This strong
positive correlation suggested that analysis conducted using both age and years of experience as
independent variables would result in redundant outcomes. Furthermore, years of academic
experience was our construct of interest. Therefore, we did not use age but only used years of
academic experience in our subsequent analysis. See Table 3 for all correlational outcomes.
We conducted a correlational analysis to determine if years of academic experience were
significantly related to acceptance of evolution, knowledge of evolution, experience with
researching or teaching science, and religiosity. Our results indicate that years of experience was
significantly correlated with acceptance of evolution (MATE) r(337) = .14, p < .05. Years of
experience was also found to be significantly correlated with compatibility of faith and
evolution, r(337) = .12, p < .05. Our correlational analysis failed to detect significant

Knowledge and acceptance
relationships between years of experience and understanding of evolution (as measured by the
CINS), perceived familiarity of evolution, experience with researching or teaching science, or
levels of religiosity.
This indicates that years of academic experience is not a predictor of evolution
knowledge or religious commitment, but as years of experience increased there was an increase
in the acceptance of evolution. This was consistent with our argument that an individual's years
of academic experience is linked to the development of domain-general scientific reasoning
abilities which increases their capacity to objectively consider the plausibility of evolution.
College level biology courses. The number of college level biology courses was found to
be significantly correlated with understanding of evolution (CINS), r(337) = .16, p < .01, and
familiarity, r(337) = .41, p < .01. This indicates that as the number of biology courses increased
evolution knowledge also increased. The number of college level biology courses was also found
to be significantly correlated with experience with research or teaching science, r(337) = .21, p <
.01, which indicated that as the number of biology courses increased so did experience with
researching or teaching science. However, the number of college level courses was not found to
be significantly correlated with acceptance (MATE) or with our measure of compatibility leading
us to conclude that study in biology does not necessarily lead to increased levels of evolution
acceptance. No correlational relationship was detected between the number of college level
science courses and religiosity.
Institutional responsibility. We conducted an ANOVA using primary institutional
responsibility as the grouping factor and our two measures of evolution acceptance, two
measures of evolution knowledge, experience with researching or teaching of science, and
religiosity as dependent variables. Our analysis revealed significant differences in MATE scores,
F(4,332) = 4.20, p < .01, but no significant difference was found for evolution compatible views.
A significant difference between institutional responsibility groups was found for CINS scores,
F(4,332) = 2.53, p < .05, but no difference was detected for our perceived familiarity with
evolution item. Post hoc analysis showed that those whose primary professional responsibility
was providing service to clients or patients held significantly lower MATE scores than
participants who indicated that their primary responsibility was research (p < .01), teaching (p <
.01), or other (retired, educational assessment, etc.) (p < .01). Our post hoc analysis revealed that
those whose primary activity was service to clients or patients had significantly lower CINS
scores than participants who indicated that their primary responsibility was research (p < .05).
We did not detect any relationships between primary institutional responsibility and religiosity or
experience with research or teaching science. See Table 6 for the means and standard deviations
for the measures presented by primary institutional responsibility.

Modeling evolution acceptance
Our fourth research question stated: Do academic experience, individual characteristics,
evolution knowledge and acceptance relate to the willingness and ability to objectively consider
the plausibility and coherence of evolution-based conjectures? As discussed previously, we
hypothesized that there would be a significant interaction between knowledge of evolution,
academic and research experience, and acceptance of evolution on the ability to objectively
consider the merits of evolutionary educational psychology. We set out to determine if it was
possible to model the relationships between these variables in a manner that would be indicative
of the interplay of the measures associated with the objective consideration of the plausibility
and applicability of the proposed evolutionary educational psychology. The three latent variables
from our model are presented with the corresponding measured variables in Table 7.

The measurement model
The analysis to confirm our proposed model began with a test of our measurement model,
followed by a test of our full structural model. We tested all models using EQS 6.2 structural
equation software (Bentler, 1995), and consulted Byrne (2006) for confirmation of our outcome
interpretation.
In our measurement model we tested three factors; experience with academic research,
knowledge of evolution, and willingness and ability to engage in the consideration of the
plausibility and merits of evolution-based conjectures. To test our measurement model, we
limited most of the model measures to a single factor, with two exceptions. Both the measure of
evolution knowledge (CINS) and the measure of research engagement were linked to our
knowledge factor and willingness factor. We fixed the residuals to be uncorrelated, placed no
constraints on the loadings, and allowed the factor covariances to be freely estimated.
We used both the fit indices and the factor correlations as empirical indicators for
justification in the formation of a hypothesized model. Goodness-of-fit indices indicated a decent
to good measurement model to data fit: 2 (30, N = 337) = 62.61 p < .05, CFI = .93, GFI = .96,
AGFI = .94, Standardized RMS = .05, RMSEA = .06, and the 90% Confidence Interval of the
RMSEA between .04 and .08. See Figure 1 for correlations and measurement model structure.

our model. Further, the resulting correlations, presented in Table 8 revealed a reasonable level of
correlation between capacity to engage in the objective consideration of evolution developments
based on factors for acceptance, academic experience, and knowledge of evolution. This led us
to presume that there were acceptable levels of consistency in the measures, and no obvious
occurrences of collinearity of measurement. The correlation of r = .01 between our academic
experience and knowledge of evolution latent variables (see Table 8) indicates that these
variables are measures of different constructs that are responded to with different consistencies.
Yet, the considerably higher correlations between our experience variable and acceptance
variable (hypothesized to be a predictor of the likelihood of engaging in the consideration of
evolutionary developments) and our knowledge and acceptance variables (r = .29 and r = .34
respectively), provides justification for the use of knowledge and experience as predictors of
acceptance in our proposed model.

A proposed model
Based on the outcome of the measurement model, the content analysis of the factors, and
the literature, we maintain that the ability to objectively engage in scientific thinking is a
complex interaction of variables. Our analysis indicated a significant correlation between our
three factors; knowledge of evolution, academic experience, and capacity to objectively consider
the plausibility and merits of evolution-based developments. This provided empirical support for
our position that educational professionals' capability to objectively judge the merits of, and
evidence for, an evolutionary perspective of educational psychology is dependent on several
factors. Thus, we relied upon both theoretical and empirical support in the development of our
model.
Taking these factors into consideration, we proposed and tested the following model
representing the influence of knowledge of evolution and academic experience on the ability to
engage in the objective consideration of the plausibility and merits of evolution-based
developments (see Figure 2). We developed this model based on the notion that both domain-
general reasoning abilities and domain-specific knowledge influence the ability to engage in
unbiased examination and interpretation of evidence. In our proposed model, the objective
consideration of the plausibility of evolution-based developments is directly influenced by
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -509-
Knowledge and acceptance
knowledge of evolution (domain-specific knowledge) and academic experience (domain-general
reasoning abilities). Our model reflects the notion that the domain-specific and domain-general
variables that we measured can be used directly and indirectly to predict educational
professionals' ability to engage in the unbiased evaluation of evolution-based developments. We
posit the ability to engage in unbiased evaluation of evolution-based developments predicts the
propensity for the objective consideration of the merits of evolutionary educational psychology.

biological evolution.

The goodness-of-fit statistics indicated that the model fit the data fairly well. The results
revealed that most fit statistics were near the suggested threshold values suggested by Byrne
(2006) for an acceptable model, 2 (31, N = 337) = 62.63 p < .05, CFI = .93, GFI = .96, AGFI =
.94, Standardized RMS = .05, RMSEA = .05, and the 90% confidence interval of the RMSEA
between .03 and .07.
Levels of acceptance are critical to objective evaluation of the merits of a proposed
hypothesis (Kuhn, 1970). In our model, we represented willingness to engage in the
consideration of the merits of evolution-based conjectures as measured by evolution acceptance,
knowledge, and religiosity. We combined the influences of domain-specific knowledge of
evolution and domain-general experience with research to forecast willingness to engage in the
evaluation of evolution-based developments. Applied to our research this suggests that levels of
understanding of evolution and academic experience predicts the likelihood that an individual is
prepared to objectively evaluate the merits of evolutionary educational psychology.
The analysis of our model confirmed the direct influence of acceptance of evolution,
religiosity, knowledge of evolution, and experience with researching and teaching science, on the
willingness and capacity to engage in evaluating evolution-based developments. We also
confirmed the indirect influence of academic experience measures and additional knowledge of
evolution measures. This supports our posited relationship between measures of domain-specific
evolution knowledge, domain-general research experience, and measures of acceptance of
evolution as key indicators of the willingness and capacity to engage in unbiased evaluation of
evolutionary educational psychology research and hypotheses.
Discussion
Evolutionary educational psychology (Carlson and Levin, 2007) is a new and emerging
sub-discipline within the field of educational research. Our interest and experience researching
students' and teachers' knowledge and acceptance of evolutionary biology led us to question
whether there was a cadre of educational researchers and other post secondary education
professionals who were prepared to interpret, utilize, and evaluate the merits of this new
perspective. To our knowledge, no other study has examined levels of knowledge and acceptance
of biological evolution within a select sample of the community of educational psychologists,
educational researchers, and other education professionals who teach and mentor the next
generation of educators and educational researchers.
Our results suggest that there is an informed, sizable subgroup (recall our sample size
was well over 300 individuals) of educational professionals that exhibit preparedness to evaluate
this new view of learning and cognition. In interpreting these findings, is important to note that
our participants do not constitute a random or a representative sample of the populations of all
educational psychologists, educational research, or education professionals. Although efforts
were made to recruit as many participants as possible from the population of educational
professionals, only those who had the time and interest in participating completed our surveys.
This process of self selection for participation means we cannot generalize from this sample to
make any claims characterizing the population of all educational psychologists and other
Knowledge and acceptance
education professionals. However, it is important to note that accurately describing the
population of professional educators as a whole, while a worthwhile endeavor, was not our
objective. Rather we sought to determine if there was a sufficient base of individuals within the
educational professional community to effectively evaluate evolutionary theory's relevance to
educational psychology. This base of individuals does not have to be representative of the
members of our discipline any more than determining whether there is a cadre of biologists
prepared to conduct taxonomic analyses of certain microbial extremophiles. As with our study, it
would be reasonable to determine if there were professionals within the population of biological
scientists with the potential to accurately classify these unique organisms. Our results suggest
that there is an informed group among those in the profession who likely can evaluate
evolutionary educational psychology.
Another limitation of our study was that although we achieved a high level of reliability
with both of our instruments, they are self-report measures. Due to our desire to limit the scope
of the surveys, minimize the time required to complete them, and maximize the completion rate,
we chose not to collect qualitative data that may have provided additional insight into the
perspectives held by the participants. This is an excellent direction for future research.
An additional instrument related limitation of our study is the reliance on the CINS
(Anderson et al., 2002) as a measure of general knowledge of evolution. We recognize the CINS
is constrained to assessing knowledge of natural selection, albeit from a broad perspective.
However, given the limitation of extent instruments to assess comprehensive knowledge of
evolution, and the centrality of natural selection to broader themes in evolution, we chose the
CINS for its clear utility for examining our research questions. The development of an
instrument that assesses comprehensive evolution knowledge is an excellent focus for future
research.
Our findings indicate that the relationships among understanding and acceptance of
biological evolution and experience with research and scientific reasoning may impact the ability
of educational professionals to objectively evaluate the merits and evidence supporting
educational evolutionary psychology (Hogan and Maglienti, 2001; Kuhn and Pearsall, 2000).
Although our participants' range of knowledge of evolution, acceptance of evolution and
measures of religiosity were found to be consistent with previous research, (Anderson, et al.,
2002; Gallup, 2008; Rutledge and Warden, 2000) our sample was revealed to have higher levels
of knowledge of evolution (specifically the process of natural selection) than expected, higher
levels of acceptance of evolution than expected, and greater compatibility of religion and
evolution than found in previous studies. This is likely due to the self-selected nature of our
sample of participants, and this finding cannot be generalized to educational professional as a
whole.
Our analyses revealed that several variables including years of academic experience,
principal academic responsibility, level of education, number of college level biology courses,
experience with researching and teaching science, and degree of religiosity, were significantly
associated with the acceptance and/or the understanding of evolution. It is important to note the
results revealed no correlation between the number of courses and acceptance of evolution. This
suggests that knowledge of evolution requires exposure to domain-specific content, but
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 7(4). 2009. -512-
Knowledge and acceptance
acceptance may come from domain-general understanding of theories and scientific knowledge.
This lends support to our argument that the combination of domain-specific and domain-general
measures are essential for determining capacity to objectively consider evidence for an
evolutionary educational psychology perspective.
As new developments and evidence emerge in evolutionary educational psychology, it is
essential that future generations of educational professionals are prepared to evaluate the merits
of new findings. Our data indicates that there are individuals within the profession who may be
positioned to respond to this need. Our results also revealed that participants with M.A.s and
M.Ed.s had constrained knowledge of evolution, experience in scientific research, and
subsequent levels of evolution acceptance. If these participants are the next generation of
scholars, there is a necessity to address their preparedness. These needs may be attended to by
including aspects of evolutionary educational psychology into the professional education
curriculum and by extending opportunities for gaining experience with scientific research. This
is critical to assure that in the future there is a cadre of educational professionals who are
prepared to continue to evaluate the plausibility and applicability of evolutionary educational
psychology or other developments without bias.
We recommend that those individuals with the background and interest in this emerging
field examine evolutionary educational psychology to determine its possible relevance and utility
for their research programs and potential applications to other fields of study. Further, we
encourage scholars who employ the evolutionary educational psychology framework to seek
investigation methods that are capable of empirically testing learning and cognition based on this
perspective. For example, research that explores the relative ease of learning in biologically
primary versus biological secondary domains from an evolutionary educational psychology
perspective would be useful to examine this speculated distinction and more fully appreciate the
learning implications of the domain differences. In addition, we encourage educators who teach
theory courses to include elements of evolution-based explanations for cognition in their
curricula so that future scholars can develop awareness of this perspective and be prepared to
consider the utility of evolutionary educational psychology in their research programs.
