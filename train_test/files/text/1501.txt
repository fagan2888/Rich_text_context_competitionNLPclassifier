Public Health Impact of Antiviral Therapy for
Hepatitis C in the United States
Michael L. Volk, Rachel Tocco, Sameer Saini, and Anna S.F. Lok
Despite dramatic improvements in antiviral therapy for hepatitis C, there is reason to believe
that the uptake of antiviral therapy remains limited. The aims of this study were to determine
the number of patients being treated with antiviral therapy in the U.S., to estimate the public
health impact of these treatment patterns, and to identify barriers to treatment for patients
with hepatitis C. Data on the number of new patient pegylated interferon prescriptions each
year, from 2002-2007, was obtained from Wolters Kluwer Inc., which maintains an elec-
tronic audit of pharmacies nationwide. A Markov model was created of the population with
chronic hepatitis C in the U.S. from 2002 to 2030, and was used to estimate the number of
liver-related deaths caused by hepatitis C that will be prevented by current treatment pat-
terns. The National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) Hepatitis C Fol-
low-Up Questionnaire was used to investigate reasons for lack of treatment and to identify
strategies for improving access. Approximately 663,000 patients received antiviral therapy
between 2002 and 2007, and treatment rates appear to be declining. If this trend continues,
only 14.5% of liver-related deaths caused by hepatitis C from 2002-2030 will be prevented
by antiviral therapy. Results from the NHANES questionnaire suggest that the primary
barrier to treatment is lack of diagnosis, with 69/133 (adjusted proportion 49%) of respon-
dents previously unaware that they had hepatitis C. Conclusion: Efforts to improve rates of
diagnosis and treatment will be required if the future public health burden of hepatitis C is
to be ameliorated. (HEPATOLOGY 2009;50:1750-1755.)
Hepatitis C is a major public health burden in the
United States. It causes nearly 8,000 deaths per
year,1 is the leading cause for liver transplanta-
tion,2 and has contributed to a rise in the incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma.3 Quality of life is impaired for
patients infected with the virus, even among those with-
out cirrhosis.4 As of 2001, there were an estimated 3.2
million people in the U.S. with chronic hepatitis C. Al-
though the incidence of new infections has declined, the
number of deaths may continue to increase 2- to 4-fold
over the next 20 years due to prevalent cases with long-
standing infection.5,6
The future public health burden of hepatitis C could
potentially be mitigated by antiviral therapy.5 In the last
two decades there have been dramatic improvements in
treatment for hepatitis C. The benefit of adding ribavirin
to interferon was demonstrated in a series of studies in the
late 1990s,7 and then pegylated interferon was approved
at the end of 2001. Combination therapy with pegylated
interferon and ribavirin can now achieve sustained viro-
logical response (SVR) in 50% of patients,8 compared to
rates of 17% with standard interferon alone.7 Patients
who achieve SVR enjoy long-term remission of disease,
with liver-related mortality rates comparable to the gen-
eral population.9-11
Despite these improvements, there are reasons to be-
lieve that the uptake of antiviral therapy may be limited.
Patients with hepatitis C are more likely to lack health
insurance and a usual source of care.12,13 Studies have
demonstrated that primary care physicians lack knowl-
edge about risk factors and testing for hepatitis C.14,15
Access to a specialist willing to prescribe antiviral therapy
may be another limiting factor.16 Finally, many patients

have contraindications to treatment, or do not wish to
suffer the myriad side effects.17 For these reasons, we hy-
pothesized that the public health impact of antiviral ther-
apy may be limited, as much by low utilization as by the
inherent limitations in the available medications. Several
studies from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and
Health Maintenance Organizations have reported low
treatment rates among patients identified to have hepati-
tis C.18,19 However, no national data exist on the number
of patients currently receiving antiviral therapy in the
U.S., or the impact of current practice patterns on the
burden of hepatitis C. The aims of this study were to
determine the public health impact of current antiviral
therapy and to identify barriers to treatment of hepatitis
C.
Materials and Methods
Number of Patients Treated for Hepatitis C
To determine the number of patients receiving antivi-
ral therapy in the U.S., data were obtained from Wolters
Kluwer on the number of new patient prescriptions for
pegylated interferon products (peg-interferon -2a and
peg-interferon -2b) each year from 2002-2007. Wolters
Kluwer maintains a longitudinal nationwide sample of
patients filling prescriptions at retail, mail-order, and spe-
cialty pharmacies.20 This sample captures 31% of paid
prescriptions nationwide. Every patient is given an en-
crypted unique identifier in order to differentiate between
new prescriptions and refills. Prescription data from this
sample are then linked to a second database that measures
total monthly prescription volume in the U.S. from a
random sample of pharmacies with computer manage-
ment systems. This database represents 80% of U.S. retail
prescriptions. In this fashion, the number of prescriptions
from the longitudinal patient sample is projected to de-
termine the total number of prescriptions per year for a
given product. Demographics of subjects in the Wolters
Kluwer longitudinal sample (Source Lx) compare simi-
larly to those from the U.S. census, as shown in Appendix
A.
Impact of Antiviral Therapy on Burden of Disease
Markov Model Structure. In order to estimate the
impact of current practice patterns on the future burden
of hepatitis C, we created a dynamic population Markov
model of patients with chronic hepatitis C in the U.S.
from 2002-2030. During this time the population could
change in size due to new infections, or due to patients
being removed from the cohort because of death from
liver disease or other causes, as shown in Fig. 1. The pri-
mary endpoint of the model was the number of liver-
related deaths projected to be prevented by antiviral
therapy during this period.
Input Data and Model Assumptions. All variables
included in the model are shown in Table 1. Baseline
prevalence was obtained from the National Health and
Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES),21 and annual
incidence of new infections was obtained from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control.22 The proportion of acute cases
progressing to chronic hepatitis C was estimated from the
proportion of cases in NHANES with positive antibody
but negative RNA.21 The number of patients receiving
antiviral therapy between 2002 and 2007 was obtained
from national pharmacy data (Wolters Kluwer database,
as described above). The number of patients receiving
antiviral therapy each year after 2007 was projected by
fitting a three-parameter inverse linear equation to the
2002-2007 data, with optimization performed according
to the least-squares criterion.23 Liver-related mortality
rate without treatment was based on current mortality
attributable to hepatitis C,1 and was assumed to increase
by 10% of the baseline rate each year5,6 to account for the
increasing average duration of infection. Nonliver mor-
tality rate was based on life tables from the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics,24 and was assumed to increase by
10% of the baseline rate each year to account for aging of
the hepatitis C population. The SVR rate was set at 50%
in the base-case analysis,8 with a 10-fold reduction in
liver-related mortality risk among those achieving
SVR.9-11 Calculations were performed using Excel (Mi-
crosoft, Redmond, WA). The model cycle length was 1
year, and no discounting was performed.
Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis was per-
formed on all variables. This was done both to determine
susceptibility of the base-case estimate to uncertainty sur-

infected with hepatitis C in the United States.

rounding the variables, as well as to estimate how many
extra lives could be saved by improvements in various
aspects of medical care. For example, future advances in
antiviral therapy may improve rates of SVR, or public
education campaigns could increase the number of cases
detected. Finally, because current guidelines recommend
selecting patients for treatment in part based on their risk
of future complications,25 in sensitivity analysis the
treated patients were assumed to have a 100% higher risk
of liver-related death than those untreated.
Reasons for Lack of Treatment
Treatment decisions were investigated using data from
the NHANES Hepatitis C Follow-Up Questionnaire.
Every 2 years, NHANES selects a random sample of the
U.S. population to participate in a health examination
and laboratory testing. Beginning with the 2001/2002
version, participants testing positive for hepatitis C were
sent a letter informing them of their test results. Four
months later, they received a follow-up telephone ques-
tionnaire. In all, 277 subjects were contacted during the
three iterations of this survey, the response rate was 136
(49%), and there were three partial completions, yielding
a sample size of 133 completed questionnaires.
The NHANES questionnaire, which can be seen at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/
pf_hcq_03_08.pdf, contains a series of questions about
testing, follow-up, doctor's recommendations, and sub-
ject decision-making about treatment for hepatitis C. Re-
sponses to these questions were used to place subjects into
the following categories with regard to treatment: (1) un-
aware of the diagnosis, (2) aware of the diagnosis, but did
not seek further medical attention, (3) doctor did not
recommend treatment, (4) subject refused treatment, and
(5) treated. This classification was performed indepen-
dently by two authors (M.V., R.T.), and agreement was
100%. Subjects who were previously unaware of their
diagnosis and sought medical attention during the 4
months between notification of their diagnosis and re-
ceipt of the questionnaire were classified as "unaware."
Sample weights were used to adjust for oversampling of
African-Americans, Hispanics, and subjects age 65 in
the NHANES study.26 Chi-square analysis was then used
to determine bivariate associations between these catego-
ries and variables such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
insurance status. Calculations were performed using Stata
10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Number of Patients Treated for Hepatitis C. Re-
sults from the Wolters Kluwer prescription audit are
shown in Table 2. There were 126,000 new retail pre-
scriptions for pegylated interferon products in the year
2002, and this number had decreased to 83,000 pre-
scriptions per year by 2007. The fitted line projecting
future treatment rates is shown in Fig. 2. If this trend were
to continue, fewer than 1.4 million patients would be
treated cumulatively by 2030.
Impact of Antiviral Therapy on Burden of Disease.
In the base-case analysis, without treatment the popula-
tion with chronic hepatitis C would be expected to de-
crease slowly to 2.95 million by 2030, as shown in Fig.
3. With treatment, assuming current practice patterns
continue, the population with chronic hepatitis C is ex-
pected to decrease to 2.37 million by 2030. There would
be 259,000 liver-related deaths caused by hepatitis C be-
tween 2002 and 2030 without treatment, and current
antiviral therapy would prevent 37,500 of these. Thus,
the current state of antiviral therapy is projected to pre-

vent only 14.5% of liver-related deaths caused by hepati-
tis C between 2002 and 2030.
These estimates were most sensitive to the number of
patients treated and the selection of patients for treatment
who are at higher risk for disease progression. The most
influential variables are shown in Table 3; none of the
other variables affected the results by more than 1%. If the
discovery of new medications in the future increases rates
of SVR to 75%, at current rates of treatment this would
still only prevent 21.7% of liver-related deaths caused by
hepatitis C. Only by increasing treatment rates by 75%
and increasing SVR rates to 75% could more than half of
the liver-related deaths be prevented.
Reasons for Lack of Treatment. Results from the
NHANES questionnaire indicate that the primary reason
for lack of treatment is lack of diagnosis, as shown in Fig.
4. Of the 133 respondents, 69 (proportion adjusting for
sample weights 49%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 39%-
60%) were previously unaware of their diagnosis, 12 (ad-
justed proportion 9%, 95% CI 3%-16%) did not follow
up with a doctor about their hepatitis C, 33 (adjusted
proportion 24%, 95% CI 15%-33%) were recommended
by their doctor not to be treated, 8 (adjusted proportion
6%, 95% CI 1%-10%) refused treatment, and 11 (ad-
justed proportion 12%, 95% CI 4%-19%) were treated.
This suggests that the largest barrier to treatment is failure
to diagnose infection with hepatitis C. Physician recom-
mendation appears to be the second most common reason
why patients are not treated. Although the questionnaire
does not provide sufficient medical detail to judge the
appropriateness of these recommendations, it is concern-
ing that 28% of the 100 subjects who had seen a doctor by
the time of the survey had the understanding that no
further follow-up for their hepatitis C was necessary.
Reasons for lack of treatment did not differ substan-
tially by race or ethnicity. Males were slightly more likely
to be unaware of their diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 2.2,
95% CI 1.06-4.5), but less likely to have their doctor
recommend treatment (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.80).
Despite this, the rates of treatment were identical between
males and females. Not surprisingly, limited access to
medical care appears to be a major barrier to diagnosis and
treatment of hepatitis C. Respondents who lacked health
insurance were more likely to be unaware of their diagno-
sis (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8-12.7) and less likely to be treated
(OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.03-2.6). Additionally, respondents
lacking a usual source of care were more likely to be un-
aware of their diagnosis (OR 19.0, 95% CI 2.4-148.1)
and no respondents lacking a usual source of care had
received treatment.
Discussion
In this study we estimated the number of patients cur-
rently receiving antiviral therapy for hepatitis C in the
U.S., identified reasons for lack of treatment, and pro-

jected the impact current therapy will have on preventing
liver-related deaths over the next two decades. We found
that relatively few patients have been treated with pegy-
lated interferon, and treatment rates appear to be declin-
ing. These findings are similar to a recent report from
Europe, in which treatment rates varied by country from
1% to 16% of hepatitis C patients ever treated.27 If this
trend continues, antiviral therapy may prevent fewer than
15% of liver-related deaths caused by hepatitis C in the
U.S. between 2002 and 2030.
Fortunately, new treatments for hepatitis C are antici-
pated to become available in the next several years, which
should increase rates of SVR among patients receiving
treatment.28 However, treatment first requires a diagno-
sis, and in this study we found that approximately half of
all people with hepatitis C in the U.S. are unaware of their
diagnosis. There are several possible reasons for this situ-
ation. First, lack of health insurance poses an obvious
barrier to testing. In 2001, 30% of patients with hepatitis
C were uninsured,12 and this number has likely increased
since that time. Second, because hepatitis C is usually
asymptomatic, patients without any other medical prob-
lems may not seek medical attention. In the NHANES
survey, we found that respondents lacking a usual source
of medical care were 19 times more likely to be unaware of
their diagnosis. This is unfortunate, because those pa-
tients without comorbidities may be the best candidates
for antiviral therapy. Finally, identification of risk factors
and testing for hepatitis C may be a low priority during a
busy primary care appointment. It has been estimated
that provision of all recommended preventative care
would consume 7.4 hours of each primary doctor's day,
leaving no time for other tasks.29 Because the U.S. Pre-
ventative Services Task Force has concluded that insuffi-
cient evidence exists to recommend screening for hepatitis
C, physicians may consider this a low priority.30 Further-
more, physicians may not realize the value of diagnosing
hepatitis C, because prior studies have identified limited
knowledge about the disease among primary care physi-
cians.14 Thus, increasing the number of patients diag-
nosed will require education of the public and physicians
alike, as well as attention to the worsening problem of the
uninsured in the U.S.
Even if all patients with hepatitis C were aware of their
diagnosis, a number of barriers to treatment would still
remain. First, many patients will be ineligible for cur-
rently available antiviral therapy due to decompensated
cirrhosis, comorbidities, or other reasons. Second, some
patients may not follow up for further care, and others
may not be referred to a specialist who prescribes antiviral
therapy. In our study we could not differentiate between
lack of referral by the primary physician versus lack of
treatment by the specialist, but prior studies have sug-
gested that lack of referral is a major barrier. In one survey
of primary care physicians, 72% would not refer a patient
with normal liver enzymes for treatment,14 despite evi-
dence that such patients can develop progressive disease.31
Additionally, patients in some areas may have limited
access to specialists who treat hepatitis C, because 20% of
all gastroenterologists prescribe 80% of antiviral therapy
in this country.16 As mentioned above, it is possible that
future improvements in antiviral therapy will increase en-
thusiasm for treatment among the medical community,
and thus increase the number of patients treated. How-
ever, very little is known about health services delivery and
quality of care for hepatitis C, and further research in this
area is needed.
Although this study is the first to examine the public
health impact of antiviral therapy for hepatitis C, it does
have several important limitations. First, the Wolters Klu-
wer sample includes only commercial pharmacies, and
does not include Veteran's Affairs pharmacies or patients
treated in clinical trials. Therefore, it is possible that the
true number of patients treated for hepatitis C each year
in the U.S. is being underestimated. Conversely,
NHANES estimates were used for the prevalence of hep-

atitis C, which may themselves be an underestimate due
to the exclusion of homeless and institutionalized individ-
uals. Thus, because potential errors in the numerator and
denominator lie in the same direction, estimates of the
proportion treated may be reasonably correct. A second
important limitation is that the NHANES questionnaire
does not provide sufficient detail to thoroughly examine
patient and physician decision-making about testing and
treatment for hepatitis C. Finally, any attempt to predict
the future is likely to be imprecise. Therefore, projections
regarding future treatment rates and liver-related deaths
are only intended to provide a rough overview of the
public health impact of antiviral therapy. The strength of
this study is that it provides the first look at nationwide
practice patterns for treatment of hepatitis C.
In conclusion, despite tremendous advances in antivi-
ral therapy, current antiviral therapy is projected to pre-
vent fewer than 15% of liver-related deaths caused by
hepatitis C between 2002 and 2030. One of the key find-
ings of this study is that the future development of new
and better medications will have a less than optimal im-
pact on this problem unless more patients are diagnosed
and referred for treatment. Increased public health efforts
are needed to improve access to antiviral therapy for pa-
tients with hepatitis C.
