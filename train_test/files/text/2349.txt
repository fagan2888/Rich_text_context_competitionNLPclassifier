women: findings from the national longitudinal
study of adolescent health

Abstract
Background: There exists a dearth of prospective adolescent eating disorder studies with samples that are large
enough to detect small or medium sized effects for risk factors, that are generalizable to the broader population,
and that follow adolescents long enough to fully capture the period of development when the risk of eating
disorder symptoms occurring is highest. As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine psychosocial risk
factors for purging for weight control in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. Data were extracted
from the restricted-use data sets of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves I-III), selecting
females with valid demographic and purging information (N = 5,670).
Results: The prevalence of purging was 0.88% at Wave II and 0.56% at Wave III. In multivariable multinomial logistic
regressions, purging at Wave II was predicted by parental poverty and low levels of self-esteem at Wave I; purging
at Wave III was predicted by body mass index and the frequency of delinquent behaviors at Wave I.
Conclusions: Individuals with high body mass index, individuals with low self-esteem, and individuals in families
experiencing economic hardship appear specifically at risk for the development of purging behaviors in later years
and may benefit from more targeted prevention efforts.

Background
The etiologies of eating disorders and their core symp-
toms are best characterized by multifactorial models
involving biological, psychological, interpersonal, and
cultural variables [1]. Experts have also noted, however,
that the research is limited by the dearth of prospective
studies with samples large enough to detect small or
medium sized effects, the inclusion of demographically
limited samples, and the lack of follow-up periods that
are long enough to fully capture the period of develop-
ment when the risk of the onset of eating disorder symp-
toms is highest [1,2].
The present study focused on purging (vomiting or
abusing laxatives) to lose weight or keep from gaining
weight as a clinically relevant symptom and as a possible
proxy for the presence of an eating disorder. Purging
behaviors have received increasing scientific attention
not only in the context of a full syndrome eating dis-
order but also as symptoms of clinical relevance in their
own right [3-5]. Only a few studies have explored risk
factors for purging using longitudinal designs, and most
of these studies have focused on just one risk factor. For
example, two studies of adolescent girls found that eat-
ing dinner [6] or eating meals with their families [7] was
associated with a decreased risk for onset of purging or
extreme weight control behaviors.
Due to skip patterns used in most epidemiological
studies of adults, information about purging behaviors
typically was collected only in individuals who scored
positively on the core symptom of anorexia nervosa (re-
fusal to maintain a minimum adequate body weight) or
bulimia nervosa (recurrent episodes of purging and
binge eating) [8]. In contrast, studies of adolescents typ-
ically have measured disordered eating symptoms among
all participants, thus affording the opportunity to ex-
plore correlates of these behaviors. Results show marked

gender differences in the incidence and prevalence of
purging [9]. For example, in a community sample of
over 13,000 boys and girls (ages 9 to 14 years), one-year
incidence of purging was 1.3% in girls and 0.3% in boys
[6]. In a school-based sample of over 2,500 boys and
girls, "extreme weight control behaviors" (which in-
cluded purging) were also reported to be more common
in girls than boys [10]. The present study capitalized
upon the availability of data collected as part of the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), which affords the unique opportunity to exam-
ine the prevalence and incidence of, as well as risk fac-
tors for, purging in a nationally representative sample of
United States' (US) youth. Because of the low base rate
of males who purged in our sample (only 0.55% of young
men reported purging at any wave of study whereas
1.96% of young women reported purging), we excluded
male participants from our sample.
Our approach to and selection of potential risk factors
was informed by Kraemer and colleagues' conceptual
framework and by a corresponding review paper of the
empirical studies of risk factors for eating disorders
[2,11]. Specifically, to test whether a variable confers risk
(rather than merely representing a correlate), data are
needed that were either collected prior to occurrence of
the behavior or are of a nature where one may reason-
ably infer that, even when collected after occurrence, the
data are not contaminated by the outcome in question
(e.g., gender, race/ethnicity). Therefore, in our study, we
defined occurrence, or "incidence cases", as participants
who reported purging at a subsequent wave of study,
controlling for purging behaviors at Wave I. Given our
interest in identifying adolescent risk factors for purging,
we limited our sample to adolescent girls who, at study
entry (Wave I), were age 18 or younger.
Our study included a considerable range of potential
adolescent risk factors including demographic variables,
early onset menarche, body image concerns, adverse
childhood experiences, coping, and health or mental
health problems [2]. We hypothesized that, after control-
ling for age, race, parental education, and purging at
Wave I, higher scores on each of these risk factor con-
structs (and, in the case of self-esteem, lower scores)
would confer greater risk for the occurrence of purging
behaviors in young adult women.
Methods
Participants
The sample comprised 5,670 female participants whose
data were extracted from the restricted-use Add Health
survey Waves I (1994­1995), II (1996), and III (2001­
2002). Add Health has been following over 20,000
American adolescents starting in grades 7­12 over the
course of fourteen years, with four waves of data collection
throughout this time period (Wave IV did not collect data
about purging and, therefore, was not used for the present
study). The initial sample was established by sampling
students from 132 schools in the United States. Due to
oversampling of some population subgroups, Add Health
investigators developed sampling weights to be used in
statistical analyses so findings can be generalized to be rep-
resentative for region, urbanicity, and ethnicity. Further de-
tails about the Add Health study design can be found
elsewhere [12,13].
Inclusion criteria for the present study were those par-
ticipants who were reported as female at all three waves
(in a few instances, gender information was not consistent
across study waves), had valid age information, were age
18 or younger at Wave I, reported responses to purging
behaviors at Wave I, and had valid data required for apply-
ing sampling weights (see Data Analysis section). Of the
total 10,480 girls included in Add Health at Wave I, 5,670
met the inclusion criteria required for our analyses (54%
Wave I sample, 75% of Wave II sample, and 71% of Wave
III sample). Most of the girls that we excluded did not
have information needed for applying sample weights at
all waves. However, because we used the sample weights
developed by Add Health in our statistical models to ac-
count for attrition and oversampling, our findings are rep-
resentative of young women in the United States.
The mean age at study entry was 15.15 (SD = 1.57);
about one-third (30.97%) of the weighted sample was
non-White. Highest parental education was reported by
participants' parents or guardians as follows: less than
high school, 11.65%; high school diploma or equivalent,
32.10%; some college, 22.38%; and college degree or
more, 33.87%. All results reflect adjustment for sampling
strategy [13,14].
Instruments and procedures
The Add Health survey measures a wide range of psy-
chological and physical health issues and behaviors, a
subset of which was used in this study. Some constructs
(e.g., depressive symptoms) were measured using un-
equal numbers of items across waves; in such cases, we
followed the practice of prior investigators of using only
those items that were administered in all three waves,
and we calculated Cronbach's alpha based on the un-
weighted sample included in the present study.
Because, by definition, exposure to a risk factor must
occur prior to occurrence of the dependent variable of
interest, predictor variables collected at Wave I were
used to investigate purging at Wave II and Wave III.
Attention-deficit hyperactivity symptoms and childhood
abuse were the only predictor variables used in this
study that were collected at Wave III, as they were mea-
sured retrospectively at Wave III with a focus on experi-
encing them in early childhood.

Demographic information
Following work by Brown and colleagues, [15] partici-
pants' self-reported race/ethnicity was coded into a
binary variable representing White vs. non-White, and
highest parental education achieved by either parent or
adult guardian was coded as an ordinal variable repre-
senting less than high school, high school or equivalent,
some college, and college graduate or postgraduate edu-
cation. Age was recorded as age at last birthday. (Age at
Wave I needed to be calculated because only birth year
and birth month were available in Wave I. To calculate
age, information given on birth date was subtracted
from date of interview).
Body image and eating behaviors
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing
weight (in pounds) by the product of height (in inches)
squared times the value 703 [16]. Weight perception was
measured using a single item "How do you think of
yourself in terms of weight?" with response choices ran-
ging from "1 = very underweight" to "5 = very overweight".
Purging status was determined based on participants' re-
sponses to the question of whether, in the past 7 days, the
participant had been trying to lose or maintain weight. If
the respondent answered yes, Add Health asked a series
of follow up questions to determine what method the in-
dividuals were using to lose or maintain weight. Partici-
pants could select multiple options that were provided,
including diet, exercise, vomiting, diet pill use, laxative
use, or other. Those who reported that they had, in the
last 7 days, tried to lose or maintain weight through the
use of vomiting and/or laxative misuse were coded as pur-
ging. Questions did not address frequency of occurrence.
Diet pill use in the absence of purging was coded as
present if respondents reported use of diet pills but denied
vomiting or laxative use.
Classification of participants as current purgers
A three-level polyotomous variable was created to clas-
sify current purging. The first group was comprised of
participants who did not report purging at either Wave
II or Wave III. The second group was comprised of
those reported purging at Wave II. Finally, all individuals
who did not report purging at Wave II but did report
purging at Wave III were coded into the third group. A
small number of individuals reported purging at both
Waves II and III (0.04% of the weighted sample), and
were placed into the Wave II group.
Reproductive health related variables
Early onset menarche was coded as present in girls
reporting having their first menstrual period before age
11 years [17]. Pregnancy was coded as present if the re-
spondent reported having been pregnant, including any
pregnancy that ended in abortion, stillbirth, miscarriage,
or live birth after which the baby died.
Self-esteem
Four questions based on Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale
[18] were used to measure self-esteem, including "You
have many good qualities", "You have much to be proud
of", "You like yourself just the way you are", and "You
feel you are doing things just right". Participants rated
each item on a scale from 1 to 5, and, consistent with
Kort-Butler et al., [19] a total score was calculated by
adding across the items, where higher numbers indicate
higher self-esteem. (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80).
Active coping
Four questions were used to measure active coping, in-
cluding "When you have a problem to solve, the first
thing you do is get as many facts about the problem as
possible", "When you are attempting to find a solution
to a problem, you usually try to think of as many differ-
ent ways to approach the problem as possible", "When
making decisions, you generally use systematic methods
for judging and comparing alternatives", and "After carry-
ing out a solution to a problem, you usually try to analyze
what went right and what went wrong". Each item was
rated on a scale from 1 to 5; a total score was created by
summing across the items, and higher scores reflected
more active coping. [15] (Cronbach's alpha = 0.75).
Mental health related variables
Depressive symptoms were measured using a modified ver-
sion of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression
(CES-D) scale [20]. Participants rated symptom frequency
in the past week on a scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3
(most of the time). In the present study we used the
nine items that were asked at all three waves, and cre-
ated a total score for Wave I. [21] (Cronbach's alpha =
0.81). In addition, participants were asked, "During the
last 12 months, how many times did you actually at-
tempt suicide?" A binary variable (attempted suicide)
was created contrasting those who had not attempted
suicide during the past 12 months with those who had
attempted suicide one or more times. Participants were
asked (no/yes) whether, in the past 12 months, they had
"received psychological or emotional counseling" (psy-
chological counseling). Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD) was measured in Wave III. Partici-
pants were asked to "Think back to when you were be-
tween 5 and 12 years of age. For each of the following
statements, which answer best describes your behavior
when you were that age?" A list of all but one of the symp-
toms for ADHD as described in the 4th edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV) [22] was then presented, and participants rated

how frequently the symptoms were experienced ("never
or rarely", "sometimes", "often", or "very often"). The
impulsivity symptom "often interrupts or intrudes on
others" was not measured in Add Health. Consistent with
McClernon and colleagues, [23] each symptom was coded
as present if the frequency rating was "often" or "very
often". Two severity subscales were created by summing
the nine binary inattention symptoms (ADHD-IN; Cron-
bach's alpha = 0. 80) and the eight binary hyperactivity-
impulsivity items (ADHD-HI; Cronbach's alpha = 0.72).
Delinquency
Seven questions measuring delinquent behavior were
available at each wave. Specifically, participants were
asked "In the past 12 months, how often did you: (1) dam-
age property that didn't belong to you; (2) steal something
worth more than $50; (3) go into a house or building to
steal something; (4) use or threaten to use a weapon to get
something from someone; (5) sell marijuana or other
drugs; (6) steal something worth less than $50; (7) take
part in a fight where a group of your friends was against
another group". Consistent with previous studies, re-
sponses to each individual question were dichotomized by
recoding the original 4-point Likert format (never, one or
two times, three or four times, five times or more) into
never versus  1. The recoded items were then summed,
generating a Delinquency Scale total score with a range
from 0 to 7. [24] The reliability of this scale was modest
(Cronbach's alpha = 0.61).
Childhood adversity
Family poverty was measured using a parent's responses
to three questions (no = 0, yes = 1): receiving public as-
sistance, aid to families with dependent children, or food
stamps; responses were summed for a total family poverty
score with higher scores indicating greater economic
hardship (Cronbach's alpha = 0.86). Binary variables were
created indicating whether the participant had experi-
enced these events for at least one parent: never lived with
parent and parental death. In Wave III, participants were
asked to retrospectively report (no/yes) whether, before
the 6th grade, they had experienced childhood abuse
(from parents or other adult caretakers): "not taking care
of your basic needs, such as keeping you clean or provid-
ing food and clothing?" (childhood neglect) or "slapped,
hit or kicked you?" (childhood physical abuse).
Data analysis
All data analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 [24].
As part of Add Health's survey design, certain demo-
graphic subgroups were sampled with unequal probability.
In order to generate nationally representative estimates,
therefore, Add Health investigators developed a weighting
system which includes a stratum variable to adjust for
geographic stratification, a cluster variable to adjust for
the primary sampling unit (PSU; i.e. the school identifier),
and a weight variable (using Wave III weights) to adjust
for the oversampling of certain demographic characteris-
tics within each PSU [13,25]. All analyses and estimates
were performed using the weighted sample.
For each hypothesized risk or protective factor, multi-
nomial logistic regression analysis was conducted, adjust-
ing for the potentially confounding effects of age, race,
parental education, and purging at Wave I. In the next
step, a multivariable multinomial regression model was
tested including only those risk or protective factors that
had been shown to significantly differ (p < 0.05) between
any two groups within the univariable comparisons.
Results
Prevalence and incidence of purging across the three
waves
Unweighted frequencies and weighted proportions for
purging are provided in Table 1. Regarding the weighted
sample, the prevalence of purging was 0.40% at Wave I.
The prevalence of current purging, as it was defined
above, was 0.88% at Wave II and 0.56% at Wave III.
Risk factors for the development of current purging
As shown in Table 2, among the variables pertaining to
body image and eating behavior, overweight self-perception
was found to be significantly associated with purging at
Wave II: a significantly higher percentage of young women
with purging at Wave II reported that they felt overweight
at Wave I compared to those who were not purging at
Wave II. Purgers at Waves II and III had significantly
higher BMI at Wave I. However, BMI at Wave I did not
predict differences in the likelihood of purging between
Waves II and III. Using diet pills as weight control was not

associated with purging at Waves II or III, nor was early-
onset menarche or teenage pregnancy.
Several significant effects were found in the mental
health domain. Those who purged at Wave II had lower
levels of self-esteem at Wave I; interestingly, those who
purged at Wave III had higher levels of self-esteem at
Wave I than those who purged at Wave II, but self-
esteem was not associated with purging at Wave III.
Higher scores on the depressive symptom scale at Wave
I were significantly associated with purging at Wave II
as well as purging at Wave III. Those who purged at
Wave II were more likely to have attempted suicide, re-
ceived psychological counseling, or engaged in delin-
quent behaviors at Wave I. Regarding the measures of
ADHD symptoms, no significant associations were found
for the inattentiveness scale; however, participants who
purged at Wave II high higher levels of hyperactivity/im-
pulsiveness at Wave I than those who did not. Finally, no
significant relationships were found regarding the active
coping scale variable.
Of the measures of childhood adversity, having never
lived with one (or both) parent (s) and parental poverty
were associated with an increased likelihood of purging
at Wave II. Not eating with parents, losing a parent to
death, childhood neglect, and childhood physical abuse
were not significantly associated with purging.
Table 3 shows the multivariable multinomial regres-
sion model that included only variables that had a sig-
nificant relationship with purging at Wave II and/or
Wave III. In this model, suicide attempts, body image,
depression symptoms, hyperactivity, having psycho-
logical counseling, and never having lived with one or
both parents were not significantly associated with pur-
ging at either wave.
However, parental poverty and self-esteem were asso-
ciated with an increased likelihood of purging at Wave
II. Specifically, those who purged at Wave II had higher
levels of parental poverty and lower self-esteem. BMI
was not significantly associated with purging at Wave II,
but those who purged at Wave III had significantly
higher BMI levels at Wave I.
Contrary to what we had hypothesized, it was found
that those who purged at Wave III had significantly
lower rates of delinquent behavior at Wave I. Addition-
ally, those who purged at Wave III had lower rates of de-
linquency than those who purged at Wave II.
Discussion
The overall aim of this study was to examine a broad
range of potential adolescent risk factors for developing
purging behaviors in a nationally representative sample of
U.S. young adult women. Demographic variables did not
differentiate risk for the development of purging behav-
iors. In univariable analyses, several childhood variables
were identified to increase risk for purging. Higher BMI,
suicide attempts, overweight self-perception, parental pov-
erty, depression symptoms, hyperactivity-impulsivity, de-
linquent behaviors, low self-esteem, and never having
lived with one (or both) parent (s) were associated with
purging at Wave II. Higher BMI and depressive symptoms
were associated with purging at Wave III. Finally, lower
levels of self-esteem were associated with an increased
likelihood of purging at Wave II compared to Wave III.
Of the demographic variables controlled for in our
study, purging at Wave I was the only variable that was
associated with purging at either follow-up time point.
Neither participants' age, race/ethnicity, nor highest level
of parental education was found to be associated with

across the two groups is not particularly surprising given
the fact that the Add Health sample has a restricted age
range. Consistent with a growing literature that reports
that girls or women from various racial/ethnicity back-
grounds are equally likely to develop disordered eating,
[26,27] our results suggest that purging may be a prob-
lem across various racial or ethnic groups. Our finding
that highest level of parental education, an indicator
often used in the literature as a proxy for parental socio-
economic status, did not differ when comparing purging
groups warrants comment in light of our result that
family poverty did differentiate the two groups. Both var-
iables were measured using parent/guardian self-report.
While parental education does not appear to increase risk
for purging, experiencing economic hardship may elevate
such risk as will be discussed in more detail below.
Regarding the purging variable, it was found that those
who reported purging at Wave I were less likely to also
report purging at Wave II or III, and purging at Wave I
was not associated with a difference in the likelihood of
purging between Wave II and III. It is possible that this
inverse relationship is a byproduct of how purging was
measured in this study, given that the variable only
reflected purging behavior over the last seven days.
More frequent longitudinal assessments might better
capture the extent to which purging behavior is stable
between adolescence and young adulthood.

Additionally, our study confirmed several risk factors
for purging that have been shown to predict risk for eat-
ing disorders in previous studies, and identified previ-
ously understudied time varying effects for several of
these variables. For example, self-perception of being
overweight significantly predicted purging at Wave II
but not at Wave III. Research consistently has found that
body image concern (operationalized in a variety of ways
in different studies) contributed to increased risk for eat-
ing disorder symptoms [2,28] and, therefore, has been
targeted as a key risk factor to be addressed in preven-
tion programs [29]. However, our results suggest that
this may only be a risk factor over a certain time range.
Given the stability of these risk factors over time, it's
surprising that some Wave I predictors that showed sig-
nificant relationships at Wave II did not predict Wave
III purging behaviors. Again, more intensive longitudinal
data collection would be useful to more clearly deter-
mine how risk factors may affect the likelihood of pur-
ging between adolescence and young adulthood.
Similarly, consistent with previous studies, low self-
esteem, [28] depression, [28,30,31] and impulsivity [32-34]
were significantly associated with increased risk for pur-
ging. In addition, we found significant relationships be-
tween purging and self-reported suicide attempts as well as
between purging and having received psychological coun-
seling. In a series of case control studies, Fairburn and
colleagues found that "parental separation" (e.g., due to
prolonged illness) and "parental loss" (e.g., due to death)
were risk factors for developing an eating disorder [35,36].
In our study, never having lived with one (or both) parent
(s) was a risk factor for purging, but having lost a parent to
death was not. We cannot answer whether these discrep-
ant findings are a function of methodological differences
(e.g., case­control design versus longitudinal design; differ-
ences in how the target groups were defined). As noted by
Fairburn and colleagues (35), parental separation and loss
are also risk factors for other psychiatric problems. There-
fore, these parental risk factors may be indirectly associated
with the development of eating disorders. For example,
parental separation or loss may increase the risk of devel-
oping psychiatric problems, which in turn, could increase
the likelihood of eating disorders. Future research that ex-
amines the nature of the association between these paren-
tal factors and eating disorders is important to determine
how parental separation and loss might influence eating
disorder risk in terms of being mediated or moderated by
other risk factors, such as depression. Finally, in our
sample, family poverty was found to be predictive of
purging onset. This bolsters emerging literature that
suggests a relationship between socioeconomic hardship
and unhealthy weight control behaviors [37].
Several limitations need to be acknowledged. Although
Add Health is a large epidemiological study, the sample
still was not large enough to test hypotheses about risk
factors for purging in young adult men. Therefore, our
findings should not be generalized to boys or men. As is
common in large-scale epidemiological studies, key study
variables were measured using self-report questionnaires,
which tend to be less reliable than interview based mea-
sures. Childhood abuse variables as well as the ADHD-IN
and -HI scales were collected retrospectively and were,
therefore, subject to recall errors. Additionally, because
frequency information was not available for the purging
behaviors, we were unable to study severity of the behav-
iors. Interval censoring may also be an issue, given that
questions only addressed purging in the last seven days,
which did not allow us to identify whether those reporting
purging during those days were new onset purgers or
whether they may have purged prior to the assessment
period. As a result, purging is likely to be underestimated.
Finally, information was not available regarding binge eat-
ing behaviors or other extreme weight control behaviors,
such as extreme dietary restrictions or excessive exercise.
Further studies would be needed to compare our results re-
garding purging to these similar unhealthy behaviors.
These limitations were offset by several strengths. The
study involved a community sample, thus not featuring
the limitations inherent in studies of patient samples.
The relatively large sample size afforded us the oppor-
tunity to use multivariable modeling of risk factors for
purging, a relatively uncommon yet clinically important
behavior. As well, Add Health collected data on numer-
ous psychosocial variables, allowing us to explore factors
that have been considered in psychopathology research re-
garding other disorders but less so in studies of eating dis-
orders. Finally, our study covered a considerable period of
time (8 years) from adolescence into early adulthood.
Conclusions
This study prospectively examined risk factors for young
adult purging in a large nationally representative sample
of adolescent females. Results provided support for sev-
eral risk factors for purging that have been shown to
predict risk for eating disorders in previous studies. Fu-
ture research on the development of purging behavior
might include measures of economic adversity and self-
esteem to better predict purging in young adults.
