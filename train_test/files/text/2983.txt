Spine surgery ranks as one of the most common inpa­ tient surgical procedures in the United States. 10 Prelim­ inary analysis of national survey data has indicated that between 1979 and 1990 the estimated number of spine surgeries increased 137%,-9 14 while the  population older than 25 years (on whom almost all these opera­ tions are done) rose only 23%. Using data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey [NHDS], these pre­ vious descriptions of increasing spine surgery rates have not determined what part of the spine was operated on, adjusted rates for the population's increasing age, or indicated the size of the potential sampling error in the estimates of rates. To characterize better the increased

rates, data from the NHDS were used to calculate age­ adjusted rates of hospitalizations for three categories of cervical and lumbar spine surgery: fusion, disc, and exploration/decompression surgery.

■ Methods
Survey. The NHDS is conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS] and samples noninstitu­ tional hospitals in the United States, excluding those of the United States Government. National estimates of the number of hospitalizations can be made using sampling weights of the survey. Hospitals included have 6 beds and an average length of stay :530 days. Each hospitalization is coded for up to seven diagnoses and four procedures, using the Interna­ tional Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Mod­ ification (ICD-9-CM). The sampling unit is the hospitaliza­ tion, not the individual; thus, an individual may contribute more than one hospitalization per year. Data on race are missing for a large percentage of sampled hospitalizations; consequently, race-specific estimates are not presented herein. In 1988, the NHDS' survey design was changed. Because the  new design presents more accurate region-specific esti­ mates, region-specific data are presented only for 1988-90. A comparison of estimates for January to March 1988 found the new design's estimates for spine surgery procedures were lower but not significantly different from that of the old de­
sign.15

Definitions. Hospitalizations were included in this study only if they met all of these criteria: age 25 years; surgical pro­ cedure codes for spinal fusion (ICD-9-CM 81.0, 81.00- 81.09), excision or destruction of an intervertebral disc (80.5, 80.50-80.59), or exploration and decompression of spinal canal structures (03.0, 03.01-03.09); and were classified as cervical and/or lumbar, as described later.
   Each hospitalization was placed in one of three categories. The fusion category included hospitalizations with procedure codes for (1) spinal fusion; (2) bone graft (77.7, 78.0) plus excision or destruction of an intervertebral disc; or (3} bone graft plus exploration and decompression of spinal canal structures. The disc category included hospitalizations not in the fusion category that had procedure codes for (1) excision or destruction of an intervertebral disc; or (2) exploration and decompression of spinal canal structures plus a diagnosis code for an intervertebral disc disorder (722, 722.0-722.9). The exploration/decompression category included hospitalizations

are based on sample-weighted data. Crude rates of the esti­ mated number of hospitalizations per 100,000 persons 25 years old were calculated using annual population estimates from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Rates were adjusted for age by the direct method using the 1990 United States census population as the standard. Age-adjusted rates were used so that increases in the rates presented would not be due to a changing age distribution in the population.
  A rate's standard error was calculated using tables and

not in the fusion or disc categories that had a procedure code for exploration and decompression of spinal canal structures. Diagnosis and procedure codes were used to classify hos­ pitalizations as cervical, thoracic, thoracolumbar, and/or lum­ bar. The codes defining cervical and lumbar are listed in Table
1. Except as described later, hospitalizations with diagnoses or
procedures on the cervical or lumbar list were classified as such. For fusion cases, if a hospitalization had a thoracic-, thoracolumbar-, or lumbar-fusion procedure code and a cer­ vical diagnosis code but no cervical-fusion procedure code, then the hospitalization was not classified as cervical. For disc cases, if a hospitalization had a thoracic- or lumbar -disc dis­ order diagnosis code and a cervical diagnosis code not for a disc disorder, then the hospitalization was not classified as cervical. Analogous methods were used to classify hospitaliza­ tions as lumbar. Of the estimated number of hospitalizations classified as cervical, 2.1% were classified also as lumbar.

to estimate the rate's relative standard error.
Rates' 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] that are presented were calculated using a critical value of 1.96 standard devia­ tions. Because multiple comparisons were done among region­ specific rates, another set of confidence limits was calculated (but not presented) for these rates, using a critical value of 2.64, as per the Bonferroni method; 23 differences among region-specific rates were considered significant if these confi­ dence intervals did not overlap.
  To evaluate a trend in a rate, the rate's average percentage change per year was estimated using weighted least-squares linear regression (using GENCAT18 ), with the independent variable being the year and the dependent variable being the rate's natural logarithm. A rate's average percentage change per year is equal to e8 -1.16 A trend was considered significant if the 95% CI of the percentage change per year did not include zero.
   An estimate was made of the additional number of hospi­ talizations with spine surgery that would have occurred in 1990 at the rate from 1988-90 than at that from 1979-81. This was done by multiplying the number  of  persons  25 years old in 1990 by the age- and sex-adjusted rates from 1979-81 and 1988-90, and then calculating the difference.

  For cervical fusion surgery, intervertebral disc disor­ der was the most frequent diagnosis (58.3% of hospi­ talizations), followed by spondylosis (27.1%). Forcer­ vical disc surgery, the most frequent diagnoses were intervertebral disc disorder (86.4% of hospitalizations) and spondylosis (19.8%). For cervical exploration/ decompression surgery, spondylosis was a diagnosis in 64.7% of hospitalizations, followed by brachial neuritis or radiculitis (26.1%), and spinal stenosis (13.9%).
Lumbar Spine Surgery
From 1979-81 to 1988-90, the estimated  average number of hospitalizations with lumbar spine surgery increased from 148,000 per year to 250,000 per year. During this period, the age-ad justed rate of hospitaliza-

tions with lumbar spine surgery among men increased 46% (from 136 to 199 per 100,000 persons per year), and among women increased 35% (from 92 to 124 per 100,000 persons per year) (Figure 2). From 1979 to 1990, the rate's average percentage increase per year for men was 4.0% (95% CI: 3.0-4.9) and for women was 3.8% (95% CI: 2.9- 4.8), indicating significant increas­ ing trends for each sex.
  Inspection of the rates of hospitalizations with lum­ bar spine surgery suggests that the trend towards in­ creasing rates might have abated by the late 1980s (Fig­ ure 2). However, this apparent plateau might be due in part to the 1988 change in the NHDS survey design, which probably resulted in lower estimates for rates of hospitalizations with spine surgery.
  From 1979-81 to 1988-90, the estimated average number of hospitalizations per year with lumbar fusion surgery more than doubled (Table 2). In each sex the age-adjusted rate of hospitalizations with this surgery
increased  >60%  (Table 3). For  lumbar  fusion surgery,

  From 1979-81 to 1988-90, in both sexes the age­ adjusted rate of hospitalizations with lumbar explora­ tion/decompression surgery increased >65% (Table 3). This reflected significant trends towards higher rates for this surgery (Table 4).
  For 1988-90, the western United States had the low­ est and the southern United States had the highest rates of hospitalizations with lumbar fusion surgery, lumbar disc surgery, and all lumbar spine surgery combined (Table 5). For lumbar disc surgery and all lumbar spine surgery combined, these differences were statistically significant.
  An estimated 74,000 more hospitalizations with lum­ bar spine surgery would have occurred in 1990 at the age- and sex-adjusted rates from 1988-90 than at those from 1979-81. Of these additional hospitalizations," 62% were due to lumbar disc surgery. Persons ;;;:65 years old, who comprised 20% of the 1990 population
;;;:25 years old, accounted for 35% of the additional hospitalizations.
  For lumbar fusion surgery, intervertebral disc disor­ der was a diagnosis in 51.0% of hospitalizations, fol­ lowed by spondylolisthesis (24.3% ), spinal stenosis (10.5%), spondylosis (10.0%), and vertebral fracture (7.3%). For lumbar disc surgery, intervertebral disc dis­ order w_as a diagnosis in 97.0% of hospitalizations. For lumbar exploration/decompression surgery, spinal ste­ nosis was a diagnosis in 69.4% of hospitalizations, fol­ lowed by spondylosis (20.4%), spondylolisthesis (11.0%), and neuritis or radiculitis (7.1%).
■ Discussion
Using data from an annual national survey of hospital­ izations, this study found that rates of hospitalizations with cervical and lumbar spine surgery increased mark­ edly between 1979 and 1990. The increases involved

neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons per capita in­ creased by 24%.1 Although some of these surgeons do not perform spine surgery, the number of spine surgeons per capita also probably increased. This increase might account for part of the increased spine surgery rates.
  The increased rates might be due in part to the ac­ ceptance during the 1980s of magnetic resonance imag­ ing [MRI] as a routine method for investigating the spine. Because of its advantages over computed tomog­ raphy and myelography, 6 30 MRI might have detected some spinal abnormalities that required surgery and previously would have gone undetected. These detec­ tions could have increased rates of spine surgery.
  Magnetic resonance imaging detects major abnor­ malities in more than 20% of asymptomatic persons' cervical and lumbar spines.2 24 In some persons with neck and back pain, a spinal abnormality detected by MRI may be only a coincidental finding. In such per­ sons, attributing the pain to the MRI-detected abnor­ mality might increase rates of inappropriate surgery. One expert has voiced concern that spine surgeons at times are operating based on MRI-detected abnormali­ ties that have not been correlated adequately with pa­ tients' symptoms and signs.17
  In many patients with sciatica, the need for lumbar disc surgery is not clear. 27 Developments during the 1980s might have shifted decision-making towards sur­ gery. The development of microlumbar discectomy per­ mits a less traumatic but accurate approach to the in­ tervertebral space, although microlumbar discectomy's cure rate 32 ·is no higher than that of previous methods. Confirmatory images of a herniated disc might be ob­ tained earlier using MRI than previously using myelog­ raphy or computed tomography. The availability of these images early in a patient's course and of microlum­ bar discectomy as an alternative surgical technique might have led physicians and patients to choose surgery more readily during the 1980s.
  The increased rate of lumbar disc surgery among persons ;;;:65 years old could reflect a trend, seen also in

different categories of surgery and occurred among both

cardiac-bypass surgery,10

,	to consider elderly per­

sexes.
  Because the rates presented were age-adjusted, a change in the population's age distribution does not explain the increase. Diagnosis-related groups' intro­ duction in the mid-1980s into the health-financing pro­ cess also is unlikely to account for the observed increase; for a given spine-related diagnosis, all procedure codes used in this study (except one rarely used code) result in classification into the same diagnosis-related group.33 Changes in lifestyle or the workplace would probably not have led to an increase in disease incidence that could account for the increased rates of surgery. The enormous costs of low back pain in the workplace have prompted efforts to prevent it.5
  Surgery rates are influenced by the ratio of surgeons to population.31 Between 1980 and 1990, the number of

sons as candidates for surgery previously reserved for younger persons.20 The high prevalence of MRI-detect­ able lumbar spine abnormalities among the elderly2 also might account for some of this increased rate of disc surgery.
  Of the surgical categories studied, cervical fusion and lumbar fusion had the highest average percentage in­ creases in their rates. These increases could be due in part to the frequent development of new techniques for cervical and lumbar fusion.28 In addition, lumbar fusio·n often is done to correct spinal instability, but determin­ ing instability or that it is causing pain is difficult.7 This creates uncertainty about treatment, which in  turn  might have allowed the increases in rates to occur.
  Because the NHDS samples hospitalizations and not individuals, it can not be used to distinguish between

first versus repeat spine operations. Twelve to fourteen percent of lumbar operations are repeat operations.3 8 32 The higher rates of lumbar surgery resulted in an esti­ mated 74,000 additional hospitalizations with lumbar surgery in 1990. An analysis found that if repeat oper­ ations accounted for 12% of all hospitalizations with lumbar surgery in 1979-81, then for half the additional lumbar surgery to be accounted for by repeat opera­ tions, the percentage would need to have risen by 1988-90 to 23%, which would be a very high percent­ age (H. Davis, unpublished data). This suggests that most of the incre_ase in lumbar spine surgery was not due to repeat operations.
   The finding that the western United States had a lower rate of hospitalizations with spine surgery con­ trasts with a previous report that used data from the 1986 NHDS.5 The 1988 change in survey design of the NHDS resulted in lower estimates for the number of hospitalizations in the western United States. An analy­ sis by NCHS concluded that these lower estimates for the West were more accurate than the estimates made for the few years befor·e the change.15 As a result, this study used region-specific data only for 1988 to 1990. The western United States's lower rate of spine sur­ gery might reflect its lower overall rate of inpatient surgery.10 •13 Although the southern United States had higher rates of spine surgery, it does not have a higher overall rate of inpatient surgery.10 •13 Rates of inpatient surgery are determined by the disease prevalence, con­ sensus on a treatment's benefits, number of hospital beds and surgeons, health-care financing system, and physicians' practice styles.25 31 An analysis of county­ wide rates of surgery for low back pain in Washington state could account for only a small part of the variation in rates.26 The factors that account for the West's lower and South's higher rate of spine surgery are not known. A study using Medicare data for 1979 to 1990 could confirm the increased rate of spine surgery among the elderly. Also useful would be studies of trends in spine surgery rates in prepaid-practice settings. The increased rates of spine surgery raise the question of what propor­ tion of the additional operations were required to effec­ tively treat neck and low back pain. Research is being done currently on the effectiveness of different treat­ ments for low back pain.4 Given the sequelae that can follow spine surgery,19 the high cost of the surgery, and that control of health-care costs is a national priority, a strong need exists for better clarification of which pa­
tients should have a given type of spine surgery.

Dr. Davis' paper presents important information about utilization rates of cervical and lumbar spine surgery in the United States, demonstrating significant increases in disc excision, fusion and decompression procedures for men and women, and particularly, the elderly. He also reports significant regional differences in inpatient sur­ gical rates with southern regional rates of cervical pro­ cedures occurring 170% more frequently than in the west. Lumbar procedures occur more than 150% more frequently in the same area. Other epidemiologic anal­ yses have also demonstrated marked differences across states, regions and na tions.1 2
  These data represent a sample of procedures-not every admission and procedure is counted. Because of the large sample size and long history of this data base, the overall trends and analyses are probably accurate. Other data bases such as Medicare and state hospital


discharge data bases could be analyzed to provide con­ firmatory information.
  As Dr. Davis indicates, it is difficult to understand an increase in rates of cervical and lumbar surgery which is much greater than the growth of the population. He suggests that the plateau in overall lumbar surgical pro­ cedures beginning in 1984 (especially in men) may be partly related to a change in the NHDS survey design, but why would cervical surgery rates continue to show an increase throughout this period? Chymopapain and short stay admissions are not included in the analysis. Though they account for a small number of procedures, it would seem advisable to count them, particularly the short stay procedures. The increasing use of new tech­ nologies requiring one day or no hospitalization should be captured in these analyses. Among the explanatory factors for the variations which are discussed, I would
