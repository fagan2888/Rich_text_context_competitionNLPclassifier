We recognized that many health outcomes are associated with air pollution, but in this project launched by the US EPA, the intent was to assess the role
of exposure to ambient air pollutants as risk factors only for respiratory effects in children. The NHANES-III database is a valuable resource for assessing
children's respiratory health and certain risk factors, but lacks monitoring data to estimate subjects' exposures to ambient air pollutants. Since the 1970s,
EPA has regularly monitored levels of several ambient air pollutants across the country and these data may be used to estimate NHANES subject's
exposure to ambient air pollutants. The first stage of the project eventually evolved into assessing different estimation methods before adopting the
estimates to evaluate respiratory health. Specifically, this paper describes an effort using EPA's AIRS monitoring data to estimate ozone and PM10 levels
at census block groups. We limited those block groups to counties visited by NHANES-III to make the project more manageable and apply four different
interpolation methods to the monitoring data to derive air concentration levels. Then we examine method-specific differences in concentration levels and
determine conditions under which different methods produce significantly different concentration values. We find that different interpolation methods do
not produce dramatically different estimations in most parts of the US where monitor density was relatively low. However, in areas where monitor density
was relatively high (i.e., California), we find substantial differences in exposure estimates across the interpolation methods. Our results offer some insights
into terms of using the EPA monitoring data for the chosen spatial interpolation methods.

Introduction
Many aspects of the outdoor environment, including air
quality, can adversely affect health in general. But outdoor
air quality may be the most influential factor, among others,
in affecting respiratory health. A number of studies have
examined the relationships between ambient air quality and
respiratory health effects (Detels et al., 1987; Abbey et al.,
1991; Schwartz et al., 1994; Brunekreef et al., 1995; Pope
et al., 1995a, b; Kunzli et al., 1997; McConnell et al., 1999;
Norris et al., 1999). One approach to investigating these
relationships is to collect environmental data coincidentally
with health data so that the environmental data can
directly support analysis of health outcomes (Stern et al.,
1989; Thurston et al., 1992; Schwartz et al., 1994; Linn
et al., 1996; Vedal et al., 1998; Peters et al., 1999). As studies
of this type are costly, they are typically conducted over
relatively confined areas with small sample sizes. An alternate
approach is to use existing health and environmental
databases.
Unfortunately, most databases for general health surveys
do not have detailed environmental and/or air quality
information. Commonly used health data sets include the
series of National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES). The National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) completed the third NHANES
(NHANES-III, 1988­1994). This NHANES data set
provides very detailed health information on a statistically
representative sample of the US population. NHANES-III

includes a series of survey questions on various aspects of
health history of the subjects, including detailed respiratory
health data and quantitative spirometry tests of respiratory
function. These data provide a rich source of health outcome
data that potentially can be linked to exposure estimates of
ambient air pollution, but they do not provide any air quality
information. The lack of air quality information is not
unique in HNAHES, but is quite common among general
health survey data.
Many researchers have used EPA air-monitoring data
to estimate ambient air exposure as risk factors for
human health effects. Using NHANES as an example, we
are aware of only several studies that have already linked this
data set to environmental exposure estimates derived from
EPA air quality data to assess potential associations between
environmental exposures and health effects. Chestnut et al.
(1991) used EPA air-monitoring data to examine the
association between total suspended particulates and lung
function in adults from an earlier NHANES-I survey.
Schwartz (1989) estimated ambient air concentrations of
pollutants based on EPA monitoring data and then linked
these estimates to NHANES-II children's respiratory func-
tion data. A recent study by Schwartz (2001) used
NHANES-III data to examine air pollutants as cardiovas-
cular risk factors.
In these studies, air pollution and health data were
collected in independent surveys, so that human subjects'
residences and air monitors were not colocated. As a result,
air pollution concentrations needed to be interpolated
between monitors in order to estimate exposures to study
subjects. At this time, no consensus exists as to the
appropriate method for interpolating between irregularly
spaced monitors. Indeed, the NHANES-based studies
cited above all used different interpolation methods.
Chestnut et al. (1991) identified a central urban area for
each NHANES-I location and averaged all monitoring
data located in that area. Schwartz (1989) assigned
subjects the average of pollutant levels from all monitors
located within 10 miles of the population centroid of the
census tract in which they resided. Schwartz (2001) used the
weighted average of all monitors in each subject's county of
residence plus the adjoining counties. These weights were
proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance
between the centroid of the residence's block group and the
monitor.
Given that different interpolation methods are found in the
literature for estimating ambient air quality to assess health
outcomes, our objective is to evaluate spatial interpolation
methods methodically to assess the degree to which different
methods influence the estimated air pollutant levels. Many
papers have attempted to interpolate levels of air pollutants
and some efforts intended to incorporate more than one
measurement (e.g., Brown et al., 1994) and explore their
relationships to health outcomes (e.g., Duddek et al., 1995).
The current paper addresses a much simpler type of situation
with only one measurement in each estimation process. Our
ultimate objective is to evaluate how different interpolation
methods will affect the assessment of relationships between
air pollutant levels and respiratory health captured by
NHANES data, but our results reported in this paper will
be applicable to the analysis of other health outcomes related
to air pollutants.
Methods and materials
Data
In NHANES-III, data were gathered from 82 unique
counties across the country from 1988 to 1994, including
almost 14,000 children up to 16 years of age. NCHS
collected address information to geocode each subject to the
nearest census block group (BG), which, in general, contains
between 600 and 3000 people with an optimal size of 1500
people (http://www.census.gov). But NCHS does not release
this information to the public in order to protect subjects'
confidentiality. Only the identification of the county in which
the subject resided is available to the public, provided the
county had a population of greater than 500,000. Approxi-
mately half of the children in NHANES-III resided in these
large counties. The remaining children resided in small
counties that are not identified by NCHS in the public
database.
In order to meet Clean Air Act requirements, every
state has established a network of air-monitoring stations
for regulated pollutants (CO, NO2
, O3
, lead, PM10
, and
SO2
). Data from these monitors are submitted to and
stored in EPA's AIRS database. The vast majority of
these monitors sample air quality in the country's
densely populated urban areas. Based on the current
scientific evidence of associations between exposure to
various air pollutants and adverse respiratory health
effects (Detels et al., 1987; Abbey et al., 1991; Schwartz
et al., 1994; Brunekreef et al., 1995; Pope et al., 1995a, b;
Kunzli et al., 1997; McConnell et al., 1999; Norris et al.,
1999), we limited our study to estimating exposures
to O3
, PM10
, NO2
, and SO2
. This paper presents our
methods and results for estimating exposures to outdoor
ambient levels of O3
and PM10
for 1990 for illustrative
purposes only. Owing to confidentiality constraints, we
needed to estimate ambient air concentrations in every BG
in every county in which NHANES-III subjects resided.
These estimates were then linked to subjects by NCHS
personnel using the confidential location information for
subsequent analyses. For this preliminary work, we linked
all the NHANES-III children to the 1990 concentration
estimates, but eventually, we will link children by the
year when they were examined to the year-specific monitored
data.

Exposure Metrics
The AIRS database reports O3
as an hourly average
concentration. O3
concentrations usually exhibit a daily
diurnal pattern and a seasonal pattern. Owing to the strong
seasonality of O3
concentrations, many states limit their O3
monitoring to a certain portion of the year, termed the ozone
season, the length of which varies from one area of the
country to another (US EPA, 1996a). As we were interested
in chronic health effects, we sought to identify one statistic
that would characterize long-term exposure to O3
at each
location. Little consensus exists as to which statistic is the
most appropriate. The US EPA (1996a) recommended the
maximum 8-h moving average as an appropriate statistic.
Based upon this recommendation and our analysis of O3
diurnal and seasonal patterns in the NHANES-III counties,
we decided, as an initial effort, to compute a ``summer
daytime ozone'' metric defined as the hourly average from
May to September, between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm.
The AIRS database reports PM10
concentrations every
sixth day for a 24-h sampling period (US EPA, 1996b). We
characterized exposure to PM10
in 1990 using two metrics.
The first one was the annual average provided by AIRS. As
there is a strong seasonal and geographical pattern in daily
PM10
levels, we also wanted to capture potential exposure
during peak PM10
seasons. To do this, we selected the
calendar quarter with the highest average for each monitor as
the maximum quarterly average, our second PM10
metric.
Both averages are weighted, with the weights adjusting for
changes to the scheduled sampling frequency of the monitors.
Quality Assurance of AIRS Data
To develop estimates of O3
and PM10
concentrations for each
BG with an NHANES-III child, we tested four spatial
interpolation methods. Before conducting the interpolation
procedures, we performed validation procedures to ensure
that (1) the monitored data were valid and/or sufficiently
complete to be used in the study, and (2) the monitor
location information was correct.
(1) Evaluation of monitoring data completeness/validity:
Based on the current literature (Schwartz, 1989; Abbey et al.,
1991; Kinney et al., 1998; Nikiforov et al., 1998), we
established the following rules for determining if monitored
data were valid and appropriate for inclusion in our study.
For daytime summer O3
, we required: (1) at least eight valid
hourly readings out of nine during the specified time interval
(10:00 am to 6:00 pm, at the hour) for that day's reading to
be included into the daily average; and (2) at least 75%, or
115 days (out of 153 days), of valid day readings from May
to September for that monitor to be included into the
summer daytime average.
For each PM10
monitor, AIRS records the percent of
actual data values that were reported as compared to the
number of data values that should have been reported for the
monitor/year or quarter (PCT_OBS). We computed the
minimum value of PCT_OBS for each quarterly interval for
each monitor, and required that at least 75% of the possible
samples be taken in every quarter of the year for that monitor
to be included. Using this value ensured that all four quarters
in the year had been sufficiently sampled.
(2) Evaluation of monitor location information: Primary
location information presented in the AIRS database consists
of (1) the latitude and longitude of each monitor, and (2) a
monitor identification number whose first five digits are the
FIPS code of the state and county in which the monitor is
supposed to be located. We mapped monitor locations based
on their reported latitude and longitude readings. We
compared counties as identified by the first five digits of the
monitor identification number and the counties where the
monitors were located according to their latitude and
longitude readings, assuming that the first five digits of the
monitor identification numbers represented the monitor's
correct state and county. Thus, any mistakes in AIRS on the
location of a monitor were assumed to be the result of
incorrect latitude/longitude entries. As a result, we made
minor latitude or longitude adjustments on two of 739 O3
and two of 732 PM10
monitors.
Interpolation Methods
We selected four different interpolation methods to estimate
O3
and PM10
air concentrations at the census BG level.
These methods have been used either in NHANES-related
studies (Schwartz, 1989, 2001; Chestnut et al., 1991) or other
studies (Abbey et al., 1991; Kinney et al., 1998; Mulholland
et al., 1998; Nikiforov et al., 1998). The four methods were
(1) spatial averaging, (2) nearest neighbor, (3) inverse
distance weighting, and (4) kriging.
All four methods are weighted average methods, and they
all have the same basic mathematical formulation. That is,
we want to compute the air pollution concentration, z at an
unsampled point, x0
, given a set of neighboring sampled
values zi
, sampled at locations denoted by xi
. The
interpolating relationship is
zðx0
Þ ¼

Á zðxi
Þ0 and
X

where li
represents the weights assigned to each of the
neighboring values, and the sum of the weights is one. For
these approaches, interpolation involves: (a) defining the
search area or neighborhood around the point to be
predicted; (b) locating the observed data points within this
neighborhood; and (c) assigning appropriate weights to each
of the observed data points.
The four interpolation methods differ only in their choice
of sample weights. In brief, with spatial averaging, we
selected all sampled values within a fixed distance from the
point of interest and assigned the same fractional weight,
based on the number of monitors, to each of them. With the
nearest-neighbor method, we chose only the single sampled

value that was closest to the point of interest and assigned it a
weight of 1. With inverse distance weighting, we assigned
samples that were closer to the point of interest of
correspondingly larger weights; and with kriging, we assigned
weights based on the spatial autocorrelation statistics of the
sampled data set.
(1) Spatial averaging: Several studies (Chestnut et al.,
1991; Kinney et al., 1998) have used what we refer to as the
spatial averaging method. Schwartz (1989) also used spatial
averaging to study air pollution as a risk factor for
decrements in children's lung function. Even though we
believe that using 10 miles as the neighborhood definition in
Schwartz's study was subjective and not well justified, we
replicated Schwartz's (1989) approach so that we could
directly compare our results to his work. Therefore, for each
county with an NHANES-III child, we selected all O3
and
PM10
monitors within 10 miles of each BG centroid,
calculated the average of the values from the selected
monitors and assigned that value to the appropriate BG. If
no monitor was found within 10 miles of a particular BG,
then that BG was assigned a missing value for the specific
pollutant.
(2) Nearest neighbor: Each BG was assigned the air
concentration level of the monitor nearest to its centroid
regardless of how far away the monitor was located. This
eliminated the search radius as a parameter in the interpola-
tion (Detels et al., 1987; Schwartz and Zeger, 1990; Stern
et al., 1994; Kunzli et al., 1997; Vedal et al., 1998).
(3) Inverse distance weighting (IDW): Interpolation
weights in IDW are computed as a function of the distance
between observed sample sites and the site at which the
prediction has to be made (Gunnink and Burrough, 1996).
As observed values that were closer to the point of interest
were more heavily weighted, a larger search window could be
used that still preserved some of the local variations in
pollutant levels. Data from all monitors within a 250 km
search window were included in the IDW interpolation for
both PM10
and O3
. The 250 km radius was chosen to ensure
that all block groups in the counties of interest had an
interpolated value for both O3
and PM10
. We have tested
other smaller windows (60 and 100 km), but through cross-
validation, we found that the accuracy of interpolation was
not too sensitive to the window size. However, choosing
smaller windows will leave some of the block groups of
interest without an estimated value. Similar to Abbey et al.
(1991), Kinney et al. (1998), and Kunzli et al. (1997), we
used li
¼ 1/di
as the weight, where di
is the distance between
sets of data points and the point to be predicted (Burrough
and McDonnell, 1998).
(4) Kriging: The spatial variation of air pollution
measurements is complex but is not generally unstructured.
It is almost always spatially dependent on some scale, with
this dependence referred to as spatial autocorrelation
(Griffith, 1988; Bailey and Gatrell, 1995). This structure
may then be overlain by more or less random local variation.
The whole can be described by a variogram that summarizes
the variation.
A variogram expresses the degree of similarity between two
observations separated by a given distance (the lag). An
empirical variogram can be computed from sampled data
using the following expression:
gðhÞ ¼
1
2MðhÞ
X
MðhÞ
i¼1
fzðxi
Þ À zðxi
þ hÞg2 ð2Þ
where g(h) is the estimated semivariance at a separation
distance, or lag h, z(xi
) and z(xi
þh) are the observed values
at xi
and xi
þh separated by h, of which there are M(h) pairs
(Oliver, 1996). In most cases, the semivariance increases as
the distance separating pairs of points (i.e., the lag) increases,
indicating that points close together tend to have more
similar values than those far apart.
The basic idea behind a kriged interpolation is to use the
variogram to compute weights li
, which minimize the
variance in the estimated value. The first step in this process
is to fit a function to the empirical variogram such that
semivariances can be computed at all separation distances, or
lags. For this study, we used spherical variograms for all of
the models (Burrough and McDonnell, 1998). We chose the
spherical specification because it is one of the most commonly
chosen forms, and the purpose of our study is to compare
commonly used methods. Once the model variogram is fit to
the empirical data, it is used to compute the weights li
such
that the estimation variance is less than the variance for any
other linear combination of the observed values (Isaaks and
Srinivasta, 1989).
Computing the empirical variogram requires that one first
selects regions over which the sampled processes can be
reasonably assumed to be homogeneous, with a constant
mean and variance. For PM10
, we followed the precedent of
EPA (1996b), in which the country was divided into seven
aerosol regions, each with similar PM10
characteristics.
Owing to the location of the monitors relative to our
counties of interest and the boundaries of the seven regions,
we made minor changes to the boundaries of two regions and
ended up with five PM10
regions (Northwest, Southern
California, Southeast, Industrial Midwest, and Northeast)
covering most of the NHANES counties (see Figure 1). We
computed separate variograms for annual average and
quarterly maximum PM10
for each of our five regions. As
indicated in Figure 1, we did not specify a Southwest region.
Although this area had several NHANES-III counties of
interest, there were too few PM10
monitors, as indicated in
Figure 2, to support kriging.
Our development of variograms for O3
kriging differed
from the approach we used for PM10
. We examined the
spatial statistics for each of the counties of interest and
looked for evidence of spatial continuity, or the presence of
spatial autocorrelation patterns. Unfortunately, all regions of

interest, except Southern California, did not exhibit a spatial
autocorrelation pattern of O3
. Therefore, we could not justify
dividing the country into O3
regions analogous to the PM10
regions.
Several different forms of kriging are commonly used.
With simple kriging one assumes that the mean value is
known, while with ordinary kriging the mean value is
determined during the interpolation. For nonstationary
variation, where there is drift (or trend) in the data, universal
kriging or kriging with intrinsic random functions should be
used (Oliver, 1996; Mulholland et al., 1998). We adopted
ordinary kriging for all the interpolations for O3
and PM10
.

In the current study, we observed situations in which a
statistically significant drift could be detected in the sampled
data; however, the sources of the drift were not evident. As
such, we believed that it was better to apply the more
conservative ordinary kriging approach, rather than to risk
extrapolating the data drift to areas in which no drift exists.
Results
Of the 830 ozone monitors in the US and its territories in
1990, 739 met our data validity criteria. Of the 1473 PM10
monitors in the US and its territories in 1990, 768 met our
validity criteria. Several PM10
monitors were located at the
same site. We computed the mean values of the colocated
monitors, resulting in 732 distinct monitoring locations. Two
O3
monitors and two PM10
monitors were in the correct
state, but actually several counties away from the correct
county indicated by the monitor's ID. By adjusting either the
reported latitude or longitude, but not both for each monitor,
assuming that errors were incurred on entering the coordinate
information, we were able to place all four monitors into the
correct counties, but not necessarily the exact locations,
based on their identification numbers. The locations of the
739 O3
monitors and 732 PM10
monitors are shown in
Figure 2. Although the O3
and PM10
monitors were separate
and distinct, both types of monitors appear to be colocated in
some instances.
Table 1 presents summary descriptive statistics for the 1990
data of the 739 O3
and 732 PM10
monitors. Most of the
extreme O3
values (highest and lowest) were recorded in
California. Maximum PM10
levels were observed in the
eastern part of the country primarily in the summer, and in
the western part of the country primarily in the fall and
winter. This is similar to the patterns noted in EPA (1996b).
Summer Daytime Ozone: Interpolated Values
Only the variograms computed for California showed
characteristics of spatial continuity for summer daytime
ozone. Variograms computed for the other counties of
interest did not display consistent trends with separation
distances, and model variograms could not be fitted to the
data. These findings imply that simple kriging methods may
not be appropriate for those places. Therefore, kriging was
conducted for O3
in California only. Table 1 also presents
summary statistics based on the results of the four
interpolation methods for all the counties of interest. Of the
56,721 BGs within the counties of interest, we could not
conduct spatial averaging in 15% of these BGs because they
did not have at least one O3
monitor within 10 miles of their
centroid. Also, the summary statistics for kriging were based
only on the counties in California where variograms could be
constructed.
The four methods produced fairly different estimates of air
pollution concentrations between sample locations. Mapped
examples of the interpolations of O3
for Los Angeles county
are shown in Figure 3. IDW predicted a fairly uniform
concentration across the entire county, with a slight decrease
toward the coast. Kriged values increased much more
strongly from the coast to the inland. Nearest-neighbor
interpolations were a patchwork of areas of constant values,
and spatial averaging was notable in the number of locations
in the county for which interpolated values were not
computed. Note that air pollution concentrations are
displayed in these maps only at the resolution of BGs, so
isopleths reflect BG boundaries and are not smooth.

As kriging was limited to California, we could only
compare all four methods for counties in that state. The
method-specific mean summer daytime O3
values for all
13,326 BGs in California were: 53.3 ppb (IDW), 49.5 ppb
(spatial averaging), 49.4 ppb (kriging), and 49.2 ppb (nearest
neighbor). The mean value for IDW was significantly larger
than the other three means (based upon Duncan and Tukey
significance of means tests, P o 0.05), while the mean values
for the other three methods were not significantly different
from each other. These comparison tests were not strictly
valid statistically because significant spatial autocorrelation
existed in each sample, but they provided a useful means of
interpreting the trends in the data.
PM10
Annual Average and Maximum Quarterly Average:
Interpolated Values
Model variograms were fit to empirical data in each of the
five PM10
aerosol regions (Figure 4). The strongest signals of
spatial continuity, as shown in Figure 4, were found in the
Southeast, Northwest, and Southern California regions.
Evidence of spatial continuity in the Northeast and Industrial
Midwest was much less definitive. In particular, semivar-
iances computed for the Industrial Midwest remained less
than the total sample variance until separation distances of
approximately 700 km. This separation distance indicates a
lack of spatial continuity in that region.
Table 1 also provides summary statistics for annual
average PM10
based on the results of the four different
interpolation methods for all the counties of interest. We
could not conduct spatial averaging in 26% of the 56,721
BGs, because they did not have at least one PM10
monitor
within 10 miles of their centroid. Kriging was not performed
in 4.6% of the total BGs where they were in the four counties
in southwestern US not included in the five PM10
regions (see
the kriging discussion in the last section).
The four interpolation methods were also performed,
where appropriate, for the maximum quarterly PM10
averages. The last part in Table 1 presents summary statistics
based on the results of the four different interpolation
methods for all the counties of interest. Even though the
absolute levels of the estimates based upon the maximum
quarterly averages were higher than those based upon the
annual averages, they correlated very well spatially so that
the relative levels for PM10
maximum quarterly averages
were similar to those using annual average PM10
metric.
Interpolated Method Comparisons
To compare interpolation results, we computed correlation
coefficients for pairs of methods across counties. The
coefficients between predictions from pairs of interpolation
methods were generally high (from 0.80 to 0.97). The lowest
correlation (0.80) was observed in comparing O3
estimates
between IDW and kriging and between IDW and the nearest
neighbor. Correlation coefficients for most pairs of methods
exceeded 0.9.
We also examined the range of estimates across all of the
interpolations within each BG by computing the difference
between the highest and lowest interpolated values. We were

able to perform all four methods only in California (11,934
BGs). The range values for O3
were distributed approxi-
mately normally, implying that differences in interpolation
estimates were moderately high for a substantial percentage
of BGs. The distributions of the ranges for the annual and
maximum quarterly averages of PM10
were similar to each
other in that most BGs have ranges below 15 mg/m3, with the
majority of values less than 7 mg/m3. As less than 25% of all
the BGs of interest had interpolated O3
values from all four
methods, we relaxed the comparison criterion for O3
slightly
by including BGs, provided two or more interpolation
methods were used. This resulted in a positively skewed

distribution of the range similar to that observed for
PM10
annual and quarterly maximum averages. In this case,
more than 50% of BGs had a difference of less than 4 ppb O3
between the highest and lowest interpolation estimates.
To further evaluate the differences in results from different
interpolation methods, we selected a small fraction of the
BGs that actually contained an NHANES subject. We
repeated our analysis of range using these BGs. We created
frequency distributions of block groups by the range
distributions of O3
, and annual and maximum quarterly
averages of PM10
. For all three metrics, the distributions
were positively skewed, indicating that differences in the
estimates derived from different interpolation methods were
relatively small in most of the BGs covered by the NHANES.
w2 statistics indicate that these new distributions were not
significantly different (P o 0.05) from the range distributions
for all 56,721 BGs. We also computed new range distribu-
tions for California, as it was the only state having estimates
of O3
from all four methods. The distribution of the range of
O3
for the selected BGs in California was also not
significantly different from the range distributions of all
counties in California having all four methods applied (w2,
P o 0.05). To assess the geographical distribution of
differences between methods, we computed the maximum
observed range for different annual PM10
estimates within
each of the 82 counties. More than half of the 82 counties
had a maximum range for PM10
estimates less than 10 mg/
m3, a relatively small difference.
So far, our methods adopted to evaluate results from
different interpolation methods are quite lenient. Therefore,
``leave-one-out'' cross-validations were also performed to
provide a more quantitative comparison of the interpolation
methods. By this method, samples were dropped sequentially
and the remaining samples were used to interpolate the value
at the location of the dropped sample. The interpolated
values were plotted and regressed against the actual measured
values, and the R2 value and coefficients from the resulting
regression were examined. Cross-validations for different
interpolation methods (kriging, nearest neighbor, and spatial
average) were performed only in Southern California where
results from all three methods were available. Table 2 reports
some of the results. All methods were minimally biased, with
regression coefficients close to 1. The R2 value for kriging was
the lowest among the three methods for this limited subset of
the data. All three coefficients are significant statistically with
Po0.05. The coefficients for the nearest and spatial
averaging methods are not significantly different from each
other using a 95% confidence interval, but they are signifi-
cantly different both from one and the coefficient for the krig-
ing method (although not significantly different using 90%
confidence intervals). However, the regression coefficients
indicate that kriging produces slightly less biased results than
the other two methods, despite the fact that overall the three
methods perform reasonably well in Southern California.
Discussion
In this initial phase of this project, we have compiled ambient
air pollution data sets and implemented interpolation
methods to estimate air pollution concentrations across the
country at NHANES-III locations. We have also performed
some preliminary comparisons between methods. Based on
this work, we have identified several issues regarding the
implementation of the different interpolation methods, and
we have also drawn some conclusions regarding the
differences between the estimates produced by the different
interpolation methods.
Implementation of Interpolation Methods
Two points regarding the implementation of these different
interpolation methods merit further discussion. First, the
choice of search radius can be important for interpolation by
IDW and by spatial averaging. A large search radius
incorporates monitor values that are very distant from the
point of interest and can lead to smoother interpolated
surfaces. However, a large search radius may also use a
sample that is so distant that its relationship to the air
pollution levels at the location of interest is tenuous.
Conversely, a small search radius can fail to generate
interpolated values for a large subset of locations, but
generally provides more conservative estimates of concentra-
tion values. Little guidance exists for establishing an optimal
value for this search radius, so our methods for choosing
search radii were somewhat ad hoc. For IDW, we selected a
search radius that ensured that the interpolations produced
results for all of the counties of interest in the study. For
spatial averaging, we followed the precedent of Schwartz
(1989) and selected a 10-mile search radius. These decisions
were arbitrary, and exploring the effects of different search
radii was beyond the scope of the present study. Further-
more, in our comparisons between interpolation methods, we
found only small differences for a majority of the study areas,
and for these locations, the search radii probably did not
exert a strong influence on the results.
Second, we achieved limited success in fitting model
variograms to air-monitoring data. Other researchers have
reported similar difficulties in computing variograms from air
pollution concentrations (Lefohn et al., 1987, 1988; Casado
et al., 1994; Liu and Rossini, 1996). For O3
, we were able to
fit variograms for counties in California, but in general, it

appeared that the density of O3
air monitors outside of
California was too sparse to accurately estimate variograms
for other counties of interest. The success of developing the
variograms in California can be explained by two factors.
First, the density of O3
monitors in California was much
greater than anywhere else in the country (Figure 2). Second,
the topography of California is unique, as the urban areas at
the coast are typically bordered by mountains slightly inland.
The mountains present a barrier to the movement of O3
, so
high O3
concentrations persist inland at the base of the
mountain chains, and low O3
concentrations are found near
the coast. Thus, the spatial patterns in the distribution of O3
in California tend to be relatively static. Outside of
California, we found no compelling reason to force
variogram models where the empirical data did not show
characteristics of spatial continuity and did not appear to
support interpolation by kriging. In other words, applica-
tions of kriging techniques to interpolate air pollutant levels
have to be justified by the presence of spatial relationship
captured by the empirical data. Forcing the data into a
kriging framework without empirical evidence may commit
model specification errors.
For PM10
, we observed reasonable evidence of spatial
autocorrelation for three of our five regions (Northwest, LA
Basin, and Southeast), but did not find strong signals in the
Northeast and Industrial Midwest. Again, the different
observed behaviors probably are caused by different monitor
distributions and densities. A visual inspection of monitor
locations suggested that the monitor network was more
highly clustered in the Northeast and Industrial Midwest,
and thus, poorly suited for assessing the degree of spatial
variability in the monitored data. As variograms computed
for PM10
in some of the regions appeared robust, we felt that
it was likely that some spatial continuity existed in the
Industrial Midwest and Northeast. As such, we specified
model variograms for these two regions that best represented
the regional trends suggested by the semivariance values and
that agreed with the patterns established in the other three
regions. This approach may not be the best to deal with ill-
behaved variograms, but for demonstration and illustrative
purposes, we believe the method still produced reasonable
results.
Overall, we believe that the air-monitoring network is
poorly suited for estimating spatial autocorrelation of
aggregated air pollution measurements. The monitors have
historically been placed in locations where exceedences of air
quality standards are expected, and therefore tend to be
clustered in urban areas. Rural areas have relatively few
monitors, and so the distribution of monitors is biased
toward areas of higher pollution concentrations. To compute
accurately the spatial statistics of air pollution distributions,
more evenly distributed monitors are required. This will be
an important issue to consider when we evaluate the linked
NHANES-III and interpolated air concentration data, since
almost half of the children live in more urbanized areas and
half in more rural areas.
Comparisons of Interpolation Methods
In general, correlation coefficients and our analysis of the
range of interpolation estimates in each BG suggest that
different interpolation methods did not generate dramatically
different results in most of the BGs and for most of the
counties visited by NHANES-III. BGs with larger ranges of
interpolated values were mostly found in California within
several major metropolitan areas, and in several cities along
the Northeast Corridor. Note that California is one of the
largest states in terms of population and 25% of the
NHANES-III children live in California.
To better understand the relationships between different
interpolation methods, we compared pairs of methods in
scatter plots. Examples of these plots are shown in Figure 5,
where kriged estimates are plotted against IDW estimates of
annual average PM10
. In Figure 5a, interpolated values for
all of the BGs in the study are shown. The two estimates are
strongly correlated, but internal structures are discernible
within the cloud of points. The origin of these structures can
be better understood when individual scatter plots are drawn
for each county. In Figures 5b and c, we present two
examples of these county-specific plots (Figure 5b: Los
Angeles County, CA, USA and Figure 5c: Duval County,
FL, USA, respectively). These two counties were selected to

show examples of the two distinct types of relationships that
we observed between kriged and IDW estimates.
In Figure 5b, we observed a point pattern that occurred
frequently when comparing IDW and kriging. The plotted
points fell along a shallowly sloped line with several sharp
deviations. These two interpolation methods presented very
different pictures of the distribution of air pollution
concentrations across the county. IDW severely damped
variations in value, so that most estimated values tended
toward a narrow range of values, while kriging estimates
spanned a wider range. Each deviation from the diagonal line
was a manifestation of the IDW-generated egg-shaped region
of sharply higher or lower concentrations that surrounded
monitors within the county (see Figure 3).
More importantly, in the plot for the second county
(Figure 5c: Duval, FL, USA), both IDWand kriged estimate
values fell within a narrow range relative to the range of
possible values observed across the entire country. In
counties with very few or no closely located monitors, we
would expect a narrow range of estimates across the county,
as the variability of air pollution at that location is poorly
quantified, and interpolation methods cannot impute varia-
bility without more monitored values. We observed a similar
narrow distribution of interpolation estimates for more than
half of the NHANES-III counties.
The contrast between Figures 5b and c suggests that the
importance of the interpolation method depends strongly
upon the nature of the local monitor network. In regions of
the country in which monitors are sparse, all interpolation
methods converge to a similar, narrow range of predictions.
When the nearest monitor for a given BG is relatively far
away, different interpolation methods will use the same
monitor for estimation, and therefore the results will be
similar or identical. In areas of the country where monitors
are dense, different interpolation methods can generate vastly
different predictions of the spatial distribution of pollutants
because monitors being used will be weighted differently by
different methods. This conclusion is counterintuitive, but is
well-supported by the results of our study.
Owing to the exploratory nature of this project, many of
our choices of parameters and interpolation methods seemed
arbitrarily constrained by the types of data that were
available and by the nationwide scope of the study area.
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that for a majority of
NHANES study areas where monitors are sparse, the
simplest interpolation method, nearest neighbor, may per-
form as well as any of the other methods. In California and
other locations, where monitor density is relatively high, the
selection of interpolation method must be approached more
carefully. The fundamental issue is whether the spatial
sampling intensity is adequate to capture the spatial
structure, if any, possessed in the data. If the sampling is
too sparse, we may not have sufficient information to
describe the spatial structure if it does exist, and therefore
different methods may not perform dramatically different.
But if we have relatively intense samples and the spatial
structure may be captured, then the selection of the method
should be made with care so that the interpolation method
can fully utilize the spatial information captured by the
samples. Surely, how dense the sample should be is
phenomenon- and geography-dependent.
Kriging is generally thought to produce the most realistic
estimates of values between monitors, and we have success-
fully applied the method for O3
in California and for three
out of the five regions defined for PM10
. Further study will be
required to refine our estimates of the air pollution
concentration and the variances in the estimates. California,
in particular, merits special attention because many (approxi-
mately 25%) NHANES-III subjects resided there and
because gradients in air pollution are relatively strong
between the coastal and inland areas. Therefore, different
interpolation methods will likely change pollutant concentra-
tion estimates significantly for a large number of subjects.
In the very near future, we will attempt to find associations
between air pollution estimates and respiratory health
outcomes using the nationwide NHANES-III sample.
However, the wide range of monitor densities across the
country suggests that the accuracy of the interpolation
estimates will vary greatly. This difference in accuracy may
influence our abilities to draw strong conclusions regarding
the effects of air pollution on respiratory health.
