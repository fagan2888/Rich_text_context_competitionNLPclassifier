Diabetes: Results

Response to Lee et al.
Lee et al. (1) and Diabetes Care deserve
praise for publishing what may be
the first study worldwide to analyze,
in a sample of a general population, serum
concentrations of persistent organic pol-
lutants (POPs) and plasma fasting glu-
cose. The main implication of the study is
that POPs stored in the adipose tissue may
be a key player in the etiopathogenesis of
type 2 diabetes. It is even rational to spec-
ulate that POPs might be, if not "the single
factor" (2), then one factor linking some
core components of the metabolic
syndrome.
In the study by Lee et al. and other
studies (3,4), it seems likely that a rela-
tionship exists between diabetes and
POPs. Hence, patients, clinicians, and
other health professionals may need to
cope with the possible fact that on aver-
age, diabetic subjects have higher concen-
trations of POPs and may thus be more
likely to suffer the adverse effects of POPs.
The mechanistic, clinical, and public
health implications of the study by Lee et al.
are potentially high (1,3­5). However, sev-
eral questions remain unanswered regard-
ing the nature of the relationship between
prevalence of diabetes and population
distribution of POPs (6,7). Therefore, I
would appreciate it if Lee et al. could ad-
dress the following issues.
1) What is the direction of the rela-
tionships with the poverty income ratio?
For example, in Table 1, did wealthier in-
dividuals have lower concentrations of
DDE and higher concentrations of
PCB153 after adjusting for confounders?
2) Many of the estimates (e.g., in Ta-
ble 2) were adjusted for age, sex, race,
income, lipids, BMI, and waist circumfer-
ence. This is coherent with several aims
(e.g., to "isolate" the effect of POPs from
that due to obesity, age, race, or income).
However, adjusting by BMI and waist cir-
cumference may also be an overadjust-
ment, since fat intake is the most common
source of exposure to POPs (1,5) and
since the body burden of some of these
lipophilic chemicals, but not all and not
always, increases with increasing BMI
(8,9). Thus, crude or less adjusted odds
ratios (ORs) would also be relevant for
determining the prevalence of diabetes in
people with specific concentrations of
POPs. Could the authors provide some
crude ORs?
3) The finding that there was no asso-
ciation between obesity and diabetes
among subjects with nondetectable levels
of POPs is highly surprising and calls for
additional results to be presented. A fig-
ure may be warranted.
4) Also crucial is what we may call
"the changes in BMI-POPs relationship."
Could the authors please comment on the
possible influence upon BMI measure-
ments of the cross-sectional design of the
study? Could they suggest possible con-
sequences upon findings of weight gain
and weight loss in diabetic and nondia-
betic participants?
5) High-prevalence ORs were found
for the summary or composite of the six
POPs with the highest concentrations.
Are the results similar if the joint effects of
multiple POPs are assessed through alter-
native methods?
6) Finally, the authors state that "re-
verse causality is unlikely." Indeed, evi-
dence supporting the hypothesis that
diabetes increases accumulation of POPs
seems scarce (4). Do the authors know of
studies on the toxicokinetics of POPs in
diabetic subjects demonstrating that they
accumulate POPs more than nondiabetic
subjects?
