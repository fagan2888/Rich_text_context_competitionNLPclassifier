OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of overweight among different ethnic and gender groups of children and
adolescents in the San Antonio, Texas, area and to compare the prevalence with that of the US national ®gures.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study
SUBJECTS: A total of 7208 schoolchildren in kindergarten through 12th grade. There were 4215 Mexican American (MA)
(58.5%), 2040 non-Hispanic white (NHW) (28.3%) and 953 African American (AA) (13.2%) subjects.
MEASUREMENTS: Weight, height and skinfold thicknesses.
RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI, kgam2) values of MA boys were almost consistently and signi®cantly (P ` 0.05) larger than
NHW boys and showed a tendency to be larger than AA boys, beginning as early as age 6 and continuing through age 17.
Although rarely signi®cant, a similar trend in ethnic difference was also noted for girls, with the smallest BMI seen in NHW girls.
The subscapular skinfold thickness (SST) for MA boys and girls was signi®cantly (P ` 0.05) larger than that for NHW counterparts
and showed a tendency to be larger than AA counterparts. No signi®cant ethnic differences were present in the triceps skinfold
thickness (TST) for girls, but MA boys' TST were occasionally larger (P ` 0.05) than other ethnic-gender groups. Girls' TST were
frequently larger (P ` 0.05) than boys for each ethnic groups. Using the population data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) I as reference, the prevalence of overweight (BMI ! 95th percentile) was greater in MA (15 ±
28%) and AA (11 ± 29%) boys and girls than in NHW (7 ± 17%) counterparts. The combined prevalence of overweight and `at
risk of overweight' (BMI b 85th percentile) was much larger in MA boys (40 ± 50%), MA girls (34 ± 52%), and AA girls (33 ± 51%)
than other subgroups. The onset of overweight is quite early, starting at 5 ± 6 y of age, especially in girls. Compared to the data
from national surveys, the prevalence of overweight found in this study is higher than reported nationally. We found a marked
increase in the skinfold thickness, especially SST for boys, but the increase is less for girls.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight is higher in MA boys and girls and AA girls than other ethnic-gender groups in
the San Antonio, Texas, area. The prevalence of childhood overweight in the San Antonio area is higher than national ®gures.
The ®ndings of increasing prevalence and early onset of childhood overweight are concerning, because these are known risk
factors for diabetes and diseases of many other organ systems. Measures to prevent, reduce or treat childhood obesity are
urgently needed.

Introduction
The increasing prevalence of obesity in the last two decades
in adults1,2 as well as children and adolescents3 ± 6 is a
national concern. Although ethnic differences exist, the
increase in the prevalence of overweight is seen across
ethnic and gender groups.2,4 ± 7 Obesity is more prevalent in
Mexican American (MA) and African American (AA)
adults1,8 ± 10 and children5,8,11,12 than non-Hispanic white
(NHW) counterpart. Ethnic differences are also found with
fat patterning. Central (truncal) fat distribution is strongly

as other cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in adults2,13,14 and
children.15 ± 17 This pattern of fat distribution is more pre-
valent in AA and MA adults and children relative to
NHW.18,19
Because blood pressure levels are known to be correlated
with body size,20,21 anthropometric measurements were part
of the San Antonio Children's Blood Pressure Study, which
was conducted in children kindergarten through 12th grade
from the San Antonio, Texas, area, during the periods of
1991 ± 1995 and 1996 ± 1998. Although the national trends
of ethnic differences in the prevalence of obesity are known,
the same information is lacking for this region in which
Mexican Americans are the majority. The purposes of this
portion of the report were (1) to examine the prevalence of
overweight for each ethnic and gender group in a triethnic
pediatric population, (2) to examine whether ethnic differ-
ences seen in adults are present in children, and (3) to
compare the prevalence of obesity in this region with that
of national surveys.
Methods
(A) Subject population and recruitment
This study was carried out in school children enrolled in
kindergarten through 12th grade, in three selected school
districts in the San Antonio, Texas, area. The initial phase of
the San Antonio Children's Blood Pressure Study began in
the fall of 1991 as a 4-y study (until 1995) to collect data
from a biethnic population of MA and NHW children and
adolescents. This phase of the study involved the South San
Antonio Independent School District (ISD) and the Schertz-
Cibolo-Universal City ISD. For a triethnic comparison, the
study was extended in 1996 (to 1998) to include the San
Antonio ISD to collect data primarily from African American
(AA) children. The Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD is a
suburb of San Antonio with the majority of its students being
non-Hispanic white (66.0%). The student body of the South
San Antonio ISD is mostly Mexican American (94.0%). All
schools in these two ISD were studied. There were four
elementary schools, two middle schools, and one high
school in the Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD and 10
elementary schools, three middle schools, and two high
schools in the South San Antonio ISD. Only three elemen-
tary schools, two middle schools and one high school were
selected from the San Antonio ISD to recruit primarily
African American children. Although the socioeconomic
status was not clearly evaluated, participation in the school
lunch program is an indicator of the socioeconomic status.
Free school lunch program participation in each school
district was as follows: (1) South San Antonio ISD Ð 95%;
(2) Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD Ð 25.9%; and (3) San
Antonio ISD Ð 100%.
The School Boards of the three ISDs agreed to allow data
collection in their schools. Parental consent was obtained
and the child was also asked for hisaher assent before data
were collected. The letter and the consent forms were in
English and Spanish. The Institutional Review Board of the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio
approved the research protocol.
Ethnic classi®cation for African American (AA) children
was made by the staff observer. The classi®cation of Mexican
American (MA), non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Mexican
Hispanics, and others was based on a previously published
algorithm because MAs have different genetic makeup from
other Hispanics.22 Scoring of the algorithm was done by
computer so that the actual classi®cation of children as
MA, NHW or other was independent of observers' judgment.
Weight and height were measured to calculate BMI.
Weight was measured with a scale calibrated daily with
standard weights. Weight without shoes or heavy garments
was measured to the nearest 0.25 pound and converted to kg
later. Height without shoes was measured with the child
standing straight against a 3 m rule taped to the wall and
squared at the base with the ¯oor. With the child looking
straight ahead at an indicated point on the opposite wall,
and heels, buttocks and occiput touching the wall, the edge
of a plastic right triangle was positioned perpendicular to the
meter rule to be touching the top of the head, with hair
pushed down. The height was measured to the nearest
0.1 cm.
Triceps skinfold thickness was measured over the back of
the right upper arm at the midpoint with the arm pendant. A
full thickness pinch of skin was grasped horizontally 1 cm
above the midpoint, and the skinfold thickness was read
immediately after applying Lange calipers (square tipped).
The calipers were released and the measurement recorded to
the nearest 1 mm. Subscapular skinfold thickness was mea-
sured by pinching a full thickness of skin below the caudal
end of the right scapula in the back, using the Lange calipers
in the same manner as above. The Lange calipers were
checked monthly for tension and measurement accuracy.
Data so collected were entered into a database. Statistical
analyses were performed using the SAS Software (SAS Insti-
tute Inc., Cary, NC) by the Computing Resources Department
of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio, Texas. Children whose ethnic group was other
then AA, MA and NHW were excluded from the statistical
analyses, although they were included in data collection as
required by the school districts. The remaining children were
divided into six subgroups by ethnicity and gender. The mean
and standard deviation (s.d.) of BMI and skinfold thicknesses
were computed for each ethnic-gender group. Statistical tests
for signi®cant ethnic and gender differences in these vari-
ables were performed by Analysis of Variance followed by the
Bonferroni test for each age group (age at last birthday in
years). Statistical signi®cance was accepted at the 5% level in
this study. The prevalence of overweight in this population
was computed using the reference data of BMI from the
NHANES I.23,24 BMI and skinfold thickness data from this
study were compared with the results of national surveys.

Results
Data from 1006 subjects were excluded from analyses
because of ethnicity or race other than AA, MA and NHW
(n  612), ages older than 17 y (n  299), and incomplete data
(n  95). Data from a total of 7208 children ranging in age
from 5 to 17 y are included in the statistical analysis (Table
1). The number of MA children was much larger (58.5%)
than that of NHW (28.3%) and AA (13.2%) children. The
over-sampling of MA children could not be avoided because
the school district policy required that every child who
wanted to participate be screened. Despite our best efforts,
a disproportionately small number of AA children partici-
pated in the study. The participation rate was 74% for the
Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD, 66% for the South San
Antonio ISD, and 49% for the selected schools in the San
Antonio ISD.
Body mass index
The BMI values of MA girls were almost always signi®cantly
(P ` 0.05) larger than those of NHW girls (Table 2). The BMI
values of MA and AA girls were not signi®cantly different.
MA boys had consistently and signi®cantly (P ` 0.05) larger
BMI values than did NHW boys throughout the ages studied
(Table 2). MA boys showed a strong tendency to have larger
BMI values than AA boys, with statistical signi®cance
attained frequently. No signi®cant gender difference was
found for BMI (Table 2). Overall, the BMI values of NHW
girls were the smallest and those of MA boys the largest.
Skinfold thicknesses
The subscapular skinfold thickness (SST) values of MA girls
and boys were almost consistently and signi®cantly
(P ` 0.05) larger than those of NHW counterparts and
showed a tendency to be larger than those of AA boys and
girls (Table 3). One exception to this was the SST value of AA
girls ages 15 ± 17 y which was signi®cantly larger (P ` 0.05)
than that of MA and NHW girls. With regards to the triceps
skinfold thickness (TST), no signi®cant ethnic differences
were present for girls, although MA girls tended to have

the larger values than other ethnic groups (Table 4). MA boys
had the largest TST, with occasional statistical signi®cance
attained. The TST of girls were often signi®cantly (P ` 0.05)
larger than those of boys in all three ethnic groups (Table 4).
Prevalence of overweight by BMI
Figures 1 and 2 show the prevalence of overweight in the
triethnic pediatric population of the San Antonio, Texas,
area compared with the age- and gender-speci®c 85th and
95th percentile cut-off points of the NHANES I population
data.23,24 Overweight in children and adolescents is de®ned
as those with BMI values at or greater than the 95th percen-
tile of the reference value.25 Those children whose BMI is
between the 85th percentile and the 94th percentile are
de®ned as `at risk of overweight'.25 By this de®nition, the
expected prevalence of overweight in a reference population
should be 5% and that of `at risk' should be 10%.
For girls, the combined prevalence of overweight and `at
risk' is much higher in AA and MA girls than NHW girls
(Figure 1). The combined prevalence ranges between 33%
and 51% for AA girls, between 34% and 52% for MA girls,
and between 22% and 38% for NHW girls. The prevalence of
overweight (BMI b 95th percentile) is much lower in NHW
girls (8 ± 17%) than the other ethnic groups (15 ± 29% for AA
girls and 15 ± 27% for MA girls). The prevalence of `at risk of
overweight' in NHW adolescent girls (13 ± 22%) tends to be
lower than that in the other ethnic groups (Figure 1). An
early onset of marked overweight occurring in AA and MA
girls at ages 5 and 6 is noteworthy.

For boys, the combined prevalence of overweight and `at
risk' is highest in MA boys (40 ± 50%), with almost half of
adolescents having BMI values greater than 85th percentile
of the reference value.23,24 The combined prevalence is lower
for AA boys (23 ± 36%) and NHW boys (22 ± 37%) (Figure 2).
Note that the onset of overweight is quite early in boys as
well as in girls. MA boys have the highest prevalence of
overweight (BMI b 95th percentile) with the ranges between
21 and 28%. Among boys, the lowest prevalence of over-
weight is seen in NHW subjects (range of 7 ± 16%). For AA
boys, the prevalence of overweight ranges between 11 and
27%. The overall prevalence of `at risk' ranges between 7%
and 26% (Figure 2). AA boys had a lower prevalence of `at
risk' than the other ethnic groups.
Comparisons with national ®gures
In Table 5, the prevalence reported by Troiano et al5 and that
found in this study are compared. For both studies, the
reference values used (National Health Examination Survey
(HES) cycles II and III) and the age breakdown are the same.
The prevalence of overweight and `at risk of overweight' in
this study is much higher than that reported by Troiano et al5
from NHANES III. In all, 35 ± 47% of MA boys and girls and
AA girls have BMI greater than the 85th percentile in this
study, in comparison to the ®gures reported by Troiano et al
from the NHANES III (between 20 and 33%).5 The difference
in the prevalence between these two studies is striking. The
percentage difference in the prevalence of BMI b 85th per-
centile (the combined prevalence of overweight and `at risk')
is on average 134%, with a high of 180%. The percentage
difference for the prevalence of overweight (BMI b 95th
percentile) is on average 148%, with a high of more than
200% (Table 5).
Changes in skinfold thicknesses
The mean values of the SST in this study were compared with
the race-speci®c 50th percentile values from NHANES I data
for AA and NHW boys26 and AA and NHW girls.27 The
reference values for MA children were from the Hispanic
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES),28 since
the ethnicity-speci®c MA data are not available from
NHANES I. The increase in the SST was modest in girls of
6 ± 11 y and less in older girls (Table 6). There was almost no
increase in the SST in NHW girls aged 12 ± 17 y. AA and MA
girls showed much larger percentage increases than NHW
girls. The SST was markedly increased in boys of all ages, with
a larger increase seen in AA and MA boys than in NHW boys
(Table 6). The largest increase (70 ± 128%) is seen in AA boys.
In comparison with 50th percentile values for TST from
NHANES I (1971 ± 1974) for AA and NHW children26 and
from HHANES (1982 ± 1984),28 for MA children, there was a
small percentage increase in the TST in girls 6 ± 11 y for all
ethnic groups. However, for MA and NHW girls aged 12 ± 17,
there was an actual percentage decrease (13 ± 20%) in this
measurement. In AA adolescent girls the value increased (not
shown). For boys, there was a modest increase (9 ± 48%) in
the percentage change in all ages studied. The increase was
most marked in AA boys and least so in NHW boys.
Discussion
Our data show (a) that an increase in the prevalence of
overweight is seen in all ethnic and gender groups, as has
been reported nationally,6,12 (b) that there are several impor-
tant ethnic differences in BMI and skinfold thickness mea-
surements in children and adolescents, and (c) that the
magnitude of the increase in the prevalence is greater in
this study than has been reported nationally.
MA boys and girls often have larger BMI values than NHW
counterparts while AA children, especially girls, have BMI
values equally as large as MA girls. Data from NHANES II,29
NHANES III,6 and HHANES28 show the same ethnic differ-
ences in BMI as noted above among the three ethnic groups
of children. These three national surveys28 ± 30 also show the
same pattern of ethnic differences in BMI among the three
ethnic groups of adults. With regard to the SST, MA children
tended to have larger values than other ethnic groups and

NHW girls had the smallest SST measurements. NHANES II29
and HHANES28 surveys also showed the same pattern of
ethnic differences in the SST in adults as found in this
study, with white women having the lowest SST. Thus, the
results of our study show that the ethnic differences in BMI
and the fat distribution pattern reported in the adult are
already established as early as 5 ± 6 y of age.
There has been a dramatic (8%) increase in the prevalence
of overweight in the last two decades, more precisely
between the period of 1976 ± 1980 (NHANES II) and 1988 ±
1991 (NHANES III, phase I).1 Flegal et al30 reported the
prevalence of obesity (de®ned as body mass index (BMI,
kgam2) ! 30) to be 22% of men and 24.9% of women in
the NHANES III (1988 ± 1994). The prevalence was higher in
Mexican American (MA) men (25.4%) than white (20%) and
African American (AA) (21.3%) men and it was higher in MA
women (34.2%) and AA women (30%) than white women
(22%). Parallel with the increase in prevalence of obesity in
adults,1 an alarming increase in the prevalence of childhood
obesity has occurred during the same period in the USA.3,4,6
Troiano et al,5 reported the prevalence of obesity (called
overweight in pediatrics, BMI ! 95th percentile) from the
NHANES III study (1988 ± 1994) to be 10 ± 12% for NHW
and AA boys and 15 ± 17% for MA boys. It was 14 ± 16% for
AA and MA girls and 9% for white girls,6 showing the same
ethnic trend as reported in the adults.30 Thus, the trends in
ethnic difference are the same for adults and children in the
NHANES III5,30 and in our triethnic pediatric population in
the San Antonio area.
This rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity is con-
cerning because many obese children become obese
adults31,32 and, once established, obesity is dif®cult to
treat. It becomes a chronic condition with complications of
many organ systems,2 including cardiovascular diseases, type
2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep
apnea, and certain types of cancer.2,33,34 None of the treat-
ment modalities available will cure the condition.33 At best,
the condition is palliated on continued treatment at an
enormous cost. In 1995, the total cost attributable to obesity
amounted to $99.2 billion.35 Approximately $51.6 billion of
these dollars (5.7% of the national health expenditure) were
direct medical costs.35
Unlike adults, obesity-related diseases are rarely mani-
fested in children and adolescents. However, some of these
children have already shown signs of chronic complications
of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, usually not seen until
middle age.36 Many of these children may actually have high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other diseases in their
early stages,17,37 ± 39 and are at risk for psychosocial dysfunc-
tion.40 Many diseases, including coronary artery disease, are
silent during childhood and adolescence, but there is strong
evidence that coronary artery `clogging' is going on during
childhood.41 The early onset of overweight seen in this study
is also concerning. The onset of overweight may be even
earlier in the preschool-age group, which we did not study.
Reports from the US42 and the UK43 indicate that some
preschool children are already obese. Hernandez et al42
reported 32% of children in a Head Start program to be
overweight. Reilly et al43 reported that 20% of 4-y-old chil-
dren in the UK were overweight. Therefore, the prevention
andaor remediation of obesity is an important measure that
could prevent cardiovascular diseases, hypertension32 dia-
betes36 and other diseases in youth and thus should be
started in childhood.41,44 Interventions during childhood
are more likely to have long-term success.44
The reasons for the higher prevalence of overweight in
this area are not entirely clear. It may be a local phenom-
enon, as San Antonio is dubiously known as the third
`fattest' city in the country.45 It may also re¯ect a continued
increase in the prevalence of overweight since the comple-
tion of the NHANES III (1991 ± 1994), but this is unlikely at
least for MA and NHW children because our data collection
was only 1 y later than the national survey. Most of the data
on AA children were, however, obtained 4 ± 5 y later (in 1996
to 1998) than the NHANES III and may re¯ect the continued
increase in obesity rather than the local phenomenon. Thus,
the reasons for the higher prevalence of obesity in this region
may be a combination of the two possibilities.
The strength of this study is that it was carried out in a
triethnic population by a small number of investigators, so
that a direct comparison of anthropometric data is possible
among the three ethnic groups. The weaknesses of the study
includes (a) a disproportionately small number of AA chil-
dren participated and an over-sampling of MA children
(59%) was unavoidable because of the required policy of
School Districts to collect data from all volunteering stu-
dents, (b) the participation rate was less than optimal, (c)
data collection from predominantly AA students lagged 2 y,
(d) detailed information on the socioeconomic status or the
level of acculturation are lacking, and (e) no information is
available on the difference between participants and non-
participants. Small numbers of AA subjects in the study may
have resulted in a less than ideal situation for statistical
analyses for this particular ethnic group. The socioeconomic
and acculturation status would undoubtedly have contribu-
ted to the ethnic difference shown in this study.46 ± 48 The
prevalence of obesity and its ethnic differences obtained in
this study may not be appropriate for other regions.
In conclusion, we found in this study an early onset of
childhood obesity and an early establishment of the adult
pattern of ethnic differences in BMI and central fat distribu-
tion. The reports of childhood onset of type 2 diabetes36 and
cardiovascular risk factors17,49 are particular concerns. The
prevention andaor remediation of overweight is an impor-
tant measure that could prevent hypertension,32,50 dia-
betes,36 and other diseases in young adults and these
efforts should be started in childhood.41
