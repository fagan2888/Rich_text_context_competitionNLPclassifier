Abstract
Background: Excess mortality due to seasonal influenza is thought to be substantial. However,
influenza may often not be recognized as cause of death. Imputation methods are therefore
required to assess the public health impact of influenza. The purpose of this study was to obtain
estimates of monthly excess mortality due to influenza that are based on an epidemiologically
meaningful model.
Methods and Results: U.S. monthly all-cause mortality, 1995 through 2005, was hierarchically
modeled as Poisson variable with a mean that linearly depends both on seasonal covariates and on
influenza-certified mortality. It also allowed for overdispersion to account for extra variation that
is not captured by the Poisson error. The coefficient associated with influenza-certified mortality
was interpreted as ratio of total influenza mortality to influenza-certified mortality. Separate
models were fitted for four age categories (<18, 18­49, 50­64, 65+). Bayesian parameter
estimation was performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. For the eleven year study
period, a total of 260,814 (95% CI: 201,011­290,556) deaths was attributed to influenza,
corresponding to an annual average of 23,710, or 0.91% of all deaths.
Conclusion: Annual estimates for influenza mortality were highly variable from year to year, but
they were systematically lower than previously published estimates. The excellent fit of our model
with the data suggest validity of our estimates.
Background
Influenza viruses, due to their genotypic plasticity [1],
cause yearly epidemics that generally coincide with peaks
in all-cause mortality (Figure 1). Incidence of these infec-
tions is difficult to quantify because of their clinical simi-
larity with other upper respiratory infections and because
laboratory confirmation is rarely done. Mortality due to
seasonal influenza, which may result from exacerbation of
underlying pulmonary, cardiac or other systemic condi-
tions is, nevertheless, thought to be substantial [2-17].
Recent U.S. estimates of average annual excess mortality
due to seasonal influenza exceed 30,000 [11,14].
To estimate excess mortality due to influenza, two funda-
mental approaches have previously been used. The most
popular one is based on Serfling's seasonal regression
method [18] and has resulted in numerous estimates of
excess mortality due influenza [3-8,12,14,15,19]. This
periodical regression approach is based on parametric
estimation of a sinusoidal "baseline" function that repre-

sents mortality in absence of influenza. The difference
between the baseline function and the observed numbers
of deaths is then interpreted as the number of excess
deaths due to influenza. Typically, the baseline mortality
function is fitted to weekly or monthly mortality rates or
numbers during non-influenza months, using two or
more Fourier terms [18]. This approach is intuitively
appealing as it captures the strong seasonal periodicity of
mortality. However, the particular choice of a parametric
baseline function lacks epidemiological justification: Why
should the baseline function be sinusoidal rather than of
any other periodic form? Depending on the shape of the
"true" baseline function, under- or overestimation of
excess mortality due to influenza might result. If, for
example, the true baseline function is "higher" (i.e. the
definite integral of the true function is larger) than the
assumed sinusoidal function, then overestimation would
result and vice versa. Another, potentially more important
shortcoming of the periodical regression approach lies in
the fact that seasonally correlated causes of mortality,
including influenza, are not controlled for, which might
lead to confounded estimates of excess mortality.
To avoid this difficulty, one could gauge all-cause mortal-
ity with some independent measure of influenza trans-
mission (or mortality). Following this rationale,
Thompson et al. [11] estimated excess mortality due to
both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). They
used a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poisson
distribution and a logarithmic link function to model the
weekly number of deaths. They also used two Fourier
terms in their model, but, in addition, used indicators of
influenza and RSV transmission. These indicator variables
were defined by the proportions of specimens testing pos-
itive for influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), influ-
enza B and RSV. Several potential shortcomings of this
methods are, however, apparent. First, this model also
makes a priori assumptions about the baseline mortality
function­in this case an exponentiated sinusoidal func-
tion. Although this might conceivably be true, there is lit-

tle empirical evidence to support this assumption.
Second, the multiplicative form of the model implies that
excess mortality, given a certain amount of influenza
activity, depends on the current level of all-cause mortal-
ity. Again, this does not appear to be a well-founded
assumption. Finally, the proportion of test positive speci-
mens is likely to be a poor measure of excess mortality.
While a high proportion of test positive specimens is com-
patible with high levels of influenza transmission (and
excess mortality), this is not necessarily true. The model,
however, implies that five hundred influenza positives,
obtained from a thousand tests, are associated with less
excess mortality than two influenza positives, obtained
from three tests. This appears to be an unrealistic assump-
tion. The seasonally changing frequency of influenza test-
ing [20] is, at least partly, due to the seasonally changing
incidence of other agents causing influenza-like illness
(ILL).
Alternatively, one could postulate that mortality directly
attributed to influenza (influenza-certified mortality) rep-
resents a certain proportion of all mortality attributable to
influenza. This assumption implies that the coefficient
associated with influenza-certified mortality represents
the ratio of total influenza mortality to influenza certified
mortality [17,21]. Here we use a method for the estima-
tion of influenza excess mortality which is similar to the
one recently presented by Schanzer and colleagues [17]:
we adopt the proportionality assumption and avoid spe-
cific parametric assumptions about the baseline function.
In addition, and deviating from the Schanzer model, we
allow for random variability of influenza-certified mortal-
ity by adopting a hierarchical modeling approach. We
present the resulting estimates of U.S. excess mortality due
to influenza for the years 1995 to 2005. We compare these
to estimates obtained from a Thompson-like model [11],
as well as to previously published estimates of influenza-
associated excess mortality.
Methods
Data
We used Multiple Cause-of-Death Data for the years 1995
to 2005 (Multiple Cause-of-Death Microdata, 1995­
2005, National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville,
Maryland). This dataset is in the public domain and can
be electronically downloaded from the web site of the
National Bureau of Economic Research
http:www.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-mortalitdatmulti
ple-cause-of-death.html. We defined deaths as influenza-
certified if influenza was given as underlying cause of
death. The corresponding diagnostic code for ICD-9
(1995 to 1998) was 487 and and for ICD-10 (1999
onwards) the code range was J10­J12. Influenza years
were defined as lasting from July 1 of one year to June 30
of the following year. We defined four age categories: < 18,
18­49, 50­64 and 65+. Observations with missing age (N
= 4,490) were not included in this analysis.
Statistical model
The epidemiological model on which our analyses are
based implies that monthly all-cause mortality is the sum
of "baseline mortality", i.e. mortality that is independent
of influenza, and mortality that is a direct or indirect result
of influenza. Based on the pronounced seasonal periodic-
ity of all-cause mortality we assume that baseline mortal-
ity is a function of calender month. In addition, we allow
for a linear and/or non-linear trend in all-cause mortality
that takes into account demographic or other population
level changes resulting in linear/non-linear changes in
baseline mortality over time. Finally, we accommodate
extra variability of baseline mortality that is not accounted
for by calender month and trend. This epidemiological
model corresponds to the following statistical model,
hence referred to as "current model":

where Yi
is the observed all-cause mortality count during
index months i = 1, ..., 132. The variable Yi
which repre-
sents a number and not a rate, is assumed to follow a Pois-
son distribution with a mean parameter 
i
. The Poisson
mean parameter 
i
has an identity link and is distributed
as Normal with mean 
i
and variance . This parametriza-
tion for the Poisson mean 
i
allows for overdispersion. In
the implementation, 
i
is restricted to positive values to
ensure the positivity of the generated samples. The model
for 
i
has two parts. The first part concerns mortality due
to non-influenza related causes (baseline mortality)
which includes a random intercept for calendar
month mi
(mi
= 1, ..., 12) that models the seasonal back-
ground mortality, and also includes linear, quadratic and
cubic effects for temporal changes due to health, demo-
graphic or socioeconomic factors. The variable ti

year 1995. The regression coefficients

To assess the performance of the current model, we also

cator for total influenza mortality. For this Thompson-like

Statistical analysis
The parameters for this hierarchical model were estimated
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
implemented in WinBUGS, version 1.4.1 (Imperial Col-
lege and Medical Research Council, UK) [22]. Uninforma-
tive prior distributions were used (additional file 1). To
ensure positivity of all 
i
, the normal priors of this param-
eter were truncated at non-positive values (additional file
1). The empirical posterior distributions of the parameters
were obtained from MCMC samples of 30,000, resulting
from three chains with 200,000 burn-in iterations and
10,000 samples each. Posterior means and 95% credible
intervals (CIs) were calculated for all parameters of inter-
est after ensuring convergence of all model parameters.
The parameters of the TL model could easily be estimated
using a GLM procedure in any standard statistical software
package. However, to allow for direct comparison of the
model fit we used the same estimation procedure as for
the current model. The fit of the two age-specific models
was compared using the deviance information criterion
(DIC) [23]. DIC penalizes the model goodness-of-fit for
additional complexity. The complexity is measured by the
effective number of parameters.
In order to quantify the variance explained by the fitted
models, we used a Bayesian version of the classical R-
squared [24]. i.e.
where E(·) and V(·) are the operators for the posterior
mean and empirical variance, respectively and ei

The empirical variance of e is computed for each iteration.
Separate analyses were performed for the four age catego-
ries, because of substantial differences in seasonality of
all-cause mortality: While seasonal periodicity is quite
obvious in the oldest category, it distinctly decreases with
age and becomes inapparent in the youngest category
(Figure 2).
Results
A total of 26,262,147 deaths over the period of eleven
years were included in this analysis. Of these deaths,
12,922 (0.05%) were influenza-certified. The current
model (1­4) fit the data very well (Figure 3a) and
explained most of the variance of all-cause mortality

(BRSQ for age categories < 18, 18­49, 50­64 and 65+:
0.90, 0.93, 0.97 and 0.96, respectively).
The estimated ratio of influenza-certified deaths to all
deaths attributable to influenza was less than three and a
half in those younger than 18, over twenty for 50+ and
intermediate in the age category 18­49 (Table 1). Overall,
we estimated that 260,814 (95% CI: 201,011­290,556)
deaths were attributable to influenza over the whole study
period. This corresponds to an annual average of 23,710
excess deaths. Most of these deaths (90.93%; 95% CI:
87.13%­93.67%) occurred in people 65 or older. Far less
represented were those between 50 and 64 at time of
death (6.61%; 95% CI: 4.56%­8.90%). The two lowest
age categories contributed together less than three percent
(< 18: 0.83%; 95% CI: 0.40%, 1.31% and 18­49: 1.45%;
95% CI: 0.21%­4.85%) to estimated influenza mortality.
Table 2 shows the estimated number of deaths due to
influenza for full influenza years, according to the current
model. The numbers varied widely from year to year. By
far the largest number of seasonal deaths due to influenza
was observed for 2003/04, with close to 47,000 deaths.
The lowest numbers, which only little exceeded one tenth
of that, were seen for the years 2000/01 and 2002/03.
The TL model resulted in 302,665 (95% CI: 294,192­
311,200) estimated excess deaths due to influenza, which
is 16% higher than our overall estimate (additional file 1).
The fit of this model, according to the DIC, was slightly
better than the current model for the youngest age cate-
gory (Table 3), that exhibited little seasonal variation in
all-cause mortality. For all other age categories, particu-
larly the oldest one, the fit of the TL model, compared to
the current model, was distinctly inferior (Table 3). The fit

of the age group-specific TL models combined was worse
than the corresponding fit of the current model (Figures
3a and 3b). Accordingly, the variance explained by the TL
model was also lower than for our model (BRSQ for age
categories < 18, 18­49, 50­64 and 65+: 0.61, 0.31, 0.84
and 0.83, respectively). Yet, the pattern of predicted total
influenza deaths was virtually identical to the one pre-
dicted by the current model (Figure 4).
Discussion
Our estimates of excess mortality due to influenza are sub-
stantial, especially for the influenza years 1997/98, 1999/
2000 and 2003/04, during which influenza A(H3N2) pre-
dominated. The lowest estimates were obtained for the
years 2000/01 and 2002/03, when influenza A(H1N1)
and B viruses predominated. Nevertheless, our estimates
are markedly lower than previous estimates. For the year
1995/96, for example, we attributed 12,067 excess deaths
to influenza. For the same period, Simonsen et al. [14]
estimated that 25,071 deaths were attributable to influ-
enza in ages 65+ alone. Thompson et al. [11] estimated
the number of excess deaths during that influenza year at
36,280­more than three times our estimate. The obvious
question arises, which of these estimates are closest to the
true excess mortality? As pointed out above, the method
of Simonsen et al. [14] is problematic for two reasons.
First, it does not account for temporal correlation between
baseline mortality and influenza excess mortality. The
resulting estimates of influenza excess mortality may
therefore be confounded. Second, their model makes a
priori assumptions about the parametric shape of the base-
line function; these assumptions may or may not be true.
They should, in any event, be validated. The Thompson
model [11], which superficially resembles a hybrid
between the Simonsen model and the model proposed by
Schanzer et al. [17] (or the current model), addresses the
issue of temporal confounding by controlling for the pro-
portion of influenza test positives. As pointed out in the
Background section, the use of that specific variable to
control for influenza mortality may not be appropriate.
We compared estimates from the TL model with estimates
from the current model. The TL model is based on the
Thompson model, but influenza-certified mortality is
substituted for proportion positives. Although the result-
ing estimates were about a sixth higher than our estimates,
the seasonal pattern was highly consistent with the pat-
tern seen with the current model. This consistency implies
relative robustness of excess deaths estimates to the choice
of a specific baseline function. The vast difference between
our and Thompson's estimates [11] can therefore not be
explained by differences in model structure, nor in the
way the baseline function is modeled. They may rather be
due to the use of proportion of specimens testing positive
to control for influenza mortality.
Schanzer et al. [17], like us, used a Poisson model with
linear (rather than logarithmic) link function, to analyze
weekly mortality data from Canada. Modeling weekly
mortality has the advantage of giving higher temporal res-
olution to the analysis. On the other hand, deaths associ-
ated with, but not attributed to influenza may occur with
some delay and may thus be partially decoupled from
influenza-certified mortality. However, Schanzer and col-
leagues did not find an obvious lag between weekly influ-
enza-certified mortality and mortality due to other causes.
Future studies will be needed to determine what level of
temporal aggregation results in the best estimates.
To take into account random variability in influenza-cer-
tified mortality, we used a hierarchical model. While the
point estimates for  (corresponding to 
3
in [17])
obtained from a GLM are very similar to the ones
obtained from the hierarchical model (21.35 and 21.16,
respectively, for 65+), the confidence limits are much

wider for the latter (95% credible interval 18.06, 24.32 vs.
Wald 95% confidence interval 20.91, 21.80). This may
even be more pronounced for weekly data, where num-
bers of influenza-certified deaths are often quite small. To
the extent that our hierarchical model takes into account
random variability of influenza-certified deaths and thus
leads to wider confidence limits around the resulting
excess mortality estimates, it is more conservative than
non-hierarchical GLM models.
The potentially most serious shortcoming of our
approach to influenza excess mortality estimation relates
to the possibility that influenza-certified mortality is a
poor indicator of total influenza mortality. Although a
death certificate diagnosis of influenza will likely only be
given under strong suspicion of that cause, the diagnosis
will rarely have been laboratory-confirmed and therefore
is likely of low specificity. As this indicator explains mor-
tality in excess of the seasonal baseline very well one could
speculate that a better indicator of influenza mortality
would lead to even lower estimates of influenza excess
mortality. A preliminary comparison of the number of
influenza A(H3N2) isolates with influenza-certified death
for two influenza seasons (2002/03 and 2003/04)
revealed a remarkably close correspondence of the two
indicators (Figure 5). Could it be that the number of influ-
enza isolates informs the death certificate diagnosis? The
cross-validation of various indicators for influenza mor-
tality will be an important target of future research. The
very high proportion of all-cause mortality explained by
our model makes it appear quite unlikely that a substan-
tially better model of all-cause mortality can be con-
structed. We therefore believe that our estimates of excess
mortality are better than previous estimates, which are
invariably larger than ours. Future studies of excess mor-
tality due to influenza should also consider the possibility

that the relationship between the chosen influenza indica-
tor and total influenza excess mortality might change
from season to season or even over the season. Studies
examining the public health impact of influenza should
address some additional issues. First, mortality may not
be a good measure of the burden a disease inflicts upon a
population. It may be that most deaths that are triggered
by an influenza infection occur in people on the verge of
dying from other causes, so that the time of death is
advanced only by a short period of time. Clearly, the bur-
den of disease would be much lighter in that case than if
most people were to die from influenza prematurely by
many years. A more adequate measure of disease burden
therefore may be disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
[25]. By estimating a more refined age distribution of
those who died from influenza, calculations of DALYs, or
at least of potential years of life lost (PYLL), should be rel-
atively straightforward. As persons with underlying ill-
nesses are particularly vulnerable to fatal influenza
infection, and also might have reduced life expectancy at
the time of death, resulting PYLL estimates might be
inflated. Second, by modeling monthly mortality inde-
pendent of mortality during previous periods we ignore,
like others, the demographic process that may lead to
reduced mortality after epidemic mortality: Not only will
lower mortality result from the depletion of the popula-
tion at risk (smaller denominator), but influenza is also
likely to disproportionately affect the frailest individuals,
thus leaving the remaining population less frail and thus
less susceptible. The first part of this problem could be

remedied by modeling the mortality rates rather than
numbers of deaths. The second one could be addressed by
making specific assumptions on the frailty distribution in
the population and on the association between that frailty
characteristic and relative mortality risk.
Conclusion
Previous estimates of excess mortality due to influenza
may be biased and inflated. We propose a two-level hier-
archical Poisson model where the baseline mortality var-
ies with time. The goodness-of-fit statistic indicates that
this model fits the data very well, explaining well above
90% of the observed variation of all-cause mortality dur-
ing the eleven years study period. The resulting estimates
are therefore likely of high validity. Future attempts to
quantify the public health burden of influenza should
also explore demographic approaches that take into
account life expectancy.
