Background and objectives: Obesity has been associated with kidney disease in adults. This study was designed to evaluate
the association of obesity with an early marker of kidney disease, albuminuria, among young adults.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Urinalysis (n  9371), albumin-to-creatinine ratio (n  4463), and body mass
index (kg/m2) were measured in the Add Health Wave III cohort (2001 to 2002), a multiethnic sample of young adults followed
for approximately 6 yr. Multivariate logistic regression modeled the association of sex-specific albuminuria with body mass
index, adjusted for sample weights, sex, race, ethnicity, and glycosuria.
Results: Urinalysis revealed that 0.8% had proteinuria, 4.6% had hematuria, 0.2% had combined hematuria and proteinuria,
and 1.5% had glycosuria. Albuminuria prevalence was 4.4%. Mean body mass index was higher among those with albuminuria
compared with those without. There were no associations between body mass index categories of 25 to <30 or 30 to <35 kg/m2
with albuminuria compared with the lowest body mass index (<25 kg/m2); however, the highest category (>35 kg/m2) was
associated with albuminuria, compared with the lowest category (OR  1.76, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.04). Glycosuria (OR  4.0; 95%
CI: 1.5 to 11.1, p < 0.01) as well as increasing body mass index during the 6-yr follow-up (OR: 1.07 per unit change in kg/m2;
95% CI: 1.00 to 1.13, p  0.04) were also associated with albuminuria.
Conclusions: Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, the association of albuminuria associated with obesity in young
adults is particularly concerning. Obesity may be a target for primary prevention of kidney and cardiovascular disease.

More than 60% of adults who live in the United States
are overweight (1). Overweight is associated with in-
creasing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipi-
demia (2). This constellation of risk factors is also associated with
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the prevalence of which has
increased despite the availability of interventions to control blood
sugar and blood pressure (3). In the past several years, various
studies (4­8) have highlighted the importance of higher body
mass as a risk factor for kidney impairment; however, few studies
have focused on renal consequences of obesity among young
adults or in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
The prevalence of early CKD has also increased in the past two
decades (9). Albuminuria is an early marker of CKD, as well as a
predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the general
population (10­12), with well-documented correlates and conse-
quences of albuminuria in older adults, including hypertension,
diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome (12,13). Because albumin-
uria appears early in the natural history of kidney disease, it is a
potential target of primary prevention (14).
The purpose of this study was to assess the hypothesis that
body mass index (BMI) and obesity were related to albuminuria in
young adults who participated in the third wave of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health Wave III).
A better understanding of this association in this age group will
improve our understanding of cause as well as guide prevention
and intervention. This study also allowed assessment of urinalysis
results among a large population of young adults, which has not
been well described in this age group.
Concise Methods
Study Population
A subsample of young adults who were aged 18 to 26 yr and
participated in the Add Health study were evaluated for this study. The
Add Health cohort was originally selected as a nationally representa-
tive school-based study of youths aged 12 to 19 (Wave I, 1994 to 1995)
to assess health-related behaviors and their outcomes in young adult-
hood. The study used multistage, stratified, school-based, clustered
sampling to ensure that the schools were representative of all US

schools (15). Briefly, 80 high schools, each paired with a feeder middle
school, were selected from all high schools with more than 30 students.
Within schools, students were stratified by grade and sex, then ran-
domly selected within stratum with approximately 200 selected from
each school pair. Oversampling was conducted within select minority
groups. A total of 20,475 individuals were enrolled in Wave I. Wave III,
conducted between 2001 and 2002, included 15,170 (76%) Wave I re-
spondents. Study procedures were approved by the institutional re-
view board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Data and Specimen Collection and Definitions
Participants entered directly into a computer self-reported survey responses
on demographics, education, socioeconomic status, height, weight, medical
conditions, exercise frequency, and smoking history. Field workers also mea-
sured height and weight. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared (kg/m2), using measured height and weight or
self-reported values when not measured (n  136).
Participants provided a random (i.e., any time of day) first-stream 15-
to 20-ml urine sample with the primary purpose for evaluation of
sexually transmitted diseases in participants and their romantic part-
ners (16). Urine samples were stored at 4°C until shipped overnight
with ice packs in insulated containers. Automated urinalysis was per-
formed using the Roche Chemstrip 10 UA urine dipsticks and a Roche
Urisys 1800 System Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)
within 72 h of collection. The remaining urine was stored at 70°C for
measurement of albuminuria approximately 1 wk later.
A total of 12,566 urine samples were available. Samples that were at
room temperature, improperly shipped, or insufficient were discarded
(n  390). All other samples (n  12,176) underwent urinalysis evalu-
ation. Exclusions were applied later, when urine results were merged
with the full Add Health data set. Urine samples from romantic part-
ners (n  1308) and from pregnant (n  390) or menstruating (n  1107)
women were excluded, leaving 9371 samples for urinalysis evaluation.
Urinalysis results were defined as positive for protein when 30
mg/dl (0.30 g/L), red blood cells (RBC) when 25 erythrocytes per l,
white blood cells (WBC) when 25 per L, and glycosuria when urine
glucose was 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/L) (17). Two quality control urinal-
yses were conducted each day samples were evaluated.
Urine albumin and creatinine were measured by the Roche Cobas
Mira analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Albumin was
quantified using the Roche Tina-quant Albumin reagent, an immuno-
turbidimetric method for the in vitro measurement of human albumin
in the urine, and measured spectrophotometrically. Albuminuria was
defined using sex-specific albumin-to-creatinine ratios of 17 mg/g in
men and 25 mg/g in women (18).
Albuminuria was evaluated in a subset of respondents, chosen by
BMI to maximize statistical power. Of the 10,868 adequate specimens
from Wave I participants (romantic partners excluded), 2100 samples
were randomly selected from three BMI groups (n  6300): 25, 25 to
30, and 30 kg/m2. To limit false-positive albuminuria values, we also
applied exclusions on the basis of the population-based Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease (PREVEND) study (17,19) by
excluding pregnant (n  224) or menstruating (n  680) women and
those with 75 WBC/l (n  834) or 50 RBC/l (n  139; of these 834
and 139 samples, 40 were in the same participant). Urinalysis-based
exclusion criteria were applied to rule out albuminuria associated with
urinary tract infections or non­kidney-related hematuria; therefore,
they differ from definitions used to describe urinalysis findings, with
the exception of glycosuria. Upon applying exclusion criteria after
urine results were merged with the full Add Health data set, 4463
respondents were included in the albuminuria analysis.
The obesity category was further divided into BMI from 30 to 35
kg/m2 (class I obesity) and BMI of 35 kg/m2 (class II or greater
obesity) (20). History of hypertension and diabetes was self-reported.
Because adult values for obesity are not applicable to adolescent BMI,
age- and sex-specific percentiles of BMI based on 2000 Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention growth charts was used (21), then
categorized as 50th, 50th and 75th, 75th and 95th, and 95th
percentiles. Change in BMI from Wave I to Wave III was also evaluated.
Additional measures used in this study included education, health
insurance status (insured versus noninsured), having smoked at least
one cigarette within the past 30 d, and any or heavy exercise two or
more times in the week before the interview.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics included frequencies and percentages or means
with standard errors (SE) for demographic, health characteristics, and
urinalysis results. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association
of BMI categories with albuminuria. We also assessed associations of
albuminuria with race, sex, Wave I BMI, education, health insurance,
diabetes, glycosuria, hypertension, exercise, low birth weight, and smok-
ing. Variables that were associated with albuminuria in univariate analysis
or that influenced the association between BMI and albuminuria by 20%
were retained in the final multivariate model. Multiplicative interactions of
BMI with sex, race, and glycosuria were explored using logistic regression
models. Interaction terms with P  0.15 (P interaction) led to evaluation of
separate models by interaction terms. Logistic regression results are ex-
pressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P
values. All analyses were weighted for sample selection probabilities and
nonresponse using SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC).
Results
The Add Health respondents for whom urinalysis (n  9371)
and albuminuria (n  4463) were evaluated for this study were
similar to the overall Add Health Wave III respondents (n 
15,197) with respect to age, education, health insurance, diabe-
tes, hypertension, and smoking (Table 1). Because of oversam-
pling of overweight individuals and exclusion of pregnant and
menstruating women, BMI and sex were significantly different
(P  0.05) in the albuminuria assessment group compared with
the overall cohort. Race/ethnicity and exercise were also dif-
ferent between these two groups (P  0.05).
Elevations of urine protein, RBC, and WBC are depicted in
Figure 1. The most common findings were WBC 25/l in
14.7% of respondents (n  1382), followed by hematuria (RBC
25/l) in 4.6% (n  432) and proteinuria (30 mg/dl) in 0.8%
(n  73). As shown in Figure 1, proteinuria in the absence of
other urinary abnormalities was seen in 0.5%, with the other
0.3% overlapping with hematuria, increased WBC, or both.
Glycosuria was evident in 1.5% (n  142) of respondents.
The median measured albumin-to-creatinine ratio (n  4463)
was 2.3 mg/g (range 0.0 to 7641.0). Albuminuria was prevalent
in 4.4% (n  194) of respondents. Among those with albumin-
uria, dipstick proteinuria was positive (30 mg/dl) in 11.9%
(n  23). With the exception of BMI, those with and without
albuminuria were not statistically different across many char-
acteristics, although those with albuminuria had consistently
higher representation of black race, Hispanic ethnicity, hyper-
tension, and glycosuria (Table 2). Mean BMI was significantly
higher (P  0.01) among those with albuminuria (29.4  0.6

kg/m2) compared with those without albuminuria (28.3  0.2
kg/m2; Table 2). There was a nonlinear association between
BMI and albuminuria, with only the highest BMI category (35
kg/m2) related to albuminuria compared with the reference
group (25 kg/m2), with an OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.04; P 
0.04; (Table 3), controlling for sex, ethnicity, and glycosuria
(Table 3). Consistent results were seen when adjusting for
additional covariates including education, hypertension, health
insurance, diabetes or both diabetes and glycosuria, exercise,
and smoking. The only other measure that was associated with
albuminuria was glycosuria (OR 4.04; 95% CI 1.47 to 11.1; P 
0.01), controlling for sex, ethnicity, and BMI (Table 3).
Heterogeneity of the association between albuminuria and
the highest BMI category (35 kg/m2) was evident by sex
(P interaction  0.08), ethnicity (P interaction  0.02), and
glycosuria (P interaction  0.01). Figure 2 shows the unadjusted
prevalence of albuminuria by class II or greater obesity (35
kg/m2) within race/ethnicity and sex subgroups. White and
black men showed much greater prevalence of albuminuria in
the class II or higher group compared with others. Separate
models were evaluated within combined sex and race/ethnic-
ity categories, but CI were too wide to provide accurate esti-
mates; however, the models suggested that the strongest asso-
ciations between albuminuria and the highest BMI category

(35 kg/m2) were among white and black men. Because only
2% of participants had glycosuria, no separate modeling was
done among this group.
At Wave I, 13% of respondents were 95th percentile of age-
and sex-specific growth charts. Wave I BMI neither as a continu-
ous measure (P  0.33) nor as a categorical measure, including the
highest BMI category (95th versus 50th percentile; P  0.45)
were related to albuminuria; however, each kg/m2 unit increase
in BMI between Wave I and Wave III over approximately 6 yr was
associated with increased odds for albuminuria (OR 1.07; 95% CI
1.00 to 1.13; P  0.04), in an adjusted model controlling for sex,
ethnicity, glycosuria, and Wave I BMI.
Discussion
This study supports an association between morbid obesity and
the presence of albuminuria in young adults, because only the
highest level of BMI (35 kg/m2) was associated with albumin-
uria. The association was particularly evident among both black
and white men. This study also reveals a prevalence of elevated
glycosuria that is considerably higher than in previous reports,
whereas other urinalysis results are within range of previous
studies, although there have been few estimates in young adults.
Our findings are consistent with other reports that link
higher BMI with ESKD (7,8), CKD (4­6), and albuminuria
(4,22­27). Two cohort studies have shown evidence of an asso-
ciation between higher BMI and development of ESKD (7,8),
with one study finding an association only in men (8), consis-
tent with our findings. In another study, ESKD risk increased
across categories of obesity among participants who were fol-
lowed for an average of 26 yr (7), with the strongest associa-
tions among young adults (age 40). Several studies (4­6)
have also shown an association between higher BMI and risk
for CKD, defined by reduced estimated GFR.
Similar to our study, Verhave et al. (22) found an association
between BMI and albuminuria in a Dutch population. Other stud-
ies (22­30) supported this association, but most relevant to this
study, two US cohort studies evaluated the association of BMI and
albuminuria in younger adult populations: The Coronary Artery
Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study (24) and the
Bogalusa Heart Study (25). In the CARDIA study, subjects aged 18
to 30 yr were enrolled; albuminuria was measured at 10 and 15 yr
and found in 6.3 and 6.7% of participants, respectively. A U-
shaped relation was observed between quartiles of BMI measured
at year 10 and albumin excretion, independent of BP and fasting
glucose. The Bogalusa study enrolled subjects aged 5 to 17 yr and
found a 4.7% prevalence of albuminuria at 16 yr of follow-up.
Childhood BMI was not associated with adult albuminuria,
whereas the relationship of adult BMI and albuminuria was not
reported. One limitation of these two cohort studies is that partic-
ipants were enrolled in the 1970s and 1980s, well before the
dramatic increase in obesity in the US population that our study
captures.
In this study, change in BMI over 6 yr but not baseline BMI
was associated with albuminuria at follow-up, suggesting that
growth in body mass may occur faster than the kidneys can
adapt. Only one other study evaluated the relationship of
change in BMI with kidney function using data from the Phy-
sicians Health Study, which is not directly comparable because
of the older age of their cohort and use of a GFR-based measure
of CKD (31). Nevertheless, our results are consistent with
theirs, because they found that an increase in BMI 10% over
14 yr was associated with a 27% increased risk for CKD. Other
studies were cross-sectional or evaluated a single measurement
of baseline BMI or obesity (7,8,32).
Obesity-related glomerulopathy has been well described,
with damage to the kidney suspected through a combination of
hyperfiltration, high protein and salt intake, hypertension, hy-
perinsulinemia, and increased tubuloglomerular feedback as a
result of increased sodium reabsorption, dyslipidemia, inflam-
mation, and elevated leptin levels (33­35). A frequent compli-
cation of obesity-associated glomerulopathy is secondary FSGS
(34). Renal biopsy diagnosis of obesity-related glomerulopathy,
which often manifests clinically as albuminuria, has increased
10-fold in 15 yr, with a trend for more frequent diagnosis
among men than women (1.6:1) compared with primary FSGS
(1:1; P  0.09) (34). This result in conjunction with our finding
of an association of high BMI and albuminuria in men suggests
that there may be an absolute body size, not just a proportional
mass, that stresses the capacity of the kidney.
Urinalysis estimates from our study are important because
few studies have reported these findings among young adults
(36), with most evaluations among children (37­39) or older
adults (40­43). The 4.6% prevalence of hematuria in our study
is generally higher than reports of 0.5 to 4.1% in pediatric and
adolescent studies (37­39), well above the 1.7% among young
adults (mean age 21.8 yr) who were screened in the United
Kingdom (44) yet similar to adult prevalence reports (42,43).
Figure 1. Urinalysis results of proteinuria and hematuria, with
elevated white blood cells (WBC) also shown because their
presence could lead to a false-positive evaluation of protein
excretion. Hematuria (red blood cells [RBC] 25/l) was found
in 4.6% (n  432) and proteinuria (30 mg/dl) in 0.8% (n  73).
Proteinuria may have been falsely elevated as a result of the
presence of WBC in 0.13%, meaning that approximately 0.6%
had elevated proteinuria, with 0.1% having both proteinuria
and hematuria.

Proteinuria (30 mg/dl) in the absence of leukocyturia and
hematuria among 0.5% in our study is consistent with pediatric
and adolescent studies (37­39), as well as with adult studies
(42,43). Our finding of dipstick proteinuria (30 mg/dl) in just
11.9% of those with albuminuria highlights the danger of rely-
ing solely on dipstick measures, which, unlike albumin-to-
creatinine ratio, do not take urine concentration into account.
Glycosuria among 1.5% in this study, considerably higher than
in other studies (43,44), is likely related to the high frequency of
overweight and obesity that is, in turn, associated with more
frequent and often undiagnosed diabetes.
This study has several strengths. We used a sample drawn from
the general US population of young adults. The large sample size
of 4000 young adults, although not the full Add Health cohort,
had sufficient statistical power to study the relationship between
albuminuria and obesity, with statistical differences in class II or
greater obesity (35 kg/m2) detected between those with and
without albuminuria. However, it should be noted that sample
weighting adjustments specifically based on urinalysis exclusion
criteria were not used in the analysis, so caution should be used in
making inferences to the general US population of young adults.
Another strength is that the Add Health study population is
composed of an understudied young adult population, with a
mean age of 21.7 yr. This group represents the ideal target for
primary prevention of CKD. Our study also included Hispanic
individuals, another understudied population in which advanced
kidney disease is becoming more prevalent (45,46). Disparities
faced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States may take
decades to develop, which could explain the lack of association
between race/ethnicity and albuminuria (47). Nevertheless, the
association between high BMI and albuminuria was highest
among black men.
There are several limitations to our study. Definitive kidney
disease cannot be assessed using a single urine specimen,
which may be subject to random variation and transient pro-
teinuria from prolonged standing or exercise (48); however,

single-measure albuminuria does reflect a chronic condition in
63% of the general population (30). Urine was collected at any
time during the day, whereas first-morning midstream urine
may be preferred for albuminuria assessment and urinalysis
(19,42). Urinary measures were evaluated only at the Wave III
study visit, precluding assessment of incident cases of albumin-
uria. This study also lacked many clinical attributes, such as
measured blood pressure, serum creatinine, and medication
use; however, self-reported hypertension and diabetes were
available, and measured glycosuria may indicate undiagnosed
or undertreated diabetes. Two studies in adult populations
(mean ages of approximately 50) suggested that obesity as a
risk factor for albuminuria and CKD may be confounded by
larger waist circumference (49) and that waist-to-hip ratio may
provide additional information on risk (50). Unfortunately, these
measurements were not available for this study. Also, changes in
BMI for people who cross from adolescence into young adulthood
are difficult to assess because different standards are used for
these ages; however, a recent study (51) suggested that among
adolescents, change in actual BMI works better than change in
standardized BMI z score for longitudinal studies.
Despite these limitations, this study represents a large sample of
young adults in the United States, and the finding of albuminuria
associated with obesity is particularly concerning. Primary pre-
ventive strategies are needed to stem rising rates of CKD, and
obesity is a potential target. If there is in fact a causal link between
obesity and kidney disease, then rising obesity prevalence por-
tends a continuing rise in kidney disease rates in the United States.
The guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommend screen-
ing for albuminuria among people who are at risk for kidney
disease, including those with established diabetes or hyperten-
sion, other systemic illnesses, family history of kidney disease, and
age 60 yr (10). Obesity may be a novel candidate screening
criterion. A prospective study of the relationship between obesity
and early markers of kidney damage in young adults is warranted.
