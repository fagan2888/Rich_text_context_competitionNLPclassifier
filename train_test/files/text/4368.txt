Introduction
This case study looks at how Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing (EMDR) was effective for one individual
experiencing medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) of
chronic pain in his abdomen. EMDR is briefly explained as
is how it has been adapted to be used with pain. The case
study will hopefully give professionals working in a primary
care environment an additional treatment option for this at
times difficult to manage client group.
The Royal College of Psychiatry1 define MUS as
"Persistent physical complaints that do not have a readily
recognizable medical cause. The pain, worry and other
symptoms are nonetheless real and cause distress."According
to the Royal College of Psychiatry, people of all ages with
MUS present frequently to the health services and state that
contacts with primary care clinicians may be at least 50%
more frequent per person than in the general population, and
they may also account for up to 33% more secondary care
consultations. From a monetary point of view, MUS have
been estimated to cost the National Health Service (NHS) in
England £3 billion every year.
Research suggests that up to 70% of people suffering with
MUS will also suffer from depression and/or anxiety disor-
ders.2 In addition to the distress caused to the individual,
many health professionals feel frustrated and ill-equipped to
tackle clinical presentations with no physical pathological
cause. At times, individuals with MUS are debilitated by their
conditions, are unable to work, and have poor quality of life.
Generally, treatment of MUS is managed within a medical
setting with referrals for psychological input limited.
However, the spiraling cost of managing patients with MUS
has led to more resources being made available to address this
problem from an emotional and psychological perspective.
What Is EMDR?
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, EMDR,
was developed by Francine Shapiro 25 years ago. It is a type
of psychological therapy that was originally designed to alle-
viate the distress of traumatic memories. The most concise
definition is taken from the EMDR Institute (n.d.) website:
Shapiro's (2001) Adaptive Information Processing model posits
that EMDR facilitates the accessing and processing of traumatic
memories to bring these to an adaptive resolution.After successful
treatment with EMDR, affective distress is relieved, negative
beliefs are reformulated, and physiological arousal is reduced.
During a typical EMDR session, the client focuses on
emotionally disturbing material while focusing on an exter-
nal stimulus in the form of therapist directed eye movements,
audio stimulation, or tactile stimulation to create bi-lateral
stimulation (BLS) of the brain. Shapiro (2001) believes that
following treatment of EMDR on a traumatic memory, infor-
mation processing is enhanced and new associations are
forged resulting in new learning, elimination of emotional
distress, and development of cognitive insights.

EMDR and the Treatment of Medically
Unexplained Symptoms: A Case Study
Simon Proudlock1
Abstract
This current research used a single case study design to examine how Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
(EMDR) was effective for one individual experiencing medically unexplained chronic pain in his abdomen. EMDR is briefly
explained as is how it has been adapted to be used with pain. A brief literature review is also included.

2 SAGE Open
Roos (2009) and in Grant (2009). Van Rood and de Roos
(2009) believe unprocessed traumatic experiences might
maintain physically unexplained complaints, and triggers to
that unprocessed traumatic experience trigger not only the
memory but also physical sensations (e.g., pain) that were
experienced at the time. Both authors note that the meaning
may either trigger a traumatic memory or the pain. This can
represent a kind of trauma in itself. This two-way interaction
between pain and trauma is thought to maintain both (see
also Grant, 2009).
Ray and Zbik (2001) review the use of EMDR therapy for
chronic pain and note that EMDR gives benefits to chronic
pain patients not found with other treatments. They found
EMDR can do more than just manage pain but can substan-
tially reduce or eliminate it.
Grant and Threlfo (2002) outline how EMDR can help to
improve coping and reduce chronic pain and suffering. They
examined the use of EMDR with three adult chronic pain
sufferers and noticed that all clients reported substantial
decreases in pain levels, decreases in negative affect, and
increased ability to control their pain. Similarly, Hassard
(1995) describes how EMDR helped 12 out of 19 patients
who completed treatment to significantly reduce their pain.
Mazzola et al. (2009) also found pain tolerance was signifi-
cantly improved for the two treatment groups using EMDR.
EMDR and Pain
Within EMDR, the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP)
model views chronic pain as a kind of recurring "trauma"
with the traumatic event consisting of recurring pain attacks
or constant physical discomfort (EMDR Part 3 Training
Manual Courtesy of Alexandra Richman, n.d.). Mazzola
et al. (2009, p.75) note, "EMDR treatment of chronic pain
includes the processing and desensitization of both; the auto-
matic emotional response to the pain sensation, and the auto-
matic components of the stored memories related to the
etiology of pain." Grant (2009) also notes that chronic pain
can represent a kind of trauma in itself as pain can involve
feelings of helplessness, intrusive thoughts, loss of control,
and increased physiological arousal.
Grant's (2012) chronic pain protocol divides the targets
into trauma, pain, or some aspect of how the pain is affecting
the person's life. As with trauma, the Negative Cognition
(NC) reflects how the person feels about themselves. The
positive cognition represents what they would like to be able
to say about themselves. Other elements of the target, such as
feelings sensations and subjective units of distress (SUD),
are more or less the same with the exception that the SUDs
may be used to rate pain or emotional distress.
Once the above information has been gathered, BLS (e.g.,
eye-movements/tactile sensors) is used to desensitize the cli-
ent by asking them to focus solely on the pain. During desen-
sitization, if any blocking beliefs are identified, cognitive
interweaves (such as asking the client to imagine that they
can see inside their bodies and see what is causing the pain,
or asking what is stopping the pain from changing) can be
used. Desensitization continues until the clients' pain has
reduced. Once the pain has stabilized at a more tolerable
level, installation of a positive imagery related to what the
client experiences now is completed, followed by the instal-
lation of the positive cognition.
Unlike the standard EMDR protocol, when using the pain
protocol, we are not necessarily expecting to reduce the rat-
ing (SUDs or level of intensity) down to a 0 or 1. In most
cases, a reduction in the intensity of the pain, or a reduction
in the hold the pain has on an individual's general level of
functioning, is a welcome enough change. By giving clients
a greater understanding of their pain, and a degree of control
over their pain, the client comes to believe that they can have
more control over the pain and its effects on their life.
Case Background
Full written consent was obtained from the client prior to
writing this article. Names and identifying details have been
changed.
Michael contacted me through my private practice fol-
lowing his search for an EMDR therapist. He had tried for
nearly 3½ years to get some sort of explanation for the pain
emanating from his stomach/abdomen and to learn how to
better manage his pain.
History
Michael is a White British male who at the commencement
of treatment was in his late 50s. Over 4 years prior to treat-
ment, Michael was the driver of a car involved in a road traf-
fic accident inAfrica which left him paralyzed from the chest
downward due to a dislocated neck and a complete break of
the spinal cord (injury from C6). Michael was in Africa to
run a marathon and was an accomplished athlete with an
international reputation in extreme sports.
Following the accident, Michael spent 2 weeks in hospi-
tals in Africa before being flown back to England. Following
a 10-month stay in an NHS spinal injuries unit, he returned
home. It was at this time that the pain in his stomach started.
He reports that he received no psychological help while in
the spinal injuries unit.
Michael reported that he generally felt quite anxious,
more so in the mornings. He had very little recollection of
the actual accident, remembering tiny snippets only and had
never had nightmares, and reported occasional flashbacks of
the moment when his friend shouted in the car just prior to
impact. Initially after coming home, he continued to work in
his role as an IT Manager but eventually the pain got intoler-
able for him and he left his job.
At the commencement of treatment, the pain in Michael's
abdomen was causing significant disruption to his everyday
activity level--he would try and do a bit of work, but very
Proudlock 3
soon, the pain and discomfort became too much. Similarly, it
was restricting him going out and doing any sort of exercise
to strengthen his muscles. Michael had a good social net-
work but found that he often had to cancel social engage-
ments at the last minute due to pain flare-ups.
Prior to seeing myself, Michael had seen two psycholo-
gists and a hypnotist, all without much benefit.
On taking a full history, there were no significant traumas
prior to the index incident. For the memories of the accident,
Michael scored 24 on the Impact of Events­Revised scale
(Weiss & Marmar, 1996) indicating that there was no signifi-
cant psychological trauma associated with the index incident.
Treatment
Following our initial assessment session, our second session
commenced with trying to help Michael install a "safe
place"--a psychological resource of a memory or image in
which Michael felt safe, calm, and relaxed, together with a
word that summed up that image and associated feeling.
Although Michael did not appear to be traumatized by the
accident itself, a psychological resource in which he could
feel calmer may help him cope with his fear of uncontrolla-
ble pain. We also tested which method of BLS would work
best with Michael. Initially, I tried eye movements, and then
ear phones and then tactile sensors. Although I was initially
reserved about using the tactile sensors due to the location of
spinal cord damage, Michael felt these, turned up to high
intensity, worked best for him.
As there was clearly a traumatic index incident, standard
EMDR protocol was used prior to introducing the chronic pain
protocol to rule out that there was no residual trauma fueling
Michael's pain. Michael identified the worst picture from the
accident as his friend shouting his name, with the associated
negative belief of "I'm stupid," feelings of dread, and SUD as
5 to 6 out of 10, which he felt in his head. When using BLS, he
initially felt upset, but generally noticed very little change.
After a few sets of BLS, Michael reported feeling less dis-
tressed by the image and he had a new memory emerging of
being in the embankment where the car came to rest following
the accident. He noticed that nothing changed in his body.
At the next session, and for the majority of sessions fol-
lowing that, we focused solely on the pain in Michael's abdo-
men. We discussed the memory of when he first noticed the
pain (on returning to his home after a prolonged stay in
the spinal injuries unit) and subsequent memories of when
the pain was bad. Negative cognitions varied but focused
around not being in control and believing he was worthless
("I'm a waste of space"). As our work progressed, the nega-
tive cognitions changed to "I'm Helpless." Later sessions
also identified negative cognitions focused around self-
blame. General feelings were of frustration at not being able
to perform activities of everyday living because of the pain.
On first targeting the pain using EMDR, Michael
described the pain as a burning sensation--a pressure in his
stomach as if it had been pumped up. The color of the pain
was "red," and the level of intensity was 8 out of 10. At the
end of Session 3, our first session targeting just the pain, the
level of intensity had reduced to a 5. Michael later reported
that this relief continued for the rest of the evening after our
session but the level returned to 8 and higher the next day.
At different times of the processing, Michael would expe-
rience intense pain and at times would feel he was holding
back his emotions. By altering the speed of the tactile sen-
sors, we discovered that if they went slower, then the pain
would generally be less intense, but if they went faster, then
the pain would become more intense.
Michael reported a whole range of different sensations
and experiences over the course of our work. These, together
with my own observations, are listed below, as they illustrate
the variety of sensory changes that Michael experienced dur-
ing his treatment:
·
· Twitching of his face, hands, and shoulders
·
· Getting emotionally upset
·
· Tension in his body
·
· Constantly feeling like he wanted to move his legs
·
· Changes in the pain--sharp, stabbing, pressure, tight,
burning
·
· Changes in location and shape of the pain
·
· Feeling like something was going to burst out of his
stomach
·
· Feeling more relaxed in his body
·
· Tingling in his body
·
· Leg feeling warm--since the accident, Michael has
suffered from poor circulation and always felt his legs
were cold (generally he does not get any feeling in his
legs)
·
· Feeling like he wanted to move his foot or wanting to
stretch
·
· Shudders of his entire body
On almost all occasions when using the BLS, the pain
changed in terms of intensity, location, sensation, or type of
pain. At times, these changes were associated with different
feelings and levels of emotional distress. Toward the end of
our sessions, it tended to take longer for Michael to notice
any changes in the pain. Bi-lateral sets were increased con-
siderably in length of time with good effect. During these
sessions, the pain would build up, reach a peak, and then
gradually subside again (similar to emotional distress when
using standard EMDR protocol).
Once the level of intensity of the pain had stabilized at 2/10,
the positive cognition of "I can handle it" was installed, which
helped reinforce Michael's belief in his ability to control his
pain.As the pain became more manageable, the focus turned to
current triggers of when he noticed the pain more (such as hear-
ing his carers take a shower while he was stuck in bed).
In addition to EMDR, Michael's treatment also incorporated
Solution Focused Therapy (SFT) and Cognitive Behavioral
4 SAGE Open
Therapy (CBT). Using principles of behavioral activation,
Michael was encouraged to start doing more activities even
if he felt pain--that is, to just do something and see if the
pain gets worse.
Michael had begun to be more aware of the pain and to
notice times when it was not as bad and started to question why
that was. Using principles of SFT, these "exceptions" of when
the pain was not as bad were explored to see whether he could
do more of what made the pain less (see Proudlock, 2011).
At our last session, Session 14, Michael expressed that he
was no longer really bothered by the pain. Subjectively and
objectively, he felt less depressed and the level of intensity of
the pain was around a 3 out of 10. He had written a brief but
angry goodbye letter to pain and felt that the pain was no
longer consuming and controlling his life.
At 6-month follow-up, Michael reported he was no longer
depressed but had suffered from repeated bladder infections,
causing abdominal pain and discomfort. His main carer had
left after working with him for 3 years, and this had clearly
upset him. We embarked on six further top up sessions and
used EMDR to process this loss and the associated feelings.
Again Michael reported less pain in his abdomen. Michael
had also signed up to a sponsored cycle ride in South Africa
in November 2013.
Discussion and Areas for Further
Research
There is a growing body of evidence indicating that EMDR
is an effective psychological therapy in assisting clients with
MUS. In this case study, EMDR helped an individual who
had spent over 3 years looking for an explanation and relief
from abdominal pain. The exact way EMDR works in gen-
eral is still unclear, but one theory is that it decreases the
increased physiological arousal that maintains pain through a
relaxation effect (Grant, 2012).
Michael was a determined and motivated client who per-
severed through some demanding sessions. He welcomed
articles on EMDR and found The Body Keeps the Score (van
der Kolk, 1994) most useful. At one point, he had to face the
realization that he saw himself as "helpless" and "depen-
dant" on his caregivers for most of his needs, and this insight
allowed him to see that some of his pain symptoms may be
psychological in nature. On leaving a safe environment of
the spinal injuries unit, the reality of his situation struck him
once he was back home.
The outcomes of treatment for Michael were consider-
able--he was able to reduce the quantity of the high potency
synthetic opiate painkillers he was taking as the pain became
more bearable and his need for medication greatly reduced
(prior to treatment he told me he was taking analgesics like
"Smarties"). He also needed to take to his bed and lie down
less often, was able to travel in the car more regularly without
feeling sick (something that had caused great restriction in
his life), and started to socialize more with friends. He even
had some pain-free days which allowed him to do more exer-
cise to strengthen his muscles and start hydrotherapy. From a
psychological perspective, his negative cognition started to
change to "I'm taking control"--at our last session, he told
me, "I can do what I want even with the pain."
In this case study, it is clear that EMDR had a beneficial
effect when other therapies seemed to have not been helpful
to Michael. Some of the extenuating factors that may have
aided the benefit of EMDR may be the high level of motiva-
tion that client had--he had clearly researched EMDR before
making contact with me. I also made it clear from the start of
therapy that EMDR would not be a "cure" for his pain but
may allow him to manage the pain more effectively, clearly
managing his expectations for therapy.
Although EMDR was the primary therapeutic interven-
tion in this case, the principles of CBT and SFT also played
a significant part. Throughout my clinical practice, I rarely
use just one type of therapy, preferring instead an eclectic
approach that morphs itself into what the client needs at that
particular time. EMDR may have been the catalyst that
allowed the benefit of Michael's other therapies to be fully
utilized--in other cases, where I have used EMDR with cli-
ents who have had therapy before, EMDR seems to unblock
something that enables increased clarity for the client, allow-
ing the benefits of previous therapies to kick in.
A limitation of the study was the lack of objective mea-
sures to quantify the changes in Michael's pain, anxiety, and
functioning. Another limitation was the fact that it only
involves one case. As such, with no control case to measure
against, it is hard to tell whether Michael would have started
to feel better with the passage of time irrespective of any
therapy offered.
Conclusion
MUS are notoriously difficult to treat. This case study indi-
cates that EMDR could have potential as a treatment for
people with this kind of pain. Like other reports regarding
EMDR treatment of pain, this case suggests that EMDR can
help alleviate the pain and improve coping--traditional
approaches do not tend to be very effective for pain relief.
The amount of sessions required, in this case 20 in total, also
indicates that EMDR can be more efficient than traditional
approaches to pain management.
Although EMDR was the main modality used in this case,
my own and other practitioners experience is that when used
in conjunction with other therapies, the psychological bene-
fits for the client seem to be magnified when a combination of
therapies are used. The level of client motivation may also
play a key part in the successful outcomes of EMDR for
MUS--in this case study, the client was highly motivated and
Proudlock 5
already had some insight into the psychological mechanisms
that may be interacting with his physical pain.
This case adds to the growing literature regarding EMDR
treatment of chronic pain. More research is needed to inves-
tigate whether the method is efficacious with other MUS suf-
ferers and whether EMDR needs to be considered as an
option early on in treatment.
