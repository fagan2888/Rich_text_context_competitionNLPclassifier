Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Lifetime Suicide
Attempts in the National Comorbidity Survey
Ronald C. Kessler, PhD; Guilherme Borges, ScD; Ellen E. Walters, MS
Background: General population survey data are pre-
sented on the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts as
well as transition probabilities to onset of ideation, plans
among ideators, and attempts among ideators either with
or without a plan. Risk factors for these transitions are
also studied.
Methods: Data are from part II of the National Comor-
bidity Survey, a nationally representative survey carried
out from 1990 to 1992 in a sample of 5877 respondents
aged 15 to 54 years to study prevalences and correlates
of DSM-III-R disorders. Transitions are estimated using
life-table analysis. Risk factors are examined using sur-
vival analysis.
Results: Of the respondents, 13.5% reported lifetime ide-
ation, 3.9% a plan, and 4.6% an attempt. Cumulative prob-
abilities were 34% for the transition from ideation to a
plan, 72% from a plan to an attempt, and 26% from ide-
ation to an unplanned attempt. About 90% of un-
planned and 60% of planned first attempts occurred within
1 year of the onset of ideation. All significant risk fac-
tors (female, previously married, age less than 25 years,
in a recent cohort, poorly educated, and having 1 or more
of the DSM-III-R disorders assessed in the survey) were
more strongly related to ideation than to progression from
ideation to a plan or an attempt.
Conclusions: Prevention efforts should focus on planned
attempts because of the rapid onset and unpredictabil-
ity of unplanned attempts. More research is needed on
the determinants of unplanned attempts.

THIS REPORT presents nation-
ally representative data on
the prevalence and risk fac-
tors of attempted suicide in
the National Comorbidity
Survey (NCS).1 The motivations are that at-
tempted suicide is both one of the stron-
gestriskfactorsforcompletedsuicide2-4 and
an important indicator of extreme emo-
tional distress.5,6 Previous epidemiologic
studies in the United States have esti-
mated that between 1.1%7 and 4.3%8 of the
population attempt suicide at some time in
their life. However, no previous epidemio-
logic survey has investigated either trends
in prevalence across cohorts or condi-
tionalriskofattemptsinrelationtotheprior
onset of ideation and plans or in relation
to intercohort differences; these are a fo-
cus of the current report. This report also
examines sociodemographic variables and
DSM-III-R disorders as risk factors for at-
tempted suicide. Previous research has
documented that some demographic vari-
ables are risk factors for attempted sui-
cide, including age,8-10 sex (reviewed by
Moscicki11), marital status,12,13 educa-
tion,8,13,14 race,13,15,16 and childbearing.17 In
addition, several studies of adults14,18,19 and
youth9,20-23 have examined the parallel ef-
fects of demographic variables on both ide-
ation and attempts. However, no previous
study has disaggregated these effects into
influences on ideation, the transition from
ideation to a plan, and the transition from
ideation to an attempt either in the pres-
ence or absence of a plan. As shown be-
low, insights gleaned from this disaggre-
gationhaveusefulimplicationsfortargeting
preventive interventions.
RESULTS
PREVALENCES
The estimated lifetime prevalences (SEs)
of suicide ideation, plans, and attempts in
the NCS are 13.5% (0.6), 3.9% (0.4), and
4.6% (0.4), respectively. Attempters were
presented with 3 statements describing the
lethality of their attempt. Of the attempt-
ers, 39.3% (3.5) endorsed the statement
that they made a serious attempt, and it
was only because of luck that they did not
die; while 13.3% (2.1) endorsed the state-
ment that they were serious, but knew the
method was not foolproof; and the re-
maining 47.3% (3.9) endorsed the state-
ment that their attempt was a cry for help,
and they did not want to die.
The conditional probability of ever
making a plan among lifetime ideators was

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS was based on a nationally representative popu-
lation survey of 8098 persons aged 15 to 54 years carried
out from 1990 through 1992. Informed consent was ob-
tained from all respondents and also from parents of mi-
nors. The response rate was 82.4%. All 8098 respondents
were administered the part I interview, which averaged
somewhat more than 1 hour to complete and included the
assessment of DSM-III-R disorders. All respondents who
screened positive for a lifetime prevalence of any disorder
and a random subsample of other respondents were ad-
ministered the part II interview. The part II interview av-
eraged slightly more than 1 hour and consisted largely of
questions about risk factors and consequences of the dis-
orders assessed in part I. The suicidality questions were in-
cluded in the part II interview. As a result, the present re-
port is based on the 5877 respondents who participated in
the part II interview. The data for these respondents were
weighted to correct for differential probabilities of selec-
tion into part II as well as for differential probabilities of
within-household selection and nonresponse. Compari-
sons of the part II NCS demographic distributions with cen-
sus data show that the sample is representative of the US
population on a wide range of sociodemographic vari-
ables. More details about the NCS design and data collec-
tion methods are reported elsewhere.1,24
MEASURES
The questions about suicide ideation, plans, and attempts
are part of the life-event history section of the NCS inter-
view. Separate questions were asked about the lifetime
occurrence of suicide ideation ("Have you ever seriously
thought about committing suicide?"), suicide plans
("Have you ever made a plan for committing suicide?"),
and suicide attempts ("Have you ever attempted sui-
cide?"). For each of these outcomes, information was
obtained about age at first occurrence and the recency of
occurrence. Lethality of intent was assessed by reading 3
statements and asking attempters to select 1 of the 3 to
describe their first attempt. The first statement was "I
made a serious attempt to kill myself and it was only luck
that I did not succeed." The second statement was "I tried
to kill myself, but I knew the method was not foolproof."
The third statement was "My attempt was a cry for help; I
did not want to die."
The sociodemographic variables included in the analy-
sis are sex, marital status, cohort, educational attainment,
age of youngest child, race/ethnicity, and urbanicity. Mari-
tal status was coded to differentiate the currently married,
previously married (separated, divorced, widowed), and
never married. Cohort was coded to differentiate respon-
dents born in the decades 1936 to 1945, 1946 to 1955, 1956
to 1965, and 1966 to 1975. Educational attainment was
coded to differentiate current students from those who had
completed their schooling and, within each of these 2 cat-
egories, to differentiate those who had completed less than
high school, high school, some college, or college gradu-
ation or more. Age of the respondents' youngest child was
coded into 4 categories consisting of respondents who had
no living child and those whose youngest child was age 1
year, between ages 2 and 10 years, and more than age 10
years. Race/ethnicity was coded to differentiate among non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and all
others (Native Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and re-
spondents who self-defined themselves as "other"). Fi-
nally, urbanicity was coded to differentiate respondents liv-
ing in census-defined major metropolitan areas from those
living in other census-defined urbanized areas or in census-
defined nonurban areas.
DSM-III-R diagnoses were generated from a modified
version of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view (CIDI),25 a fully structured interview designed to be
used by trained interviewers who are not clinicians. World
Health Organization Field Trials26 and NCS clinical reap-
praisal studies27 both document good reliability and valid-
ity of most CIDI diagnoses, including mood disorders
(major depression and dysthymia), anxiety disorders
(panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, and
posttraumatic stress disorder), and substance use disorders
(alcohol abuse and dependence and drug abuse and
dependence). However, there are 2 important exceptions
involving mania28 and nonaffective psychosis, 29 neither of
which is assessed with adequate validity in the CIDI.
Because of these problems, a restricted definition of mania
(euphoric-grandiose subtype) and clinical diagnoses of
nonaffective psychosis were used rather than the CIDI
diagnoses in the analyses reported here. Conduct Disorder,
Adult Antisocial Behavior, and Antisocial Personality Dis-
order (the conjunction of Conduct Disorder and Adult
Antisocial Behavior) were assessed with the Diagnostic
Interview Schedule30 since these disorders are not included
in the CIDI.
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
All analyses were carried out using the SAS31 software pack-
age (SAS Inc, Cary, NC). Simple cross-tabulations were used
to investigate the associations among suicide ideation, plans,
and attempts. Life-table methods were used to examine age-
of-onset distributions. A discrete-time survival analysis with
time-varying covariates32 was used to study the risk fac-
tors of lifetime suicide ideation, plans, and attempts. The
use of this method in the NCS has been described in detail
previously.33 Retrospective reports were used in the sur-
vival analyses to create the time-varying risk factors (eg,
ages of changes in marital status) and to date the ages of
onset of the outcome variables.
Because of the complex sample design and weighting
of the NCS, SEs of the survival coefficients were estimated
using the Jacknife Repeated Replications34 simulation
method implemented in an SAS macro. The Jacknife
Repeated Replications estimates adjust for the clustering
and weighting of cases. The survival coefficients were
exponentiated and are reported below in the form of odds
ratios (ORs). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of these
coefficients are also reported and have been adjusted for
design effects. Multivariate tests are based on 2 values
computed from coefficient variance-covariance matrices
that were adjusted for design effects using Jacknife
Repeated Replications. When a result is specified as being
significant below, it is referring to statistical significance
based on 2-sided design-based tests evaluated at the .05
level.

28.9% (2.3), while the conditional probabilities of mak-
ing an attempt (ignoring lethality of intent) among ide-
ators were 57.9% (3.9) with a plan and 25.2% (1.9) with-
out a plan. Among attempters, 46.7% (3.7) reported that
they had a plan prior to making their first attempt.
ONSET DISTRIBUTIONS
Hazard curves (Figure 1) show that the highest risks of
initial suicide ideation, plans, and attempts (ignoring le-
thality of intent) are in the late teens and early 20s. Age-
of-onset curves (Figure 2) show that median ages of on-
set for all these outcomes are in the mid-20s. Conditional
age-of-onsetcurves(Figure 3)showthatprogressionfrom
ideation to first onset of a plan, from a plan to first at-
tempt, and from ideation to first attempt in the absence
of a plan were all highest in the first year after onset of the
earlier stage.
Two additional important results can be seen by com-
paring the curves for planned and unplanned attempts.
One is that risk of a first attempt among ideators was sub-
stantially higher in the presence of a plan. The other is
that risk of a first attempt among ideators who lack a plan
was largely limited to the first year after onset of ide-
ation. In comparison, risk of an attempt among ideators
with a plan not only was very high in the year of onset
of the plan, but also continued for many years after-
ward. In all, roughly 90% of unplanned attempts and 60%
of planned attempts occurred within 1 year of the onset
of ideation. Lethality of intent among attempters was not
significantly related either to the presence of a plan
(2
1
= 1.0; P = .31) or to speed of the attempt after onset
of ideation (2
1
= 1.2; P = .28).
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC RISK FACTORS
Risk of an attempt was significantly related to being fe-
male, being previously married, being born in a recent
cohort, and having a low educational level (Table 1).
The odds of an attempt were also lower among students
than among nonstudents at the same level of educa-
tional attainment. Although non-Hispanic blacks had sig-
nificantly lower odds of attempted suicide than non-
Hispanic whites, the 4-category race/ethnicity variable was
not significantly related to attempted suicide overall
(2
3
= 7.0; P = .07).
The higher odds of an attempt among women than
among men was related to 3 significant pathways, all with
roughly equal ORs (1.5-1.8): higher unconditional odds
of initial ideation, higher conditional odds of an at-
tempt among ideators with a plan, and higher condi-
tional odds of an attempt among ideators without a plan.
There was no significant sex difference among ideators
in the odds of making a plan. Interaction between sex
and cohort in predicting attempts was also tested based
on a suggestion that the sex difference might be smaller
in recent cohorts.35 No significant interaction was found
(2
3
= 5.0; P = .17).
The higher odds of an attempt among previously
married subjects than among currently married sub-
jects was related to 2 of these same 3 pathways, again with
roughly equal ORs (2.2): higher unconditional odds of
initial ideation and higher conditional odds of an at-
tempt among ideators with a plan. However, the second
variable was not statistically significant. Unmarried ide-
ators were not more likely than their married counter-
parts either to make a plan subsequent to the onset of

ideation or to make an attempt in the absence of a plan.
Interaction between marital status and age (coded as a
dichotomy for age 18 years or younger vs age 19 years
or older) was also tested based on the finding in previ-
ous research that the protective effect of marriage is less
strong or even reverses at early age.12 No significant in-
teraction was found (2
1
= 0.8; P = .39).
The higher odds of an attempt in more recent co-
horts than in earlier cohorts was related to to 3 some-
what different pathways. First, there was a significant in-
crease across cohorts, especially strong for the most recent
cohort (OR = 6.4), in the unconditional odds of ide-
ation. Second, there was a significant but less strong in-
crease in the conditional odds of making a plan among
ideators that was very similar across all cohorts born af-
ter World War II (OR = 1.6-3.2). Third, there was a sig-
nificant intercohort difference in the conditional odds of
an attempt among ideators in the absence of a plan
(2
3
= 9.6; P = .02). There were no significant interco-
hort differences in the conditional odds of an attempt
among ideators in the presence of a plan (2
3
=3.0; P =.39).
The significant negative association between edu-
cation and the odds of an attempt was related to 3 path-
ways: a modest association with unconditional risk of ide-
ation (OR = 1.3-2.3), a stronger association with the
transition from having a plan to making an attempt
(OR=2.9-7.0), and an even stronger association withmak-
ing an attempt among ideators in the absence of a plan
(OR = 8.0-29.3). There was no significant association be-
tween education and the conditional odds of making a
plan among ideators.
An effort was made to study the predictors of le-
thality of the attempt among attempters. However, the
number of attempters in the NCS was too small to de-
tect meaningful predictors with acceptable statistical
power. It is of special note that neither age of first at-
tempt (2
4
= 3.2; P = .52) nor cohort (2
3
= 5.2; P = .15) was
found to be a significant predictor of lethality, although
caution is needed in interpreting these negative results
because of their low statistical power.
PRIOR DSM-III-R DISORDERS AS RISK FACTORS
Every one of the DSM-III-R disorders assessed in the NCS
was a significant risk factor for a lifetime attempt
(Table 2). However, the ORs for mood disorders (7.8-
29.7) were substantially higher than those for any other
disorders (2.1-6.5). As thoughts of death are included
among the symptoms of major depression, thus creat-
ing the possibility of a confounding effect in predicting
the outcomes, the analysis was also replicated with a modi-
fied definition of major depression that excluded this cri-
terion. The OR increased from 11.0 (95% CI: 7.1-20.3)
in Table 2 to 12.1 (95% CI: 9.3-15.6). Significance of varia-
tion in the effects of aggregate measures of disorders (any
mood disorder, any anxiety disorder, any substance dis-
order, and any other disorder) as a function of both age
(dichotomized at the median age of first attempt) and
cohort was also tested. No significant interactions were
found either with age (2
4
= 5.8; P = .21) or with cohort
(2
12
= 14.1; P = .29). In comparison, 4 significant inter-
actions involved sex: major depression (2
1
=8.1; P=.004),
dysthymia (2
1
=4.5; P=.03), any mood disorder (2
1
=6.7;
P = .01), and simple phobia (2
1
= 8.5; P = .003). The ef-
fect of the disorder was larger among men than among
women in all 4 interactions.

An attempt was also made to evaluate the effects of
comorbidity among disorders in predicting the out-
comes. As shown in the last 4 rows of Table 2, there was
a significant dose-response relationship between num-
ber of prior disorders and odds of attempted suicide. Re-
spondents with 3 or more disorders had relative odds of
an attempt 19.7 times as high as respondents with no dis-
order. However, this result does not control for the main
effects of individual disorders. When an equation was es-
timated that included information about each of the in-
dividual disorders as separate predictors, the incremen-
tal effect of comorbidity was found to be considerably
smaller, although still statistically significant in predict-
ing attempts, with ORs of 3.2 (95% CI: 2.0-5.2) for ex-
actly 2 disorders and 4.1 (95% CI: 2.0-8.3) for 3 or more
disorders. No significant effects of particular bivariate or
multivariate comorbidity were found after controlling for
number of disorders.
Three broad patterns are noteworthy in the path-
ways of the significant associations of prior disorders with
first suicide attempts. First, there were consistently sig-
nificant ORs between all of the disorders and the subse-
quent first onset of suicide ideation. These ORs were much
higher for the mood disorders (7.7-15.5) than for any
other disorders (2.2-5.3) and, within disorder, higher in
predicting ideation than any other pathway for every one
of the disorders. Second, the pathways associated with
the conditional odds of developing a plan among ide-
ators and of making an attempt among ideators without
a plan were consistently greater than 1.0. Furthermore,
ORs were roughly equal in magnitude both when com-
pared across disorders for a particular pathway and when
compared within disorders across pathways. Most of these
ORs were in the range of 1.5 to 3.0. The same patterns
applied to the effects of comorbidity. It is noteworthy that
the much higher ORs associated with mood disorders
found in other parts of the table were not found here,
with the exception of strong ORs for mania with the sub-
sequent occurrence of a plan (OR = 4.0) and an un-
planned attempt (OR = 9.1). Third, the pathway associ-
ated with the conditional odds of making an attempt
among ideators with a plan was generally not signifi-
cant. The only exceptions were the mood disorders
(OR = 1.8-3.2), panic disorder (OR = 2.0), and drug abuse
(OR = 1.3).
As noted above, the sample of attempters was too
small to study the predictors of lethality of the attempt
with good statistical power. However, exploratory analy-
sis shows that seriousness of attempt was positively re-
lated to total number of disorders (2
15
= 34.2; P = .003),
although no particular type of disorder stands out as sig-
nificantly more important than any other in the analysis
of this small subsample of respondents.
COMBINING THE RISK FACTORS
Further analysis shows that the disorders considered in
Table 2 partially explain the effects of the sociodemo-
graphic variables considered in Table 1. This was evalu-
ated in a joint model to predict attempted suicide in the
total sample. Results show that the significant effects of
sex, cohort, and education were attenuated but re-
mained significant when controlling for disorders. The
2 values for the individual predictors decreased from 34.7

cohort, and from 56.7 to 29.4 (P.001) for education.
In comparison, the significant effect of marital status and
near-significant effect of race/ethnicity in Table 1 are
largely explained by mental disorders, with the 2 val-
ues changing from 11.7 to 4.6 (P = .10) for marital sta-
tus and from 7.0 to 1.5 (P = .22) for race/ethnicity.
Survival analysis for all possible subsets was used to
develop a parsimonious risk factor equation for first at-
tempts based on the results of these multivariate models.
The final equation included terms for age 15 to 24 years,
female, most recent cohort, nonstudents with 12 or fewer
years of education, any mood disorder, nonaffective psy-
chosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, any substance dis-
order, and antisocial personality disorder. There was a dra-
matic dose-response relationship between number of risk
factors and relative odds of first suicide attempt (Table 3).

Inspection of the distribution of the summary risk
factor count in the sample of person-years used in the
survival analysis (Table 4) shows that the extremely high
OR of a suicide attempt associated with having 5 or more
risk factors accounts for only 7.0% of the people who made
a lifetime attempt. This is because only a tiny fraction of
the population (0.4%) had this large number of risk fac-
tors. People with 3 or more risk factors, who made up
9.2% of the population, accounted for 55.1% of all people
who made a lifetime suicide attempt.
COMMENT
The results reported here are limited by the fact that the
NCSisacross-sectionalsurveyinwhichinformationabout
lifetime suicide behaviors is based on retrospective re-
ports. Because of this limitation, prevalences are likely
to be lower bound estimates. The estimated effects of co-
hort and other risk factors could be caused, at least in
part, by systematic differences in accuracy of recall re-
lated to these risk factors.36 Furthermore, no reliability
or validity data were obtained on the measures of ide-
ation, plans, attempts, or lethality. Finally, the ability to
study the distribution and predictors of lethality is con-
strained by the fact that the sample excluded people who
completed suicide. This selection bias might account for
the failure to find a significant positive association be-
tween age of first attempt and lethality of intent, an as-
sociation that has been found when both attempters who
died and those who survived have been considered in the
same analysis.37
Within the context of these limitations, the 4.6% es-
timated lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide is above
the high end of the range of estimates reported in pre-
vious US general population surveys.15 Also, the 13.5%
estimated prevalence of suicide ideation is at the high end
oftherangeofpreviousestimates.19,38,39 However,the ques-
tion wording to assess ideation varied in important ways
in earlier surveys,40 sometimes asking about "thoughts"
of suicide,19 "serious" thoughts,39 and "serious thoughts

or plans,"38 making it difficult to make direct compari-
sons with the NCS findings.
There is no basis for comparing the 3.9% estimate
of lifetime plans obtained in the NCS, as, to our knowl-
edge, no previous population surveys assessed plans sepa-
rate from thoughts. The finding that risk of an attempt
was significantly higher among ideators with than with-
out a plan is consistent with previous studies of period
prevalence.9,41 The finding that having a plan was unre-
lated to lethality of intent among attempters is inconsis-
tent with the finding in one previous study that planned
suicide attempts were generally more serious than un-
planned attempts.42
Although, to our knowledge, no previous general
population surveys estimated the age-of-onset distribu-
tion of attempted suicide, related research carried out with
students confirms the NCS finding that risk begins to rise
during the teenage years.10 This is also consistent with
the finding in cross-sectional surveys of adults that pe-
riod prevalence of attempted suicide is inversely related
to age,8 and in longitudinal research that period preva-
lence decreases as a cohort moves into adulthood.9 The
NCS finding of rapid transition from first onset of sui-
cide ideation and plans to attempts cannot be compared
with previous research, as no other population surveys
have examined this issue.
The risk factors considered here were examined in
a survival framework to study the predictors of first
attempts. Previous research has generally studied cross-
sectional associations between current measures of risk
factors and lifetime measures of attempts. This differ-
ence in methods could lead to discrepancies in results.
Therefore, it is striking that most of the NCS risk factor
results are consistent with those found in previous
research. These include the higher lifetime prevalence
of attempted suicide among women than among men,11
the higher prevalence among previously married
people,13 and the inverse association with education,8
although the education association was stronger in the
NCS than in other recent studies.13,14 The significantly
lower odds of an attempt among non-Hispanic blacks
than among whites is consistent with the trend in previ-
ous studies (reviewed by Moscicki15), although some
studies did not find a race difference.13,16 The analysis
fails to replicate the finding of a decrease in the sex dif-
ference over recent cohorts35 or the finding that the pro-
tective effect of being married is reversed among very
young people.12
The NCS provides the first nationally representa-
tive general population data on intercohort difference in
lifetime suicide attempts. This finding is consistent with
independent evidence that could not be explained by a
methodological artifact, including increasing preva-
lences of completed suicide in the United States43 and else-
where44 in recent cohorts and increasing prevalences of
attempted suicide among young people in clinical set-
tings.45-47 To our knowledge, there is no previous re-
search to compare with the findings reported here of in-
significant effects of urbanicity or age of youngest child.
The finding that a substantial part of this cohort effect is
explained by controlling for disorders means that in-
creasing prevalences of mental disorders in recent co-
horts account for most but not all of the cohort effect in
suicide attempts.

*Odds ratios (ORs) were obtained by exponentiating coefficients from discrete-time survival models. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using
the method of Jacknife Repeated Replications to adjust for clustering and weighting of data. The summary risk score is a count of the following risk factors: age
15 to 24 years, female, most recent cohort, nonstudent with 12 or fewer years of education, any mood disorder, nonaffective psychosis, posttraumatic stress
disorder, any substance use disorder (alcohol or drug abuse or dependence), and antisocial personality disorder. A single model was estimated for each of the
5 outcomes, including separate dummy predictor variables for each level of risk. The subsample of respondents with none of the risk factors is the contrast
category.

The strong associations of DSM-III-R disorders with
subsequent attempted suicide and the dose-response rela-
tionship between the number of these disorders and at-
tempts are consistent with other cross-sectional8,19,48 and
longitudinal9,13,18 community epidemiologic surveys. The
finding that mood disorders are stronger predictors than
other mental or substance use disorders is also consistent
with earlier studies. The NCS results do not confirm the
findingsinsomeearlierstudies,however,ofespeciallystrong
effects of substance use disorders,49 antisocial personality
disorder,14 or panic disorder.19 Stronger associations might
have been obtained if the analysis had examined the ef-
fectsofcriticalsymptoms,suchashopelessness,ratherthan
exclusively focusing on diagnoses.
THE FINDING THAT comorbidity is a signifi-
cant predictor of suicide attempts over and
above the effects of individual disorders is
consistent with many recent studies among
both children50,51 and adults.52-54 While
some of these earlier reports suggest a special role of par-
ticular types of comorbidity, none of them controlled rig-
orously for both specific individual disorders and global
patterns of comorbidity (ie, number of disorders). When
such controls were introduced, no special effects of co-
morbidity involving particular disorders were found. To-
tal number of disorders, rather than the types of disor-
ders involved in the comorbidity, were found to be the
strongest predictors of suicide attempts.
The finding that comorbidity is a significant predic-
tor of lethality is also important and is an exception to the
more general failure to document significant predictors of
lethality of intent among attempters in the NCS. This fail-
ure is inconsistent with findings from previous studies that
have documented several significant predictors of lethal-
ity, including having a plan and late age of first attempt,
that were found not to be significant in the NCS.31,33,37,55
As noted above, the low statistical power to study lethal-
ity of intent in the NCS, coupled with the fact that sui-
cide completers were excluded from the analysis, might
account for the failure to replicate these previous find-
ings regarding significant predictors of lethality.
The findings that rapid-onset attempts account for
more than 90% of unplanned first attempts and approxi-
mately two thirds of planned first attempts are in need of
replication in both clinical samples and general popula-
tion samples before they can be accepted. If confirmed,
the finding that the vast majority of unplanned first at-
tempts occur shortly after the onset of suicide ideation
means that efforts to intervene after the onset of ideation
to prevent a first unplanned attempt would be impracti-
cal unless a patient presented for treatment within a year
of first onset of ideation. In cases in which this occurs, the
obvious implications are that the clinician should search
for modifiable risk factors (eg, depression) and should en-
gage in especially aggressive treatment over the high-risk
period of the first year.56,57 As noted by Brent,55 it is also
important to make sure patients at risk of impulsive at-
tempts do not have access to medications that can be used
to make a suicide attempt, as risk of unplanned attempts
may be increased by easy access to such agents.
The only potentially realistic high-risk population
prevention efforts aimed at first suicide attempts after the
first year of ideation would deal with planned attempts.
The retrospective NCS results suggest that approxi-
mately one half of the people in the general population
with a history of a suicide plan who do not make an at-
tempt during their first year of ideation make an at-
tempt at some later date. The combination of high con-
ditional risk and a long risk period in a fairly small
proportion of the population (about 2% of the popula-
tion in recent cohorts) makes it likely that focused in-
terventions in this subgroup would be cost-effective.
The risk factors considered in this report are more
directly related to first attempts among ideators with a
plan than to unplanned attempts. This can be seen most
clearly in Table 3, where the OR comparing the highest-
and lowest-risk groups is 2.3 for predicting a first at-
tempt among ideators with a plan compared with be-
tween 10.8 and 115.2 for the other pathways in the table.
Clearly, if effective interventions to prevent first at-
tempts among ideators with a plan are to be developed,
they will need to go beyond the standard set of risk fac-
tors considered in the current report and elsewhere in
the literature to gain insights into possible intervention
targets in this high-risk segment of the population.
