Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether physicians who felt strongly for or against a treatment, in
this case a moderately life prolonging non-curative cancer treatment, differed in their estimation of medical indication for
this treatment as compared to physicians who had no such sentiment. A further aim was to investigate how the notion of
medical indication was conceptualised.
Methods: A random sample of GPs, oncologists and pulmonologists (n ¼ 646) comprised the study group. Respondents
were randomised to receive either version of a case presentation; in one version, the patient had smoked and in the
other version she had never smoked. The physicians were labelled value-neutral (65%) and value-influenced (35%) on the
basis of their attitude towards the treatment.
Results: In the `value-influenced' group, there was a significant difference in the estimation of medical indication for
treatment depending upon whether the patient had smoked (50% (95% CI: 41­59) or never smoked (67% (95% CI: 58­76)
(Chi-2 ¼ 5.8, df ¼ 1; p ¼ 0.016)). There was no such difference in the `value-neutral' group.
Conclusion: This study shows that compared to value-neutral physicians,value-influencedphysicians are more likely to base
decisions of medical indication on medically irrelevant factors (in this case: the patient's smoking status). Moreover, medical
indication is used in an ambiguous manner. Hence, we recommend that the usage of `medical indication' be disciplined.

Introduction
In a medicolegal case where a man has injured his knee at
work, a physician (an orthopaedic surgeon) provides the
following testimony: `Given the mechanical symptoms of
catching andlock, his failure to progress with rest, a home
exercise program and anti-inflammatories it is medically
indicated to proceed with right knee arthroscopy'.1 At
first glance, a statement such as this ­ especially made
by a specialised physician in the setting of a court case ­
may seem persuasively objective and straight-forward. In
this paper, however, we will argue that it may be neither
of those two things. We want to point out that our aim is
not to discredit this individual physician nor to further
comment on that particular case, but rather to focus on
the role that physicians' private values may play in fram-
ing and understanding the concept of medical indication
in a wide variety of clinical settings.
Health care is, by necessity, a value-laden enter-
prise. Like any institution that purports to achieve
something (in this case: improved health), it shows
already by this intention that its actions are at least
partly governed by values. In striving towards
improved health for patients, health care thus presup-
poses that improved health is desirable. This also goes
for those working within health care: a physician who
does not value good health above bad health and ben-
evolence above malevolence would seem badly suited
for his/her job.

One common view holds that the most important
values in health care are autonomy, benevolence, non--
maleficence and justice.2 Although controversies
regarding these `four principles' remain, these values
have become so accepted that they now form part of
some health care systems' official regulation.3 In the
following, we will refer to these as the `official values'
of health care.
At least two of the above-mentioned values (benevo-
lence and non-maleficence) are directly relevant to the
concept of medical indication. Judging that a procedure
is medically indicated for a patient is in itself an evalu-
ative process, as the physician balances the individual
patient's health impairment versus the achievable
health improvement and the possible side effects.4
If the achievable health improvement is sufficiently
large and the possible side effects sufficiently small,
the beneficence and non-maleficence principles would
indeed support the physician's judgment of a specific
medical treatment as `medically indicated'.
However, since physicians are human beings it
cannot be taken for granted that they all fully share
the official values. It is reasonable to expect that some
of them hold certain private value convictions that may
be in conflict with the official values. In the following,
we will call such convictions `private values', as
opposed to `official values' which will be used for
values conforming to the ethical principles mentioned
above, regardless of whether these are shared by indi-
vidual physicians or not.
Ethical problems may result if any physician's pri-
vate values differ considerably from the official values.
If physicians are allowed to act on such private values,
predictability and transparency may be impaired,
which, in turn, might undermine patients' potential to
make informed health care choices. To avoid this, many
health care systems have checks and balances to limit
the scope of physicians' fancies. Indeed, health care
legislation and ethical codes of conduct are often
based upon the official values mentioned above, striving
to bar influence by physicians' private values in the
sense we have defined them. In Sweden, there is a
long positivist tradition where civil servants such as
physicians are assumed to be neutral administrators
of official guidelines and values.5 This is illustrated,
for instance, by the fact that there is no room for con-
scientious objections in the Swedish healthcare system.
Ideals and regulations such as these in themselves work
to prevent physicians acting on the basis of their own
whims.
However, there is a body of empirical studies suggest-
ing that despite all checks and balances physicians'
private values do sometimes enter clinical practice impli-
citly or `through the back door'. 6 This expression refers
to a cognitive process described by, among others,
Molewijk et al.7 who dubbed it `implicit normativity'.
Molewijk et al.7 describe how private values affect clin-
ical practice by informing physicians' impression of, and
communication regarding, the factual basis of medical
decisions. As the physicians' private values are hidden in
the presentation of factual aspects of the situation, they
can effectually become `invisible' to all parties (including
even the physicians themselves). The issue has been fur-
ther investigated by Juth and Lynoe.8 who have instead
used the term `value impregnation' of factual aspects.
This term indicates that the factual aspects of a deci-
sion-making process may be more or less impregnated
by a physician's private values. Take, for instance,
a physician who is privately in favour of physician-
assisted suicide (PAS), but works in a setting where
PAS is not permitted. When faced with a dying patient
in pain, this physician may ­ by route of conscious or
unconscious value impregnation ­ make a factual over-
estimation of the patient's pain, leading to the adminis-
tration of possibly lethal doses of pain relief. Conversely,
a physician who does not support PAS may in the same
situation underestimate the pain, leading to possibly
insufficient doses of pain relief.9
When physicians' private values impregnate factual
aspects of medical decisions, this can lead to several
problems. First, it may compromise patients' auton-
omy.6 Obviously, the more biased the physician's infor-
mation to the patient is, the harder it will be for the
patient to reach a decision in the light of her own values
and wishes.2 (Conflicts with patient autonomy may of
course arise even relative to the `official values', but this
is beyond the scope of the present study.) Secondly, if
physicians' private values implicitly affect the clinical
decision-making process, the choice of clinical examin-
ations and treatments offered to the patient will be
dependent upon these values. This may lead to arbi-
trariness, which is clearly in conflict with the so-called
formal principle of justice (i.e. that relevantly equal
cases should be treated equally), and by extension
with the health care codex in several countries, for
instance Sweden.10
Unlike physicians' private values, it is commonly
accepted that the patient's private values should be
accounted for in the medical decision-making process.11
As individuals differ, so patients differ in attitudes to
treatment as well as in their preferred levels of infor-
mation and risk taking. Such attitudes may, in line with
the autonomy principle (an official value), legitimately
affect how and which decisions are ultimately made.
However, it is unclear whether such patient values are
internal or external to the concept of medical indica-
tion. For instance, can a patient's strong desire for a
treatment constitute or augment a medical indication
for that treatment? There seems to be no consensus on
this issue. The Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary
Bjo
¨rk et al. 191
simply defines medical indication as `a symptom or par-
ticular circumstance that indicates the advisability or
necessity of a specific medical treatment or proced-
ure',12 giving no clue as to what these circumstances
may be. In clinical practice, physicians sometimes
speak of two kinds of indications: medical indications
on the one hand and `non-medical indications',
`extended indications', `social indications' or `humani-
tarian indications' on the other hand. Although the
latter kind of indications may be invoked in any med-
ical setting, they seem to be most often used in ethically
complex medical situations such as beginning-of-life
issues, life style questions or issues in palliative care.
Some examples are abortions, sterilisations,
Caesarean delivery on maternal request, sedation-ther-
apy on request at the end of life and certain plastic-
surgery operations (e.g. culturally motivated hymen
restorations).9,13
The present paper rests on two hypotheses. The first
is that ­ in contrast to perceptions of the physician as
an impartial administrator of official values ­ phys-
icians' private values do sometimes affect medical deci-
sion making. The second is that the concept of medical
indication is unclear and that different physicians may
mean quite different things when they use the term.14 In
the following, we will try to specify how the uses may
differ and what implications these differences may have,
especially in regards to value impregnation of medical
indications associated with priority setting.
We have previously conducted an experimental
study among Swedish physicians using a randomised
controlled design. The results indicated that although
most physicians stated that patients should not be held
responsible for their conditions, a significantly larger
proportion of physicians were inclined to offer a new
and expensive treatment to a non-smoking lung-cancer
patient than to a smoking lung-cancer patient.15 For
the present paper, we used the same set of data to inves-
tigate whether the participating physicians estimate the
medical indication for treatment differently depending
upon the patient's smoking status, which would suggest
that the concept of medical indication is open to value-
impregnation. Also, we wanted to examine how the
physicians accounted for their judgments of medical
indication, again with a special eye to possible value
impregnation of this concept.
Methods
The questionnaires
Respondents were randomised to receive one of two
versions of a questionnaire containing a case
description of a female 59-year-old lung-cancer patient.
The two versions were identical but for one factor: in
one version, the patient was a current smoker with a 40
pack-year smoking history, whereas in the other ver-
sion, she had never smoked.15 By using this design,
inspired by studies by Joshua Knobe,16 we aimed at
capturing possible differences in response patterns
attributable to the patients' smoking status. In the
case description, it was stated that the patient had
incurable, disseminated lung cancer, but that a novel
treatment could prolong her life approximately
10 weeks. However, the treatment was stated to be
expensive and not routinely offered. The questionnaires
then posed the questions whether or not there was a
medical indication to offer the new treatment, and
whether the respondents thought that the treatment
should be offered (response options to both questions:
yes/no).
The respondents were further asked whether their
own trust in health care would be affected if this kind
of treatment was routinely offered (response options:
decrease/not change/increase). Those who claimed
that their trust would increase or decrease were classi-
fied as value-influenced, and those who claimed their
trust would not be affected were classified as value-
neutral. The rationale for this dichotomisation was
the assumption that those who said their trust would
decrease or increase thereby expressed an evaluation of
the act in question (i.e. to offer or not offer treatment).
Physicians who said their trust would decrease if the
treatment were to be offered were thus interpreted to
clearly oppose the routine offering of this treatment
(and conversely). The group who, in contrast, reported
their trust would not be changed if the treatment was to
be routinely offered were interpreted to find this pro-
spect neither good nor bad.13
Participants
The study group in the present analysis included a
random sample of 1200 physicians (mainly oncologists,
pulmonologists and GPs) of which 646 responded,
giving a response rate of 53.8%. The random samples
were drawn from a commercial database (Cegedim/
Stockholm) and came from all over Sweden. The par-
ticipants were 30­78 years (mean: 56 years) and the sex
balance was 52% male and 48% female respondents.
Randomisation and blinding
The two versions of the questionnaire were randomly
distributed to all participants by paper mail, including
two reminders. The randomisation was executed by
192 Clinical Ethics 11(4)
allotting each participant a list number, giving all even
numbers `the smoking patient version' and all odd
numbers `the non-smoking patient version'. The ran-
domisation procedure resulted in two groups which
was similar in all relevant aspects, results which have
been presented elsewhere.15 In the introductory letter,
there was no mention of another version of the case
presentation. Thus, the design of the experiment was
blinded to the respondents.
Analysis
Chi-2 test was used to analyse contingency tables.
The results were presented as proportion with 95%
confidence interval (CI). Logistic regression analysis
was performed in order to study associations between
the dichotomous main outcome variable and the inde-
pendent variables that might influence the outcome.
We also included interactions in the logistic model to
test for non-additivity of the independent variables.
A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The data were registered and analysed using the Epi-
info software 6.04 as well as SASÕ System 9.4, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.
When analysing the comments, we used a
modified version of content analysis17 focusing on the
respondents' stated reasons in support of their judg-
ment of medical indication. We also tried to divide
the reasons into factually based reasons and value-
based reasons.
Ethics
All respondents were informed about the study's pur-
pose and voluntary nature in a simple, comprehensible
language. However, the Joshua Knobe-inspired method
which effectively conceals the specific research aim from
the respondents entails an ethical dilemma common to
all partly deceptive research methods. In brief, the
dilemma is that the respondents are asked to participate
under auspices that do not exactly match the real pur-
pose of the study.
The study protocol was approved by the Stockholm
Regional research ethics committee (Dnr 2014/344-
31/2).
Results
When comparing the physicians who received the
non-smoking patient version of the questionnaire and
the physicians who received the smoking patient
version, the first group tended to be more inclined to
offer the proposed treatment than the second group
(57.3% vs. 52%). This difference, however, was not
significant (Chi-2 ¼ 1.78; df ¼ 1, p ¼ 0.18).
In order to further analyse the data, we divided
the physicians into the above-mentioned categories
of value-influenced and value-neutral physicians.
Under this definition, 65% (n ¼ 393) were classified as
`value-neutral' and the remaining 35% (n ¼ 207) were
classified as `value-influenced'. There was no statistical
difference in the relative proportions of the value-neutral
to the value-influenced physicians among those who
had received the smoking and non-smoking patient
version of the questionnaire.
Among the value-influenced physicians, 67% (95%
CI: 58­76) stated that there was a medical indication
for treating the non-smoking lung-cancer patient, while
50% (95% CI: 41-59) found a medical indication for
treating the smoking patient (Chi-2 ¼ 5.8, df ¼ 1;
p ¼ 0.016). Among value-neutral physicians, the corres-
ponding proportions were 53% in both groups
(95% CI: 46­60) (Chi-2 ¼ 0.003, df ¼ 1; p ¼ 0.96) ­ see
Table 1.
We also used the dichotomy of value-influenced and
value-neutral to compare the two groups' inclinations
to offer treatment. This analysis showed that 78%

opposed to 57% (95% CI: 48­66) in regards to the
smoking patient (Chi-2 ¼ 11.19, df ¼ 1; p ¼ 0.001).
Among the value-neutral, the corresponding propor-
tions were 70% (95% CI: 64­76) versus 67% (95%
CI: 60­74); (Chi-2 ¼ 0.376, df ¼ 1; p ¼ 0.540). Please
see Table 1.
Analysing the relationship between physicians' esti-
mation of medical indication and their inclination to
treat the patient, we found that among those who
found a medical indication for treatment, 92% (95%
CI: 89­95) were inclined to offer treatment, whereas
among those who found no medical indication for
treatment, 38% (95% CI: 32­44) were inclined to
offer treatment.
We also analysed the comments to the question of
whether there was a medical indication to offer treatment.
A wide range of arguments/reasons were offered in
support of the estimations of a medical indication for
treatment. There were no systematic differences in argu-
ments between respondents of the two versions of the
questionnaire. Please see Table 2.
Discussion
The empirical results
In the whole group of physicians studied, there was no
difference in the perception of medical indication for
treatment depending upon the patient's smoking
status. However, when the group was divided into
those who seemed to hold an evaluative stance in
regards to the proposed treatment (pro or contra) and
those who seemed to be value neutral in regards to the
proposed treatment, we found a significant difference.
The 35% of the physicians who were classified as value-
influenced, unlike their value-neutral counterparts, dis-
criminated between the non-smoking and the smoking
patient in their estimations of medical indication for
treatment as well as their inclination to offer the treat-
ment. The 65% who were classified as value-neutral, on
the contrary, did not discriminate between the smoking
and non-smoking patient on either account. In this,
they acted in accordance with the Swedish official
values, which stress that patients' previous behaviour
should not influence access to treatment.

Molewijk et al.7 claim that all physicians' decisions
are more or less influenced by official as well as private
values. If the distinction between value-influenced and
value-neutral physicians is plausible, it can be argued
that at least in this setting the majority of the physicians
seem not to let private values influence their estimation
of the medical indication for the proposed treatment
and their inclination to offer the treatment. Whether
this is because they discipline their potential subjectiv-
ity, or whether as a matter of fact they do not hold any
strong private values regarding the proposed treatment,
cannot be assessed in the study. It should also be borne
in mind that previous studies suggest that the relative
proportions of value-neutral to value-influenced phys-
icians might depend upon the level of controversy sur-
rounding the issue in question.6,18
Since the smoking patient questionnaire and the
non-smoking patient questionnaire differed solely on
the point of the patient's smoking status, which in
turn was framed as being of no prognostic relevance,
the results indicate that the value-influenced physicians
incorporate medically irrelevant aspects in their assess-
ment of medical indication for treatment. In this par-
ticular study, such aspects would be biases against
smoking patients. We suggest that these physicians'
assessment of the factual aspects of medical indication
could be value-impregnated. As nearly all participating
physicians stated that patients' responsibility should
not count when deciding whether or not the patient
should be offered a new and expensive treatment, it
may be that some physicians' private values were tacitly
and unconsciously brought in `through the back-door'.6
We suggest that the back door metaphor might be
interpreted as private values impregnating the estima-
tions of factual aspects of `medical indication'.
The impregnation procedure might be unconscious and
invisible both for the participants themselves and others
concerned. In this way, the physicians are seemingly not
acting against the official values, but our applied experi-
mental design makes it possible to reveal the procedure
and the concealed agenda behind it.
Qualitative and philosophical analysis of
medical indication
The empirical results provide some clues on how to
analyse the concept of medical indication. As noted in
the introduction, different people can mean different
things when they say there is a medical indication for
treatment. We propose that this is due to two different
but related conceptual unclarities: firstly, the unclarity
regarding the concept of medical indication itself, and
secondly the unclarity regarding the conceptual relation
between finding a medical indication for treatment and
actually offering this treatment.
At its analytical core,19 the concept of `medical indi-
cation' for a treatment seems to presuppose or establish
only that there is evidence to show that the treatment is
effective and reasonably safe. This is supported by the
lexical Merriam-Webster definition of medical indica-
tion, which states that a treatment is medically indicated
when advisable or necessary. Thus, it is reasonable to
expect that when physicians claim a treatment is medic-
ally indicated, they mean at least that medical evidence
backs its usage. Indeed, the comments in our data
showed many physicians explaining their judgment of
medical indication along these lines, e.g. `if there is med-
ical evidence for treatment, there is a medical indication'.
Although consistent with the analytical core, many
other comments showed that many respondents also
included non-medical/extended considerations into the
notion of medical indication itself, e.g. `medically indi-
cated so she can live past her grandchild's birthday'.
Thus, it seems that whereas some physicians consider
the above-mentioned reference to evidence of effect as a
sufficient and necessary reason for judging that there is
a medical indication for treatment, others see reference
to evidence of effect as insufficient for medical indi-
cation. It was not clear from our data whether these
physicians also consider it unnecessary. However, the
absence of comments implying that the treatment was
effective and reasonably safe, but still not medically
indicated, seems to speak against this. All in all, the
comments supported the hypothesis that there is great
ambiguity regarding the interpretation of `medical indi-
cation', and that some physicians have a much broader
view of the concept.
The second conceptual unclarity concerns the rela-
tionship between medical indication and the physician's
inclination to treat. Two of this paper's three authors
are physicians, and our clinical experience is that when
physicians speak of something being medically indi-
cated, they are doing more than making a factual
claim. This point can be analysed by reference to the
concept of `conversational implicature' from the field of
language philosophy.
The conversational implicature of a statement is
what the statement could be taken to mean, when the
full context of the situation is accounted for.20 Often,
this amounts to much more than what is literally being
said. If, for instance, I ask you if I can come around this
afternoon and you answer `I will be at home', I may be
justified in thinking you did not merely offer me infor-
mation about where you will be this afternoon, but
rather that we have made a date of sorts. In much the
same way, a physician saying `there is a medical indi-
cation for treatment' will often be interpreted, by con-
versational implicature, as meaning `treatment should
be offered' or, at least, `there is a reason to offer treat-
ment'. However, although related, these propositions
Bjo
¨rk et al. 195
are not necessarily synonymic or extensionally equiva-
lent. Conceptually, the correlation between what a
physician means when s/he claims there is a medical
indication to offer treatment and that s/he is inclined
to offer treatment can be illustrated thus:
Indeed, the results of this study can be interpreted as
showing support among physicians for all four views
described above. Analysis of the comments gave further
corroboration of this hypothesis. Returning again to
those physicians who seem to equate medical indication
with what we called the concept's minimal interpret-
ation (reference to efficacy and safety), most displayed
a correspondence between their judgment of the treat-
ment's efficacy and their judgment of whether treatment
should be given. Thus, most of those who saw the treat-
ment as efficient were inclined to offer treatment, and
most who saw treatment as ineffective were disinclined
to offer treatment. We propose that at least some of
these efficacy-determined physicians adhere to position
1 above, making a strong link between medical indica-
tion and offering treatment.
If the existence of position 1 physicians was only
indirectly suggested by the results, there were very
many comments that clearly expressed support for pos-
itions 2 or 4 (possibly also 3). In regards to the first
unclarity mentioned above, these physicians seem to let
humanitarian considerations remain external to the
understanding of medical indication proper, but still
influence the choice to offer treatment. One example
of many such comments was: `not medically indicated
but we have to show empathy'.
The results also indicated that some physicians who
judged there was a medical indication for treatment
nevertheless opted not to offer treatment. In the scheme
above, that would put them in position 4. All comments
from that group regarding why they would not offer
treatment concerned cost efficacy: `prioritizations are
necessary"; "resources should be put to better use'.
Obviously, positions 2 and 3 are `including' in the
sense that they lead to more patients being offered treat-
ment than only those with a firm medical indication
(under all interpretations of that concept). In contrast,
position 4 is "excluding" as opposing reasons can sub-
tract from the medical indication to lead to a situation
where treatment is not offered despite there being a med-
ical indication. As seen in the comments, the reasons for
not giving the treatment may be prioritisation consider-
ations in a situation of economy shortage.
Summing up so far, we have described two concep-
tually different ways by which physicians include other
aspects than the purely medical ones (i.e. efficacy,
safety, and evidence) in treatment decisions. The first
way is to expand the notion of medical indication to
encompass for instance humanitarian issues. The
second way is to keep the notion of medical indication
free from such issues, but base treatment decisions on a
range of indications.
We would like to point out that both of these prac-
tices may be in conflict with established systems for
health care prioritisation. In Sweden, for instance, the
health care law stipulates that all priority setting deci-
sions should conform to the principles of human dignity,
needs and solidarity and cost efficacy.3 As can be seen,
there is no officially sanctioned principle that regulates
priority for patients with `non-medical' indications. In
theory, it could be argued that extended/humanitarian
aspects fall under the needs principle above, but this is
not uncontested.10 Thus, under the current Swedish
health law, humanitarian aspects have an unclear stand-
ing in priority setting situations, and any physician who

frequently treats patients on a humanitarian indication
may by opportunity cost decrease health access for
patients managed by other physicians who do not base
their treatment on this principle.13 Thus, pending a
philosophically sound work-up of the place of humani-
tarian indications within the hierarchy of prioritisation,
it is probably wise to use this principle with moderation.
Some apparent contradictions among the respond-
ents' comments also merit mention. For instance, there
was great variance in the responses to issues of prog-
nosis and expected survival time. Many physicians who
found a medical indication for treatment pointed out
that the patient `seemed healthy' and might live longer
than the expected survival time on the proposed treat-
ment. On the other hand, physicians who did not find a
medical indication pointed out she `seemed very ill' and
might live shorter. In fact, the text in the vignette pro-
vided very little clues to how `healthy' she was, other
than the fact that without treatment she would likely
die within three weeks. As for the survival on treatment,
deviations from the mean are of course possible in both
directions. It is also an open question what constitutes
`sufficient' time to merit treatment. (However, one
respondent actually provided a clear answer to this,
commenting: `one month is clinically significant time'.)
These findings give rise to the question: did the phys-
ician start with an inclination to treat and adjust his/her
judgment of expected time accordingly, or did the judg-
ment of time provide basis for the inclination to treat?
As our results cannot answer this question, we do not
claim that these response patterns prove that phys-
icians' value impregnate their perceptions of survival
time. But the finding that some physicians used the
patient's smoking status as basis for the medical indi-
cation indicates that there is a risk of value impregna-
tion, and the judgment of expected survival time is a
judgment that may easily be impregnated.
On the same note, we found it interesting that some
respondents who denied there being a medical indica-
tion for treatment claimed there was insufficient evi-
dence for treatment. In fact, the questionnaire clearly
stated that the proposed treatment had been thor-
oughly studied. Obviously, this is an area where value
impregnation can have far-reaching implications. To
the critical-minded, it is almost always possible to
claim there is insufficient evidence: most bodies of evi-
dence contain contradictions and controversies. Thus,
whenever a physician does not want to offer treatment,
s/he can offer lack of evidence or `insufficient' expected
survival time as reasons for not offering treatment.
Implications of the study
If a physician's anti-smoker bias determines patients'
access to treatment by affecting how the physician
estimates a patients' medical indications for treatment
­ as this study has indicated ­ this is bad news for
individual patients as well as for justice in health
care priority setting. It is bad news because whether
or not such a patient will receive treatment will
depend on the private values of the decision-making
physician. In other words, it becomes arbitrary whether
or not such a patient will be offered the treatment.
Matters are further complicated by the fact that
such value-impregnation may be partly unconscious.
In a recent study of decision-making capacity evalu-
ations in Switzerland, Hermann et al.6 found that a
quarter of the studied physicians, when asked openly,
stated that their own values influenced their evalu-
ations, while equally many claimed that their own
values had no effect at all. One way to raise awareness
of this potential problem could be for clinicians to rou-
tinely question and discuss underlying evaluative forces
in clinical decision making. This is probably most
important when the issue at stake is controversial or
value-laden, as when involving smoking patients.
Further empirical studies are needed to show how
such awareness-raising activities may be arranged in
the clinical setting.
As indicated by our discussion above, there seems to
be no agreement among physicians as to what is meant
by `medical indication'. This ambiguity increases the risk
of value-impregnation, and we therefore propose
that the medical community should be more careful
when using this concept. While there is no way to
ensure a terminology free from value-impregnation, the
ambiguity can be partly avoided if physicians reserve the
moniker `medical indication for treatment' for what we
have called its analytical core or minimal interpretation
(the claim that evidence shows the treatment is effective
and safe enough), and call other indications (social,
humanitarian etc.) by another name. Furthermore, we
recommend that physicians reflect about how and when
their own private values influence decision-making
explicitly or implicitly, for instance through value
impregnation of supposedly `hard' facts. The British
ethicist Martyn Pickersgill21 writes of `the essential
entanglement of the moral and the factual' and as we
do not see any way to permanently disentangle the fac-
tual from the moral, we hope instead that this paper may
be a starting-point for a discussion about that very
entanglement.
Another practical implication of this study is
the following: if there is disagreement between phys-
icians (or physicians and patients) in a decision-
making situation, it may be helpful to first examine
whether the disagreement is based on the judgment of
factual aspects and, if so, also examine whether this
difference may depend on possible value-
impregnations.

Strengths and weaknesses
The obvious strength of this study is its randomised,
controlled design. This method yields robust data and
in this setting allowed us to examine the effect played by
the patient's smoking status on the estimation of med-
ical indication. As the randomisation process resulted
in comparable groups regarding relevant aspects, the
design minimised the risk of bias.
However, due to the relatively low response rate, we
cannot know to what degree the results are generalisable
at least regarding the proportions of those who are
value-neutral and value-influenced. Comments made
by the respondents indicate that some physicians found
the case description over simplified, which could be a
reason for the low response rate.
The respondents' answering patterns and com-
ments raised a wealth of philosophical questions, pri
marily concerning the notion of `medical indication'.
Therefore, we set out to investigate this topic in a
long discussion section. By necessity in a mixed empir-
ical/philosophical paper such as this, the philosophical
analysis to some extent goes `beyond' what can be
strictly inferred from the empirical material. We thus
wish to point out that the final interpretative result is
our estimation of a best guess, and that we welcome
alternative interpretations to the matter.
In this paper, the group labelled `value-influenced
physicians' were those whose trust in health care would
be altered ­ for better or worse ­ if the proposed therapy
was to become routinely used. The underlying assumption
is that such an alteration of trust implies that the respond-
ents feel that important health care values are truly at
stake in this issue, in a way that the value-neutral phys-
icians do not. Thus, it is only in regards to the adoption of
the proposed treatment as routine that value-neutral
physicians are indicated to be value-neutral. Outside
of that, they may very well harbour for instance strong
liberal and humanitarian values that are in accordance
with the official values. What is of concern here is, then,
a very limited interpretation of the term `value-neutral'.
This interpretation is furthermore our own and its validity
needs to be scrutinised further.
Finally, we wish to point out that in the qualitative
analysis, the counting of comments is not intended to
give an estimation of the relative frequency of certain
opinions in the entire set of data. As only a minority of
respondents commented on their responses, the com-
ments can only give clues on how to interpret the
rationales for understanding medical indication in the
studied group.
Conclusion
This study indicates that approximately a third of the
studied physicians let their private values influence the
judgement of whether or not to offer treatment to a
smoking lung-cancer patient, and their estimation of
the medical indication for such treatment. In contrast,
the majority of the studied physicians either held no bias
against smokers, or were able to keep such private values
out of the medical decision-making process, and hence
made more fair decisions ­ or at least decisions that were
in accordance with official Swedish health care norms.
Our analysis of the concept of medical indication
highlights three problems with this concept. First,
that although physicians and patients may not realise
this, stating that a treatment is `medically indicated' is
by definition an evaluative endeavour. Second, that the
term is plagued by conceptual unclarity. Third, that
physicians sometimes­ deleteriously ­ seem to involve
private values such as bias against smoking in estima-
tions of medical indication for treatment. To ameliorate
these problems, we suggest that physicians engage in
discussions regarding the official and possible private
value base of decisions, and that the term medical indi-
cation be reserved for statements about evidence of effi-
cacy and safety of treatment only.
