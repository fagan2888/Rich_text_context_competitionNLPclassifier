What explains why people in the same society perceive var-
ying levels of corruption? Individuals often perceive the
same phenomenon differently, whether it is the health of the
economy (Duch et al., 2000) or the number of war casualties
(Berinsky, 2007). Perceptions of corruption should be no
different, particularly since corruption is an illicit phenom-
enon that is typically concealed and therefore difficult to
measure. Most explanations privilege attitudes and predis-
positions, such as partisanship (Anduiza et al., 2013; Davis
et al., 2004), support for the incumbent government
(Tverdova, 2011), levels of trust (Cover, 2007; Uslaner,
2008), and ideological leanings (Razafindrakoto and
Roubaud, 2010). In this article, we focus on socioeconomic
status, a variable directly related to corruption's ill effects.
We hypothesize that those who are most harmed by corrup-
tion, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, will tend to per-
ceive higher levels of corruption. Using surveys from
dozens of countries and multiple data sources, we find
robust evidence in support of this hypothesis, but only in
advanced countries. In lower- and middle-income countries,
the negative relationship between socioeconomic status and
corruption perceptions is weaker and less consistent.
Understanding how socioeconomic status relates to cor-
ruption perceptions is important for two reasons. First, absent
high-quality cross-national indicators of corruption, scholars
frequently use perception-based measures as proxies for
actual corruption. Knowing how and why corruption percep-
tions systematically vary across individuals is essential for
understanding potential biases in these perception-based
measures. Second, identifying who in a society perceives
more or less corruption matters because perceptions moti-
vate behavior, irrespective of their accuracy (Gerber and
Huber, 2009). Beliefs that corruption is widespread diminish
trust in government and other members of society (Chang
and Chu, 2006; Rothstein and Eek, 2009), discourage politi-
cal participation (Cover, 2007), and influence vote choice
(Slomczynski and Shabad, 2012). Thus, knowing which
socioeconomic groups are likely to perceive more corruption
can shed light on patterns of mass political behavior and
explain why a phenomenon like corruption might affect vari-
ous segments of the population differently.
The unequal effects of corruption
Most commonly defined as the "the misuse of public office
for private gain" (Treisman, 2000: 399), corruption com-
prises a variety of behaviors, including when politicians and
bureaucrats steal money and resources from public coffers,
demand remuneration from citizens in return for special

Abstract
Why do citizens vary in their perceptions about the frequency of corruption? We hypothesize that those most harmed
by corruption--the socioeconomically disadvantaged--should perceive corruption to be more frequent. Using multiple
cross-national surveys, we find that the poor and the uneducated tend to perceive higher levels of corruption than the
wealthy and the well educated. However, this relationship only holds in countries at high levels of economic development.
In poorer countries, the statistical relationship is much weaker and sometimes runs in the opposite direction.

favors, or make the provision of government goods and ser-
vices conditional on the receipt of bribes or votes. Scholars
further distinguish between grand corruption and petty cor-
ruption (Bussell, 2012; Uslaner, 2008). Whereas petty cor-
ruptionoccursinthecourseofcitizens'everydaytransactions
with the state, grand corruption typically involves large
sums of money and the participation of high-level bureau-
crats, politicians, and businesspeople.
Previous research has argued that corruption dispropor-
tionately harms the socioeconomically disadvantaged, as it
exacerbates existing inequalities (Gupta et al., 2002;
Johnston, 1989; Mauro, 1995; Tanzi, 1998; Uslaner, 2008).
At an aggregate level, corruption causes higher levels of
income inequality and poverty (Gupta et al., 2002), which
are likely to exert the greatest toll on those who are already
poor. More specifically, petty corruption harms the socio-
economically disadvantaged because the poor are less able
to pay bribes that are required to access public services.
Furthermore, petty corruption harms citizens with little
education because they are less knowledgeable about how
the bureaucracy works and potential recourse should they
find themselves asked for bribes, thus making them easy
targets for corrupt officials. Grand corruption also harms
the poor disproportionately. When corrupt officials steal
public funds or the wealthy pay bribes to avoid paying
taxes, the state has fewer resources to spend on programs
that benefit the poor, such as primary education and welfare
services. Bribes to legislators can produce public policy
that disproportionately benefits the privileged, such as
through a regressive taxation system. Finally, grand corrup-
tion can exact a non-material harm on the socioeconomi-
cally disadvantaged by corroborating beliefs that the
political system is stacked against them, thereby diminish-
ing their feelings of trust in the political system and their
perceptions of the system's efficacy.
Given the disproportionate harm that the socioeconomi-
cally disadvantaged suffer from corruption, we hypothesize
that they should perceive higher levels of corruption. In
particular, the poor and the uneducated should perceive
higher levels of corruption than the wealthy and the well
educated. This is not to say that the disadvantaged neces-
sarily experience corruption more often (though they
might), but rather that they are disproportionately harmed
by corruption.
At least three mechanisms explain why disproportionate
harm should translate into higher levels of perceived cor-
ruption among the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The
first involves the resolution of cognitive dissonance
(Festinger, 1957). If corruption does someone great harm
and she consequently cares deeply about it, she may over-
estimate the frequency of corruption in order to justify her
preoccupation with it. The second mechanism involves the
selective consumption of information on corruption. Just as
people selectively expose themselves to information that
reinforces existing political attitudes (Stroud, 2008), they
may pay greater attention to information that confirms their
beliefs about the gravity of corruption. Knowing that cor-
ruption harms them disproportionately, the disadvantaged
may pay more attention to information about corruption
and therefore recall more instances of it than more socio-
economically advantaged citizens. Finally, the third mecha-
nism involves distinct conceptions of corruption. Citizens
of lower socioeconomic status often take a more expansive
view of corruption that encompasses a broad range of
unethical, but often legal, behaviors in which certain people
benefit from favoritism (Johnston, 1986; Redlawsk and
McCann, 2005). What the privileged see as normal politics,
the disadvantaged may see as corrupt. If those who do not
benefit from favoritism treat a wider range of behaviors as
corrupt, then they should perceive higher levels of corrup-
tion than those who define corruption more narrowly. If, for
these reasons, the disadvantaged indeed perceive higher
levels of corruption, then an individual's income and edu-
cation should be negatively associated with her beliefs
about corruption's pervasiveness.
So far, relatively little empirical research has focused on
the relationship between socioeconomic status and percep-
tions of corruption. Studies that include income and educa-
tion as predictors of corruption perceptions (often as
controls) usually examine one or a handful of countries and
have arrived at mixed findings.1 Some have found that the
wealthy (Davis et al., 2004) and educated (Olken, 2009)
perceive more corruption, while others find no relationship
(Cover, 2007) or that the wealthy and educated perceive
less corruption (Redlawsk and McCann, 2005; Tverdova,
2011). By simultaneously analyzing surveys from dozens
of countries and multiple data sources, we aim to uncover
broader patterns in the association between socioeconomic
status and corruption perceptions.
Data
To examine whether socioeconomically disadvantaged citi-
zens tend to perceive higher levels of corruption, we use
cross-country surveys that ask citizens how they evaluate
corruption's frequency in their countries. Specifically, we
use Module 2 of the Comparative Study of Electoral
Systems (CSES), Wave 3 of the World Values Survey
(WVS), and the 2006 version of the International Social
Survey Programme (ISSP).2 Working with multiple sur-
veys ensures that our findings do not result from idiosyn-
crasies inherent in any single survey. In each of these
surveys, we use the level of perceived corruption as the
outcome variable and income and education, as measures
of socioeconomic status, as the predictors.
For the outcome variables, we use the original scales for
the 4-point corruption perception variables in CSES and
WVS and take an average of the two 5-point corruption
perception variables in ISSP, one about politicians and the
other about public officials. For the predictors, we use the
Maeda and Ziegfeld 3
original scales for income and education in CSES and
WVS. In CSES, the income variable is based on a 5-point
scale, whereas the education variable is based on an 8-point
scale. In WVS, the income variable is based on a 10-point
scale, whereas the education variable is based on an 8-point
scale. In ISSP, we use the 6-point education variable, but
transform the income variable by recoding the national cur-
rency units into US dollars and taking the log. The major
challenge in using multiple surveys is comparability, since
the surveys vary in how they measure corruption percep-
tions, income, and education. In analysis available in the
online appendix, we show that the results below do not sub-
stantively change when we standardize both the predictors
and the outcome variables.
Analysis
No-pooling regression
Given that richer countries tend to have lower average lev-
els of perceived corruption than poorer countries (Treisman,
2000),3 we cannot pool data from multiple countries and
regress each respondent's level of perceived corruption on
her income and education. We may wrongly infer that edu-
cated citizens are more likely to perceive lower levels of
corruption, even if no such relationship exists within most
countries, because education levels are likely to be higher
and the mean level of perceived corruption lower in rich
countries. Moreover, since previous studies have found dif-
fering relationships between income, education, and cor-
ruption perceptions in different national contexts, we
cannot simply assume that the size and magnitude of the
relationship between socioeconomic status and corruption
perceptions are identical across countries.
We therefore allow each country to have its own regres-
sion coefficient, running separate regressions for each
country without pooling the data. In other words, we treat
the data for each country j as a separate dataset, and fit the
following regression model.
y x
ij j j ij ij
= + +
  
0 1
In this equation, yij
is the level of corruption perception
for an individual i in country j, and xij
is either her house-
hold income or level of education. Each country j has its own
intercept 
0 j
and slope parameter 
1 j
. In order to estimate
these parameters, we fit dozens of regressions--one for each
of the two predictors in each of our country-level datasets.
We note two points about our estimation strategy. First, we
enter the individual-level predictors separately for each
regression and mainly focus on the bivariate relationships.
We take this minimalist approach because adding individual-
level control variables may induce post-treatment bias if they
are affected by the predictor of interest (King and Zeng,
2006). Second, we choose not to fit categorical choice
models. Although the categorical nature of the outcomes
suggests that we fit ordered logit or probit models, these
models are most useful for predicting probabilities that are
close to either zero or one. In contrast, interpreting how a
unit difference in the predictor is associated with the out-
come of interest is far more straightforward using linear
models (Angrist and Pischke, 2009: 107). Use of discrete
choice models does not substantively alter our results.
To illustrate our approach, we take the CSES dataset and
regress corruption perceptions on household income in
each country. Figure 1 presents the results. The black cir-
cles show the estimated coefficients, and the bars show the
95% confidence intervals. In countries with estimates on
the left half of the figure, poorer citizens perceive higher
levels of corruption, whereas in the countries on the right
half of the figure, richer citizens perceive corruption to be
more widespread. The gray circles in the figure represent
estimates controlling for education, gender, and age. In a
preliminary analysis we also added urban residence and
unemployment but the estimates did not noticeably change.
Since these variables were not available for many coun-
tries, we do not include them in the analysis presented here.
In analysis presented in the online appendix, we also show
that controlling for the ethnicity of the respondent does not
alter the results.
The figure reveals considerable variation across coun-
tries. In the most extreme case, the coefficient for the
United States is -0.11. This indicates that the level of cor-
ruption perceptions for citizens in the richest quintile is
likely to be 0.4 points lower on a 4-point scale than for citi-
zens in the poorest quintile. This difference represents
about half of a standard deviation in the corruption percep-
tion variable (0.78). Concretely, more than three-quarters
of American respondents from the poorest quintile consid-
ered corruption to be either "Quite widespread" or "Very
widespread," while a majority of respondents from the
richest quintile perceived corruption to be "Not very wide-
spread" or that "It doesn't happen at all".4 This rather strik-
ing disparity in how the two income groups perceive
corruption in the United States indicates that our findings
uncover substantively important variation. A somewhat
surprising result is that the addition of control variables for
education, gender, and age--none of which should intro-
duce post-treatment bias--does not drastically change the
results. Despite the correlation between the predictor and
the control variables, the estimates are roughly the same
except for Finland and Portugal.
When we repeat a similar analysis for WVS and ISSP,
the results are remarkably similar to those in Figure 1.
Using education instead of income as a predictor also
shows a similar pattern. On the whole, we find that in most
countries, the disadvantaged--those who are poorer and
less well educated--perceive higher levels of corruption
than fellow citizens who are wealthier and better educated.
However, as evident in Figure 1, there is considerable
(1)
4 Research and Politics 
variation across countries, with some coefficients in the
data close to zero or even somewhat positive.
Exploring cross-national variation
Having analyzed respondents from each country separately,
we find partial support for our hypothesis that the socioeco-
nomically disadvantaged perceive higher levels of corrup-
tion. However, like the existing literature, the findings are
somewhat mixed, revealing a number of countries where
this relationship does not hold. To gain a better handle on
where we do and do not find support for our hypothesis, we
investigate whether the regression coefficients in our previ-
ous analysis vary systematically across countries.
Although existing studies provide relatively little guid-
ance as to why the relationship between socioeconomic sta-
tus and corruption perceptions should vary cross-nationally,
one exception is Uslaner's (2008) claim about the tight con-
nection between corruption and inequality. Based on his
argument, we should expect that the negative association
between socioeconomic status and corruption perceptions
is particularly strong in highly unequal societies. However,
as we show in the online appendix, we do not find evidence
that fits this prediction. The association between socioeco-
nomic status and corruption perceptions does not vary
based on income inequality.
Economic development is another variable that may
explain variation in the relationship between socioeconomic

status and corruption perceptions. Countries at varying levels
of economic development experience not only different lev-
els, but also different forms, of corruption (Johnston, 2005;
Treisman, 2000; Uslaner, 2008). Wealthier countries experi-
ence less overall corruption and relatively little petty corrup-
tion, while poorer countries experience more overall
corruption, including both grand and petty corruption. This
variation in the corruption environment might influence the
relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and cor-
ruption perceptions. Specifically, in wealthier countries where
grand corruption is the main form of corruption, corruption's
harm to the poor may be more obvious. After all, the benefi-
ciaries of grand corruption are invariably those of high socio-
economic status. By contrast, the widespread nature of petty
corruption in poor countries--in which both rich and poor are
often implicated--could make the wealthy as sensitive to cor-
ruption as the poor, reducing the statistical relationship
between socioeconomic status and corruption perceptions.
To examine this possibility, we compare the regression
coefficients obtained from regressing corruption percep-
tions on income and education across countries at different
levels of economic development. For the level of economic
development, we use the per capita gross domestic product
(GDP)--measured as the purchasing power parity (PPP)
converted value in US dollars--for each country in the year
the survey was conducted based on data from Penn World
Tables 7.0. The results are shown in Figure 2. Per capita
GDP is plotted on the x-axis, and the regression coefficients
on the y-axis. For each of the datasets, we show the results
using income as the predictor in the left panel and educa-
tion in the right panel. The black circles show the regres-
sion coefficient in each country, and the bars show the 95%
confidence intervals. To indicate the general pattern in the
data, we fit a LOWESS line on the estimated coefficients
predicted by the level of per capita GDP.
In Figure 2, a clear pattern emerges. In all of the sub-
graphs in this figure, most of the coefficients are negative
(indicating that the poor and uneducated perceive higher
levels of corruption), but these coefficients become much
closer to zero and some even become positive in poorer
countries. In all of the surveys, the LOWESS line shows a
negative slope that intersects the x-axis at low levels of per
capita GDP. Whereas in advanced countries, high-income,
highly educated citizens tend to perceive lower levels of
corruption compared with other citizens, in developing
countries, the relationship is much weaker. The pattern for
each survey is roughly the same if we include the other pre-
dictors as controls.5
Multilevel models
We repeat the previous analysis with multilevel models to
address the concern that differences in the coefficients
across levels of economic development may be small
enough to have been generated by chance (Gelman and
Hill, 2007; Steenbergen and Jones, 2002). We use the cor-
ruption perceptions variables and the socioeconomic status
variables in their original scales and fit a multilevel linear
model allowing the intercepts and the slope parameters to
vary by country. In the context of equation (1), the individ-
ual-level parameters 
0 j
and 
1 j
are now modeled given
the level of per capita GDP as the country-level predictor.
Leaving the details in the online appendix, we visually dis-
play the results here in Figure 3.
Figure 3 is comparable to Figure 2 except that the graphs
are based on multilevel models. The regression line shows
the predicted marginal effect of income or education on
corruption perceptions by a country's level of per capita
GDP, and the scatterplot shows the predicted regression
coefficient of income (left column) or education (right col-
umn) on corruption perception for each country when the
country-level errors are added to the predicted marginal
effects. The vertical bars show the 95% confidence inter-
vals. Comparing Figures 2 and 3, the two estimates show a
roughly similar pattern.
Discussion
We began with the intuition that those most harmed by cor-
ruption should perceive more of it. Using dozens of surveys
from countries around the world, we found that this intuition
is correct--but only in affluent countries. In poorer countries,
the relationship between income and corruption perceptions
is much murkier. These findings are remarkably similar
across different sources of data, and they are highly robust.
An alternative explanation for our findings is that lower-
income citizens actually observe more corruption. Given that
petty corruption involving the average citizen tends to be
lower in affluent countries (Uslaner, 2008)--where our
results are strongest--it seems unlikely that the poor consist-
ently observe more corruption than the rich. However, the
data analysis cannot ultimately distinguish between these two
explanations, and we cannot therefore rule out the possibility
that lower-income citizens' perceptions of greater corruption
simply reflect their greater exposure to it.
Nevertheless, our consistent empirical findings have
two important implications. First, studies that employ cor-
ruption perceptions as a proxy for actual corruption should
bear in mind that perceptions of corruption will vary based
on who is being asked. Importantly, relying on expert opin-
ions implies different biases in different countries, since the
affluent and educated will systematically perceive less cor-
ruption than the poor and poorly educated mainly in wealthy
countries and less so elsewhere. Second, this article con-
tributes to a growing literature about heterogeneity in indi-
viduals' perceptions of the world around them. Whereas
previous work has focused largely on the impact of atti-
tudes and beliefs on corruption perceptions, we draw atten-
tion to socioeconomic status as a key shaper of an
individual's perceptions.

8 Research and Politics 
Finally, this article raises interesting questions for
future research. Most notably, why do the disadvantaged
in poorer countries not perceive more corruption than
their comparatively advantaged compatriots? We specu-
lated that developing and middle-income countries differ
from high-income countries in their corruption environ-
ment because of high overall levels of corruption and the
prevailing forms of corruption. However, an alternative
possibility is that corruption is mobilized as a political
issue differently across countries. Perhaps in poorer coun-
tries, low-income citizens tend to be concerned with other
issues, such that corruption is a largely middle-class pre-
occupation. This question of why precisely the relation-
ship between socioeconomic status and corruption
perceptions varies across levels of economic development
is therefore ripe for future research.

Notes
1. As an exception, Tverdova (2011) examines multiple coun-
tries and is attentive to the association between socioeco-
nomic status and corruption perceptions. We differ from
her study in relying on additional datasets to corroborate
our findings and approaching the data analysis differently.
Whereas she estimates her results by including a long line
of predictors into a single equation, introducing potentially
endogenous attitudinal variables, we separately examine the
relationships between income and corruption perceptions
and education and corruption perceptions.
2. The online appendix, available at www.adamziegfeld.com,
lists the countries covered by each set of surveys and the sur-
vey items we use in our analysis.
3. The online appendix documents this relationship in our data.
4. Among the 176 poorest respondents, 28.4% of respondents
chose the category indicating the highest level of corrup-
tion, and 47.2% of the respondents chose the second highest
category. Among the 173 richest respondents, the respective
figures were 9.8% and 35.2%.
5. Corresponding figures with control variables--including
education, gender, age, ethnicity and trust--are available in
the online appendix. The online appendix also documents
similar patterns when our dependent variable is a dichoto-
mous variable measuring whether the respondent perceives
higher levels of corruption compared with the national aver-
age in her country. This strategy addresses the concern that in
countries with high levels of corruption, there may be limited
variation in our dependent variable, which might affect our
findings.
