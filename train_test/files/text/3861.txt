Introduction
A considerable amount of literature exists on the impact of
tourism taxation on business performance (e.g., Alexander,
Bell, & Knowles, 2005; Bird, 1992; Braunerhjelm, Eklund, &
Thulin, 2015), on the economy (Gooroochurn & Sinclair,
2005), and on the welfare of the general public (Fjeldstad &
Semboja, 2001; McKerchar & Evans, 2009). However, the
shortage of literature regarding the tax administration burden
or the uncertainty and complexity of the tax laws, particularly
in the tourism sector in least developed countries, is still pro-
nounced. Tourism taxation has become an increasingly impor-
tant area in public finance for tourism investors, host
governments, and researchers today (Dubin, Graetz, & Wilde,
1987; Council, 1998). Its importance is manifest in public­
private dialogues, and the lobbying and advocacy of both
practitioners and academic literature (Anderson et al., 2017;
Bettcher, Herzberg, & Nadgrodkiewicz, 2015; World Bank
Group, 2014). The contribution of tourism is well recognized
as a sector having a comparative advantage in spreading eco-
nomic benefits and providing alternative economic opportuni-
ties, through investment, revenue for the government in the
form of taxes and levies, employment generation, foreign
exchange earnings, and sustainable development (Anderson &
Juma, 2011; Council, 1998; World Trade Organisation, 1998;
World Tourism Organization, 2010).
Specifically, tourism is a significant source of income for
the Zanzibar economy, and the largest source of foreign
exchange. Tourism contributes 27% of the isles' government
revenue and 80% of its foreign exchange earnings (Anderson,
2013; Steck, Wood, & Bishop, 2010). Tourism has many
components, including travel experience, accommodation,
food and beverages, shopping, entertainment, aesthetics, and
special events. The providers include travel agents, tour oper-
ators, transporters/carriers, attraction developers, tourist
information and guiding centers, accommodation, and cater-
ing services (Pasape, Anderson, & Lindi, 2013). The Council

Tax Administrative Burdens in the
Tourism Sector in Zanzibar: Stakeholders'
Perspectives
Deogratius Mahangila1 and Wineaster Anderson1
Abstract
The shortage of literature regarding the tax administration burden, particularly in the hospitality and tourism sector in the
context of least developed countries, still exists. This study, therefore, investigates the tax administration burden in the
tourism sector in the Zanzibar Islands. It specifically examines the structure of tourism taxes and the fiscal regime, measures
the uncertainty and complexity of tax laws, and assesses the role played by business associations in facilitating collective action
to reform the business environment of the tourism sector in this Archipelago. The study involved a survey of stakeholders
(N = 135), including tourism investors, business associations, and relevant government agencies. The findings showed that
uncertainty concerning the value added tax laws centered on calculation of the input tax, the input tax refund from mainland
Tanzania, and the registration procedure. The confusion was also pronounced regarding the specific laws affecting tour
operators, restaurants, and the hotel levy. Similarly, there is still uncertainty concerning the infrastructure tax and the
imposition of a tax of US$1 per day per guest staying in a hotel. Moreover, uncertainty and complexity regarding the income
tax laws is centered on calculating the income tax liability of businesses, investments, and employment. However, the role of
business associations in reforming the business environment for tourism has been encouraging, as a good number of public­
private dialogues and initiatives have been geared at negotiating the various forms of taxes and levies imposed on tourism
and hospitality services in the Archipelago. The study concludes with managerial, policy, and research recommendations.

(1998) defined tourism taxes as taxes that are ". . . applicable
specifically to tourists and the tourism sector or, alternatively,
if not specific to the tourism sector, those which are applied
differently in tourist destinations" (p. 16). Many governments
tax tourism activities to generate revenue and to repair tour-
ism-related damage (Bird, 1992). Meanwhile, tourism inves-
tors see tourism taxes as negatively affecting their businesses,
as taxes increase prices. Consequently, these parties focus on
the tourism taxation system, the amount of taxes, and their
impact on business and government revenue.
Globally, tourism taxation has received a lot of attention.
For example, Fish (1982), Gooroochurn and Sinclair (2003),
and Hazari and Ng (1993) investigated the objectives of tour-
ism taxation, while Gooroochurn and Sinclair (2005), Jensen
and Wanhill (2002), Balke (2000), and Kweka (2004) stud-
ied the impact of tourism taxation on tourists, the economy,
and the welfare of the general public. However, there has
been no work on the burden of tourism tax administration or
the uncertainty and complexity of the tax laws. This lack of
focus limits academic discussion on how to tax the tourism
sector efficiently and effectively, leading to a meaningful
policy being formulated. Consequently, this study sought to
make a contribution by researching the structure of tourism
taxes and the fiscal regime, measuring the uncertainty and
complexity of the tax laws, and assessing the role of business
associations in facilitating collective action to reform the
business environment of the tourism sector.
Moreover, the tourism and hospitality sector is dominated
by the private sector, which eventually shares the benefits of
the industry with the public sector in the form of taxes, con-
tributions, fees, and levies (Anderson et al., 2017). This is the
main idea behind this study, which is to find out stakehold-
ers' perspectives on the tax administration burden when run-
ning a tourism business, and to propose an appropriate
framework that would improve the business climate, leading
to private sector development and eventually to poverty
reduction among local communities.
We expect the article to contribute to the literature on tour-
ism taxation, public­private dialogues and partnerships. The
article utilizes the measurement of the complexity of tax laws
devised by Jones, Rice, Sherwood, and Whiting (2015) to
estimate the complexity of tourism taxation, with a view to
identifying areas where simplification is greatly needed, and
to explore the uncertainty of the tax laws. Moreover, this
study adds to the few articles examining tax administration
costs in Tanzania (Mahangila, 2017; Shekidele, 1999) and
public­private dialogues and partnerships (Anderson et al.,
2017). This is because, many studies from developed coun-
tries (e.g., Alexander et al., 2005; Pope, 1995; Sandford &
Hasseldine, 1992; Schoonjans, Van Cauwenberge, Reekmans,
& Simoens, 2011) have mainly focused on estimating tax
compliance costs. We expect the findings also to provide les-
sons on how to promote the right conditions for private sector
development, to inform good practice, and policy formation
and to improve the business environment in Zanzibar.
To this end, the "Literature Review" section offers a
review of the literature. The "Research Method" section
presents the study's research methodology. The "Findings"
section presents the data analysis and findings. The
"Conclusion" section discusses the findings and draws con-
clusions from the study.
Literature Review
Conceptualizing Tax Compliance in the Tourism
Sector
Tax compliance is important for the provision of public ser-
vices because without adequate tax revenue the quality of
public services may deteriorate. Tax compliance means tax-
payers fulfilling their obligations (Kirchler, 2007). However,
gathering enough tax revenue is a problem faced by many
countries because of tax evasion and avoidance. Tax evasion
is a deliberate illegal act intended to reduce someone's tax
liability, while actions taken to legally reduce one's tax lia-
bility is tax avoidance (Alm, 1999; Slemrod, 2007). Tax
compliance may be more important today than in previous
years because many countries are tackling budget deficits.
Moreover, tax compliance is important for achieving fairness
and enhancing resource allocation (Alm, 1999).
Previous studies have shown that tax compliance is a func-
tion of both economic and noneconomic factors. Economic
factors include tax rates, income level, penalties, and tax audit
rate (Allingham & Sandmo, 1972). It has been observed that
high tax rates, lower penalty rates, and a lower perceived
audit rate decrease the tax compliance level (Dubin et al.,
1987; Dubin, Graetz, & Wilde, 1990). On the contrary, the tax
compliance level increases with a reduction in tax rates,
higher penalty rates, and higher perceived audit rates
(Andreoni, Erard, & Feinstein, 1998). Noneconomic factors
include the age of taxpayers, the educational level of taxpay-
ers, confidence in the tax laws, social norms, and perceptions
of the justice of the tax system. It has been found that older
taxpayers, educated taxpayers, and taxpayers with greater
confidence in the tax laws are more likely to pay their taxes
than young taxpayers, poorly educated taxpayers, and taxpay-
ers with less confidence in the tax laws (Cadsby, Maynes, &
Trivedi, 2006; Fjeldstad & Semboja, 2001; Saad, 2010).Also,
taxpayers residing in a tax-compliant society are reported to
be more compliant than those coming from a noncompliant
one (O. H. Chang, Nichols, & Schultz, 1987). More impor-
tantly, the tax compliance level is reported to be positively
related to procedural justice (Mahangila & Holland, 2015). It
has also been reported that compliance costs and compliance
levels are negatively related (Mahangila, 2017). Tax compli-
ance costs are those relating to taxpayers fulfilling their
responsibilities (Evans, 2003). These tax compliance costs
comprise the time spent complying with tax laws, printing
costs, the cost of administering tax laws, and corruption that
mainly takes place in administrative procedures.
Mahangila and Anderson 3
Tourism taxation embodies those taxes imposed on tour-
ists and/or the tourist industry (Council, 1998). There are
many reasons why governments focus on taxing the tourism
sector, but, for the purpose of this research, we focused on
the major ones. First, in tourism-based countries or regions,
the sector is the major economic activity, leaving the country
or region with fewer options when determining what activi-
ties to tax (Dombrovski & Hodzi, 2010; Gooroochurn &
Sinclair, 2003), and so most of the tax revenue may come
from that sector.
Second, due to the specific nature of tourism, economists
believe that taxing tourism activities will only have a small
impact on taxpayers'behavior (i.e., consuming less, or more,
of the activity) if most of the taxes are borne by foreign tour-
ists (Gooroochurn & Sinclair, 2003). Consequently, govern-
ments favor imposing more taxes and levies on activities
mostly undertaken by foreign tourists (Sheldon & Var, 1985),
as a heavy local taxation burden may cause public discontent
and negatively affect the political environment (Anderson,
2009). In some cases, an increase in the tax rate may cause
some minor economic distortions, when, for example, a tour-
ist destination is unique in its nature, as this leaves tourists
without alternative choices, and lowers the elasticity of sub-
stitution. The elasticity of substitution is a measure of the
ease with which varying factors can be substituted for others
(Hicks, 1932). In this case, it refers to how easily tourists can
substitute one tourist destination (let us say Zanzibar) for
competing destinations (e.g., Mombasa, Mauritius, etc.).
Third, for destination managers, imposing taxes on tour-
ism activities serves as a means to recover the costs of the
public services and goods consumed by tourists (Varela,
2011). For example, tourists consume infrastructure, such as
roads, health services, and security while in a destination
country. Thus, taxes simply recover the costs of servicing
tourists. Environmental conservationists use taxation as one
of the measures to regulate a destination's carrying capacity.
A growth in the number of tourists, and the associated facili-
ties, is associated with increased pollution, congestion, deple-
tion of natural resources, and a reduction in aesthetic value
(Böhringer, Ferris, & Rutherford, 1998; Green, Hunter, &
Moore, 1990). Consequently, funds are collected from tour-
ism activities to restore the damage caused by the industry.
Fourth, tourism taxation can be used to encourage the
smooth flow of tourists through the variability of tax rates
(Varela, 2011). For example, in high season, an increase in
tax rates for tourism may discourage some tourists from vis-
iting a given destination in that period, whereas a decrease in
tax rates in low season may attract some tourists to visit such
a destination at that time, as the tourism package is cheaper.
Tax Compliance and Complexity of Tax Laws
Complex tax laws are those with which it is difficult and
expensive to comply (Mulder, Verboon, & De Cremer, 2009).
However, tax compliance occurs when a taxpayer
registers with the revenue authority as required; files the required
returns on time; accurately reports tax liability (in the required
returns) in accordance with the prevailing legislation, rulings,
return instructions and court decisions; pays any outstanding
taxes as they fall due; and maintains all records as required.
(McKerchar & Evans, 2009, pp. 172-173)
Generally, the literature on how the complexity of tax laws
affects tax compliance behavior remains controversial.
Scotchmer (1989) claimed that tax revenue authorities prefer
complex tax laws to simple ones, because uncertainty is
more likely to induce tax compliance. Scotchmer (1989)
argued that, even when taxpayers seek professional help to
resolve complex tax problems, not all uncertainties are
resolved. As taxpayers are penalized for noncompliance,
they, together with their tax return advisors, might react to
theremaininguncertaintiesbypayingmoreintax(Scotchmer,
1989). Similarly, White, Curatola, and Samson (1990) sug-
gested that complex tax laws may help tax authorities to win
tax disputes and increase tax revenue. On the contrary, the
conclusion that taxpayers might increase their compliance
level, because the uncertainties and complexities of the tax
laws boost the likelihood of tax authorities winning cases,
has no empirical evidence to back it up.
Nevertheless, when tax fairness causes complexity in tax
laws, the complexity might increase tax compliance, because
tax fairness is an important factor in tax compliance decision
making (Milliron, 1985). Indeed, Milliron (1985) found an
increase in the inclination to pay taxes when distributive fair-
ness increased tax complexity. Distributive justice refers to
the fair allocation of the tax burden, and to governments pro-
viding goods and services for taxpayers (Wenzel, 2002).
Cuccia and Carnes (2001) supported the view that tax
fairness can increase tax compliance levels, even when the
tax laws are complex. Cuccia and Carnes (2001) conducted a
hypothetical experiment to determine how participants' per-
ceptions of procedural justice change when the complexity
of tax laws was justified or not. They found that, when com-
plex tax laws were justified, and when participants were pro-
vided with tax relief, their perceptions of procedural justice
were more favorable than when the complexity of the tax
laws lacked justification and they had less tax relief (Cuccia
& Carnes, 2001). Concern about the fairness of the distribu-
tion of the tax burden and providing the public with goods
and services is known as procedural justice (Leventhal,
1980; Thibaut & Walker, 1978). However, as that study was
confined to the effect of the complexity of tax laws on tax-
payers' perceptions of procedural justice, tax compliance
decisions were excluded from it. Also, J. B. Chang, Lusk,
and Norwood (2009) showed that hypothetical intentions
may differ from actual behavior.
Nevertheless, opposing evidence has suggested that
complex tax laws produce negative attitudes toward tax
compliance (Kirchler, Niemirowski, & Wearing, 2006;
Milliron, 1985). For instance, participants' attitudes toward
4 SAGE Open
tax compliance were most unfavorable when the complex-
ity of tax laws offered more tax noncompliance opportuni-
ties and when taxes were perceived to be unfair (Milliron,
1985). Likewise, a hypothetical experiment revealed that
tax avoidance decreases with precise tax laws (Richardson,
2006; Spilker, Worsham, & Prawitt, 1999).
Furthermore, the difficulty inherent in separating errors
from deliberate tax evasion (Slemrod, 2007) could lead to
the punishment of innocent taxpayers, resulting in less confi-
dence in the tax laws, which lowers taxpayers' disposition to
pay taxes (Frey & Torgler, 2007). In this regard, Mills (1996)
suggested that complex tax laws increase tax compliance
costs, create room for evasion and, when tax compliance
costs are far greater than the tax evasion opportunities, tax
compliance may suffer.
Tax Compliance Costs and Tax Administration
Burden
Tax compliance costs are probably the major by-product of
the complexity of tax laws. Tax compliance costs have been
found to be significant and regressive (Alexander et al.,
2005; Pope, 1995; Sandford & Hasseldine, 1992; Schoonjans
et al., 2011). Alexander et al. (2005) kept a record of the time
and money spent complying with tax laws by small firms in
New Zealand for 2 months and found a similar pattern.
Nevertheless, there has been concern that taxes in
Zanzibar in general, and the tourism sector in particular,
may not conform to the efficiency criterion of a good tax
system (Zanzibar National Chamber of Commerce,
Industry, and Agriculture [ZNCCIA], 2013). Although
there is a general consensus that taxation is a necessary part
of building a healthy economy, taxes must be reasonable,
transparent, and fair. In Zanzibar, this has not been the case
because there is a general feeling in the tourist industry that
taxation has become a burden for taxpayers (The Citizen,
2015). This has been reflected in an economic downturn,
resulting in investors migrating from Zanzibar, taking with
them their potential for investment, transferable skills, and
the potential for creating employment. The World Bank
(2010) positioned Zanzibar at 155 out of 183 in the world
ranking of the business environment. Zanzibar's tax regime
is perceived to be complex and uncertain because of the tax
administration burden.
As a result of this tax administration burden, there is a
high level of discontent regarding Zanzibar's business
environment. For instance, it has been discovered that
medium-sized businesses in Zanzibar make 48 tax pay-
ments, their profits are taxed at 40%, and they spend nearly
160 hr annually complying with tax laws (World Bank,
2010). According to the World Bank (2010), small island
countries made an average of 28 tax payments, while Sub-
Saharan Africa made an average of 38 tax payments. In
contrast, businesses in similar tourism islands, such as the
Maldives, made a single tax payment, their commercial
profits were taxed at 9.1%, and they spent less than 1 hr per
year on tax compliance. Thus, the Zanzibar tax regime lags
far behind similar economies.
According to the ZNCCIA (2013), the complexity of
Zanzibar's tax regime reduces the competitiveness of the
business environment, including its vibrant tourist industry.
Tourism is a significant source of income for Zanzibar and
currently generates 15,000 direct and 50,000 indirect jobs
relating to the industry (Anderson, 2015; The Citizen (2015).
If the unfavorable climate persists, Zanzibar faces the possi-
bility of losing the benefits of the tourist industry. The indus-
try is well-known for its ability to create jobs for Zanzibaris
and Tanzanians in general, to develop the human resource
base, to provide capital across the industry, to protect and
conserve natural attractions, to preserve and celebrate
Zanzibar's unique culture, to contribute substantially to the
tax base, and to contribute to poverty alleviation, by working
with local communities. The fact that foreign investors are
migrating from Zanzibar due to, among other factors, the
quantity, cumbersomeness, and complexity of the taxation
system and its administrative procedures, means that the
economy of Zanzibar will continue to decline if the neces-
sary interventions continue to be ignored. Thus, this study
was aimed at investigating the tax administration burden on
the tourism sector in the Zanzibar Islands.
Research Methodology
This study used a qualitative-descriptive approach (Lambert
& Lambert, 2012) by collecting primary and secondary data
through in-depth interviews and reviewing the literature and
documents. This in-depth interview approach is important
for gaining an understanding of the research problem
(Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007). Secondary sources of data
were chosen to reveal the complexity and uncertainty of tax
laws, which previous research has not done. Specifically, the
secondary sources of data were the East Africa Customs and
Management Act of 2004; The Income Tax Act of 2004; The
Value Added Tax (VAT) Act Number 4 of 1998, local excise
duty, the petroleum levy, under the Petroleum Levy Act
Number 7 of 2001, Stamp Duty, supervised under Act
Number 6 of 1996, Infrastructure TaxAct, underAct Number
9 of 2015, and the Hotel, Restaurant and Tour Operation
Levy, which all fall under the Hotel Levy Act of 1995. In
addition, the Public Finance Acts from 2010 to 2015 were
included in this study.
The interviews took place between July and November
2015. The population consisted of tourism stakeholders,
namely, tax authorities, hoteliers, airline staff, tour operators,
restaurateurs, the Zanzibar International Film Festival
(ZIFF), and Sauti ya Busara, together with other service pro-
viders supporting tourism investors, such as auditors and tax
consultants in Zanzibar. Each business was either directly
related to the tourism sector or helping it to comply with
taxation laws in Zanzibar.
Mahangila and Anderson 5
Sixty-nine of the interviewees were tourism investors:
hoteliers (52%), tour operators (29%), sky-diving business
operators (2%), restaurateurs (13%), and festival organizers,
that is, ZIFF and Sauti ya Busara (4%). Also, 30 tax consul-
tants were interviewed about uncertainty, tax administration
procedures, and the complexity of the tax laws, because
many tourism investors depend on their tax consultants to
enable them to comply with the tax laws. In addition, 36
respondents came from the Zanzibar Investment Promotion
Agency (17%), the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism (8%),
the Tanzania Revenue Authority­Zanzibar (11%), the
Ministry of Tourism (8%), the Copyright Society of Zanzibar
(6%), the Ministry of Finance and Planning (14%), the
Zanzibar Revenue Board (ZRB; 17%), the Zanzibar Airport
Authority (3%), the Ministry of Land­Zanzibar (3%), the
Zanzibar Office of Statistics (8%), and the Ministry of Local
Government (3%).
Because the qualitative approach was taken by this
research, an open-ended questionnaire was used to solicit
detailed responses from the respondents. The guiding
questions ranged from "What areas or sections of the
Income Tax Act 2004 do you consider to be uncertain?"
and "Why do you consider them to be uncertain?" to "What
should be done to improve certainty in these areas?"
Similar questions were asked about other tax laws. A ques-
tion on the role of business associations in reforming the
business environment of the tourism sector in Zanzibar
was asked of business associations in the tourism and asso-
ciated sectors. The data provided were important for iden-
tifying the fees and taxes payable by the tourism sector in
Zanzibar. It should be noted that the results were limited to
a discussion of the responses from those involved in the
tourist industry and their consultants, and that responses
from government officials were used for triangulation pur-
poses and to validate the findings. Finally, descriptive and
reflective approaches were adopted to analyze and report
on the qualitative data (Eisenhardt, 1989). The findings are
presented below.
Findings
Structure of Tourism Taxes and Fiscal Regime in
Zanzibar
There are three tax authorities in Zanzibar, namely, the
Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA; Zanzibar), the ZRB, and
the local government authorities. The TRA administers
income tax under the Income TaxAct of 2004, which includes
both corporate and personal incomes, and customs and excise
duty, under the East Africa Customs and Management Act of
2004. On the contrary, the ZRB manages VAT, under the VAT
Act Number 4 of 1998, local excise duty, the petroleum levy,
under the Petroleum Levy Act Number 7 of 2001, stamp
duty, which is paid by all traders, at 3% of their sales, and
supervised under Act Number 6 of 1996, the infrastructure
tax, under Act Number 9 of 2015, and the hotel, restaurant,
and tour operator levy, which all fall under the Hotel Levy
Act of 1995 (see Figure 1).
In total, the Zanzibar taxation system charges 10 different
taxes, three of which are specifically for the tourist industry.
The general taxes are income tax, petroleum levy, customs
and excise tax, infrastructure tax, VAT, stamp duty, excise
duty (local), and property tax. In addition to the seven gen-
eral taxes, the tourist industry has to pay a hotel levy, a res-
taurant levy, and a tour operator levy in accordance with the
ZRB (see Figure 1).

Measuring the Uncertainty and Complexity of the
Tax Laws
Measuring tax complexity has been a difficult area for tax
researchers. A complexity index developed by Jones et al.
(2015) was used to assess the complexity of Zanzibar's tax
laws. The index is an investigative instrument used to iden-
tify necessary and unnecessary complexities. According to
Jones et al. (2015), necessary complexities are those needed
to achieve the objectives of the tax policy, and they can only
be changed if the objectives are changed, while an unneces-
sary complexity is that which can be changed without chang-
ing the tax policy objectives. This index divides tax laws into
several important tax areas, and considers small tax laws as
single, distinct tax areas. Ironically, stamp duty, the infra-
structure tax, petroleum levy, customs, and hotel levy tax
laws were taken as a single tax area. However, the income
tax law was divided into 20 separate tax sections, and the
VAT law was divided into six separate tax areas. These areas
are indicated in the rows in Table 1.
The index comprises measures of "underlying complex-
ity" and the "impact of complexity." The authors defined
underlying complexity as "a measure of the complexity of
the `maze'through which a taxpayer would be required to go
to comply with their tax responsibilities and to understand
their tax obligations (and the result of those obligations) with
no prior knowledge" (Jones et al., 2015, p. 5). The impact of
complexity measures the impact of underlying complexity in
terms of how many taxpayers are affected by a particular
indicator, the total tax compliance and administration costs,
the ability of taxpayers affected by an indicator, and the
potential loss of revenue due to a specific cause (Jones et al.,
2015). However, there was no information to enable mea-
surement of the impact of complexity and, therefore, only the
underlying complexity was measured in this study.
The underlying complexity measure comprises policy
complexity, legislative complexity, and operational com-
plexity. Policy complexity measures the complexity result-
ing from the governmental policy objectives of giving tax
exemptions and tax relief and changing tax laws.
Consequently, the policy complexity of a tax law is identified
by two indicators: the number of exemptions plus the num-
ber of those receiving tax relief in that law and the number of
finance acts with tax law changes. It is generally accepted
that a tax law that increases the number of exemptions or
those given tax relief increases its complexity, in terms of
deciding whether or not a taxpayer/income/transaction is
exempt from tax (Barazzoni, Cerri, & Hepburn, 2006). Also,
frequent changes in tax laws, through the passing of Finance
Acts or otherwise, increases the complexity of tax laws, as
taxpayers or tax consultants have to spend more time famil-
iarizing themselves with the changes (Barazzoni et al., 2006).
Legislative complexity measures how difficult it is to
understand a tax law. This indicator is measured using a read-
ability index, scoring 1 when it is simple to read, 3 when it is
of medium difficulty, and 5 when it is difficult. This score is
subject to participants' perception of the scores and, there-
fore, two tax consultants were involved in scoring this index.
Legislative complexity is also measured by the number of
pages in the legislation because it is assumed that people
associate longer texts with complexity (Jones et al., 2015).
Finally, operational complexity indicates how complex it
is to use the guidance provided by the tax authorities to facil-
itate compliance with the tax laws. The tax guidance docu-
ments include, but are not limited to, practice notices,
brochures containing tax information, and regulations about
how to apply tax laws. Complexity of the guidance given by
the TRA and ZRB was assigned 1, 3, or 5 if it was straight-
forward, of medium complexity, and complex, respectively.
The scoring was based on the length of the guidance, the ease
of navigation, other guidance information, and the frequency
of change. Furthermore, operational complexity relates to
the complexity of the information required to make a tax
return, which measures the degree of difficulty of gathering
information to meet tax compliance obligations. In this case,
the complexity of information was assigned 1, 3, or 5 if it
was straightforward (using available information), of
medium complexity (simple computation), and complex
(requiring difficult computation), respectively. Again, these
scorings are subjective, and so the scoring was done by the
two tax consultants mentioned previously.
After the scoring was completed, the scores of each indi-
cator was normalized to get a scale of values of between 0
and 1 using the standardization formula: Y1
= (Y ­ Ymin
) /
(Ymax
­ Ymin
) (Jones et al., 2015), where "Y" is the value of the
indicator of a tax measure, "Ymin
" represents an indicator's
lowest value across all tax measures, and Ymax
indicates the
highest. An aggregation formula ((Y1
+ Z1
+ . . . n1
) / 6) × 10
was then used to transform the index to give scores of
between 1 and 10, where n1 represents a normalized indica-
tor and 6 represents the indicators of underlying complexity,
which are indicated in the third row from number of exemp-
tions/relief to complexity of information required to make a
return. The multiplying factor 10 was included to produce a
final index of a definite number between two defined points,
1 and 10, whereby 1 meant the least complex and 10 the most
complex (see the study by Jones et al., 2015, for further
information). In this case, all six indicators had equal weight-
ings to increase clarity, remove the need to change weight-
ings when the tax system changes, enable comparability of
the complexity of the system over time as the scores are not
weighed (Jones et al., 2015), and reduce subjectivity in mea-
suring complexity.

complain about spending much more time complying with
the regulatory changes than concentrating on the business
itself. According to a report by the ZNCCIA (2013), com-
plexities of the Zanzibar tax regime reduce the competitive-
ness of the business environment, including its vibrant tourist
industry, and in fact they are of the opinion that there is unfair
treatment and many complexities when it comes to tax
administration in the sector (see Figure 2). More specifically,
the Zanzibar Income Tax Act, 2004, shows the underlying
complexity of tourism taxes in general. For instance, Section
7 of the Income Tax Act (2004) has nine types of tax relief or
exemptions, whereas other sections in the Income Tax Act
2004 have between zero and two exemptions. Section 7 has
listed employment income and exempt employment income,
repeating most of the employment income, but granting
exemptions when certain conditions are met. This repetition
of the same items makes it difficult to calculate employment
income. However, the second schedule of the Act contains a
list of 20 exempted incomes or taxpayers. This schedule was
created to streamline the exemptions to income tax into a
single list.
Section 56 of the Income Tax Act (2004) was amended 3
times between 2010 and 2015 by the passing of Finance
Acts. This section deals with changes in the ownership of an
entity and attempts to prevent tax avoidance practices by
imposing taxes on capital gains when ownership of the entity
changes by more than 50%. Thus, these changes in the sec-
tions may reflect the TRA's efforts to protect tax revenue.
In terms of the readability index, the definition of perma-
nent establishment covered in Part VI Division II, Section 3
of the Act defines key terms and individual income tax struc-
tures, and Section 66, dealing with residential status, both
scored 3 points, meaning they had medium readability com-
plexity. These sections and the first schedule treated the
various tax issues they presented differently, and section 7 in
particular lacked clarification and used long sentences to
explain the taxation of employment income, which confused
readers. These findings implied that the legislative complex-
ity of these factors was medium. Also, the number of pages
of the Income Tax Act (2004) remained constant, at 126
pages, during this period.
Section 56 and the taxation of foreign-controlled entities
were perceived to have greater guidance complexity and
required complex information to file returns. These percep-
tions may be attributed to the lack of clear guidance by the
TRA and because the information that is supposed to be
filed, or recomputed, is different from the common informa-
tion that taxpayers are given. The remaining sections of the
Income Tax Act were perceived to be either simple or of
medium operational complexity.
The complexity of theThe East Africa Customs and Management
Act, 2004.This was generally perceived to be simple,
although it was the longest Act, with 168 pages. The read-
ability index was of medium complexity as there was little
taxpayer guidance information and so the operational com-
plexity was medium.
The complexity of the VAT Act, 1998. Most of the changes in
the VAT Act were made in the first schedule (11) and the
second schedule (23), while only one change in each was
made in Sections 6 and 7. These findings imply that the pol-
icy was not complex, due to few changes in the Act and
because many of the exemptions/relief were listed in the first
and second schedules of the Act. In terms of the readability
index, the Act was rated as simple due to its short and
straightforward explanations, while the number of pages
remained constant at 38 for the study period. This signifies
Figure 2. Simplifying the process of paying taxes will improve the ease of doing business, encourage compliance, stimulate economic
growth, and boost employment.

that the Act was not complex. The operational complexity of
the VAT Act of 1998 was generally at a low level because
most of the sections were simple and had straightforward
explanations, while the numbers of its pages remained the
same during the reporting period. Regarding operational
complexity, all sections were rated simple due to their clear
and straightforward explanations. Thus, the VAT Act was
found to be simple and clear.
The complexity of the Hotel Levy Act, 1995. The Act had only
one exemption/relief, and only two Finance Acts changed
this Act between 2010 and 2015. Its readability was rated
simple and theAct had only nine pages, which remained con-
stant during the reporting period. These findings imply that
the policy was not complex nor was the legislative index of
the hotel levy, which had clear and straightforward explana-
tions. Similarly, the guidance provided and the information
needed for filing a return were both perceived to be simple
and straightforward.
The complexity of the Infrastructure Tax law.This was a new
law, which had only one page and no changes. It was clear
and straightforward in terms of readability, guidance, and the
information required to fill in returns.
The complexity of the Stamp Duty Act, 1995. The Act had 23
exemptions/relief and had changed twice between 2010 and
2015. These findings imply that policy complexity was
medium, as well as the legislative index, as indicated by a
readability index score of 3 and the number of pages of the
Act at 57. The readability index was rated medium because
some sections used difficult vocabulary or terms.
Finally, it was perceived that both the guidance provided
and the information needed to make a return were of medium
complexity as the guidance was not straightforward and
additional information, other than that commonly available,
was required when filing returns.
Uncertainty of the Tax Laws in Zanzibar
The Income Tax Act 2004. The areas perceived to be uncer-
tain were the calculation of income tax liability from busi-
ness, investment, and employment incomes. Calculation of
the depreciation allowance, unallocated income, and the resi-
dential status of taxpayers were also mentioned as areas of
uncertainty, probably because the legislation had been badly
drafted. Moreover, it was difficult to differentiate sources of
business income from investment income. For example,
tourism investor respondents commented that
It is unclear if rental income from the lease of a hotel should be
categorized as business or investment income.
The way a foreign-controlled corporation is treated in terms of
distributing its unallocated income to its members is ambiguous.
Sources of employment income are listed followed by another
list of exempt employment income repeating almost the same
sources of employment income.
Accordingly, uncertainty of the income tax laws was mainly
caused by limited practice and training, incomplete defini-
tions of the key terms, and inadequate drafting of the tax law.
These findings are in line with the findings of the complexity
index previously presented.
The East African Customs and Management Act 2004.Many
respondents were unaware of the customs tax laws. How-
ever, a few were of the opinion that customs tax liability
on imported goods was uncertain as this was usually
determined by tax officials. One tourism investor respon-
dent stated,
Customs tax liability is usually charged according to a tax
official's decision and not based on the actual goods imported
into the country.
The introduction of customs tax calculators, where taxpayers
can enter details of imported goods and know their tax liabil-
ity, could resolve this uncertainty. However, it is possible
that tax officials might be exploiting taxpayers' ignorance to
collect more taxes.
The VAT Act 1999. The ZRB failed to properly communicate
a change in the treatment of the input tax paid in mainland
Tanzania, where taxpayers continued to deduct it. However,
the new treatment does not allow the input taxes paid on the
mainland to be deducted by taxpayers in Zanzibar, as noted
by two of the tourism investors:
ZRB tends to refuse the input tax from Mainland Tanzania and
there is no clear regulation on it.
Where a taxable person pays tax to a taxable person in mainland
Tanzania for any taxable supply, the taxable person in Zanzibar
is unable to claim the input tax. It is a problem.
Clearly, this finding implies that taxpayers were unaware of
this change. When following this up with ZRB, it was dis-
covered that input tax paid in mainland Tanzania was no lon-
ger deductible in Zanzibar, following the abolition of the
reciprocal arrangement with mainland Tanzania. This
arrangement allowed the TRA in mainland Tanzania to col-
lect output taxes from persons on the mainland who pur-
chased goods and services for the purpose of importing them
into Zanzibar. Then, after collection, the TRA in mainland
Tanzania paid the amount to the Zanzibar Revolutionary
Government.
It seems that the limited time between the introduction of
tax law changes and implementation of the changes may
have caused this inconsistency between taxpayers and the tax
authorities.
10 SAGE Open
Likewise, VAT registration criteria and procedures were
uncertain as they were used to calculate penalties for various
breaches of the Act, as well as interest. Moreover, undue
delays in refunding VAT was cited as one of the uncertainties
of this Act. These delays may cause businesses financial
stress as their working capital is stranded at the ZRB. One
respondent from the tourism investors stated,
There are no known registration procedures as it all depends on
the decision of the commissioner.
The Hotel Levy Act 1995. This Act covers three taxes: Hotel
Levy, Tour Operator Levy, and Restaurant Levy. This con-
solidation of three taxes was perceived to be a source of
uncertainty when determining what, and how much, tax to
pay. As one tourism investor stated,
There is no specific law for the tour operator levy or restaurant
levy which has been included in the Hotel Levy Act.
It is arguable that it would be better to have three separate
laws for these three taxes. However, consolidation of the tax
laws was advised so as to reduce the administrative burden
(Barazzoni et al., 2006). Therefore, the Hotel Levy Act
should comprise separate sections for hoteliers, restaura-
teurs, and tour operators to remove this confusion.
Also, some tour operator respondents complained about
being forced to pay the US$5,000 tour operator levy during
the low season, when income from tourism is low. This not
only denied investors badly needed working capital, but also
increased compliance costs.
The Infrastructure Tax Law 2015. This Law lacked definition
of key terms, although it was the simplest law, but the lack of
definitions limited its implementation. For instance, the law
imposed an infrastructure tax of US$1 per day per guest stay-
ing in a hotel. A hotel investor respondent said,
The law does not define all legal terms, including "guest" in this
law, the guest can be either an adult or a child, but the law is
silent on this.
There were also concerns about why the tax was being paid
in U.S. dollars when the taxpayers did not receive an income
in dollars (a reply from a hotel investor respondent), particu-
larly when guests were residents of Zanzibar or mainland
Tanzania.
Tax Administration Burden
The Zanzibar tax system operates through self-assessment,
whereby taxpayers determine their tax liability and pay their
taxes to the tax authorities: the TRA-Zanzibar, the ZRB, the
local government authorities, and other regulatory authori-
ties. However, the tax system still requires taxpayers to visit
several offices and file several documents to fulfill their
obligations (see Figure 3). In addition, taxpayers make more
than 48 compulsory payments included in these estimations
per year, as shown in Table 2.
In this study, we asked tourism investors to estimate the
time spent complying with the tax regime. This time was
then used to estimate compliance costs, based on the unit
costs found in Doing Business in Zanzibar (World Bank,
2010) and Zaki and Alex (2010) in the Tanzanian tourism
sector. These were the costs of printing/photocopying, trans-
port, time spent processing information, those associated
with disputes, such as reprinting costs, labor time, and con-
sultancy costs. The average cost of complying with the
selected taxes in Zanzibar is more than TZS 1,428,000
(US$640.36) per annum. However, Zanzibar has an esti-
mated 5,000 registered taxpayers and, when this cost is
extrapolated, the impact of tax administration costs was TZS
7,140,000,000 (see the appendix). This finding is similar to
the findings of P. E. Lignier, Evans, and Tran-Nam (2014),
who discovered that tax compliance costs were growing,
despite the government's efforts to reduce them.
The Role of Business Associations in Reforming
the Business Environment of the Tourism Sector
in Zanzibar
There are several associations that support the development
of the tourism sector in the Archipelago. The main ones are
the ZATI (ZATI), the Zanzibar Association of Tour Guides
(ZATOGA), the Zanzibar Employees' Association
(ZANEMA), the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation
(TPSF), the ZNCCIA, the Ecotourism Association, and the
Hotel Restaurants' and Alliance Union. However, ZATI is
the largest association, which was established in 2003 to
represent the interests of all tourism investors in Zanzibar
and acts as the voice of the tourism private sector. With
around 106 members from various industries in the tourism
sector, such as hotels (60), tour operators (10), suppliers
(eight), water space (eight), restaurants (five), shops (three),
a consultant (one) and health official (one; also see Pasape
et al., 2013), ZATI unites and represents all members in the
tourism sector of Zanzibar and defends the rights and inter-
ests of stakeholders in it.
Moreover, the Association acts as a link between mem-
bers of the tourism sector and the government on matters of
socioeconomic policies; advises and cooperates closely with
the government in formulating policies and programs relat-
ing to the tourist industry and its promotion internally and
externally; supports, stimulates and catalyzes socioeconomic
development; and conducts research on socioeconomic
development and the tourist industry and shares its findings
with stakeholders. By so doing, ZATI has been successful
recently in pushing for changes to the VAT Amendment and
reviewing the tax regime, with the aim of improving the ease
of doing business in Zanzibar. The Association has also been
successful in initiating and implementing a public­private
Mahangila and Anderson 11
partnership (PPP) to create a better tourism environment for
both investors and tourists. Moreover, ZATI represents the
private sector in meetings with government authorities in
Zanzibar to discuss business challenges. ZATI frequently
commissions studies (including the most recent ones by
Mahangila & Anderson, 2016) to compile evidence to feed
into dialogue with the government. The most recent studies,
for example, have enabled ZATI to convince the government
to speed up the creation of an electronic tax system to allow
businesses to pay taxes not only in U.S. dollars, but also in
the local currency (i.e., Tanzanian Shillings), to extend the
VAT filing date from 7 to 10 days, to consolidate existing
taxes and to stop introducing new taxes (also see Masare,
2016). Generally, the role of business associations in reform-
ing the business environment of the tourism sector in
Zanzibar has been felt by it.
Conclusion
Complexity and uncertainty in the tax system lead to a
greater administrative burden and thus to higher compliance
costs, based on earlier arguments, than to lower compliance
costs. However, this study has revealed tremendous uncer-
tainty regarding the income tax laws in Zanzibar centered on
the calculation of input taxes, input tax refunds from main-
land Tanzania, and the registration procedure. There is no
specific law for the tour operator levy, restaurant levy, and

hotel levy, which caused uncertainty regarding the Hotel
Levy Act. Similarly, uncertainty regarding the infrastructure
tax was due to the absence of a clear interpretation of certain
terms used in the law and to the imposition of the tax of
US$1 per day per guest staying in a hotel. Furthermore, there
was uncertainty about the change in the treatment of input
tax paid in mainland Tanzania, the calculation of penalties
and offenses, and the registration procedure. The results
show that many respondents identified that uncertainty con-
cerning the income tax laws centered on the calculation of
the income tax liability for businesses, investors, and employ-
ers. Although some laws were found to be simple, most were
found to be of medium complexity. This calls for minor mod-
ifications in the tax system, to make it simpler for both users
and the TRA. Specifically, Section 56, the second schedule,
Section 7 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and the Stamp Duty
Act were the most complex areas, whereas the Infrastructure
Tax Act was found to be the simplest tax law.
Moreover, the Zanzibar tax regime was found to be com-
plex and uncertain and it imposed a heavy burden on the
tourism sector, both in terms of the amount of tax paid and
the administrative burden. The Ministry for Finance should
issue more detailed regulations concerning the tax laws and
should implement rules whereby these regulations should
clarify any uncertainty and areas identified as being complex
should be given practical examples. Furthermore, it would
be helpful to collate and circulate data from time to time and
to publicize the results of proceedings and the differences of
opinion between the TRA, the ZRB, or local government
authorities (LGAs) and the taxpayer.
Furthermore, the creation of binding rules, a "prior
taxation agreement" (with characteristics similar to the
"rulings" existing in other countries and in mainland
Tanzania under Section 11 of the Tax Administration Act,
2015), would ensure that taxpayers would be certain, in
terms of Zanzibar's domestic taxes, about the taxation for
a specific transaction or activity before engaging in it.
Certainty could also be provided for taxpayers in relation
to legislative changes, by ensuring that these are adopted
by them before they come into force. This would enable
taxpayers to establish adequate systems and to incorporate
the legislative framework in their business planning.
Consequently, the Ministry of Finance, working with the
TRA, the ZRB, and local government authorities, should
consolidate taxes to target the same tax base and the same
taxpayer. Without reducing government revenue, excise
duty would become TZS 2000, which would reduce tax
administration costs and the amount of work needed to
collect the excise duty.
The tax administration burden not only consumes gov-
ernment revenue (Mahangila, 2017), but it has also been
discovered that heavier tax burdens can significantly pre-
vent the formation of new enterprises (Braunerhjelm et al.,
2015). Specifically, a 10% increase in taxes might reduce
the formation of businesses by 4%. It is important to reduce
this burden, which could be done through consolidating
taxes and fees, introducing an electronic tax system, avoid-
ing the duplication of information required by the govern-
ment, raising business owners' awareness of new
regulations, and creating One-Stop Centers (Mattia &
Shawn, 2010). This would reduce the number of payments
to one, rather than taxpayers having to make three pay-
ments each time. There should be a combined (single pay-
ment) reporting and collection arrangement for Employers'
Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Pension Fund, and Health
Contributions, because all of them are payable on the 15th
of each month. To simplify the tax regime, social security
contributions, health insurance, and PAYE should be paid
together as one payment (see Figure 4).
Furthermore, the introduction of an electronic system
would enable the ZRB to have access to taxpayers' data,
and the frequency of filing VAT returns should be reduced
to being semiannual, as is done with PAYE, as this would
reduce the bureaucratic burden of businesses. Reducing the
frequency of filing returns and combining tax payments
would also reduce tax administration costs. Moreover,
combining tax payments would not affect the financial
position of any of the stakeholders involved as the tax bur-
den and contribution to it are constant. With public­private
dialogue and partnerships, the tax administration burden
would be a lot less. Future studies should measure the
impact of public­private dialogue on tax reforms. Moreover,
the TRA-Zanzibar and ZRB should simplify the areas of
complexity and uncertainty identified, either by redrafting
the tax laws or their sections, not only because a certain tax
system enables the government to make realistic tax esti-
mations but also because it makes it easier to comply with
tax laws. The provision of comprehensive guidelines is
strongly recommended to reduce the uncertainty and com-
plexity of tax laws. Similarly, a stable and predictable tax
system enhances simplicity of tax laws as taxpayers know
what is expected of them.
Last but not least, the government should avoid frequent
changes in the laws and, when changes are necessary, it
should engage taxpayers in a consultative process through
public­private dialogues. The use of public­private dialogues
when setting policy priorities, informing policy design,
improving legislative proposals, and incorporating feedback
in regulatory implementation is always encouraged (World
Bank Group, 2014). Joint decision making by the private and
public sector usually leads to better policies that are properly
executed. However, as this study focused on the tax adminis-
tration burden, we encourage future studies to obtain insights
into the role of public­private dialogues and partnerships in
tax formulation and administration--the extent, opportuni-
ties, and the gaps--so as to safeguard the interests of the pub-
lic sector without compromising the quality of the business
environment, economic growth, and poverty alleviation.
