Abstract
Integrating housing tenure in Instrumental Motivation Theory predicts a tenure gap in electoral participation,
as homeowners would be more motivated to vote compared with tenants. The empirical question is whether
this effect is causal or rather due to selection into different housing tenures. This question is tackled using
coarsened exact matching (CEM) on data for 19 countries, allowing us to better control for endogeneity.
Even then, homeowners are found to vote more often than tenants. This association is stronger in countries
characterized by a strong pro-homeownership ideology and/or where the financialization of housing markets
turned houses into assets.

Introduction: background and research questions
In many countries, the promotion of homeownership is a policy instrument aimed at achieving
economic, social, and political goals (Bratt, 2012; Dietz and Haurin, 2003). Homeownership was
traditionally used to stabilize the economy and promote growth. More recently, in some countries,

it was believed to function as a private safety net through its association with wealth accumulation
as part of a so-called `asset-based welfare' strategy aimed at empowering low-income households
(Sherraden and McBride, 2010). A social goal of homeownership policy is to rejuvenate deterio-
rated neighborhoods and quell social tensions. Homeownership is also supposed to encourage
home maintenance and neighborhood involvement and improvement. With regard to the political
consequences, it is argued that there is an association between housing tenure (homeownership,
social, or private renting) and political behavior. Homeownership, by giving people a stake in soci-
ety, would promote confidence in government and empower citizens, which, in turn, induces politi-
cal participation and enhances democratic legitimacy (McCabe, 2013).
Recently, several studies addressed the impact of homeownership ­ or rather the potential
to accumulate housing wealth under different housing regimes ­ on welfare attitudes. André
and Dewilde (2016) found homeowners to be less supportive of government redistribution
than tenants. They also found that for homeowners increased financialization of homeowner-
ship was associated with even lower support for redistribution. Ansell (2014) demonstrated
that housing wealth seems to work as a self-supplied insurance against life-course risks, with
owners experiencing house price appreciation becoming less supportive of government redis-
tribution. He, furthermore, showed that right-wing parties respond to changes in voter prefer-
ences based on house price change by cutting down on redistributive spending during housing
booms. While electoral outcomes and policy change are influenced by altered preferences of
voters, these may also derive from changes in voter turnout. Such a tenure gap in electoral
participation is particularly relevant when housing tenure is associated with political cleav-
ages and divergent preferences between owners and tenants on social issues (see Barreto et al.,
2007 for California).
Recent electoral participation research focused on explaining differences in turnout between
social groups across countries, for example, the gender gap (Beauregard, 2014), the class gap
(Anderson and Beramendi, 2012), the educational gap (Armingeon and Schädel, 2014), and the
generational gap (Górecki, 2013). In this article, we research the potential difference in turnout
between homeowners and tenants, that is, the tenure gap in electoral participation.1 To this end, we
integrate the `consequences' of housing tenure into Instrumental Motivation Theory (Franklin,
2001). This theory predicts a higher turnout for those wishing to influence the course of public
policy more because (1) they have more resources that enable them to vote, (2) they are more
involved in politics, (3) they have a higher stake in the outcomes of an election and are mobilized
as such, and (4) institutional arrangements render their vote more consequential, increasing the
likelihood of policy change through electoral dynamics. In this article, we argue that housing ten-
ure may influence instrumental motivation to vote in several different ways.
In general, a positive association between homeownership and voting in local and national
elections is found for the United States, where part of this association is mediated by residential
stability (how long one lives in and is invested in the house and the neighborhood) and financial
investment considerations (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999; McCabe, 2013; Rossi and Weber,
1996). Engelhardt et al. (2010), however, found no effect for low-income homeowners.
However, comparative research on the presumed political consequences of homeownership is
scarce.
A major disadvantage of most studies relates to their weak designs, as it is difficult to disen-
tangle causation from selection with cross-sectional observational data (Zavisca and Gerber,
2016). It is unclear whether the homeownership effect on political behavior is causal or (partly)
due to selection bias (i.e. the endogeneity problem). The latter implies that higher electoral
participation of homeowners versus tenants may simply arise from `common causes' of both
André et al. 243
homeownership and voter turnout, such as more socio-economic resources and higher residential
stability.
We improve upon earlier research in several ways. First, we incorporate homeownership as
a potential determinant of voter turnout into Instrumental Motivation Theory. This means that
we move beyond purely economic models of voting, since Instrumental Motivation Theory
includes mobilization and institutions, besides resources. Second, we elaborate on previous
US-focused research on electoral participation by including 18 European countries and the
United States, using more recent data. This enables us to research contextual differences in the
homeownership effect. Third, we take better account of methodological issues with regard to
selection into homeownership (e.g. Engelhardt et al., 2010; Haurin et al., 2003). Social corre-
lates of homeownership versus renting can largely be attributed to the fact that `different' peo-
ple select into homeownership. Mortgaged homeownership requires a stable income and
employment position and is therefore more common among people in a better socio-economic
position; these characteristics co-vary with electoral participation. Such observable socio-eco-
nomic differences can be controlled for within a multivariate analysis framework. However,
unobserved latent characteristics of people which determine their decision to become a home-
owner (e.g. trust, lifestyle preferences, and psychological traits) may also influence their pro-
pensity to vote (e.g. Dietz and Haurin, 2003; Zavisca and Gerber, 2016). Although potential
selection arising from such omitted variable bias is difficult to tackle with cross-sectional data,
we improve upon earlier research by preprocessing the data using coarsened exact matching
(CEM) (Ho et al., 2007; Iacus et al., 2012).
While we assume that the latent characteristics of individuals potentially increasing their
likelihood of both homeownership and higher electoral participation are similar across countries,
the institutional context (e.g. tax benefits, rent regulation, and social housing) renders it more
likely for some individuals to accumulate savings and to enter homeownership than others. Who
is selected into homeownership is thus conditional on these contextual arrangements and will
differ between countries. Housing regimes ­ defined as the social, political, and economic
organization of the provision, allocation, and consumption of housing (e.g. Kemeny, 1981) ­
influence the costs and benefits of housing tenures, as well as the average length of residence of
owners versus tenants. We therefore take into account housing regimes, the likely selection of
different `types' of people into homeownership by these regimes, as well as their impact on resi-
dential stability of owners versus tenants and on the other mechanisms influencing people's
instrumental motivation to vote.
To summarize, our main research questions read as follows: do homeowners and tenants differ
in their national electoral participation (i.e. tenure gap in turnout)? How does such a tenure gap
vary by housing regime, and how can we explain such variation? We use data from the second
wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) (Jowell and The Central Coordinating Team, 2005) and
the 2004 General Social Survey (GSS) (Davis and Smith, 2004). The 2004 round of the ESS is the
only one where housing tenure is recorded.
Why would homeowners have a higher likelihood to vote than
tenants?
We start this section with a brief literature review on the assumed positive relationship between
homeownership and turnout. Then, we integrate housing tenure as a potential determinant of voter
turnout in Instrumental Motivation Theory.

The homeownership­voting relationship in earlier research
Political science studies addressing the relationship between homeownership and electoral partici-
pation distinguished between two explanations: residential mobility and economic interest
(Johnston, 1987; Kelley et al., 1985; Squire et al., 1987; Studlar et al., 1990). Homeowners are
more residentially stable, which provides the opportunity to build a larger social network. These
extra ties are assumed to encourage electoral participation. Residential mobility in the United
States furthermore implies electoral re-registration, which additionally leads to lower turnout.
Squire et al. (1987), for instance, showed just-moved homeowners to have a lower likelihood to
vote than residentially stable homeowners. Just-moved homeowners have a similar likelihood to
vote than tenants with 7­9years of residential stability. These findings indicate that homeowner-
ship as such and residential stability have separate, independent, effects on voting. In particular,
homeowners are assumed to be more involved in their neighborhood because they want to safe-
guard emotional and financial investments in their property.
The positive association found between homeownership and voting in local and national
elections in the United States was explained by both factors discussed above: residential stabil-
ity and financial investment considerations (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999; McCabe, 2013;
Rossi and Weber, 1996). Other studies used homeownership as a control variable and showed
consistent positive effects on turnout (Geys, 2006; Highton and Wolfinger, 2001; Solt, 2010).
More recently, McCabe (2013) found a positive effect of homeownership on local and national
voting in the United States. There are hardly any comparative turnout studies taking homeown-
ership into account. Glaeser and Sacerdote (2000) found no effect in Germany on local and
national voting, while DiPasquale and Glaeser (1999) found a positive effect of homeowner-
ship on local voting in Germany, and both found an effect of homeownership on local and
national voting in the United States. In the next section, we elaborate on arguments for a posi-
tive effect of homeownership on electoral participation by integrating them into Instrumental
Motivation Theory.
Instrumental motivation theory
Most studies on voting focus on the (class-based) economic explanation of voting (Lewis-Beck
and Stegmaier, 2007). British voter studies, however, show homeownership to cut across traditional
class alignments (Dunleavy, 1979; Johnston, 1987). For instance, Dunleavy (1979) showed prop-
erty ownership to be important for political alignment and related the decreased impact of occupa-
tional class on party choice to increased homeownership. We therefore incorporate homeownership
into the broader theoretical framework of Instrumental Motivation Theory. This theory predicts a
higher turnout for those groups that wish to influence the course of public policy more. Such instru-
mental motivation is promoted by resources, interest in politics, mobilization around specific inter-
ests, and institutional arrangements, for example, the extent to which votes translate into seats
(Blais and Dobrzynska, 1998; Franklin, 2001, 2004).
First, individuals with more resources (knowledge, wealth, time, income, and education) are
more likely to vote because they can more easily overcome the costs of voting (Verba and Nie,
1972). Homeowners by definition own housing wealth (and housing debt) in their primary resi-
dence, while tenants do not. On average, they also hold more financial resources, which made them
able to enter homeownership in the first place (Di, 2005). These resources may thus be endogenous
to the tenure-voting association. We expect differences in voter turnout between homeowners and
tenants across countries to be explained at least partly by such socio-economic differences, that is,
selection into different tenures.
André et al. 245
A second theoretical mechanism explaining a potential tenure gap in voter turnout relates to
interest-based mobilization of homeowners versus tenants. Although the presumed positive
association between homeownership and political participation regularly resurfaces in research
(e.g. Mau, 2015) and policy (e.g. Dutch Government, 2012), this relationship is not easily
explained. The `stake in the system' argument, for instance, implies that homeownership ties
workers to the economic system and the local job market through mortgages (Castells, 1977;
Engels, 1887 [1975]). These are assumed to encourage homeowners to vote for the powers-that-
be in order to ensure stability and protect their housing investment. The interests of owners,
however, often stand in opposition to the interests of tenants. Assuming that political parties will
tailor their programs to different parts of the electorate, both owners and tenants can easily find
a party that suits their needs and interests.2 National debates on the `fairness' of mortgage inter-
est deduction (MID) or on the frustration of tenants who `miss out' on the gains created through
house price inflation (e.g. `generation rent' in the United Kingdom) may thus mobilize both
owners and tenants. The stake-in-the-system argument therefore potentially applies to party
choice, but not to electoral turnout.
We can nevertheless formulate a number of arguments in favor of a positive homeownership
effect on voter turnout. First, as also suggested by Mau (2015), political or economic interests
around homeownership derive from its status as a special kind of resource/asset, related to
"the stability and concreteness of a home, the long-term nature of the investment, the expected asset
appreciation and potential capital gain that could be achieved by selling, the emotional connection
established while inhabiting it and the easy (and often tax-favored) transfer of a home to one's children."
(Mau, 2015: 55)
It is no surprise that in economically precarious times where privatized assets (and debts) comple-
ment labor market incomes and social protection (see also Crouch, 2009), (mortgaged) homeown-
ers are mobilized around policies that favor housing wealth accumulation. Although tenants also
have housing-related interests, the latter revolve mainly around housing services (cost and quality)
and do not represent a private asset, as is the case for homeowners. Second, as a `special' kind of
resource, homeownership positively impacts perceived social status and acts as a symbol of suc-
cess and middle-class achievement. Owned houses are often larger, of better quality, and situated
in better neighborhoods (Rohe and Stegman, 1994). Middle-class aspirations toward `increased
prosperity, security and participation' (Mau, 2015: xi) may encourage homeowners to vote through
social pressure and social control (Feddersen, 2004). Third, individuals who are mobilized by
political parties, unions, and other groups, or are more informed by the media and watch political
news, are expected to have a higher propensity to vote (Rosenstone and Hansen, 1993; Verba et al.,
1995). Such mobilization is easier through existing social networks, and homeowners are, on aver-
age, more residentially stable than tenants. Residential stability provides the opportunity to build
social networks in the neighborhood (McCabe, 2013) and increases civic engagement, while resi-
dential mobility, according to Putnam's (1995) re-potting hypothesis, decreases civic engagement.
Using German panel data, Lancee and Radl (2014), for instance, found that becoming a home-
owner incentivizes engagement in the local community as individuals start volunteering more.
This homeownership effect may arise from a stakeholder effect partly related to the prospect of
residential stability, from social expectations associated with the status of `being a homeowner' or
from increased mobilization through social networks.
Homeownership may thus reinforce the instrumental motivation to vote through various mech-
anisms. While some of these mechanisms are linked to residential stability, others are not.
Therefore (and although previous research mainly looked at local voting), we argue that
246 International Journal of Comparative Sociology 58(3)
homeownership may also influence national voting. Policy outcomes at the national level are
furthermore seen as important drivers of electoral participation (Franklin, 2001). Housing policy
is mainly developed at the national level. For example, housing allowances, MID and property
taxation are national regulations. Debates on the size of the social rental sector, right-to-buy
schemes, and MID are covered by national media (André et al., in press). National parties profile
themselves on their homeownership position. For example, in the United Kingdom, the
Conservative Party presents itself as a homeowners'party (Hamnett, 1999), and in the Netherlands
housing became an important electoral issue for all political parties after the global financial crisis
(GFC) (André et al., in press). Finally, politicians taking part in national elections are often cho-
sen by a local electorate (Gallagher et al., 2006).
From the literature, we can now formulate the following micro-level hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1a. Homeowners have a higher propensity to vote in national elections than tenants
because they have a higher instrumental motivation to do so. Such motivation is derived from
their higher level of resources and from a number of mechanisms enhancing homeownership-
related interests or the perceived social status of homeowners.
Hypothesis 1b. The higher propensity of homeowners to vote in national elections compared
with tenants is partly explained by general differences in socio-economic characteristics that
co-vary with homeownership (selection into homeownership), that is, age, education, income,
political interest, and ideology, as well as by residential stability.
Housing regimes and the tenure gap in voter turnout
While homeownership became the majority tenure in most European countries, this happened in
different time periods and for different reasons, which might further influence the tenure gap in
voting. Tenure structures and housing outcomes result from ideologically driven power relations
underlying qualitatively different institutional arrangements between states, markets, and families.
In comparative research, the social production of housing is captured with the term `housing
regimes' (Dewilde, 2017; Kemeny, 2001, 2005; Matznetter and Mundt, 2012). We expect the
instrumental motivation to vote derived from homeownership to influence the tenure gap in voting.
Various factors play a role in this tenure gap, which are described below.
First, housing regimes `cause' selection because they influence the costs and benefits of differ-
ent tenures, rendering them more or less attainable and attractive for different groups of citizens.
Governments can, for example, broaden or narrow the conditions of access to social housing or
spend public resources on MID, the latter making homeownership more economically beneficial.
Often governments promote homeownership at the expense of renting (Kemeny, 1981; Ronald,
2008). A second impact of housing regimes arises from tenure differences in residential stability.
Homeowners are consistently found to be more residentially stable than tenants (i.e. McCabe,
2013). Reasons for such an effect are financial and emotional investment in the house and neigh-
borhood, integration in the local job market, and higher costs associated with residential mobility.
However, tenants may be more inclined to stay put when protected by stricter rental regulations
(OECD, 2011). Tenure security, in combination with high-quality and affordable rental housing
subject to some form of rent control, encourages tenants to be invested in their house and neighbor-
hood, which, in turn increases the costs of residential mobility. We expect housing regimes, by
causing systematic differences in residential stability between homeowners and tenants, to moder-
ate the relationship between homeownership and voter turnout.
André et al. 247
We distinguish between four regimes: market-based homeownership, family-based homeown-
ership, the unitary rental market regime and post-socialist homeownership. For each regime, we
lay out our expectations pertaining to the instrumental motivation to vote for owners and tenants,
which is derived from (1) selection into homeownership, (2) tenure differences in residential stabil-
ity, and (3) institutional and ideological arrangements around housing influencing social status and
homeownership-related interests. We expect the tenure gap in voter turnout to be larger in regimes
where (a) homeownership is the ideologically preferred tenure and thus more associated with per-
ceived social status and moral expectations; (b) the tenure gap in residential stability is higher; (c)
rental market regulation is less favorable for tenants; and (d) homeownership became more finan-
cialized (as investment motives influence the instrumental motivation to vote).
Housing markets became `financialized' when deregulated mortgage securitization in the
1980s integrated local housing markets into global capital, although this is a geographically une-
ven process. Demand for mortgage lending and credit as well as rising house prices led to specu-
lative bubbles in the United States, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. In this
process, households became more strongly exposed to house price booms and busts, with poten-
tially not only higher rewards (capital gains) but also higher risks, such as indebtedness, interest
rate fluctuations, capital losses, and unaffordability of homeownership for young people (Ronald
and Dewilde, 2017).
While the countries are classified into housing regimes based on characteristics discussed in the
literature (Dewilde, 2017; Kemeny, 1981; Lowe, 2011), in Table 1 we also present some illustrative
indicators taken from several macro-level sources. The data are from or closest to 2004, given that
our survey data are from this year. The table shows, among others, indicators of residential stability
of homeowners and social tenants (expressed as percentage difference compared to a private rental
tenant), strictness of rental regulation in the private rental sector (in terms of the rent control score),
and the extent of housing market financialization (mortgage debt to gross domestic product (GDP)
ratio). The exact sources for Table 1 can be found in the OnlineAppendix (TableA1).Aproblem that
always arises with regime classifications is that selected indicators do not capture the full picture;
the indicators in Table 1 should thus be seen as a means to describe, rather than classify, countries.
The market-based homeownership regime
Countries that are historically characterized by an active pro-homeownership policy, reflecting an
ideological preference for the provision of state-supported mortgaged-based homeownership
(Ronald, 2008), are considered part of the market-based homeownership regime. Homeownership
is seen as the `better' and `natural' tenure, conveying an `adult status' (Colic-Peisker et al., 2015;
Gurney, 1999). Homeownership may thus, more than in other regimes, add to perceived social
status. Since housing is more likely perceived of as a tradable asset, housing wealth expectations
or risks reinforce investment-related interests. Examples of homeownership policies, varying over
time and across countries (Wind et al., 2016), are MID, right-to-buy of council housing, tax exemp-
tions, and high loan-to-value ratios. These countries tend to have a dual rental market (Kemeny,
1995). The young and households with limited income are more often found in the (private) rental
sector, which is lightly regulated. Social housing is shielded from the market, targeted at the poor
and residual ­ and therefore more stigmatized (Kurz and Blossfeld, 2004). The social groups that
are selected into homeownership are also those that are expected to vote more often in elections
(higher incomes, higher education, and older age groups). We include France, Ireland, Iceland,
Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States in this regime. Table 1 illustrates some char-
acteristics of the countries in each regime. For example, the difference in residential stability
between homeowners and private tenants is largest in the market-based homeownership regime,

and rent control in the private sector is limited. Except for France, countries in this regime have
highly financialized mortgage markets (based on mortgage debt to GDP ratio).
The family-based homeownership regime
In the family-based homeownership regime, homeownership is outright and mainly acquired through
self-provision by the extended family, pooling resources across generations to overcome credit con-
straints (Allen et al., 2004). Since housing is a family asset and housing markets are less financialized,
housing is much less tradable and capital gains expectations will affect investment-related interests of
homeowners less.Although the government hardly intervenes in the homeownership market, the hous-
ing trajectory is strongly focused on homeownership and is a prerequisite for family formation (Poggio,
2013). We therefore assume homeownership in this regime to be more strongly associated with social
status. The social rental sector is shielded from the market, but small (dual rental market) and most
low-income households live in family-owned housing (Allen et al., 2004). Compared to the market-
based homeownership regime, we expect that the private rental sector mostly caters for young house-
holds that did not make the transition to homeownership yet and for poor households (who are less
politically active than the young). We include Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain in this regime. Table
1 shows that the housing market in the family-based regime is less financialized (although housing
market opportunities and risks may play a role in Spain and Portugal), rent control in the private rental
sector is slightly stricter, and differences in residential stability between tenures are more moderate.
The unitary rental market regime
The unitary rental market regime is found in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and
Switzerland. A unitary rental market is characterized by relatively small differences between the
social and private rental sectors (Hoekstra, 2009; Kemeny, 1995; Lowe, 2011). Historically, private
landlords were allowed to enter a state-managed market in exchange for state subsidies. Rent con-
trol (as a proxy for strictness of rental regulation) is thus highest in this regime (see Table 1). The
ensuing competition between public and private housing providers results in good-quality and
affordable housing across rental tenures and income groups (Dewilde, 2017). In Germany, strong
increases in the private rental stock since the 1990s arose from the privatization of public housing
associated with the termination of subsidy arrangements. Both rental sectors, however, remain
fairly strictly regulated. The level of social housing is thus only of secondary importance for the
classification of Germany into the unitary rental regime.
In this regime, all tenures are more or less state-supported. Lower income groups have access to
better-quality rental housing, while the middle-income groups can choose between homeownership
and renting. Higher income groups are generally in homeownership. We expect the perceived social
status effect to be smaller in this regime, although selection bias is more likely. As the social rental
sector is not marginalized, residential stability is higher compared to homeowners (OECD, 2011).
Homeowners are more residentially stable than private tenants (see Table 1) at rates comparable to
the family-based homeownership regime. In recent decades, housing markets became strongly
financialized in a subgroup of countries, that is, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Homeownership-
related economic interests thus provide a possible instrumental motivation to vote.
The post-socialist homeownership regime
Homeownership is extremely high and mostly non-mortgaged in the post-socialist regime, compa-
rable to the family-based regime. This is the outcome of privatization, that is, the sale of
250 International Journal of Comparative Sociology 58(3)
state-owned rental housing to tenants for below-market prices and the restitution of property to
pre-communist owners. Houses are, however, often unfit and in bad condition while shared by
generations (Lux et al., 2013; Mandic and Clapham, 1996). This means that the benefits normally
associated with homeownership compared to renting are less evident. The lack of development in
housing finance following privatization of state-provided housing furthermore implies that invest-
ment-related considerations do not play a role. The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia
belong to this regime. Differences in residential stability between owners and private tenants are
lowest in this regime, as evident from Table 1. Renting is a transitional tenure consisting of residu-
alized social housing and illegal private renting (Lux et al., 2016).
We formulate the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2a. A larger tenure gap in voter turnout in the market-based homeownership regime
is likely to arise from several different sources: selection bias, tenure differences in residential
stability, perceived social status of homeownership, and (mobilization around) homeownership-
related interests in a financialized housing market.
Hypothesis 2b. Compared with the market-based homeownership regime, the tenure gap in
voter turnout is smaller in the family-based homeownership regime (less likely selection bias
and less mobilization around housing-related interests) and in the unitary rental market regime
(less tenure differences in residential stability) ­ although some of these differences are partially
controlled for in the micro-models.
Hypothesis 2c. The tenure gap in voter turnout in the post-socialist homeownership regime will
be non-significant, as potential selection bias is minimal and all tenures have high residential
stability. Housing tenure is far less associated with the mechanisms predicting a positive remain-
ing homeownership effect derived from the instrumental motivation to vote, that is, perceived
social status and homeownership-related economic interests.
Data and methods
We use data for 18 European countries from the 2004 ESS (Jowell and The Central Coordinating
Team, 2005) and the 2004 GSS for the United States (Davis and Smith, 2004). We are limited to
2004, as this is the only round of the ESS which contains high-quality data on both tenure and politi-
cal behavior for all European countries. This may be a distinctive year since it is in the middle of the
housing boom. However, following the economic and housing crisis of 2007­2008, governments
did not fundamentally change their policies toward homeownership; they rather protected housing
markets and (mortgaged) homeowners. Unfortunately, there are no comparative datasets in which
information on housing tenure, political participation, and residential stability are included at the
same time. We therefore combine data from different sources and approximate length of residence.
Variables
We coded whether people voted in the last national election (1) or not (0) and excluded those not
eligible to vote. We coded whether any member of the household owned the dwelling (yes (1)/no
(0)), excluding young adults and students living at home. We unfortunately have no information on
the type of rental housing (public/private/rent-free).
Control variables. Control variables are included in order to minimize the possibility that `common
causes' of both homeownership and voting are confounding a potential tenure effect on
André et al. 251
voter turnout. To control for individual-level differences in political resources and engagement
with politics, control variables often used in research on electoral participation (Beauregard, 2014;
Franklin, 2004) are included. Age is calculated from the year of birth and centered. Gender is
recoded into female (1). Education is measured as (1) primary education and not-completed sec-
ondary education; (2) secondary education completed; (3) post-secondary/tertiary, bachelor, mas-
ter completed; and (4) education missing. Income is measured as the country-specific relative
household income percentile. Marital status is measured with four dummies as `married or living
together', `single', `divorced', and `widowed'. Urban/rural living is measured as `big city', `sub-
urbs', `small city', and `rural area'. Occupational status is operationalized by means of the Inter-
national Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), indicating the cultural and economic
resources typical for different occupations (Ganzeboom and Treiman, 2014). For those who did not
have a valid score, because they were housewives, long-term unemployed, or did not answer the
question, the mean score was imputed and a dummy variable flags this imputation. Internal politi-
cal efficacy is measured as low (1)/middle (2)/high (3) based on the average on the items `politics
is too complicated to understand' and `making my mind up on political issues is hard' for ESS
countries and with the question `most people in America are better informed about politics than I
am' for the United States. Political ideology is measured as left/democrat (1) versus middle/inde-
pendent (2) versus right/republican (3), using the left­right self-placement scale of ESS and the
`feel closer to party' variable from GSS. Political interest is measured as interested (1) versus not
interested (0). Political trust is operationalized as the mean score on the partisan trust items in the
survey, because only trust in partisan institutions would enhance voter turnout (Rothstein and
Stolle, 2008).3
Length of residence. Length of residence refers to the number of years a respondent lived in the cur-
rent house based on the date of purchase or of the first lease. Unfortunately, this information was
not available in the 2004 waves of ESS and GSS. Therefore, we used other data sources and
imputed a proxy for length of residence. Length of residence was calculated from European Union
Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU SILC, 2005) for all countries, except Norway
(EU-SILC 2006) and Switzerland (EU-SILC 2011).4 We made the sample selection comparable to
ESS and GSS, randomly selected one person per household, and measured the length of residence
based on the date of purchase or of installment of the rental contract. We calculated the average
length of residence for groups of respondents based on age (18-35, 36-50, 51-65, 65+), gender,
married or not, education (low, middle, and high), and tenure (homeowner and tenant). We calcu-
lated the length of residence for the United States with the 2002 GSS and for the Netherlands with
the 2006 wave of the LISS panel.5 Since older people are more likely to have lived longer in their
house, there is a high correlation between length of residence and age (r=0.70).6 We matched
respondents (see the next section) on both variables. This also implies that we cannot test specific
hypotheses on the length of residence effect. We do, however, control for length of residence in the
best possible way, given the data at hand. Descriptive statistics of all variables used in the analyses
can be found in Table 2.
Analytical strategy
Earlier studies on the relationship between homeownership and electoral participation used multi-
variate (and sometimes multilevel) logistic regression analysis with various approaches to the endo-
geneity problem (i.e. selection bias). In observational data, the treatment assignment (in our case
homeownership) is not controlled by the investigator; this compromises causal inference. Put differ-
ently, selection into homeownership makes it difficult to assess whether a positive association
252 International Journal of Comparative Sociology 58(3)
between homeownership and turnout is explained by instrumental motivations to vote or by charac-
teristics of people that make them more likely to both vote and be a homeowner. McCabe (2013)
used placebo measures to control for selection into homeownership, while others used instrumental
variable modeling (Aaronson, 2000; DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999). We tackled this issue in two
ways. First, as discussed above and based on the political science and housing literature, we selected
appropriate control variables that potentially confound the voting­tenure relationship. Second, for a
better and stricter test, we preprocessed our data by means of CEM (Blackwell et al., 2009).
CEM is a straightforward way to improve causal inference from survey data through matching.
Matching is a non-parametric data preprocessing approach to control for the confounding influence
of pretreatment variables and to reduce statistical bias and model dependence (Ho et al., 2007). As
the matching procedure balances out owners and tenants in terms of their observed covariates, this
method mainly does a better job of controlling for observables. However, to the extent that the
observed variables are correlated with unobservable characteristics associated with tenure out-
comes, the likelihood that the latter are balanced out is higher as well (Iacus et al., 2012). In par-
ticular, we argue that by matching on political trust ­ a variable which is arguably correlated with

a number of unobservable traits, for example, general social trust ­ we are able to better control for
factors endogenous to the tenure­voting association and are therefore also better equipped to eval-
uate a potential tenure effect on voting.
Traditionally, exact matching (one-to-one) would be used and yield a limited number of matches
by pairing treated units to control units with the same values on covariates. Including continuous
variables would almost automatically imply no matches. CEM provides a solution to this problem
by temporarily coarsening (categorizing) continuous variables into meaningful groups, which
makes the likelihood of a match higher and prunes less cases. By subsequently including the origi-
nal uncoarsened variables in the models and performing statistical estimations, we end up with a
better balanced dataset without losing too many observations. Concretely, we categorized all inde-
pendent variables (including imputed length of residence and political characteristics)7 and
matched, per country, each tenant with these specific characteristics to a homeowner with the same
characteristics. Applying CEM reduced the global imbalance of our dataset from 1.0 (total imbal-
ance) to 0 (complete balance), which means that we have complete balance on the (coarsened)
covariates (for more information on CEM, see Iacus et al., 2012). The number of respondents
decreased from 31,097 to 12,323. We reran the models on all data with the preprocessed data and
also included the original uncoarsened variables that we matched on because these have more vari-
ation than the dummies used in the matching process (Blackwell et al., 2009).
The matching procedure also provides a solution for the high correlation between age and length
of residence (r=0.77). This correlation is high by default. Since we have no direct measurement of
length of residence and imputed a proxy from other data sources (based on age, education, gender,
tenure, and marital status), these were all correlated. Since all of these variables were used in the
CEM, we are able to bypass this multicollinearity problem. This, however, also implies that we
cannot attach any meaning, except for `controlled for', to our length of residence measure.
Normally, when analyzing multiple countries, multilevel analysis is applied to account for the
clustering of individuals in countries. However, because our intra-class correlation is low (0.08),
we use linear regression analysis with the clustered standard errors option in STATA. We also pro-
vide the results of identical models controlling for country fixed effects in the Online Appendix
(results are robust).8
Mood (2010) showed that odds ratios cannot be interpreted as effect measures because they also
reflect the unobserved heterogeneity in the model, which can differ between models or groups. To
test mediation and interaction models, it is better to use linear probability models (LPMs), which
yield unbiased and consistent estimates of a variable's average effect on the chance that the event
occurs. This means that we will run linear regression models although having a binary dependent
variable. The b-coefficients in LPM can be read as average marginal effects on the likelihood of
voting (Matter and Stutzer, 2014). We present the individual-level models in Table 3 and the coun-
try-level models in Table 4.
Results
Our general micro-level hypothesis (Hypothesis 1a) predicted homeowners to have a higher
propensity to vote in national elections compared with tenants because of their higher instrumen-
tal motivation derived from more `enabling' resources and from a number of social mechanisms
which enhance perceived social status and homeownership-related considerations. Table 3 shows
the individual-level results of the LPMs with country-clustered standard errors. Model 1 (uncon-
trolled estimates) confirms our hypothesis as homeowners are 13percentage points more likely
to vote in national elections than tenants. We assumed this association to be (partly) explained
by general differences in socio-economic characteristics that co-vary with homeownership
254 International Journal of Comparative Sociology 58(3)
(`selection into homeownership'), as well as by residential stability differences between owners
and tenants. Therefore, we control for these characteristics in Model 2a. The estimate for `home-
ownership' becomes smaller (10 percentage points) but remains significant. Since we control
for, among others, age, income, and education, we can safely set aside the argument that resources
alone are responsible for the association between tenure and voter turnout. In Model 2b, we use
our preprocessed dataset, which has a better balance of homeowners and tenants and potentially
provides more certainty as to whether the `treatment' effect of homeownership is `real', rather
than arising from pretreatment confounders which remained unmeasured, such as, for example,
trust, lifestyle preferences, and personality traits. Model 2b is thus the strictest test possible with
the data at hand. We find that the `homeowner' estimate is reduced from 13 to 7
percentage
points between Models 1 and 2b, which is a significant reduction (2=10.90, p=0.004).

Homeowners are still 7percentage points more likely to vote in national elections than tenants.
These findings are in line with H1b, as at least part of the effect arises from the `consequences
of being a homeowner', for example, through perceived social status or homeownership-related
(investment) considerations.

Hypothesis 2 predicted the tenure gap in voter turnout to be largest in the market-based home-
ownership regime, followed by the family-based homeownership regime and unitary rental mar-
ket regime (the latter regimes having more or less comparable tenure gaps). We expected a
non-significant tenure gap in the post-socialist homeownership regime. Figure 1 shows the esti-
mate for the effect of `homeownership' on voter turnout for each regime and country separately
(before matching). The first bar is the uncontrolled estimate and the second bar is the `controlled'
estimate, including a control for our proxy of length of residence. When the tenure gap is statisti-
cally significant, the bar is dark gray; when it is not significant the bar is light gray.9 For example,
in the United Kingdom the controlled probability of a homeowner to vote in national elections is
8 percentage points higher than for a tenant, and this difference is significant. We indeed find the
tenure gap in voting to be largest in the market-based homeownership regime (in line with
Hypothesis 2a), while the gap is smaller in ­ but does not differ between ­ the family-based home-
ownership regime and the unitary rental market regime (in line with Hypotheses 2b). In line with
Hypothesis 2c, the homeownership estimate is no longer significant for the post-socialist home-
ownership regime when controlling for measured socio-economic resources and for our proxy for
residential stability.
In the market-based homeownership regime, we find large and significant estimates for `being
a homeowner' for all countries, except Iceland. In the family-based homeownership regime, esti-
mates are only significant for Spain and Greece. A possible explanation is that house prices
increased more in Spain and Greece between 2001 and 2004 than in Italy and Portugal (European
Mortgage Federation (EMF), 2009), making investment-related considerations a possible driver of
electoral participation for homeowners. The differences between the controlled and uncontrolled
tenure gaps in Greece and Spain are rather small, indicating that resource-based selection into
homeownership matters less. In the unitary rental market regime, estimates are, on average, half of
those for the market-based homeownership regime.
Additional information on Hypotheses 2a­c is provided in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 shows results
from LPMs with country-clustered standard errors. The tenure gap in voting for each regime can
be calculated from the interaction estimate for the regime and the main effect of `homeownership'
(which refers to the tenure gap in the market-based homeownership regime). These tenure gaps are
presented separately in Table 5. Model 1 presents the uncontrolled tenure gap in each regime,
Model 2a shows the tenure gap controlled for measured socio-economic differences, length of resi-
dence, and political variables, and Model 2b shows the controlled tenure gap using CEM, with
controls for the coarsened variables. In part A of Table 5, the tenure gap (i.e. the `homeownership'
effect) is shown, as well as an indication of its level of statistical significance. In part B, the
decrease in the tenure gap compared to Model 1 is shown, alongside an indication of the level of
statistical significance of this decrease, based on a 2 test.
Table 5 shows the extent to which the tenure gap for each regime is reduced after including
control variables (M2a). The tenure gap is reduced further when in Model 2b we control, as far as
possible with cross-sectional data (through matching), for selection bias not captured by observed
differences in socio-economic resources. The absolute decreases in the market-based homeowner-
ship regime (11percentage points), the family-based homeownership regime (8percentage points),
and the unitary rental market regime (7
percentage points) are larger than in the post-socialist
homeownership regime (5percentage points), where less selection was expected. The `remaining'
effect is, as hypothesized, largest in the market-based homeownership regime, followed by the
unitary rental market regime and the family-based homeownership regime (which do not signifi-
cantly differ from each other), while it is no longer significant in the post-socialist homeownership
regime. These findings are in line with Hypotheses 2a­c.10

tenure gaps, and therefore, the numbers slightly differ from Table 4.
258 International Journal of Comparative Sociology 58(3)
When controlling for differences in socio-economic resources as well as tenure-differences
in residential stability and likely selection, differences between housing regimes diminish con-
siderably. However, the tenure gap in voter turnout ­ be it of a smaller size ­ still remains sig-
nificant in all regimes, except the post-socialist homeownership regime. Other explanations are
thus needed in order to explain the higher turnout of homeowners versus tenants. Put differ-
ently, we cannot rule out that homeowners are encouraged to vote through instrumental motiva-
tions related to perceived social status or homeownership-related (investment) considerations.
This is supported by our finding that the tenure gap is highest in countries characterized by a
strong pro-homeownership ideology and/or where the financialization of housing markets
turned owned homes into assets.
Conclusion and discussion
While policymakers and politicians in Europe and the United States justify pro-homeownership
policies by referring to its presumed economic, social, and political benefits, we researched whether
such a tenure effect can be established with regard to electoral participation for 19 countries.
Expansion of homeownership was promoted to include and empower low-income households,
although the (financial) limitations of these strategies became painfully clear after the GFC
(Schwartz, 2012). Nevertheless, as housing and housing wealth are central to the welfare provision
of households and to the overall political economy, and will remain so in the foreseeable future, it
is relevant to research whether the presumed positive effect of homeownership on political partici-
pation is causal or rather due to selection into different housing tenures.
We integrated housing tenure in Instrumental Motivation Theory and expected a higher turnout
of homeowners versus tenants based on perceived social status and economic considerations. In

order to tackle ­ to the best of our abilities ­ issues with regard to selection bias, potential effects
arising from tenure differences in residential stability, and general data limitations, a variety of
methodological tools were used, such as matching (CEM) and the use of an imputed measure for
residential stability. The latter means that we have to be cautious with our measure of residential
stability. We furthermore `approximated' different explanations for the tenure gap in voting by
exploiting cross-country differences in contextual arrangements.
We indeed found a tenure gap in national election participation, and the positive estimate of
`homeownership' on voting varied in a systematic way across countries and housing regimes. At
the micro-level, we found the tenure gap to be partly explained by differences in socio-economic
resources (although a significant effect remained), tenure differences in residential stability, and
`additional' selection bias potentially captured through matching. At the macro-level, we showed
the tenure effect to be largest in the market-based homeownership regime and smaller in the fam-
ily-based homeownership regime and the unitary rental market regime. In the post-socialist home-
ownership regime, homeowners are no more likely to vote than tenants after controlling for likely
confounders. We therefore cannot rule out that homeowners are encouraged to vote through instru-
mental motivations related to perceived social status or homeownership-related (investment) con-
siderations. This is supported by our finding that the tenure gap is highest in countries characterized
by a strong pro-homeownership ideology, and/or where the financialization of housing markets
turned owned homes into assets. A limitation of this study is that with the data at hand, we cannot
distinguish between these different motives. This should be addressed in future data collection and
research projects.
Part of the difference in the tenure gap in voting between countries might be attributed to regis-
tration differences, which may somehow co-vary with housing regimes. When tenants move more
often than homeowners, this may compromise electoral registration, which would in turn lower
electoral participation (Kemp and Kofner, 2010). Although this is a possibility, we still find similar
estimates in the country fixed-effects models,11 in which all unobserved heterogeneity between
countries is controlled for, for example, aspects of the electoral system (Franklin, 2004).
Future research should address two other limitations of our study: causality and a measure for
residential stability. Although we controlled for the possibility that people who are more likely to
vote are also more likely to buy a house in the strictest way possible with the cross-sectional data
at hand, we cannot be sure that we captured all possible confounders. If there are `omitted varia-
bles' that confound the association between housing tenure and voting but are not related to the
ones we included, CEM will not be a fix to the causality issue. Furthermore, we only approximated
residential stability at the micro-level and can therefore not explicitly test for this mechanism.
Future research would thus be advised to use panel data (and therefore probably focus on one or
several countries) to overcome these limitations.
Since we only researched voter turnout, we cannot comment on the association between home-
ownership and other forms of political participation. Although voting is the key political act in all
countries under study, other indicators (e.g. membership of political parties) vary more strongly or
have different meanings across countries. It would be interesting to replicate this research with
more recent data, as the GFC has placed housing at the core of economic and public policy debates
(André et al., in press), and recent housing market dynamics and trends affect outcomes for and
interests of homeowners and tenants in several different ways.
Finally, the hypothesized (positive) homeownership effect on voting in national elections is
present, but part of this effect is caused by selection into homeownership. There is no significant
tenure gap in the post-socialist countries, as well as in five other countries. Better measurements
potentially would allow for a `complete' explanation of the tenure gap in more countries. Finally,
housing regime differences in the tenure gap point at motivations related to both perceived social
260 International Journal of Comparative Sociology 58(3)
status and self-interested investment-related concerns around homeownership as an asset and wel-
fare resource. Policy-makers should therefore be more cautious when promoting homeownership
based on the argument that it turns people into `better citizens' (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999).
Homeownership may affect one's interests, but it does not change one's character.

Notes
1. Other forms of political participation, like signing a petition or joining a demonstration, had a much
lower incidence (<20%) in most countries. We thus focus on voting, which is also most connected to
housing policy.
 2. Although protest voting to signal dissatisfaction is a possibility, we have no theoretical argument why
this would occur more often for homeowners or tenants.
 3. Political knowledge or political exposure was not available.
 4. Although the data for Switzerland are more recent (2011) than the survey year (2004), figures from the
Statistical Office of Switzerland show that tenure changes were limited. Homeownership increased by
5 percent between 2000 and 2010. For Norway, the data are 2years older, and we do not think that the
average length of residence changed much in Norway between 2004 and 2006. We also ran our analyses
without Norway and Switzerland as a robustness check; this did not change the results.
5. The descriptive statistics of length of residence per regime can be found in the Online Appendix
(Table A9).
 6. A correlation matrix can be found in the Online Appendix (Table A1).
7. The list with all variables and how they were dichotomized can be found in the Online Appendix
(Table A2).
 8. We also provide separate analyses for each housing regime in the Online Appendix (Table A5). We find
that the same variables are correlated with the tenure gap in voter turnout in each regime, and that the
control variables are in the expected direction or in some cases not significant.
 9. The coefficients and standard errors can be found in the Online Appendix (Table A6).
10. Although our R2 values (variance explained) are low, this is not unusual. Gorecki et al. (2013) report
R2 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.10, and Isakson et al. (2014) report values that range from 0.09 to
0.13. Furthermore, the important thing is that we do not aim to explain voter turnout in these countries
by including all possible measures of electoral systems. Our main focus lies in the tenure gap in elec-
toral participation. Our models with country fixed effects have, by definition, higher R2 values because
they take into account all country-level differences, including arrangements regarding electoral systems.
Therefore, we do not think that our relatively low explained variances are problematic.

Luxembourg has MID (Donner, 2000).
Czech Republic has MID (Jahoda and Godarová, 2014)
Hungary has MID (Donner, 2006)
Poland has MID (Donner, 2006)
Slovenia has MID (3%; Donner, 2006) also housing finance network.org
Slovakia has no MID (Donner, 2006)
United States has MID (housing-finance-network.org) `This unlimited,

Rent control score Rent control data are on the private rental sector from 2009, based on
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
Housing and the Economy file (OECD_47431120.xls), Figure 19.
Dualist/unitary According to Kemeny (1995): Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and
Switzerland are unitary rental systems. The United Kingdom is a dualist
rental system. Hoekstra (2009) also classifies Austria and Denmark as
unitary and Belgium and Ireland as dualist. Kemeny (1995) states that
Anglo-Saxon countries (like the UK, New Zealand, and Australia) are
dualist and therefore we also classify the United States as dualist. If we
look at the macro-indicators for the countries that have already been
categorized, we see, like Hoekstra (2009), that in dualist countries
homeownership rates are high and social rental rates are low. The other
countries in our sample are categorized as dualist, except for France,
because of the relatively large social rental sector. Other data to inform
our choice were from Donner (2000, 2006).
Housing benefits as

Data are from the Public Expenditures Database of the OECD (Housing/
Housing Assistance as percentage of GDP). For Slovenia, we use the
number from Donner (Donner, 2006: 214).
