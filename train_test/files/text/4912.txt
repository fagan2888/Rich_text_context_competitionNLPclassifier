Introduction
The prevalence of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS)
is high, estimated at 15% to 30% of all primary care consul-
tations (Kirmayer et al., 2004; Steinbrecheret al., 2011). The
most common unexplained symptoms in medical and para-
medical practice are musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain or
gastrointestinal symptoms, ear, nose, and throat symptoms,
dizziness and fatigue (Kirmayer et al., 2004). Together with
bodily symptoms, patients with MUS often show a lack of
self-confidence and trust in their body (Gyllensten et al.,
2010). Despite high medical consumption behavior and cor-
responding attention, MUS patients do not often recover
(Smith et al., 2005). This can be due to the health care system
where there is a strong tendency to conceptualize the body as
an objective, pure physical body and to interpret symptoms
as an underlying biological dysfunction (Bullington, 2009).
Yet, for a therapist, it seems to be important to not merely
pay attention to the physical or objective body of the patient
but also to the subjective or experienced body (Bullington,
2009; Wilde, 2003).
According to the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, the
body is simultaneously objective and subjective. The body as
an object is the body we have, the pure physical body. The
body as a subject is the body we are, our body as interpreter
(Bullington, 2009; Wilde, 2003). This makes a phenomeno-
logical approach fundamental in understanding MUS (Ter
Meulen & Van Woerkom, 2009). The concept used by
Merleau-Ponty to describe this human experience of having
and being a body at the same time, is called "embodiment."
Embodiment conceptualizes the body as a dynamic, organic
place of meaningful experience rather than a physical object
distinct from the self or the mind (Mehling et al., 2011).
Fibromyalgia (FM) is part of a broad category of "func-
tional somatic symptoms" (FSS) or MUS (Kanaan, Lepine,
& Wessely, 2007; Sarzi-Puttini et al., 2012). In the former
diagnostic criteria, FM was characterized--in addition to the
sensitivity on at least 11 of 18 tender points--by chronic

How Do Fibromyalgia Patients With
Alexithymia Experience Their Body? A
Qualitative Approach
Joeri Calsius1, Imke Courtois1, Jolien Stiers1, and Jozef De Bie2
Abstract
Patients suffering from chronic pain such as fibromyalgia (FM) not only experience change in their physical bodies but
also in their embodiment. There are two forms of disturbed body awareness (BA), namely, "disembodiment" and "hyper-
embodiment." This study describes how patients with FM experience their body and whether there is a difference in BA with
or without alexithymia. Based on two self-report questionnaires (Toronto Alexithymia Scale [TAS]-20 and Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale [HADS]), a purposeful sample of FM patients with and without alexithymia was included. Two focus
groups were conducted with nine alexithymic and six nonalexithymic FM patients and were analyzed by a Interpretative
Phenomenological Analysis. Body experience appeared in two themes: "the lived body as hyper present" and "alienation
from the lived body." A third theme emerged as "the lived body in interaction with others" and indicates the importance
of the interpersonal aspect of BA. We found no differences regarding BA between the alexithymic and nonalexithymic
patients. These results suggest that BA in FM patients cannot exclusively be classified under the constructs of hyper- or
disembodiment. The authors suggest to consider embodiment in FM, subjected to intra- as well as interindividual influences,
as a dimensional construct whereby the equilibrium tends to hyper-embodiment. Still, a temporary shift of this equilibrium
from hyper- to disembodiment due to certain emotional state or stress is possible. As alexithymia had no influence on the
description of BA, it seems that FM patients primarily fail to express their BA without in fact being disembodied.

widespread musculoskeletal pain. Recently, the criteria have
been adapted with less emphasis on tender points (Wolfe,
2010). Patients with FM also report symptoms of fatigue,
sleep disorders, stiffness and cognitive dysfunctions (Sarzi-
Puttini et al., 2012; Van Houdenhove & Luyten, 2008).
Patients suffering chronic pain such as FM not only experi-
ence changes in their physical body but also in their embodi-
ment (Wilde, 2003). In general psychiatry, there are two
forms of disturbed body awareness described in relation to
(chronic) pain, namely "disembodiment" and "hyper-
embodiment." Disembodiment refers to an individual who is
not connected with his or her body. In case of hyper-embodi-
ment, the person is totally immersed in pain (Wilde, 2003).
In this state of hyper-embodiment, psychological experi-
ences are experienced as "too real." Such concrete thinking
makes psychological pain being felt as physical pain (Luyten
& Fonagy, 2011). However, in a state of hyper-embodiment,
the body can also be experienced as very pleasant, comfort-
able, and as a source of pleasure (Zeiler, 2010). In literature,
hyper- and disembodiment are already described in the con-
text of respectively, melancholic depression and schizophre-
nia (Fuchs & Schlimme, 2009). Table 1 shows the
characteristics of both concepts according to Fuchs and
Schlimme (2009). In addition, chronic pain not only has a
negative influence on the perception of the self but also on
the experiential world in which the individual lives (Afrell et
al., 2007; Bullington, 2009).
Alexithymia is a personality trait that is characterized by
difficulties in recognizing, differentiating, and verbalizing
emotional states, by an externally oriented cognitive style and
poor fantasy. Literally, alexithymia means "no words for feel-
ings." Related to these central features, the alexithymic indi-
vidual is thought to be characterized by a disembodied state
of being in the world, unable to contact with his body and the
bodily or emotional state he is in, which in turn could be
related to poor mentalization capacity (Maclaren, 2006;
Spaans et al., 2009; Vanheuleet al., 2011). Alexithymia is
considered as a continuous or dimensional trait, which is also
found in general population, and is studied in relation to
MUS. Important to note is that alexithymia is not considered
a disorder itself, nor is it typical for a specific disorder
(Lumley et al., 2007). Alexithymia is rather seen as a person-
ality trait that is associated with a higher vulnerability to men-
tal disorders, mainly depression and anxiety (Leweke
et al., 2012; Rief & Broadbent, 2007). The latter are two com-
mon comorbidities in MUS (Castelli et al., 2012; Henningsen
et al., 2003; Sayar et al., 2004; Steinweg et al., 2011).
FM has not yet been described in terms of hyper- or dis-
embodiment. Taking into account the characteristics of
hyper- and disembodiment (as described in Table 1), a num-
ber of studies have explored the "lived experience" in FM
patients (Hellström et al., 1999; McMahon et al., 2012;
Paulson et al., 2002; Råheim et al.,1999, 2002), which usu-
ally describes both concepts. Characteristics that endorse
hyper-embodiment are the lived body that becomes dis-
rupted, apprehended as a physical entity and experienced as
hyper present (Söderberg et al., 1999, 2002); the body is
described as an obstacle, a barrier that prevents access to the
world (idem); completely absorbed by the pain, the body is
pain (Råheim & Håland, 2006). Related to disembodiment,
the following characteristics are present: the body is experi-
enced at a distance and the body as an alien presence impos-
sible to control (idem).
The primary purpose of the study is to describe how FM
patients experience their body. Secondly, possible differ-
ences between body awareness in FM patients with and with-
out alexithymia are explored. The objective is to understand
the meaningful experience of the body in FM patients and
not to search for a causal relationship.
Method
A phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, namely, the
Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis or IPA was used
for this study as phenomenology emphasizes the immediacy
of experience and not the measurability of reality as such

(Howitt, 2013). The primary concern of IPA is with how
individuals experience phenomena and the psychological
interpretations of these experiences. This study was approved
by the ethics committee of the Hospital Zuid Oost-Limburg
Genk, in collaboration with the ethics committee of the
University of Hasselt.
Measurements Sampling Strategy
The 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) is a self-
report scale that contains 20 items, divided into three sub-
scales: (a) difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF), (b)
difficulties in describing feelings (DDF), and (c) externally
oriented thinking (EOT). The TAS-20 has been translated
into 18 languages. The Dutch version also shows strong psy-
chometric properties (Kooiman et al., 2002; Tayloret al.,
2003). Cutoff points were used to label patients as nonalex-
ithymic (sum score  51) and alexithymic (sum score  61).
Levels of anxiety and depression were measured with the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This ques-
tionnaire contains two subscales, a seven-item depression
scale (HADS-D) and a seven-item anxiety scale (HADS-A).
For both subscales, scores 8 indicate a possible depression
or anxiety disorder (Snaith & Zigmond, 1994). The HADS is
seen as a valid and reliable tool in assessing the symptom
severity of anxiety disorders and depression in a healthy,
somatic, psychiatric, and primary care patient population
(Bjelland et al., 2002; Herrmann, 1997). The Dutch version
also shows good psychometric properties.
Population
The population was selected with a purposeful sampling
strategy. This sampling strategy was directed toward FM
patients with both high and low scores for alexithymia. Other
variables, such as sociodemographic data and the number of
years since diagnosis, were allowed to differ. Figure 1 shows
the recruitment process. The FM patients were recruited in
"Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg" (ZOL) in Belgium (Genk) and
in 10 different physical therapist practices. A total of 75 self-
report questionnaires (TAS-20 and HADS) were distributed,
which the patients had to return to the researchers. The
response rate was 40%. Based on this, patients were selected
with a score of 61 on the TAS-20 (n = 11). However, the
patients who scored low--that is, a score of 51--on the
TAS-20 (n = 7)--were also selected. The selected patients
were contacted by phone to ask for their willingness to par-
ticipate in a focus group. Nine alexithymic and five nonalex-
ithymic patients gave permission. Finally, four patients with
a score of 53 on the TAS-20 were contacted and agreed to
participate. These four patients were classified in the non-
alexithymic group. In this last group, three participants did
not show up.
All participants were women diagnosed with FM (accord-
ing to the American College of Rheumatology [ACR] crite-
ria). The mean age was 43 years in the nonalexithymic group
and 46 years in the alexithymic group. The number of years
since diagnosis ranged from 1 to 11 years (mean = 8.5 years)
in the nonalexithymic group and from 2 to 20 years (mean =
5.8 years) in the alexithymic group. The results from the two
questionnaires are shown in Table 2. The average anxiety
and depression scores for the alexithymic patients were situ-
ated above the cutoff score (i.e., 8). The average HADS-
score of 12.7 for anxiety and 13 for depression indicate a
moderate depressive disorder and a moderate anxiety disor-
der (Snaith & Zigmond, 1994; Spinhoven et al., 1997). There
is a moderate anxiety disorder present in the nonalexithymic
group but no depressive disorders. In another study in which
the HADS is conducted in a sample of 301 FM patients, the
mean score on the anxiety scale was 12.69 and 10.12 on the
depression scale (Vallejo et al., 2012).
Data Collection
Focus groups were used as they are well suited for producing
broad information on patients' perceptions, feelings,
thoughts, and experiences about the selected topics. The
power of the focus group is situated in the interaction

between respondents and in identifying their feelings and
motives. As the interview takes place in a group setting, the
data are strongly dependent on the interaction between the
participants (Howitt, 2013). Both focus groups were guided
by the same experienced moderator who used a semi-struc-
tured interview (see appendix). Each focus group had an
average duration of 60 minutes and was audiotaped and tran-
scribed verbatim. All participants gave written informed
consent and were assured of anonymity and confidentiality.
Data Analysis
The process of data analysis involved a typical pattern of
open coding, axial coding, and identifying themes and sub-
themes (see Appendix Table A1). First, the interview tran-
scripts were read several times to become familiar with the
data. During the open encoding, texts were broken down into
discrete parts, which form a meaningful whole and were
labeled. Axial encoding involves connecting these open
codes and creating a concept (i.e. a description of related
codes). Finally, the concepts were grouped in themes and
subthemes (Howitt, 2013). Results were continuously com-
pared with literature and adjusted during analysis. Two inde-
pendent researchers analyzed data and discussed on themes
and subthemes. In case of different interpretation, a third
experienced clinician was consulted (triangulation).
Theoretical saturation was not reached.
Results
Descriptions on how the included FM patients experience
their body can be classified into three themes: the lived body
is hyper present, alienation of the lived body, and the lived
body in interaction with others. These themes are presented
below, along with corresponding subthemes (see Table 3 for
an overview).
Theme 1: The Lived Body Is Hyper Present
The theme, "the lived body is hyper present" was constructed
from the following subthemes: (a) an actual, present physical
body; (b) living in a painful world; and (c) feeling of having
a heavy body.
An actual, present physical body indicates a body that
becomes apprehended as a biological entity. The entire body,
from the tip of the finger to little toe, appears on the fore-
ground in the subjective experience of the patient.
Any piece of my trunk hurts. It is like an inflammation, as if all
my nerves are exposed.
Before diagnosis or onset of symptoms, the body was
present without being aware of it. Participants described this
as an "obvious and fluent body," which can be defined as an
invisible embodied body or a body at the background of
attention.
Living in a painful world indicates the impact of chronic
pain and associated fatigue. Activities of daily life, such as
cooking, ironing and cleaning, can no longer be performed
effortlessly. Climbing stairs, for example, becomes the focus
of the attention.
In going up or down the stairs at home, now I should pull myself
up to the railing, step by step.
The feeling of having a heavy body means that the body is
experienced as a weight that has to be dragged. The partici-
pants described this as if their body always remains a few
steps behind, as if the body cannot follow the mind.
Before I had no idea of my body. Although it was there, I just got
up, did all I had to do throughout the day. And now I get up and
I need to drag myself out of that bed and drag myself day after
day.
Theme 2: Alienation of the Lived Body
The feeling of having a heavy body is described by another
participant as follows:

I feel like I'm riding with a Ferrari to a mountaintop: a lot of
accelerating, but not moving forward. It's as if you're driving
with the brakes on.
This mechanical expression is in line with the theme
"alienation from the lived body." Here, we can distinguish
two subthemes: (a) the body as a machine and (b) the alien-
ated body.
The body as a machine refers to mechanical descriptions
of the body. The body is seen as a "faltering machine" or a
"car that is used up." Something does not work properly any-
more and should be restored by the therapist.
There is something blocked in my body and because of this I
have more pain. This should be mobilized or loosened.
The alienated body refers to a body that is experienced as
"not mine." The body that I am is different than it used to be
before the onset of symptoms.
That's another body, that's no longer my body, that's no longer
me.
Theme 3: The Lived Body in Interaction With
Others
The third theme, "the lived body in interaction with others"
refers to the importance of interindividual aspect of body
awareness. Although both themes, "the lived body is hyper
present" and "alienation of the lived body," concern the indi-
vidual experience of the body, these data suggest a remark-
able influence of the interactions with significant others.
This is surprising as in literature more focus is placed on
intraindividual aspects such as cognition (e.g., Gard, 2005)
and proprio- or interoceptive processing (e.g., Cameron,
2001; Craig, 2003; Tsakiris, 2010). However, the partici-
pants report that the physical complaint in itself is not the
problem but its consequencesfor their daily interactions with
others are. The feeling of being judged and having to defend
themselves because their illness is "medically unexplain-
able" seems to influence their bodily experience to large
extent. The present data suggest that people with FM are
constantly looking for an optimal coping between how they
want to express themselves and how they think they should
behave.
On the one hand, they want to adopt an open attitude in
interaction with others. They try to be single-hearted and
brave while indicating what they are able to and where they
feel limited. Although this is often not the case, they want to
be understood, seen, and heard. Therefore, they consider it
essential to be able to express how they experience their
daily life and not to hide their feelings of tiredness as well as
joy from others. This expressing and not hiding is also and
even foremost experienced on a bodily level where "standing
up" literally is about feeling strong legs to stand on and hav-
ing a firm look while interacting with people.
I have learned to express myself to other people. This is who
I am, these are my limits, this is what I can do, I can have a
meeting in the morning, but not the same day also in the
evening, I can function like this and I keep on doing it this
way.
Before I always pretended--although feeling small--but now I
just look and say it and it's the other one who should adapt. Why
should it always be me who must fit in?
Since I've been power training, my stance has changed
dramatically and it is as if my legs are rooted in plain ground
now . . . once I had an argument with a colleague and I really felt
that I was standing strong!
On the other hand, they express that others should not
always notice (e.g., "everyone should see that I am going
well") or understand them (e.g., "there is nothing to see, peo-
ple can't understand"). This is what makes them actually
prefer not to talk about their situation anymore, indicating a
closed attitude. In addition, a private space in which one
feels safe seems to be important. This can be obtained by
retreating in a personal "cocoon" or by isolating themselves
completely from the environment.
I feel most secure when I would be alone on an island. That
seems a safe situation.
Occasionally I need to sit down in my couch, under a blanket,
wearing my pajamas. Then, others may not sit on my couch.
That is my place. Actually I live in my own territory, my own
space. I accept who I want to, when I want to.
I'm tired of constantly having to explain myself, it makes me so
tired, I feel so exhausted in my body.
My husband knows when he has to leave me alone for a while
. . . the only thing I can bear at that moment is my body around
me.
The behavior or responsiveness of the environment also
seems to be an important factor affecting the physical symp-
toms of the patient. Little understanding, not being seen or
heard by significant others results in more stress and contrib-
utes to an increase of the physical complaints.
People don't understand that you want to. They say you're lazy
or trying to attract some attention. Thereby I feel more stressed,
and I am doing less well.
When my husband or kids are at home, I'm trying real hard not
to sigh or moan, I even walk taller as when my father told me
when I was young to be a big girl.
Alexithymia
The themes and subthemes are applicable to both the
alexithymic and nonalexithymic group. The personality trait
6 SAGE Open
alexithymia had no influence on how these FM patients
experience their body. Based on the qualitative analysis,
some differences can nevertheless be noticed: verbal reac-
tions indicating a lack of mentalization, experiencing more
misunderstanding from the environment and preferring
exercise therapy to a touch-based therapy are more present
in the alexithymic group in comparison with the nonalex-
ithymic group. These differences are described and illus-
trated below.
A first difference with the nonalexithymic group is the
limited ability to express the inner world of feelings, emo-
tions, and mainly focussing on physical sensations. Verbal
reactions indicating a lack of body mentalizationare no
words, empty words, body absolutism, and emphasis on
physical labels (Table 4).
They also indicate the need to be heard, seen, and under-
stood by the environment. Just because they fail to express
their inner world and to indicate their limits, they experience
more misunderstanding from the environment in comparison
with the nonalexithymic group.
I can't say what I feel, I can only say that I have pain at the
moment. So for someone else in your environment, it's even
more difficult. They can't estimate that at all, if I can't even
describe how I feel.
Whereas the nonalexithymic FM patients prefer the com-
bination of hands-on therapy and psychotherapy, the FM
patients with alexithymic characteristics prefer exercise ther-
apyto a therapy in which touch is central. According to them,
the advice and guidance of the psychotherapist offers little
progress (e.g., "After all, we have to do it all by ourselves"),
whereas movement-based therapy seems to have a more suit-
able treatment objective. They focus a lot on stabilizing their
complaints, on recovery, and improvement of their quality of
life without being dependent on others, in this case the
therapist.
My physical therapist teaches me things I can do by myself. This
is important, knowing I am not dependent on someone else.
Discussion
Based on the qualitative data analysis, these FM patients
show characteristics of hyper-embodiment as well as disem-
bodiment. Patients' experiences suggested a lived body,
experienced as a heavy body and living in a painful world,
which was thematically clustered as the lived body is hyper
present. However, there is an alienation of the lived body,
because the body is described as a machine and as strange,
not belonging to the individual. This specific phenomeno-
logical experience of not being one's own body could be in
line with the paradoxical experience of being in pain while
not feeling it as described by Valenzuela-Moguillansky
(2013) in patients with FM. The modification of pain which
these authors label as paradoxical, could be referring to a
process of coping by alienating from one's body as in disem-
bodiment. A kind of experiential distance or filter is created
between the individual and the body, which results in a deaf-
ened effect on the pain. These occurred especially when
patients were suddenly or intensely confronted with stress as
in anxiety or panic and could--on a bodily level--be in line
with the mechanism of derealization in traumatized people.
However, hyper-embodiment seemed to be more present
during normal daily life when patients have to deal with less
unexpected disturbing arousal. Here they described to be
absorbed by their body, experiencing it as a burden or heavy
weight that has to be dragged.
This possibility of the lived body moving back and forth
is why it is more appropriate to consider embodiment as a
dimensional construct with hyper- and disembodiment at
each end of a spectrum (Figure 2). Although, in both condi-
tions, the body is present in the forefront of the subjective
experience, hyper-embodiment is about an oppressing and
solid body object, where the patient is trapped in, whereas in
disembodiment, the body is an alienated apparatus that can-
not be inhabited anymore (Fuchs & Schlimme, 2009). It is
important to emphasize that hyper- and disembodiment also
have a normal range and should not be interpreted as patho-
logical concepts as such. Typical example here is the fight/
flight state in which an individual is normally and function-
ally detached from his body awareness to cope with a possi-
ble situation, whereas a sensual massage invites to a more
intensive aware experience of the body. So to escape or
enjoy, a normal fluctuation or shift in dis- or hyper-embodied
states is needed. The problem, however, with a more dys-
functional appearance of embodiment appears when the nor-
mal flow on the hyper- and disembodiment spectrum got
stuck to some level. In that case, the lived body cannot adept
properly to any given situation in daily life.
Moreover, in general health, the lived body is implicitly
present in every action (Söderberg et al., 2002) and so the
body "dis-appears" from the attention (Zeiler, 2010). Only in
specific situations--such as in case of hunger, thirst, desire,
fatigue, or pain--the body becomes present as a biological

2009).

entity (Denys & Meynen, 2011; Seligman, 2010; Wilde,
2003). Otherwise, attention is not always directed toward the
body and, as stated--for example, in acute danger--atten-
tion is more focused on the environment instead of the body.
So an explanation for both the hyper- and disembodied expe-
riences of the FM patients in this study could be the ability to
make a temporarily shift or switch from hyper- to disembodi-
ment due to certain emotional state or stress. Still, the present
data suggest that the equilibrium tends to hyper-embodiment
in FM.
The third theme--the lived body in interaction with oth-
ers--is a remarkable interindividual aspect of body aware-
ness. Merleau-Ponty defines this as intercorporeality,
indicating that the experience to be embodied is always
mediated by our continuous bodily interaction with others
(Stanghellini, 2009). Being in the world and interacting with
others occurs first and foremost on a bodily level as we con-
tact as "body to body," mostly on an unconscious level in an
embodied space. That is why Merleau-Ponty states that inter-
corporeality or embodiment is in particular prereflective and
canbeseenasakindofunconsciousattunement(Stanghellini,
2009). This prereflective attunement and body-mediated
intercorporeality seem to find--at least to some extent--
their neurobiological substrate in mirror neurons as is
increasingly demonstrated in literature. Not only higher
order decision making, language, or cognition in general are
rooted in the mirror neuron system of a person but also
embodiment itself is mirror neuron­based as stated by
Gallese and Ebisch (2013): "In other words, by exploiting
the same neural circuits as those recruited for first-person
bodily experiences, a direct intersubjective link is estab-
lished between self and other allowing an experiential under-
standing of others bodily feelings" (p. 279). Focused on
social cognition, this embodied understanding also appears
in what is called embodied simulation where people are
thought to reuse their own mental states represented with a
bodily format in functionally attributing them to others
(Gallese & Sinigaglia, 2011; Kyselo, 2014; Winters, 2008).
These key notions on the embodied basis of intersubjective
attunement or evaluation are reflected in the third theme,
where on one hand, the participants want to be understood,
seen, and heard by their environment (i.e., open attitude). On
the other hand, they also state that the environment not often
understands their preference not to speak about themselves
(i.e., closed attitude). In general, they are confronted with
misunderstanding from others. A number of studies attribute
this misunderstanding to the invisibility of the symptoms, a
general lack of knowledge about FM and the perception that
the illness is "psychological" and therefore not legitimate
(McMahon et al., 2012). This theme reflects the "intercorpo-
reality" dimension of the lived body, where people not only
try to cope on a bodily level with their surrounding by, for
example, standing tall and having a firm gaze. But also the
consequences of this prereflective and bodily attunement
appear in this third theme as in "feeling tired of being
judged." Interesting and striking at the same time is that both
the open and closed attitude appear in an embodied way in
their narrative and behavior, for example, when a participant
tells that the couch where she is sitting on, wrapped in her
blanket, is her space and territory where her body cannot
bear anyone close.
Alexithymia
Based on literature, the alexithymic individual was thought
to be characterized by a disembodied state of being in the
world. Many theorists have explained alexithymia as a dis-
connection between the objective mind and the emotional
experienced body, in short, a disconnection between body
and mind. An alexithymic individual is thereby characterized
by a lack of emotional involvement in the world. Instead, this
person is in an objective and instrumental way involved in
the world and seems to be disconnected from his or her body
(Maclaren, 2006). This was not confirmed by the qualitative
data from this study. The way alexithymic FM patients
describe how they experience their body is surprisingly simi-
lar to these in the nonalexithymic group.Alexithymic patients
are primarily failing in expressing their bodily experiences

without actually being disembodied could be a possible
explanation.
Compared with the nonalexithymic group, some differ-
ences could nevertheless be noticed: (a) verbal reactions
pointing to a lack of mentalization, (b) more misunderstand-
ing from the environment, and (c) preferring exercise ther-
apy instead of hands-on therapy. Clinical observations and
controlled studies have confirmed that psychotherapeutic
treatments of alexithymic patients are difficult (Vanheule et
al., 2011). Alexithymia seems a negative prognostic indica-
tor for many psychological treatments, particularly those
focusing on emotional awareness and a close relationship
with the therapist (Lumley et al., 2007; Vanheule et al.,
2011). Behavioral treatments are more appropriate because
of a more structured, externally oriented and concrete
approach (Baranowsky et al., 2009). Also mentalization-
based therapy may be suitable for alexithymic patients
(Baranowsky et al., 2009; Vanheule et al., 2011). Still, it is
important to note that therapists not always have to use ver-
balization to stimulate the mentalization process. For exam-
ple, body awareness interventions, emphasizing on being
aware of the body without the need to be verbalized, can be
an option. In this type of interventions, therapists can choose
to use a hands-on or hands-off approach. The efficacy of
these treatment methods in FM patients is still under debate
(Gard, 2005; Ogrodniczuk et al., 2011).
Conclusion
In the literature, authors distinguish two forms of disturbed
body awareness: "disembodiment" and "hyper-embodi-
ment." These concepts are already described in the context of
melancholic depression and schizophrenia. To date, both
concepts are not used in the context of FM. This study
describes how FM patients experience their body and
explores whether these patients can be categorized in dis- or
hyper-embodiment).
Characteristics of both concepts were established and
classified in two themes: the lived body is hyper present
(hyper-embodiment) and alienation from the lived body (dis-
embodiment). As both characteristics were present, we can
conclude that FM patients cannot exclusively be classified in
hyper- or disembodiment. The phenomenology of the hyper-
embodied state seemed to be more present during normal
daily life when patients have to deal with less unexpected or
disturbing situations. In contrast with this hyperembodiment,
the state of disembodiment occurred particularly when
patients were suddenly or intensely confronted with stress
(for exampleanxiety or panic). So considering embodiment
as a dimensional construct with hyper-embodiment and dis-
embodiment on both sides of the spectrum, the equilibrium
tends to hyper-embodiment, including the possibility of a
temporary, state-dependent shift of this equilibrium from
hyper- to disembodiment. Finally, these qualitative data also
showed an important interpersonal aspect in body awareness
(the lived body in interaction with others), in line with
Merleau-Ponty's concept of intercorporeality as a prereflec-
tive and unconscious attunement on a bodily level.
In addition, a difference in body awareness between FM
patients with and without alexithymic characteristics was
investigated. Based on the literature, it was hypothesized that
an alexithymic individual was characterized by a disembod-
ied state. Nevertheless, this study illustrates that the person-
ality trait alexithymia has no influence on how FM patients
experience their body.
Alexithymic patients primarily failing in expressing their
bodily experiences without actually being disembodied
could be a possible explanation. Compared with the nonalex-
ithymic group, some differences characterizing the alexithy-
mic participants can nevertheless be noticed: the presence of
verbal reactions pointing to a lack of mentalization, experi-
encing more misunderstanding from the environment and
preferring exercise therapy instead of hands-on therapy.
Strengths and Limitations
Two independent researchers discussed the present findings
until agreement (investigator triangulation). Data were dis-
cussed in a transdisciplinary way and approached from dif-
ferent theoretical perspectives. A first methodological
limitation is the number of participants in the study, causing
a lack of theoretical saturation. This implies that certain
aspects remain questionable and that the relationship between
the different themes is not yet fully elaborated. In addition, it
is possible that the presence of individuals with depressive
characteristics in both focus groups biased the results because
depression has an influence on how the body is experienced
(Luyten & Fonagy, 2011). Finally, two respondents with a
score 53 on the TAS-20 were classified in the nonalexithy-
mic group, whereas the cut-off score is 51.
Implications for Clinicians
Hands-on interventions, aiming at improving body aware-
ness,suchasFasciaTherapyMethodDanisBois,Feldenkrais,
Rolfing, or Rosen Method Bodywork can be seen as recom-
mendable therapeutic approaches in FM. We suggest that
hands-off body awareness interventions are more appropri-
ate in case of alexithymic FM patients. In addition, therapists
must be aware of embodiment as a result of both individual
and inter-individual processing adding up to the first person
experience of a lived body. This is why techniques focusing
on expressing how the body is lived and improving body
mentalization can be used in alexithymic FM patients
because they fail to describe their bodily signals in a clear
way, leading to misunderstanding from the environment,
which in turn can affect overall body experience. It is impor-
tant to note that therapists should treat FM patients using a
staged or phase-oriented approach, starting with bodywork
and gradually working toward verbalization, but always
Calsius et al. 9
starting from the lived body experience of being in and inter-
acting with the world.
Recommendations for Future Research
More comprehensive research on this topic is needed. Not
only exploring in more detail what elements determine a
state of hyper- or disembodiment in FM or how they are
described and experienced in several different contexts but
also researching the factors that could influence or cause a
shift between hyper- and disembodiment remain largely
unknown.
