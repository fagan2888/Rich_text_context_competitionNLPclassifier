Health Insurance Expansions
For Working Families: A
Comparison Of Targeting
Strategies
Finding the right criteria for targeting insurance expansions is crucial
to maximizing the number of newly covered persons.
by Danielle H. Ferry, Bowen Garrett, Sherry Glied, Emily K. Greenman,
and Len M. Nichols
ABSTRACT: We compare three eligibility criteria for targeting health insurance expansions
in working families: poverty, hourly wages, and employment in a small firm. Making
pairwise comparisons among these, we find that targeting by poverty is the most effective
and efficient. A poverty-based method is also the most effective way to target those lacking
access to employer-sponsored insurance and those with low take-up of such coverage.
When we examine the effectiveness of targeting by family type, we find that marital status
and number of workers in the family make little difference once we control for the presence
of children and for poverty level.
Over the past several years analysts have suggested a wide range of
incremental health insurance expansion options to cover the more than
forty million Americans who are uninsured. These options include indi-
vidual tax credits, public program expansions, alternative purchasing arrange-
ments, and employer subsidies. An often-neglected aspect of these programs' de-
tails is the choice of eligibility critera. This choice is important because the uninsured
are a heterogeneous group.1 Some uninsured persons have low wages but not low in-
comes. Others work in small firms but have higher wages. When an eligibility crite-
rion is chosen, some uninsured persons will be included, and others will not.
There are two important gauges of the success of an eligibility criterion: (1) the
number of uninsured persons who will be made eligible under this criterion, mea-
sured as a proportion (which we refer to as target effectiveness); and (2) the propor-

tion of the population newly eligible under this criterion that is uninsured (which
we refer to as target efficiency). If target efficiency is low, crowding out, or the pro-
portion of already insured persons taking up coverage, will generally be high. A
good policy should seek to maximize target effectiveness and efficiency, but these
goals are often at odds with one another.
This paper compares three targeting criteria: family income measured relative
to the federal poverty level, individual hourly wages, and employment in a small
firm. As other analysts have, we chose these criteria because uninsurance is con-
centrated among the poor and among those without access to employer coverage.
The latter, in turn, are largely employed in low-wage jobs and small firms. In 1999,
63.2 percent of the nonelderly uninsured had family incomes below 200 percent of
poverty.2 Similarly, 75.8 percent of the uninsured in working families had no access
to employer coverage in 1998.3 Thirty-four percent of uninsured workers in 1999
were employed in firms with fewer than ten employees.4
Targeting Criteria
n Poverty. Proposals that target families by poverty limit eligibility to individu-
als and families whose incomes fall below a specified percentage of the poverty level,
a measure that adjusts for family size and number of children. In 1999, for example, a
family of three (one child) with income below $13,410 or a family of four (two chil-
dren) with income below $16,530 both had incomes below 100 percent of poverty.
Examples of poverty-based programs include Medicaid and State Children's
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) expansions, which raise the upper income eli-
gibility limit for existing programs or extend eligibility to new groups. For exam-
ple, many states have expanded Medicaid to cover persons with family incomes up
to 200 percent of poverty (some even higher). Tax-credit proposals often also use
poverty-based eligibility criteria.5
n Wages. Proposals that are administered through the workplace may target by
hourly earnings, since firms know their workers' wage earnings and can easily de-
termine eligibility. Plans that use wage criteria generally fall into two subgroups:
those that encourage employers to offer insurance, and those that induce workers to
take up insurance that is offered. Options of the first type may provide a subsidy for
the firm's share of the premium or allow employers to offer coverage through a pub-
lic program buy-in.6 Programs to improve take-up usually subsidize the employee
contribution to a group plan.
n Small firms. Some proposals target workers in small firms.7 Small firms do not
benefit from the economies of scale in administrative costs achieved by large firms
and are at a disadvantage in negotiating premium rates with insurance companies.
Nearly all establishments with at least 1,000 employees offered health coverage in
1998, compared with 83.8 percent of firms employing twenty-five to ninety-nine
workers and 35.9 percent of firms with fewer than ten employees.8

Data And Methods
We used data drawn from the 2000 March supplement (Annual Demographic
Survey) of the Current Population Survey (CPS). For some analyses we used a
match of the 1999 February (Contingent Workers and Alternative Employment
Supplement) and 1999 March files.9
We adjusted the data to reflect health insurance purchasing units and assigned
each person a primary source of insurance.10 We calculated hourly wages (based
on earnings and on weeks and hours worked) and treated respondents with com-
puted hourly wages below $1 as nonworkers. We limited our sample to families
with at least one worker and excluded Medicaid recipients and the elderly (age
sixty-five and older), most of whom receive Medicare. Our weighted sample repre-
sents 196 million persons in working families, 31.5 million of whom are uninsured.
We defined three subgroups based on eligibility criteria: poor/near-poor--in-
come below 200 percent of poverty; low wage--families in which at least one
worker earned hourly wages of $6.82 or less (other workers in the family may earn
more); and small firm--families with at least one worker employed in an estab-
lishment with fewer than ten employees (other workers in the family may be em-
ployed in larger firms). We present some analyses for employees only, excluding
family members and the self-employed. For employees we used a different wage
cutoff ($7.50) and firm-size cutoff (under twenty-five) to equalize population size
with poor/near-poor employees.
The number of uninsured persons covered under any eligibility criteria depends
critically on population size. Proposals with universal eligibility would include
everyone and have 100 percent target effectiveness. For this reason, we chose the
wage cutoff to make poverty/wage comparisons over similar-size populations.
Using these cutoffs, there are approximately equal numbers of persons (forty-four
million) in poor/near-poor and low-wage families. The CPS reports firm size in in-
tervals (for example, under 10, 10­25), so we could not exactly match the popula-
tion- and firm-size criteria. We came the closest by specifying small firm size as
fewer than ten workers. There are nearly four million more persons in small-firm
families than in poor/near-poor families.
Many proposals use higher thresholds than the ones we used here, although
proposals that have received the most attention in Congress tend to use thresh-
olds more like ours.11 We compared our target populations to those that would be
obtained from defining poor/near-poor, low wage, and small firm more conserva-
tively and more liberally in Exhibit 1.12
Evaluating Policy Options
n Cost and coverage implications. Exhibit 2 compares the effectiveness, effi-
ciency, and crowding out associated with each targeting criterion. We report
crowding out under the assumption that 15 percent of the insured and 50 percent of
the uninsured take up insurance.13 In the top panel, the poverty-based criterion out-

performs both the wage and firm-size criteria in terms of target effectiveness, target
efficiency, and crowding out.14 The wage-based criterion is slightly more effective
and efficient at targeting the uninsured than is the small-firm criterion. We obtain
the same rank ordering when we focus on employees only in the bottom panel.
Again, the poverty-based criterion performs the best on all counts.
n Who is excluded? Who is included no matter what? When a choice is made
between two policy options, some people are left out. Other people qualify under ei-
ther option. When there is a great amount of overlap, cost and coverage consider-
ations can take a backseat to other issues such as ease of administration or outreach.
We explore these possibilities here, comparing (separately) a poverty-based
criterion with one based on wages or firm size, and then comparing the wage-
based criterion to the firm-size criterion. The top panel of Exhibit 3 shows that a
criterion that excludes low-wage families and includes poor/near-poor families
covers more of the uninsured and targets more efficiently than does one that in-
cludes low-wage families and excludes the poor/near-poor. Nine and a half million
uninsured persons are in families that are both poor/near-poor and low wage. An
additional 7.8 million uninsured persons live in families that are poor/near-poor
but that do not include a low-wage worker. Only 2.4 million live in families with a
low-wage worker but are not poor/near-poor.
Estimates of target effectiveness and target efficiency reflect these differences.
Nearly 25 percent of the uninsured live in families that are poor/near-poor but not
low wage. Only 7.7 percent live in families that are low wage but not poor/near-
poor. Among all those in families that are poor/near-poor but not low wage,
one-third are uninsured. Among those in families with a low-wage worker who

are not poor/near-poor, only 10 percent are uninsured. The middle panel of Exhibit
3 shows that poor/near-poor families are also more effective and efficient targets
than are small-firm families that are not poor/near-poor. There is no difference be-
tween the effectiveness of low-wage and small-firm targets, however, as shown in
the bottom panel of Exhibit 3. A low-wage target is more efficient, though, be-
cause families that include a small-firm worker have high incomes.
n Firm offers and take-up of insurance. Proposals seek to expand employer-
sponsored insurance by increasing offer rates or employee take-up rates. In Exhibit
4 we examine whether poverty, wages, or firm size are the best predictors of offers
and take-up. We defined the offer rate as the proportion of workers with a direct of-
fer of employer coverage. Employees who do not have an offer (or who do not take up
an offer) may nonetheless have coverage through a family member's employer. To
capture this dimension of coverage, we defined the access rate as the proportion of

individuals with an offer in their family. The family employer coverage take-up rate
is the proportion of people with access covered by employer coverage. Employer
coverage and health insurance rates are the proportions of individuals covered by
employer-sponsored insurance and by any insurance at all, respectively.
Poor/near-poor workers have higher individual offer rates than do those earn-
ing low wages or employed in small firms. At the family level, though, these results
are reversed. Poor/near-poor persons have less access to employer coverage, are
less likely to take up this coverage when offered it, are less likely to be covered by
employer insurance at all, and, consequently, are less likely to be insured than are

those in low-wage and small-firm families. People in low-wage families, which fre-
quently include a higher-wage worker (65 percent), have the greatest access to
employer coverage and are therefore most likely to be insured through an em-
ployer. Those in small-firm families, who generally have high incomes (78 percent
have incomes over 200 percent of poverty), have greater take-up of employer cov-
erage and overall higher insurance coverage rates.
n Targeting family types. Social policies such as Medicaid and cash welfare as-
sistance have historically given priority to children and parents. In considering
health insurance expansions, it is useful to know whether it is more effective or effi-
cient to target some family types over others. Exhibit 5 shows the effectiveness and
efficiency of targeting six family types. The first four types are families in which the
primary earner is married, by whether there are two or more workers or only one
worker and by the presence of children. The other two groups are families in which
the primary earner is single, by the presence of children. We only report results for
people in poor/near-poor families to focus attention on the differences among family

types within the group we already determined to be the most effectively and effi-
ciently targeted.
In Exhibit 5 those with a single primary earner in poor/near-poor families are
the largest group, representing about 20 percent of the uninsured (in working
families). Almost 12 percent of the uninsured are in poor/near-poor families with
children in which there is only one married earner. About 9 percent of the unin-
sured are in poor/near-poor families with children where the primary earner is
single. Within groups with children who have similar incomes, we find that target
efficiency is relatively unaffected by marital status and the number of workers in
the family. Target efficiency is, however, much higher among poor/near-poor fam-
ily types without children than among those with children. Since more than half
of those in this group are now uninsured, and few are eligible for public programs,
making this group eligible for new coverage would crowd out relatively little ex-
isting coverage.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that poverty is a better targeting criterion for health insur-
ance expansions than either wages or firm size. Since they target the uninsured
more efficiently, proposals focusing on poor/near-poor families are likely to be less
costly (per newly insured person). Among the poor/near-poor, differences in tar-
get efficiency are driven mainly by the presence of children. A large fraction of the
poor/near-poor uninsured are in childless families. Targeting (or at least not ex-
cluding) childless families, who have historically been excluded from subsidized
health insurance programs, would be relatively efficient.
These results raise the issue of how to weigh the pros and cons of various target-
ing strategies. A complete evaluation of policy options would consider more than
just target effectiveness and efficiency. As mentioned above, wage-based options
would be relatively easy to administer since employers already carry out many of
the administrative functions that would be needed. Moreover, employers could in-
form workers of their eligibility in conjunction with benefits notifications.
Policymakers might prefer a less effective or efficient proposal if it had administra-
tive and outreach advantages. This is a trade-off that analysis can identify but can-
not resolve without explicit value judgments.

8. Authors' tabulations of the 1998 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).
9. We matched the 1999 February and March files using a household ID and a unique identifier for each indi-
vidual within the household (and confirming matches using age, sex, and race). Approximately 64 percent
of the observations in the February survey match correctly with the March CPS. Observation weights
were then calibrated so that the total weighted population (all ages) matches Census Bureau estimates for
1998.
10. We rank sources of coverage, in descending order of importance: employer coverage in one's own name,
employer coverage in another's name, Medicare, Medicaid, military insurance, and individual coverage.
11. For example, Jack Meyer and Elliott Wicks allow firms with average wages of $10 an hour or less to qual-
ify for their program. Meyers and Wicks, "A Federal Tax Credit." Sara Rosenbaum and colleagues provide
employee subsidies to workers earning up to $16 an hour and employer subsidies for workers earning
$8.50 an hour or less. Rosenbaum et al., "Allowing Small Businesses." Jonathan Gruber and Larry Levitt
assume that the tax credit is available to all singles with incomes below $60,000 and families with in-
comes below $100,000. J. Gruber and L. Levitt, "Tax Subsidies for Health Insurance: Costs and Benefits,"
Health Affairs (Jan/Feb 2000): 72­85.
12. We set the low and high income cutoffs for individuals at 100 and 300 percent of poverty. The higher wage
cutoff of $12.50 corresponds to hourly earnings of a single full-time worker earning three times the federal
poverty level, and the lower wage cutoff of $5.15 is the minimum wage. Because of restrictions in the data,
we offer only higher thresholds for firm size--under twenty-five and under ninety-nine employees.
13. While effectiveness and efficiency measures are "facts" that can be measured directly from survey data,
measures of crowding out depend on estimates of behavioral effects. The estimates we use here are taken
from S. Glied, D. Remler, and J. Zivin, "Approaches to Modeling Health Insurance Expansions: A Compar-
ison of Methods and Assumptions" (Background paper prepared for Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
conference, Washington, D.C., March 2001). Note that we experimented with different assumptions
about take-up and find that our results are relatively insensitive to those changes.
14. Since there are nearly four million more persons in working families with a small-firm employee than in
those considered poor/near-poor, only ballpark comparisons are possible.
